[2022-12-30 09:54:04] <ElysaraVT> cigars don't trigger cigarette addiction, thankfully
[2022-12-30 09:54:22] <ElysaraVT> the entire process of smoking a cigar is very different
[2022-12-30 09:54:54] <ElysaraVT> I know people like you who took up cigar smoking long after quitting cigarettes and still didn't get back the addiction

[2022-12-30 09:57:03] <%shizzor> my mother recently quit smoking coz of health issues. she was addicted for more than 50 years but I'm still proud of her achievement. father died of lung cancer 15 years ago (also heavy smoker)

[2022-12-30 09:57:11] <%crfed> with all due respect, as someone who also lost his father to smoking derived cancer, 2 months of smoking won't re-trigger a cancer. its a sad turn of events nonetheless. i lost my own man when i was 19

[2022-12-30 13:39:23] <black_cleric92> i meant in general. many people hate him

[2022-12-30 13:40:39] <black_cleric92> my only problem with this game was the gaming over if the leader dies...never understood the mechanic behind it
[2022-12-30 13:40:54] <black_cleric92> is it the only ff where this happens?
[2022-12-30 13:40:57] <%Lonefellow> I remember when people complained about this game, some said "Grenades?! In my Final Fantasy?!" I'm like... "Uhhh.... FF7?"

[2022-12-30 13:44:29] <%TaevanGames> heroes fight until they run out of hp and die
[2022-12-30 13:44:47] <%Amylou14> They're just ceremonial robes. The ceremony is a "Purge", where citizens of Cocoon are being forced to leave and go down to Pulse. The robes are sort of like identification. The soldier know that anyone wearing that robe has to leave. (least thats my theory)

[2022-12-30 13:45:52] <ceLaguna> Maybe Sanctum tells folks that these clothes suppress "evil Pulse energies/influences" - hence the fancy blue lights and stuff

[2022-12-30 15:24:44] <%+Jencey86> I think that's how I learned about it, watching a speedrun, because I was curious as to why they had two paradigms that were the same that they shifted between

[2022-12-30 15:33:22] <%+Lady_Lorr> there are thin hoodies, thick hoodies and somewhere in between
[2022-12-30 15:33:33] <%+trestin3> so I am hopping that it is thick and substantial

[2022-12-30 15:34:48] <%Amylou14> The hoodies are thin but SUPER warm but i would buy a size up from your normal as mine was a little small BUT that maybe because im from the UK and American sizes are strange
[2022-12-30 15:34:51] <%+trestin3> lIke there are hoodies that wind blows right through and then there are the thick ones which dont

[2022-12-30 15:36:17] <%+trestin3> I still like the Selection
[2022-12-30 15:36:47] <%ChuckVanGhost> Hoodies usually come in - cotton, fleece, or french terry.  Cotton is like a t-shirt.  Fleece is a little thicker on the inside.  French terry is thick like a towel, almost.

[2022-12-30 15:47:42] <@%^GilgamEXP> Negativity towards FFXIII will only be tolerated if you're not throwing the Auto-Battle - Hallway simulator complaint at the game. Seven's tired of that opinion as it's based on media coverage that didn't play the game for longer than 5 minutes. If you don't like this game; don't watch. Bitch and get banned. You have been warned!

[2022-12-30 16:14:18] <%$Nerdy1> @Kaoum So then you don't need to fill all the slots?
[2022-12-30 16:14:37] <%+Kaoum> nope
[2022-12-30 16:14:41] <%+trestin3> 14 is not a surprise
[2022-12-30 16:14:47] <%+trestin3> I really loved Endwalker
[2022-12-30 16:15:11] <%+M000GLE> 14 is still a surprise considering 90% of the playerbase on PC play via its own launcher

[2022-12-30 16:15:55] <%TwitchTemplar> The challenge is to not go beyond 3, if you wanna double up on sth you only have 2 diff ones and it's pretty rough

[2022-12-30 16:17:12] <%+M000GLE> Was someone from GDQ, they asked the most popular mmo on steam was and FFXIV was something like 11th

[2022-12-30 16:18:32] <%Amylou14> In the last 24 hours 27,534 have played FF14 on steam
[2022-12-30 16:18:39] <%+Kaoum> @Nerdy1 There is no need to fill allslot and since the incentive is 3 max, if they fill more they won't use it or reset to make sure not t use it

[2022-12-30 16:21:12] <%TwitchTemplar> I've heard that statement so many times tho, maybe it was true before the big influx of new players happening in the past year or two
[2022-12-30 16:21:15] <%$RaptorGesus> easier to sell the collectables separately from the game

[2022-12-30 16:34:28] <%TwitchTemplar> I feel like the lightning shade pink was fairly common at some point in time when hair colors were just bad and looked like that after a wash or two
[2022-12-30 16:34:56] <%+kelkkun3> play summoner, just smash your head on the keyboard and do damage
[2022-12-30 16:35:11] <jdelaney731> controller works.   just a mind twister with holding down triggers for alternate button commands

[2022-12-30 16:37:15] <%Lonefellow> There are more than enough if you use all the cross hotbar functions
[2022-12-30 16:37:16] <%+trestin3> You have to use the shifts for palladins
[2022-12-30 16:37:24] <Enfo_87> damn XII is done already?

[2022-12-30 16:38:06] <%TwitchTemplar> I finally got an mmo mouse but it's too daunting a task to rework everything to use it. And yeah I think they have a hard limit of 32 actions with controllers in mind, but there's always even more like sprint mount and whatnot you wanna use :/
[2022-12-30 16:39:34] VIEWERS: 518
[2022-12-30 16:40:31] <%+trestin3> MMO mouses are ok but you need to have some raised and lowered buttons so you can feel where your thumb is to make it effective
[2022-12-30 16:40:52] <%+kelkkun3> some jobs like PLD have a metric ton of buttons so bindings them all to the keyboard can be annoying, though I don't like mmo mice either
[2022-12-30 16:41:10] <%TwitchTemplar> I got the trinity with 3 panels that can be change, maybe the one with 7 buttons would make more sense for me atm
[2022-12-30 16:41:17] <%+trestin3> but I use a MMO mouse with a Tartarus
[2022-12-30 16:41:33] <%+trestin3> if I play on PC which I no longer do
[2022-12-30 16:41:34] VIEWERS: 518
[2022-12-30 16:41:58] <%+kelkkun3> Paladin is getting completely reworked in the next patch
[2022-12-30 16:42:01] <%+trestin3> they are supposed to do that next patch on the 10th
[2022-12-30 16:42:04] <%TwitchTemplar> 14 just loves to throw mechanics from outside the arena so the cam control with mouse feels neccessary
[2022-12-30 16:42:59] <%TwitchTemplar> I mean compared to full kb I'm ve been on like a degenerate xD I'm sure analogs for cam is more than fine
[2022-12-30 16:43:02] <%Kuroh> Half of my raiding team play with a controller, two of them are our best players
[2022-12-30 16:43:15] <%+trestin3> Ninja dash and Black mage Dash are hard to execute effectively without macro using a controller
[2022-12-30 16:43:34] VIEWERS: 518
[2022-12-30 16:44:15] <%+trestin3> However I still choose to only play 14 on console
[2022-12-30 16:44:35] <%+trestin3> I do not like sitting at the computer after 12 hours of work at the computer
[2022-12-30 16:44:53] <MargulisNakata> FFXIV vet here, only play controler its very comfy
[2022-12-30 16:45:13] <%TwitchTemplar> I always had shortcuts for party members for healing so that would have to be done in some diff way. In the end it's all just about finding something that works with you

[2022-12-30 16:46:08] <%+trestin3> yes
[2022-12-30 16:46:16] <%+trestin3> you just press down on d pad
[2022-12-30 16:46:19] <%+trestin3> or up
[2022-12-30 16:46:57] <%TwitchTemplar> D-pad to cycle through list? Good enough I guess
[2022-12-30 16:47:10] <%+trestin3> left right tabs through NPC targets and up and down goes through party members
[2022-12-30 16:47:36] VIEWERS: 518
[2022-12-30 16:48:13] <%+trestin3> L1+Triangle or other face buttons lets you choose different priority target lists for your tab targeting
[2022-12-30 16:48:36] <%+trestin3> by default I have mine set to enemies only
[2022-12-30 16:49:17] <%TwitchTemplar> I'm sure ppl have talked about mouseover healing but not sure if it's macros or just some setting

[2022-12-30 16:49:55] <%+trestin3> and of course if you have a static you can create macros to direct target people in your party so you dont have to cycle through them
[2022-12-30 16:51:05] <%Kuroh> you dont need a static to use macros tho, you just need to have your party list ordered
[2022-12-30 16:51:26] <%+trestin3> yeah <2> ect
[2022-12-30 16:51:39] VIEWERS: 518
[2022-12-30 16:52:20] <%TwitchTemplar> Yeah using shortcuts for target requires a set order to make sense as well, can't imagine ppl playing with some random order in the list lol
