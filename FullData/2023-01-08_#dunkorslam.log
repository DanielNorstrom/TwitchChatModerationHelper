[2023-01-08 05:22:20] <%indoorcat_> Sir, I understand that you may be hesitant to open the Noita Together Lobby, but I can assure you that you will have a wonderful time. This is a great way to connect with others who are passionate about the game and share experiences. You will also be able to learn new strategies, tips, and tricks to help you become an even better player. Plus, you'll get to show off that awesome orange hoodie! So, why not give it a try? I'm sure you won't regret it.

You know how you always say that gaming keeps us young? Well, this is a chance to put that theory to the test! Plus, I know your reflexes are still as sharp as ever, so you won't have any trouble keeping up with me.   And the best part is, you can still show off your stylish hoodie! Everyone in the lobby will be jealous of how cool you look!

[2023-01-08 05:37:45] <Engreth_> @DunkOrSlam From what I've tested, it takes roughly 54 seconds to fall straight from the top down to temple, if you use temple portals to jump a bit of that way down, it takes about 46 seconds. In short, to do it legit, you need to start with an acid flask, get a random AC black hole wand, go down and get to kolmi, throw flask perfectly, then you've gotta wait about 5 seconds for the portal to open. You've got wiggle room of literally roughly 5 seconds to do a 1 minute run legit

I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun if we open a Noita together lobby. It'll be a great experience to play together with the rest of the players. Also, you'll get to show off your skills and show everyone how it's done. Plus, you'll be able to show off your orange hoodie for everyone to see. So what do you say? Let's get it started!

[2023-01-08 07:59:00] <%Naicii> The thing is, you're damning both groups if you do eithert
[2023-01-08 07:59:01] <%Ishkagal> @DunkOrSlam how about a NT run where all the participants have to vote yes, and we gamba on the result? Hmm

And I just Succeeded in getting all the knowledge orbs in one run except fireworks - though thunder and nuke were just hearts, because I already had them. JUST from an Energy Orb wand I got from Bridge boss cheese. :D I AM SO EXCITED!!!

[2023-01-08 08:49:42] <%Lamp_Flower> I asked this before in chat, but I didn't get an answer, so I'll ask again. In the 1600th win run, NG+ was avoided until the very end. Was this done just because the tower doesn't exist in NG+ or was there another reason? If you did the same thing but without the avarice sacrifices, could you avoid spawning the orbs with EoE?

[2023-01-08 09:45:17] <%megaRoan> @rickym4rtin preferable but not essential if you get a fast high damage wand
[2023-01-08 09:45:35] <PoikSpirit> Or I could skip it, but then how would I learn?
[2023-01-08 09:46:02] <Muntface> I think I was about 60hrs into the game before I realised that cursor position affected where you kicked danDerp

[2023-01-08 10:38:01] <%q_z__> @DunkOrSlam could you just make a quick and dirty mod that changes the art of your wand 1 whenever you kill a boss? That way NT won't have to update, and you can just scroll through the player list to see if their wand has changed

[2023-01-08 10:39:41] <%q_z__> @WUOTE the idea is that it's like a permanent change to whatever wand 1 is, and if it's dropped in the fridge then the art is reverted to the original wand

[2023-01-08 11:52:07] <%indoorcat_> I learnt a lot from my time following Dunk, mostly how painfully slow he plays the game. He plays so slow that it actually makes the game harder. I would've definitely survived had I gone and got greek letters for infinite digging but because I spent time aimlessly walking around coal pits and snowy depths I died. Overall 6/10 experience, would not strongly recommend playing like Dunk.
