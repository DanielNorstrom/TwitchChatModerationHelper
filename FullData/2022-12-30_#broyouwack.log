[2022-12-30 00:05:56] <JormunCosplayr> Do you think Symmetra mains are more toxic than the whole mercy main community combined??
[2022-12-30 00:06:12] <juicydonutgamer> broyouClown
[2022-12-30 00:06:17] <ender_dear> as a mercy main were more toxic
[2022-12-30 00:06:18] <@%rogue_entity> Because they fudged the system NotLikeThis

[2022-12-30 00:06:40] <decgod04> Y’know I get Blizzard tried to make it so losing games is less devastating but it still feels so annoying and defeating when you do lose

[2022-12-30 00:07:15] <fyrstunt> Do u like the new character
[2022-12-30 00:07:16] <plumdum_ow> The devs made it so valorant players could come in and just roll people on so sojourn/widow so that’s prolly y he was in ur game. Some characters just need aim

[2022-12-30 00:07:49] <!%+Grimreaper3103> This season I tried to be a mercy main but gave up after a few days because my team couldnt do shit and I rolled like 5 games with lucio and Kiriko
[2022-12-30 00:07:57] <redfluffypillow> I'm learning which maps she's not as good on. Sym needs to hit lots of photon ball shots in order to be worth her place in the lobby
[2022-12-30 00:08:02] <juanand0nlyy> Focus healers
[2022-12-30 00:08:05] <nezukoking18> so do you help with the new *** skin

[2022-12-30 01:25:52] <@%ChristalRaine> Yeah the matchmaking in OW2 is legit horrible. It’s why I always tell you to start playing with me or others bc solo queue in OW2 is NOT the same as OW1..

[2022-12-30 01:29:18] <@%ChristalRaine> Dude just take a break, playing while this tilted is so dumb. You have a community of people who love you and 600 people who are here to hang out with you. Rage queueing ranked because you’re tilted at people for not being experienced at the game isn’t fun for anyone. Just take a break, play with pancakes for 10min on stream, play some QP, something.

[2022-12-30 02:01:43] <MCPEHippy> If you think about it, overwatch 2 has removed everything rewarding from the original game. On fire effect, loot boxes, profile borders, etc, and they just haven’t found an alternative for it.
[2022-12-30 02:01:46] <ulbov> u inspired me to try mei more
[2022-12-30 02:01:54] <@%rogue_entity> Its grind heavy with no real rewards, I get that they have to monetize the game to keep it rolling but 60 coins for all weeklies is a big yikes

[2022-12-30 02:05:10] <Braymii> A good comp idea for gold guns is every 5 games you play you get 150 comp points and when you get a certain amount you can roll for a gold gun depending on your top 3 played.

[2022-12-30 02:08:01] <jaxmoonstone> i feel like OW2 became less fun/relaxed when they removed the 2nd tank, cause now as a tank you cant hold a point and have you other tank push or flank and now you whole game depends on just one tank
