[2023-01-11 04:32:47] <!%WesKeltner> @0hleg desync is tricky. push as much as you can to client side (anims, etc), get aggressive with LODs and texture streaming. Each MP game is different, there's no silver bullet.

[2023-01-11 04:37:55] <0hleg> BSGS entire development model is based of generating new sales through sparking interest with interesting updates and drop events. Nothing is based around sustaining player base. Honestly I’d rather pay 10$ per month so they get their money drug hit and can focus on fixing desync and other issues.

[2023-01-11 04:43:02] <@%ForeverAloneHero> @WesKeltner they are just missing the point altogether. 3 years ago chat whined "add more servers". even tho single server in Emirates was worth 2000/month and they needed 10+ to run.
[2023-01-11 04:43:08] <%Dgtldead> @tat2dsculptor im sure they do care, but they can't satisfy every single person or every single need, all the time
[2023-01-11 04:43:16] <0hleg> @weskeltner yes that is cool and all but I’ve always admired core mechanics like with games that have minimal peekers advantage more than animations. And there are games that do both. So it’s really no excuse.
[2023-01-11 04:43:17] <+TheRazorsEdge_> What would you say is your favorite cryptid creature? @Sequisha
[2023-01-11 04:43:33] <!%WesKeltner> @tat2dsculptor I don't work there. I have no idea what the team thinks or their ethos. But I've hung out with hundreds of diff devs from diff teams. I've never heard one say or mention that they don't give a shit.

[2023-01-11 05:12:14] <%Attckcat> @Tayls10 No, if you want to try it get the cheapest version, and if you like it get EOD during a sale
[2023-01-11 05:12:15] <%+purple_0nion> yea but i'm like.... really bad
[2023-01-11 05:12:19] <letsbrkitt3ns> @ForeverAloneHero yes exactly i know lol. same with english. Pain makes you say the worst words.
[2023-01-11 05:12:21] <%+RocketScience85> @faydeee7 If you enjoy tarkov, yes
[2023-01-11 05:12:22] <%+Swell_Well> Honestly I think some people just get spooked. Especially if you have decent armor and kit on. Maybe they mistake you for pmc
[2023-01-11 05:12:25] <@%ForeverAloneHero> @faydeee7 if it is still on sale. next sale is feb23rd
[2023-01-11 05:12:38] <faydeee7> thanks guys!
[2023-01-11 05:12:45] <rayzorsan> oh , here we go BoneZone
[2023-01-11 05:12:49] <faydeee7> I guess imma wait for Feb 23rd
[2023-01-11 05:12:59] <Mandorake> its  different skeletonized grip i think

[2023-01-11 05:13:05] <%+daybreak137> I had a couple scavs kill me for the FAL I had. I can’t trust any rats anymore
[2023-01-11 05:13:16] <%+DJxLIGHT> I bought edge of darkness before they added Inertia, game was great. Now its a slosh fest.
[2023-01-11 05:13:17] <%+jmagman> Fortis Shift Grip I believe
[2023-01-11 05:13:28] <@%ForeverAloneHero> @faydeee7 it will give you extra stash space (max) some starter items and gamma case
[2023-01-11 05:13:33] <%JaynisK> I think you need it and a Loot Lord iirc
[2023-01-11 05:13:46] <%Tankerdarren> I like that they added durability to scav weapons
[2023-01-11 05:13:54] <%Tankerdarren> like they can be repaired decent now

[2023-01-11 05:14:55] <%juiced_hercules> low
[2023-01-11 05:14:58] <%+DJxLIGHT> Seems like you need to play high sens because all the wonky movement
[2023-01-11 05:15:03] <%lexus8014> @faydeee7 if you're new to tarkov just buy the standard edition and when you like it you can upgrade to eod
[2023-01-11 05:15:20] <%juiced_hercules> you pick your own sens
[2023-01-11 05:15:20] <%+DJxLIGHT> Personal preference I guess
[2023-01-11 05:15:27] <Neerlander> low while aiming atleast @DJxLIGHT
[2023-01-11 05:15:36] <faydeee7> okay got it! thanks a lot guys imma try standard and wait for the discount to upgrade

I honestly can't understand how this is one of the top shooter games and not a no name game with 20 negative reviews

[2023-01-11 12:25:30] <matilozano96> @schwiftyrick_ spawn timing, most likely. Your pmc spawns at the same time as other pmc, so exp players can tell where people might be coming from. Scavs spawn after most pmc's are gone or dead, so its safer
