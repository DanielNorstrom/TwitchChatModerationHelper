They made us food and bought 4 nationwide long distance phones for us to call home. They didn't know any of us, but it was really heartwarming. I vowed then and there never to speak ill of Maine.

[2023-01-11 07:19:54] <Narfmeister> @KodaiRyu I have had issues with drivers in the past where an unhappy CPU lead to breaks ups but if it's 'quiet' but also peaking that suggests that something like a preamp is too high where as the signal going into eco is too low.

[2023-01-11 07:27:11] <+denmer> Sounds like the game is falling back to a cheaper codec probably due to the amount of people in the area. Though just a guess.

[2023-01-11 07:43:05] <jaceeebaby> 90s was the last greatest decade imo
[2023-01-11 07:43:11] <+thatdudejohn62> I thought Burke grew up in the 60s big oof
[2023-01-11 07:43:12] <+Davemented> in a way that's true, zoomers can make songs on computers and publish them online, never having learned an instrument. lots of the newest musicians never played live.

[2023-01-11 07:43:39] <MrTheBest01> 80s music was all very upbeat
[2023-01-11 07:43:39] <$Acewalters> I do find the zoomer's fascination with 90s and 00s fashion interesting, because most of that fashion was just fake nostalgia for the 70s.
[2023-01-11 07:43:41] <+crazylightninglizard> 70s the best

[2023-01-11 09:15:00] <%$dangerousgoods> i think we need a community dump area?
[2023-01-11 09:15:08] <%+electrigasms> "i'm not trying to get rid of it" but you can't dump them and Gassy's banning people
[2023-01-11 09:15:09] <%+ZageDark> If picking up too many tailings is a problem, then reduce the number of tailings that are produced.
[2023-01-11 09:15:10] <+RG_Krupp> Yup, as all eco servers, this is going to fail and become a treehuggers circle
[2023-01-11 09:15:26] <BlazingPilari> if you just wants to grief, why play the game and especially RP?
[2023-01-11 09:15:34] <AirDemon1> Gate keeping the tailings trade monkaS
[2023-01-11 09:15:36] <$travel_motionrs> make a tailings stockpile nerds
[2023-01-11 09:15:41] <Itz_Mango100> hes saying if you only play to grief byebye
[2023-01-11 09:15:51] <%xen_mind> i dont know a game that needs som many rules cant be fun to play
[2023-01-11 09:15:52] <%donne_9> why not make a designated dumping ground for everyone?
[2023-01-11 09:15:52] <Tritoneko> Basically if you continually do it on someone... that's just being rude
[2023-01-11 09:15:53] <%+electrigasms> 100% gate keeping the allowed game activity
[2023-01-11 09:15:54] <barneeb> Just make it so tailings can ONLY be put in stockpile :D

[2023-01-11 09:15:55] <AdriaynWithaY> it sounds like willy is talking about troll-tailing dumping, and burke is asking what he does with his trailings in general
[2023-01-11 09:16:01] <+MesquiteBear> do 40 troll tailings and the rest needs to be properly disposed
[2023-01-11 09:16:08] <skullhead51x> @BurkeBlack why not make it so all unofficial dumped tailings need to be in storage so it's easy to pick up
[2023-01-11 09:16:20] <&%$swiftyspiffy> @admin yes hello?
[2023-01-11 09:16:27] <Bbig> dump the tailings at the police station

[2023-01-11 09:17:12] <+Etep15> Ah ok. Fair
[2023-01-11 09:17:14] <barneeb> The air pollution does the sea level
[2023-01-11 09:17:23] <ProjectCNGG> yeah you need CO2 for sea level :)
[2023-01-11 09:17:41] <@%Stonefather> Just a little dumping KEKLEO
[2023-01-11 09:17:53] <+Etep15> Ah ok.. Then ya. I get the rule. Makes sense.
[2023-01-11 09:17:56] <@%$Sugarist> @Stonefather dumpling?
[2023-01-11 09:17:58] <@%Stonefather> No it wasn't an insane amount
[2023-01-11 09:18:00] <%$dangerousgoods> only 40 truck loads
[2023-01-11 09:18:10] <%justInSoFlo> wow.
[2023-01-11 09:18:29] <+Etep15> But man did Tangent have a mountain of tailings.. lol

[2023-01-11 09:19:05] <+ImpKeeper> idea?, why not have it so citizens can contact the  goverment and have a clean up crew come "aka admins" to just clean it up. or have garbage truck service be able to assist?
[2023-01-11 09:19:05] <BlazingPilari> but why wouldn't you could have fun without?
[2023-01-11 09:19:06] <Mystical_Goddess> I understand some rules, I just don't understand the way they are putting it out there, do this get ban, do this get ban, play the game get ban lol
[2023-01-11 09:19:11] <%ManlyMutt> @J0k3r007_ Is Eli interested? I'm sure they'd LOVE to have him
[2023-01-11 09:19:13] <%imShnaz> @BurkeBlack ask if you can dump more than 40 in like an a designated dumping zone such as underground. a controlled dump
[2023-01-11 09:19:29] <Jacklifear> @BurkeBlack There was one situation where there was 100+ tailings placed, it wasn't involved with you I think
[2023-01-11 09:19:32] <J0k3r007_> I hope so @ManlyMutt
[2023-01-11 09:19:42] <BlazingPilari> @ImpKeeper admins are also volunteer and trying to have some fun
[2023-01-11 09:19:46] <Jacklifear> And there was some RP happening, and it ALL ended as everyone suddenly had to stop and just go
[2023-01-11 09:19:55] <Jacklifear> And it was just a poor experience
[2023-01-11 09:19:55] <+The_Frosted_One> burkeYarr PokPikachu
[2023-01-11 09:20:05] <Jacklifear> Happened a few times. The times you're referencing, those were fine
[2023-01-11 09:20:08] <%ManlyMutt> @J0k3r007_ Tell him to apply if he's interested! He has to apply like everyone else..
[2023-01-11 09:20:08] <+Ssylar2020> i'm not playing then
[2023-01-11 09:20:10] <+ImpKeeper> @ImpKeeper yeah but an admin can make things go puff. they wont need to dig up for hours
[2023-01-11 09:20:15] <skullhead51x> the problem is picking up tailings voxel by voxel is tedious.  But making it so all unofficial dumped tailings need to be in a storage/stockpile would make it much faster to clean up
[2023-01-11 09:20:23] <%+electrigasms> I got direct orders from a streamer so I refuse to feel guilty about it
[2023-01-11 09:20:26] <+Rank2police> I'm concerned that there will be too many ways to accidentally be banned lol
[2023-01-11 09:20:28] <J0k3r007_> Will try
[2023-01-11 09:20:34] <+xJuanMoTacox> everyone on the servers gonna go place their 40 daily limit on gasy front lawn lol
[2023-01-11 09:20:35] <BlazingPilari> @ImpKeeper it's still cleaning other ppl's bs

[2023-01-11 09:20:41] <whataboutbob777> lol
[2023-01-11 09:20:45] <+ImpKeeper> yeah ofcause,
[2023-01-11 09:20:45] <@%Stonefather> It'd be hard to get banned on this server.
[2023-01-11 09:20:56] <AirDemon1> @xJuanMoTacox Thats a good way to protest LuL

[2023-01-11 09:21:00] <+Etep15> Ya you don’t want that.. If it’s clear griefing.. That’s not cool. Agreed
[2023-01-11 09:21:01] <Jacklifear> The other thing is, your dumping created situations to interact/RP. And those were great

[2023-01-11 09:21:29] <+ImpKeeper> <-- i just prefer to be a viewer, and come with idea, i have social anxiety, and i tend to freeze up if it gets too bad, so RP is not always something for me

[2023-01-11 09:21:39] <+CosmicPBnJ> im not 100% sure what tailings are but couldnt you dump them in a bin outside your location and have the waste management collectors come and get it?
[2023-01-11 09:21:44] <%ManlyMutt> Then when they DID notice the air pollution wooo weeee that was a hoot

[2023-01-11 11:14:54] <AshBradford> Some people on the dev team might not be the best to hype up a new game....
[2023-01-11 11:14:54] <%+i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s> its like grounded but better
[2023-01-11 11:14:55] <TinTin__> I've heard of this game the same time they started to talked about grounded. I thought this would come out first
[2023-01-11 11:14:56] <PKM4STER> prob the dev narrating it himself
[2023-01-11 11:14:58] <+GangstersPairOfDice> Bro is the life of the party what are u talking about

[2023-01-11 11:34:32] <Dankotron> this is not a game this is work
[2023-01-11 11:34:34] <Galaxyass> I think it's 100 bucks to get on steam.
[2023-01-11 11:34:34] <PKM4STER> maybe you could do a show and interview game devs
[2023-01-11 11:34:36] <%Lain_2779> I imagine a lot of it is to get noticed
[2023-01-11 11:34:43] <%Lain_2779> if a big streamer picks it up
[2023-01-11 11:34:46] <AshBradford> It depends on how much is just an asset flip and how much the assets cost
[2023-01-11 11:34:46] <Masterhp> i dont think anyone is going to buy this
[2023-01-11 11:34:56] <cgee3too> maybe a couple hundred if they buy assests
[2023-01-11 11:35:00] <%Lain_2779> and a lot of this is made in unreal engine with premade assets
[2023-01-11 11:35:02] <sir_lings_man90> Who even buys then plays them ??
[2023-01-11 11:35:05] <+Delvos> Steam takes alot from indie.  They only get like 25%.  Studio developers get like 60%
[2023-01-11 11:35:09] <+jwaugh45> depends how many people buy the jank games
[2023-01-11 11:35:16] <Dankotron> they just use these games on the resume to get a $200,000 job at a AAA developer
[2023-01-11 11:35:16] <Galaxyass> @BurkeBlack Did you ever play Chernobylite?

[2023-01-11 11:36:08] <$LimaZuluTango> Steam takes 13% of the net revenue I think. For these kinds of games
