[2023-01-07 01:14:39] <fukkit__> You know Baboons are primates comprising the genus Papio, one of the 23 genera of Old World monkeys.  There are six species of baboon: the hamadryas baboon, the Guinea baboon, the olive baboon, the yellow baboon, the Kinda baboon and the chacma baboon.  Each species is native to one of six areas of Africa and the hamadryas baboon is also native to part of the Arabian Peninsula.

[2023-01-07 01:15:58] <fukkit__> Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.  The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies.  The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living  relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.

[2023-01-07 21:03:49] <%atcolt> that's a good explanation of hypothethis and (scientific) theory, I just mentioned it, because colloquially, a theory is not such a stern thing, and some people like to argue "yeah, but science is all about theories, they don't know sh*t" to create some hostility against scientific progress

[2023-01-07 21:17:07] <VoidBeem> one thing i think of on the regular, time is relative and the faster you move the quicker through time you move, so if we was to discover faster than light travel one second for the moving object would be so much faster for anything outside of it that it'd be like time travelling into the future
