[2023-01-04 02:01:42] <drinkiess> Last week I saw PROD while in line at the bank. He was wearing 13 rolexes and a chain made out of protein powder so I asked how he had so much money. He said "WATCH THIS", pulled out a Sheriff and robbed the bank for $500. Then he double updrafted and dashed out of the store...
