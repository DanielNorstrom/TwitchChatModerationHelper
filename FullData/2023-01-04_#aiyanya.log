[2023-01-04 11:02:36] <%+Vexingcon> The thing that bugged me about GW2 was the living story, if I fell off the game for a while and came back later you really felt like you missed something.

[2023-01-04 12:35:58] <!%dyseal> cause dailies otherwise are worth like 2g/day, but you can easily get 5+ in open world

[2023-01-04 12:37:54] <+aptrist> HoT really specialises in big metas, PoF specialises in bounties and EoD well uhhh
[2023-01-04 12:38:08] <!%dyseal> RIBA trains were always heaps of fun and an easy xp grind for my crystals
[2023-01-04 12:38:26] <%+Shaka1660> @Shaka1660 im thinking octovine and dragon stand
[2023-01-04 12:38:27] <Snowwraith> I think they realised they overdid it with HoT so they eased back on Event Maps so PoF onwards is more a mix.
[2023-01-04 12:38:34] <!%nameinusage> Btw aiya did the throne arrive?
