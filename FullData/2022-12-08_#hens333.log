[2022-12-08 14:37:03] <sam_vilderness> slowdown perks will always be strong no ?

[2022-12-08 14:37:10] <TheNzDemon> I think the maps need to be better, alot of them are so good sorry for survivor

[2022-12-08 14:37:21] <%vladka_234> Yeah now i understand Ana, cause i was just asking cause i have a feeling i am not getting that advent calendar bonuses when you logg yourself, but maybe i am not paying attention @Ana1661
[2022-12-08 14:37:23] <+charlesburg04313> maps like this and garden make slowdown a necessity
[2022-12-08 14:37:26] <ChristopherMino> the maps are pretty much so uneven.

[2022-12-08 14:38:13] <sam_vilderness> makes sense actually if u put it that way
[2022-12-08 14:38:18] <+charlesburg04313> if you nerfed slowdown perks wouldnt map balancing become a more prevalent issue
[2022-12-08 14:38:22] <sam_vilderness> nerf them to the ground ?
[2022-12-08 14:38:24] <ChristopherMino> but what would they do to offset those nerfs? As I feel like slowdown perks are the reason BHVR got their "killrate" goal fulfilled
[2022-12-08 14:38:32] <@%Ana1661> @vladka_234 You might not be paying attention ig (because I don't as well but yesterday I had 75 BPs so I noticed after I suddenly had more), you also receive them only after normal bhvr time (5 PM CET)
[2022-12-08 14:38:39] <%MrRyanFish> NGL I feel like the game would be better with no gen perks on either side, and no tool boxes
[2022-12-08 14:38:49] <X3n0verse> @charlesburg04313 that would be healthier to the game than solving the issues with slowdown perks

[2022-12-08 14:53:00] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 Could be in the style of a skill check as a warning

Now it it procced 0.5-1 seconds after a down it would be attention-based which I personally think is way nicer

[2022-12-08 15:05:16] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 ?? 0.5 seconds is the same as DH time, and people learnt that in no time, 1 second is way too much time to let go before it goes boom, basically useless at that point

[2022-12-08 15:05:42] <+w_r_b98> @ana1661 do you think their should be a time limit for eruption if it hasn’t be used in a while? Like a specific time limit on each gen kicked like an active flashbang not being used?

[2022-12-08 15:05:54] <@%Ana1661> @MrRyanFish My reasoning behind 1 second is ping issues, but yeah it could be 0.5

[2022-12-08 15:06:49] <@%Ana1661> @w_r_b98 I think Eruption would've been in a good spot if you had more counterplay to when it procs personally
[2022-12-08 15:06:50] <%eviedudette> @foxtheunicorn hi! hensHi
[2022-12-08 15:06:57] <ponce190610> @Hens333 Where can i fiind any guide or reference of the clock system you use on maps?
[2022-12-08 15:07:00] <%cadxl> @w_r_b98 This is a cool idea. Call of brine is 60 seconds, dragons grip has a window. Eruption existing forever is a little odd
[2022-12-08 15:07:01] <%mary_6559> object of obsesion doesn't work when you're in snowman right?
[2022-12-08 15:07:04] <cee____cee> omg is this the same vittorio
[2022-12-08 15:07:07] <+suharos> @w_r_b98 It's sounds healthy
[2022-12-08 15:07:08] <%ClussyHonks> because of "toxic genrushers" i would assume
[2022-12-08 15:07:12] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 Like the gen could already have a glowing colour to it so you're already aware of Eruption, then it glows brighter from a dull red to a bright orange in 0.5 seconds making it super easy to notice

[2022-12-08 15:09:29] <%+BarelyLive> @Ana1661 Yeah that's too much work, they would need art teams to work on gens and gen appearance coded into the game. It's easier just to delay or make a status effect come up on your screen like "You're about to be erupted"

[2022-12-08 15:15:22] <%+BarelyLive> Should gen speed be related to the number of gens / players left? Like a ratio? For instance, 5 gens means each gen takes lets say 100s then at 4 gens each gen takes 90s etc etc

[2022-12-08 15:18:01] <Gaunter__O__Dimm__> Nope. If you remove all slowdowns and add 10 sec all b tier killer ll be just unplayable vs 4 man swf with 4 medkits.
[2022-12-08 15:18:10] <%+BarelyLive> killer disparity + map differences and how bad RNG can be sometimes
[2022-12-08 15:18:15] <iamstrixy> i had also an idea of perk points. Like u get 8 points to use, strongest perks are 3 points, mid perk 2 and weak 1.

[2022-12-08 15:27:51] <%+BarelyLive> I had a separate rework idea for Nurse, I would like to know what you think. Nurse gets a total of X blinks per game, when she has run out of blinks she is 115 M1 killer. She stays 95 or whatever it is while she has some blinks left. It rewards people for juking them and makes blinks high risk high reward?
[2022-12-08 15:27:52] <0rochimarusnake> and the think is she can still win this if your team is not to good Sadge

[2022-12-08 15:56:09] <KniferX> @Tollerwolf Being a streamer on stream helps cause he can just highlight the match and use it as a topic of conversation on his stream so yeah.
[2022-12-08 15:56:35] <KniferX> "Hey guys just the other day I had this crazy 1 hour long Knight match" etc

[2022-12-08 16:34:45] <@%$Soulaires_> I feel like bhvr should soft rework sadako to make condemn more viable so that she can be played in a unique manner, but also make it more interactive
[2022-12-08 16:34:48] <zarinamain> i cant connect to servers
[2022-12-08 16:34:51] <%sosdbd> @Hens333 how are you doing? how are the games?
[2022-12-08 16:35:13] <%+Scike_> @comic_sansss fair, I'd say condemn sadako is actually more boring tho- at least when you get mori'd by michael you can go next. The Sadako game is probably gonna be 2 mins of slugging before you even get condemned hahah

[2022-12-08 16:37:38] <comic_sansss> @JMan_Zx its close to christmas so i have a suspicion that they have no idea xD
[2022-12-08 16:37:45] <comic_sansss> or they wont care to fix it
[2022-12-08 16:37:46] <@%$Soulaires_> Yeah this patch has broken so much
[2022-12-08 16:37:49] <%+JMan_Zx> The bug report thread for the incentive is around ~15ish reports I last checked

[2022-12-08 16:49:24] <ragan8888> removing hug tech isnt an if lol... its definitely on the chopping block
[2022-12-08 16:49:28] <%Clemsey> it would be strictly bump logic then
[2022-12-08 16:49:30] <@%Ana1661> Is it even possible to remove hug tech?
[2022-12-08 16:49:43] <@%$Soulaires_> It absolutely is on the chopping block they just don’t know how
[2022-12-08 16:49:44] <official_nebulaa> If hug tech was gone id cry
[2022-12-08 16:49:44] <comic_sansss> disable hug tech and nerf op addons and blight will be fun to go against

[2022-12-08 16:49:58] <comic_sansss> @TheKatSidhe same
[2022-12-08 16:50:00] <+JoeJoeLive> at this point the hug tech is not easy to fix thus it's just working as intended for now
[2022-12-08 16:50:01] <@%$Soulaires_> The community managers of bhvr confirmed it ages ago, that it’s unintended and will be removed, but they probably don’t know exactly what to do to fix it

[2022-12-08 16:50:58] <beereyy> @ragan8888 might aswell play nurse at that point

[2022-12-08 16:51:48] <@%$Soulaires_> @joejoelive trust me, I know how their communications work—she was certain of it. She doesn’t make statements like that without information from the team
[2022-12-08 16:51:57] <official_nebulaa> Make blight 100  and survs 90 KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:51:58] <%+JMan_Zx> I wish the geometry of the bump is more normalized, and then the speed of the power is nerfed accordingly
[2022-12-08 16:51:59] <comic_sansss> now that i got much better with billy i tried his 110 addon and idk why its not his most used.  his chainsaw get so fast.

[2022-12-08 16:52:19] <%+noboolipls> I think blight being a 110 killer makes more sense if hug tech is still in the game

[2022-12-08 17:40:48] <%+JMan_Zx> killers hated it because it's just free health state

[2022-12-08 17:41:00] <MiceMan392> @coockyyyyy people hated it so they got rid of that
[2022-12-08 17:41:15] <%+JMan_Zx> honestly, if the snowman hides TR now, that seems a bit killer sided
[2022-12-08 17:41:17] <avoiding_lol> @BerndtJK Definitely a hacker
[2022-12-08 17:41:19] <Gaunter__O__Dimm__> This is good build for Wesker
[2022-12-08 17:41:20] <coockyyyyy> @coockyyyyy wow kinda useless now
[2022-12-08 17:41:40] <%+JMan_Zx> they should have either kept free health state and hide TR, or no free health and no hiding TR
[2022-12-08 17:41:46] <@%Ana1661> How much time passed since Vittorio release?
[2022-12-08 17:41:51] <MiceMan392> @JMan_Zx its just a silly event that will last like 3 weeks max, I think balance is not to big of a deal
[2022-12-08 17:41:54] <thetwinsmain> @berndtjk only way that's possible in A. cheating B. play 24/7

[2022-12-08 17:42:35] <%$JusticeZERO> how much bp**
[2022-12-08 17:42:35] <%knifola> @JusticeZERO id just guess a few hundred mil bp
[2022-12-08 17:42:45] <%+JMan_Zx> @JMan_Zx Yeah for sure, but i think end of last year everyone got annoyed, because survivors still could have gone full sweaty, and killers all found the free health state annoying to play against
[2022-12-08 17:42:51] <thetwinsmain> @justicezero I think at least more then 100 million
[2022-12-08 17:42:58] <avoiding_lol> Yeah its just a meme on doc, wesker is a lot better at these meme builds

[2022-12-08 17:43:14] <gunzes60> @JusticeZERO from 0 to 100 it takes about 80 mil to 120 mil

[2022-12-08 17:43:22] <%$JusticeZERO> nice, thanks all
[2022-12-08 17:43:23] <OminousGarou> Also need sloppy for this build, or its useless. Sloppy makes it even longer and if you miss skill check you lose progress
[2022-12-08 17:43:24] <gunzes60> variates from type to type
[2022-12-08 17:43:25] <+DyRrZie01> @Hens333 how is the event so far ?
[2022-12-08 17:43:26] <avoiding_lol> I did a skillcheck build on legion once and it went alright, could see killer instinct from miles away

[2022-12-08 17:43:40] <KILkoBear> if you send yourself to indoors maps with this build u dont need two calm addons at all
[2022-12-08 17:44:09] <shacrosis> i still don't get why wesker has that massive terror radius .... if anything doc should be the only killer with a super terror radius
[2022-12-08 17:44:26] <%cadxl> Sloppy and spamming tier 3 madness might actually be slower healing overall

[2022-12-08 17:46:47] <turbek10> do u need double calm for this build at all ? Hmmm
[2022-12-08 17:46:49] <%$JusticeZERO> @avoiding_lol id say attempt to relax, youve done all you can do, just relax and try your best
[2022-12-08 17:47:06] <gunzes60> @shacrosis massive terror radius means more disadvantage to killer, so its maybe how they tried to balance him
[2022-12-08 17:47:12] <%knifola> the "have your guards get 5 hits" is such an annoying daily
[2022-12-08 17:47:13] <@%Ana1661> @BerndtJK Fastest first P100 was achieved by unlikeableAB in 2 weeks 6 days iirc. It's been 2 weeks 2 days since Vittorio release. I guess it could be technically possible if you grind even more than AB
[2022-12-08 17:47:22] <%+JMan_Zx> @cadxl i came here after stumbling on hens' 3 gen strat, I don't think i can ever feel joy when i see knightn ow

[2022-12-08 18:39:23] <%+JMan_Zx> should have just made it pure cosmetic if they didn't want balance issues
[2022-12-08 18:39:24] <DweetZeppelin> 🤡
[2022-12-08 18:39:27] <+lumiinoous> i prefer the unstable rifts from halloween, it felt really fun to gain haste
[2022-12-08 18:39:27] <%EvilD34d> that was part of the fun to get an extra health state inside snowmen
[2022-12-08 18:39:33] <%+TheArctosJackal> I just like that killers can now go in
[2022-12-08 18:39:39] <+lumiinoous> wasnt last years event just snowmen too
[2022-12-08 18:39:53] <%+JMan_Zx> that's i'm saying, survivors and killers should both be incentivized to enter snowman
[2022-12-08 18:40:01] <%+JMan_Zx> that way you can have funny shennanigan mindgames
[2022-12-08 18:40:03] <@%Ana1661> @lumiinoous Yeah but they were giving you "an extra" health state
[2022-12-08 18:40:19] <@%Ana1661> And you gained cosmetics by escaping in a snowman which was funny
[2022-12-08 18:40:28] <%+JMan_Zx> like 5 snowman sitting together trying to find out who's the killer
[2022-12-08 18:40:35] <desolatingvision> @JMan_Zx yeah well idk, it could be used for bubba instead of insidiouts

[2022-12-08 18:45:51] <ZoopDoop_Games> mid B
[2022-12-08 18:45:56] <%+TheArctosJackal> Me personally like Low B

[2022-12-08 18:46:05] <%EvilD34d> @nathan12670_ that is weird then, i thought maybe you had prayer tablet (puke cant affect survivors directly).

[2022-12-08 18:46:11] <%+mig_rattlehead> fr probably c or high b

[2022-12-08 18:46:22] <+lumiinoous> bubba is better than all the killers, blight and nurse are so bad compared to bubba
[2022-12-08 18:46:32] <desolatingvision> legion would be op
[2022-12-08 18:46:33] <%+TheArctosJackal> That would be so wild
[2022-12-08 18:46:33] <Lockon_TV> they would put every killer at S+
[2022-12-08 18:46:42] <%+JMan_Zx> speaking as new player: wraith
[2022-12-08 18:46:42] <%cadxl> His eyes are number one. His muscles are number one. His chainsaw is number one. Booba is number one.
[2022-12-08 18:46:43] <DwightedBlight> they wouldn't know what to say about twins

[2022-12-08 18:46:55] <@%Ana1661> You gave me an idea now I will ask my little brother KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:47:03] <brainwasher13> in 50h they dont even met every killer
[2022-12-08 18:47:12] <desolatingvision> @Ana1661 no dont show him this game, its 18+
[2022-12-08 18:47:16] <%+mig_rattlehead> I remember the first times I played wraith, I thought just the cloaking was so busted
[2022-12-08 18:47:17] <DylanDvsn> I find Wraith and Legion the hardest to go against
[2022-12-08 18:47:25] <+nerdypoptart420> When I started I thought nurse was op… still do
[2022-12-08 18:47:27] <@%Ana1661> @desolatingvision He's playing it with me bro
[2022-12-08 18:47:31] <%Kapalina> tbf every unusual killer just slays in low enough elo, since people dont even know what he/ she does
[2022-12-08 18:47:32] <+RezedentSleeper> plague is op
[2022-12-08 18:47:33] <desolatingvision> ;(\
[2022-12-08 18:47:40] <grumblephant> The only honest killer to me is Huntress.
[2022-12-08 18:47:41] <aurhh> whos a good killer to farm bp ?
[2022-12-08 18:47:43] <Demented_Hag> wraith and huntress are op

[2022-12-08 18:49:19] <nathan12670_> I was playing a custom a couple days ago and this guy was bragging how many hours he had and how good he was with huntress, after his game I switched to huntress and obliterated the team and he was blaming everyone he could and the ping while he was host. I was just like “skill issue clearly”
[2022-12-08 18:49:20] <%Kapalina> @DarthGryffon imagine killing a killer with head on after decisive KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:49:21] <Kasey_tea> Pig is just a scary beast for new players. A combination of stealth and slow down built in is a nightmare for inexperienced players.

[2022-12-08 18:50:55] <Kasey_tea> @Hens333 I think it's just more common for new players to hide. Billy has a disadvantage because he makes so much noise. A stealth killers are the few that can get close to new players without them hiding.

[2022-12-08 19:53:28] <@%Ana1661> @lumiinoous I mean yeah, but it's not like it's p2w, you don't have to buy them, idk I personally don't mind that you can access winter-themed cosmetics only during winter
