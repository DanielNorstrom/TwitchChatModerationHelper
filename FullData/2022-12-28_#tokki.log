[2022-12-28 01:50:23] <@%^Nightbot> The Twitch shirt you see Tokki wearing she got directly from the Dev team. The Devs randomly lurk around DBD streams and give the shirt out based on their discretion. Things they take into consideration: streaming the game consistently, retaining a strong concurrent viewership, and having a growing following! It's because of YOU guys Tokki was able to get it! tokkiHug For additional details, see deadbydaylight.com/news/twitch-tshirt-update

[2022-12-28 02:32:52] <%kristengracelee> It's because the payment has to get routed through another party, whereas Twitch can handle that directly via the web

[2022-12-28 02:58:02] <KermitFTW2> Its also a good choice
[2022-12-28 02:58:14] <%bigchase39> Yeah, I think that's a good challenge. I think take fearmonger off and use lethal to get the jump
[2022-12-28 02:58:25] <mr_mtv69> how are the games going
[2022-12-28 02:58:26] <!%emilee_mentos> what is it exactly?
[2022-12-28 02:58:55] <thrillerrr_> the way i got it done was just playing normally! try the green add on that refills your power after breaking a pallet or wall
[2022-12-28 02:58:59] <KermitFTW2> I did it one survivor at a time
[2022-12-28 02:59:20] <%$the_crimson_smile> Marking doesn't mean down them
[2022-12-28 02:59:31] <%bigchase39> @Tokki Right, but if you want to 99 everyone for the fun of that then corrupt will help

[2022-12-28 03:01:11] <%bigchase39> So, are you wanting to have everyone marked at the same time or just get the 4 marks separately?
