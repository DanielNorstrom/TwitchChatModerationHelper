[2022-12-29 01:05:59] <LordZs0m> Hi @flats , I got a hot take, if ow2 would reduce healing that would make support gameplay more enjoyable as then, there is less incentive to dive them, and also makes the cost of going for a play a big anti nade/going for pick decrease in terms of team value (as overall healing is lower). This change might cause a problem in game pacs or in the life of tanks. But I might be completely wrong. What do you think?

[2022-12-29 01:21:33] <superguest80> You could probably make Hook a charge like Doomfist's punch, increasing the range and damage of the hook, and that makes it possible to remove power from the gun while rewarding more skilled Roadhog players.

[2022-12-29 01:26:53] <%its_mrriceguy> @chxinedl One, at no point was he ever mean. Being direct is just a thing adults do rather than beat around a question in an attempt to make people feel special. Two, he doesn't owe anyone in the chat a answer to anything. If you want to donate, that great, but it doesn't entitle you or anyone else to special treatment.

You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory

[2022-12-29 03:49:48] <%Hotrodzman> Played 1 game as yeti won and decided never again
[2022-12-29 03:49:50] <%Violet_Ashes> Took RaptorGod 30 games before he got one game of Yeti
[2022-12-29 03:49:51] <$iTzzTinny> You get what you get and you dont get upset
[2022-12-29 03:49:52] <%+puleaze> the more you play Mei the higher your chance of getting Yeti when you queue it
[2022-12-29 03:49:53] <%+markus_the_legend> need enough peep to prefer mei
[2022-12-29 03:49:55] <DarqPhoenix> actually getting the yeti is the hard part NODDERS in game you just have to stay away from the meis until you're ready to bop them

[2022-12-29 03:49:57] <Infochann> Ive gotten yeti everytime I queued for it

You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[2022-12-29 03:50:09] <juggax> should just be quaranteed
[2022-12-29 03:50:09] <%xoCakepop> its only hard if you keep leaving games bc you don't get yeti, it lowers your chance.
[2022-12-29 03:50:12] <duckman699> they are rats when ur ulting
[2022-12-29 03:50:12] <usurpura> In my experience who wins depends entirely on if a mei throws

[2022-12-29 21:59:33] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-29 22:16:05] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-29 22:18:06] <%SaraB2> @Flats I already said this but I didn't @ you and chat was going real fast, so... Those shirts can be bought in bulk, so it could be argued that it is, in fact, the same shirt, while also, at the same time, it is NOT the same shirt
[2022-12-29 22:18:07] <%+atsBrew> !name
[2022-12-29 22:18:07] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-29 22:33:45] <%audka> maybe it’s bc I don’t play other competitive games but hero bans just sounds like a bad time to me
[2022-12-29 22:33:47] <bogeneisdrachen> Mei feels better to fight against compared to OW1

[2022-12-29 22:33:55] <%+ALEXEATSOREOS> I don't think mei is broken, but she's really unfun to play against for me in my metal lobbies. I generally don't like slows

[2022-12-29 22:34:08] <+ItsJustTony0> let's do role bans instead, where each team bans an entire role from the match :)

[2022-12-29 22:34:22] <hoax_0_0> knowing blizzard they would prob mistake hero banning and bring back hero pools
[2022-12-29 22:34:28] <%jnics23> I've been enjoying orisa cause I'm worried they will revert her when hog gets hit
[2022-12-29 22:34:35] <talon824> @pandamension Circuit Royale is Maximilien’s Casino.
[2022-12-29 22:34:36] <brotherd3nnis> @flats do you think they need to change mercy then?
[2022-12-29 22:34:37] <infinite_sinnerx> who's ur favourite hero of each class?
[2022-12-29 22:34:37] <%SaraB2> UGH I HATE THIS I'm in so much pain & I don't know whyyyyyyyy... it's too much for my normal dose of pain meds to manage...
[2022-12-29 22:34:38] <$BrainyLucario> I forgot about pools tbh
[2022-12-29 22:34:38] <%KevinKalani> A Nano Orisa can be pretty scary
[2022-12-29 22:34:39] <lzimmlive> Hero pools?
[2022-12-29 22:34:40] <coffeetoons> @hoax_0_0 I put my bets on hog
[2022-12-29 22:34:42] <Klyts> @Flats did you finally convert to ESDF or are you still not convinced ? LUL
[2022-12-29 22:34:43] <zachscoots69420> ITS HIGH NOON
[2022-12-29 22:34:44] <+ekkar1> a pocketed DPS with mercy is actually destroying my lobbies in like gold-ish area
[2022-12-29 22:34:50] <+Spluge_Mcduck> i still believe that if hog's hook range was lower he would be fine the way he is otherwise
[2022-12-29 22:34:53] <zachscoots69420> Ult
[2022-12-29 22:34:54] <@%chompchomp8> like nobody does enough damage to kill pocketed dps except heroes with one shots and junkrate LUL
[2022-12-29 22:34:56] <+klonDICE> so if they nerf pocketed DPS impact, do you think that would reduce hog usage?
[2022-12-29 22:35:00] <ItsSuperGalactic> dont nerf mercy pls
[2022-12-29 22:35:01] <%thedogbeard> I think I got banned
[2022-12-29 22:35:01] <composedmage> flats from valorant?

[2022-12-29 22:35:06] <lemonxheadx> Do you think Mei is weak? @Flats if so what should they give her?
[2022-12-29 22:35:10] <%thedogbeard> overwatch won't let me log in
[2022-12-29 22:35:10] <coto616> i like nano brigs
[2022-12-29 22:35:12] <%+AnxiousDev> nerf mercy damage boost simple
[2022-12-29 22:35:12] <goldenreaper553> the simple awnser is to nerf genji
[2022-12-29 22:35:12] <%xsansthecomic> hi flats! just got off work, happy to catch stream
[2022-12-29 22:35:15] <invisablelightning> @KevinKalani ya but that takes a ult to be scared, ramattra just needs his ability, and hog just needs to be there
[2022-12-29 22:35:16] <Noeliosis> so what youre saying is nerf genji got it NOTED
[2022-12-29 22:35:18] <zachscoots69420> Ult?
[2022-12-29 22:35:18] <%+PaulThaAsian> it makes sense
[2022-12-29 22:35:22] <%+prized_1> Would it be alright if they nuke hog and debuff dps?
[2022-12-29 22:35:22] <%Houdini2812> flatsS
[2022-12-29 22:35:22] <%TacoKnight_> they should make it so hog can just fling people around with his hook
[2022-12-29 22:35:23] <%+pandamension> @talon824 I'm slacking on my lore...I'm just disappointed in myself lol
[2022-12-29 22:35:24] <SuGaR_TI> No please i just want to enjoy playing tank again
[2022-12-29 22:35:24] <+Spluge_Mcduck> hog is the pop valve for too much dps
[2022-12-29 22:35:24] <%Ari0n0s> @lemonxheadx Mei is not weak , she jsut doesnt have a 1 shot
[2022-12-29 22:35:24] <oiKhaled16OW> Did Cyx yell at you or smth Flats?

[2022-12-29 22:38:12] <%$TeaHauss> they can reclassify discord as a cc so it affects tanks less
[2022-12-29 22:38:14] <+sezyks> if they nerf hog one shot, mercy would just boost him back to one shotting
[2022-12-29 22:38:15] <denniixx> imo they need to start buffing the weaker tanks or dps will take over the game
[2022-12-29 22:38:17] <%$TeaHauss> right?

[2022-12-29 22:38:39] <%ow_sigmaeats> @deviilchan__ what
[2022-12-29 22:38:42] <ItsSuperGalactic> @sezyks thats a lot of resources not on your dps then.

[2022-12-29 22:38:43] <@%^StreamElements> eclipz405 just cheered 200 bits flatsH
[2022-12-29 22:38:45] <illusionsatlas> I think the team wants to rework him soon anyways
[2022-12-29 22:38:49] <coffeetoons> streamer guide nice
[2022-12-29 22:38:51] <mafia_151> hi flats
[2022-12-29 22:38:51] <%+xxPanda_17> should hog have the same effect to his hook that genji has to his dash?
[2022-12-29 22:38:51] <composedmage> @flats change discord to see through walls?
[2022-12-29 22:38:52] <%+PaulThaAsian> what would the top 3 nerfs or buffs you'd like to see not specifically
[2022-12-29 22:39:00] <Ghostkirby125> When in doubt. Nerf genji
[2022-12-29 22:39:01] <talon824> Hanzo is in such a weird state. Even without the bug he isn’t amazing, but I also think Storm arrow isn’t healthy in the game with 1 tank, the way it was against double shield or 5 tanks and a Moira.
[2022-12-29 22:39:04] <+ItsJustTony0> are we really at a point where we should talk about nerfing supports?
[2022-12-29 22:39:04] <kevbo01> hey @flats how you doing
[2022-12-29 22:39:05] <$Yidca> What would be your fix for Zen then ?
[2022-12-29 22:39:06] <%TheEmptySkys1> All damage adjustments should be adjusted down imo

[2022-12-29 22:39:12] <VantablackEffect> Have they said anything new about the new brig rework?
[2022-12-29 22:39:13] <mistergeese> Nerf genji
[2022-12-29 22:39:15] <%KevinKalani> @lightningcell4 I actually find support to be the least stressful role for me, for real. But Lucio has always been my best support, and Kiriko just fit with my playstyle I guess. I agree playing any other support probably feels bad
[2022-12-29 22:39:17] <m1ssingno_> i still dont know why they removed 2 tanks tbh
[2022-12-29 22:39:20] <just_a_number00> Discord down to 15%?
[2022-12-29 22:39:20] <TheRealDelajuice> Nerf genji

[2022-12-29 22:40:19] <invisablelightning> @Flats what about moria, does she need changes to make her less op or changes to be more like picked?

[2022-12-29 22:40:24] <talon824> Honestly, most of the roster does too much damage, it was probably too high at ow1, but everyone sucked and couldn’t land it
[2022-12-29 22:40:24] <clam245> Rein too much damage???? Really??
[2022-12-29 22:40:25] <Doot0Lord> hog is just bs and shouldnt be an example
[2022-12-29 22:40:26] <%+PaulThaAsian> I'd LOVE that rein change
[2022-12-29 22:40:28] <ColdKoot> I think it would be cool if they gutted hog's damage and gave him knockbacks and a new cc that nullified movement. make him control space and move around the team in exchange for taking the oneshot
[2022-12-29 22:40:28] <ItsSuperGalactic> @zachscoots69420 its just a joke lol
[2022-12-29 22:40:29] <%Keystone4274> What if discord was an ability that reduces healing received?
[2022-12-29 22:40:29] <%KevinKalani> Rein does too much damage except for Pin. Pin should still be 250 @Flats

[2022-12-29 22:40:51] <eDMGclone> what threatens supports.
[2022-12-29 22:40:52] <CooLitten> I recently figured out that rein is super fun, I just don
[2022-12-29 22:40:53] <%+Thrahx_Vaug> What about buffing his Shield hp? There is no double shield now so maybe not so bad?
[2022-12-29 22:40:54] <%audka> rein and ana doing the same dps is weird but I kinda like it
[2022-12-29 22:40:55] <%+pandamension> he would raise hell in low elo....he wouldn't die in bronze
[2022-12-29 22:40:57] <coffeetoons> not even Lucio can escape the charge
[2022-12-29 22:41:00] <ItsSuperGalactic> doomfist patch was hell for supports
[2022-12-29 22:41:04] <+Spluge_Mcduck> support life is not very much fun right now, unless you play kiriko
[2022-12-29 22:41:07] <+klonDICE> a charging orisa is scary as a support main X_X
[2022-12-29 22:41:07] <zachscoots69420> @itssupergalactic okay thank you. I was like he doesn’t seem like he’s strong really
[2022-12-29 22:41:09] <Fromani> I miss rein meta
[2022-12-29 22:41:10] <invisablelightning> junk too
[2022-12-29 22:41:11] <+Spluge_Mcduck> compared to previous
[2022-12-29 22:41:13] <%xsansthecomic> that's the issue with hog is no matter how much damage you do, he just self heals SO much health and then the additional health from his supports
[2022-12-29 22:41:16] <%paddingtonnnn> you put junk back in there
[2022-12-29 22:41:17] <elysiaaxx> yeah support is really tough
[2022-12-29 22:41:18] <+mirkounbound> going to 75 would break the 250 dmg combo with firestrike tho
[2022-12-29 22:41:19] <clam245> Hanzo lol

[2022-12-29 22:41:35] <invisablelightning> rip tire scares me as a support main "FIRE IN THE HOLE!" me thinks "FUCK IMMMA DIE"
[2022-12-29 22:41:45] <Doot0Lord> would make fights in low ranks last for the whole game tho
[2022-12-29 22:41:46] <ilovehotmoms58> how do I play Winston? I’m a pretty decent tank player, but I only have an hour on Le Monke. Could I get some advice?
[2022-12-29 22:41:47] <TheFluffyEwaff> @mirkounbound so buff up the firestrike a bit
[2022-12-29 22:41:48] <+ItsJustTony0> I just want them to buff DVa so I have a reason to play the game again
[2022-12-29 22:41:48] <%Phoenix_12> would returning Hog back to his OW1 stats help balance him? or is the hook too strong regardless of his survivability.
[2022-12-29 22:41:49] <Luftytwo> are you worried about ttk and fights taking too long?
[2022-12-29 22:41:50] <talon824> @mirkounbound Not if they upped it back to 100 per firestrike
[2022-12-29 22:41:51] <%Angry_Wata> @Flats  moira would be even more badass
[2022-12-29 22:41:52] <coffeetoons> one shots are fun to play with but not against

[2022-12-29 22:42:53] <%KevinKalani> decrease or increase ttk?
[2022-12-29 22:42:54] <%brotherd3nnis> low ttk works for multi-player but not so much for war zone

[2022-12-29 22:42:55] <goldenreaper553> lower ttk does mean that everyone will spend more time waiting for respawn though

[2022-12-29 22:42:57] <+lstratz> I think if we lowered the overall damage all around, it would cause endless fights with the amount of healing in the game
[2022-12-29 22:42:58] <%+pandamension> still waiting for 6v6 in arcade
[2022-12-29 22:43:01] <Doot0Lord> ttk in ow is fine imo just too many high damaging charachters and oneshots
[2022-12-29 22:43:03] <CooLitten> and then nerf genji

[2022-12-29 22:43:06] <mrwang30> Thats what OV1 was. too much ttk
[2022-12-29 22:43:07] <%+TsuraiZangetsu> Dude I was just talking about that with my friends yesterday. Lower the overall damage and healing so that supports can do something other than heal bot
[2022-12-29 22:43:07] <Doot0Lord> @zachscoots69420 yeah heard so

[2022-12-29 22:43:26] <+Spluge_Mcduck> i find switching to 5v5 format makes me not want to play tank at all, because then it's all on me and if I dont make perfect decisions there's nobody else to pick up the slack anymore xD

[2022-12-29 22:43:31] <%+xXSnakeSkinzXx> if you lower overall damage, do we also have to adjust healing so it's not mini goats where no one dies?
[2022-12-29 22:43:32] <%KevinKalani> I think lowering damage too much might make JOATS comeback
[2022-12-29 22:43:33] <%+Hakuna_Mufasa> idk why theyre going for realism in that department. like "hey you know what has a really low TTK? war. and as far as i know everybody loves war!"
[2022-12-29 22:43:33] <uselesskriht> i think if u did that u would also have to lower healing
[2022-12-29 22:43:34] <%$littlenomadoo> to much burst in the meta to many one shots
[2022-12-29 22:43:36] <bugetalucard> I would actually like to see maybe no one shots?

[2022-12-29 22:43:39] <%xsansthecomic> that's the thing if hog does get nerfed to the ground would another tank take his place as op?
[2022-12-29 22:43:39] <%$TeaHauss> @rizz_goat tts is 200 bits
[2022-12-29 22:43:40] <%Angry_Wata> @Flats  with that change you could make a little more mystakesa ans still be alive
[2022-12-29 22:43:42] <%spectreadept> I'm worried fights would drag on for too long if's not done correctly
[2022-12-29 22:43:44] <+ekkar1> increase health by 8x and increase damage by 6x and then everyone feels tanky and shit at the same time
[2022-12-29 22:43:47] <Pseudo_OP> so it should take longer to kill ppl
[2022-12-29 22:43:49] <%ow_sigmaeats> Instead of having a whole roster nerf would be a little bit too boring in my opinion
[2022-12-29 22:43:49] <%TheEmptySkys1> Doing that, I feel like we'd have to lower the overall sustain as well, so a situation doesn't develope where people are living forever
[2022-12-29 22:43:50] <bugetalucard> Like one button press == kill isn’t a thing?

[2022-12-29 22:43:54] <Marcuburton> I think it’s fine
[2022-12-29 22:43:56] <%8endrv8> I agree but if your lowering damage why would you increase reins heath?
[2022-12-29 22:43:57] <talon824> I agree. I hate the moniker of “damage” or “dps” heroes. They shouldn’t be about damage, they should excel at securing elims imho.

[2022-12-29 22:43:58] <%+DjangoMarstolt> A big issue with MWII/WZ2.0 is the TTK is fast combined with the movement speed being gimped outside of jumpshotting around corners.

[2022-12-29 22:45:28] <+lstratz> I feel like this already happens in higher ranks actually.That's why supports get dove so often and why one shots are so strong @Flats
[2022-12-29 22:45:39] <%Ari0n0s> Imo I agree with the lower of damage across the board

[2022-12-29 22:45:52] <Fromani> Low elo wasn’t coordinated enough to fully pull off goats IMO
[2022-12-29 22:45:56] <!%+Scrubbles_Ow> blizzards goal is to also make games faster for people so that'd be not great for that goal

[2022-12-29 22:46:01] <%itsbiggs22> Think about my Bronze 5 ass
[2022-12-29 22:46:01] <talon824> Imho, lowering damage, healing and non-hp defences, making hp differences matter a little more.
[2022-12-29 22:46:05] <%ZoranaFanBoy> if you decrease dmg you have to decrease heals also
[2022-12-29 22:46:08] <%Neranei> scale ttk with rank LuL
[2022-12-29 22:46:08] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Fromani Fact. It wasn't until like high-diamond that Goats even worked.

[2022-12-29 22:46:24] <+benadryllandchill> Reaper healed more than Brig’s inspire that was nuts
[2022-12-29 22:46:32] <%StephaneLevs> balancing for high and low ranks is so hard and complicated

[2022-12-29 22:46:39] <%Jediwinner> Dead my daylight moment
[2022-12-29 22:46:39] <+Spluge_Mcduck> it would allow supports to throw out the supplementary damage needed to kill stuff
[2022-12-29 22:46:44] <+kostinoLoL> Hey flats about lowering ttk: they tried that in LoL and it made early game characters stronger cause the bad early game  characters had basically no damage or no agency for the majority of the game. I think lowering dmg in general would make the value of characters like mercy+hitscan even higher cause they would be the only ones doing stuff
[2022-12-29 22:46:45] <%KevinKalani> @maenaaaaa You're welcome. If you want to see what it looks like, Overwatch league has years of footage on it. It's interesting because it taught everyone the importance of cooldowns and punishing cooldowns

[2022-12-29 23:13:38] <pavecemeny> whats your favorite overwatch skin
[2022-12-29 23:13:39] <arisbiggestfan> You should try final fantasy 14, its more user friendly
[2022-12-29 23:13:41] <Sakitoshi> mmorpg in general aren't n00b friendly
[2022-12-29 23:13:44] <%$benadryllandchill> Those max lvl boosts aren’t cheap either they’re about the same price as OW league skin bundles
[2022-12-29 23:13:45] <+lstratz> that would have been way better
[2022-12-29 23:13:52] <%RedDeathVirus> @Flats to put that into Overwatch perspective, you where bronze 5 and where dropped into a GM 1 game, if you  do ever try it again, go through it slowly on your own
[2022-12-29 23:13:55] <%$TeaHauss> hugghfyhf, when people start following the rules to bronze roasting, is when bronze roasting comes back

[2022-12-29 23:14:40] <+Spluge_Mcduck> honestly I would rather go back to playing Old School Runescape than WoW again.  WoW was a good 5 years of my life though

[2022-12-29 23:15:20] <Sakitoshi> mmorpg throw a million systems at you and you have to learn all of them in order to play, not newbie friendly. t.old ragnarok online player
[2022-12-29 23:15:20] <%+alexye84> I enjoyed WoW until mid Legion. Still try to follow the lore, but as for ever playing it again. Big nope.
[2022-12-29 23:15:20] <%Infinity1337> I hate when people do that - I'll teach you the wow ways
[2022-12-29 23:15:21] <%Tunt_Life> but then again chat will probably spoil everything like they did with subnautica

[2022-12-29 23:15:27] <+playsomethingsaxman> <3 MercyWing1 PinkMercy MercyWing2
[2022-12-29 23:15:29] <+lstratz> yeah if you were to play it again, don't level boost so you can learn how the whole game works. Then later in the game you can get addons and stuff
[2022-12-29 23:15:36] <olivierwafer> ik i was about to say theyre a rlly good mercy
[2022-12-29 23:15:37] <%+atsBrew> @Tunt_Life YEP oh so great
[2022-12-29 23:15:38] <+lstratz> If you really decide you want to
[2022-12-29 23:15:41] <%Thandwar> @Spluge_Mcduck they have t odo a lot of things to even considered going back
[2022-12-29 23:15:53] <%Thandwar> just play FFXIV instead
[2022-12-29 23:15:59] <%modestghost> i hope people say that about my mercy pocket
[2022-12-29 23:16:00] <VantablackEffect> I've been getting into dps recently as a support main. Any tips from anyone? I've enjoyed playing symm and junk mostly
[2022-12-29 23:16:08] <+Spluge_Mcduck> @Spluge_Mcduck to me it just feels like nothing means anything in the MMO scene anymore.  the whole experience is broken
[2022-12-29 23:16:09] <conte_verdi> mercy fan behaving
[2022-12-29 23:16:09] <%StephaneLevs> pocket bob
[2022-12-29 23:16:10] <%+Ninjipp0> Bob, can you do something for me
[2022-12-29 23:16:10] <SSorrens> If you wanted to get into an MMO that doesn't have that bad of a learning curve, FFXIV is pretty good. Only MMO I've ever played & enjoyed.
[2022-12-29 23:16:14] <%ow_sigmaeats> Just see flats playing dark souls 3 and has to face the first boss it’ll be so funny
[2022-12-29 23:16:14] <+Spluge_Mcduck> it should have never been monetized
[2022-12-29 23:16:19] <+GabLo____> theres on screen adds now???

[2022-12-29 23:16:47] <%MADcees> good mercy. i had a mercy pocket me last nigh it was crazy. the rizzz
[2022-12-29 23:16:51] <%RedDeathVirus> i have been watching you play overwatch for years @Flats, i honestly think you would really enjoy it, but maybe not something to stream, just a chillout thing to cool off after OW2 Tilt
[2022-12-29 23:16:52] <%Zulutopiaa> can we all come together and just remove her?
[2022-12-29 23:16:53] <ColdKoot> buying level boost is honestly a shit idea unless you're willing to look up guides or have someone to teach you. thing is, leveling experience is rough if you dont like the story. i cant figure out why they drop you into shadowlands to level instead of bfa or legion. legion leveling is goated
[2022-12-29 23:16:53] <%RadiantPhoenix_> lucio always seems like some guy that just got in over his head

I've started seeing a lot of diamond-masters and even GM players now in my lobbies, (and that seems to be the case for some of my buddies as well) and i seem to still be able to pull my weight in that situation while being mid plat, would that mean im actually getting to that level or is the ranked/matchmaker just THAT borked right now?
