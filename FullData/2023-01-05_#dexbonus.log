[2023-01-05 14:28:05] <%Livingofstories> Or have a small banner that shows what song is playing, seems less intrusive

[2023-01-05 14:29:06] <%+AidanFolkes> content detection is to help the streamer avoid getting sued. If they get reported that can still happen.

[2023-01-05 14:56:21] <RobertusPontifex> the turbines have to offer moderate resistance to the wind to produce energy, so they can get a bit whiny
[2023-01-05 14:56:23] <+Noobcommando> they don´t even have rotors so noisy is not a thing
[2023-01-05 14:56:36] <@%ArnarBjornss> noise is also one thing limiting sea turbines (like taking advantage of the waves). It can have negative effect on marine life like in whales' feeding grounds.

[2023-01-05 14:58:13] <%$Tannah_ONeill> Some wind turbines also kill birds, unless the turbine blades are painted white. from what Ive read.
[2023-01-05 14:58:13] <noratempe> "drum" designs for wind turbines, that rotate around a vertical axis, are also much safer for birds and especially bats while only a bit less efficient

[2023-01-05 14:58:23] <TymenV> Hey @arnarbjornss
[2023-01-05 14:58:26] <+BluCrayons> Yea, it's like roughly 25k to 35k
[2023-01-05 14:58:29] <+Siblin> I still find it insane new builds aren't built with solar already
[2023-01-05 14:58:32] <+BluCrayons> to go entirely solar
[2023-01-05 14:58:38] <+l_Scant_l> what is this 'sunny'?

[2023-01-05 14:58:47] <Nemonal> in NL the gov't subsidized part of the solar panel installation thankfully
[2023-01-05 14:58:49] <ouss1> in France the government help with the upfront cost
[2023-01-05 14:58:49] <%$Tannah_ONeill> Doesn't Tirinei have Solar Panels on her place?
[2023-01-05 14:58:55] <%$Shamalaim> Can't we use the birds slamming into the turbines as a form of energy?
[2023-01-05 14:58:57] <+lordofthecheese> I have a solar system being installed this month, costing me 26k
[2023-01-05 14:59:00] <%+AidanFolkes> there's some debate about wether solar reduces or increases house values

[2023-01-05 14:59:12] <%Tatt3rs> the govt here used to offer grants/subsidies for solar panel installation though am not sure if the new tories kept that up
[2023-01-05 14:59:13] BAN: Tatt3rs (600s)
[2023-01-05 14:59:27] <+Helix919> That may of change in the last few year, we get solar put on our family house and the rebate are covering the cost of installation and the panels
[2023-01-05 14:59:31] <%midwinterlilly> thats about the cost of 3 months electricity here for a large house due to prices are insane atm
[2023-01-05 14:59:33] <+Akkrain> its more affordable to go "solar" now. but without a power bank its not that great a thing. its powerbanks that break the bank now. plus they qualify as hazmat depending on the type
[2023-01-05 14:59:36] <%+DemoOn1337> funny, talking about roof mounted wind turbines... the car I'm standing in front has one on its roof. I assume it's to power the antenna-mechanism sticking out of it? lwlUnsure

[2023-01-05 14:59:40] <RobertusPontifex> state incentives could occasionally be generous for solar place to place but yeah big expense
