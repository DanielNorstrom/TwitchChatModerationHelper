[2022-12-20 06:53:33] <%X3strial> They didn't play test it because they were too busy going back and forth in pre production. It took like 4 years or something just for the game to start being produced
[2022-12-20 06:53:36] <Hadley> this looks very....generic
[2022-12-20 06:53:36] <Spencer_RT> cause EA made all their studios use frostbite since they owned it, so they could get around licensing fees
