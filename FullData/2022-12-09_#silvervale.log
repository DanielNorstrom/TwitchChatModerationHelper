[2022-12-09 09:50:11] <!%SparkWizard> So I think you have to let it slide almost to the end of the conveyor belt to grabbing range and then rewind the belt to make it a jump pad. Then you move it so you can get up (there's a jump between platforms)

[2022-12-09 09:52:01] <%scudrat> i played an awesome side-scrolling puzzle game called Braid...some of that bent my brain
[2022-12-09 09:52:07] <%$Perrin_UI> to be honest, starting from the top never hurt

[2022-12-09 09:52:13] <DelicateFoxy> make it go back and forwards

[2022-12-09 09:52:48] <MarioGrandma> @MarioGrandma dang i hoped
[2022-12-09 09:53:02] <syviper10> So heres my theory: You convert into laser but keep it on the conveyer belt. then you rewind the conveyer belt to convert laser into jump pad to get to door area, then rewind jump pad back into laser?
[2022-12-09 09:53:03] <All_Teo> whait.,..you have infinite seconds with the jumoy pad
[2022-12-09 09:53:11] <%+Mashimaro87> Oh.... the conveyor....maybe I get it? But also maybe not SilverMath

[2022-12-09 09:53:26] <vodkashrimplasagnya> lol
[2022-12-09 09:53:27] <mckrupin> you need to send it through the laser before you turn it into a jump pad
[2022-12-09 09:53:27] <%$Perrin_UI> wait so it becomes a bounce pad, a lazer, AND a box?!

[2022-12-09 12:06:42] <ultragunner5> maybe you could half the jumping pad's distance by using the laser? turning it into a jump pad part way?

[2022-12-09 12:07:29] <DelicateFoxy> you change the laser  into jump pad and then you change it back
[2022-12-09 12:07:35] <@%Raspy_Cobra> Start with your laser on the right side of the room, point at the laser pad, then turn it into a jump and bring it over
[2022-12-09 12:07:36] <DelicateFoxy> so you use both
