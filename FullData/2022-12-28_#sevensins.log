[2022-12-28 12:48:33] <TheRealZoranBlackRose> or a mod that lets you be other party members in town the couple i have found brake the game in certain areas lol

[2022-12-28 12:54:37] <%TidusZecht> it used to be demonsbane

[2022-12-28 12:55:24] <%TidusZecht> the chest in the hidden area you can get to if you kill both walls it's a demonsbane

[2022-12-28 13:06:50] <%GanD988> you right SevenSins , at least for me the gameplay was totally off when i was "young" ( i was 18 ) but for me FF was ATB gameplay and static, not "action". And now after year and saw you playing it it's one of my fav :D
[2022-12-28 13:06:59] <%CynniUniflame> the problem that I had was that my English wasn't good enough back then to fully understand this story. 10 was easier for me to like

[2022-12-28 13:09:30] <%+Toby_1_Kenobi> I remember loving the mechanics in FF12 when I played through it at launch. For some reason, the story didn't leave an impression of wanting to go back to the game later.
[2022-12-28 13:09:36] <%+vxxyman> FF as a series has been innovating since the early days <3

[2022-12-28 13:48:57] <%CynniUniflame> I think Terra is the main char in the first part of FF6. And Celes the main char from the world of ruin on
[2022-12-28 13:49:01] <blakey95uk> that's what my fiancee does to me, shows up and takes my money 😔
[2022-12-28 13:49:05] <%+miralia> ivalice such a great universe with such poor games
[2022-12-28 13:49:09] <%zazu1019> Vaan actually has a decent foundation for a story but doesn't really get and depth beyond that.

[2022-12-28 13:49:17] <@^Nightbot> The Final Fantasy XII jobs have been rolled and decided! Each character can ONLY be this single job: Vaan - White Mage | Penelo - Knight | Balthier - Archer | Fran - Archer | Basch - Archer | Ashe - Uhlan

[2022-12-28 13:50:36] <%+spectr0nn> the fact you keep swapping between parties in FF6 during world of balance says enough right? there's not really a main protag in that sense
[2022-12-28 13:50:37] <blakey95uk> I do agree with basch should've been main character, he has all the background and the heartbreak

[2022-12-28 13:53:06] <%+vxxyman> @spectr0nn That is a fair point I agree with. Although I feel like you can probably make arguments for important characters, etc xD. FFVI is such a great game :)
[2022-12-28 13:53:19] <%Kruggy> I can't say there is a main protag for 6. Different people get focus at different times. Depending on the scene, some characters' moments can leave a bigger impression, like Celes starting in WoR.

[2022-12-28 16:23:06] <%+MrZev> the futher along they get, the harder its going to be.  I dont think Seven even has unlocked the ability to have a 2nd job, so the game difficulty hasnt hit to point where it expects you to have them.
