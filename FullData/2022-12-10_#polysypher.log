[2022-12-10 10:36:39] <@%Serrible> the problem is even if you put in an offering for maps, someone else can bring one and its a 50/50. if you bring a sac ward then theres still no guarantee that youll get a GOOD map.
[2022-12-10 10:37:11] <sevenrings> It was a joke
[2022-12-10 10:37:37] <%youcallmedavid27> i think it would do good for the game if dbd just took a break from releasing new content and actually work on the game itself

[2022-12-10 10:54:17] <PeachyAndYogi> In lots of pain and my brain is still cranking on my last game of DBD last night. Survivors were toxic in game and I merely asked in endgame ''can you maybe not be toxic to a nice killer pls'' and then they hurled abuse at me. Really hard to take when your mental is low and your pain is high.
[2022-12-10 10:54:20] <%mejchar> ok then myers

[2022-12-10 10:57:19] <@%Serrible> instead of having to stalk multiple people, which is more likely, and then get one, maybe 2 downs, you get that individual survivor to a one hit, and dont waste it. with myers you could potentially waste the whole thing on not a single down and each survivor has a limit to how much you can stalk them.
