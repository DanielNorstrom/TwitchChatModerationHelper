[2022-12-26 09:24:25] <%+Destrina> The thing that annoys me the most about how the holocaust is taught is that the millions of non-Jewish people who were killed in it are routinely ignored. Jews definitely got it the worst, but many others died.

[2022-12-26 09:47:46] <%$Stoomie> 47 butt plugs sounds about right, now we just need a water balloon slingshot
[2022-12-26 09:47:56] <$Unweaver> idk. i wouldn't want to have 5 butt plugs and need 6
[2022-12-26 09:47:56] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-26 09:48:19] <%+BubbatheScrub> I don't remember playing this all that much, but I had 6 of the badges when I went to start a new game.
[2022-12-26 09:48:19] <%hottiefruits> sure you don't *need* that many butt plugs, but you *want* that many buttplugs
[2022-12-26 09:48:27] <Boveip> I feel like you can r-click items instead of dragging them?

[2022-12-26 09:50:26] <%+MrZev> ohh this place.  yeah, this is my favorite play to have as my base.

[2022-12-26 09:52:36] <Tewma2> Winter clothes do be heavy though - game's not wrong.
[2022-12-26 09:53:20] <%+BubbatheScrub> The game letting you start with level 3 fires seems broken.

[2022-12-26 09:54:13] <%+MrZev> maybe if you didnt let him starve he would hold more weight
[2022-12-26 09:54:27] <%+BubbatheScrub> The part where it never improves is the strange part.
[2022-12-26 09:54:29] <%EpicPumaNess> he's on a heavy protein diet, working out basically every day, carrying capacity should be on the uprise as long as he's not constantly starving
[2022-12-26 09:54:40] <%+Zmpr0wler> 66 pounds is nothing in packed items
[2022-12-26 09:54:56] <+TheMM42> Mid game of rim world is still my favorite part. Thats why i enjoy the arcotech ending.
[2022-12-26 09:55:03] <%$templarofflame> @Tewma2 they can be heavy, but if he is wearing it it probably shuoldnt ocunt for all the weight against his total
[2022-12-26 09:55:30] <%+BubbatheScrub> I never end up doing endings on RimWorld.

[2022-12-26 09:55:48] <%EpicPumaNess> @Tewma2 I mentioned earlier I think they should only count for like half weight if they're worn cause no one notices the weight of the clothes most of the time anyways
[2022-12-26 09:56:22] <%+MrZev> yeah.  its probably -14 out there.
[2022-12-26 09:56:38] <Iruvatar> like knights running around in 30kg of plate armour
[2022-12-26 09:56:57] <%+BubbatheScrub> 30kg sounds low for full plate.
[2022-12-26 09:57:38] VIEWERS: 952
[2022-12-26 09:57:43] <%EpicPumaNess> just looked it up, its like 25kg ish for plate armor
[2022-12-26 09:57:49] <%+MrZev> or it wasnt mortally wounded
[2022-12-26 09:57:52] <Iruvatar> think thats on the heavier side too

[2022-12-26 09:58:20] <%EpicPumaNess> @Iruvatar yeah, said the range was like 20-25kg, but that since it was evenly spread, it made the wearer still fairly agile
[2022-12-26 09:58:39] <+FlangeNabberTV> @EpicPumaNess is that just the armor, cause they whore several padded layers under it as well usually
[2022-12-26 09:58:46] <%+MrZev> DID YOU FIND IT!?!?!?!
[2022-12-26 09:58:54] <%+MrZev> aww
[2022-12-26 09:58:55] <%+MrZev> fooled me too
[2022-12-26 09:59:06] <Iruvatar> yeah, late medieval period, armour was one of the most perfected "technologies", down to an art
[2022-12-26 09:59:08] <%EpicPumaNess> @EpicPumaNess probably just the armor, but I'd imagine the padding wouldn't be but another 5kg max

[2022-12-26 10:01:14] <Zsindar> @BubbatheScrub jousting plate would be 40-50kg if that is what you are thinking of, that is not battle armor though.
[2022-12-26 10:01:36] <%+MrZev> but no stove... =(

[2022-12-26 10:02:07] <Boveip> @MrZev just need to get out of the wind!
[2022-12-26 10:02:40] <Iruvatar> tell me you can put batteries into the fish on the wall and it sings

[2022-12-26 10:03:56] <%+BubbatheScrub> The batteries probably leaked all over the contacts and ruined them.
[2022-12-26 10:04:00] <dingo2345> northern lights waking the wall fish up, that's scary
[2022-12-26 10:04:18] <%+BubbatheScrub> That's what usually happens with those fish, in my experience.
[2022-12-26 10:04:45] <%+MrZev> just imagine waking up with the fish singing when the power has been out for months.
[2022-12-26 10:05:20] <%+BubbatheScrub> outside ammunition. That's... um... it would be worse and be left outside in the heat I guess?
