[2022-12-09 23:36:15] <%+Flamquill> I was wondering if Ascension was a prequel. I didn't want to say too much because I don't follow this game
[2022-12-09 23:36:16] <+ThatFoodGuy> @Momo God of War 1 for sure.
[2022-12-09 23:36:17] <@%Heavyfoot> @momo no this is first chronologically
[2022-12-09 23:36:23] <%ShadowBunnyGod> its in chronological order in terms of story
[2022-12-09 23:36:23] <Solar_Pancake97> release order is best
[2022-12-09 23:36:23] <fumblenuts_> start with god of war 1
[2022-12-09 23:36:24] <Jucobii> ascension is a prequel
[2022-12-09 23:36:26] <%$chakarvartin86> i for sure
[2022-12-09 23:36:27] <ElreanXII> @TheOnlyMeta183 Well maybe. But the story of Ascension takes places before the first GOW of 2006.
[2022-12-09 23:36:27] <%$guid0sarducci> this is the prequel
[2022-12-09 23:36:29] <AhkosMachina> Start with 1
[2022-12-09 23:36:30] <@%Heavyfoot> you're fine
[2022-12-09 23:36:30] <lycan_silas> Ascension is the start as it’s the prequel
[2022-12-09 23:36:35] <kaiser_august> Watch the first one - Dream On!

[2022-12-09 23:36:40] <%Vakiiri> This is first chronologically, I think Guido put it in the cockpit chat as well NODDERS
[2022-12-09 23:36:43] <%crafty279> this game is 7th in the series, but the prequel
[2022-12-09 23:36:43] <impiledhades> Makes little sense out of context.

[2022-12-09 23:36:48] <%ShadowBunnyGod> yes
[2022-12-09 23:36:49] <@%Heavyfoot> I mean it was in game
[2022-12-09 23:36:51] <ElreanXII> So it is being edited in before the cutscenes of GOW 2006
[2022-12-09 23:36:51] <%ZorroCrusader> its blurred so its fine
[2022-12-09 23:36:51] <AhkosMachina> Since it’s blurred it’s fine
