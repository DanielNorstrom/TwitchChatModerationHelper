[2023-01-04 01:58:12] <+RaZor92P> @samiam1616 I find the goofier moments to be endearing, especially anything around Zack. But all the stuff that tries to be serious and all of Genesis is just painful.
[2023-01-04 01:58:17] <%BeeKaay> i'm a little jealous of people who experience the remakes in order as their first playthroughs
[2023-01-04 01:58:19] <kernelcap> It's easy to see who has or hasn't played the original and who's running off media osmosis

[2023-01-04 03:04:13] <+Mario1080p> to put it simply, OG Zack sounds like Teen Titans Robin on some scenes
[2023-01-04 03:04:13] <%czzm275> :)

[2023-01-04 03:04:16] <samiam1616> I mean 7 came first
[2023-01-04 03:04:17] <justabot9696> tifa and cloud always
[2023-01-04 03:04:17] <Blastom> cloud x barret
[2023-01-04 03:04:19] <RotheHalsley> Well he ded, so she on the market
[2023-01-04 03:04:20] <TopQuark42> I mean the ship solves itself ngl
[2023-01-04 03:04:21] <dinnydanny777> Aerith is never really into Cloud
[2023-01-04 03:04:22] <samiam1616> but yeah it's weird

[2023-01-04 03:04:23] <+TOOMUCHDOG_102> @Moondoggie25 KINDA WHAT
[2023-01-04 03:04:23] <melondesk> it makes more sense for cloud to go with tifa
[2023-01-04 03:04:23] <%$johnathanjoester> I ship cloud and barret
[2023-01-04 03:04:24] <+angel_chelsi> FF7 sis come first
[2023-01-04 03:04:25] <%$Camlen23> aerti or bust limesD
[2023-01-04 03:04:26] <$MasterIckolas> @Limealicious Original FF7 and FF7Remake are...NOT the same for an important reason...
[2023-01-04 03:04:26] <%+Elucet> Zach is just a better Cloud
[2023-01-04 03:04:26] <!%Laimubot> people are making, tell Mike to help take care limesHi
[2023-01-04 03:04:27] <verajonson> because cloud and aerith are shippable
[2023-01-04 03:04:27] <official_pig_wrestler> @Limealicious cloud and aries happeneded  first from my perspective
[2023-01-04 03:04:28] <%SG_Dave_> Cos Zack told Cloud to embrace his girlfriend
[2023-01-04 03:04:28] <TastySammiches> cloud/barret is the only way
[2023-01-04 03:04:29] <%Kalmquat> Those people didn't pay attention to the story lol
[2023-01-04 03:04:30] <KekPek_> cloud x barret
[2023-01-04 03:04:31] <%FrankRTWiw> I don't know very much about ti.
[2023-01-04 03:04:31] <%TrueBlueRevue> So I bet that new FF7 Remake game is going to be all about this game and "rewriting" it with those plot ghosts
[2023-01-04 03:04:31] <%perfectvelvet> they are cute too limesSob
[2023-01-04 03:04:36] <%$E_pam> what, do you want aerith to stay alone forever?

[2023-01-04 03:04:48] <%NikkuMK2> pretty much
[2023-01-04 03:04:49] <%XionBarzhad> Cloud in FF7 has no memory of Zack.

[2023-01-04 03:04:57] <RAlfian5> a lot of his pose and body language too
[2023-01-04 03:04:57] <%$johnathanjoester> he was using the duckstation emulator to load the Zack iso file
[2023-01-04 03:05:01] <%Grin_42> zack didn't exist in the original at all iirc
[2023-01-04 03:05:03] <%Fake_Strange> Cloud doesn't forget about Zach, Cloud forgets about Cloud
[2023-01-04 03:05:04] <DieselLemon> this guy fell fro m the sky just like zach
[2023-01-04 03:05:05] <%Lorothol> limesDance
[2023-01-04 03:05:07] <%dropkickchannel> in the original aerith tells cloud "i want to meet the real you" because she knows he's just serving as a replacement for zack to her
[2023-01-04 03:05:10] <Redvc> He basically absorbed Zack when he died
[2023-01-04 03:05:10] <+izbahn> @Limealicious kinda that, kinda planet poison forced cloud to download zacks memories and give him brain damage
[2023-01-04 03:05:10] <%+cattice> Cloud is his own original character. Did not steal
[2023-01-04 03:05:12] <%LinkyWink> These credits look kinda weird

[2023-01-04 21:41:18] <mammles> The steam version is more bugged, that is for sure. lol
[2023-01-04 21:41:24] <+Carte422> is that because the default history is only 100 instead of 250
[2023-01-04 21:41:26] <%BestyVT> @derap41 I think that effects legendary beasts but not forgotten ones
[2023-01-04 21:41:28] <itsducklan> doesn't steam version also end history earlier as well? so less forgotten beasts are killed off

[2023-01-04 22:15:44] <+Carte422> You can certainly try
[2023-01-04 22:15:44] <%Xifihas> Adamantine makes for great swords and plate armour. Awful for maces and hammers.
[2023-01-04 22:15:45] <%AqueousAblution> @ThePooba "Uthg√∫r" means demon, and "lumen" means jester
[2023-01-04 22:15:49] <Putnam3145> also it's perfectly rigid, which is weird
[2023-01-04 22:15:55] <%$peekas0> Adamantine's not as good against blunt I think, though.
[2023-01-04 22:16:01] <Putnam3145> it's just as good against blunt

[2023-01-04 22:16:16] <Putnam3145> just blunt tends to get through armor easier in general
[2023-01-04 22:16:19] <%$ThePooba> @peekas0 its not AS good as blunt i think, cus its light

[2023-01-04 23:06:12] <Granitier> @Limealicious I recommend regenerating the map, howver go to more settings, on the top left there is a drop down menu saying large island, go to large region
[2023-01-04 23:06:13] <+tmprd> you can increase minimum volcanoes in advanced params, ezpz
[2023-01-04 23:06:14] <%+astrosteve> I'd try a large world and you'd have a better chance of a volcano showing on the mainland

[2023-01-04 23:06:25] <+Carte422> don't try a large world if you value your fps
[2023-01-04 23:06:25] <@%Greygull> just set it so that it generates 69 volcanoes

[2023-01-04 23:07:05] <Putnam3145> if it's a very large world with a lot of sites i've dropped below 100 though
[2023-01-04 23:07:06] <+tmprd> large world only impacts how long saves and loads take, embark size impacts framerate
[2023-01-04 23:07:15] <Rohboat64> size of embark matters a lot more for performance but world size is a factor too

[2023-01-04 23:12:49] <%vuckruck> trees give lots of wood so it does not matter if they are sparse.

The spaces between the clasts are generally filled with sand- and clay-size particles. The rock is bound together by a cement that is usually composed of calcite or quartz."
