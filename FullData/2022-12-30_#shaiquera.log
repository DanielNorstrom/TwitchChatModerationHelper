[2022-12-30 10:10:40] <+Gorasu> ESO used to be pretty broken. Zeni refactored its client and server code during 2019-2020 after that it has been much better.

[2022-12-30 10:34:58] <%$RioClete> You're welcome :)
[2022-12-30 10:35:15] <+Gorasu> Old Main quest starts today with Hooded Figure who drags you to Coldharbour, where you escape.

[2022-12-30 10:37:02] <%$RioClete> <gasp!!>  You didn't get your soul back??? omg!

[2022-12-30 10:37:53] <%$RioClete> tsk tsk tsk
[2022-12-30 10:38:10] <+Gorasu> Yeah, well. Quality kind of bounces all over in those old quests, but it is rewarding to play through at least once. Besides you can start Zone stories by finding your way to starting point of the Alliance story.
[2022-12-30 10:38:25] <%$RioClete> no, you don't have your soul until you finish Cold harbor
[2022-12-30 10:39:04] <%$RioClete> you have to beat Molag Bal
[2022-12-30 10:39:23] VIEWERS: 40
[2022-12-30 10:39:31] <%$RioClete> Originally, you start in Cold Harbor. You were killed before you actually start the game.
[2022-12-30 10:39:38] <+Gorasu> Yeah
[2022-12-30 10:40:01] <%$RioClete> they buggered it up, IMHO.
[2022-12-30 10:40:26] <+Gorasu> Yep, in these days you start in Adamantium tower and can select where you start. But that still gives you freedom to do quests in your chosen order.
[2022-12-30 10:40:46] <+Gorasu> So even if you selected High Isle, you are not bound to that content.
[2022-12-30 10:41:03] <+Gorasu> Yep, that is ESO problem. Too much cool stuff to do :D
[2022-12-30 10:41:25] VIEWERS: 44
[2022-12-30 10:41:25] <%$RioClete> I think it's an essential part of the entire questline.
[2022-12-30 10:42:06] <+Gorasu> Yeah it might be good for sanity to pick one zone story and do it :D
[2022-12-30 10:42:21] <%$RioClete> it's cool. You play how you want to. Not trying to force you into it.

[2022-12-30 11:10:09] <+Gorasu> Disguises are sometimes fun to keep. Like gem that turns you as goblin.
[2022-12-30 11:11:16] <+Gorasu> Yeah, in roleplaying activities disguises and outfits are quite useful.

[2022-12-30 11:36:47] <+Gorasu> Shadowfen Zone quest start was from Stormhold. It is pretty typical that zone story starts right off the wayshrine.
