[2022-12-16 09:04:48] <%+cubbywolf> i dont think guys care about shoe size really
[2022-12-16 09:04:49] <%NullSack> the average is between 10.5 - 11.25 inches
[2022-12-16 09:04:52] <+InfiniteZr0> Shoe sizes are pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they're bigger, sometimes they're smaller. Even if they have the same size number.

[2022-12-16 09:05:15] <imori_tw> you are correct
[2022-12-16 09:05:15] <+Sinhammer6> buying shoes is a struggle
[2022-12-16 09:05:18] <+maxstew7> "The barleycorn is an old English unit that equates to 1⁄3 inch (8.47 mm). This is the basis for current UK and North American shoe sizes,"
[2022-12-16 09:05:19] <+InfiniteZr0> That's why people go to the stores and try them on. Cuz no one really knows.
[2022-12-16 09:05:21] <%theredhunterr> Women are vain, that's why women have horseshit sizes like "size 0"

[2022-12-16 09:05:39] <n3rozer8> women shoe sizes are tighter regulated than men shoes sizes i think
[2022-12-16 09:05:44] <%NullSack> In the US womens and mens sizes are just off by 2
[2022-12-16 09:05:46] <stebuci> So my foot is 10 barlycorns?
