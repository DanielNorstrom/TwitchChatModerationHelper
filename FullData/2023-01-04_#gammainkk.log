Gee I wonder.
[2023-01-04 15:19:30] <!HardcorexHunter> There is a level of victim privilege that people try to latch onto for sympathy. Though it can be harmful because people tend to use it for when they have really bad takes that they don't want to be held accountable for and scapegoat it on the disorder making people who have that look worse.

[2023-01-04 15:30:44] <daha8901> until i was recently diagnosed with ADHD i kept attributing all the symptoms to me just being an irresponsible, unreliable dumbass and now im having trouble figuring out a new way of thinking of myself
[2023-01-04 15:30:47] <AtrophyAtomic> i do feel like Doctors gaslight patients when they run out of ideas for what could be wrong with you "you not sick go home"

[2023-01-04 15:31:45] <igigglezz> @atrophyatomic Here‚Äôs your 500$ band aid
[2023-01-04 15:31:46] <Sylariusz> @AtrophyAtomic that is the moment you realize you should stop giving them money
[2023-01-04 15:32:41] <igigglezz> Unless it severely impares you the diagnosis for add or adhd isn‚Äôt really worth it.
[2023-01-04 15:32:53] <%The_Kampfi> im glad i dont have to take meds anymore for my ADHD, but i can tell you, when i tell a story, u will get 3 Sub-Story, a side-Quest, what i had for breakfast and a Rant about some weird Animal, befor you here the end of my story enclaseKEKW

[2023-01-04 15:33:32] <%$kiriosthanatos> "ok these pills will help u with focusing... BUT they give u diarrhoea, so thank THESE pills for that... BUT they give u renal failure, SOOOOooo"
[2023-01-04 15:33:37] <%+Zero_gs> funny thing is i stopped taking my meds for my disabilities cause it turned out rather then helping stop or reduce my semptioms it actually made them far far far worse and gave me severe depression, now that i stopped taking them i am in a much better state but it goes to show that you need to be careful with what they give you
[2023-01-04 15:33:49] <igigglezz> Hmmm you know. Just need a pro to say yea
[2023-01-04 15:33:54] <Murgasmos> Medically prescribed amphetamines really ain't the long term solution doctors have it pegged as
[2023-01-04 15:34:16] <AtrophyAtomic> Usually a quokka will cure my depressiion for a few minutes
[2023-01-04 15:34:31] <igigglezz> Antidepressants give you eating and ED issues.

[2023-01-04 15:36:25] <daha8901> @AtrophyAtomic it distracts you from your depression, thats not what ''cure'' mean
