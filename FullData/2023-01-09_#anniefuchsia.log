[2023-01-09 01:26:25] <%drzaius30> "You cannot travel beyond this point in the demo version " Sadeg
[2023-01-09 01:27:28] <%$Hasan_Lurker> anniesNo PepegaStealth
[2023-01-09 01:44:19] <%JurgenRapp> on ps5? can't find demo on Steam Sadge
[2023-01-09 01:48:25] <%drzaius30> https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_AU/news/forspoken-demo seems so Sadge
[2023-01-09 01:48:33] <%JurgenRapp> mirrors edge with magic
[2023-01-09 01:48:47] <%JurgenRapp> looks really cool
[2023-01-09 01:48:53] <%drzaius30> If it makes you feel better the game is solidly ok
[2023-01-09 01:49:43] <%JurgenRapp> foresi EU it was 79,99€
[2023-01-09 01:49:48] <%drzaius30> movement and combat seem like the best parts
[2023-01-09 01:49:50] <%JurgenRapp> *In
[2023-01-09 01:50:14] <%JurgenRapp> but that is perhaps the new standard price for AAA
[2023-01-09 01:50:16] <%drzaius30> the character dialogue leaves a lot to be desired LUL
[2023-01-09 01:51:14] <%JurgenRapp> I like smooth movement and mirrors edge like gameplay but I have such a backlog so I will probably wait
[2023-01-09 01:51:37] <%JurgenRapp> so many games so little time
[2023-01-09 01:52:54] <%drzaius30> guess its a bit unfair considering the last 2 PS5 games i played was FF7 remake (replaying) and God of war ragnarok which were 10/10
[2023-01-09 01:53:11] <%drzaius30> so this feels a bit janky in comparison
[2023-01-09 01:53:42] <%JurgenRapp> Sadeg regnarrok looks really good
[2023-01-09 01:54:25] <%drzaius30> It was great near perfect except the characters spoiling the puzzles to early
[2023-01-09 01:54:56] <%JurgenRapp> designers are afraid that the players won't have the patience to figure it out themselves?
[2023-01-09 01:55:08] <%drzaius30> pretty much
[2023-01-09 01:55:46] <%JurgenRapp> yeah hate that and also if they make something easier if you have to try it a couple of times
[2023-01-09 01:55:48] <%drzaius30> should have had an option to turn it off
[2023-01-09 01:56:00] <%JurgenRapp> NODDERS
[2023-01-09 01:56:00] <@%^Nightbot> NODDERS
[2023-01-09 01:56:40] <%drzaius30> @JurgenRapp The main thing is still combat and story which were solid
[2023-01-09 01:57:06] <%drzaius30> Game is also beautiful and music was fantastic
[2023-01-09 01:57:53] <%JurgenRapp> Yeah the ps5 games look really good
[2023-01-09 01:59:24] <%drzaius30> you level up spellcraft by assigning challenges oh no
[2023-01-09 02:00:20] <%drzaius30> i hate when games push the play a certain way stuff heavily
[2023-01-09 02:09:55] <%JurgenRapp> tomorrow it's back to work, first meeting is in 7 hours, time to get some rest, have a good one  peepoVanish ☮️

[2023-01-09 07:49:01] <%Taylor131313> I heard you can find some grass in nokhud

[2023-01-09 10:36:02] <%PanicRush> boost my rogue in m+ BabyRage
[2023-01-09 10:36:33] <%JurgenRapp> the uninstall was a lie
[2023-01-09 10:36:58] <%PanicRush> it wasnt
[2023-01-09 10:37:11] <%PanicRush> i give up on wow
[2023-01-09 10:37:23] <%PanicRush> and become a zoe main in league
[2023-01-09 10:37:41] <%JurgenRapp> yayLeague
[2023-01-09 10:38:07] <%JurgenRapp> Sadge
[2023-01-09 10:39:13] <%JurgenRapp> just tired of wow?
[2023-01-09 10:40:09] <%PanicRush> i just dont think i can progress any more than i have reached, pugging my way to ksm was not fun at all and going past +15s is borderline impossible
[2023-01-09 10:40:49] <%PanicRush> i dont want to feel stressed from the game because i put too much effort for no gain
[2023-01-09 10:41:20] <%JurgenRapp> gotcha, yeah it seems it requires a "team" to play with to be really fun
[2023-01-09 10:42:12] <%JurgenRapp> I just thought there was enough people here but, perhaps everyone is doing there own thing
[2023-01-09 10:45:04] <%JurgenRapp> *their
[2023-01-09 10:45:24] <%Taylor131313> leave keys be and just join us for raids, you don't need to pug m+ if you find it unenjoyable
[2023-01-09 10:46:35] <%JurgenRapp> Seems so random if you are selected? Paying for something and then not know that there is a spot in the raid would suck
[2023-01-09 10:46:46] <%Taylor131313> paying?
[2023-01-09 10:46:58] <%JurgenRapp> wow subscription
[2023-01-09 10:47:04] <%Taylor131313> ah
[2023-01-09 10:47:21] <%Taylor131313> well, paying a sub doesn't force people to want to play with you, it's pretty normal anniesShrug
[2023-01-09 10:48:29] <%JurgenRapp> yeah but if you only pay to raid and then not know if there is a spot would suck, then I also would do something else
[2023-01-09 10:48:43] <%JurgenRapp> but that's just me
[2023-01-09 10:53:34] <%Taylor131313> it is how it is anniesShrug you're not entitled to raid spots, if you don't get in you have other options
[2023-01-09 10:56:07] <%JurgenRapp> yeah I understand, but I also understand panics situation.
[2023-01-09 10:56:35] <%Taylor131313> oh I understand too, I was suggesting to stick around for raids since he usually gets in
[2023-01-09 10:57:18] <%PanicRush> i mean, i'll try to
[2023-01-09 11:04:26] <%PanicRush> idk if i'll get in the next raid, i am too far behind other people
[2023-01-09 11:04:34] <%Taylor131313> you're fine
[2023-01-09 11:04:43] <%PanicRush> and queen clearly wasnt happy having me there
[2023-01-09 11:04:52] <%Taylor131313> HUH what
[2023-01-09 11:04:58] <%Geoffku> wat
[2023-01-09 11:06:34] <%drzaius30> anniesNo self loathing

[2023-01-09 11:30:35] <%drzaius30> @Taylor131313 When you get a chance can you sign into ff14 and accept shadowriders application and restore his actions rank
[2023-01-09 11:34:45] <%Taylor131313> I would do that if FF decides to accept my payment Madge
[2023-01-09 11:35:11] <%drzaius30> sub run out ?
[2023-01-09 11:35:24] <%Taylor131313> yeah, coincidentally just today LULW

[2023-01-09 11:36:17] <%drzaius30> patch is about to drop guess maybe a bit of chaos at the moment
[2023-01-09 11:37:49] <%+Sh4dowRider> Hey, thanks, no need to rush, also no need to give me actions again if enough people has it anniesHug
[2023-01-09 11:38:22] <%drzaius30> Nah you always kept pretty on top of it
[2023-01-09 11:38:49] <%drzaius30> need more people to do it anyway cause im about to resume work LUL
[2023-01-09 11:52:58] <%Geoffku> adibags kinda scuffed rn Madge

[2023-01-09 12:13:23] <%Wardrick7> i think actions will be fine for now as patch releases, people will be more active LUL
[2023-01-09 12:14:17] <%drzaius30> i had a FeelsDankMan moment yesterday because of that
[2023-01-09 12:14:44] <%Wardrick7> what happened?
[2023-01-09 12:15:15] <%drzaius30> i was server hopping trying to find anyone selling the starbird cause i wanted to see what is worth
[2023-01-09 12:15:42] <%drzaius30> was like man why are the cities packed with so many people
[2023-01-09 12:15:49] <%Wardrick7> did you try https://universalis.app/
[2023-01-09 12:16:03] <%drzaius30> herp derp day before patch people resubbing FeelsDankMan
[2023-01-09 12:16:10] <%Wardrick7> saves me a lot of time
[2023-01-09 12:16:22] <%drzaius30> @Wardrick7 Pog
[2023-01-09 12:17:07] <%Wardrick7> oh, yea, thats why i was getting a fast queue yesterday, everyone trying to get stuff just before the patch, game alive YEP
[2023-01-09 12:18:15] <%drzaius30> @Wardrick7 fun fact there is about a 90% chance if you que trial roulette you will still get battle of the big bridge anyway KEKW
[2023-01-09 12:18:30] <%drzaius30> its absurd LUL
[2023-01-09 12:19:48] <%Wardrick7> and when i was doing hildy q few months ago i couldnt find group so i had to solo LUL
[2023-01-09 12:20:42] <%drzaius30> yeah when i did it first time it was like a 25 min queue
[2023-01-09 12:20:50] <%Wardrick7> its probably the fastest way ever to farm tomestones without bluemage
[2023-01-09 12:21:57] <%elohraa> WoW has actually become so depressing to play with each expansion, the elitism is disgusting honestly
[2023-01-09 12:22:04] <%Geoffku> 14 ruby let's hope this isn't a mistake ConcernFroge
[2023-01-09 12:22:12] <%drzaius30> i really didn't need to spam it got 224 tomes just through roulettes LUL
[2023-01-09 12:22:14] <%Taylor131313> Sadge elohra
[2023-01-09 12:22:22] <%Taylor131313> and see you in either 1 hour or 10 minutes geoffku xdd
[2023-01-09 12:22:46] <%elohraa> i'm actually so annoyed, you cannot raid anymore without buying a clear for the achieve or having at least 10 friends in game willing to run with you
[2023-01-09 12:23:09] <%elohraa> expansion hasn't even been out THAT long to expect everyone to have cleared it holy christ
[2023-01-09 12:23:12] <%Wardrick7> people are very stupid with their requirements
[2023-01-09 12:23:47] <%elohraa> the irony is when I did manage to pug first few bosses for the first time I didn't die once and outhealed all the other healers
[2023-01-09 12:23:50] <%elohraa> so frustrating
[2023-01-09 12:24:27] <%Wardrick7> they want to be carried so they ask for too much, problem is overgeared people do join cause of tier pieces
[2023-01-09 12:24:33] <%Taylor131313> unfortunately if your gear is low all you can do is start your own group
[2023-01-09 12:24:43] <%elohraa> is 375 too low for normal though?
[2023-01-09 12:24:50] <%elohraa> like how did people clear it in the first few weeks LUL
[2023-01-09 12:24:53] <%Taylor131313> well... yes xdd
[2023-01-09 12:24:53] <%Wardrick7> that is the problem of pugs, they dont know how good you are and can only look at ilvl and acvhievements
[2023-01-09 12:25:01] <%Taylor131313> it's a bit low
[2023-01-09 12:25:14] <%Wardrick7> its not too low, my guild is raiding with that ilvl LUL
[2023-01-09 12:25:17] <%Swiggyswoo_> Its not low but people do it for tier set even at 400-410 ilvl
[2023-01-09 12:25:18] <%elohraa> I didn't feel I was struggling to keep up though and I was even lower than that when I pugged
[2023-01-09 12:25:19] <%Wardrick7> but for pugs its too low
[2023-01-09 12:25:21] <%Swiggyswoo_> so your chance to get invited is low
[2023-01-09 12:25:22] <%Taylor131313> could've been fine for week 1 but now almost everyone is 395+
[2023-01-09 12:25:37] <%elohraa> that's crazy though so if you don't play on release you're fucked basically
[2023-01-09 12:25:39] <%Taylor131313> we know you're good and you pump, but pugs can only see ilvl/score
[2023-01-09 12:26:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> spam m+ till youre 400 pepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 12:26:26] <%Taylor131313> or start the group and put together a group that can clear YEP
[2023-01-09 12:26:29] <%elohraa> I hate m+ did like 10 dungeons yday and got 1 item
[2023-01-09 12:26:38] <%Taylor131313> Despairge

[2023-01-09 12:26:48] <%Taylor131313> Despairge
[2023-01-09 12:27:11] <%Wardrick7> its rough if you dont have a guild or a dedicated group
[2023-01-09 12:27:27] <%elohraa> I know it was never this bad though it gets worse the longer the game exists
[2023-01-09 12:27:37] <%Taylor131313> nah but really, unfortunately if you fall behind your only way to progress is to start your own groups until you're able to catch up a bit
[2023-01-09 12:27:43] <%elohraa> I've played the game solo for years and never struggled this much to actually play the game
[2023-01-09 12:27:45] <%Taylor131313> it is really punishing if you fall behind the curve
[2023-01-09 12:27:53] <%Wardrick7> yes and it will increase cause its becoming a norm now
[2023-01-09 12:28:00] <%elohraa> depressing Sadge
[2023-01-09 12:28:25] <%Taylor131313> raid and endgame content being more accessible makes it so there's a lot more people gearing up, so it's harder to stick out when you sign up to groups
[2023-01-09 12:28:30] <%elohraa> whatever i'll just eventually get to a 'high enough' ilvl in a couple of weeks through vault hopefull.... and then have to overcome the no achieve hurdle LUL
[2023-01-09 12:28:47] <%Wardrick7> before at least geared people had no reason to do normal but tier sets changed that
[2023-01-09 12:28:48] <%Taylor131313> I farm declines constantly for keys too LULE and I played every day since release and got good gear and decent score
[2023-01-09 12:29:04] <%Wardrick7> so only catalyst might help but its too far away
[2023-01-09 12:29:25] <%Taylor131313> if you came back last week we would've taken you in for normal Sadge
[2023-01-09 12:29:42] <%elohraa> wasn't planning to play at all tbh but I got some free time now finally so thought it would be fun
[2023-01-09 12:29:45] <%elohraa> it was until now LUL
[2023-01-09 12:30:20] <%elohraa> lesson learned if you dont play on release dont bother LUL
[2023-01-09 12:34:27] <%Geoffku> 10mins was right @Taylor131313 xdd

[2023-01-09 12:38:19] <%Geoffku> elohraa could easily get a spot in next week's normal raid
[2023-01-09 12:39:03] <%elohraa> sure if there's room but its ok was just mad because of an asshole ingame who went out of his way to get me kicked and send me nasty whispers
[2023-01-09 12:39:11] <%elohraa> i'll catch up in time
[2023-01-09 12:39:11] <%Geoffku> anniesSole
[2023-01-09 12:39:16] <%Taylor131313> the problem is there isn't one, that's why I mentioned it Sadge
[2023-01-09 12:39:24] <%Taylor131313> she was planning to do only the achiev run
[2023-01-09 12:39:40] <%Geoffku> oh Hmmm
[2023-01-09 12:39:58] <%elohraa> all good, will catch up eventually and i'll just do other stuff in the meantime
[2023-01-09 12:46:00] <%Wardrick7> i think you could join us for at least few HC bosses
[2023-01-09 12:48:11] <%elohraa> nahh don't wanna be carried, i'll join one day maybe when i'm geared enough
[2023-01-09 12:48:30] <%Taylor131313> nono you come
[2023-01-09 12:48:39] <%elohraa> just wanted to rant but rant over now KEKW

[2023-01-09 12:49:07] <%Taylor131313> plus you probably still pump even with shit gear
[2023-01-09 12:51:19] <%elohraa> imagine giving PI to a warlock
[2023-01-09 12:51:23] <%Taylor131313> AYO

[2023-01-09 15:50:56] <%Taylor131313> nah this is worse, I actively hate 4/8 dungeons
[2023-01-09 15:51:06] <%Makkan780> i likemost of them
[2023-01-09 15:51:22] <%Taylor131313> jade, AV, RLP and nokhud need to be purged by Arthas and then burned by Sylvanas
[2023-01-09 15:52:14] <%Makkan780> im not a fan of AV but thats about it
[2023-01-09 15:52:34] <%Makkan780> also hate HoV
[2023-01-09 15:52:42] <%Mirkooo> For me it's Nokhud, i assume same for Taylor after 42 runs xdd
[2023-01-09 15:52:44] <%Taylor131313> HOV would be fine with some nerfs
[2023-01-09 15:52:51] <%Mirkooo> But i always hated super long dungeons, i prefer <30 min ones
[2023-01-09 15:52:55] <%Makkan780> just a few min more on the timer
[2023-01-09 15:52:58] <%Taylor131313> Despairge LET FLY Despairge OPEN FIRE Despairge TURBO WHEELCHAIR GO BRRRRRRRR
[2023-01-09 15:53:18] <%Makkan780> in nokkhund you can still time it after 2-3 wipes
[2023-01-09 15:53:18] <%Taylor131313> Ruby life is 30, but would probably need 40 if not further nerfs xdd
[2023-01-09 15:53:23] <%Makkan780> but in HoV you are done after 1
[2023-01-09 15:53:42] <%Taylor131313> depends on where you wipe, if on a boss after using BL then sure LUL
[2023-01-09 15:53:59] <%Makkan780> even then its fine in nokkund
[2023-01-09 15:54:14] <%Taylor131313> eh, doing 2nd and 4th boss without lust is pure misery
[2023-01-09 15:54:54] <%PneumaWHU> ruby is my 3rd highest score

[2023-01-09 23:47:08] <%drzaius30> looks like it
[2023-01-09 23:47:26] <%drzaius30> weird choice for the lopporrits
[2023-01-09 23:48:11] <%Wardrick7> they could have gave us a flying carrot and we got this Madge
[2023-01-09 23:48:15] <%drzaius30> was expecting some sort of mech like the ones in bestways burrow or smiletown
[2023-01-09 23:50:10] <%drzaius30> space jellyfish is best beast tribe mount anyway NODDERS
[2023-01-09 23:50:36] <%Wardrick7> i also like the tank mount
[2023-01-09 23:50:49] <%drzaius30> Tank is great as well
[2023-01-09 23:50:50] <%Wardrick7> only problem its from lala tribe catGAG
[2023-01-09 23:51:09] <%drzaius30> ff4 reference when the dwarves had tanks YEP
[2023-01-09 23:51:52] <%drzaius30> @Wardrick7 tbf at least its a group of lalas which try to not look like lalas KEKW
[2023-01-09 23:52:17] <%Wardrick7> true, if only they kept their helms on all the time LUL
[2023-01-09 23:52:54] <%NoName6834> no gathering class to get that mount Sadge
[2023-01-09 23:53:26] <%drzaius30> i leveled fisher in 2 days for it KEKW
[2023-01-09 23:53:40] <%Wardrick7> gathering is very easy to lvl with levequests
[2023-01-09 23:53:44] <%NoName6834> I like that mech mount
[2023-01-09 23:53:47] <%drzaius30> being able to buy fish really spend up the questing
[2023-01-09 23:54:01] <%Wardrick7> crafting is the annoying one if you dont lvl all of them
[2023-01-09 23:54:20] <%drzaius30> what about culinarian ?
[2023-01-09 23:54:30] <%Wardrick7> didnt try that one

[2023-01-09 23:55:11] <%drzaius30> xdd
[2023-01-09 23:55:22] <%Wardrick7> i lvled most of them with grad-company turn ins so now all are at 50
[2023-01-09 23:55:27] <%drzaius30> thats why you buy the fish instead of catching LUL
[2023-01-09 23:55:28] <%Wardrick7> only carpenter is at max
[2023-01-09 23:56:17] <%NoName6834> is the ocean expeditions still good?

[2023-01-09 23:57:40] <%Wardrick7> i heard ocean fishing is the thing which actually makes fishing fun
[2023-01-09 23:57:42] <%drzaius30> 🦈
[2023-01-09 23:57:47] <%Wardrick7> should try it someday
[2023-01-09 23:58:04] <%Wardrick7> cause i hated regular fishing
[2023-01-09 23:58:14] <%drzaius30> i just fished while watching stream was actually really chill
[2023-01-09 23:58:43] <%Wardrick7> yes until you need specific fish
[2023-01-09 23:58:50] <%Wardrick7> then its not fun LUL
