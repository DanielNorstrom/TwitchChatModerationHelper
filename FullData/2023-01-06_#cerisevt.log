[2023-01-06 14:59:59] <Reishella> technically you could argue surviving mars is 'challenging' until you get the first wonder going (which is often the mohole)
[2023-01-06 15:00:03] <%AriaNottoVT> hi iffie
[2023-01-06 15:00:24] <!%RickAltair> Oh man, after finding time and a spot to catch a decent nap at work, I see why peeps wanna do it all the time now.  It's kinda great.
[2023-01-06 15:00:32] <Reishella> but y'know you got like a billion resources as 'limited'
[2023-01-06 15:00:38] <%AriaNottoVT> this game looks fun o.o
[2023-01-06 15:00:56] <+Tarotking> it depends on how it holds up to 7 days for me
[2023-01-06 15:01:02] <Reishella> and then there's the weird grind method devs do
[2023-01-06 15:01:28] <!%$JulesKrark> one piece odyssey launches next week

[2023-01-06 15:01:32] <!%$JulesKrark> should I get disappointed?
[2023-01-06 15:01:36] <Reishella> 'get 10k iron blocks and you can have this machine that produces 1 iron block per day indenfinitely!'
[2023-01-06 15:01:38] <%AriaNottoVT> cozy housr
[2023-01-06 15:01:45] <%Iffiie> @AriaNottoVT hope you feel better soon winter269MtcHug

[2023-01-06 15:02:02] <Reishella> yeah ok indefinitely but like....I got 10k iron blocks....why do I need your machine again?
[2023-01-06 15:02:07] <!%$JulesKrark> which is a bad sign usually
[2023-01-06 15:02:08] <!%$JulesKrark> KEKW
[2023-01-06 15:02:09] <@%+Erazu> I don't like one piece but the game looks pretty neat

[2023-01-06 15:02:33] <!Skarbimir> SIS!?
[2023-01-06 15:02:34] <+Tarotking> temper expectation with understanding and patience
