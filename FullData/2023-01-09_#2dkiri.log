[2023-01-09 13:48:02] <%agravicvoid> The thing that worked for me to fix the ammo issue was to ditch the quivers with parentheses around them- somehow those are bugged, then I made new quivers. My dwarves started picking up ammo after I did that

[2023-01-09 13:48:29] <ZionCzan> you have to make a stock pile in there barracks for ammo that doesn't allow bins. the problem is the can't grab out of bins. it's because the all go to take ammo at the same time and the game doesn't allow more then one person to pull from a bin/barrel
[2023-01-09 13:48:57] <+Stef90> oh right, i have my archers in leather armours

[2023-01-09 13:56:20] <%agravicvoid> From my understanding, sometimes the traded quivers still have an owner, so they don’t work correctly

[2023-01-09 14:29:34] <%agravicvoid> If they are really really mad and want to fight, sometimes I’ll put them in their own squad and have them fight a wild animal or something and that usually helps, but with 200+ dwarves the idea of micromanaging them gives the gift of anxiety

[2023-01-09 14:46:04] <!%TheMoenia> i dont think there is any point to have adamantine quivers
[2023-01-09 14:46:44] <!%TheMoenia> because there is no difference in damage between copper crossbows and steelcrossbows
[2023-01-09 14:47:00] <+Jaetonik> Crossbows doesn't matter what material. They only thing that it would change is the melee damage of the cross bow.
[2023-01-09 14:47:01] <!%TheMoenia> so its just more economical to use copper
[2023-01-09 14:47:01] <squirrelrk> I live in Ireland, no amount of climate change will remove winter from here
[2023-01-09 14:47:20] <!%TheMoenia> and even for the melee damage i think copper is better than steel

[2023-01-09 14:53:09] <!%TheMoenia> since silver is denser than steel, the blunt weapons are more effective when made out of silver
[2023-01-09 14:53:21] <Virtualspaceman> weapons inherit stats from material types,  ie weapons that rely on blunt mass will deliver heaver strikes with heaver materials

[2023-01-09 15:10:35] <%$CommonTater_> But Kiri, it's so much better than the trash it used to be grimmpDerp
[2023-01-09 15:10:42] <%JebusJebebus> am i the only one who cant stop making new forts
[2023-01-09 15:11:06] <cladmi> It's really something I also felt when watching people play "ohh for doing A you need B" how should one know that they need to do A and how do they know they need B for that?
[2023-01-09 15:11:10] <+nukethebunnys> the UI was unusable before, now its barely playable. It is now the first (df classic) and 2nd most obtuse game ever created
[2023-01-09 15:11:14] <+Stef90> death by own trap incoming :D
[2023-01-09 15:11:18] <!%TheMoenia> just the mouse support is such an improvement
[2023-01-09 15:11:18] <+booloodian> Yes. Hopefully there will be more and drastic UI improvements incoming. It will certainly help that ToadyOne has brought in a new dev.
[2023-01-09 15:11:28] <squirrelrk> @JebusJebebus I tend to make new ones every few dozen hours or so
[2023-01-09 15:11:31] <+Sincineah> I love the idea of the game and everything but I just can't bring up the energy to try and learn it all :D

[2023-01-09 15:12:30] <blokmuscle> All due respect, Kiri, DF is very 'finished' and just continually being improved.  It's an extremely complex game (hence the, simple on the surface, then you reach the cliff) and the wiki is a way to improve your understanding of the internals of the mechanics. , but is not a requirement for the games enjoyment.  Discovery is a lot of what makes  the game fun.  It could benefit from QoL changes, but all games can.

[2023-01-09 15:14:44] <blokmuscle> Tarn has a huge list of things he wants to implement in the game, for sure.  It's not complete in that aspect.  And also the current version within Steam does not contain Adventure mode, which some players consider to be half the game as well.  There's a lot to this game.  Rimworld, Minecraft, and many others, were inspired and built around the idea of this game.
[2023-01-09 15:14:50] <+Sincineah> the eye tracker is so useful with this game :D

[2023-01-09 15:22:31] <+Telear> sometimes, your nobles will mandate something that you simply can't build (impossible materials, usually) and even if you have a none-deadly justice system set up, the noble won't necessarily be mollified, so replacing them by violence becomes tempting
[2023-01-09 15:22:46] <squirrelrk> not sure
[2023-01-09 15:22:47] <%JebusJebebus> be a shame if the mayor had an accident

[2023-01-09 15:24:36] <+Telear> The fun really starts when you start cooking up ways to eliminate your noble by their own hand without completely destroying them. After all, you want to use that tomb don't you?

[2023-01-09 15:26:45] <+Telear> I had a system set up that flooded the noble's quarters to 7/7 depth and if they didn't learn to swim really quickly, *boom* new leader. Then the next leader would pull another leader to close the fill hatch and drain the quarters. Once the old layabout was buried [not in the tomb they thought they were getting] and the room dried out, it got allocated to the next victim, sorry, noble.
[2023-01-09 15:27:24] <JamshidShah> @Telear What if the noble learned to swim?

[2023-01-09 15:52:14] <!%TheMoenia> the minimum number of soldiers, what do yall think aobut lowering it a bit
[2023-01-09 15:52:21] <MasterActio> I lost 120 dwarves to 1 forgotten beast :(
[2023-01-09 15:52:31] <MasterActio> before I got it trapped in a hallway
[2023-01-09 15:52:40] <+fadingathedges> Where it says "Minimum number of soldiers to follow new order"  = no one trains unless they all train together.
[2023-01-09 15:52:43] <%BillFerShort> Sounds like they'll remember that beast now
[2023-01-09 15:52:47] <crundlematic> that is one mighty interface, once you figure it out
[2023-01-09 15:52:49] <MasterActio> yeah
[2023-01-09 15:52:54] <MasterActio> was at 200 dwarves
[2023-01-09 15:52:59] <%+Jeff2PointOh> I bet the beast will not be forgotten again ;)
[2023-01-09 15:53:01] <MasterActio> then down to 80
[2023-01-09 15:53:20] <MasterActio> then had wear bear show up and knock me down to 50
[2023-01-09 15:53:26] <crundlematic> nah. they will try to fill that quota. they will still train if theres less
[2023-01-09 15:53:40] <%+mattress_wolf> get them buckets
[2023-01-09 15:53:47] <MasterActio> started getting migrants, then people were showing up drained of blood, so I had to deal with ghosts everywhere

[2023-01-09 15:54:07] <+farning81> alextwHI
[2023-01-09 15:54:09] <crundlematic> you can set special orders in that menu, like have 2 train, 2 on patrol and 6 off duty for example

[2023-01-09 15:56:29] <crundlematic> should angle the bow by 45°, that would solve all that

[2023-01-09 15:59:14] <+Sincineah> are there different colored floors? then you could just make a big room and paint the things in with floors?
[2023-01-09 15:59:38] <crundlematic> you could use different colors for the floors, yeah

[2023-01-09 16:13:21] <Nebukadnezzer> Luckily I think that dwarf fortress is about as likely to cause motion sickness as a real-life painting

[2023-01-09 16:13:27] <Mr_Quackums> hunters should only be military if xbow squad, miners should only he in pick squads.  changing between job/military uniforms is ... iffy

[2023-01-09 16:32:31] <!%TheMoenia> what i mean is, i THINK you get 1.2 bars of metal out of one stack bolts while only needing 1 bar of metal to make it
[2023-01-09 16:32:48] <+fadingathedges> You can melt down metal ammo you don't need at your smelter.

[2023-01-09 16:32:53] <+fadingathedges> And reclaim some bars
[2023-01-09 16:33:03] <crundlematic> theres stacked bolts and single bolts... when you smelt a stack of 25 there is a net loss on metal
[2023-01-09 16:33:07] <+fadingathedges> ope commercialing :D
[2023-01-09 16:33:17] <!%+Wrinxz> @TheMoenia That seems like a design flaw. You could do that in perpetuity and have infinite metal
[2023-01-09 16:33:34] <!%TheMoenia> @Wrinxz yeah i think its technically an exploit
[2023-01-09 16:33:38] <gnarlsdarwin> @reddvvv Sounds like I need to do some learning
[2023-01-09 16:33:46] <crundlematic> it is an exploit all right. most things have negative returns tho

[2023-01-09 17:01:40] <+ARCHmatux> So the issue with seeds in barrels, is dwarfs take the entire barrel for one seed and all other jobs involving it fail.  Typically "fixed" if you have two stockpiles for seeds, one with barrels, one without barrels and set the no barrel stockpile to give to the barrel stockpile.
[2023-01-09 17:01:44] <+ARCHmatux> The wiki page on seeds is good.

[2023-01-09 17:03:30] <!%TheMoenia> that would be handy
[2023-01-09 17:03:37] <+rockjitsu> i'd like if the stockpiles would remember that you set bins to 0 on purpose and not max it out if you ever add another type of gem for example
[2023-01-09 17:04:00] <+ARCHmatux> I think DFHack has functionality like that - might be a while until it's ready for the Steam Release though

[2023-01-09 17:04:27] <!%TheMoenia> some of my lower levels resemble absolute swiss cheese because i love vein mining way too much
[2023-01-09 17:04:40] <darxzan> there is so much of inefficiency in current dwarf fortress yet
[2023-01-09 17:05:25] <!%TheMoenia> oh yeah i make single wide exploratory tunnes and then just drag select everything usefull
[2023-01-09 17:05:30] <+Dongbroz> my only issue with swiss cheese is that more cheese=less cheese

[2023-01-09 17:13:04] <crundlematic> and each can take 10 weapons

[2023-01-09 17:16:24] <crundlematic> thats odd. that *should* just work...
[2023-01-09 17:16:35] <glennhoutch> Yes- I follow him, but he has no vids on Dwarf children
[2023-01-09 17:16:44] <+ARCHmatux> I always look for areas with a lot of very deep cliffs. If I can find multiple rivers merging with a waterfall or two that's ideal.

[2023-01-09 17:40:29] <+ggeodudee> if a ranged uniform is not assigned on creation of the squad, they will not pick up bolts due to this bug
[2023-01-09 17:40:31] <+booloodian> I think that those ranged squaddies won't pick up quivers until they get a crossbow.

[2023-01-09 18:29:12] <duVillage> Two very important tips: get a WiFi box for 3~4 euro per day, so you will have internet at all times. Order your Japan Rail Pass BEFORE you go, it will be a lot cheaper, even cheaper than what the local population pays.
