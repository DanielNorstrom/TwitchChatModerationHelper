[2022-12-08 03:38:15] <@%^Nightbot> I know ads suck, but I will be donating ad revenue in the form of PC's, consoles, peripherals, etc. to members of my community who can't afford them on their own. Subs do not have to watch any ads.

He invented pb milkies (spoon of pb and chug milk and repeat). His favorite lunch is mustard sandwiches. Wattson has complained his soup was too salty... he drank it straight from can without warming it up. Wattson enjoys the prowler unironicly. Wattson is originally from Arkansas (it's a real place).

[2022-12-08 16:24:05] <+jd933> @nogoodcharles they're all different drugs/have and do different things.  While having similar effects while on them there are differences especially with side effects just look it up, not getting into full chem discussions on twitch chat.  Google can help significantly

[2022-12-08 16:24:09] <+Hannibalism_> @antotheterrifying Yes, it has dextroamphetamine, amphetamine aspartate and two sulfates of both. Vyvanse is lisdexamphetamine which is a form of dextro that your liver metabolizes.

[2022-12-08 17:31:19] <+Freakazoid991> I think cheaters shouldn’t be banned. Instead, the game detects them cheating and gives you cheats to destroy them. That way people are incentivized to not cheat.

[2022-12-08 18:37:17] <%+Hitosherizu> Honestly, not pinging loot for your teammates is the correct decision. If you ping loot for your teammates, that reduces their ability to find their own and become better. Your teammates should be good enough to find their own loot, or you should just get new teammates.

[2022-12-08 20:03:00] <@%^Nightbot> Honestly, nobody puts in as much work as TSM, they train for hours, and Hal's even working on controller so he can be even better at this game. Verhulst is literally beaming kids with his eyes closed with how much time he's put in on apex. The addition of Reps and Raven to their team just proves that they have a winning mindset and are focused on the grind. With all of this hard work and effort, they can easily secure a top 15 spot in the next ALGS, #TSMWIN

[2022-12-08 20:39:55] <jusbeatbox> look at $PHVS @HisWattson people are making a lot of money on that right now
[2022-12-08 20:39:58] <Omni35> Pete rose got caught, and Calvin  ridley got caught i doubt they'd be able to hide mj gambling on the bulls winning
[2022-12-08 20:39:59] <+bman00728> made 156k of Mullen Automotive (penny stock)
[2022-12-08 20:39:59] <+Khirality> isn't this a fun mode
[2022-12-08 20:39:59] <Parrkour1> im an advisor. most penny stocks actually never appreciate to a higher value. most big wins would be getting in a larger company during their IPO and hoping they continue to grow. like an apple or amazon type of move

[2022-12-08 20:40:20] <socratic2> Aren’t penny stock investments for the long haul though? Or are they better for immediate return?
[2022-12-08 20:40:23] <wolfpup29> hi Wattson
[2022-12-08 20:40:26] <jusbeatbox> it's not an investment though, very short term intraday trades. never holding over night in this market
[2022-12-08 20:40:26] <+boopsnoottv> @hiswattson have you looked at $FIDIN I made 30k off it

[2022-12-08 20:40:35] <%+Hitosherizu> @Omni35 Nobody hid it, everybody knew that he was a huge gambler, they just refused to acknowledge it because he was the main reason the NBA had revenue coming in
[2022-12-08 20:40:52] <AAron2128SC> If someone is telling you a penny stock is going to go to X amount...they're lying, it might pump but it'll come right back down, OTC is just manipulated hard

[2022-12-08 20:41:47] <+boopsnoottv> if you think tsla is a growth stock ur not investing in $FIDIN
[2022-12-08 20:41:47] <!%SchugDoog> You’re betting that the market share of the company is going to grow
[2022-12-08 20:41:47] <tony_3188> yes you want to invest in stocks that pay dividends or funds that pay dividends and reinvest that money... the power of compounding is the 8th wonder of the world
[2022-12-08 20:41:48] <Parrkour1> @socratic2 noooooo they are generally very volatile. alot of advisors wont even deal with them or hold them for clients.
[2022-12-08 20:42:28] <+boopsnoottv> chat what's your thoughts on $FIDIN
[2022-12-08 20:42:28] <%SYRPTOH> Same bro
[2022-12-08 20:42:36] <cskthegr8> u already watched wolf of the wall street
[2022-12-08 20:42:37] <Omni35> @hitosherizu the reason I'm asking about this specifically is it's the first time I'm hearing he bet on the bulls. like I said gambling and being in debt is fine.
[2022-12-08 20:42:38] <+o0_YOSHI_0o> Predict which company is gonna make money, invest, and hope they make money for you
[2022-12-08 20:42:43] <Parrkour1> @tony_3188 this is the answer. find good mutual funds or blue chip stocks and turn on dividend reinvest and dollar cost average every month. being a millionaire is not difficult
[2022-12-08 20:42:48] <+sgng_leotrex> why furia?
[2022-12-08 20:42:48] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?

[2022-12-08 20:42:54] <ferrum234> basically it's gambling
[2022-12-08 20:42:54] <Omni35> @hitosherizu what is your source?
[2022-12-08 20:43:13] <+boopsnoottv> @atreides219 $FIDIN dis dick in yo mouf
[2022-12-08 20:43:16] <NggyWing> The logic is the company retains more money to invest which leads to more growth which when you sell the stock will in theory be at a higher price than if they didn’t have the money to invest.

[2022-12-08 20:49:36] <Kaliente__> Loba ult on winter express should just put a gif of Loba doing the golf emote in the middle of your screen.
[2022-12-08 20:49:39] <+KaiseTh0> it was fun cause you were solo
[2022-12-08 20:49:39] <%khonvoumm> It’s because you didn’t change your in game name!
[2022-12-08 20:49:39] <+ShakieTV_> It reminds me of the time with my family, having a shootout on the train
[2022-12-08 20:49:39] <@%mmm_high> told ya

[2022-12-08 20:49:55] <@%^Nightbot> As a controller player, i for one cannot wait for tap-strafing to be removed. Us controller players have suffered for far too long at the hands and arms of mnk players. It's cheating, it has no counterplay and i can't do it. Remove it now
[2022-12-08 20:50:02] <asazein> Now tell me why did smashed your TV? Wattson

[2022-12-08 20:55:28] <!%SchugDoog> Anyone wonder why in the 2nd episode of The Walking Dead on AMC, they put zombie guts all over them. This allows them to move through a crowd of zombies without being bit.   THEN THEY DONT USE THIS TACTIC FOR 7 MORE SEASONS.  It’s pretty much a cheat code and they go “na we good”
