[2022-12-23 10:25:41] <%bunglinglummox> The Gorlak is technically a wild animal, but can be safely ignored. It has the "benign" tag, which makes it nonaggressive unless you *really* piss it off. And it's not that dangerous.
[2022-12-23 10:25:43] <$sircool099> a ranger and what?

[2022-12-23 10:53:07] <Synesh> Some news aboult old Dwarf Fortress is starting to show up on popular media. One example is about how you could control historical figures in adventure mode. But the game would count them as possessed so the other dwarfs wouldn't react normally to them.
[2022-12-23 10:53:19] <+catteusofmars> i noticed you can make the dwarfs ride the carts.... anyone tried to make bus system?
[2022-12-23 10:53:26] <!%PepperKuroaji> could that mean the horns aren't being stolen, but being turned invisible...? yokaiHmm

[2022-12-23 10:54:13] <%+phantomsalmon> fun info, if you manage to catch a dragon (good luck with that), you can tame it
[2022-12-23 10:54:20] <%Graknorke> dwarves only use carts for hauling, is the thing. they won't path through the system so to speak
[2022-12-23 10:54:20] <%Memil03> 33 food for 98 dwarfs xD is that bad?
[2022-12-23 10:54:23] <!%PepperKuroaji> a soup filled with lies
[2022-12-23 10:54:24] <%bunglinglummox> someone made a device called a "watervator", which is basically an elevator made of water, requiring dwarves to swim to the desired level
[2022-12-23 10:54:28] <%bunglinglummox> it's completely useless
[2022-12-23 10:54:30] <%bunglinglummox> but they did it

[2022-12-23 10:56:10] <Synesh> Even better, then that was fixed, you were controlling them but their mind and soul wouldn't really change, and so since they couldn't do about it since you were controlling them, all they could do is cry. And other dwarfs will notice it.

[2022-12-23 11:55:28] <Gdammit> random question but is there any way to deal with the holes left by trees after you cut them? I'm on my first fort and I just noticed random holes in the "roof"  PepeHands

[2022-12-23 11:56:15] <+catteusofmars> should have dug deeper :D but you can allways just cover the holes with new floor
[2022-12-23 11:56:16] <thelittlememer> You can build -> construct -> floors to cover them @gdammit
[2022-12-23 11:56:35] <Gdammit> oh thanks, I'll try
[2022-12-23 11:56:44] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> I was going to say "a dom smasher" but you already clarified it to be an atom smasher yokaiSigh

[2022-12-23 13:25:23] <$MyrkDomolith> High amount of seeds can just happen if you gather plants a lot or have a lot of farms set up. Having a lot of seeds and really low food/drink says you need a better farm setup- usually smaller individual plots, or needing cavern soil for underground crops.
[2022-12-23 13:26:11] VIEWERS: 211
[2022-12-23 13:26:31] <$MyrkDomolith> Actual cavern soil- as in down in the cavern. Topsoil like that being used for underground crops, divides the output by 5.
