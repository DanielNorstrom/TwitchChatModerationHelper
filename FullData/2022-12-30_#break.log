[2022-12-30 10:58:22] <%uni1> when I stopped watching the other day you were talking about not ordering take aways
[2022-12-30 10:58:23] <%+Robbeh27> how's the binaural audio setting working out
[2022-12-30 10:58:29] <%uni1> now you are ordering McDs :D

[2022-12-30 10:58:37] <%LiamG> Hayz did proper testing with binarual audio
[2022-12-30 10:58:38] <%+Robbeh27> good
[2022-12-30 10:58:41] <%LiamG> he had no FPS difference on/off
[2022-12-30 10:58:46] <%LiamG> it's a myth. or specific hardware.
[2022-12-30 10:58:52] <%LiamG> and he prefers the audio with it on

[2022-12-30 11:00:07] <%Hopsecution> sredeKomrade
[2022-12-30 11:00:13] <%LiamG> 32GB of very fast ram solves the issue he said
[2022-12-30 11:00:14] <%heretical_himbo> mine!
[2022-12-30 11:00:24] <%LiamG> he thinks it's a RAM problem
[2022-12-30 11:00:31] <%IbnK666> Inb4 he runs into mines himself
[2022-12-30 11:00:35] <%+Robbeh27> I have 32gb 3600mhz
[2022-12-30 11:00:48] <%+Robbeh27> so only DDR 5 is faster really
[2022-12-30 11:00:58] <%ManSolo> Nikita- we can't optimize so buy better ram
[2022-12-30 11:01:14] <@%GreggStrat> sRede he only flicked to the keybinds for a second in that clip LUL

[2022-12-30 11:01:29] <%ringstAbekk> DDR5 isn't very optimised at the moment, might get better out of OC DDR4
[2022-12-30 11:01:30] <%ManSolo> McD is here
[2022-12-30 11:01:30] <%LiamG> 3600mhz isn't that fast really
[2022-12-30 11:01:32] <%+Skarym_> BRAND
[2022-12-30 11:01:35] <@%sRede> imo the game would benefit more from cache than ram speed, so 5800x3d would probably run this the best

[2022-12-30 11:01:51] <%+BBGunOcelot_> I have 32GB DDR5 5600MHz, can confirm it's no better. MAybe fast DDR4 is the answer for now
[2022-12-30 11:01:51] <%LiamG> you can get 4200mhz+ DDR4
[2022-12-30 11:01:51] VIEWERS: 496
[2022-12-30 11:02:00] <%+Robbeh27> 3600 DDR 4 is pretty quick lol
[2022-12-30 11:02:27] <%LiamG> i've have 4000mhz RAM for like 5 years now... so i have to assume even that's slow
[2022-12-30 11:02:39] <%LiamG> by modern standards
[2022-12-30 11:02:43] <%Darkmascott> 3200-3600 is probs the average ram speed
[2022-12-30 11:02:49] <%+Robbeh27> even DDR 5 5000+ the difference is negligible
[2022-12-30 11:02:56] <%Darkmascott> and get faster ram is no excuse for shit coding
[2022-12-30 11:03:05] <@%Breakspear> IMO the game would benefit with nicer trees, like from DayZ
[2022-12-30 11:03:22] <%$Spokee01> Better inventory sounds @breakspear
[2022-12-30 11:03:24] <%ManSolo> @Breakspear or some nice mountains to look at

[2022-12-30 11:03:46] <@%sRede> Darkmascott what do you mean? a map with 4 streets and a square showed in a trailer 2 years ago released just after new gen cpu and gpu is just a coincidence Shruge

[2022-12-30 11:04:10] <%+BBGunOcelot_> I have a problem with Amazon drivers just dropping it on the doorstep and fucking off...
[2022-12-30 11:04:12] <%+RJACE_> yeh, they have to get through the building main gate and then ring again at the block door here
[2022-12-30 11:04:12] <+dadNladz> mine wont use the doorbell
[2022-12-30 11:04:16] <%IbnK666> You must have a thicc door then
[2022-12-30 11:04:22] <Loiner> Apparently there's a shortage of drivers atm so they just take anyone on

[2022-12-30 11:04:57] <%ringstAbekk> sadly having 32GB (more that 16GB) of RAM is the way games and programs are going
[2022-12-30 11:04:57] <+HuwW123> I live in a flat above a pub - the only pub on the street - and it mentions the pub on my address. I've had calls from driver literally sat across the road from the entrance saying they can't find it
[2022-12-30 11:04:57] <%+Skarym_> scav queues still in the bin?
[2022-12-30 11:05:06] <%+RJACE_> is the breakfast roll decent?
[2022-12-30 11:05:20] <@%GreggStrat> Sometimes my delivery drivers knock like their hands are made of pillows. So light you can barely hear it
[2022-12-30 11:05:29] <%FDeppy> Spokee01 i saw a delivery guy stop at my appartment once and then call me saying he cant find it KEKW
[2022-12-30 11:05:46] <@%sRede> ringstAbekk tbf going from 16gb to 32gb is not that big of an investment compared to a gpu upgrade nowdays

[2022-12-30 11:22:46] <%LiamG> I'm pretty sure that's what i had for.... most of december
[2022-12-30 11:22:47] <%just_ollii> they used to just watch netflix, but that's noit a thing anymore now
[2022-12-30 11:23:12] <%ringstAbekk> all in favour of 4 day work week
[2022-12-30 11:23:14] <%+RJACE_> they'd work half a day and work another programmer job after without them knowing
[2022-12-30 11:23:19] <%LiamG> thing is, we decide what we do each day
[2022-12-30 11:23:20] <%+KopiteTV> thing is with that is people would rush and make mistakes
[2022-12-30 11:23:33] <%Richjones19772000> But they might rush it no make mistakes ?
[2022-12-30 11:23:36] <%nosu> Thats how i do, i dont have breaks i just do everything i have to do and gtfo
[2022-12-30 11:23:40] <%+KopiteTV> i always suggest that idea and its just not practical for business side of things
[2022-12-30 11:23:41] <@%Breakspear> There are days where I have all my tasks done by 1pm.
[2022-12-30 11:23:53] <%nosu> but dont tell my boss
[2022-12-30 11:23:55] VIEWERS: 604
[2022-12-30 11:23:58] <Dalleren> which is exactly why we should start practicing stuff like 4-day work weeks. People end up doing the same amount of work as in 5 days
[2022-12-30 11:24:01] <%just_ollii> i'd like to do a 4 day work week and 3 day weekend, they starting to do that in belgium now
[2022-12-30 11:24:06] <%ringstAbekk> flexi-working has been my savour
[2022-12-30 11:24:06] <%MitosisDNB> most companies will just think, we can get someone who will work that fast and do all the hours instead
[2022-12-30 11:24:11] <pecanpecanpecan> Think the research says that people who work 8 hour days are only productive around 3 hours ... proper waste of time.
[2022-12-30 11:24:12] <%+Arkonios_> WFH i can get work done in meetings (that should have been an email)
[2022-12-30 11:24:17] <%Richjones19772000> Tbf that’s a decent idea
[2022-12-30 11:24:24] <%FDeppy> i need to work 38 hours a week and have x tasks done every month

[2022-12-30 11:36:35] <%+elan_o7> tbh, they probably bin the lot of it, so none of your recylcling would get recyled

[2022-12-30 12:25:04] <%LiamG> Alienware's monitor is the one of the best on the market.
[2022-12-30 12:25:13] <john_the_human> @liamdubheadscott not this 240hz monitor though. One of the best

[2022-12-30 14:09:39] <@%Breakspear> @LiamG the issue with the Spectator, along with all other media, is they handpick the stats to sensationalise a story to sell papers. They leave out the stats that contradict their "evidence"

[2022-12-30 14:11:40] <Halsti> the reports till now were around the lines of 'chat up women. invites them to romania. once there, demands that they do live streamed shows.' from what i understand there were no direct threats, but very much so implied ones. idk where it'll go from here.
[2022-12-30 14:11:43] <%+CoyneDawg> Tate tweeted a couple hours ago so unless someone else is tweeting for him
[2022-12-30 14:11:50] <%jrasell> they have to charge you or release you

[2022-12-30 14:11:54] <%g0dilla> being arrested and being in jail are different things tho

[2022-12-30 14:12:12] <@%Breakspear> @liamG I'm not doubting their stats, but again, I think they will leave out stuff to make a story out of it, otherwise they wont sell papers
[2022-12-30 14:12:18] <%+SweedChef> Again, he wasn't arrested. There are no charges. Just gathering evidence probably
[2022-12-30 14:12:24] <%kleier> they ain't gonna build a case to charge in 24hrs
