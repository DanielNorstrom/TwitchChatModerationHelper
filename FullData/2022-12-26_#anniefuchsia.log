[2022-12-26 13:52:02] <%Taylor131313> wait, 12?
[2022-12-26 13:54:02] <%PanicRush> depleted 13 gives me 12
[2022-12-26 13:54:44] <%Taylor131313> what happened to the 14
[2022-12-26 13:54:59] <%PanicRush> dude died to the storm on hyrja, said bb and left mid fight
[2022-12-26 13:55:05] <%Taylor131313> TrollDespair
[2022-12-26 13:55:16] <%Geoffku> oof
[2022-12-26 13:56:06] <%Hezmund> honestly needs to be some punishment feature for leavers, most toxic thing you can do
[2022-12-26 14:00:09] <%Taylor131313> holding people hostage of a doomed key is also toxic, there's no solution to the problem
[2022-12-26 14:04:43] <%PanicRush> wiping on a boss doesnt immediately doom a key and i still prefer to finish it even overtime just to get the loot and a new key
[2022-12-26 14:05:21] <%Taylor131313> yes, that is true, but sometimes it's very clear the key is doomed and is gonna be a disaster
[2022-12-26 14:05:29] <%Taylor131313> not your case clearly, but I saw many of those
[2022-12-26 14:05:46] <%PanicRush> aaaaanyways, +12 azure vault, what can possibly go wrong Clueless
[2022-12-26 14:06:02] <%Taylor131313> 3rd boss TrollDespair
[2022-12-26 14:06:24] <%Hezmund> i've had for more cases of people leaving after dying to their own mistake than anything else
[2022-12-26 14:06:40] <%PanicRush> it has more than 2 bosses? none of my groups has managed to get past 2nd boss yet xdd
[2022-12-26 14:06:44] <%Hezmund> also never their own key
[2022-12-26 14:07:04] <%Swiggyswoo_> 3rd boss is the easiest one in there
[2022-12-26 14:07:20] <%PanicRush> true and real and based and true
[2022-12-26 14:07:38] <%Taylor131313> I can do 0 dps as demo

[2022-12-26 15:09:07] <%PanicRush> 0 deaths most of the way, going fast and easy, 3 chest right in our grasp

[2022-12-26 15:10:50] <%PanicRush> last boss time
[2022-12-26 15:11:00] <%PanicRush> healer gets oneshotted because moving from the breath is hard
