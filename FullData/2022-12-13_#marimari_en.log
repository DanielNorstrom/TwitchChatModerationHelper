[2022-12-13 10:34:15] <%djkawaiifieri> I think up to at least Underground 2

[2022-12-13 10:34:29] <%djkawaiifieri> Underground 1 is the best
[2022-12-13 10:34:30] <%kaiserSet> Gameqube don‚Äôt have Heavy metal
[2022-12-13 10:34:35] <!%+ajingus> I remember the intro to one of them made me go WOAH EDGY cus someone gets eaten in it
[2022-12-13 10:34:37] <%+Sandasty> I used to play time crisis
[2022-12-13 10:34:38] <%btsdm> underground 2 is one of the best games of all time, and has possibly the best soundtrack of any game
[2022-12-13 10:34:40] <%+Sandasty> absolute banger of a game
[2022-12-13 10:34:42] <%$Lysdexic9541> Sony had Ratchet & Clank and Jak & Daxter. EZ win

[2022-12-13 10:36:38] <%$Xyz39808> @ajingus the intro movie with Jurrassic5 is the GOAT
[2022-12-13 10:36:38] <%Redamaford> The arcade stuff was basically identical to the console, that was the selling point.
[2022-12-13 10:36:41] <$Darmanimon> Metal Slug is still one of my favorite series ever
[2022-12-13 10:36:43] <%Redamaford> You had an arcade machine at home
[2022-12-13 10:36:43] <superbizarr0> FeelsBadMan Bam fell on hard times

[2022-12-13 12:31:06] <@%ArthurAbbott> @maethra Yah the problem with using noise cancelation is that if your all over the place voice-wise its super noticeable when it cuts your voice off, or you hear like audio artifacting. Its why a lot of streamers go for sound dampening their actual rooms over using programs to fix the issues, and why you see so much dampening foam/acoustic panels in professional content creators recording spaces
[2022-12-13 12:31:26] <$Frozen_Hare> Bose has some nice geo based on ear buds

[2022-12-13 12:34:42] <@%ArthurAbbott> The fix genuinely is just for a Switch 2 to come out with better performance, but as long as people are still buying switches and games en-masse nintendo isn't incentivised to do anything at all

[2022-12-13 12:35:27] <%$reptilemower> bad take: marimari_en is a good streamer marimariSmug
[2022-12-13 12:35:37] <!%+ajingus> Minecraft is just okay and with ages is increasingly shallow
[2022-12-13 12:35:39] <%Fudgie_MD> Umineko is a literary masterpiece.

[2022-12-13 12:36:44] <!%+ajingus> hot take, most 3D models for vtubers aren't that good
[2022-12-13 12:36:45] <Cartmyah> corn > wheat
[2022-12-13 12:36:53] <chubbydoggoisgood> dogs > cats

[2022-12-13 12:37:22] <!%garfield1187> corn is definitely funnier
[2022-12-13 12:37:24] <%goombaroni> danHmm do you ever eat corn the long way?
[2022-12-13 12:37:25] <!%+ajingus> corn is top tier it lets me eat slop that kills my body
[2022-12-13 12:37:31] <%BLZbubs> @Nehymu i feel attacked
[2022-12-13 12:37:33] <$Frozen_Hare> Spanish rice sounds yummy now
[2022-12-13 12:37:35] <+maxstew7> yeah but rice without anything added doesnt taste as good as corn

[2022-12-13 12:37:55] <chubbydoggoisgood> How I see rice: on itself is meh, but as an addition rice is the best. Like you mix rice with so many things and you get a great meal
[2022-12-13 12:37:59] <!%+ajingus> that feels less primal than the other way to eat it though

[2022-12-13 13:04:05] <+maxstew7> fun fact, you're literally not allowed to eat burgers anything but well done. The meat is grounded up, so all the surface bacteria go inside. Only steaks you can eat medium or rare.
