Today my brilliant plans come to fruition. My Supreme Verdict is to cleanse the world in a wildfire! So watch as I destroy all the lands (except my own indestructible ones, of course) and saunter on to my well deserved victory with my artifacts! MWAHAHAA! You can join in my rule with a simple like, comment, sub, follow, or purchase from the Spikeling Store or sponsors.

[2022-12-20 17:22:28] <+tyler01924> actually ensouling a kaldra is pretty good

[2022-12-20 17:50:02] <%jpfeinberg> @aspiringspike people who are happy with your deck choice have no incentive to speak up, because you're already doing what they want
[2022-12-20 17:50:02] <%$theblazingbogle917> the brews are why I watch the stream
[2022-12-20 17:50:07] <%bjornwithit> I love the deck and the stream, here‚Äôs a lurker piping up with positivity
[2022-12-20 17:50:08] <YourBoyFuzzySlippers> you are an artist, and sometimes your audience rejects your art, that doesn't make it any less meaningful
[2022-12-20 17:50:11] <%joymonger> It‚Äôs your channel and it sucks that ppl just can‚Äôt keep their a-hole opinions to themselves rather than let you and others who like it enjoy
[2022-12-20 17:50:13] <+Jellomoose> I dunno about others, but 50% of the reason I come here is to see interesting brews. The other 50% is like "new take on established deck".
[2022-12-20 17:50:14] <%zack_fayden> they think your deck choice is something they can swipe to the next one like a tiktok video

[2022-12-20 18:13:57] <abackgroundguy> discords have too much garbage takes from paper only players IMO

[2022-12-20 18:14:03] <+rueler18> hammer discord is based for sure

[2022-12-20 18:14:06] <+bypster> I totally hear you about group think but the scales discord has a lot of people trying different things out with agreement that there is no best scales build

[2022-12-20 18:15:03] <%+HealthLoss> In the Jund discord does someone suggest a new card and then gets mauled because it wasn't part of 2014 Jund? xD
[2022-12-20 18:15:08] <+KoDiamonds> best be like abzan and not be popular enough to even have a discord Kappa
[2022-12-20 18:15:14] <%+kentsuki13> Yea, storm discord players all greed they are just junkies
[2022-12-20 18:15:15] <%SquidSquaaad> @rueler18 Taps for 2 colors, is painless, comes in untapped, and when scales players murder you its not by a fraction of 1 or 2 life if we need access to the colors
[2022-12-20 18:15:22] <%Owl_on_Caffeine> @aspiringspike Speaking of Discord groups, the Food Discord likes Teething Wurmlet in Gx Food decks due to it not being as weak as FTK to grave hate.  Thoughts?
[2022-12-20 18:15:22] <%dexagos> you should play a rw deck sometime this week to pair with the santa hat
[2022-12-20 18:15:26] <sambooch> Considering how many times I‚Äôve beat burn at 3 life with a RIP in play, I‚Äôm not surprised they undervalue lurrus
[2022-12-20 18:15:27] <%$Ocara115> @rueler18 Because the 3-4 life you might give your opponent doesn't matter because often times you are dealing a lot of overkill damage, or you are killing with infect
[2022-12-20 18:15:38] <%$Djfsappy> @loveandmushrooms just rember the cards i tried didnt work like it seemed like they would with that card
[2022-12-20 18:15:44] <lsoIating> I feel like ensouling and removing the saga is also fine
[2022-12-20 18:15:46] <+rueler18> @rueler18 but i am sure a % of the time that the 1 or 2 life does matter
[2022-12-20 18:15:58] <%loveandmushrooms> @Djfsappy hmm okay interesting, but i'd still ahve to know what they are to understand the point. But i'll keep an eye out

[2022-12-20 18:16:24] <%SquidSquaaad> @rueler18 Okay so what are you suggesting in place of it?
[2022-12-20 18:16:27] <+rueler18> copperline gorge seems better to me

[2022-12-20 18:16:47] <pointless56> do it! I would love to see scales content! not saying is bad, only limited testing weaker than mainnbuild but could use more steering for sure
[2022-12-20 18:16:52] <%+gankedbywife> they can move the counters to inkmoth
[2022-12-20 18:16:59] <TheTunnelingCat> what if you blast the ravager then dispatch the hangarback and leave the automaton
[2022-12-20 18:17:01] <%$Ocara115> @rueler18 The gorge entering tapped will matter more often than the extra life
[2022-12-20 18:17:06] <%bigjuicynaturalz> i love the pricepoint of this deck. the people's modern deck

[2022-12-20 18:17:14] <+NotSatanIPromise> @rueler18 the 1 or 2 does matter a % of the time but the damage from pain lands matters a higher % of the time
[2022-12-20 18:17:17] <%$Ocara115> It's not as big of an issue as it seems

[2022-12-20 18:18:23] <%nimz0witsch> @aspiringspike 100% agree, discord groups that focus on an archetype are full of bad player that are not accepting additions and changes to their archetype. Groups of grinders that are good all around players are way better to innovate and tune archetypes.

[2022-12-20 18:19:01] <Poco_the_turtle> kinda forget that grove can make colorless. that helps a ton

[2022-12-20 18:23:14] <NoochM> arena has legit 1 real format, standard. all the other are digital only
[2022-12-20 18:23:14] <rowrow_> arena is taking so much time *not* adding old cards/sets

[2022-12-20 18:23:44] <rowrow_> arena gets literally crumbs of cards from older sets to fill out Pioneer-Lite‚Ñ¢
[2022-12-20 18:23:45] <BoofTroupe> why get rid of the client that lets you see the stack?

[2022-12-20 18:28:42] <%Aquinas9> @BoofTroupe It's not about the animations - those are window dressing. MTGO's UI is extremely dated and you can tell. It should not take 25 clicks to cast a delve spell. The lag makes the software unsuable at times. The crashes during large tournaments are horrendous.
[2022-12-20 18:28:46] <%+slycroissant> Scales players have some of the worst luck. Last time I played one I was on a 5C Chord deck... with maindeck Ouphe

[2022-12-20 20:09:45] <%d0gula> Feels like standard rares are always kind of expensive
[2022-12-20 20:09:48] <@%phuckingmagikal> slower tournament time, people offloading for money for holidays, etc
[2022-12-20 20:09:48] <%+dravencorvinus> because confidence in wizards is way down and because there aren't weekly big paper events.  But that being said, i wasn't aware singles were tanking any more than usual since it's the holidays

[2022-12-20 20:14:26] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> Omnath though...
[2022-12-20 20:14:26] <@%+dizyranger> 2 years ago was december 2020 not spring of 2020
[2022-12-20 20:14:29] <+mattmanw2> As soon as they stopped with FIRE design
[2022-12-20 20:14:29] <%+RobSaidOtis> well thats more a bug, then card design

[2022-12-20 20:14:45] <%+RobSaidOtis> @RobSaidOtis well thats more of a bug then card design
[2022-12-20 20:14:48] <Doublexposure> I though khm had the most text ever, not that I don't love that set
[2022-12-20 20:14:50] <Poco_the_turtle> except the flip cards in kaldheim sure had words on them
[2022-12-20 20:14:50] [Notification] YungDingo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! [Another month of beefin ydingoSadge]
[2022-12-20 20:14:51] <%titanoclock> Last busted set was ikoria
[2022-12-20 20:14:57] <+Brodyman> i feel like streets of new capenna had too much text on cards
[2022-12-20 20:15:00] <Poco_the_turtle> Cosima bby
[2022-12-20 20:15:07] <%+UnholeySieve> have they publicly announced that FIRE is over?
[2022-12-20 20:15:16] <%titanoclock> Yes
[2022-12-20 20:15:24] <%titanoclock> In a ban announcement
[2022-12-20 20:15:27] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> MDFC lands!
[2022-12-20 20:15:27] <%+RobSaidOtis> fire? what does fire mean?
[2022-12-20 20:15:30] <%titanoclock> Like 2 years ago
[2022-12-20 20:15:30] <@%+hmmyespanda> iteration was banned before treasure cruise and dig in pioneer, so clearly strixhaven was overpowered Kappa
[2022-12-20 20:15:37] <pillageisking> FIRE means burning
[2022-12-20 20:15:49] <%+UnholeySieve> ah, cool. I can't read so I missed that
[2022-12-20 20:16:04] <NordicRest> Fucked, Irritating, Repetitive, Eww
[2022-12-20 20:16:09] <+NotSatanIPromise> other than omnath was there really anything bad in zendikar?
[2022-12-20 20:16:10] <%Thylian1> aspikeRun1 aspikeRun2 aspikeRun1 aspikeRun2
[2022-12-20 20:16:13] <frunkyman> we're out of that era?
[2022-12-20 20:16:15] <%+sinalco87> were Urzas Saga an Mirrodin that strong in the whole set or just certain insane bombs? I mean we banned a lot Throne cards and still the format is full of other Throne cards, the set is not just Oko and Once, it has so many design flaws
[2022-12-20 20:16:17] <WaitWaitDontKillMe> I think a big part of FIRE is "what if it also draws a card?"
[2022-12-20 20:16:17] <@%ManaCymbal> Cards still have a silly amount of text on them
[2022-12-20 20:16:20] <kaiseresc> strixhaven cards are disgusting in the amount of words.
[2022-12-20 20:16:22] <+ferrandynamo> Questing BEast

[2022-12-20 20:16:48] <%+greekjoegurt> or the "downside" is just that it's legendary
[2022-12-20 20:16:49] <Dillinger135> Wasn't FIRE mostly focused on Limited? And hasn't Limited been consistently better and more engaging?
[2022-12-20 20:16:49] <+mattmanw2> They just put all the fire design cards into modern horizons sets
[2022-12-20 20:16:50] <%SquidSquaaad> @sinalco87 That strong across a whole set. Go look at bans across MtG history
[2022-12-20 20:16:52] <+monowog> Frankly, I Reject. Eww
[2022-12-20 20:16:52] <+BallSoHardTV> Clear and distinct? Descartes?

[2022-12-20 20:17:11] <Arl4> fire design in one word? Ragavan?
[2022-12-20 20:17:22] <+W_Kawin> now uncommon cards have two paragraphs on them
[2022-12-20 20:17:32] <+Tonmber> fire design doesnt actually mean anything
[2022-12-20 20:17:32] <NordicRest> @Dillinger135 that was NWO, not fire
[2022-12-20 20:17:35] <@%+hmmyespanda> FIRE started with War of the Spark IIRC
[2022-12-20 20:17:35] <rowrow_> !explain fire
[2022-12-20 20:17:37] <YourBoyFuzzySlippers> ...design should be focused on limited always
[2022-12-20 20:17:39] <@%^MTGBot> The Purifying Fire is the second book in the "A Planeswalker Novel" series, this time focusing on Chandra Nalaar. It is written by Laura Resnick. It was... See The Purifying Fire: https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Purifying_Fire
[2022-12-20 20:17:39] <+FTwitchK> John Wick = FIRE Design confirmed
[2022-12-20 20:17:40] <@%+esqpoe> need that black source
[2022-12-20 20:17:41] <@%+esqpoe> let's good
[2022-12-20 20:17:41] <+Tonmber> its literally a buzzword
[2022-12-20 20:17:42] <%+greekjoegurt> the real fire design is the friends we made along the way
[2022-12-20 20:17:42] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> !addcom FIRE breaks out to: Cards I do not like and they should  Maro (FIRE)
[2022-12-20 20:17:42] <Dillinger135> New World Order?
[2022-12-20 20:17:42] <%+RobSaidOtis> is this the first time they have used a buzzword like that or was there a water deign phase?
[2022-12-20 20:17:49] <rowrow_> !explain F.I.R.E.

[2022-12-20 20:17:52] <rowrow_> anabelaMadSby
[2022-12-20 20:18:00] <Dillinger135> FIRE is a boogeyman though, I definitely agree.
[2022-12-20 20:18:00] <rowrow_> fun interest replayable exciting?
[2022-12-20 20:18:04] <rowrow_> interesting*
[2022-12-20 20:18:13] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @Dillinger135 The 'original' fire design, NWO was when they decided that complexity should be tied to rareity. Rares do more than uncommons, etc
[2022-12-20 20:18:14] <+theoldsteady> For me, it's adding the answer to the card's downside on the card itself. Adding Dash to Ragavan is a great example
[2022-12-20 20:18:20] <+oAgonyy> Just got here, how does path work? Those brackets are confusing
[2022-12-20 20:18:34] <rowrow_> @oAgonyy 3 mana destroy all 2 or less drops
[2022-12-20 20:18:36] VIEWERS: 1¬†471
[2022-12-20 20:18:40] <rowrow_> @oAgonyy overload it to make it destroy all creatures
[2022-12-20 20:18:45] <%+RobSaidOtis> @oAgonyy its just kicker
[2022-12-20 20:18:46] <Dillinger135> @FourDogsInAHorseSuit Isn't that the opposite of what they've been doing lately though? That's what I was referencing, which I thought was the primary focus of FIRE
[2022-12-20 20:18:47] <keldec> @aspiringspike Why not Culling Ritual over Path of Peril? One turn later, but it hits everything that matters like Aid and Hammer
[2022-12-20 20:18:48] <Musteval> yeah cleave is one of the weirdest versions of kicker theyve ever printed
[2022-12-20 20:18:54] <NordicRest> @oAgonyy if you pay the cleave cost, ignore what's in the brackets
[2022-12-20 20:19:00] <+Golld> -1 cause gaze gets exiled
[2022-12-20 20:19:00] <rowrow_> cleave is a lot closer to overload than kicker
[2022-12-20 20:19:04] <%+Hawkfeather__> any cleavers in chat?
[2022-12-20 20:19:06] <Klossi815> mismatch art thopters D:
[2022-12-20 20:19:06] <+oAgonyy> Ohhhhh okay so it becomes a board wipe
[2022-12-20 20:19:07] <%+Banebot> !er cleave
[2022-12-20 20:19:07] <@%^MTGBot> This is a mod only command.
[2022-12-20 20:19:17] <Musteval> @rowrow_ overload is kicker tho
[2022-12-20 20:19:20] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @Dillinger135 What do you mean? Commons are still the cards with the least text and mythics the ones with the most.
[2022-12-20 20:19:28] <+monowog> Darnation
[2022-12-20 20:19:33] <%+RobSaidOtis> everything is kicker one way or another
[2022-12-20 20:19:51] <rowrow_> @Musteval overload and cleave are sub categories of kicker, but at a fundamental level do the same thing
[2022-12-20 20:19:51] <Dillinger135> But the complexity has been increasing. And it's not a hard and fast rule either because there are certainly more complex uncommons compared to cards like Sheoldred
[2022-12-20 20:20:11] <rowrow_> "Do worse effect, or overload for stronger effect"
[2022-12-20 20:20:19] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> They would've won last turn if they had a hammer
[2022-12-20 20:20:31] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> WHAT

[2022-12-20 20:20:59] <+NotSatanIPromise> smartest hammer player
[2022-12-20 20:21:06] <keldec> Why not Culling Ritual over Path of Peril? One turn later, but it hits everything that matters like Aid and Hammer. Plus the mana can be really good

[2022-12-20 20:32:30] <Bubblegumption> People love pulling out dice and putting them on cards. Gives them the chance to spend too much money on fancy d6s

[2022-12-20 20:35:07] <!don_azucar> !suggest fire prophecy
[2022-12-20 20:35:10] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card fire prophecy. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is fire prophecy. Thank You.
