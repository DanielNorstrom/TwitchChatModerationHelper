[2022-12-17 00:00:10] <%Keystone4274> Saw a clip of hog hook is bugged sometimes it has no animation
[2022-12-17 00:00:11] <%ayoitsjaymundo> I’m surprised you’re not playing hog
[2022-12-17 00:00:20] <frostyninja12123456> How much longer is hanzo gonna be bugged
[2022-12-17 00:00:24] <%+lazorbheemz> @emann444 it does enhance custom games

[2022-12-17 00:00:37] <gappyspins> ANOTHER HOG SO FUN
[2022-12-17 00:00:38] <%+DTOWN_1590> THey should just say they are removing hog for a rework but instead of reworking him just never put him back in the game
[2022-12-17 00:00:39] <+IsolatedPhoenix> half ur health boom
[2022-12-17 00:00:42] <tjxxd> Same hog?

[2022-12-17 00:01:30] <+CampeDiem> @Jayraaaaaa I think it's 7 seconds. Maybe 8.
[2022-12-17 00:01:34] <xShroomies> honestly they just need to make it so  that if hog misses a hook he just dies

[2022-12-17 00:51:47] <FOXYOURKILLCAM> the ping system isnt very good though. Like example. Im on point trying to ping a door and it keeps pinging to push the point
[2022-12-17 00:51:48] <Graf3X> yeap, ping is a god send for not wanting to see the bs that is.... society
[2022-12-17 00:51:48] <%swampboss666> it's sad when people dont look at the ping :(

[2022-12-17 00:51:57] <mingyver> i wish the ping system was easier to use on console tho ):
[2022-12-17 00:51:59] <human574> it gets worse
[2022-12-17 00:51:59] <%Ocara115> Id rather deal with OW comms instead of Warzone
[2022-12-17 00:52:01] <+VertSupport> make roadhog breather apply shields that dissolve rather than a heal. this way it adds risk for the hog to decide to retreat or reach for the kill
[2022-12-17 00:52:02] <bird_bebop> What upppp
[2022-12-17 00:52:02] <Graf3X> it's no where near what cs used to be
[2022-12-17 00:52:02] <%paddingtonnnn> it is ABSOLUTELY not as bad
[2022-12-17 00:52:02] <+poopoopeepeeboii> Yeah OW is much better than like every game
[2022-12-17 00:52:04] <+kaebear> i agree i think the ping system is great. and i am glad they implemented it.
[2022-12-17 00:52:06] <mengg96> I wait first and see how they act, then start talking if they seem kind. Best solution for me and it works
[2022-12-17 00:52:08] <crankie66> What do I do if I’m hardstuck bronze, my diamond friend said I would be much higher if it wasn’t for my teammates

[2022-12-17 00:52:13] <heychuall> its gotten better than it used to be. at least you can pick a character and die before people tell you to change

[2022-12-17 00:52:31] <rktwobbuffet> My only ping tip is use "I need help" instead of pinging an enemy diving you, usually gets an actual response from team

But still it isn’t fun to be focused and forced to play hog for quality of life. Hopefully giga chad Ramatra is a bit better, but Honestly until hog nerfs and even after he still gets blown up.

[2022-12-17 01:35:53] <+GorillaGripGibby> So much visual clutter right there
[2022-12-17 01:35:53] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-17 02:47:15] <TunaMuna27> ever since the sr reset (and mmr i would guess) in season 2 i, as a mid-diamond player, get in matches where my enemy tank is masters and a healer who was top 500 last season. so my question is @Flats have you ever since the sr reset of season 2 met an abnormal amount of diamond players?

[2022-12-17 03:16:23] <4Zalasar> You gotta ego diff then Flats
[2022-12-17 03:16:25] <talon824> @nickd714 It’s a LOT faster. Just because turn speed and accuracy don’t have as much of a trade off compared to console
[2022-12-17 03:16:27] <OscarZuluTV> What rank is Flats (new to stream)
[2022-12-17 03:16:28] <%IrZKuma> @nickd714 you just gotta get the hang of the different control scheme and the differences to play they enable. you will be able to apply what you know from console when you are more comfortable
[2022-12-17 03:16:32] <%+wolff213> @poppa_koala yea but same time they need to talk to all console devolpers to get approved the patch they cant just throw one out
[2022-12-17 03:16:36] <%epicscout700> cause they won the clone match, that means your the tank diff clearly
