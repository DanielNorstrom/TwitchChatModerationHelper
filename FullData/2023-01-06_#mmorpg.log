[2023-01-06 13:12:28] <%Lasuuri> So.. Good friend of mine scammed me.. He owed me 45€ and needed more money last Friday so I loaned 40€. Now always when I asked when he will pay he said that he doesn't know. Yesterday I told him that I need the money or even part of the money right now. He blocked me..

[2023-01-06 19:19:11] <chrisflorens> my runescape account of 10 years was banned due to someone hacking it and botting on it. I've just sent an appeal to get the email back and then hopefully to appeal the ban. This is like the worst thing i've ever thought could happen. And my phone still has authenticator on so i don't even know how anyone managed to log into it.
