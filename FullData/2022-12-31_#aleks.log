[2022-12-31 05:05:05] <%kiba592> Why not just charge a service fee and pay them more
[2022-12-31 05:05:06] <@%Tingy> LMAO Twitch broke
[2022-12-31 05:05:13] <%+RoliFromMars> it’s businesses that use the customer to also contribute directly to the workers’ pay rather than the business paying them fairly

[2022-12-31 05:05:42] <lilcarkeys> auto grat is horrible for servers bc it makes ppl not want to tip more than 15-20
[2022-12-31 05:05:45] <markkikko> When you get bottle service, tip is already included in the bill but they don’t tell you, so you get okayed and tip some more…
[2022-12-31 05:05:45] <laaye> I bought ice cream and he pulled it pre-wrapped out of the freezer and gave it to me and the iPad asked for 18% minimum
[2022-12-31 05:05:45] <!%atlas_is_tipsy> yeah built in gratuity

[2022-12-31 05:05:56] <+kylethehoss> other countries are laughing at our tipping charges
[2022-12-31 05:06:01] <Gorilla_Jones_II> what doesn't make sense is that EVERY server expects at least 15-20% of the bill, when I'd say 3/5 servers could care less about their level of service
[2022-12-31 05:06:05] <%ayoggeorge> When i was 14 i worked coat check for tips in a restaurant  downtown
[2022-12-31 05:06:06] <!%MadelineSpoon> just pay people fair wages

[2022-12-31 05:06:10] <%+mangofloatx> @aleks the debate is that should people tip even though its for takeout, which we kinda do here in Canada
[2022-12-31 05:06:17] <lilcarkeys> auto grat sucks for both sides
[2022-12-31 05:06:26] <boolove> especially with expensive alchohol @aleks they put the bottle on the table and leave
[2022-12-31 05:06:35] <@%Tingy> @mangofloatx Bro, subway now asks for tip. fuck that

[2022-12-31 05:06:58] <%YoJYT> most places in the usa dont want to pay fair wages they want the customer to be the one who pays them at least thats how it is where i work
[2022-12-31 05:06:59] <!%GopnikMedic> I honestly dont know whats harder. Getting rich or staying rich

[2022-12-31 05:07:02] <%luxhoney> i hate the restaurants that split the tip money between all waiters rather than giving it to the person who earned it

[2022-12-31 05:07:47] <markkikko> They should be tipping me
[2022-12-31 05:07:47] <%YoJYT> its just the company not wanting to pay the workers better
