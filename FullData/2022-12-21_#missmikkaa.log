[2022-12-21 16:27:24] <%brianthebroken85> I found this game harder than previous Souls games until Godrick...after that things suddenly got easier for me.
[2022-12-21 16:27:24] <!%bmap72> damn
[2022-12-21 16:27:26] <TheRealEttorino> this is so insane, I really love it *__*
[2022-12-21 16:27:42] <+tacticalslayer134> yo, is she insane. I've never seen gaming at this peak level before wtf
[2022-12-21 16:27:59] <@%Radolov> Rolling into him and an attack will cause him to go aggressive I think
[2022-12-21 16:28:00] <TheRealEttorino> @tacticalslayer134 indeed
[2022-12-21 16:28:01] <DeathSlayer52006> @freeskill2020 I agreed, don't think you never seen other streamer does multi tasking like this
[2022-12-21 16:28:06] <Zebukiel> I thought endure was just a buff, do you have to hit them or something?

[2022-12-21 16:28:37] <%brianthebroken85> yes, careful of saying anything critical of Elden Ring...MissMikkaa can get very defensive...lol.
[2022-12-21 16:28:38] <dezorys> impressive what you're doing here ! goodluck
[2022-12-21 16:28:41] <@%Radolov> @Zebukiel Its hyper armor + damage reduction. Otherwise he would just stagger with every hit, and dodging on both can have a hard time to time it
[2022-12-21 16:28:41] <%PeterParler> @DeathSlayer52006 I concur, this is next level and she has a great personality! Perfect mix.

[2022-12-21 16:29:32] <DeathSlayer52006> @PeterParler totally agreed on that to. even attempting this on dancepad thats something I can't do lol
[2022-12-21 16:29:33] <%yummy_n0udles> yeah that was odd
[2022-12-21 16:29:35] <%AverageFlo> @MissMikkaa what do you think is the hardest soulsgame in your opinion??

[2022-12-21 16:31:58] <+Dreadwolf777> Bloodborne is hardest because 30 fps
[2022-12-21 16:31:59] <%AverageFlo> from diffficulty standpoint
[2022-12-21 16:31:59] <@%Radolov> @bmap72 she'll kill him in 3min
[2022-12-21 16:32:06] <%brianthebroken85> I think I found DS2 the hardest,..but maybe because that game was my first FromSoft experience.

[2022-12-21 17:33:21] <nexonend> flame of the redmains, stagger that one enemy and abuse the immunity to fall down that is probably the easiest way
[2022-12-21 17:33:41] <!%bmap72> aaawww
[2022-12-21 17:33:41] <%h_filmbert> It's really interesting that the worst boss until now has been parkouring.
[2022-12-21 17:33:44] <!%bmap72> so close
[2022-12-21 17:33:50] <Emonea> isnt this way harder with armor KEKW
[2022-12-21 17:33:59] <strawberryapplepear> just jerk violently backward
[2022-12-21 17:34:08] <%dangerousfella> i had a feeling this area would cause some grief, so much extra micro adjustments with that dance pad
[2022-12-21 17:34:09] <@%Radolov> @Emonea not really, backsteps are pretty powerful
[2022-12-21 17:34:11] <!%+AnGGelala> @MissMikkaa DMs pretty please when you have a minute mikkaaGG
[2022-12-21 17:34:14] <h4rdcoremango> I think if you say 'parkour' every time you drop it'll be fine

[2022-12-21 19:51:08] <%oweknow3> For my money, DS3 is the best "Souls-style" game of the trilogy plus Elden Ring.
[2022-12-21 19:51:10] <%Bmoney159> Yup, it was a fun short game with that kind of sense of humor. Just an idea for ya
[2022-12-21 19:51:16] <%pvaia> oh Toussaint is the best
[2022-12-21 19:51:16] <%+Hugo_rndj> i think yes maybe
[2022-12-21 19:51:18] <microchipzombie> They give you a save for the DLC if you want to skip MQ

[2022-12-21 20:32:31] <+Dr_Anth0ny_Fauci> I think you should try to stay in phase 1 on PS5 and try to beat Melania on dance pad first and then focus on controller or is that not allowed

[2022-12-21 20:33:07] <%RegentOfOrigin> I originally estimated three weeks, but I think you're gonna beat that by a few days
[2022-12-21 20:33:10] <marmeladenbeer> Melania is super annoying on dance pad i think

[2022-12-21 20:37:27] <UncleCalus> I hope this doesnt sound rude, its just feedback but is there any reason as to why the left side of the screen with your bits/subs takes up so much space, it would be nice for it to be a bit smaller so that the two playthroughs are a bit more visible.
