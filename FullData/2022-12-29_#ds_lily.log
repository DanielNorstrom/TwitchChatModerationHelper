[2022-12-29 01:01:14] <%Gallatyn> @gatorfu youtube search Roger Waters Mother.  It came up first for me.  He even has Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of Lucius doing some harmonizing vocals in it.  Look it up and see if it's what you're talking about.  All of the musicians appear to be in different places and it looks to be live. :)
[2022-12-29 01:01:40] <gatorfu> that's really awesome but they probably had special treatment because they're millionaire musicians like direct lines of some sort of some s***
[2022-12-29 01:01:54] <gatorfu> but I'm going to look it up and I appreciate the information maybe they have enough speed on the grid now maybe CERN has updated it
