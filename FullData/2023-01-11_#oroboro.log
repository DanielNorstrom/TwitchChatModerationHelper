[2023-01-11 04:53:52] <%Evil_on_Paper> @Oroboro You may have to do this without bullgoat talisman for rounding
[2023-01-11 04:53:53] <Nomad_Kane> 83 and switch to a lighter helm would do it.

[2023-01-11 04:55:34] <%Evil_on_Paper> It is 100% the bullgoat talisman

[2023-01-11 04:56:04] <MatraTheEternal> You can't get 82 due to the talisman.

[2023-01-11 04:58:38] <@%Peeve> you get hit by Moonveil? pvpKing that explains a lot, get more poise, actually
[2023-01-11 04:58:54] <Nomad_Kane> 89 for small thrusting sword 2hr1x2 or 2hr2 is an important breakpoint too.

[2023-01-11 05:00:23] <cold_coffee0> 89 is the next breakpoint then 101
[2023-01-11 05:00:26] <$xSleeplessNightsx> Tbh Oro is more likely to moonveil then peeve

[2023-01-11 05:02:16] <Nomad_Kane> 89 is my favorite breakpoint right now. It's specifically for small thrusting swords though. People tend to pull those out when they think they're going to lose.
[2023-01-11 05:02:22] <cold_coffee0> if you go for 87 you might as well hit 89 or just stay at 76. hitting 101 to tank flame strike and storm stomp is nice tho
[2023-01-11 05:02:25] <miaushe> 61x133%=81,33 and 62x133%=82,67

[2023-01-11 05:02:42] <miaushe> so 62 should give u 82 poise

[2023-01-11 05:02:59] <Nomad_Kane> 89 is enough with bullgoats on.
[2023-01-11 05:02:59] <%anom96> a perfumer build would be cool

[2023-01-11 05:10:54] <Nomad_Kane> Is that better than getting rid of the erdtree talisman and using a 5 stat talisman, though?

[2023-01-11 06:19:10] <Nomad_Kane> I blame fromsoft to some extent because vigor gives low returns at low levels. I imagine people look at the gains and decide it's not worth it.

[2023-01-11 06:20:12] <KelsoTabasco> Yeah it's massive until 40+
[2023-01-11 06:20:12] <rockmih> The problem is not vigor damage values are just too big in ER
[2023-01-11 06:20:12] <Shadow04> I guess people don't want to trade damage for vigor
[2023-01-11 06:20:13] <%Evil_on_Paper> Vigor doesn't start to look appealing until like 20
[2023-01-11 06:20:17] <Qwozle> maybe it's just that everything else is so good
[2023-01-11 06:20:21] <Shadow04> But most of the time it's worth it imo
[2023-01-11 06:20:27] <%filthycasual62> @noob_almost agreed, even if you go 99 strength you still have something left over for vigor
[2023-01-11 06:20:30] <%Evil_on_Paper> before that it's like, 20ish HP, then jumps to 30 HP at 19 to 20
[2023-01-11 06:20:42] <%anom96> don't they get tired of getting two shot? lol
[2023-01-11 06:20:48] <%+Batgame88> You would think if that was the logic, they would realize pumping damage stats doesn't do shit until you get some upgrade levels on the weapons

[2023-01-11 06:21:06] <%Evil_on_Paper> People figure the soreseal + godrick's rune for +10 vigor is "enough"
[2023-01-11 06:21:16] <@%$Pallydan9K> @Lilguyfinish that's what I was assuming people were doing
[2023-01-11 06:21:19] <%anom96> you gotta pump those vigor numbers up
[2023-01-11 06:21:24] <FPG_29> L2 the game
[2023-01-11 06:21:26] <%filthycasual62> I honestly don’t level vigor much till about level 60. Even then by 90 it’s only like 40
[2023-01-11 06:21:29] <%anom96> those are rookie numbers
[2023-01-11 06:21:29] <Raymond_McL> You're pretending if you think they are paying attention to that. "Hey, cool new sword, guess I'll level to use that" is the extent of thought
[2023-01-11 06:21:37] <%+reaperscythe25> It's a common misunderstanding that vigor is useless because they think things one shot you regardless of your health
[2023-01-11 06:21:39] <Lilguyfinish> @Pallydan9K it makes the most sense to me. Only reason I can think of with how many levels you get in elden
[2023-01-11 06:21:44] <Nomad_Kane> @frolobaggins Because the the swords hit at the same time and have longer reach and have a way better jump attack. Most people don't know the cs l1 is faster though so it will win the trade.

[2023-01-11 06:50:31] <+cloud4112239> I hate Scarlett rot..
[2023-01-11 06:50:38] <%filthycasual62> @mohl97 that’s several strands of idiocy
[2023-01-11 06:50:42] <MadMarmot_> Does it still work with deathblight?
[2023-01-11 06:50:45] <vida35> 1 years and it's still in
[2023-01-11 06:50:46] <val_draconis> they patched specifically the deathblight variant of the sin exploit
[2023-01-11 06:50:46] <Salria> time to do what you did with dragonbreath and just use it untill they fix it I guess Kappa
[2023-01-11 06:50:47] <godless_seraph> feature, not a bug syndrome?
[2023-01-11 06:50:50] <%anom96> what an announcement Brandon
[2023-01-11 06:50:52] <@%$Pallydan9K> @MadMarmot_ no
[2023-01-11 06:50:52] <threothree> Ran into one yesterday or the day before, managed to bait them to a boss and get the host killed so yay me
[2023-01-11 06:51:00] <MadMarmot_> thank god
[2023-01-11 06:51:00] <TheRealWholehorse> Elden Ring on pc had a lot of hackers earlier on, but most of the stuff you could do with cheatengine doesn't work anymore.
[2023-01-11 06:51:08] <@%$Pallydan9K> fire's deadly sin specifically works with blackflame blade, bloodflame blade, chilling mist, and poisonous mist
[2023-01-11 06:51:12] <%+HollowYourself> oroLUL i never get tired of seeing people try to kill you in your spawning I-frames
[2023-01-11 06:51:12] <+paipai314> people still attack during spawning in 2023

[2023-01-11 06:52:23] <TheRealWholehorse> chaincasting was a glitch. ign build is a feature.
[2023-01-11 06:52:27] <ChunLi_in_ThighHighs> they dont want to make IGN cry
[2023-01-11 06:52:27] <Tybug0rz> honestly gues, guess what? Chicken butt !!! XDDD
[2023-01-11 06:52:30] <val_draconis> they patched the deathblight bug Oro thats totally the only issue with that spell and nothing else
[2023-01-11 06:52:45] <%the_musko> lol
[2023-01-11 06:52:46] <!%$Mohl97> seriously though there's like no cheaters on PC, between the main hacking discord deciding "yeah we don't want to encourage online cheating anymore" after shit in DS3 and elden ring implementing most of blue sentinel into it on top of EAC acting as a lock

[2023-01-11 06:53:01] <%+HollowYourself> @yureikvlt my headcanon is gankers are all either failed invaders or super angry single-players who got invaded one too many times and snapped, so this is pretty accurate

[2023-01-11 07:32:17] <%Zatharax__> Invasions at 50 are pretty solid, nobody has great damage unless they're unscaled so you get to actually make 1 or 2 mistakes without being oneshot if you do it right

[2023-01-11 07:41:44] <@%$Pallydan9K> I would argue that you can't have a valid opinion unless you can see the quality of every souls game
[2023-01-11 07:41:46] <%Honako> @Ebonslayer Not really in a game like Souls. People aren't even the same level in invasions. Games are way to asymmetrical

[2023-01-11 07:42:34] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax Then you never tried the PVP, and thus have an invalid view.
[2023-01-11 07:42:40] <%Honako> Invaders can't heal in dks2, there's seed of a giant, soul memory means player levels are all over the map. It's fine to like dks2, but it's not objective
[2023-01-11 07:42:41] <%KungFuAndrew> @Senyax DS2's parry is silly, but I find the rest of the game to feel very smooth.
[2023-01-11 07:42:49] <RehlarVahra> @filthycasual62 he was feline very well :<
[2023-01-11 07:42:52] <DankerousMan> don't care, didn't ask
[2023-01-11 07:43:06] <%yogurt_the_succulent_chef> ds2 was a balanced piece of dookie more like it weirdChamp
[2023-01-11 07:43:19] <TheRealWholehorse> Soul memory was a mistake, but there was nothing wrong with the gameplay.

[2023-01-11 07:43:31] <%filthycasual62> @rehlarvahra I don’t feline so good Mr. Stark. I don’t wanna go, don’t let me go.
[2023-01-11 07:43:32] <%Honako> I don't have a favorite Souls PvP game. I just enjoy the series. But it's just wrong to act like any of them are objectively better.

[2023-01-11 07:43:44] <!%Ebonslayer> DS2 supported the greatest amount of player skill and had the highest balance.
[2023-01-11 07:43:50] <%Zatharax__> Slashy Souls best souls
[2023-01-11 07:43:53] <@%$Pallydan9K> DS2 has feints
[2023-01-11 07:43:56] <%Honako> There's way to many BS systems in these games for any of it to be objective or esports etc
[2023-01-11 07:43:57] <Ann_Sam> sure more interesting than ds3 invasions
[2023-01-11 07:43:58] <Nomad_Kane> That weapon art is actually good... sometimes.
[2023-01-11 07:43:59] <%filthycasual62> So the Giants Locks are good! I’ve been told they’re crap!
[2023-01-11 07:44:13] <%KungFuAndrew> DS2 had a hard counter to pretty much any tactic, and it wasn't always tied to just having a spear in your pocket
[2023-01-11 07:44:14] <RehlarVahra> @filthycasual62 RIP Spider-Cat NotLikeThis
[2023-01-11 07:44:14] <the_RAINMANN> @PickledSosig innovative in poor design sure
[2023-01-11 07:44:15] <@%$Pallydan9K> Personally I dislike ds3 the most
[2023-01-11 07:44:18] <%Honako> All the skill with seed of a giant and level 70 invaded level 40s OMEGALUL
[2023-01-11 07:44:20] <%KungFuAndrew> I love science
[2023-01-11 07:44:23] <ArmoredTroll> Apart from soul memory DS2 is amazing game

[2023-01-11 07:44:47] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax You played it for 2 days. That's not enough to get a grasp on all the mechanics.
[2023-01-11 07:44:50] <thamandalor> i could never find an invasion in ds3
[2023-01-11 07:44:52] <soulname13> @ArmoredTroll and ghost rang/bad hit box tho
[2023-01-11 07:44:56] <spacecowboy_1> Hey chat
[2023-01-11 07:44:57] <%filthycasual62> @rehlarvahra not a big loss, he kept knocking stuff off the counter for no reason
[2023-01-11 07:45:19] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax If someone played your DS3 for 2 days and called it bad would you consider them valid?
[2023-01-11 07:45:46] <ArmoredTroll> @ArmoredTroll Ghost range was kinda bullshit sometimes true
[2023-01-11 07:45:50] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer DS2 gameplay was too poor to support player skill
[2023-01-11 07:45:57] <%Zatharax__> I'm surprised that the ruin sword even has a thrust
[2023-01-11 07:46:03] <!%Ebonslayer> @ArmoredTroll Every DS game had ghost hitboxes.
[2023-01-11 07:46:03] <Nomad_Kane> Once they start sliding my anxiety starts rising.
[2023-01-11 07:46:08] <DankerousMan> honestly at this point I'll say soul memory was based just to piss off ds3 fans thehap43Laugh
[2023-01-11 07:46:16] <Senyax> @Ebonslayer what not fun is just not fun dont matter how well i know the mechanics i had like 2k hours in dks1 and 2 was not for me
[2023-01-11 07:46:21] <%filthycasual62> Speaking of giants locks, can we just talk about how the giants true faces beard is just ball hair? Like wtf?

[2023-01-11 07:46:40] <Senyax> @Ebonslayer ok so is dks 3 close to 1 or no ?

[2023-01-11 07:46:51] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax Close in what fashion?
[2023-01-11 07:46:54] <@%$Pallydan9K> ds3 doesn't have poise so it's more like demon's souls
[2023-01-11 07:46:56] <%Honako> ALL of these games asymmetrical and unbalanced AF. Just play what you like
[2023-01-11 07:46:56] <Ann_Sam> if someone kissed you for 2 days and called it bad.  are you a virgin?
[2023-01-11 07:46:57] <%KungFuAndrew> DS2 PvP arguments are inevitable
[2023-01-11 07:46:58] <%Zatharax__> @Honako Because if people don't agree with me they're dumb because I'm smart and always right
[2023-01-11 07:47:04] <%filthycasual62> @oroboro no, you started a WAR!!!!
[2023-01-11 07:47:06] <nazarbaayev> ds2 felt like a rip off of a souls game
[2023-01-11 07:47:06] <%Scarecrow2530> It's pretty good, too damn hot in Australia at the moment. How are you going man?

[2023-01-11 07:47:24] <@%$Pallydan9K> ds3 literally has Andre in it
[2023-01-11 07:47:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev DS3 was literally DS1 fanservice.
[2023-01-11 07:47:28] <%+KillerPandaKillingSpree> did that night comet build you were working on ever go anywhere?
[2023-01-11 07:47:29] <%+zebrah95> yes dragon bolt build!!

[2023-01-11 07:48:05] <%filthycasual62> @ebonslayer pretty sure ds3 was the direct continuation of ds1, cause those are the two From made
[2023-01-11 07:48:10] <%Honako> dks2 haters ignore the good points. dks2 fanboys ignore the flaws. Just another day 😃
[2023-01-11 07:48:11] <thamandalor> bloodborne smells
[2023-01-11 07:48:12] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax DS1 and DS3 feel different in some ways, similar in others. Overall gameplay is different.
[2023-01-11 07:48:14] <%Nirouku01> I thought this was a hades stream.
[2023-01-11 07:48:15] <DankerousMan> ds3 is the best at being bad
[2023-01-11 07:48:15] <nazarbaayev> ds2 was basically ds1 fan service done poorly
[2023-01-11 07:48:16] <%Zatharax__> Nah I like the idea that even though so much time has passed between 1 and 3 that shit is still the same because the unnatural extension of the Age Of Fire has locked things into an endless cycle
[2023-01-11 07:48:19] <!%Ebonslayer> @filthycasual62 Fromsoft made DS2 as well.
[2023-01-11 07:48:19] <Wake_Up_EX_Bird> Well one things for sure Ds2 is the most controversial one. So many strong feelings of pple either defending it or shitting on it

[2023-01-11 07:49:16] <+doodlemansketch> ds1 most nostalgia, ds2 got me into pvp, ds3 had fun getting friends into souls, elden ring masterpiece

[2023-01-11 07:49:27] <%Zatharax__> @soulname13 Yui Tanimura is the only reason that Ds2 was even released, he was handed a horribly mismanaged and mangled project and did his best to fix it
[2023-01-11 07:49:30] <!$Eric4bz> whips messed with so many people
[2023-01-11 07:49:33] <%Honako> Honestly all of the games have some pretty insane flaws.
[2023-01-11 07:49:35] <Senyax> better invasions ?

[2023-01-11 07:52:48] <Tetsaiga> Barrier of Stupid
[2023-01-11 07:52:49] <ハクア (harqua)> the barrier is made of gold
[2023-01-11 07:52:50] <Senyax> this old man weirdChamp
[2023-01-11 07:52:51] <$SirJoshua17> do you use +8 or +9 weapons for level 90 invasions?
[2023-01-11 07:52:52] <Nomad_Kane> I just gall it GMB
[2023-01-11 07:52:54] <RehlarVahra> @Senyax He believed in the falchion, and that was enuff
[2023-01-11 07:52:58] <RorBoy> The Great Barrier Buff
[2023-01-11 07:52:58] <DankerousMan> it's thematic
[2023-01-11 07:52:59] <RehlarVahra> also R1 spam LuL
[2023-01-11 07:53:01] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer i said they *tried* to make ds2 have a similar feel to ds1 but failed, so yes it ended up different
[2023-01-11 07:53:05] <+doodlemansketch> your holy
[2023-01-11 07:53:07] <nazarbaayev> thats what i mean
[2023-01-11 07:53:16] <%filthycasual62> @kungfuandrew meh, didn’t feel like dark souls when I first played it. It only felt that way after coming back years later
[2023-01-11 07:53:18] <codysnuts_> just been running invasions and seen more people with the Ruins greatsword than ever before, weird
[2023-01-11 07:53:22] <nightwings28> barrier of i have to use
[2023-01-11 07:53:22] <soulname13> @nazarbaayev at that points we can say all have they common root with dm's titavOld
[2023-01-11 07:53:23] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer also, no, bb is way different lol
[2023-01-11 07:53:28] <%hypejodye> Barrier of gold is golden order themed to protect against magic/caria
[2023-01-11 07:53:31] <TheDreadNine> because its the barriar for those who follow the Golden order?
[2023-01-11 07:53:31] <Senyax> @RehlarVahra you know that build dont slide against good players
[2023-01-11 07:53:36] <%KungFuAndrew> Apparently you can make gold turn blue by adding Indium.
[2023-01-11 07:53:38] <DankerousMan> same
[2023-01-11 07:53:40] <nazarbaayev> @soulname13 yea in a way
[2023-01-11 07:53:43] <@%$Pallydan9K> you hate how it's so optimal and there's no other choice?
[2023-01-11 07:53:44] <biowrecked> SwiftRage
[2023-01-11 07:53:45] <%$Noob_Almost> are you allowed to say that?
[2023-01-11 07:53:49] <%Zatharax__> Vagabond set with Traveler Hat is based
[2023-01-11 07:53:49] <Senyax> i saw him duels once boy it was funny
[2023-01-11 07:53:52] <soulname13> the manga or the classe ?
[2023-01-11 07:53:52] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev They obviously did intend for it to be different. Look at how slow and methodical the gameplay is, the animations being notably slower. Hell, the deeper gameplay mechanics like consecutive roll cost.
[2023-01-11 07:53:53] <Tetsaiga> Vagabond loves you though
[2023-01-11 07:53:54] <%filthycasual62> What’s wrong with vagabond?
[2023-01-11 07:53:57] <6Bear6Knight6> Vagabond is a great manga
[2023-01-11 07:53:57] <%Honako> But his a cool knight dude :/
[2023-01-11 07:54:02] <Nomad_Kane> My wing of astel build uses prisoner.
[2023-01-11 07:54:05] <ElSolRacNauj> What about Arcane builds? Kappa
[2023-01-11 07:54:07] <DankerousMan> wretch life
[2023-01-11 07:54:07] <6Bear6Knight6> oroCake
[2023-01-11 07:54:09] <%KungFuAndrew> Vagabond needs to straighten out his hat LUL
[2023-01-11 07:54:14] <PickledSosig> its the best for people who like swinging weapons
[2023-01-11 07:54:17] <Raymond_McL> Arc builds get to be Hero
[2023-01-11 07:54:17] <Shadow04> At least vagabond starts off with decent weapons
[2023-01-11 07:54:18] <atomicjest> @nazarbaayev source? it came to me in a dream
[2023-01-11 07:54:22] <RehlarVahra> @Senyax LOL, true it was definitely best for random invasions
[2023-01-11 07:54:22] <%Zatharax__> Vagabond and Astrologer are the only starting classes for PVP
[2023-01-11 07:54:23] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer you say its methodical i say its just clunky
[2023-01-11 07:54:27] <TheDreadNine> it goes vagabond, prisoner, prophet depending on the build
[2023-01-11 07:54:29] <%Zatharax__> Maaaybe Prophet if you're a weirdo
[2023-01-11 07:54:30] VIEWERS: 873

[2023-01-11 07:54:43] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer but it does seem to me they wanted it to have a similar feel
[2023-01-11 07:54:43] <+mechrome> so wretch no good??
[2023-01-11 07:54:46] <%filthycasual62> @zatharax__ hi, I’m weirdo
[2023-01-11 07:54:47] <Shadow04> I started with Hero on my 90 build, used Battle Axe and hated it
[2023-01-11 07:54:50] <nightwings28> 99 str kek
[2023-01-11 07:54:50] <Tetsaiga> Now, return this build
[2023-01-11 07:54:51] <%Zatharax__> You only need 66 cause two handing makes it 99 lol
[2023-01-11 07:54:52] <+TyrantThanatos> unga bunga time?
[2023-01-11 07:54:54] <@%$Pallydan9K> wretch is only optimal for specific builds
[2023-01-11 07:54:58] <%$Noob_Almost> needs more str
[2023-01-11 07:54:59] <@%$Pallydan9K> those builds usually suck
[2023-01-11 07:55:01] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Call it whatever you want, one thing is true: DS2 greatly rewards very committed gameplay.
[2023-01-11 07:55:03] <%Honako> @Shadow04 Normal axes sadly suck balls in Elden Ring :/
[2023-01-11 07:55:04] <%the_musko> LFG
[2023-01-11 07:55:21] <%Honako> I love axes but they need help.
[2023-01-11 07:55:22] <Tetsaiga> Has more strength been suggested? basthe4Jam
[2023-01-11 07:55:23] <%Zatharax__> I saw they buffed axes so I tried powerstance axes and it was so sad
[2023-01-11 07:55:24] <soulname13> @nazarbaayev i feel like the debate is more about the view of between , half full water cup or a half empty water cup titavHmm
[2023-01-11 07:55:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Panic buttons are punsihed with severity.
[2023-01-11 07:55:29] <%filthycasual62> It’s only perfect if it passes the moonveil bank test
[2023-01-11 07:55:30] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer as does ds1 and demons souls, i would say more so
[2023-01-11 07:55:30] <%Zatharax__> Oh they changed that?
[2023-01-11 07:55:34] <%Zatharax__> I though 99 was the hard cap
[2023-01-11 07:55:41] <%filthycasual62> Moonveil gank*
[2023-01-11 07:55:41] <Raymond_McL> That's so silly and I love it
[2023-01-11 07:55:41] <nazarbaayev> @soulname13 yea basically
[2023-01-11 07:55:42] <Asher_Reaver> Are you serious??
[2023-01-11 07:55:46] <@%$Pallydan9K> it go up
[2023-01-11 07:55:49] <%Zatharax__> Ok that's based
[2023-01-11 07:55:53] <Nomad_Kane> Basically everything from 56 to 99 has the same scaling.
[2023-01-11 07:55:57] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Less so. Again, consecutive roll stamina cost is a big one, DS2 is the only game to have the mechanic.
[2023-01-11 07:55:59] <Shadow04> @Zatharax__ Yeah, the only way I've seen people make axes good is using rkr/cragblade
[2023-01-11 07:56:05] <Senyax> @Oroboro would ER be broken with BB dash instead of rolls ?
[2023-01-11 07:56:06] <Asher_Reaver> FUCK I've been at 54 this whole time!
[2023-01-11 07:56:14] <DeadshotTex> this feels like a troll
[2023-01-11 07:56:16] <%$Noob_Almost> @Pallydan9K str only go up NODDERS
[2023-01-11 07:56:25] <%Zatharax__> Axes either need more poise damage or they need to be SS speed
[2023-01-11 07:56:25] <%filthycasual62> Nothing can stop me, I’M ALL THE WAY UP!!!!
[2023-01-11 07:56:25] <%Honako> The axe move set is just bad atm.
[2023-01-11 07:56:26] <codysnuts_> Always max str it's the only way
[2023-01-11 07:56:30] VIEWERS: 847
[2023-01-11 07:56:33] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer not less IMO, one mechanic doesnt mean more methodical
[2023-01-11 07:56:38] <@%$Pallydan9K> we do have bloodhound step
[2023-01-11 07:56:40] <%Zatharax__> Nah BB dash looks cooler
[2023-01-11 07:56:42] <Senyax> fk light rolls
[2023-01-11 07:56:44] <%Honako> All my homies hate light roll
[2023-01-11 07:56:44] <nightwings28> even bhs is still anoying at times
[2023-01-11 07:56:50] <soulname13> @Senyax well you can already do so, isnt it called step thing weapon art ?
[2023-01-11 07:56:54] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev It also has, on average, much longer telegraphs and recoveries than the other games. Rapiers, for instance, are very much reactable on even their quickest attacks.
[2023-01-11 07:57:04] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Not one mechanic, several.
[2023-01-11 07:57:07] <Senyax> step is not a dash
[2023-01-11 07:57:08] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer yes its clunkier

[2023-01-11 08:01:01] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev I'll explain then. Various amounts of tech like attack cancels for increased stamina costs, backstep iframes to support more aggressive playstyles at the cost of safety.

[2023-01-11 08:02:37] <Rodgeriangames> I remember oro’s dks2 days lol
[2023-01-11 08:02:42] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Then you don't know much about good combat, I'm afraid.
[2023-01-11 08:02:45] <Ann_Sam> younger oro wouldve won that
[2023-01-11 08:02:48] <Rodgeriangames> Miss those days
[2023-01-11 08:02:49] <Shadow04> @ハクア Poison in this game is pretty good too
[2023-01-11 08:03:04] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer but that combat just isnt good
[2023-01-11 08:03:09] <!%Ebonslayer> @Shadow04 Now that's a lie.
[2023-01-11 08:03:09] <soulname13> @nazarbaayev at that point has all game are just line of data, we can say its just a illusion of our perception a that point
[2023-01-11 08:03:10] <ハクア (harqua)> @Shadow04 if you mean rot i guess yeah, but rot is more like toxic, isn't it
[2023-01-11 08:03:19] <+VanOnTheMoon> wait D: this isn't Hades!
[2023-01-11 08:03:22] <%Honako> lol
[2023-01-11 08:03:23] <%KungFuAndrew> What was he trying?
[2023-01-11 08:03:27] <@%$Pallydan9K> poison in elden ring is alright
[2023-01-11 08:03:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev You simply don't like it. Something I can accept. It's far from bad though.
[2023-01-11 08:03:29] <nazarbaayev> @soulname13 its subjective at the end of the day yea
[2023-01-11 08:03:32] <@%$Pallydan9K> it's not ds2 level
[2023-01-11 08:03:33] <Asher_Reaver> @Oroboro Have you used braggart's roar on the giant crusher yet? Buffed R2 combos into R1 and it'll just kill whoever it hits LuL
[2023-01-11 08:03:34] <PickledSosig> the no lockon thing only works on stupid people
[2023-01-11 08:03:34] <%$Noob_Almost> definitely peeve NODDERS
[2023-01-11 08:03:37] <@%$Pallydan9K> but it does stuff
[2023-01-11 08:03:38] <Rodgeriangames> Dark souls 1 poison lol
[2023-01-11 08:03:41] <%filthycasual62> But don’t he still have an aura? Why be invisible if I can still see them?
[2023-01-11 08:03:44] <$yaboi_clav> 🤔
[2023-01-11 08:03:57] <%Zatharax__> Counters the shit out of casters though
[2023-01-11 08:04:10] <Nomad_Kane> Unfortunately for him, that's really bad against colossal swords.
[2023-01-11 08:04:15] <@%$Pallydan9K> SCIENCE
[2023-01-11 08:04:15] <%the_musko> Isn't that what this is?
[2023-01-11 08:04:17] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer fair enough, but you DO like it, still doesnt make it good or deep tho
[2023-01-11 08:04:18] <Rodgeriangames> I duel wield the ruins great word, it just destroys
[2023-01-11 08:04:25] <!AuroraUnit486> i experiment you
[2023-01-11 08:04:27] <Shadow04> @Ebonslayer Trust me bro, my source is....experience

[2023-01-11 08:04:54] <%KungFuAndrew> That was good
[2023-01-11 08:04:59] <Shadow04> @ハクア If you mean like annoying to fight, yeah. Same with poison
[2023-01-11 08:05:01] <%Zatharax__> Even through the aim punch you got his ass
[2023-01-11 08:05:05] <Rodgeriangames> Hahaha poise king
[2023-01-11 08:05:08] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer tho i think ds2 is a decent game overall, just my least fav personally
[2023-01-11 08:05:11] <ClogNog_Pigeons> oro be bullying O.O
[2023-01-11 08:05:20] <%filthycasual62> I can’t even say vigor check, the sword hits so hard
[2023-01-11 08:05:20] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Again, some things can be objectively measured. In the other games what is the point of backstepping for instance? There's no tech and not punishment for spam rolling besides possible roll catches.
[2023-01-11 08:05:20] <%the_musko> hell yeah
[2023-01-11 08:05:23] <@%$Pallydan9K> I'll crack your head open and take a look
[2023-01-11 08:05:25] <soulname13> @nazarbaayev by then , the good combat is the one you win, so even at a gameplay stand point some are bound to prefere the one that avantage their way of play, that is the of exemple like bleed : either stamina drain like demon souls or ds2 or just 1/3 life loose like ds1/3/elden ring
[2023-01-11 08:05:29] <DankerousMan> lol
[2023-01-11 08:05:37] <Asher_Reaver> That's a good point
[2023-01-11 08:05:44] <@%$Pallydan9K> Do I get to fight you if it is?

[2023-01-11 08:05:51] <%Zatharax__> How are you getting these invasions so quickly
[2023-01-11 08:05:52] <!%$Mohl97> that's a dangerously peeve-y thing to say oro
[2023-01-11 08:05:53] <PickledSosig> whats the minimum level that can invade 200?
[2023-01-11 08:05:54] <%+Silthous> Of the invasions are of higher quality at 200 I see no reason to stay at 90 or below
[2023-01-11 08:05:57] <%Zatharax__> Is PC just dead or what
[2023-01-11 08:06:00] <Senyax> since when u cared what peeve says ?
[2023-01-11 08:06:04] <@%$Pallydan9K> PC is just dead yeah
[2023-01-11 08:06:04] <!AuroraUnit486> "peeve said it" invalid instantly
[2023-01-11 08:06:07] <moonbath> i guess you live long enough to become the over- eveled
[2023-01-11 08:06:10] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer yeah but what one prefers and considers good combat is subjective i would say
[2023-01-11 08:06:17] <LuminArcTech> @Zatharax__ you can blame seamless for that
[2023-01-11 08:06:22] <Rodgeriangames> That’s one thing that really grinds my gears
[2023-01-11 08:06:24] <DankerousMan> 200 rl meta. LETS GOOOOO
[2023-01-11 08:06:26] <PickledSosig> PC aint dead at 60
[2023-01-11 08:06:27] <%KungFuAndrew> @nazarbaayev The combat you win is the combat you are skilled/comfortable with. Good combat is going to be a matter of preference.
[2023-01-11 08:06:28] <nazarbaayev> @soulname13 true true
[2023-01-11 08:06:30] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev Preference is purely subjective. Measurement is not.
[2023-01-11 08:06:35] VIEWERS: 890
[2023-01-11 08:06:35] <%filthycasual62> I’d save one or two just in case
[2023-01-11 08:06:40] <%Honako> Picking what parts of balance are important is arbitrary. There's no way to rate how "balanced" Seed is, or soul memory etc etc
[2023-01-11 08:06:51] <soulname13> well the moment you give the player the chance to summon friend at level X00 when their level 1X , its bound to broke the pvp
[2023-01-11 08:06:54] <EVVYmusic> i can tell that dude slammed his controller
[2023-01-11 08:06:55] <nightwings28> @Pallydan9K I still get arena pops at 330+ on pc, haven't tried invasions in a hot minute though
[2023-01-11 08:06:55] <%Zatharax__> Nah you can't fully blame seamless
[2023-01-11 08:07:07] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer but the measurement doesnt matter if you dont like it :p
[2023-01-11 08:07:08] <%$Noob_Almost> @Honako giant seed just means im rackin up more kills NODDERS
[2023-01-11 08:07:11] <%Zatharax__> It's a mod that you have to install with a friend that filters out a lot of people
[2023-01-11 08:07:12] <Senyax> 200
[2023-01-11 08:07:16] <@%$Pallydan9K> @nightwings28 well over 300 has the largest level pool in the game
[2023-01-11 08:07:21] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev That doesn't mean the game is bad though. It just means you don't like it.
[2023-01-11 08:07:22] <%KungFuAndrew> As the game ages, do you think people will be staying at 200?
[2023-01-11 08:07:24] <Rodgeriangames> Everyone complains about the katana spam, but never really about the ruins greatsword R2
[2023-01-11 08:07:30] <Rodgeriangames> LUL LUL

[2023-01-11 08:07:45] <%Honako> Good/bad or like/dislike is subjective all the same lol
[2023-01-11 08:07:49] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer i know, i said the game was decent overall lol, just not my personal fav
[2023-01-11 08:07:59] <@%$Pallydan9K> I do love me some ancient death rancor
[2023-01-11 08:08:02] <nightwings28> cancer incarnate

[2023-01-11 08:08:07] <%$Noob_Almost> @Pallydan9K that makes sense since if you don't pay attention to the discourse for whatever reason, you're gonna level to the point where you just slightly always win
[2023-01-11 08:08:09] <%KungFuAndrew> Jesus christ
[2023-01-11 08:08:10] <@%$Pallydan9K> so we're gonna be here for like... 50 casts

[2023-01-11 08:08:26] <!%Ebonslayer> @nazarbaayev You were saying it's bad earlier. If we're in agreement now then we can finish.
[2023-01-11 08:08:30] <soulname13> @Pallydan9K i aint against arena , but isnt it already proven to kill wld invasion down the line ? wich the reason why one find hight end match in it ?

[2023-01-11 08:08:56] <nazarbaayev> @Ebonslayer i said some aspects were bad, but not the game overall. So yea we'll agree
[2023-01-11 08:09:05] <%filthycasual62> And rot breathe, hate these two
[2023-01-11 08:09:15] <nightwings28> where is the moomveil

[2023-01-11 08:09:20] <Asher_Reaver> RL 90 is still great though, and even I think 125 sucks but it's where all the duelists are... 200 feels like it should be the new 125 oddly enough
[2023-01-11 08:09:22] <%cuttyriver420> lol
[2023-01-11 08:09:23] <atomicjest> @Zatharax_ sounds like a necromancer
[2023-01-11 08:09:25] <%Zatharax__> Then I die because it only works on one player at a time
[2023-01-11 08:09:25] <@%$Pallydan9K> @soulname13 uh, yes arena existing inherently makes invasions less likely

[2023-01-11 08:10:09] <!AuroraUnit486> seems like 200 is the new normal

[2023-01-11 08:10:19] <Shadow04> Im planning on having something broken for 90
[2023-01-11 08:10:19] <%Honako> I can almost never even get games at 70-90 on PC
[2023-01-11 08:10:23] <soulname13> @Zatharax__ yea but the investement for the dmg even at low level is abysmal sadly Sadge but at least is fun to have spooky skeleton

[2023-01-11 08:10:29] <%filthycasual62> 200 seems like the way, but there’s gonna be more dragon breath attacks

[2023-01-11 08:11:18] <Nomad_Kane> @Pallydan9K I'd say it makes invaders less likely and also invading into ganks less likely, but it also reduces competition for invasion slots if you are invading.
[2023-01-11 08:11:28] <artistCyCu> wait was that the same caster.
[2023-01-11 08:11:30] <@%Peeve> Anyone who prefers 70 or 90, or even 120-150, ask yourselves: "Am I gonna go through the endgame DLC on this build, and do I expect to invade anyone at this range in post-game content? pvpThink "

[2023-01-11 08:12:56] <LuminArcTech> it has a nice range compared to 90
[2023-01-11 08:12:57] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve Especially considering I can invade up to 167.
[2023-01-11 08:13:00] <@%Peeve> @Ebonslayer right, a minority of meta-level players looking for duels or sweatlord ganks.
[2023-01-11 08:13:05] <%Zatharax__> You got aimpunched
[2023-01-11 08:13:07] <%lProd_> depends on the build tbh. i feel like i use stronger builds at 90 to account for overleveled phantoms
[2023-01-11 08:13:18] <%KungFuAndrew> That skeleton pegged him LUL
[2023-01-11 08:13:19] <@%$Pallydan9K> pvpBag
[2023-01-11 08:13:25] <%lProd_> but usually they are fun
[2023-01-11 08:13:29] <EVVYmusic> lmaooo
[2023-01-11 08:13:35] <$JacklynMayful> 190 builds are for funn memey builds
[2023-01-11 08:13:36] <@%Peeve> end-game for casual players is 150 minimum, closer to 200
[2023-01-11 08:13:37] <stits45> Nvm LUL
[2023-01-11 08:13:40] <%KungFuAndrew> Helpful!
[2023-01-11 08:13:40] <@%$Pallydan9K> well shoot
[2023-01-11 08:13:48] <atomicjest> hate this catacomb
[2023-01-11 08:13:49] <soulname13> @Zatharax__ ds2 or bloodborn dlc wize titavTrigger ? either 1 billion res/hp or too fast for the eyes
[2023-01-11 08:13:58] <Officer_Battletoad> could just use the funny phantom finger ;)
[2023-01-11 08:14:03] <%Zatharax__> I can't wait for whatever bullshit katana we're going to get in the DLC
[2023-01-11 08:14:16] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve 167 is a pretty good range, overall. A surprising amount of players also stay at 150 just because that's the meta, even if they don't realize what exactly it's for.
[2023-01-11 08:14:16] <%Zatharax__> We had bleed laser, we have magic laser, what's next a lightsaber?
[2023-01-11 08:14:18] <@%$Pallydan9K> I enjoy the build making process
[2023-01-11 08:14:22] <@%$Pallydan9K> improving them slowly

[2023-01-11 08:14:36] <$JacklynMayful> how good is Serpernt spear for pvp at lvl 90?
[2023-01-11 08:14:41] <@%Peeve> @Ebonslayer yeah i'm talking about the massive casual audience. They won't be staying at 150 in the DLC. They're probably already far past that.
[2023-01-11 08:14:48] <$JacklynMayful> i dont use buffs
[2023-01-11 08:14:50] <$JacklynMayful> Lol
[2023-01-11 08:14:56] <SuburbanSocrates> @Oroboro Did you remember to change this character's name? It was Crimson Dragoon originally.
[2023-01-11 08:15:00] <@%$Pallydan9K> serpent spear is very strong because it has pre-patch crouch poke
[2023-01-11 08:15:03] <ハクア (harqua)> after 150 it's not a build anymore lol you can do everything
[2023-01-11 08:15:08] [Usernotice] Monosodium_Glutamate is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Oroboro's community! They've gifted a total of 130 in the channel!

[2023-01-11 08:15:11] <%$JacklynMayful> the most i use as buff is like the flask
[2023-01-11 08:15:15] <@%Peeve> why does no one listen to me modCheck you guys are going into the DLC on RL 90s with +8/20 weapons?
[2023-01-11 08:15:16] <Nomad_Kane> The thing about 200 is the stuff that's OP kind of changes... all of a sudden weapons that scale well off multiple stats are nuts.
[2023-01-11 08:15:17] <plip_plop_plip_plop> I feel like arcane is stronger at 200 proportionally
[2023-01-11 08:15:18] <%$JacklynMayful> ayy yo thanks!
[2023-01-11 08:15:19] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve That also depends on where the DLC is located. You're expecting them to do it after they beat the game, but that won't always happen.
[2023-01-11 08:15:21] <soulname13> @Zatharax__ noooo.. laser dagger or scypth ! with deathblight upon it LUL

[2023-01-11 08:15:41] <%$JacklynMayful> physik is enough for buff imo
[2023-01-11 08:15:41] <%Zatharax__> I hate 90 PVP you barely have a build at that level
[2023-01-11 08:15:45] <@%Peeve> @Pallydan9K but you won't be invading anyone pvpWTF aside from other meta duelists
[2023-01-11 08:15:52] <@%$Pallydan9K> yes, but that's not what you're asking
[2023-01-11 08:15:54] <soulname13> @Peeve prequel dlc most likely , time travel or may replace the tutorial at worst LUL
[2023-01-11 08:15:56] <DeadshotTex> sounds like a skill issue
[2023-01-11 08:15:57] <nightwings28> @Peeve Cause most people just follow the meta thats why sadge
[2023-01-11 08:15:59] <@%$Pallydan9K> you're asking if we will be doing it
[2023-01-11 08:16:02] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve 90 is definitely too low.
[2023-01-11 08:16:21] <soulname13> @Peeve you cant hope for ppl to think for themself are you ?
[2023-01-11 08:16:23] <%$JacklynMayful> vigor?
[2023-01-11 08:16:26] <@%Peeve> @Ebonslayer most casual players have already beaten the game. Not likely we'll have DLC in a game this huge that doesn't continue where you left off.

[2023-01-11 08:16:52] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve People will come into the game though. The initial wave will certainly be higher level, but that will pass.
[2023-01-11 08:16:53] <%filthycasual62> @peeve stop talking about me
[2023-01-11 08:17:00] <%$Noob_Almost> did a secret recently get found there or anything?
[2023-01-11 08:17:01] <%Zatharax__> From would be insane to not make DLC, and Bandai would hold a gun to their head regardless
[2023-01-11 08:17:06] <zeksafenstein> show build, please?
[2023-01-11 08:17:12] <%Zatharax__> This game WAAAAY surpassed expectations for sales
[2023-01-11 08:17:18] <soulname13> @Peeve would have been great to have a dlc , that force you to begin at low level again Sadge power creep is da way
[2023-01-11 08:17:33] <SuburbanSocrates> @Zatharax__ They're skipping DLC and going straight to Elden Ring 2.
[2023-01-11 08:17:43] <%KungFuAndrew> Whoever animated the trees LUL
[2023-01-11 08:17:45] <FeijoaSmoothie> For most of the casual playerbase I can confirm most people usually only have one character
[2023-01-11 08:17:46] <%Zatharax__> Elden Ring two
[2023-01-11 08:17:48] <@%$Pallydan9K> oh no, loretta's war sickle
[2023-01-11 08:17:55] <@%$Pallydan9K> oh no, they didn't even get to play
[2023-01-11 08:18:00] <%Zatharax__> It's just Elden Ring except there are 2 Tree Sentinels at the start and bleed explodes your bones IRL
[2023-01-11 08:18:03] <soulname13> @SuburbanSocrates nha they go back to mech game has gundam is official faith in japan Kappa
[2023-01-11 08:18:04] <carrmig> 2 Elden 2 Ring
[2023-01-11 08:18:23] <@%$Pallydan9K> it looks great, it is completely outclassed by the guardian swordspear in every way
[2023-01-11 08:18:27] <%Zatharax__> Charged Heavy on base Scythe true comboes into Loretta Slash
[2023-01-11 08:18:28] <FeijoaSmoothie> Guardian's swordspear has the same moveset and you can chasnge the ash of war
[2023-01-11 08:18:30] <%filthycasual62> @peeve to be fair, most people probably have a character that hasn’t gone to ng+ yet. I only got one that has moved on, 9 that aint
[2023-01-11 08:18:30] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve Think of AoA. That's unlocked pretty early game, and around the level you can invade Cathedral you can actually get some semi-consistent invasions in the earlier parts of that DLC.
[2023-01-11 08:18:35] <HoytyToyty_> id like to see you make a build on lorettas
[2023-01-11 08:18:36] VIEWERS: 1 176
[2023-01-11 08:18:36] <Nomad_Kane> It would be nice if it actually did damage... unlike the other weapon that shares that moveset.

[2023-01-11 08:18:54] <@%Peeve> @filthycasual62 most players that have beat the game are RL 200 already
[2023-01-11 08:18:56] <@%$Pallydan9K> I think you should just bump up to 200 every now and then
[2023-01-11 08:18:59] <EVVYmusic> do you have any goal outside of roasting people with your big sword
[2023-01-11 08:19:01] <soulname13> bibye titavBobble
[2023-01-11 08:19:06] <DankerousMan> why not just do half?
[2023-01-11 08:19:12] <Shadow04> I'd say have a character for every range, 90 and 200, and even 125 if you're daring
[2023-01-11 08:19:19] <Shadow04> and see what you like
[2023-01-11 08:19:30] <DeadshotTex> pick your poison low level = ash spam high level = spell/incant spam
[2023-01-11 08:19:31] <threothree> Make an offline backup of your PS5? If it doesn’t work out you could restore it
[2023-01-11 08:19:32] <%KungFuAndrew> Middleground? Not in Elden Ring, they made it just as severe as Demon's Souls
[2023-01-11 08:19:32] <Dauracul> I'd say back up your save and take everyone to RL 200 for a bit
[2023-01-11 08:19:32] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve Do you actually have numbers data for that claim?

[2023-01-11 08:19:46] <%filthycasual62> @peeve if all 10 of their possible characters are 200 and up, I would be shocked
[2023-01-11 08:19:49] <mightyburrito420> people who summon all collectively share on braincell tbh
[2023-01-11 08:19:58] <Nomad_Kane> Surely these people at lvl 200 have leveled vigor...
[2023-01-11 08:19:59] <@%Peeve> if you think the massive casual audience are beating the game at less than 150-200 you're delusional LUL
[2023-01-11 08:20:01] <Nomad_Kane> Surely...
[2023-01-11 08:20:02] <@%$Pallydan9K> Actually most people come in asking what the meta level is
[2023-01-11 08:20:10] <@%$Pallydan9K> and they're usually around 150
[2023-01-11 08:20:10] <%Zatharax__> I've killed people with 700 health at 200
[2023-01-11 08:20:10] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve Common sense is surprisingly uncommon in people.
[2023-01-11 08:20:25] <Shadow04> I've personally had a decent time at every range, I like having to change my invasion experience on the fly
[2023-01-11 08:20:33] <FeijoaSmoothie> RL 200 is fun tho, lots of fun broken spells to abuse
[2023-01-11 08:20:34] <Goffer54> I beat the game twice and I still had to grind out 20 levels to hit 200
[2023-01-11 08:20:35] <soulname13> @mightyburrito420 that called the pack mind set, if one jump off , they all follow Kappa

[2023-01-11 08:20:48] <%Hood13Joker> 125 is nice
[2023-01-11 08:20:49] <fush06> I think most people would end up after 125 but definitely under 200 without farming

[2023-01-11 08:20:56] <cwk1> most people have never watched an elden ring stream LUL or gone on elden ring reddit
[2023-01-11 08:20:56] <%filthycasual62> @peeve I’m as casual as it gets, and I beat it around 130
[2023-01-11 08:21:02] <%Honako> 150 sucks, but you have to fight them all the time on a 125
[2023-01-11 08:21:11] <Nomad_Kane> Honestly who cares if the hosts are sweatier if you're fighting the same phantoms.
[2023-01-11 08:21:17] <%KungFuAndrew> My first time beating this game I was at RL98
[2023-01-11 08:21:19] <ハクア (harqua)> 125 being matched with 150 in arena just made it worse too
[2023-01-11 08:21:19] <TheRealWholehorse> 125 matchmakes with 150 in arena, so go ahead and play at a level disadvantage LUL
[2023-01-11 08:21:25] <@%$Pallydan9K> I'm fine with just invading everyone

[2023-01-11 08:21:35] <@%$Pallydan9K> nobody else, just me
[2023-01-11 08:21:39] <Asher_Reaver> @Peeve I locked myself to 125 on my first playthrough, and I easily could have levelled past 200
[2023-01-11 08:21:44] <Awwbriebrie> I am p unaware of elden ring meta
[2023-01-11 08:21:44] <%Honako> Lot of people go 133 or so to be in the middle
[2023-01-11 08:21:48] <TheRealWholehorse> 150 is what it always was and arena solidified it

[2023-01-11 08:21:52] <%filthycasual62> @peeve I see what you’re saying, but the people who beat it the main game at a high level will gladly play the dlc at a high level for an easier time
[2023-01-11 08:22:01] <@%Peeve> @filthycasual62 did you rush the game? on my first playthrough i had to lose out on runes because i wanted to stay at 120, could've easily have reached 150, and i didn't even get to the Snowfield/Haligtree
[2023-01-11 08:22:03] <ハクア (harqua)> 137 so you can invade both 125 and 150 was the invader meta for a while
[2023-01-11 08:22:04] <fush06> what's up with sunbros trying to flank the invader as if it ever works?

[2023-01-11 08:23:40] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve They'd have to level another 32 times in the DLC to get out of range then.

[2023-01-11 08:24:23] <%Zatharax__> Is it going to be like Ariendel where you can enter it mid-game?

[2023-01-11 08:24:26] <Asher_Reaver> Yeah
[2023-01-11 08:24:28] <%Zatharax__> Or is it going to be endgame only?
[2023-01-11 08:24:34] <fush06> 138 can too, not sure about 139
[2023-01-11 08:24:36] <harley2123> I stopped at 135 on my PvP character, felt like a good medium for high level PvP.

[2023-01-11 08:25:57] <Spacedragie> seems like a 125; a 150 ; 137; and a 200 seems to cover everything.
[2023-01-11 08:26:01] <soulname13> @Zatharax__ yea , i hope we can close the veteran helmet
[2023-01-11 08:26:15] <Nomad_Kane> Unfortunately 125 doesn't really connect down to anything.

[2023-01-11 08:26:37] <harley2123> Personally, I prefer 150 BUT i stay at 125 to be safe, unless the meta changes a lot I don't see a reason to go past 125 for just a PvP character.
[2023-01-11 08:26:38] <Mr_WindUpBird> from what I gather here, people at those lower levels seem to enjoy invading experienced players as opposed to hunting "casuals" for youtube clicks LUL

[2023-01-11 08:27:13] <TheRealWholehorse> People don't purposefully stop levelling below 125. When you're 125 you typically only matchmake UP.

[2023-01-11 08:28:51] <%KungFuAndrew> @plip_plop_plip_plop Main reason is because at 125, you still have to make decisions to balance your character. At 150 you can essentially just have whatever you like.
[2023-01-11 08:28:54] <FeijoaSmoothie> It is nice to have 50 mind at RL 200
[2023-01-11 08:28:55] <ハクア (harqua)> @plip_plop_plip_plop you can already fit most builds on a 125, 25 more points break it

[2023-01-11 08:29:41] <%Zatharax__> Actually you know what I REALLY want from the dlc? A whetblade that gives you faith/int scaling and lightning scaling with faith

[2023-01-11 08:30:00] <%Zatharax__> maybe an int scaling for pure physical damage, call it gravity
[2023-01-11 08:30:00] <%KungFuAndrew> @plip_plop_plip_plop It means your decisions matter, instead of making a build mindlessly.

[2023-01-11 08:31:41] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop At 125 if you want something beyond the general basics to make the build viable you need to sacrifice for it. That's a good thing.

[2023-01-11 08:32:08] <%$dangitJM> Builds are still builds above 125. It's just that "pure" builds become hybrids and hybrids are able to match the other "meta" builds. The biggest issue with going above 125 has to deal with passive poise. That's the thing.

[2023-01-11 08:37:02] <%KungFuAndrew> @plip_plop_plip_plop I mean you asked why 125 instead of 150. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying why people like 125.

[2023-01-11 08:39:12] <%KungFuAndrew> @TheRealWholehorse I guess for me, knowing that I'm sacrificing something to gain something else makes the game feel more meaningiful.
[2023-01-11 08:39:18] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop Essentially, the higher your level the more points you can spend on Endurance without losing health or damage. People will naturally abuse this by wearing better armor.
[2023-01-11 08:39:22] <Nomad_Kane> @Zatharax__ At 200 that's probably not going to work too well.

[2023-01-11 08:41:34] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop Min-max at 125 is what prevents that from happening.

[2023-01-11 08:42:33] <%$dangitJM> but if players are only putting on the heaviest things... why aren't they wearing bull-goats?
[2023-01-11 08:42:37] <TheRealWholehorse> Bullgoat isn't even what it used to be. The only meaningful breakpoint past 101 is 125 for 1h halberd, which you can just 2h when you see bullgoat.
[2023-01-11 08:42:39] <%KungFuAndrew> @plip_plop_plip_plop This reminds me of when people would complain about only getting 60 cards in a Magic deck for MTG. Balancing a 60 card deck was way more fun than a 200 card deck where you could just have everything

[2023-01-11 08:43:19] <TheFedsAreAfterMe> @plip_plop_plip_plop 60 cards is a more consistent gameplan for most formats
[2023-01-11 08:43:21] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop Very similar, yeah.
[2023-01-11 08:43:49] <Spacedragie> 138 or 137?
[2023-01-11 08:43:57] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop You can tell the players who actually care about the game from those who don't with both arguments.
[2023-01-11 08:44:07] <stealing_waifus> we still chillin on 200?
[2023-01-11 08:44:19] <@%$Pallydan9K> uh yugioh normally does 40 cards

[2023-01-11 08:44:31] <@%$Pallydan9K> I did the math Oro, it's 138

[2023-01-11 08:45:38] <ZeracheilGames> did great swords and ultras get love enough to be good in pve at all since around launch or still a bit sub par?

[2023-01-11 08:45:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop Again, it's to maintain balance. Better than everyone at super high levels with full bullgoats 1 shotting each other.
[2023-01-11 08:45:54] <@%$Pallydan9K> all weapons are good in pve
[2023-01-11 08:46:01] <ZeracheilGames> sure but you know what I mean
[2023-01-11 08:46:04] <%filthycasual62> @zeracheilgames they were always good in pve

[2023-01-11 08:46:10] <%KungFuAndrew> @ZeracheilGames Greatswords and Ultras were never sub par in PvE, it's stunlock city for those builds
[2023-01-11 08:46:12] <%Honako> 👀
[2023-01-11 08:46:14] <Nomad_Kane> @TheRealWholehorse Sorry, meant to reply that there are several minor 2xR1 breakpoints and other things that it hits that people don't consider but end up mattering a lot when not using hyper armor weapons.
[2023-01-11 08:46:17] <mightyburrito420> which souls game has the best pvp in your opinion
[2023-01-11 08:46:19] <ysoqo> Aw shi
[2023-01-11 08:46:21] <%Zatharax__> Anybody else think Swift Shard does waaaaaaaaaaay too much damage for how fast it is?
[2023-01-11 08:46:27] <ZeracheilGames> I don't know how to build them then because I tried ultras and they felt awful
[2023-01-11 08:46:29] <plip_plop_plip_plop> I see your point but try hards in bullgoat will always be wack

[2023-01-11 08:46:41] <ZeracheilGames> poise felt like it never worked and enemies were too fast
[2023-01-11 08:46:46] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop But minimal at 125 because of the restrictions.

[2023-01-11 08:47:31] <%filthycasual62> @zeracheilgames ultras always staggered for me and greatswords were speedy from most of the unga bunga weapons I used.
[2023-01-11 08:47:33] <RighteousBuddy> my morning shift has started, am working from home today and we have Oroboro live PogU. I hope you stream for the next couple of hours <3
[2023-01-11 08:47:52] <Unded_Streams> @HoopleBogart I've been hearing more and more that ds2 had the best pvp, its the one I've played the least so I have no judgement but I wish I was there for ds1/ds2 golden age
[2023-01-11 08:47:52] <FeijoaSmoothie> @Zatharax__ but yeah I had 80 int with lusats
[2023-01-11 08:47:58] <ZeracheilGames> @KungFuAndrew I always played ultras in Souls but I couldn't make it feel good in Elden Ring
[2023-01-11 08:48:04] <psycotiktak> Why not parry like a god?
[2023-01-11 08:48:15] <plip_plop_plip_plop> I still haven’t played a lot of PvP above 175 so I guess I gotta see if the min max fuckery gets worse but so far I see more vets messing around in higher lvls which I like
[2023-01-11 08:48:31] <ZeracheilGames> @filthycasual62 is this at high rune level or something?  I couldn't get staggers on bosses and what not, and most of the time I'd get tapped out of attack
[2023-01-11 08:48:39] <%$Noob_Almost> "same build with less stats" oro downscaling himself so when he uses the fingy he'll be back to full stats

[2023-01-11 08:48:46] <%KungFuAndrew> @ZeracheilGames That's fair. Their jump attacks leave you pretty open, but they did improve the running R1s and regular R1 chains. They also made them deal more poise damage so bosses get broken very frequently
[2023-01-11 08:48:59] VIEWERS: 1 143
[2023-01-11 08:49:03] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop After a point it's not min-maxing, which is an issue. You just randomly throw around points and you get what you need, but that's a fair bit past 200.
[2023-01-11 08:49:16] <ZeracheilGames> Okay so I'm talking about ultras while refusing to just spam jump attack.  I know that was their only good move
[2023-01-11 08:49:28] <%filthycasual62> @zeracheilgames if you just R1 only, you won’t. But with jump attacks and R2s I usually get them to stagger in 3-5 hits
[2023-01-11 08:49:39] <ZeracheilGames> jump attack spam tho Bedge
[2023-01-11 08:49:45] <%KungFuAndrew> @ZeracheilGames Charged R2s are your friend in this game. But they are good enough to just R1, now.
[2023-01-11 08:50:02] <plip_plop_plip_plop> Exactly not that low. 300 would be wack but 200 is fine in that regard, just more weapons and builds become viable. Also more armor which sucks but it’s worth it lmo
[2023-01-11 08:50:19] <%$Noob_Almost> what if we was more stronk tho? POGGERS
[2023-01-11 08:50:25] <%$dangitJM> @plip_plop_plip_plop we can see clear examples of players throwing around stats randomly at 200 and they get vigor checked all the same
[2023-01-11 08:50:26] <%filthycasual62> @zeracheilgames I prefer the charged R2, hits like a mother
[2023-01-11 08:50:34] <@%Peeve> this sounds very exciting i'm excited for all the exciting build variety we're about to see
[2023-01-11 08:50:38] <!%Ebonslayer> @plip_plop_plip_plop If your build isn't viable at 125 there's an issue with it.

[2023-01-11 08:52:13] <%KungFuAndrew> @ZeracheilGames I happen to be a Zwei fanboy LUL But try adding Cragblade, hold in two hands, mash R1 at bosses. 3-4 hits breaks most of them. Hell, the Halberd stunlocks many bosses while two handing, it's pretty damn great

[2023-01-11 08:52:33] <%filthycasual62> @zeracheilgames best one early game is the Greatsword. The one in the Caelid Wagon. Other two are the Watchdogs Greatsword and the Ruins greatsword. Ruins is mid game and Watchdogs is only late game

Claims about build variety are very misinformed. At least on PC, where I assume people are just more savvy because searching for these things are an alt tab away

[2023-01-11 09:04:13] <rat_tongue> A journey peepoRun
[2023-01-11 09:04:16] <%$actual_zombie> wait, why can't you use the finger?
[2023-01-11 09:04:16] <%Zatharax__> Yeah I think it has to be EAC or something
[2023-01-11 09:04:16] <@%Wraff> Well tbh last I checked the mod had like 40k downloads about 2 weeks post release
[2023-01-11 09:04:22] <%Zatharax__> Either that or more people play console
[2023-01-11 09:04:24] <!%Ebonslayer> @ハクア Somewhat. Max damage doesn't increase, but you can have more versatility while retaining that damage output and without sacrificing other stats.
[2023-01-11 09:04:28] <%Zatharax__> Which is odd cause steam concurrent is still huge
[2023-01-11 09:04:30] <@%Wraff> And I haven't checked lately. We don't know they're all using it, but it likely adds another dent to the population
[2023-01-11 09:04:39] <ハクア (harqua)> @Wraff 590k unique downloads now
[2023-01-11 09:04:44] <kainnova> U got this @oroboro kill them good
[2023-01-11 09:04:49] <@%Wraff> @ハクア Yeah that'll put a dent in it
[2023-01-11 09:04:52] <+aimop95> How is it affecting the playerbase?
[2023-01-11 09:04:52] <Nomad_Kane> A lot of people download seamless directly for github as well.
[2023-01-11 09:04:56] <%$dangitJM> ER just had a huge influx this past holiday. PC is popping now. Get it while it lasts
[2023-01-11 09:05:04] <%filthycasual62> Place your bets, will they run into the boss room if they start losing?!

[2023-01-11 09:05:13] <ハクア (harqua)> seamless is actually recommended by most people on every social media as the way to play the game with friends
[2023-01-11 09:05:18] <PickledSosig> I dont think your average PvEer is smart enough to install mods
[2023-01-11 09:05:19] <%Zatharax__> Wait actually no it is just 200 because 50 I get instant invasions every time
[2023-01-11 09:05:23] <kazadog> barrier of gold is such a nice spell
[2023-01-11 09:05:24] <Pegolini> @dangitjm it had like 80k concurrent on Steam I think, pretty good tbh
[2023-01-11 09:05:34] <%Zatharax__> +9 50 at least

[2023-01-11 09:06:54] <just1frame> that was beautiful
[2023-01-11 09:06:56] <Nomad_Kane> The secret with the slow tracking spells is they have a limited turn radius, so if you run straight through them they'll track into the ground and fizzle.

[2023-01-11 09:30:07] <%KungFuAndrew> @chicasloco11433 Yeah, durability is very harsh in DS2. Use the Bracing Knuckle Ring to compensate, or just carry repair powder
[2023-01-11 09:30:11] <%$dangitJM> @ハクア Those sacrifices make sense for an enclosed environment like duels. Going 200 for invasions tho? A place where there are no inherent rules? Not so.

[2023-01-11 09:32:25] <tvpwnzu> Just don’t KEKW
[2023-01-11 09:32:25] <soggy_toze> @vexil420 don’t, turn back before it’s too late :P
[2023-01-11 09:32:25] <Ann_Sam> @vexil420 through the butt
[2023-01-11 09:32:27] <%anom96> what level has the least amount of sweats?
[2023-01-11 09:32:30] <+vexil420> 166?
[2023-01-11 09:32:35] <%+hagly> Honestly I don't know if people should duel or invade first. Both have their turn offs.
[2023-01-11 09:32:39] <RighteousBuddy> @Oroboro I don't see you doing alot of weapon swaps? Not part of your playstyle or something else behind it?
[2023-01-11 09:32:41] <+vexil420> sweet
[2023-01-11 09:32:48] <the_RAINMANN> level 300??
[2023-01-11 09:32:52] <RighteousBuddy> on this build I mean***
[2023-01-11 09:32:55] <MegaRhettButler> @vexil420 I found starting in low level ranges helped me. I started 32 +5 then went to 60 + 12. I'm about to move up to 138. Working on my build.
[2023-01-11 09:32:56] <ハクア (harqua)> @dangitJM that freedom is the problem. I can be too overpowered and that's just not my game
[2023-01-11 09:32:56] <%Honako> At 166 I'd suggest just going to 200.
[2023-01-11 09:33:06] <RighteousBuddy> LUL oke thanks Oro <3
[2023-01-11 09:33:10] <%anom96> I hate fighting meta guys
[2023-01-11 09:33:13] <Azra3l_TV> I'm invading at 200 atm
[2023-01-11 09:33:20] <TheRealWholehorse> 713 should be the meta level. It's the only level where all players are on equal ground.

[2023-01-11 09:33:34] <%Zatharax__> Phantom range hits me from 5 post codes away
[2023-01-11 09:33:34] <the_RAINMANN> @TheRealWholehorse is that all stats at 99?
[2023-01-11 09:33:41] <chicasloco11433> @KungFuAndrew I will! I was using lightning claymore since the durability on defender was horrible. That will fix it now. Thanks man!
[2023-01-11 09:33:42] <%anom96> meta level, meta build, haven't meta girl yet
[2023-01-11 09:33:44] <TheRealWholehorse> @the_RAINMANN yes
[2023-01-11 09:33:48] <%$dangitJM> @ハクア And that's fair. And yet, for invasion activity, invaders might not have much of a choice when comparing low levels, to dueling meta level, to above 150 activity.
[2023-01-11 09:33:59] <!%Ebonslayer> @TheRealWholehorse Fashion would basically die though.
[2023-01-11 09:34:00] <Shadow04> They're under
[2023-01-11 09:34:02] <6Bear6Knight6> Down?
[2023-01-11 09:34:04] <%PonyMontana> all the way down
[2023-01-11 09:34:04] <mambamantv> they are all the way down
[2023-01-11 09:34:07] <+vexil420> @Honako For sure
[2023-01-11 09:34:10] <%KungFuAndrew> @chicasloco11433 You're welcome :) claymore is fun too, but Defender GS damage is silly at high strength
[2023-01-11 09:34:12] <kush_cough710> @anom96 LUL LUL
[2023-01-11 09:34:12] <Shadow04> I hear the revenant
[2023-01-11 09:34:13] <mambamantv> where the revenants are
[2023-01-11 09:34:14] <+Mahoood> Nobody you invaded so far had meta vigor
[2023-01-11 09:34:17] <suspiciouslymissingsock> They are below you silly goose
[2023-01-11 09:34:24] <the_RAINMANN> suicide

[2023-01-11 09:34:30] <@%$Pallydan9K> I saw light
[2023-01-11 09:34:45] <the_RAINMANN> revenant messing them up
[2023-01-11 09:34:46] <!%Ebonslayer> @Pallydan9K Don't walk into it.

[2023-01-11 09:35:00] <ImperialDuck_> revenants ARE spooky
[2023-01-11 09:35:00] <@%$Pallydan9K> But I have business with god @Ebonslayer
[2023-01-11 09:35:02] <ハクア (harqua)> @dangitJM invasion activity is a completely different topic. I'm on PC so i've struggled with it for the longest time with EAC, and seamless. for the most part, the majority of players seemed to be on the 125~150 range
[2023-01-11 09:35:04] <zxthed> ofc they get slaughtered by revenants lol
[2023-01-11 09:35:21] <!%Ebonslayer> @Pallydan9K *GoW music starts playing*

[2023-01-11 09:35:38] <chicasloco11433> @KungFuAndrew Good thing I'm doing a str/faith build then. I keep that in mind :)
[2023-01-11 09:35:40] <@%$Pallydan9K> ZEUS oroMad
[2023-01-11 09:35:41] <RighteousBuddy> I haven't played ER in months and have picked it up recently. Have tried 90, 125, 12
[2023-01-11 09:35:48] <RighteousBuddy> 150, 200 and stil llike 200 the most
[2023-01-11 09:35:50] <%+hagly> The worst invasion spot is sub 30. It's terrible for both invader and invadee.
[2023-01-11 09:36:02] <beepleks> soul memory WutFace
[2023-01-11 09:36:09] <+joxom> soul memory NotLikeThis
[2023-01-11 09:36:16] <RighteousBuddy> How's invading at 60 guys?
[2023-01-11 09:36:17] <@%$Pallydan9K> huh my lv20 has a lot of fun turning people into food for the scarlet flower
[2023-01-11 09:36:32] <ImperialDuck_> soul memory is very unfortunate
[2023-01-11 09:36:34] <Ann_Sam> just wear the soul memory ring
[2023-01-11 09:36:42] <ein_resu> If you hit the max soul memory why dont you level any more? You dont right? you stay on 200
[2023-01-11 09:36:45] <+joxom> my SL1 character had like 5m soul memory, not a fair fight in sight OMEGALUL
[2023-01-11 09:36:46] <ZealouSol> @RighteousBuddy Felt good on xbox
[2023-01-11 09:36:47] <+darkwraith27> dark souls 2 has great pvp but the worst pvp matchamking cause of soul memory FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-11 09:36:50] <Limesnlem0ns> it didnt even fix the problem it was meant to solve
[2023-01-11 09:36:50] <+Astral_Blades> I think it's funny if too many people go to level 200 all the gankers are just gonna go to 200
[2023-01-11 09:36:57] <ZealouSol> 90 has been hella bad
[2023-01-11 09:37:01] <!%Ebonslayer> The fact that SM is DS2's worst problem goes to show how good the game is compared to the others, since in said others their biggest issues are mechanical.
[2023-01-11 09:37:16] <ImperialDuck_> fog!

[2023-01-11 09:37:33] <chicasloco11433> Of all souls games, ds2 deserves a remake if they ever do one imo. So underrated.
[2023-01-11 09:37:33] <%anom96> hot take. elden ring went too far with buffing
[2023-01-11 09:37:48] <@%$Pallydan9K> oh elden ring went too far with everything
[2023-01-11 09:37:51] <@%$Pallydan9K> probably on purpose
[2023-01-11 09:37:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @chicasloco11433 Its receiving the fanbase it deserves in recent years.
[2023-01-11 09:38:03] <ItsMaken> I invade at lvl 1, I mostly get new players in limgrave caves & stormveil
[2023-01-11 09:38:06] <%cuttyriver420> lol
[2023-01-11 09:38:08] <%$dangitJM> @Ebonslayer Let's not revise history by saying that DS2 doesn't have its share of "mechanical" problems. But that's a topic for another time.
[2023-01-11 09:38:08] <+darkwraith27> LOL
[2023-01-11 09:38:10] <%KungFuAndrew> LOL
[2023-01-11 09:38:13] <ImperialDuck_> lmaooo
[2023-01-11 09:38:15] <ハクア (harqua)> @dangitJM idk. most people are in arena, and 200 invasions are still the same 800 hp mages and moonveil poise monsters that somehow still die in one jump trade. ironically enough, invading at 70 and 90 felt better for me because the overleveled phantoms were hard to kill some times
