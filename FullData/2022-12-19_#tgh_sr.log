[2022-12-19 09:42:28] <%BridgetEndeavor> I'm enjoying cohost a lot but I hope they eventually implement something to cut down on seeing repeat posts. As it stands sometimes I'll see the same post five times in a row from people sharing it
[2022-12-19 09:42:36] <%BridgetEndeavor> Especially when they're long posts
[2022-12-19 09:42:36] <%+Izandai> After the discussion about Lickitongue using Fly, now I imagine that it uses its tongue for all its HMs. It shoves rocks with its tongue, it cuts trees with the sharp edge on its tongue, and it Surfs by sticking its tongue into the water and using it like a hydrofoil.
[2022-12-19 09:42:51] <@%AmberCyprian> there's a script for tampermonkey that removes the repeat posts

[2022-12-19 09:51:36] <%Worldwide_Wimpy> is POKEMON a popular franchise??? couldnt tell LUL
[2022-12-19 09:51:38] <TalenLee> I love how pokemon wound up being the source of lies and nonsense of a generation the way that 'the movies' were urban myths a generation earlier
[2022-12-19 09:51:41] <Ionic_Iris> I spent so long unlocking the Orange Islands
[2022-12-19 09:51:47] <%$Procyonyx> pressing a repeatedly after throwing a ball makes it more likely to catch the mon and no one can tell me otherwise
[2022-12-19 09:51:48] <%sadib100> you have to press a+b+start+select
[2022-12-19 09:51:50] <%compiling> Hold B for a better catch rate
[2022-12-19 09:51:57] <Idixal> the mew myths were unending
[2022-12-19 09:52:01] <%+EwolaKoala> yeah Jimmy everyone already knows that, gosh
[2022-12-19 09:52:01] <%$llamaking__> Mew under the truck is the best video game myth ever, and mashing A during the ball catching animation totally helps catch the mon I swear

[2022-12-19 09:52:25] <%+Izandai> The best part of all the gen 1 Mew rumors is that the actual really-works Mew Glitch is just as absurd as‚Äìyeah, exactly. PrideLaugh

[2022-12-19 09:53:25] <TalenLee> I'm trying to remember if it's a book or a article, but the 'My uncle who works at nintendo' is a literal wing of ethnographic study, of the principles of how we make up sotries to share
[2022-12-19 09:53:26] <%+Izandai> Fight this specific trainer, then teleport at the same as you step in front of a trainer's line of sight, then return to the route and you find a Mew. Arguably even more implausible than using strength on the truck 100 times, BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS. PrideLaugh
[2022-12-19 09:53:26] <%Zemtor> This run brought to you in part by Shed Skin TM

[2022-12-19 09:53:42] <CynthiaKnight> Get a pokemon with a specific special stat and walk onto a specific tile and teleport before the trainer can approach you. It's so much more insane than the actual myths.
[2022-12-19 09:53:59] <%endrift> I REMEMBER when the Mew Glitch was found
[2022-12-19 09:54:15] <%endrift> I dug out my copy of Yellow to try it out because I hadn't fought all of the trainers yet
[2022-12-19 09:54:22] <Ionic_Iris> It's too bad the Magic Muffler isn't legal in Kaizo
[2022-12-19 09:54:28] <%Quostin> Did it even work in Yellow?
[2022-12-19 09:54:28] <Arquill> Use strength on the truck!
[2022-12-19 09:54:31] <%+Fio_Hart> My friend got a Mew from Nintendo and changed the story of how he got it every time someone asked him.
[2022-12-19 09:54:31] <%endrift> They give you a lava cookie for that in FRLG
[2022-12-19 09:54:35] <%berniebeatsboxes> You know what else was easily believable? Nugget "Bridge"
[2022-12-19 09:54:36] <Idixal> How was that one so widespread?
[2022-12-19 09:54:41] <%endrift> "Congrats, you get a cookie"
[2022-12-19 09:54:50] <%TheArtGremblin> @Quostin It sure did. Talen and I did it.
[2022-12-19 09:54:56] <basshole96> in crystal clear mew is ACTUALLY under the truck
[2022-12-19 09:54:57] <TalenLee> the mew under the truck thing was a great example of something that was kid-challenging to replicate and adult-simple
[2022-12-19 09:54:58] <%endrift> (That's true btw, though it's just "interact with", not "use strength on")
[2022-12-19 09:54:59] <%$llamaking__> Its funny how they later added super rare stuff that sounds like a myth, like the level 50 magikarp in HG/SS in one specific tile
[2022-12-19 09:55:03] <%$Procyonyx> we're older now, which means we know that those things exist in our hearts
[2022-12-19 09:55:03] <%+Izandai> And then RSE had Mirage Island, which doesn't get you a Mew but is just as ridiculous as any Mew rumor. Talk to this one random NPC every day and eventually he'll tell you he sees an island and then you can go there and find some rare pok√©mon (I forget what's actually there).

[2022-12-19 09:55:55] <TalenLee> and a large portion of these rely on institutional forgetfulness; the assumption that after recess, everyone kinda-forgets what was actually said, so if it doesn't work, 'you musta remembered it wrong'
[2022-12-19 09:55:58] <Idixal> @izandai I think it was a specific type of berry and wynauts

[2022-12-19 10:06:20] <%+Izandai> And yeah, the reason the Cinnibar Island Glitch works in Red and Blue but not Red and Green is... Okay, so in gen 1 ground tiles are divided into quarters, and the game looks at one specific quarter of the tile to determine what encounters should be possible on that tile. But between R/G and R/B they changed which corner of the tile the game looks at, and I don't quite know the technical details but that's what causes Cinnibar Island's east coast to have encounter table fuckery.
[2022-12-19 10:07:01] <+WingedRegent> @Izandai So it was an adjustment on the tile behavior between the original games and the ENG releases of R/B that caused *all* of that?
[2022-12-19 10:07:15] VIEWERS: 419
[2022-12-19 10:07:41] <+Rootballa> @Izandai easiest way to describe it is that in yellow, the water tiles are part of the nearest encounterable zone, but in R/B, they're the "east" half of a set of town tiles. and cinnabar wasn't given natural surf encounters because the water near it is.. well, another route

[2022-12-19 10:07:51] <Wiencong> repelling perish song
[2022-12-19 10:07:54] <%+Izandai> It also has an effect in Viridian Forest, because there's a bunch of grass tiles that have flowers in a corner, and in R/B a bunch of those tiles have flowers in the corners that the game looks at to determine encounters, but there's no encounters for a "flower tile", so there's a bunch of tiles in Viridian Forest in those games where you just can't get encounters, which makes it way easier to walk through without getting encounters, even without repels.

[2022-12-19 10:10:00] <%+Izandai> @CynthiaKnight Yup, and that's how you can use the Old Man Glitch to get whatever encounters you want, depending on what you set your name as.
[2022-12-19 10:10:08] <+WingedRegent> @Kappatechy This is due to the game storing your name in the cache where the encounters would go, yeah, which is why the letters determine the Levels and actual Pokemon you encounter.
[2022-12-19 10:10:09] <CynthiaKnight> then if you get an encounter in a location that shouldnt have encounters, like cinnibar island, that data is loaded

[2022-12-19 10:11:42] <%+Izandai> @Kappatechy It can also be used to get regular encounters of Safari Zone pok√©mon, since you can Fly directly from Fuchsia to Cinnabar, and neither zone updates the encounter table, so when you surf on Cinnabar's east coast you still get Safari Zone encounters.

[2022-12-19 10:13:52] <+WingedRegent> @CynthiaKnight I feel that applies to Gen 1 and *especially* Gen 2 as well, yeah. There's so much in those games.
[2022-12-19 10:13:54] <CynthiaKnight> I once heard that the reason the game glitches out so hard instead of just crashing is that crash behaviour would've been a waste of space
[2022-12-19 10:13:56] <thebluecolor> it's crazy to me how many optimizations they went through to get every little thing in there, but they still have all the data for Mew, which they never intended to be encounterable

[2022-12-19 10:15:56] <%+Izandai> Here's a wild story about gen 2 coding: The programmers were having trouble making the whole game fit on the cartridge, so they turned to Satoru Iwata for help. He optimized the storage so efficiently that there was enough leftover room to fit in a scaled-down version of Kanto in there as well, and that's how the gen 2 postgame happened.

[2022-12-19 10:18:25] <%+Izandai> @thebluecolor In fact, Mew was only put into gen 1 because there was just a little bit of leftover storage space after the games were done. Shigeki Morimoto added it in basically in secret literally two weeks before development wrapped, and the limited space available is why its design is so much simpler than Mewtwo's.

[2022-12-19 10:20:09] <%+Izandai> @CynthiaKnight Basically, yeah. Games don't usually crash directly because of things glitching out, they crash because those glitches trigger sanity checks, which is basically the program looking at itself and determining if what's happening is normal behavior, and if not, it just shuts everything down to prevent damage. But early pok√©mon didn't have room for any of that,  which is why you can overwrite so much of the game's data and it'll just keep trucking along as best it can.

[2022-12-19 12:51:34] <jegfaaraldri> with smart AI I think it's like 10% to use explosion from full, and then the chance increase a lot as it loses health
[2022-12-19 12:51:39] <SonGokuecas95> why didn't smart ai use perish?

[2022-12-19 12:51:54] <S17Master> @SonGokuecas95 Because Role Play is also a Status move, so they have equal priority

[2022-12-19 12:52:04] <%+Hawkfeather__> It doesn‚Äôt realize that perish song just wins
[2022-12-19 12:52:08] <%+arom21032> There wasn‚Äôt an asterisk next to perish song in the tracker, but there was next to explosion

[2022-12-19 12:56:56] <%$Kailaria> TTar is quad weak now, and can be prioritied
[2022-12-19 12:56:57] <$prof_lesmis> or not xD
[2022-12-19 12:56:58] <%+Hawkfeather__> @walba1396 you can try to win with struggle
[2022-12-19 12:56:58] <%uneseulenuit> mach punch is still super effective on cacturne
[2022-12-19 12:56:58] <Walba1396> fair
[2022-12-19 12:57:02] <%Cerpin_> o7 twineedle, did some good work

[2022-12-19 12:57:03] <%compiling> 30 PP.  Very nice
[2022-12-19 12:57:04] <%$llamaking__> Imagine if the ball handler saves the run with Mach Punch
[2022-12-19 12:57:07] <%$Styrmerino> actually good fr
[2022-12-19 12:57:07] <KenOutOfTen> This Porygon got hands

[2022-12-19 12:57:20] <+F_e_d_e_r_i_c_o> yeah much better, with the bug move you have 11 0.5 effective mons , with mach punch you have 0
[2022-12-19 12:57:24] <nightbringer57> This duck sure knows how to punch tho
[2022-12-19 12:57:35] <n_g_da> it covers Aggron and does neutral dmg to Skarmory. That's a win in my book
[2022-12-19 12:57:35] <%+Izandai> We are so much less scared of T-Tar and steel types now. That was actually great.
[2022-12-19 12:57:37] <%$Kailaria> rival time

[2022-12-19 13:08:57] <AmoebaUK> At 90 you don't really gain a lot from one level up, though if you could potentially get to 92 you get the damage increase. Seems like a lot of risk tho so most runners tend not to grind for any levels in VR.

[2022-12-19 13:44:21] <%Mirby_Studios> it won't heal if it gets into range before it attacks
[2022-12-19 13:44:22] <%+Izandai> They only use one heal on each mon, except for the ace.

[2022-12-19 14:27:05] <TalenLee> speedruns and kaizo runs are all tests of the same general parameter of skills. Kaizo, this kaizo in particular, is a work of *endurance* and *persistence*. you could have given up at 1k and nobody would say that was a weak effort.
[2022-12-19 14:27:06] <%arne501> change PB

[2022-12-19 14:45:13] <%Izandai> And its special attack was crap, so its one damaging move, Bullet Seed, did nothing.

[2022-12-19 14:46:34] <%Izandai> Yeah so that was fine.

[2022-12-19 14:52:52] <%+Draggo__x3> !bullshi
[2022-12-19 14:52:52] <%firin_bot> Or just the blissey run tbh LUL LUL Sorry if taco you want more attack?? Like their gyms left.

[2022-12-19 14:53:37] <%S17Master> When Wailord lived with 1 HP, I legit could only read its move as "Counter"
[2022-12-19 14:53:43] <%Izandai> Also, the trainer class for Champion was This. The final boss was This Shitter.
[2022-12-19 14:53:54] <WolfgangSandwich> It protected your last Dizzy Punch LUL
[2022-12-19 14:53:56] <ThatisChloe16> @S17Master that would be a tragedy

[2022-12-19 14:54:24] <%Cerpin_> the PP held out till the very end
[2022-12-19 14:54:32] <%Izandai> God, we ended that with full HP and two full restores in the bag.

[2022-12-19 14:54:55] <%Izandai> The double Protect was something else. PrideLaugh

[2022-12-19 14:55:23] <%+Draggo__x3> Emerald Kaizo sounds fun
[2022-12-19 14:55:27] <stalkor> kaizo emerald?
[2022-12-19 14:55:46] <%Izandai> Note: Kaizo Ironmon Emerald. Because apparently Emerald Kaizo is something else.
[2022-12-19 14:55:51] <Gunderrode> heart gold ironmon is so fun... pity it's so bad on the items
[2022-12-19 14:56:10] <%+Draggo__x3> The only problem with Emerald is after Winona there's a massive trainer grind
[2022-12-19 14:56:21] <%+Draggo__x3> MASSIVE trainer grind it's worse than after Pokemon Twoer
[2022-12-19 14:56:24] <%Izandai> Worse than the Kanto Tour?

[2022-12-19 14:57:06] <%Izandai> Oh, actually, there's a thought. Youtube has a max upload length of 12 hours right? Might have to split the run into two videos.

[2022-12-19 15:00:59] <victaghost> armaldo existed to cause mald
[2022-12-19 15:01:03] <%Izandai> The funny thing is, if Shitter lead off with Armaldo, it probably would've been fine, right? Because its moves didn't do anything, and you had three full restores to heal off the sandstorm damage.
[2022-12-19 15:01:03] <rapratama> what u are trying to do ?
[2022-12-19 15:01:13] <%drakeirving> I was saying before last rival that if you happened to lose from not enough heals, the run really lost to armaldo

[2022-12-19 15:02:52] <%S17Master> Worst case scenario, we can level up the mons we caught. Breaks the rules some, but we are already technically breaking the rules by catching this many mons per area
[2022-12-19 15:03:00] <slamdunkgator91> now for round 2 do you still have to use the items that you have got during the initial run?
[2022-12-19 15:03:04] <%0ldmanbiff> the crobat had all the PP, but this run had the heals
