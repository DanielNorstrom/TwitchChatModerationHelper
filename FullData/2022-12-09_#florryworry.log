[2022-12-09 12:20:17] <pancynik> @Florryworry  Lambs are born without fully developed intestines. And they rely on their mother’s milk for nourishment. After a few weeks, they begin to develop their digestive system and can start to eat solid food. At the same time, their coat starts to change from a soft, downy fuzz to more adult-like wool.   Lambs grow steadily during their first year, gaining weight and getting taller. By adulthood, lambs will have a set of adult teeth and can mate. Every lamb matures at its own pace. Howe

[2022-12-09 13:34:43] <BramBam16> @Florryworry I thought the +1 fire for horses as Siam was broken tho? Or is that purely because they probably already have insane horsies?
[2022-12-09 13:34:53] <tolstoyyyy> @Florryworry so is it OK for me to have lvl3 infantry at tech 29?
[2022-12-09 13:34:55] <kyle606> worrying about unit pips is like rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic

[2022-12-09 13:35:08] <%Tayip999> the siam +1 fire isn't for pips...

[2022-12-09 13:35:13] <Psyman2> Unit pips matter on cannons because they transfer half their pips rounded down to the frontline.

[2022-12-09 13:36:38] <%Tayip999> +1 fire is different to pips...

[2022-12-09 13:45:28] <priest_lul> Cog and barque torture (CBT) is a naval activity involving transportation of troops or landing to the enemy country. This may involve directly painful activities, such as building galleys, fighting the English navy, taking naval or maritime ideas, protecting trade with light ships or even attempting to understand naval combat.
