[2022-12-15 20:43:59] <mcbuffmcbufferedition> Older English makes far more sense (1400-1800) than modern. It’s very similar to German.
[2022-12-15 20:44:12] <druzo5> English is complicated but it’s the most efficient language

[2022-12-15 20:47:20] <bluehairash> Yes I’ve seen
[2022-12-15 20:47:27] <+Silentg93> I've never seen anything dwarf fortress but I love rimworld so I figured I'd check it out!
[2022-12-15 20:47:40] <+slymarb0o> is there a single character mode in this version of the game? or only fortress mode? @ambiguousamphibian
[2022-12-15 20:47:54] [Notification] FilthySerf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! [Those are some nice Dwarves there, itd be a shame if you had a necromancer appear]
[2022-12-15 20:48:00] <wired2sleep> is it similar to cdda
[2022-12-15 20:48:04] <+evilsupernin> I'd say you should mention it's OLDER than RimWorld
[2022-12-15 20:48:05] <hooodle> @slymarb0o not yet, it will be out soon. It's in the classic though!
[2022-12-15 20:48:11] <+Silentg93> thanks for the tl;dr :)
[2022-12-15 20:48:31] <HBGHoney> Its a 2005 project i believe

[2022-12-15 20:48:33] <emp_john_romero> legacy free forever
[2022-12-15 20:48:35] <%+Harqinz> Legacy is still free as far as I know
[2022-12-15 20:48:35] <RiftShep> Dwarf Fortress is a game in which a giant werewolf made of pus can murder all your dwarves
[2022-12-15 20:48:35] <Tumuel> more like if the sims had a crazy uncle
[2022-12-15 20:48:36] <+thirstypiano18> Can’t wait for adventure mode.. and once they add magic will be my all time favorites
[2022-12-15 20:48:53] <DonColadangelo> what will adventure mode have?
[2022-12-15 20:48:54] <+slymarb0o> @hooodle i never played the classic, so graphics and ui might be an issue, i will wait for it to come out on steam
[2022-12-15 20:48:55] <hooodle> Legacy will always be free, they were very explicit about that
[2022-12-15 20:49:00] <bluehairash> Legacy will never fall
[2022-12-15 20:49:01] <%+genosse_kamerad> The only game you can play in an office and say its a spreadsheet legacy dwarf fortress
[2022-12-15 20:49:01] <Sweaper1993> They will still be working on the legacy
[2022-12-15 20:49:09] <+evilsupernin> legacy will also get some UI updates for free from the steam version
[2022-12-15 20:49:10] <hooodle> @slymarb0o I'd recommend playing fortress mode in the meantime! It's pretty incredible.

[2022-12-15 21:07:52] <huskarlmarx> @ambiguousamphibian If not changed since the previous version, melee attacks with crossbows were governed by the hammerdwarf skill, so heavy crossbows and cross-training with hammers is a good insurance policy

[2022-12-15 21:26:02] <senpai_slime> weapon and armor racks don't work properly, you need a stockpile in their barracks instead iirc
[2022-12-15 21:26:06] <%+Harqinz> @SamuraiBebop07 you assign them per season. As long as it's the appropriate season and you have seeds they'll do it
[2022-12-15 21:26:10] <TsunamiAromatic> @SamuraiBebop07 It already is, it just changes for each season what they can plant

[2022-12-15 21:46:11] <+President_Bulldog> the only sword you can make of rock is obsidian
[2022-12-15 21:46:17] <phosphor_66> You can also make a training area outside at your entrance. That way the training dwarves notice and fight invaders and it helps prevent cave adaptation.
[2022-12-15 21:46:19] <Delacue> Rock short need obsidian which can get fairly sharp

[2022-12-15 21:47:15] <OneTrueCube> @President_Bulldog they don't have the same material properties as steel though so they will be way less effective on armored foes

[2022-12-15 21:48:08] <phosphor_66> once you have a hospital and all
[2022-12-15 21:48:09] <+Syluxrox> only VERY small, higher chance of actually hurting yourself permanently
[2022-12-15 21:48:23] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian Old danger rooms would speed train dwarves by hitting them with automatic spear traps...full of... training spears
[2022-12-15 21:48:23] <Delacue> There's always a risk of nerve damage which can never heal

[2022-12-15 21:49:03] <phosphor_66> You used to be able to make a danger room with spear traps where they train, but now that is much more dangerous and likely to kill dwarves. That would help train armor and dodging and such though

[2022-12-15 21:53:03] <phosphor_66> If you click Details, you can edit one of their uniforms then save it with a name. Then you can assign that new uniform to the whole squad.
[2022-12-15 21:53:09] <+President_Bulldog> ^
[2022-12-15 21:53:10] <Sweaper1993> Are silver hammers still the go to blunt weapons?
[2022-12-15 21:53:13] <OneTrueCube> @Harqinz the trick is to get a necromancer as your leader :3
[2022-12-15 21:53:16] <%+toofatcrew> how's it going everyone?
[2022-12-15 21:53:18] <phosphor_66> It's not super intuitive, but makes sense once you do it a few times.
[2022-12-15 21:53:42] <Zhinj> Once you tell them to update equipment they try to go get whatever they need
[2022-12-15 21:53:43] <%groundkontrol> this is the mssive headache I am muddling through myself
[2022-12-15 21:53:49] <TsunamiAromatic> It's uh....
[2022-12-15 21:53:57] <CptAustus> update equipment gives an order for the dwarves to recheck their gear
[2022-12-15 21:53:58] <TsunamiAromatic> not the best UI
[2022-12-15 21:54:03] <+NicaaOp> Add a new uniform
[2022-12-15 21:54:03] <%+Harqinz> @OneTrueCube Yeah I did that once. There was an incident. In front of the central stairwell and grand hall. Pop went from 316 to 14 in about 10 minutes
[2022-12-15 21:54:16] <zephyrwave> For weapons they'll equip what they like as long as individual choice is selected
[2022-12-15 21:54:17] <phosphor_66> I love you too :)
[2022-12-15 21:54:18] <Sky______King> :)
[2022-12-15 21:54:19] <Aranak> WARNING! Mining, woodcutting, and hunting have a "civilian uniform" that conflicts with all military equipment. Assigning any dwarf with the mining, woodcutting, or hunting labors enabled to the military is strongly discouraged
[2022-12-15 21:54:20] <phosphor_66> lol
[2022-12-15 21:54:26] <OneTrueCube> I just love the wacky shit you can do with this game
[2022-12-15 21:54:30] <TsunamiAromatic> You can also just set the material to wood
[2022-12-15 21:54:44] <+President_Bulldog> Listen to what aranak said, @ambiguousamphibian

[2022-12-15 21:55:02] <phosphor_66> You hit confirm instead of confirm and save, so it only made it for the one guy
[2022-12-15 21:55:04] <phosphor_66> I think
[2022-12-15 21:55:11] <hooodle> @ambiguousamphibian millitary screen is the worst so far, Toady said its not done and is getting a rework
[2022-12-15 21:55:15] <+moldy_fuzz> yeah it's not ideal
[2022-12-15 21:55:19] <TsunamiAromatic> UI still needs work yeah
[2022-12-15 21:55:25] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian See @phosphor_66 hes right
[2022-12-15 21:55:31] <+President_Bulldog> i cannot wait for adventure mode, thats my bread and butter
[2022-12-15 21:55:32] <OneTrueCube> With how granular the Military UI can be, this was always gonna be the biggest challenge of the game
[2022-12-15 21:55:40] <%groundkontrol> build a uniform on a dorf, then save it as a type
[2022-12-15 21:55:42] <Inworth> This military menu is effective new and doesn't work like the one game's one
[2022-12-15 21:55:51] <Inworth> old game's*
[2022-12-15 21:56:00] <+moldy_fuzz> go to the one you edited and do confirm and save
[2022-12-15 21:56:06] <OneTrueCube> Yeah tbh there
[2022-12-15 21:56:07] <Aranak> even old player dident know about it i found the info today
[2022-12-15 21:56:13] <TsunamiAromatic> @Inworth I finally got good at that UI and they just yank it away from me LUL
[2022-12-15 21:56:17] <%+Harqinz> I honestly like the new military menu. It has all the same functions and behaviors but EVERY button has been changed it's amazing lmao
[2022-12-15 21:56:22] <OneTrueCube> There are few things missing in the new UI that were possible in old UI
[2022-12-15 21:56:36] <+President_Bulldog> @Aranak one caveat to that is a squad set to equip picks who are all master miners
[2022-12-15 21:56:45] <gibeg> Yeah It took a minute to get used to but I like this menu as well
[2022-12-15 21:56:48] VIEWERS: 1 394
[2022-12-15 21:56:50] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian They will take off their armor when not on duty, that 'uniform over clothes' thing matters. If you wanna get really granular you can tell them what to wear down to specific socks
[2022-12-15 21:56:52] <phosphor_66> Yeah, it's weird getting used to the UI after playing the old way for like 15 years lol
[2022-12-15 21:56:53] <OneTrueCube> Now they don't have armor assigned
[2022-12-15 21:56:58] <phosphor_66> I like the way they are going though
[2022-12-15 21:57:04] <TsunamiAromatic> @Harqinz I think some functionality should be exposed to a top level or something. Uniforms aren't unique to squads
[2022-12-15 21:57:25] <gibeg> theres even more options in the schedule editing
[2022-12-15 21:57:26] <+President_Bulldog> also they can wear alot more shit than you think, you can put multiples of items in uniforms
[2022-12-15 21:57:34] <+Bucklax31> Just tuned in, is this sped up, why is their movement so weird
[2022-12-15 21:57:39] <%+Harqinz> oh yeah UI definitely needs work, but us vets have 10 years of experiecne with the old menu lmao
[2022-12-15 21:57:45] <TsunamiAromatic> true
[2022-12-15 21:57:47] <+moldy_fuzz> the old military UI sucked too, to be fair
[2022-12-15 21:57:48] <%groundkontrol> your hallways are very narrow. dwarves passing over each other fele overcrowded.
[2022-12-15 21:57:49] <Aranak> @President_Bulldog ok its need to be master to use the pick by default as a weapon
[2022-12-15 21:57:50] <burgndy> the only 24 drinks making me nervous
[2022-12-15 21:57:52] <FlyguyJP> Dwarf Fortress shows how far Rimworld has come in terms of being user friendly. DF is a beautiful nightmare
[2022-12-15 21:57:55] <%groundkontrol> feel*
[2022-12-15 21:58:00] <OneTrueCube> @President_Bulldog Is shirt - chainmail - breastplate - cloak still possible
[2022-12-15 21:58:06] <phosphor_66> I still kinda miss dwarf therapist. Trying to figure out skills of all the dwarves is annoying with the UI, hopefully they work on that
[2022-12-15 21:58:15] <+Syluxrox> SO HIIIIIGHHH
[2022-12-15 21:58:16] <+President_Bulldog> @OneTrueCube i assume so
[2022-12-15 21:58:21] <TsunamiAromatic> @FlyguyJP I'm not sure that rimworld would be as friendly if it had all the same features
[2022-12-15 21:58:22] <DJAceOfSpades> THE ONE DWARF IS REAAAAAAL
[2022-12-15 21:58:46] <+moldy_fuzz> @phosphor_66 yeah the default labor system drives me nuts

[2022-12-15 21:59:31] <Delacue> The work order screen needs tabs
[2022-12-15 21:59:32] <+President_Bulldog> the only thing rimworld needs imo is z-levels. even if only 3 (basement, surface, sky)

[2022-12-15 22:01:18] <phosphor_66> Manager will get to it eventually as long as they have an office. If they are set to do other labors though, it can take a while

[2022-12-15 22:09:23] <FlyguyJP> @gentlefood So does the magma melt the gears when the gate is open meaning the gate will never close again? Or does the heat eventually make the gear fail and the magma floods in unexpectedly?

[2022-12-15 22:35:38] <+LieutenantMilk> if you make more than 1 tile wide, the dorf will have time to run away
[2022-12-15 22:35:46] <+mechmatthy> howdy do
[2022-12-15 22:35:50] <+vejtables> yeah if you channel the last two tiles from above and it breaches the tube below
[2022-12-15 22:36:01] <+susanxboyle69> also the lavas hot
[2022-12-15 22:36:04] <bunnymud> carefullt
[2022-12-15 22:36:06] <+TheLordMelvin> Use a lava proof suit
[2022-12-15 22:36:07] <%+Harqinz> you dig out the ground next to the lava and let it flow in :)
[2022-12-15 22:36:08] <artemiish> one doesn't
[2022-12-15 22:36:17] <sothalothgothmoth> i just assumed that one dwarf is always doomed to death by it
[2022-12-15 22:36:22] <DJAceOfSpades> @ambiguousamphibian Did you know you can use magma to power forges?
[2022-12-15 22:36:24] <+zoolot> Losing is fun.
[2022-12-15 22:36:29] <phosphor_66> mining into lava builds character

[2022-12-15 22:36:39] <+oburge> Don’t think you want to dig directly above the lava channel
[2022-12-15 22:36:40] <%+Harqinz> Every fort is a throwaway fort ;)
[2022-12-15 22:36:40] <+LieutenantMilk> yeah just go through forts, and then you can reclaim them
[2022-12-15 22:36:42] <+susanxboyle69> is this the new minesweeper dlc
[2022-12-15 22:36:48] <+moldy_fuzz> all forts are throwaway :)

[2022-12-15 22:37:10] <+LieutenantMilk> as far i know its only furnaces
[2022-12-15 22:37:16] <Arcanilie> Magma is used as heat source in forges
[2022-12-15 22:37:21] <DJAceOfSpades> Sadly no, there are just magma powered furnaces
[2022-12-15 22:37:30] <+richarm88> did you see the great yt video some madlad built his entire fort in one of the underground caves with the sole purpose of encouraging monster fights
[2022-12-15 22:37:32] <%+Harqinz> dwarf blood will boil and burst when exposed to magma, but there's no issue with just... standing next to the hottest substance under the earth
[2022-12-15 22:37:33] <Atreidie> magma forges and magma smelters. Only things I know that power from magma
[2022-12-15 22:37:37] <artemiish> magma can only power the special magma furnaces
[2022-12-15 22:37:43] <+zoolot> Magma is also a good way to sacrifice pesky nobles. Guys, it's not only for forges.
[2022-12-15 22:38:06] <OneTrueCube> I once channeled out a whole room of magma under a nobleman's room so he had a heated floor
[2022-12-15 22:38:10] <Atreidie> Everyone forgets about the magma smelter :( poor fella
[2022-12-15 22:38:23] <phosphor_66> I had to build an automated magma cat murderer back in the day when there was that patch that made cat populations explode

[2022-12-15 22:42:20] <+GuinnessC_> @ambiguousamphibian I think if you need to release lava like that again you should channel out the tile from above to keep the dorf from self immolating
[2022-12-15 22:42:27] <%+Harqinz> It dopes move lsowly yes
[2022-12-15 22:42:32] <+LieutenantMilk> water flows quicker i think
[2022-12-15 22:42:42] <+GuinnessC_> oof
[2022-12-15 22:42:43] <emp_john_romero> its good to flood the cavern with lava
[2022-12-15 22:42:45] <+richarm88> it flowed faster at the start than water but slowed down. in water an orthoganal start you can get away from?

[2022-12-15 22:45:47] <phosphor_66> Tower cap is basically a mushroom that is an underground tree

[2022-12-15 22:45:58] <OneTrueCube> I do not think they are fireproof

[2022-12-15 22:46:03] <IpsosCustodes> others are not
[2022-12-15 22:46:06] <OneTrueCube> I think they may eventually light on fire
[2022-12-15 22:46:20] <phosphor_66> It might count as a structure when still growing like that and follow different fire rules, not sure
[2022-12-15 22:46:21] <TsunamiAromatic> I think natural "walls" are not currently flammable

[2022-12-15 22:46:28] <WillWKM> I think you can use them to make fireproof wooden structures if that's ever necessary
[2022-12-15 22:46:37] <%+Harqinz> It's burning a tree growing out of the water cool

[2022-12-15 23:05:28] <+Kharmander> how is the game?
[2022-12-15 23:05:29] <%+Harqinz> confirmed
[2022-12-15 23:05:30] <+richarm88> now you know the mechanics, i expect a youtube video in a haunted biome
[2022-12-15 23:05:30] <zynysterg> yea
[2022-12-15 23:05:33] <+p0mM3h> confirmed
[2022-12-15 23:05:33] <konggary> there's a game logic fps cap in game settings
[2022-12-15 23:05:35] <Tiresias999> yeah alt + f4 / f3 for speed
[2022-12-15 23:05:36] <+p0mM3h> time is ticks
[2022-12-15 23:05:36] <TsunamiAromatic> You can show FPS
[2022-12-15 23:05:40] <Atreidie> it does increase gamespeed
[2022-12-15 23:05:40] <Inworth> Turn on the fps visualizaer
[2022-12-15 23:05:40] <%+Harqinz> but FPS may be capped by your CPU
[2022-12-15 23:05:44] <+Leeeum> Can't believe I've managed to miss 2.5 hours of this!
[2022-12-15 23:05:46] <TheMightyBurrito> I can confirm that I do not know
[2022-12-15 23:05:49] <zynysterg> low fps will give you high latency and bad input lag
[2022-12-15 23:05:53] <ilikecaterpillar> Go under the game tab in the settings. you want the game-frame-per-seconds menu item.
[2022-12-15 23:05:54] <zynysterg> but its useful sometimes
[2022-12-15 23:05:56] <WishingOnAWendy> Are ya winnin son?
[2022-12-15 23:05:57] <%+Harqinz> You'd think so, but this is DF
[2022-12-15 23:06:01] <Atreidie> I run at 100 and it goes pretty well till hit around 140pop
[2022-12-15 23:06:01] <Inworth> Simulation speed and rendering speed are different
[2022-12-15 23:06:04] <+Leeeum> DF is single threaded
[2022-12-15 23:06:05] <%+Harqinz> only uses 2 cores
[2022-12-15 23:06:07] <FlyguyJP> Everyone is neglecting the obvious solution: unplug the computer to win game
[2022-12-15 23:06:07] <Aranak> i can confirmed that you can change the fps
[2022-12-15 23:06:10] <Aranak> just dont know how
[2022-12-15 23:06:14] <TsunamiAromatic> It goes up and down by 10 fps per press
[2022-12-15 23:06:14] <+richarm88> is the bad happening
[2022-12-15 23:06:19] <+Leeeum> And they currently have some GPU FPS issues which they are trying to fix
[2022-12-15 23:06:28] <bow257> its faster if you rub alcohol on the CPU dye
[2022-12-15 23:06:32] <TOPLEL__> dig just 1 tile?
[2022-12-15 23:06:33] <%+Harqinz> @Leeeum I saw today something about it using a second core for UI, and the other for simulation, have you heard similar?
[2022-12-15 23:06:38] <+LieutenantMilk> do you have fuel?
[2022-12-15 23:06:39] <bow257> makes the connections smoother
[2022-12-15 23:06:39] <746pos> You need charcoal to fuel the metalsmith
[2022-12-15 23:06:43] <moonbearbacon> didnt you make everyone a miner?
[2022-12-15 23:06:44] <phosphor_66> @ambiguousamphibian You need charcoal to have them forge stuff
[2022-12-15 23:06:48] <+Leeeum> @Harqinz Yeah that's true actually

[2022-12-15 23:07:37] <ilikecaterpillar> Graphics FPS, is the generic FPS. The Game Frames-per-second in the game section of the settings is the setting you want to speed it up.
[2022-12-15 23:07:39] <+isaacgh23> It's also a building material
[2022-12-15 23:07:42] <746pos> Looking at your notifications on the left makes me wonder what the notifications for emails on your phone show lol
[2022-12-15 23:07:42] <+Leeeum> Heard the same, they just need to try fix some of the GPU FPS issues which I reckon will happen after Christmas

[2022-12-15 23:08:25] <Atreidie> refined coal is also charcoal. I spent an hour on this last night lol
[2022-12-15 23:08:25] <tw1tch_tex> can also make coal at the smelter with the bituminous coal
[2022-12-15 23:08:25] <%+Harqinz> it is referred to as both coal AND charcoal in the game in some places

[2022-12-15 23:10:16] <fuzzzatron> You have SO many farms
[2022-12-15 23:10:28] <%+Harqinz> The farming labor IS assigned to 'everyone' by dewfault. you're not totally wrong
[2022-12-15 23:10:29] <TsunamiAromatic> Everyone farming causes a lot of time lost to walking
[2022-12-15 23:10:32] <+RemeoSpes> time to destroy some farms
[2022-12-15 23:10:43] <phosphor_66> That can happen, you can use the labor menu the help control that. Like setting your best cook/miner whatever do only that.
[2022-12-15 23:10:45] <%+Harqinz> It's a short job but it tends to happen all at once right after a harvest they all run up at the same time and plant the next wave

[2022-12-15 23:27:33] <%majikguy> @tribaja True, but he got the announcement when he channeled down into the magma. The magma filled in with obsidian when the water hit it and blocked vision to what he had revealed.

[2022-12-15 23:27:36] <Michael_on_Twitch> dig over than down on an upper level if you can find the adamantine on the walls

[2022-12-15 23:28:09] <tribaja> @majikguy Pretty sure it was just revealed when the magma sea was revealed because it's in the walls of the magma sea somewhere
[2022-12-15 23:28:12] <Mordarnis> can you pump all the lava out of the lake?

[2022-12-15 23:29:17] <TsunamiAromatic> There is one way down though

[2022-12-15 23:29:20] <Anvil4> @ambiguousamphibian your usual story telling ways with enchanting vocabulary always does wonders in your videos, don't overthink it you wonderful creature
[2022-12-15 23:29:20] <+Truzoeka> Wait can somebody please tell me if this is still the first fort? XD
[2022-12-15 23:29:22] <+TheXupinga> my cave is -129

[2022-12-15 23:29:28] <+pbevertv> You're gonna find the circus soon
[2022-12-15 23:29:30] <donbeaTees> only way to go deeper is through the candy... but you CAN go deepre
[2022-12-15 23:29:34] <CptAustus> to dig through the bedrock, youll have to mine through the adamantine
[2022-12-15 23:29:37] <IpsosCustodes> i think the bedrock is slade?
[2022-12-15 23:29:37] <Inworth> Adamantine goes through the bedrock
[2022-12-15 23:29:39] <ScrumpetSheep> throw a dwarf in it and see waht happens
[2022-12-15 23:29:41] <OneTrueCube> @ambiguousamphibian Gotta find the adamantine and dig down thru it
[2022-12-15 23:29:44] <+Gullah> the adamantite is significant because its the only way further once you hit the bottom, you gotta find where that announcement shows it
[2022-12-15 23:29:45] <%majikguy> Just start excavating
[2022-12-15 23:29:49] <Zathrasi> @ambiguousamphibian Historically the "bedrock" is called "semi-molten rock"
[2022-12-15 23:29:51] <+pbevertv> lots of fun stuff down there
[2022-12-15 23:29:54] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian check the adamantine notification. The adamantine will provide a channel down through the bedrock
[2022-12-15 23:30:04] <donbeaTees> Pickaxe notification, click the mysterious gem wall notification
[2022-12-15 23:30:06] <Aranak> ^^^^^^^
[2022-12-15 23:30:08] <tribaja> @ambiguousamphibian Look for the adamantine discovery announcement with all the other rock announcements, should be able to click there
[2022-12-15 23:30:18] <ScrumpetSheep> there is a pickaxe on your allert bar. if you click it you can see if you have struck adamantine yet
[2022-12-15 23:30:18] <%majikguy> You don't need to channel, just mine out a bunch of space on this level and see if you find anything
[2022-12-15 23:30:24] <Michael_on_Twitch> on left
[2022-12-15 23:30:24] <donbeaTees> pickaxe notification button
[2022-12-15 23:30:28] <TsunamiAromatic> It's still there
[2022-12-15 23:30:28] <Tiresias999> you can view it again in the alert
[2022-12-15 23:30:30] <+richarm88> can you make adamantine armor for your dwarf bros

[2022-12-15 23:31:29] <donbeaTees> @rubyflash15_heart  yes
[2022-12-15 23:31:31] <%+Harqinz> @notlocalhost they can see through the magma, it's giving off light, obviously.
[2022-12-15 23:31:31] <+Gullah> @rubyflash15_heart yes it turns the lava into obsidian stone
[2022-12-15 23:31:33] <rubyflash15_heart> oh, neat
[2022-12-15 23:31:34] <Tiresias999> water + lava = obsidian

[2022-12-15 23:31:52] <Little_Lambkin> @donbeaTees It feels like water + magma should make steam that fries everything...
[2022-12-15 23:31:52] <donbeaTees> @Gullah  so ANOTHER thing they ripped off of Minecraft Kappa
[2022-12-15 23:31:56] <phosphor_66> go up to a level above the magma and just run a single wide tunnel over there and stairs down
[2022-12-15 23:31:56] <djgtkgmv> love your streams for the vibes, perfect to leave on in the background or fall asleep to :)

[2022-12-15 23:32:55] <+krazy_kaiser> you should come down from a higher level right on top of it

[2022-12-15 23:35:46] <cystic_pizza> @foolishus All the graphics are ASCII and it's just hard to get into cause everything is a keyboard shortcut.
[2022-12-15 23:35:51] <cystic_pizza> It's fun tho
[2022-12-15 23:35:57] <Scarboski> RIP DWARFS

[2022-12-15 23:36:00] <ScrumpetSheep> @foolishus Its not. Its very similar but the graphics really help understanding whats going on, even as a veteran of the series. both are fun.
[2022-12-15 23:36:06] <+foolishus> @cystic_pizza thanks
[2022-12-15 23:36:10] <TWCroc> They're the same except free version interface is a mountain to climb
[2022-12-15 23:36:10] <Michael_on_Twitch> @foolishus are you good with keyboard only controls, ascii graphics, and additional programs to truly control your game?
[2022-12-15 23:36:14] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian They're all running up to the top floor to drink lol
[2022-12-15 23:36:18] <donbeaTees> The Classic update will have the mouse controls and new UI from my understanding, but will not have the graphics (and maybe not the music)
[2022-12-15 23:36:23] <xhanostm> Just send the military to anger it and lead it up to the fort
[2022-12-15 23:36:37] <+foolishus> thanks for the information guys i really do appreciate it

[2022-12-15 23:38:23] <Its_Tombstone_Tim> My old enemy.... STAIRS
[2022-12-15 23:38:24] <Gavitron> I never really got the point of worrying about spoilers in a game that basically requires a wiki to play
[2022-12-15 23:38:31] <TsunamiAromatic> WHAT?!
[2022-12-15 23:38:32] <+zoolot> Lol, it died
[2022-12-15 23:38:33] <+richarm88> rip

[2022-12-15 23:38:36] <ScrumpetSheep> It was just a leech
[2022-12-15 23:38:36] <OneTrueCube> WOW
[2022-12-15 23:38:38] <Its_Tombstone_Tim> You didn't find the circus
[2022-12-15 23:38:40] <Scarboski> back in the game CoolCat
[2022-12-15 23:38:40] <OneTrueCube> nbd
[2022-12-15 23:38:40] <Zathrasi> Yeah they're not that bad sometimes
[2022-12-15 23:38:40] <Gavitron> some forgotten beasts die easily
[2022-12-15 23:38:42] <+Gullah> your dorfs SMOKED IT
[2022-12-15 23:38:43] <Flecolan> check the combat log
[2022-12-15 23:38:43] <xhanostm> Welp that did not work LUL
[2022-12-15 23:38:44] <+Omnishots> w
[2022-12-15 23:38:44] <Its_Tombstone_Tim> You found a random wall leech
[2022-12-15 23:38:45] <CptAustus> time for more !FUN!
[2022-12-15 23:38:47] <cystic_pizza> @foolishus my main complaint with classic is that it just takes a long time to get anything done, especially like editing your dwarf's labors -- there are 3rd party utilities that help with that sort of stuff, but I hate the idea of using 3rd party shit, personally.
[2022-12-15 23:38:49] <Kugelschreib3r> taking a dip
[2022-12-15 23:38:49] <evilwalls> WELP
[2022-12-15 23:38:51] <bunnymud> Turbo doorfs on the attack
[2022-12-15 23:38:52] <Gavitron> sometimes they're made of steam and they die in one hit from a lute
[2022-12-15 23:38:57] <+illreviewanything> It's a leech, my guy.  Leech demon, yes.  But still a leech.
[2022-12-15 23:38:57] <ScrumpetSheep> LOOK AT COMBAT AND SEE WHO KILELD IT
[2022-12-15 23:39:01] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian I gotta be honest this is not how this interaction usually plays out
[2022-12-15 23:39:03] <TsunamiAromatic> toasted
[2022-12-15 23:39:10] <%$the_end_is_beer> check the combat log
[2022-12-15 23:39:12] <TsunamiAromatic> Go up and around
[2022-12-15 23:39:19] <+LieutenantMilk> i didnt know you can find a lone demon, without discovering the main deal itself
[2022-12-15 23:39:19] <%+Sir_Draconis> the leech demon SHALL NOT PASS!!!
[2022-12-15 23:39:19] <%+Harqinz> yeah check the combat log see how it died

[2022-12-15 23:39:34] <%+Harqinz> There's usually more than one. A lot more.
[2022-12-15 23:39:36] <+moldy_fuzz> might be easier to dig down from another direction
[2022-12-15 23:39:39] <Gavitron> the beasts are randomly generated so they're strength varies wildly
[2022-12-15 23:39:43] <%+Harqinz> A LOT More.
[2022-12-15 23:39:44] <gregorybrake777> it you

[2022-12-15 23:39:51] <ScrumpetSheep> That smoke is a burning dwarf i think leahst1HA leahst1HA
[2022-12-15 23:39:53] <Gavitron> some of them will kill ten dwarves in a second
[2022-12-15 23:39:56] <%+Harqinz> this was amazing
[2022-12-15 23:39:58] <+foolishus> @cystic_pizza icic i think i'm going to try the original for now and then see if I want to buy the steam one
[2022-12-15 23:39:59] <%majikguy> Demons and forgotten beasts both range from godlike to nearly harmless depending on what they are made out of. A demon made of ash falls apart when it's hit, for example.
[2022-12-15 23:39:59] <746pos> breach the magma sea for real fun
[2022-12-15 23:40:01] <+aviox193> check the combat log see how it died?

[2022-12-15 23:40:23] <cystic_pizza> @foolishus The steam one is worth it -- as a new player, you'll like the steam version much better and the devs absolutely deserve your money.
[2022-12-15 23:40:28] <%+lunacorvidae> Byeee
