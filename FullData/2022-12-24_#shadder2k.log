[2022-12-24 15:21:25] <Naradai> @Wasdniak It is something they are very good at. But I think a lot of people see their choices for what that are: greed. Thankfully we can always vote with our wallets
[2022-12-24 15:21:56] <blue_laguna> actually insane $20 for a fucking skin

[2022-12-24 15:22:52] <Naradai> @blue_laguna yeah, they're creating artificial scarcity and then making people pay through the nose for stuff we got for free in OW1.
[2022-12-24 15:22:59] <blue_laguna> rather just play a gacha game instead of having a goated zenyatta skin lmao

[2022-12-24 15:23:13] <%+Wasdniak> @Wasdniak I certainly do, trust me. But it really feels like most of these games/publishers are in "too big to fail" territory. You can preach bad business practices to people, but an overwhelming number of people still buy in regardless. The most you can do is just not engage with it yourself.
[2022-12-24 15:23:23] <+neurolion> the whole fucking team lmao

[2022-12-24 15:24:09] <%+Wasdniak> @blue_laguna Actually true. Ironic in a way.
[2022-12-24 15:24:24] <Naradai> @Wasdniak I agree with this. No one is untouchable, but for the lay person the best we can do is not buy into it

[2022-12-24 15:26:24] <Naradai> @Axonkid 'yet'... but I agree, I think that would be too far for a lot of people

[2022-12-24 15:29:17] <blue_laguna> @axonkid i mean it’s not even about that if the skins would be cheaper even more ppl would buy them including me
[2022-12-24 15:29:34] <Axonkid> But why put in effort when ppl will pay ridiculous amounts regardless
[2022-12-24 15:29:39] <blue_laguna> ik a lot of ppl who dont buy them but if they were $10 or $15 would splurge
[2022-12-24 15:29:43] <%+Wasdniak> @Axonkid that's why most money is spent on marketing and making the game pretty. Shiny shiny sells
[2022-12-24 15:29:43] <bobyclat> but it has no impact on the game
[2022-12-24 15:29:43] <%+damnchinese> i would buy skins if they wernt lazy and made genjis blade and shurikens blue HahaBall
[2022-12-24 15:29:53] <blue_laguna> paying 20 for a skin just feels wrong even if u have the dough
[2022-12-24 15:30:07] <bobyclat> yeah but no one is forcing you to, its just a cosmetic

[2022-12-24 15:32:03] <%+Wasdniak> The good thing about skins in CS is that you can resell, BUT they certainly played a part in popularizing the lootbox

[2022-12-24 15:32:42] <bobyclat> i think you have to be a specific type of person to open loads and loads of cases
[2022-12-24 15:32:51] <bobyclat> in reality you can just buy a skin and sell it on later

[2022-12-24 15:34:16] <bobyclat> but surely when you as the consumer buy a lootbox e.g cases in cs you know the risks no?
[2022-12-24 15:34:17] <blue_laguna> honestly the csgo market was fucked up but since it wasn’t ridiculously overpriced to buy the actual cases it was a fucking cash grab i bought a lot of those shits back in the day
