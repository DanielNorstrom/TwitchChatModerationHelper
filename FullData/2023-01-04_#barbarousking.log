[2023-01-04 03:12:50] <%corignis> The great thing is that different people enjoy different things, giving us a lot of different shit to enjoy

[2023-01-04 03:12:55] <Tenosis> Has Snake been keeping up with his QA work?

[2023-01-04 04:36:42] <%potapeno> VS literally spawned an army of clones
[2023-01-04 04:36:42] <teamLNCHBX> fun*
[2023-01-04 04:36:49] <%RubTheDucky> loop hero super innovative.  Played no game like it
[2023-01-04 04:36:51] VIEWERS: 3 428
[2023-01-04 04:36:53] <%+Sheenzie> This level is stressful to watch.
[2023-01-04 04:36:54] <%potapeno> new map, new characters, new weapons
[2023-01-04 04:36:54] <FlipSidesBack> Bro I have watched you make this level for years now
[2023-01-04 04:36:55] <%+jamescid> new characters and a giant map
[2023-01-04 04:36:55] <teamLNCHBX> more weapons/characters maps
[2023-01-04 04:36:56] <%steves_garage> gawd that stupid game....an obvious pander to cat lovers
[2023-01-04 04:37:01] <%bizangles> New levels/characters/weapons
[2023-01-04 04:37:02] <1l3_fin> The motion tracking they did for Stray is pretty cool but the game is boring af
[2023-01-04 04:37:03] <%+HeyItsGuf> Levels are more complex in the DLC
[2023-01-04 04:37:05] <%$yasarumit> Steam users select the nominees and then vote about Steam Awards so it's just a joke
[2023-01-04 04:37:06] <%$Mi4_Slayer> oh you remind me ! clips were down , I have to make one real quick KEKW
[2023-01-04 04:37:09] <%bizangles> It's pretty much more of the same
[2023-01-04 04:37:10] <teamLNCHBX> its 2$ i think
[2023-01-04 04:37:14] <%mort459> Stray is a video game for people who dont like video games
[2023-01-04 04:37:14] <%bizangles> But it's also like $2
[2023-01-04 04:37:16] <%NaanNegotiable> like a real map, with landmarks
[2023-01-04 04:37:18] <%+KoltonMcCombo> i thought this was Naruto ost for a second lol
[2023-01-04 04:37:18] <BahamutOdin> I’ve been having a blast with Loop hero. Thanks Barb!
[2023-01-04 04:37:19] <%+BarbViewer> Vampire survivors is on mobile as well
[2023-01-04 04:37:22] <%+SpecialK44> Potionomics is a pretty clever game I played this year
[2023-01-04 04:37:22] <%$trenchiest> Like 6 new character, with unique weapons each, and a big complex map
[2023-01-04 04:37:23] <teamLNCHBX> TUNIC WAS SO GOOD
[2023-01-04 04:37:26] <teamLNCHBX> i loved it
[2023-01-04 04:37:31] <%$CriticalBuzz> The Witness was innovative.
[2023-01-04 04:37:31] <%drgnrave> VS spawned a whole genre, and it's fun to see all the new games
[2023-01-04 04:37:32] <+CHOOCHOOCHEWY> risk of rain is god tier rouge-like
[2023-01-04 04:37:35] <teamLNCHBX> thats fair NODDERS
[2023-01-04 04:37:37] <%missilechion> haelThan
[2023-01-04 04:37:41] <%bizangles> I heard you can turn off the combat and make it just about the puzzle
[2023-01-04 04:37:42] <%$Fuzzwizzle> @FlipSidesBack That's the effort it takes to make it good
[2023-01-04 04:37:46] <%potapeno> RoR1 is prety meh, RoR2 is amazing thou
[2023-01-04 04:37:47] <teamLNCHBX> im a sucker for those kind of games
[2023-01-04 04:37:47] <%$shmoppy> cult of the lamb, still wish they would done more with it
[2023-01-04 04:37:48] <%Beeteebee> The combat wanted to be hard but had no finesse
[2023-01-04 04:37:49] <%moonlightsun21> the secrets in VS are pretty good but it is definitely a passive game
[2023-01-04 04:37:51] <%buttercupsupreme1> I really loved the manual portion and puzzles in tunic but the combat wasn't the best
[2023-01-04 04:37:55] <%+BarbViewer> Tunic looked like a game I’d enjoy. Still gotta try it.
[2023-01-04 04:37:57] <%+HeyItsGuf> I 100% Tunic... it was very meh
[2023-01-04 04:37:58] <teamLNCHBX> and i loved the convoluted puzzle stuff LULW
[2023-01-04 04:37:58] <%ImFatRollingIRL> i couldnt get into the combat either, think i gave up after the first boss
[2023-01-04 04:38:00] <%TitaniumTogekiss> pugPls pugPls pugPls pugPls pugPls
[2023-01-04 04:38:03] <%drgnrave> @potapeno Did you hear about the remake of RoR1?
[2023-01-04 04:38:10] <%+shartmcbritches> sup borb good evening
[2023-01-04 04:38:11] <%WrathOfBom> it's zag's boyfriend's theme...
[2023-01-04 04:38:14] <teamLNCHBX> Nerdge you just dont get stray, its a mastapiece
[2023-01-04 04:38:18] <%samuraichameleon> it seems even people who like stray are confused how the hell it won most innovative gameplay
[2023-01-04 04:38:18] <%$Mr_Monop> I wished you could just animation cancel the flask in Tunic at a minimum.
[2023-01-04 04:38:18] <%potapeno> wait theres a remake? thats really cool drgnrave
[2023-01-04 04:38:21] <%$Mr_Monop> I loved the puzzles though
[2023-01-04 04:38:22] <%+titzzzz93> cult of the lamb deserves a mention
[2023-01-04 04:38:25] <BirdOfChill> The DLC for Vampire Survivors has Yokai and Oni type charaters.
[2023-01-04 04:38:28] <%$jqck_89> NUGSDETECTED
[2023-01-04 04:38:29] <%StrongBelwas1014> Are we watching any GDQ runs as a family?
[2023-01-04 04:38:29] <BillyBobbyJones23> there was a switch game called astral chain man that companion mechanic was so cool
[2023-01-04 04:38:35] <teamLNCHBX> @titzzzz93 combat in that was also boring imo
[2023-01-04 04:38:35] <%TheGeohound> through much trial and error, I have learned to not play all the cards you're given in loop hero haha
[2023-01-04 04:38:40] <teamLNCHBX> but still a lot of fun
[2023-01-04 04:38:44] <%Khatun_> catJAM
[2023-01-04 04:38:45] <%buttercupsupreme1> @potapeno it was announced a couple weeks back
[2023-01-04 04:38:49] <teamLNCHBX> for real, so much potential
[2023-01-04 04:38:50] <%$Mr_Monop> Now I thought Death’s Door had fun combat though

[2023-01-04 04:39:05] <%drgnrave> @potapeno Yeah they are making a new game called Risk of Rain Returns, and showed off some gameplay. Looks really good. Bringing in ideas, survivors from RoR2, but still 2D
[2023-01-04 04:39:07] <%+shartmcbritches> this level would make me rage quit
[2023-01-04 04:39:16] <%y0ssarin> @mr_monop deaths door was amazing
[2023-01-04 04:39:17] <%WrathOfBom> they said some new content is coming for cult of the lamb...but what else can you add esp when you finish?
[2023-01-04 04:39:22] <x_MacAttack> what’s up everyone
[2023-01-04 04:39:25] <%$Fuzzwizzle> @BarbarousKing They are working on more content still for Cult of the Lamb
[2023-01-04 04:39:35] <%potapeno> i hope ror returns has better platforming, i hated the controls in RoR
[2023-01-04 04:39:36] <%playmykrat0s> They're adding new bosses to cult of the lamb and new weapons
[2023-01-04 04:39:41] <teamLNCHBX> unsighted, a must play imo for any metroidvania/zelda style games
[2023-01-04 04:39:41] <%potapeno> something just felt off

[2023-01-04 05:07:25] <%+toughToes> Barb did you see they are doing one final run of the super NT?
[2023-01-04 05:07:37] <%$The_Dog_Rules> Bannerlord feels like they don’t know how to make an end game
[2023-01-04 05:07:43] <BahamutOdin> Ooohhh I didn’t even notice the red gas.
[2023-01-04 05:07:47] <%+kaonnonn> it's slow at first with a lot of menuing, but the endgame smithing can get you 50k in an instant.
[2023-01-04 05:07:52] <%Khatun_> it's the best half-baked game I've ever played

[2023-01-04 15:03:45] <%IlllIIIlllIlIlIIllllIIIlI> @rabidwombat311 It's not each act, you can just have 4 different sets

[2023-01-04 15:04:08] <%rabidwombat311> @IlllIIIlllIlIlIIllllIIIlI don't they start empty? he only edited act 1

[2023-01-04 15:25:35] <+Azirale> Removing them lets you place another tile before next boss iirc
[2023-01-04 15:25:38] <%Alfonso_Khan> its still taking space for more useful stuff
[2023-01-04 15:25:44] <%LostHopeFate> DDoomer
[2023-01-04 15:26:08] <%$Ultrauberness> removing them helps the bar tho right? like the 2nd boss comes out slower?

[2023-01-04 15:26:44] <%+penguinfarm> @oKtosiTe this isn't some massively skill-based game - the character literally does the work for you so it's just making a few decisions barbShrug

[2023-01-04 15:27:16] <%+breadwatcher> @penguinfarm yeah its more of a strategy game rather than a skill game.
[2023-01-04 15:27:23] <%$MCoffeyMetal> one hit away from death - "kind of a close call"
[2023-01-04 15:27:24] <Binx12512> need damage all
[2023-01-04 15:27:27] <%sporkboots> the orbs determine playable locations, full green = in road, half green = next to road, all black - away from road

[2023-01-04 15:37:10] <%Rosisson> yeah, the necro has such an easier time against her
[2023-01-04 15:37:10] <Varsidian> I did the same thing, first sttempt against her was with necro and beat her on my first run with him. necro is too good
[2023-01-04 15:37:13] <%+WhiskeyWood> Feels like a retreat
[2023-01-04 15:37:17] <%+Omiweapon> it would be nice if you could change characters mid loop after a boss at some point
[2023-01-04 15:37:20] <XantyLeonhart> priestess is easy with the necro. The warrior is pretty good with counter and damage to all
[2023-01-04 15:37:29] <%Antog_____> i had a 30 loop run with rogue yesterday. was a PB for me
[2023-01-04 15:37:38] <%keith46256> probably a dumb question, but does it matter where you place village tiles?

[2023-01-04 15:37:50] <benjozaaaa> I didnt even try playing other classes after I unlocked necro, just beat first three chapters with it
[2023-01-04 15:37:50] <%manfred_bratwurst> bosses are a real knowledge check, first 2 can be trivialized
[2023-01-04 15:37:50] <%+DaMotorBoater> make sure you build every tier supply*

[2023-01-04 15:38:22] <%Kraelan> @keith46256 A few of the village tiles have specific location requirements.
[2023-01-04 15:38:26] <XantyLeonhart> hp growth is stupid on the warrior, i managed to get to loop 100 with the warrior once

[2023-01-04 15:38:36] <%sporkboots> yes gets summons out faster

[2023-01-04 15:38:40] <%DeNarm> a little, makes you summon faster

[2023-01-04 15:38:44] <%+johnpr> yes it does, you summon faster

[2023-01-04 15:38:45] <+Azirale> attaack speed helps because you get skellies out faster

[2023-01-04 15:38:53] <%+casteia> @BarbarousKing yes, some people play with 200% attack speed as necro
[2023-01-04 15:38:54] <%+Kressalak> Deserts are helpful
[2023-01-04 15:38:56] <%Kraelan> @keith46256 Specifically, the tile that unlocks the rogue has to be connected to the camp fire.
[2023-01-04 15:38:57] <%brandbool> necro is really cool but necro also feels cheesy for me barbShrug

[2023-01-04 15:40:08] <%Rosisson> the necro is not cheesy, his build is more generalist, the warrior you must change the build between bosses but I never did that LUL
[2023-01-04 15:40:09] <%Shiverwarp> I felt like necro can get carried a lot easier by certain traits when I played

[2023-01-04 15:40:16] <XantyLeonhart> necro has a skill that increases his shield everytime a skelly dies. If you place a lot of wood tiles and fight dummies, you can farm shield almost indefinetly.

[2023-01-04 15:56:57] <+texaspoontappa99> @sparknfire If you figure it out, let me know because I have been wondering the same.  I do not get this game at all
[2023-01-04 15:57:07] <%$iwerewolve> @sparknfire There are loops where you don't control your character but the 'tile' placement.  Tiles grant affinities, have synergies, and can spawn enemies. You can also change your equipment load out.
[2023-01-04 15:57:09] <%sparknfire> @texaspoontappa99 will do lmao

[2023-01-04 15:58:42] <%$iwerewolve> @sparknfire If you have a system that can play it I'd recommend it at $5,
[2023-01-04 15:58:52] <BMLN> after rly struggling with the necromancer, I would correct myself and add that he is so overpowered lsrCorndilly
[2023-01-04 15:59:01] <%DregBasher> there's also no real penalty to stacking it on necro like the stamina bar on warrior/rogue
[2023-01-04 15:59:09] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> attack speed wont drain your stamina either when summoning skeletons on the necro
[2023-01-04 15:59:09] <%$iwerewolve> @sparknfire I'm on a laptop so the track pad has screwed me a few times on placements
[2023-01-04 15:59:12] <%sparknfire> @iwerewolve dang, $5 I'll check it out, thanks for the info buddy
[2023-01-04 15:59:12] <+texaspoontappa99> @sparknfire it looks like it can run on a old nokia phone
[2023-01-04 15:59:12] <%+iceisnice> @sparknfire It is good on switch except I keep letting go of XL and XR a lot so I waste time on trying to place things.
[2023-01-04 15:59:14] <%BarbsKaizoThumb> Attack speed can stunt your warrior because of the stamina
[2023-01-04 15:59:16] <+seedmole> yeah the stat balancing is fun in this

[2023-01-04 16:00:38] <%nasagivii> is the number next to the equipment a level?
[2023-01-04 16:00:41] <%$mikemountain> how come barb doesn't place more forests along the river? are we waiting for different tiles for that?

[2023-01-04 16:03:35] <%nasagivii> whats the number next to the equipment

[2023-01-04 16:03:37] <XantyLeonhart> a standard strat with the necro is replacing the mountain tiles with desert since he doesn't really need the hp
[2023-01-04 16:03:38] <Varsidian> how about one more for the road? LUL
[2023-01-04 16:03:39] <%$iwerewolve> @BarbarousKing to be fair Hades is hard to follow unless you've played it.
[2023-01-04 16:03:44] <%Manon66> It gets more understandable if you play it yourself
[2023-01-04 16:03:47] <%$romashkoo> I have no idea what placing rocks and rivers on a map does
[2023-01-04 16:03:53] <%+ravenjest> why do people come into a stream and go "what is this" when google exists ....
[2023-01-04 16:03:54] <%+iceisnice> @architect37 I was waiting for a year for to be on sale and finally got it when I saw a sale
[2023-01-04 16:03:58] <%$mikemountain> what's noisier, a full loop in this or vampire survivors after 25 mins?

[2023-01-04 16:04:23] <gurustriminga> What happens when you fill up the map?
[2023-01-04 16:04:26] <%+ravenjest> @ravenjest chat is always wrong
[2023-01-04 16:04:28] <%Nabecoat> @romashkoo small buffs that add up over time. Rocks give more HP, forest more attack speed. River doubles the bonus of rock and river next to it
[2023-01-04 16:04:28] <XantyLeonhart> @XantyLeonhart yes but thats what you want so they suicide into the dummies and you stack your shield up to infinity

[2023-01-04 16:06:29] <%$iwerewolve> @zgreen223 It makes a ton more sense if you play it because you ease into things rather than being thrown.

[2023-01-04 16:14:51] <%DeNarm> sometimes you need to shuffle a little and get that summon quality from another piece of equipment
[2023-01-04 16:14:51] <%martii_1205> @bluefaintingpig more like fade to black
[2023-01-04 16:14:52] <LiLLMentaL> make the quality back with another ring

[2023-01-04 16:15:07] <%Nabecoat> @bluefaintingpig definitely fade to black
[2023-01-04 16:15:08] <JustSmileMan_o7> @TheLaw86 A lvl 1 and lvl 60 ring will still have +1 skeleton, for example. +quality scales from +17% on lvl 1 items to +22% on lvl 50 items, and yet they take up absurd amount of itemization due to how they work.
[2023-01-04 16:15:08] <Varsidian> the 5th skelly is i think completely immune once summoned

[2023-01-04 16:15:24] <%+denm101> they never attack tho
[2023-01-04 16:15:27] <Jemsuper> Do you need more attack speed at this point? Maybe mountains on the river is needed now
[2023-01-04 16:15:29] <%+lordsynth> yeah the ranged skeletons cant be damaged
[2023-01-04 16:15:31] <medievalberserk> good thing is skeleton archers in the back cant be killed

[2023-01-04 16:15:51] <%hazmatt5000> @lordsynth it's because it's 2× + 2x + 2x. it stacks additively

[2023-01-04 16:18:54] <medievalberserk> yea would lose alot
[2023-01-04 16:19:09] <%$iwerewolve> I generally skimp quality for level and quantity
[2023-01-04 16:19:10] <JustSmileMan_o7> 20% quality not worth losing several levels.

[2023-01-04 16:19:26] <Varsidian> hearing the sound of receiving an 'orb of expansion' is so Kreygasm

[2023-01-04 16:19:27] <$PatrickMJones> There was a secondary stat that added extra level, that's why
[2023-01-04 16:19:33] <%TheMindKiller> @LiLLMentaL not looking at all the bonus stats which had more levels in there
[2023-01-04 16:19:33] <+CountRiario> @lillmental you are not. it says level twice on the first one.
[2023-01-04 16:19:37] <LiLLMentaL> 5.3 to 4.9 ? 0.4 difference?

[2023-01-04 16:19:42] <JustSmileMan_o7> Quantity until 4>levels>quantity until 7/8 > quality
[2023-01-04 16:19:42] <%$iwerewolve> @LiLLMentaL for items it's number and background color to get a general idea of strength
[2023-01-04 16:19:47] <LiLLMentaL> oooo
[2023-01-04 16:19:51] <eatingpotatoes25> is orange the best rarity???

[2023-01-04 16:19:52] <%hazmatt5000> @lordsynth If you place a thicket with 3 rivers around it you end up getting +12% attack speed barbShrug I think instead of the river's effect stacking, it helps to think of them each applying it's own multiplicative effect separately to the same tile
[2023-01-04 16:19:55] <%$Royal_Ruckus> @LiLLMentaL 1.2 and 0.2 bonus level

[2023-01-04 16:59:23] <%+Beefyfife> @barbarousking what’s the base magic shield? I think you’ve summoned like a 1000 skeles in this run so far
[2023-01-04 16:59:29] <%+dcboizero> actually attack speed only applies to summon speed and slap once maxed out
[2023-01-04 16:59:30] <%+henzdn> you'll need to put more battle tiles

[2023-01-04 17:00:41] <%TRSLackluster> you need a bridge for more rivers

[2023-01-04 17:01:08] <%+dcboizero> no it just lets you move through road
[2023-01-04 17:01:09] <%Rayethimmortalus> only 1 river per map

[2023-01-04 17:35:53] <+MarMar0326> We drove to Florida in the early 90s, and our initial plan was to drive up north and down the east coast and then return along the gulf coast to Texas and back north to Nebraska. At the last minute, my parents switched it because everyone was talking about a possible bad hurricane. Hurricane Andrew hit the gulf coast and absolutely wrecked all the shit the day after we left Florida.

[2023-01-04 18:21:16] <%+morse314> taco mac here in atlanta has a 'death' sauce that I truly actually enjoy. they discontinued it, but there's a distinction between spicy food, and good food that is spicy.

[2023-01-04 18:21:23] <%+mdimmett> I watched Alton Brown make wings with a Carolina Reaper sauce and it hurt my eyes from about 200 feet away
[2023-01-04 18:21:23] <%AwesomeMattG> I feed off of the pain of the hot.
[2023-01-04 18:21:24] <%bluefaintingpig> I love good hot wings

[2023-01-04 18:21:26] <%+ohlawdhecomin> Habanero is fucked up so often.  it had such a nice floral taste that's rarely ever done right

[2023-01-04 18:21:34] <%Nabecoat> There's a point where spicy food becomes ONLY spicy, and not good tasting. That's when I don't like it anymore
[2023-01-04 18:21:38] <%$GreenFerret95> I've tried some of the hottest but it ruins the wing imo

[2023-01-04 18:21:39] <%WiLDRAGE777> I just don't like stuff which is Vinigar based spicy, though.
[2023-01-04 18:21:45] <%$macdreinthebae> A local Pub in my area had “Nuclear” wings and at the time was their hottest. They have hotter wings now but the place is called Keystone Pub. Great place.
[2023-01-04 18:21:45] <%bracketmanps> hot sauces have diminishing returns in that regard - the hottest stuff doesn't taste great
[2023-01-04 18:21:47] <%EmoDylanRen> my grandpa would wear a sweatband while eating spicy food

[2023-01-04 18:44:56] <+seedmole> cream soda rules
[2023-01-04 18:44:56] <%Whyeverso> It's definitely possible
[2023-01-04 18:44:59] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> You can figure it out, but some of the quests require a lot of experimentation
[2023-01-04 18:44:59] <%cloudhppr> what
[2023-01-04 18:45:00] <%$Macrophaje> The notebook helps
[2023-01-04 18:45:01] <+garyoakguy> Yeah because of the bomber's notebook

[2023-01-04 18:45:02] <%toxicpycnometer> there is a journal for that

[2023-01-04 18:45:03] <%RunningParallel> @bolthus sounds like the words of somebody who used a guide
[2023-01-04 18:45:03] <%+shlomodude> i know you don't play some games as much due to low viewer count, but will there be a hot wheels night sometime soon?
[2023-01-04 18:45:03] <%+heyitsnovabound> orange cream is incredible
[2023-01-04 18:45:10] <%Reishiyo> It'd take a long time with a lot of trial and error without a guide.
[2023-01-04 18:45:10] <KOOLSM0KE> just about as hard as completing earthbound without a guide LUL
[2023-01-04 18:45:10] <%meinsaft> if you are an adult with a job, just use a guide.

[2023-01-04 18:45:10] <%Mr_Panda> that's like castlevania 2 with no guide

[2023-01-04 18:45:12] <%$kingofgames323> I had the Prima guide
[2023-01-04 18:45:12] <%TheNewScene> Cream soda + vanilla ice cream = youre moshing
[2023-01-04 18:45:12] <%Joypen> what the fuck is a cream soda?
[2023-01-04 18:45:18] <%Nymh79> On a super rare occasion I'll find myself enjoying vanilla cream soda.

[2023-01-04 18:45:21] <+aSpacemanIAm> Yeah it's rough
[2023-01-04 18:45:21] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> Fierce Deity mask *is* the coolest thing ever
[2023-01-04 18:45:21] <%CarbonAxiom> That's the hardest one
[2023-01-04 18:45:22] <%+topo_grande> that was my favorite LUL
[2023-01-04 18:45:23] <%+agchee> It's hard cause some masks take a lot of time & precise things to get.
[2023-01-04 18:45:23] <%+Spopovich678> its pretty awful
[2023-01-04 18:45:24] <woodsterin97> YES

[2023-01-04 18:45:31] <Liefington> i couldn't even make it through basegame without guide. stupid time related events
[2023-01-04 18:45:32] <%karlgerm> that one was so many retries as a kid
[2023-01-04 18:45:35] <%+Misssster_Anderson> yeah, getting the Kafei mask or whatever is a pain in the balls

[2023-01-04 18:45:46] <KOOLSM0KE> The history of MM is pretty cool though.
[2023-01-04 18:45:46] <+Bigbenrox> did u enjoy contra?
[2023-01-04 18:45:47] <%TiniTinyTONY> OOT is far superior
[2023-01-04 18:45:47] <+aSpacemanIAm> I mean both have their flaws for sure
[2023-01-04 18:45:48] <%$Metallichepe> that one and the graveyard mask without guide is ooff
[2023-01-04 18:45:49] <bolthus> ?? Literally every step is hinted by NPCs and the notebook
[2023-01-04 18:45:49] <%cloudhppr> wrong
[2023-01-04 18:45:51] <%$Blastphemy1290> @Varsidian damn chat just gives anyone permission hobbBrow
[2023-01-04 18:45:52] <%Clickums> OoT aged better for sure
[2023-01-04 18:45:52] <%+topo_grande> OOT has better dungeons
[2023-01-04 18:45:53] <%GravyTime> I just don't care for Zelda games at all
[2023-01-04 18:45:54] <%karlgerm> OOT is still fun even after playing Randomizers which is very nice
[2023-01-04 18:45:55] <%theBonestorm> Very much agree Clap
[2023-01-04 18:45:56] <%+Nevarky> The thing is, that's is very unique for a zelda game, so it gets a lot of points
[2023-01-04 18:45:56] <%TheGeohound> Majora's mask has deeper concept and emotion then oot. oot is a better game hands down
[2023-01-04 18:45:59] <%$OzienRG> hot take: 3d zelda < top down zelda
[2023-01-04 18:45:59] <$MCoffeyMetal> big agree
[2023-01-04 18:45:59] <%+Lvnthedream17> bet?

[2023-01-04 18:46:04] <%+dubiousdinobot> still both good
[2023-01-04 18:46:05] <%+GaimeGuy> MM is probably my favorite game
[2023-01-04 18:46:06] <Varsidian> shocker, the rose tinted glasses are especially opaque when it comes to zelda
[2023-01-04 18:46:07] <woodsterin97> You hate it? barbGPW3 barbGPW3 barbGabnon barbGabnon :) :)
[2023-01-04 18:46:07] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> OoT is a more polished experience, but I admire the originality and willingness to experiment that Nintendo had for MM
[2023-01-04 18:46:09] <%benjammin172> I don't think it's flawless, it's just great because it mixes up the same old zelda formula. I'd like to see them do something a bit different
[2023-01-04 18:46:11] <%fesinax> have you played an elden ring randomizer?
[2023-01-04 18:46:11] <%+Mraubewon> Contra or banjo haha
[2023-01-04 18:46:12] <%+PinkPowerRanger19> pause for Barb Zelda tier list?
[2023-01-04 18:46:13] <%PonysPlace> I just have so much more memories of MM. so fucking weird and exciting
[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <%$deltahedge0> One more dungeon in MM and it is superior to OoT
[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <%a_lemon> And having to restart the whole cycle if you mess up on the last day in that quest was the WORST
[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <%$jorwul> majoras mask is very unique
[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <%benjammin172> I'd love a modern more scifi inspired zelda
[2023-01-04 18:46:22] <%barrythechopper_> @nymh79 i got that everytime at the theatre
[2023-01-04 18:46:23] <%meinsaft> BARB WHEN END BET
[2023-01-04 18:46:24] <jmillz11> Majoras is good because it’s different and creative. OoT is a nearly perfect execution of the zelda formula.
[2023-01-04 18:46:27] <%qbranch_> 155?
[2023-01-04 18:46:28] <woodsterin97> @pinkpowerranger19 he did one a few months ago
[2023-01-04 18:46:29] <%Mr_Android> I'm definitely in the MM over OoT camp
[2023-01-04 18:46:32] <%$Blastphemy1290> i hated MM so much as a kid its hard not to hate it now
[2023-01-04 18:46:32] <%Raiyzar> I wis hthey would expand on MM. I would love to learn more about the mask's power
[2023-01-04 18:46:32] <%$razovega> barbKriby
[2023-01-04 18:46:33] <%$Papa_TheBard> i like contra but i only play each one about 4 hours then im done

[2023-01-04 18:46:39] <%saigio> people that roleplay that Majoras Mask isn't a step up from OoT have some serious rose tinted goggles
[2023-01-04 18:46:40] <%rummmmhammmm> doesnt sound very hard core

[2023-01-04 18:46:44] <%bizangles> I remember people hated Majora's Mask when it came out. I think it's grown on people, but it'll never be as good as OOT
[2023-01-04 18:46:47] <+SouixLive> Contra is tough
[2023-01-04 18:46:47] <%$razovega> Would you rather go into the past and meet your ancestors or go into the future and meet your great-great grandchildren?
[2023-01-04 18:46:50] <%Mr_Panda> majora just doesnt come together as a whole as well, it has all these rough edges

[2023-01-04 19:11:58] <%TheLaw86> actually, its becoming the opposite.  They are tired of the identity being anti-dem, instead of conservative
[2023-01-04 19:11:58] <%+R1NZL3R_87> @BarbarousKing McCarthy has lost his vote bid four time so far. Meanwhile Dems are all unified behind their one candidate and just twiddling their thumbs. LUL

[2023-01-04 19:12:06] <%Armagaren> they should all be broken up
[2023-01-04 19:12:07] <%mcsmith012> basically the margins in the house are so small, that they need full consensus, because all the democrats are united in showing up to make sure they keep needing that consensus for the vote to go through
[2023-01-04 19:12:07] <%NeuMeu> this is what happens when they splinter

[2023-01-04 19:12:12] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> Nah, it won't fracture. Division would kill both parts of it. But it will change and probably for the worse
[2023-01-04 19:12:12] <%doubled49> I could see Republican party splitting

[2023-01-04 19:12:43] <%ampliDude7> in europe this happens all the time
[2023-01-04 19:12:43] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> The problem with getting rid of the two-party system is that both parties would have to agree to do it

[2023-01-04 19:12:51] <%+LinkOdinson> We’re two party and cannot change unless we become like a ranked choice system
[2023-01-04 19:12:51] <BMLN> yeah, thats insane

[2023-01-04 19:12:58] <%$Doug_E_Fresh4> true. that's why we have all these issues here. the two party system sucks

[2023-01-04 19:13:09] <%Freelancesplitterz> there are 3 major parties in canada, around 5 big enough to talk about @BarbarousKing

[2023-01-04 19:13:10] <%CarbonAxiom> They're fake parties though, they basically all coalesce into 2 sides for the most part
[2023-01-04 19:13:10] <Etiennera> Canada has 3-4?
[2023-01-04 19:13:10] <%Manon66> Most have many more. The 2 party system is an artifact of the US using the first past the post system
[2023-01-04 19:13:10] <%+FrayedBristles> 2 only matter in most systems
[2023-01-04 19:13:11] <+Bomberbro02> I wonder if libertarians would actually know what to do if they get In office cuz they most likely expect to lose

[2023-01-04 19:13:20] <%$Septomor> Israel is cool, you vote for a party and the proportions of the total vote get sent to the legislative for representation
[2023-01-04 19:13:20] <@%$DanTheVP> They have 2 but they still have to form coalitions with smaller parties to get a majority, UK is VERY different
[2023-01-04 19:13:21] <%$felipe_queens> the plonks and the pluckers
[2023-01-04 19:13:21] <%foryourhealth> Bring back whigs and torries

[2023-01-04 19:13:24] <%+gabe_the_engineer> proportional representation also leads to extreme factions dominating the platforms
[2023-01-04 19:13:24] <%the_mmx> Here in Russia we have 1 party democratic system KEKW

[2023-01-04 19:13:27] <acewing216> There's actually a weird rule that limits the debates to only the main two parties.
[2023-01-04 19:13:27] <%flex_mentalo> Italy and Israel have proportional representation and have like 10+ parties in their legislatures
[2023-01-04 19:13:28] <%+RoyalD1> canada had 4, but 2 main ones, and then some smaller ones
[2023-01-04 19:13:28] <%a_lemon> But my Green party D:
[2023-01-04 19:13:29] <%Bear_Byte> duverger's law - voting systems favor certain numbers of parties
[2023-01-04 19:13:29] <Vyrlokar> In Spain, it's 2 big ones and many small, but the small ones are not irrelevant
[2023-01-04 19:13:30] <%+slairf> The problem with the US political system, we have tons of third party parties, however, the DNC and RNC have rule over debates and set rules up so that third parties can never attend them and get air time
[2023-01-04 19:13:30] <%Azur85> In Canada, we seesaw between our two regular parties, but we have the option for minority parliaments, which is what we have now
[2023-01-04 19:13:31] <%+kramer31877> Special Interests won't spend their money on the other parties
[2023-01-04 19:13:31] <@%$DanTheVP> the UK small parties are very relevant, nothing like the US
[2023-01-04 19:13:31] <%+the_onetrue_fist> like the green party in Canada
[2023-01-04 19:13:32] <%Lika_sika> but only two in congress
[2023-01-04 19:13:32] <Falzy212> UK has the SNP and lib dems who get some seats and have some power
[2023-01-04 19:13:33] <%+BeyondJon> Ross Perot was the most successful third party individual

[2023-01-04 19:13:45] <%Spaminal> It doesn't help that our "third" parties are often even more batshit than the main two.

[2023-01-04 19:23:40] <%Robocurious> crafting dlc Kreygasm
[2023-01-04 19:23:41] <%StrongBelwas1014> That's a bit outside of thinking it is useful in a normal playthrough.  Nice to craft weapon buffs, fall damage reduction, grenades, etc.  The other games I barely used that stuff
[2023-01-04 19:23:43] <%$ThereIsNoTriforce> damnit he's right
[2023-01-04 19:23:43] <%$joshy0302> It does change the economy a bit, in that you don't have to spend runes on items, you can just craft them.
[2023-01-04 19:23:47] <%$VendettaSMA> @geenareeno he did have some random bosses spawn in and die instantly

[2023-01-04 19:27:21] <%$Restredainted> @GnuHope I'd give horizon about an 8, GoW would probably be around an 8 aswell if I finished it. ER bored the shit out of me, for more or less the reasons Barb is explaining. the side dungeons are worthless. exploring for hours for no reward.

[2023-01-04 19:28:16] <%theBonestorm> Doood, weapon so OP brah
[2023-01-04 19:28:17] <%BennyWhatever> A lot of the dungeons give you Spirit Summon upgrade materials, which is relevant for most people
[2023-01-04 19:28:18] <%Tim_fishh> yeah they were cool exactly once

[2023-01-04 19:28:35] <%$Doug_E_Fresh4> you're looking for purpose
[2023-01-04 19:28:42] <%+penguinfarm> semantics

[2023-01-04 19:28:50] <%bware001> My ng+ of Elden ring took my like 3 hours
[2023-01-04 19:28:51] <%+IdolizeDT> i literally quit because I have an issue leaving things behind and I got SO ANNOYED with how many useless side dungeons. I feel compelled though because what if THIS one has something good in it
[2023-01-04 19:28:51] <KOOLSM0KE> as a streamer your way of playing is so much different than a casual who has 75% less gaming time.
[2023-01-04 19:28:51] <illogicali> this is my exact same problem with botw. open world games suck
[2023-01-04 19:28:55] <%$SuperBirdcat> well there kind of is, but they contain a mechanic that you have no interest in
[2023-01-04 19:28:55] <Woweeez> Dungeons are the same as chalice dungeons

[2023-01-04 19:28:57] <%buypurpleflurp> Yeah, no, I get that.  The crafting could be better
[2023-01-04 19:29:03] <%$simian_spirit_guide> Maybe the side dungeons are optional for barbChad  gamers like me and you who dont use spirit ash. But for the common masses who need to summon to beat every boss the side dungeons are needed
[2023-01-04 19:29:04] <%$crizotibin> you can see it in your elden ring replays, you never enter in any dungeon or cave at all
[2023-01-04 19:29:08] <%+MiloticMaster2> yeah one thing I dislike about open-world games are how dry all the optional content is
[2023-01-04 19:29:08] <%+BougiePower> hey barb, have you completed all post content of Kirby Forgotten Land?
[2023-01-04 19:29:09] <%TheNewScene> video game people love saying OP
[2023-01-04 19:29:18] <%$ShelbyvilleThrillhouse> it's too easy to just ride a horse and collect all the shit you need to make the game easy once you've played it
[2023-01-04 19:29:18] <%N_Boomer> kind of like the subweapons in sekiro being very limited in usefulness?
[2023-01-04 19:29:21] <%valse_01> imagine if you had to gather components and craft the medallion of rhold to use the lift, that would be sweet
[2023-01-04 19:29:21] <%$Mi4_Slayer> open these cheeks barbCheeky
[2023-01-04 19:29:22] <$Devetr> I like the semi-open world of the Dark Souls games. Elden Ring is just too fucking big.
[2023-01-04 19:29:23] <%+breadwatcher> @MiloticMaster2 yeah optional content should be wet.

[2023-01-04 19:29:39] <IgnoreMySub> open world doesn't add anything to the game if the game doesn't interact with it in a meaningful way

[2023-01-04 19:29:40] <%Eadine> its a difficult balance because the more necessary they make them the more cumbersome repeat playthroughs are because you have to do 50 side dungeons to progress

[2023-01-04 19:32:21] <%CarbonAxiom> @poppenhoffer This, this is what makes it a good thing. Sure, more of those optional areas could have been given more use, but overall the design is a great one. ER at least has a design where multiple paths lead to the end, rewarding exploration (even if not everything you find is useful)
[2023-01-04 19:32:21] <+Eshecutioner> bruh ive said it before and ill say it again: thunderblight ganon, one of the hardest bosses in gaming. period. soulsbourne-level of difficulty. BOOSHIT
[2023-01-04 19:32:23] <jmillz11> Everything scales with you in botw. You get stronger, so do the enemies and weapons. It just stays at one difficulty
[2023-01-04 19:32:24] <%Azur85> Zelda 2 is great. Death Mountain was probably a big roadblock for everyone

[2023-01-04 19:39:41] <%SolveForX_> I’ve unironically played the messenger through 7+ times, it’s amazing
[2023-01-04 19:39:42] <BriMikon> The Messenger is one of the funniest games ever!
[2023-01-04 19:39:43] <%wolftickets88> I got alien isolation for free on epic. GREAT SUCCESS!
[2023-01-04 19:39:45] <%+ZingDingaLing> BabyRage it's too hard
[2023-01-04 19:39:45] <%foryourhealth> Tbh never played Celeste
[2023-01-04 19:39:48] <%kit05> Hollow Knight was a bit easy, it went by too fast
[2023-01-04 19:39:48] <Briskly_gaming> some of the A sides in celeste go on for a bit too long
[2023-01-04 19:39:48] <%Azur85> Even if it's too hard, they have options to make it easier barbShrug
[2023-01-04 19:39:50] <%alucard835> the Messenger DLC for me was too hard platforming, definitely skill issue
[2023-01-04 19:39:57] <%+SirLoathe> its too wholesome
[2023-01-04 19:39:57] <kansascityshuffle00> everything
[2023-01-04 19:39:57] <%FrsMns> Oh that's the Cyberdemon music!
[2023-01-04 19:39:57] <Scones12345> If you don't like Celeste you just don't like platformers
[2023-01-04 19:39:57] <%$felipe_queens> bophades
[2023-01-04 19:39:58] <Drovan> BabyRage i died a lot and gave up
[2023-01-04 19:39:58] <%bizangles> It's "too hard" but it also has amazing accessibility options to make it super easy
[2023-01-04 19:39:58] <%$probird5> its too good
[2023-01-04 19:39:58] <bombquistador> Celeste sucks cause im bad at platformsra
[2023-01-04 19:39:59] <%Hlantian> The insistence of using the speed tech stuff in some later levels, but other than that
[2023-01-04 19:39:59] <%+Old_Yharnam> Hades is like 15$. Insanity
[2023-01-04 19:40:00] <%$hal_____> you even have a lot of granular accessibility options if it's too hard
[2023-01-04 19:40:00] <bolthus> game too good, made me sad I couldn't play it for the first time ever again?
[2023-01-04 19:40:00] <%+Drdevice81> celeste isn't my style of game but even I'll admit it's great
[2023-01-04 19:40:01] <%+marimbaman49> Celeste can be hard but it has tons of accessibility
[2023-01-04 19:40:01] <%$GameFillip> ITS TOO HAWD >:((
[2023-01-04 19:40:04] <%even_my_cat_hates_me> Mario Maker is far bettern than Celeste.
[2023-01-04 19:40:05] <%+comrade_lucifer> its too woke
[2023-01-04 19:40:05] <%ZizoElewa> crungo game
[2023-01-04 19:40:05] <%+IdolizeDT> If you don't enjoy celeste because it's too hard then turn on assist mode and make it easier. The game gives you that option
[2023-01-04 19:40:08] <%HeyMisterJack> wave cheating? barbCheat
[2023-01-04 19:40:08] <%Polymono> Obviously it’s the woke agenda that’s the biggest issue ;)
[2023-01-04 19:40:10] <schnydeps> Alundra 2
[2023-01-04 19:40:10] <%dulcet_tone> i mean if you dont like platformers its definately not for you

[2023-01-04 19:40:11] <%$Papa_TheBard> @foryourhealth so your opinion that it sucks means absolutley nothing.. got it
[2023-01-04 19:40:12] <%sirloofa> Do you have an intended path here?
[2023-01-04 19:40:13] <%BarbsKaizoThumb> The shop keeper alone makes the Messenger worth it
[2023-01-04 19:40:13] <%bizangles> Farewell is really long
[2023-01-04 19:40:14] <%+ScreamyYellyGamer> it was 5 dollars over the steam holiday sales, fantastic price and I am loving the game (even though its difficult for me in some places)
[2023-01-04 19:40:15] <%ApogeeRL> less fun when it gets super techy
[2023-01-04 19:40:16] <+sevaul> Hat in Time; another great game
[2023-01-04 19:40:18] <%$calmchals> Celeste is just too fun
[2023-01-04 19:40:18] <%Seda_Give> Actual skill issue AND bad taste

[2023-01-04 19:40:21] <%AwesomeVolkner> Celeste doesn't really encourage "getting better" (at least A-side). Because each section is so short, I basically got through it getting lucky

[2023-01-04 19:40:29] <%saigio> people who hate celeste either hate it because they are terrible at it or because some chud told them its "woke" and therefore bad

[2023-01-04 19:41:00] <%kit05> @awesomevolkner but you did get better, regardless of you think that way or not
[2023-01-04 19:41:01] <%bizangles> I like that the strawberries are pointless
[2023-01-04 19:41:01] <%+GeneralKDI> I hate how this music keep changing side (left, right)
[2023-01-04 19:41:03] <PlasticAutomaton> As someone with depression, Celeste fuckin' broke me. Such a damn good game, though I wasn't good enough to clear B sides.
[2023-01-04 19:41:03] <%JOHUshy> I feel I'd like Farewell better if it's separated into A,B,C sides

[2023-01-04 19:41:19] <%+Smartoss> I only played the A sides had a great time
[2023-01-04 19:41:20] <%vesipera> Wasn't Farewell a DLC originally?
[2023-01-04 19:41:26] <%$Metallichepe> PeepoPiano
[2023-01-04 19:41:29] <%+zaney2k> doing 100% in most games are shit
[2023-01-04 19:41:31] <%bizangles> 100% is just all the regular strawberries
[2023-01-04 19:41:33] <%Azur85> Base game is super solid. Then Chapters 8 and 9 were good bonus
[2023-01-04 19:41:33] <%Polymono> @vesipera yes
[2023-01-04 19:41:34] <%+DokuHimora> I'm guessing the enemies here are supposed to be spiders?

[2023-01-04 19:41:37] <%$ChunkyStumps> some of the regular strawberries were silly too
[2023-01-04 19:41:39] <%ZizoElewa> I would agree, there's a ton of content, I still find the game meh, I got to final chapter and just stopped not even due to too hard

[2023-01-04 19:42:12] <%Magnatux> the 8 bit celeste was really fun for a "mini" game
[2023-01-04 19:42:12] <%AwesomeVolkner> @kit05 sure, to an extent. but in say, Dark Souls, after I finally kill a boss, I could go back to it and probably do it again in 1-2 tries. But in Celeste, it'd take just as many attempts as the first time after a while
[2023-01-04 19:42:13] <%bizangles> There are some good mods for Grounded

[2023-01-04 19:42:20] <%WolfGuy423> i was burnt out by the time i hit the end game in grounded

[2023-01-04 19:52:47] <%+SignatoryRhyme> @TigeltoN it needs a estus like system too

[2023-01-04 19:55:29] <%+IdolizeDT> Elden Ring not having an unlocked framerate is quite disappointing in the era of even consoles having 120Hz support. In my opinion, AAA titles that have a PC release should have an unlocked framerate (or a really high cap, in DOOM 2016 at 200 for example). I know that we don't NEED it but refusing to make the experience better in way that provides no negatives to the gameplay is just...eh

[2023-01-04 20:05:51] <%CarbonAxiom> @Blastphemy1290 I can understand Sekiro, it's very much its own thing. I think you should give ER another chance, but you probably shouldn't play it like a pure open world game if you don't like exploring. Just go straight to the legacy dungeons, those are among the best in any From game imo

[2023-01-04 23:59:51] <$alex_melted_> So my last job was working at McDonald's, but I got sacked aye, 'caus I ah stole all the cookin' oil, poured it all over the car park mate, turnin' it into a drift ring hey. People pullin' in for Maccas didn't even know they were participatin'. Man, never seen a Camry slide like that! Straight into the lamp pole mate, it was super mad.
