[2023-01-08 13:05:38] <Litowy> Chat, ATK, perhaps you know by yourself or you know someone who could tell me. I have 1500+ GT Destroyer alt. When you enter the gravity mode (press „Z”), you can actaully press it another time to use that active skill. Is it worth pressing? Should I press it at the beginning or maybe at the very end? Or maybe not press it at all to bonk harder/faster/longer? I can't find the answer anywhere.

[2023-01-08 17:09:13] <Munnes> and even with support you had like 2 minutes left, so imagine you need to do double the damage in that amount of time
[2023-01-08 17:09:20] <+mentaI___> it took mr park so long to finally beat it solo

[2023-01-08 17:24:54] <%AyeJSuave> Do not watch the filler it’s pointless you can skip it. @imdafiend
[2023-01-08 17:25:02] <+Dawnwolf> @imdafiend Start from the beginning, give it at least 25 episodes (the first 18 episodes are very different from the rest of the series). It's very long so use a guide to skip the filler for the older seasons
[2023-01-08 17:25:06] <opwp_madruski> did gunslinger get any changes?
[2023-01-08 17:25:19] <+imdafiend> ok chat I'll use a guide. I hate filler lol

[2023-01-08 17:27:42] <EnragedPyro> i want a new Deep/Dark Gundam anime. im  only few episode in of the new one and im not a fan so far.
[2023-01-08 17:27:44] <+funkymunkytv> I think bleach was either the first or second anime I've ever watched so nostalgic.
[2023-01-08 17:27:45] <+Razerock> So for G1 its the same as normal except for the stagger check at x80 and the arrow blocking at x40? (and obviously more damage and hp)
[2023-01-08 17:27:52] <kimoleee112> cant wait for next season!
[2023-01-08 17:28:01] <Rafaelkh> yeah, its much more serious

[2023-01-08 18:51:22] <+Azurins> btw why do u guys use innana at 110?
