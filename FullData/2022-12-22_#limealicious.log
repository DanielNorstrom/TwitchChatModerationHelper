[2022-12-22 00:00:01] <@%$NekomataMaid> the skill is dodging any attacks from the enemies when theres more than one
[2022-12-22 00:00:04] <%thatcrazycrabs> "Twitch Snipers: I'm always ready..."

[2022-12-22 00:00:22] <+camo_tnt> @Laimubot would it not be easier to use a phone for that
[2022-12-22 00:00:28] <%thatcrazycrabs> @NekomataMaid ...So it's the Callisto skill check?
[2022-12-22 00:00:33] <justabot9696> LUL

[2022-12-22 00:00:54] <%+Dragonforce718> don't go down that rabbit hole
[2022-12-22 00:00:58] <Tolrath1> AP is for Physical techs
[2022-12-22 00:01:03] <nazufluff> Ooh
[2022-12-22 00:01:03] <@%Kovubot> limesSip
[2022-12-22 00:01:04] <%+Dragonforce718> best move is ap related

[2022-12-22 00:01:17] <Tolrath1> I think at point Lime had Exploder Blade
[2022-12-22 00:01:22] <!%Laimubot> evening limes and night each, and 6 are post-game I think it
[2022-12-22 00:01:22] <%SoulTea> Is there omnislash in this game?
[2022-12-22 00:01:23] <+ghost_mira> AP = Anal Penetration
[2022-12-22 00:01:33] <+ghost_mira> no RIP AND TEAR
[2022-12-22 00:01:39] <%jakebikay> @Laimubot limesOk
[2022-12-22 00:01:44] <justabot9696> use what you like its fine
[2022-12-22 00:01:45] <dresden81> it's not too hard to switch builds if you need to
[2022-12-22 00:01:45] <%SoulTea> magic seems to be alright for not maybe later when you start hitting too hard for the game to handle
[2022-12-22 00:01:48] <official_pig_wrestler> evening limes and night limes are poggers
[2022-12-22 00:01:51] <%+denizium> I mean, if they keep pulling out the magic-proof enemies...
[2022-12-22 00:01:53] <%BestyVT> my best move is AP related and I'm gonna use it to kill @ghost_mira for their crimes
[2022-12-22 00:02:16] <+ghost_mira> @BestyVT do it coward
[2022-12-22 00:02:17] <%SoulTea> wait what level is trifiraga?

[2022-12-22 00:04:33] <Tolrath1> Lets just say, it takes a LONG time to defeat it, even with the best stuff
[2022-12-22 00:04:47] <justabot9696> LUL
[2022-12-22 00:05:03] <dresden81> Put some more ATK into that ATK++
[2022-12-22 00:05:03] <+ghost_mira> @DarkShadowRage if you do the damage cap of 9999 with every hit you only need to hit them 7,700 times lmao

[2022-12-22 00:05:45] <dresden81> I think it's worth it
[2022-12-22 00:06:01] <$qlaxis> like the super boss in ff12 level of annoying
[2022-12-22 00:06:09] <+ghost_mira> Would you use them in combat anyway, or horde them for later and never use them

[2022-12-22 00:07:31] <%+MoltenMermaid> Is it bad that I examine the words of Laimubot and other AI and then pay attention to my own speech patterns and realize that my words too make little sense, especially in Twitch chat? limesD
[2022-12-22 00:07:38] <%thatcrazycrabs> I heard he even helps puppies on the weekend.
