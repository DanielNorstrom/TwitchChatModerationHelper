[2022-12-08 20:52:33] <JojimomxD_Ogen1> @FenoHS I just noticed an error with the firestone decktracker. There is a function that makes you track what runes the opponent has used. However, the tracker seems to think discovering an undead rune card means playing with undead runes in general. Since you know "the guy", maybe this can be fixed.

[2022-12-08 21:15:45] <eyvyjones> i prefer they delete fucking guff
[2022-12-08 21:15:47] <raphyourpapa> that way
[2022-12-08 21:15:49] <Mikitko> it would be nice to play OP DK instead of old ddecks
[2022-12-08 21:15:49] <anak_krakatau> what I'm surprised about is that I very rarely see Daddy D, even tho so many people were afraid of it
[2022-12-08 21:15:55] <HellrulesTv> u want the whole community to cry? And play weapon rogue meta?
[2022-12-08 21:15:56] <%+WildKarrde11> Trying to properly balance initially is the right call

[2022-12-08 21:16:14] <%Ben_Morrow> other way gives players free dust, this way doesn't  fenoStein
[2022-12-08 21:16:14] <%DrakeAcula> no, they will just leave cards by the wayside this way
[2022-12-08 21:16:14] <omeismm> they were scared of release dh so they made dk "fair"
[2022-12-08 21:16:15] <2Kawaii4_U> i was honestly surprised dk wasnt bonkers considering the strength of release dh in comparison
[2022-12-08 21:16:20] <DmichaelB0> D6 warlock was one of the most fun decks I've played tbh
[2022-12-08 21:16:20] <%FenoHS_Official> KEKWait tarantula the nuts
[2022-12-08 21:16:20] <hohlage> @fenohs yooooo bro. Should i craft Druid, Rogue or Hunter? In your opinion
[2022-12-08 21:16:21] <HellrulesTv> @FenoHS remember the weapon rogue meta?
[2022-12-08 21:16:22] <Niblyg> it really is not
[2022-12-08 21:16:27] <+kwnstantine> it was toxic ..poison hehe
[2022-12-08 21:16:28] <Assertonsin> this hunter deck looks really bad
[2022-12-08 21:16:30] <shelterfx> i take this scuffed dk over how broken DH was on release
[2022-12-08 21:16:32] <Niblyg> you have to release it broken so that people buy it
[2022-12-08 21:16:34] <+byniehs> '' i enjoy both ways '' Feno 2022  gachiBASS
[2022-12-08 21:16:34] <%FenoHS_Official> YEP
[2022-12-08 21:16:38] <shelterfx> Dh was so toxic on realease lmao
[2022-12-08 21:16:44] <%+WildKarrde11> yeah its practice for the future, getting it right the 1st go is important
[2022-12-08 21:16:44] <%ElementZicronium> yeah dh wwas nuts on release
[2022-12-08 21:16:45] <gymmaxxing> @hohlage hunter is cheapest but they're all getting nerfed 100%
[2022-12-08 21:16:48] <skellybr0> but how can they sell the next rotation cards if the current cards are Broken? Kappa they still want to sell this years packs so they didnt make DK or this set too strong, theyll buff it on next set release and the next set will be crazy strong. watch
[2022-12-08 21:16:49] <BrodieTK> Just play Druid and you’ll have fun :)
[2022-12-08 21:16:49] <milayths> @FenoHS u have this hunter version code?

[2022-12-08 21:19:36] <%+AliBlitz> @FenoHS I guess it is somewhat difficult to find the right balance at the start with a whole new class with this much new cards and maybe the tried to play it safe at first. It kinda feels a bit underwhleming compared to the last two expansions.
[2022-12-08 21:19:42] <+Sneakyxxrocket> Everyone was playing ramp druid at the beginning of sunken city
[2022-12-08 21:19:46] <!reqvam> yeah I didn't mind that
[2022-12-08 21:19:46] <smilingsaint> there was palladin and deck of chaos mage meta.  2 decks were 99 percent of the game

[2022-12-08 21:20:01] <%darkseid_omega> wait, what.  Everyone was playing Midrange Hunter a couple expansions ago. The ladder was all hunters before it got nerfed

[2022-12-08 22:22:42] <@%^StreamElements> DH is a strong but one-dimensional deck If you don't play much HS, it seems oppressive Once you learn how to play/build against it, ladder becomes competely free Expect nerfs to Drekky T + Multistrike soon, but honestly I don't think it's needed
