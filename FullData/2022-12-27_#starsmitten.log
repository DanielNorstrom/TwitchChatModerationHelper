[2022-12-27 03:06:53] <EvanWolf> @starsmitten it's because it's a whole block. stairs and slabs are okay
[2022-12-27 03:06:54] <%SonnyDesu> you can open it if its stairs or half slabs abouve it
[2022-12-27 03:06:57] <+seadeaffan> its cause stairs dont count as a solid block

[2022-12-27 03:07:07] <%Mud101kip> The block above the chest cannot be a solid block. Stairs and slabs are not solid blocks so chests can open under them

[2022-12-27 03:10:06] <%Benxtzu> You put 2 slabs in the back which made a block
[2022-12-27 03:10:16] <+DataDal> Maybe use stairs and turn them around to face away?
[2022-12-27 03:10:16] <@%+mrkmattos> janet i will pay you money to set up her audio split
[2022-12-27 03:10:25] <+airick1986> It’s bc the two slabs make a “full block”
[2022-12-27 03:10:28] <%Mud101kip> Combining two slabs in one block space turns that block space into a solid block
[2022-12-27 03:10:29] <%S3rp3nt_007> slabs dont

[2022-12-27 08:55:19] <Samuruan> Yeah healing parse not accurate
[2022-12-27 08:55:20] <%Kindofwacky> if someone knows how to read logs they can tell when people are just parses and that looks worse to better players
[2022-12-27 08:55:26] <+dugup> would need other healers to int to get the giga parses
[2022-12-27 08:55:27] <%+purewinds> healing parsing can be pretty degen

[2022-12-27 11:20:41] <%totallynotahealermain> you also have to use nature's swiftness asap after every convoke or else it's out of sync

[2022-12-27 11:21:42] <%totallynotahealermain> it's more important to get to 2 stacks of reforestation and sit on it for a ramp than use swiftmend as a spot heal, in my experience

[2022-12-27 13:34:42] <Knighten> @starsmitten maybe buff because of raids? think the top mythic guilds only ran evokers, disc priests and holy paladins
