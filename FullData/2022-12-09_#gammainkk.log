[2022-12-09 13:48:34] <%akofeja> the complaints about $20 skins will be no more with a femboy character. the only complaint will be that there isnt enough skins

[2022-12-09 13:48:53] <SynthOasis> Per definition a twink has the title of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and that‚Äôs what gets me personally, can be interpreted in bad ways ya know. Power to ya tho

[2022-12-09 13:53:01] <%akofeja> i saw a video that said that abex only started having a downfall when it announced a trans character, and i think thats just bigotry lmao, im sure people would do the same with ow2, but if they do it before their game dies than people cant really blame it on that. who knows though, its not like i have a degree for marketing, sales, and business management, oh wait, i do, i might know what im saying, im also very tired

[2022-12-09 13:54:44] <SynthOasis> I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs from the lack of content. It‚Äôs great that they added stuff for lore and more depth but there are bigger issues that haven‚Äôt been dealt with. And their response is year 3 of the same gamemodes with no change since the first year. @akofeja

[2022-12-09 13:56:13] <SynthOasis> I do agree with you tho I know some people felt a type of way about that. Me personally I could care less make the community happy and all is good on all sides but those ‚Äúmajor‚Äù issues have been prevalent for a while now which is why I‚Äôve taken a break myself @akofeja
