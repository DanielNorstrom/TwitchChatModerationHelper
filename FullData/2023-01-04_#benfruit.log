[2023-01-04 08:46:46] <%Dirt_McGirrt> see a lot of the world has what's called a "water table", ben

[2023-01-04 08:47:18] <@%BoneBreaker747> water drains into the sump then you have a pump that takes it outside
[2023-01-04 08:47:23] <thehugo09> it happens when the line that leads out of the house is higher than the plumbing in the basement. need a pump to pump it out
[2023-01-04 08:47:32] <thehugo09> once it goes out your basement can flood
[2023-01-04 08:47:40] <%Dirt_McGirrt> yea people with basements and shit have to have them most places unless the sewer is lower than the basement like in some cities
[2023-01-04 08:47:58] <%SneakyFokker> Sump is usually a low point in a building and the pump sits there and pumps water out. Boats have them also in the bottom of the boat.
[2023-01-04 08:48:09] <+Scarce22> You can use a sump for a lot of things, Like if you need to build a snow shelter you build a sump so the water goes down there and keeps you warmer up top
[2023-01-04 08:48:12] VIEWERS: 713

[2023-01-04 10:39:11] <+ice9tom> In Canada they freeze cider, as the water freezes they knock off the frozen water and add more cider. This increases the alcohol content of the cider.
