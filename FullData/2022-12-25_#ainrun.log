[2022-12-25 09:49:03] <@%EnSevenTea> @jdredd001 just an overlay

[2022-12-25 10:44:47] <%kuiliskgirlfriend> Goofy Ahh is an AAVE phrase and slang term meaning ‚Äúgoofy ass‚Äù used to label content as goofy or silly. The related phrase ‚Äúgoofy ahh sound‚Äù became popular on TikTok in early 2022 as a spam comment, often used on videos where the original sound contains goofy sound effects associated with the 21st Century Humor, including cartoon sound effects and indiscernible noises.

[2022-12-25 12:16:58] <Arthemesia94> Once you get him stuck in the corner, unlock the camera. I think the moment he rolls your character moves slightly towards that direction and creates enough space for him to get away. Just a theory

[2022-12-25 15:52:09] <TheGloriousRage> @IGotSacked she 100% IS. But it's only 1 or 2 attacks she has that leave enough time for a single kick. So it's would take sooooo long

[2022-12-25 15:53:01] <%IGotSacked> 1 hit taken from malenia is a 20 minute time loss it feels like
[2022-12-25 15:53:05] <7daysurvivor> if Malenia gets an attack in, prolly 30 kicks is wasted

[2022-12-25 16:05:54] <%GoesOnGhost> i don't know. malenia is at least 1 boss
[2022-12-25 16:06:04] <Microcosm095> @Microcosm095 i'm doing good too and merry christmas dude LUL
[2022-12-25 16:06:07] <!%1Fek> right Hmm
[2022-12-25 16:06:10] <@%ArhamSAA> !title ELDEN BEAST DOWN | GODSKIN DUO TIME | !KICKONLY
[2022-12-25 16:06:10] <@%^Nightbot> @ArhamSAA -> The stream title has been updated to: ELDEN BEAST DOWN | GODSKIN DUO TIME | !KICKONLY
[2022-12-25 16:06:11] <%IGotSacked> malenia can have triple the hp bar of duo
[2022-12-25 16:06:22] <%IGotSacked> with half the opening
[2022-12-25 16:06:29] <balkonas1> Skill issue :(
[2022-12-25 16:06:29] <%lkingfrost> 90% left, YOU GOT THIS
[2022-12-25 16:06:42] <%AzaZ_ow> and the skip you do with her weapon is actually hard LULW
[2022-12-25 16:06:48] <Nifran> one boss but self healing LUL
[2022-12-25 16:06:58] <Cheznoid> i think its one missed roll and she just gets all her HP back that took you 40 minutes to take off
[2022-12-25 16:07:02] <+m4dvillain_m> Rotussy best opening
[2022-12-25 16:07:05] <%+sufficientpanic> Ain is great at Malenia, not too sure about the branches leading up to her tho distT
[2022-12-25 16:07:05] <%AzaZ_ow> the glitchless godskin skip
[2022-12-25 16:07:21] <@%ArhamSAA> he said he got it 2/100 times
[2022-12-25 16:07:32] <!%oppai_o> 3/100 arham
[2022-12-25 16:07:33] <%IGotSacked> even if he is great at malenia every hit taken removes 20-30 minutes of progress
[2022-12-25 16:07:34] <!%oppai_o> Weird
[2022-12-25 16:07:35] <%AzaZ_ow> I was testing it and didn't get it once LULW
[2022-12-25 16:07:35] <%kuiliskgirlfriend> godskin duo is an optional boss?

[2022-12-25 16:10:27] <zrattyL> what is your talismans?
[2022-12-25 16:10:42] <%AzaZ_ow> no roll strats will help you so much with this fight
[2022-12-25 16:10:43] <%sad_goblin_96> the rolling move is so scary
[2022-12-25 16:10:44] <zrattyL> oh ye ideal ones
[2022-12-25 16:10:45] <@%ArhamSAA> I'd take the roll over whatever the fuck Apostle does in phse 2
[2022-12-25 16:10:57] <%KingAmanj> So duo is not doable?
[2022-12-25 16:10:57] <!%oppai_o> phse
[2022-12-25 16:11:02] <zrattyL> maybe try sleeping and doing buffs at phase two?

[2022-12-25 16:11:20] <%AzaZ_ow> well not rolling means more time kicking OKAY
[2022-12-25 16:11:20] <%Sheeerforce> apostle phase 2 is reasonably safe it just takes 5 minutes per kick
[2022-12-25 16:11:23] <@%ArhamSAA> he means no roll fights champion respite guys do
