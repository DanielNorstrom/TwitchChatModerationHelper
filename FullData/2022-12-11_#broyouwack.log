She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon‚Äôs keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love‚Äôs first kiss.

[2022-12-11 02:51:44] <Queen_Charisma> I mean like you created space and pushed the enemies off the point several times. Don‚Äôt really need to be on in mic, it‚Äôs common since to move to point when that happens
