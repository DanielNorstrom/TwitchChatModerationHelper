[2023-01-04 13:10:59] <%jorenrenders> dubravka
[2023-01-04 13:11:05] <!%$Krossnes> And I think Henderson is done with them. He wanted gone I think and they didn't wanted to sell
[2023-01-04 13:11:07] <aidan_frfr> As a United fan martial isn‚Äôt doing it
[2023-01-04 13:11:29] <wrightyy1x> I rate Henderson highly as a keeper
[2023-01-04 13:11:29] <Williamzs0> Liverpool desperately need a midfielder

[2023-01-04 13:11:58] <+Th1sSecretN1nj4> I'd like Henderson to stay at Forest.
[2023-01-04 13:11:58] <+beniel90> United should get Costa for gk

[2023-01-04 13:12:11] <+NaikNikhil> Henderson wanted gametime. He is not done with United yet. But he wants to be no. 1. Depends on DDG signing an extension
[2023-01-04 13:12:12] <+hoganius> it looks so much deeper than just a midfielder
[2023-01-04 13:12:21] <%+HarryBCFC1875> I had bad back pain when I had a kidney stone
