[2022-12-19 13:50:19] <@%+Invalidm_> imagine having to pay to test waffles server OMEGALUL
[2022-12-19 13:50:51] <@%ninopanda> that was one of the many struggles i was having ysterday
[2022-12-19 13:51:30] <danilul9> 8.5 dollar ooof
[2022-12-19 13:52:20] <@%+Invalidm_> I figured y'all would have issues with patreon, its always funky with connecting accounts
[2022-12-19 13:52:54] <@%+Invalidm_> @danilul9 that conversion rate is just great huh
[2022-12-19 13:53:10] <@%ninopanda> nope it was how i was configing the API key
[2022-12-19 13:53:23] <danilul9> @Invalidm_ xd
[2022-12-19 13:53:41] <@%ninopanda> in the documentation it says to type it in as "TOKEN: API key"  in reality its just <api key>
[2022-12-19 13:54:14] <@%+Invalidm_> nice
[2022-12-19 13:54:40] <@%+Invalidm_> was it an outdated layout you were following?
[2022-12-19 13:54:46] <@%+Invalidm_> or was it something else?
[2022-12-19 13:54:47] <@%ninopanda> yup
[2022-12-19 13:55:06] <@%ninopanda> i contacted the dev and he sent me a video
[2022-12-19 13:55:17] <@%ninopanda> watched the video and facepalmed
[2022-12-19 13:55:20] <@%+Invalidm_> you should let them know its outdated OMEGALUL
[2022-12-19 13:55:25] <@%ninopanda> i did
[2022-12-19 13:55:28] <@%+Invalidm_> oh ok
[2022-12-19 13:55:30] <@%ninopanda> he was going to look into it
[2022-12-19 13:55:42] <@%+Invalidm_> hope they update it
[2022-12-19 13:56:01] <@%+Invalidm_> cause that saves everyone in the future a trip into the unkown
[2022-12-19 13:56:39] <@%ninopanda> but i gotta admit,  this mod should be updated!!! it works so well

[2022-12-19 15:25:22] <@%ninopanda> oh I was an idiot and couldnt get McLink to work. all due to the way the documentation is written

[2022-12-19 15:27:41] <%imTymp> it is tempting
[2022-12-19 15:27:43] <@%$Apparentthreat> ninopanda When I was making the infographic this time the mclink site said 1.19.2 was supported. I couldn't even get connected so I had to use 1.18.2. I referenced 1.18.2 in the pic
[2022-12-19 15:28:11] <@%$Apparentthreat> and oh boy I tried launching 1.12 with the current launcher and it DID NOT like that one bit
[2022-12-19 15:28:19] <@%$Apparentthreat> the graphics were sooooo fucked up
[2022-12-19 15:28:20] <@%ninopanda> that is fine.
[2022-12-19 15:28:22] <@%ninopanda> HAHA
[2022-12-19 15:29:16] <@%$Apparentthreat> and for some reason the launcher was crashing my computer. happened twice. I updated java and it seemed fine after that but I'm not so sure that was the problem.
[2022-12-19 15:29:39] <@%ninopanda> that is wierd

[2022-12-19 16:48:17] <%+DecoyOcelot> idk if they fixed it but before all you had to do was just connect an ender redstone conduit to it and it would go bannanas
[2022-12-19 16:48:22] <+primo_qwe> @germanmikrowave its just sand that grows sugarcane real fast
[2022-12-19 16:48:32] <Yakobro> @stormblaz you need a pretty good amount to get started, then a little later for actual ore byproducts for rarer minerals
[2022-12-19 16:48:34] <ThuhMonty> I have no idea of what’s going on but I’m intrigued

[2022-12-19 16:51:54] <officialhunterx> in gtnh they do
[2022-12-19 16:52:03] <+primo_qwe> i think there is axes that can insta chop trees that you can craft i dont remember which one though
[2022-12-19 16:52:06] <+stormblaz> ahhhh makes sense
[2022-12-19 16:52:12] <OddsTV> chest can have some decent stuff and enchanted gear. plus you turn the buildings into makeshift factories
[2022-12-19 16:52:24] <%Venxuri> oh i was sure that was the rubber tree :(
[2022-12-19 16:52:27] <%CiVR> 🐀
[2022-12-19 16:52:28] <Reimzu> you can get rubber trees with coins aswell
[2022-12-19 16:52:29] <$JonathanLivingstonSeagull> is curseforge the best for playing mods? i remember technic launcher used to be good
[2022-12-19 16:52:29] <Stormflare> are all these buildings come with the modpack or did they build all this already?
[2022-12-19 16:52:30] <%+Gh3ttoboy> @stormblaz have you played omnifactory modpack its based of that but doesnt have the pollution system
[2022-12-19 16:52:30] <%+mrtraxx> make shears and use tree leaves to make rubber
[2022-12-19 16:52:33] <davethulhu> rubber tree should have a spike of leaf blocks at the top
[2022-12-19 16:52:36] <@%ninopanda> @CiVR hey buddy
[2022-12-19 16:52:48] <Aeliel_> also you can recycle some of the city blocks for your own use
[2022-12-19 16:52:48] <%+ohbi78> rubber trees are cheap in coins for 64 i think
[2022-12-19 16:52:49] <OddsTV> @Stormflare its a biome that comes iwth the modpack
[2022-12-19 16:52:51] <officialhunterx> you can make sapplings with coins
[2022-12-19 16:53:02] <Stormflare> @OddsTV thanks
[2022-12-19 16:53:05] <%Zapper_777> do you use cacti for fluid duct?
[2022-12-19 16:53:10] <calebhub514> I remember in the past rubber trees always rendered fancy leaves, so you could turn graphics on fast to easily find them.

[2022-12-19 21:40:52] <LambdaRail> "quirky"
[2022-12-19 21:40:54] <+b0ltz12> I think 1 boiler, makes enough steam to power 3 dynamos if its default
[2022-12-19 21:40:58] <Dantesaur> I'm not like other dynamos
[2022-12-19 21:41:01] <%+ohbi78> its a 1 steam generator to 2 steam consumers ratio
[2022-12-19 21:41:11] <drsnaki96> also water generator can auto output water
[2022-12-19 21:41:11] <%+lvyEartman> the pressurised conduit was for the steam i guess

[2022-12-19 21:42:26] <%+ohbi78> they have different augments in
[2022-12-19 21:42:34] <%bobolpwnz> they have different augments installed
[2022-12-19 21:42:34] <Pwsed> The augment is what changes it to make/use steam
[2022-12-19 21:42:34] <%Venxuri> they are the same thing, but have auguments inside them
[2022-12-19 21:42:38] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle is that an upgrade for the steam dynamo on bar last slot?

[2022-12-19 21:43:31] <+b0ltz12> i think the power generation throttles when power is full
[2022-12-19 21:43:35] <%Zapper_777> the cable is latent to take power

[2022-12-19 21:44:09] <%Venxuri> for GT there are lossy cables and lossless cables, right now you are using one that loses power, idk if that was your question tho

[2022-12-19 22:40:18] <officialhunterx> now
[2022-12-19 22:40:23] <officialhunterx> you have conduits
[2022-12-19 22:40:24] <Myekos> DX_Plates it's always been expensive, just varying degrees.  can't remember if it was 100k or 250k when I did it
[2022-12-19 22:40:26] <%DrHax_> are bonsais in this and already usable for infinite wood?
[2022-12-19 22:40:32] <nellydocs> @Giantwaffle u only need 1 conduit and 1 chest to automate it

[2022-12-19 22:41:56] <%maimvice13> 1 proble; whit grechtech and enderio is that the conduits fille the 2 slots even it is to different items so you need to filter it properly
[2022-12-19 22:42:16] <%Dagmoo> or you could keep playing more Kappa
[2022-12-19 22:42:26] <%$TheDeviate> I hope the EnderIO rewrite isn't pushed back further once 1.20 comes out. If it does, then so be it, but I'm just so ready to have it back.

[2022-12-19 22:43:22] <officialhunterx> maybe because its getting more and more difficult to code it
[2022-12-19 22:43:44] <%$TheDeviate> It was originally slated for 1.18, but 1.19 came out so quickly that they just decided to skip 1.18 entirely.

[2022-12-19 22:43:54] <%maimvice13> @Gh3ttoboy no duct of thermal but you have a filter for keeping exact items in the maxhine but it is costly
[2022-12-19 22:44:10] <%Zenimer> So to keep up u could just stay playing all night too.  I don’t think chat would complain. waffleYes
[2022-12-19 22:44:18] <%+Gh3ttoboy> @maimvice13 the advanced filters from EnderIO right
[2022-12-19 22:44:26] <splix661> to automate the PBF i use a tiny pile of carbon dust in the bottom input side to block it from putting more then 1 stack of coal in SeemsGood
[2022-12-19 22:44:39] <Wetware> What's the autocrafting like in this pack?
[2022-12-19 22:44:53] <%maimvice13> @Gh3ttoboy i think i don't have the game open at the moment

[2022-12-19 23:52:23] <OddsTV> vibrant alloy isnt too bad once you have the EBF
[2022-12-19 23:52:25] <%+DecoyOcelot> you need at least MV to make numis iirc
[2022-12-19 23:52:31] <%+DecoyOcelot> maybe HV
[2022-12-19 23:52:31] <%Venxuri> it needs nitrogen? damn

[2022-12-19 23:52:53] <%ReassembledWasTaken> EBF is needed first
[2022-12-19 23:52:58] <%+DecoyOcelot> I think you need to double MV CEU a Blast Furnace to make Vibrant, but that does it
[2022-12-19 23:53:08] <officialhunterx> wait till you make the ebf it needs maintance
[2022-12-19 23:53:10] <OddsTV> EBF can run off LV, just needs a dedicated power source.
[2022-12-19 23:53:14] <AmoArman> is there like an endgame to this modpack? or just keep expanding?
[2022-12-19 23:53:15] <Konhacas> Why not make the quantity key for the drawers, so it displays the number of items? @Giantwaffle
