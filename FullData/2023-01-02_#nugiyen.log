[2023-01-02 15:50:47] <+SirSabza> a lot of youtubers just use a sound, they play a sound with a high pitch that you can't hear with human ears and the editor can see in the playback with sound recognition thats what the Sidemen do anyway
[2023-01-02 15:51:12] <@%Andrew756> poor dogs
[2023-01-02 15:51:13] <+SirSabza> you can just map that high pitch to your stream deck#
[2023-01-02 15:51:39] <@%+DerangedM8> just get your mods to place markers 4Head
[2023-01-02 15:51:57] <ThePhenomMan> what if that goes wrong and our ears starts to bleed? PeepoSHAKE
[2023-01-02 15:52:02] <@%Andrew756> they need to be editors tho
[2023-01-02 15:52:04] <%+MrVonDutchman> that berwick rangers video looks kinda out of place LUL
[2023-01-02 15:52:04] <+SirSabza> i'd imagine some videos wouldn't be from VODs though
[2023-01-02 15:52:14] <+SirSabza> so mods can't really marker those
[2023-01-02 15:52:20] <@%+DerangedM8> @Andrew756 you can give specific roles the function

[2023-01-02 15:53:21] <+SirSabza> websites these days are pretty redundant unless you're using it for networking or charity/merch
[2023-01-02 15:53:28] <@%Andrew756> will there be summoner guides

[2023-01-02 15:54:27] <+SirSabza> well Cohhcarnage for example his website advertises people in his stream team and helps pay his mods, so he uses it for networking too

[2023-01-02 15:54:35] <%+EmVe> I do believe also that it can bring more "seriousness" in your brand
[2023-01-02 15:54:44] <+Benyo_DE> a nugi coffee mug would be so great
[2023-01-02 15:54:59] <rizox> its like a business card i guess

[2023-01-02 15:55:11] <+SirSabza> just dont embed your stream lmao
[2023-01-02 15:55:14] <chlebiksmaslem> the reason you want a website is that you're not relying on social media platforms for people to find you, what if you get banned or twitch explodes, what if Elon buys twitch and runs it into the ground
[2023-01-02 15:55:25] <%+EmVe> Of course your main interaction will be Twitch, Youtube etc
[2023-01-02 15:55:28] <@%Andrew756> blogs
[2023-01-02 15:55:44] <%+EmVe> but let say for sponsors, it can be a good way to get a TLDR of who is Nugi
