[2023-01-06 06:46:58] <May_Be_AFK> FB has the overshadow and feel of it being attached to your immediate social page.  Nope....
[2023-01-06 06:47:00] <Jimbro1025> if youtube does it right they can easliy take over the streaming and be #1 over twitch

[2023-01-06 06:50:36] <+mattdudethat> its not selling out though its longevity for them or their families to sign
[2023-01-06 06:50:37] <OutkastNZ> Theyre looking after there best interests so what does it matter
[2023-01-06 06:50:38] <nicolmao_> @Its_Derak real
[2023-01-06 06:50:41] <+Its_Derak> They hold the servers I guess
[2023-01-06 06:50:42] <Riot_King11> and the revenue split is ass lol
[2023-01-06 06:50:44] <sangchutwitch> they are providing you the platform to do so
[2023-01-06 06:50:46] <%+StageName> being on twitch isnt selling out at all
[2023-01-06 06:50:46] <+Lazer1216> twitch prime thats about it really
[2023-01-06 06:50:49] <%lil_izy69> I mean they treat most creators like ass
[2023-01-06 06:50:49] <+Silvia240> gives the platform, thats about it
[2023-01-06 06:50:49] <+mishilO> nah no offense twitch brings me to you
[2023-01-06 06:50:56] <jakelewisreal> when lupo was on twitch, id pop in all the time. now i've gotta search him on youtube. its a convenience thing 100%. all our favorite streamers on are on twitch
[2023-01-06 06:50:58] <+MisPlayMac> theyll try to control you but fuck that
[2023-01-06 06:50:59] <atpickle> should be able to stream on all 3 companies at once
[2023-01-06 06:50:59] <Notdingle> they also take half your sub money LUL
[2023-01-06 06:51:01] <%banj0oo> twitch has threw the bag away soooo many times in truth
[2023-01-06 06:51:03] <%fepsil> not really
[2023-01-06 06:51:03] <+Lazer1216> other wise anyone could make a streaming platform
[2023-01-06 06:51:08] <bakedkayke> Amazon web hosting like the best in the business sadly
[2023-01-06 06:51:10] <%+bearryj> LuL you think these companies run on ethics
[2023-01-06 06:51:10] <bigjay35> it more like they are buying in for there future for their family it would be stupid not to take the money
[2023-01-06 06:51:14] <%+Landons_channel> @hutchmf could you please  move your sub alert from the middle of your screen. Can’t see anything most the time
[2023-01-06 06:51:15] <+sofreer> hutchmfHutch
[2023-01-06 06:51:16] <%+PwnzaloT_TV> yeah the sell out stand point is dumb. if you support the streamer then you should be happy for them
[2023-01-06 06:51:18] <+xZeerks> @nicolmao_ Obviously, I meant Kick lol
[2023-01-06 06:51:25] <+Its_Derak> Emmett Shear is literally a meme
[2023-01-06 06:51:26] <@African_Abroadd> @sangchutwitch with severe limitations, but its an eco system they need strimmers and strimmers need it. for now
[2023-01-06 06:51:26] <VoidFogless> They give you a platform but other than that
[2023-01-06 06:51:32] <+Silvia240> @jakelewisreal true, loved watching Lupo but since hes on YT ive basically forgot about him
[2023-01-06 06:51:39] <Artymis01> Never understand people who hate others for financially securing themselves further
[2023-01-06 06:51:42] <+Foo1ysh> twitch operates at a loss doesn't it?
[2023-01-06 06:51:43] <+GregShotGG> twitch still takes an L in terms of $$ somehow too...
[2023-01-06 06:51:44] <+Klutcheyy> Twitch couldn’t care less about anyone, even their biggest streamers like Kai, adin, xqc etc…
[2023-01-06 06:51:44] <+Waffles19SD> hi dad, im very bad at this game getting better. grow nipples
[2023-01-06 06:51:45] <+GregShotGG> makes no sense
[2023-01-06 06:51:46] <C0nkie> Think of twitch as a building if you move down the street I am still coming down to hang
[2023-01-06 06:51:47] <+CafePatron> If Youtube's UI was better and it was easier to navigate I would be on YT way more than Twitch.
[2023-01-06 06:51:47] <%$FrostmagicED> for some people; twitch brings us to you; by that arguement; what do you owe your community before you swap?
[2023-01-06 06:51:49] <Ho1yNess> 60%?!?! is that how it is now?
[2023-01-06 06:51:50] <+p0tato_aiim> it's all business my man! you do you and do what you need to secure your bag brother! @HutchMF
[2023-01-06 06:51:50] <predzz_> Anyone that aint crazy would do what x person did to move platform.
[2023-01-06 06:51:54] <%+StageName> You are just paying paychecks. which is sad
[2023-01-06 06:51:57] <%+RuggedxGhost> tetris still trade for a bitcoin?
[2023-01-06 06:52:00] <+UrzuS3V3N> I love people like Summit, Hutch, etc etc etc. But I would never follow them to Youtube or facebook or whatever platform... the viewing experience is trash. Twitch or nothing for me but I dont get upset over my favourite people leaving for more money
[2023-01-06 06:52:03] <%BLOODRACER96> I'm just saying if I work for a company and let's say I make 100 a day, if the next company offers 200 I'm taking that shit
[2023-01-06 06:52:06] <%kilofragz> LUL
[2023-01-06 06:52:07] <Jizzasterpiece> anyone that says someone is a sell out is a hypocrite. every one of you would take the money simple as that.
[2023-01-06 06:52:08] <%Indurence_> some viewers feel so entitled for some reason
[2023-01-06 06:52:13] <Chewbakkahh> It’s like the PGA players going to LIV, if someone paid me $200m to go I’d do it too, but they got a lot of hate for it
[2023-01-06 06:52:21] <@African_Abroadd> @GregShotGG run the company as a "loss" you get tax breaks in other areas and shit its all about the taxes my dude
[2023-01-06 06:52:22] <BayouBoyz700> black jesus
[2023-01-06 06:52:24] <Towerman11> Twitch is a weird socialist environment

[2023-01-06 06:52:34] <iTrYWH33LZ> I mean a prime example is when Kevin moved to FB. His viewer count is lower then before the move, but it helped all the other boys increase their counts. And now everyone is making a bag.
[2023-01-06 06:52:34] <jakelewisreal> @Silvia240 yep, this is why twitch will forever have a hold on livestreaming content. mixer had a real chance but ruined it with their convoluted sign up and lack of pushing the platform
[2023-01-06 06:52:34] <+theebonemallet> Cant have too many people getting rich enough to sit around and discover we live on a flat, stationary plane and not a globe.
[2023-01-06 06:52:34] <+sbooth99> Didn’t twitch also operate at a massive loss for a long time though

[2023-01-06 06:53:08] <+GregShotGG> amazon dont need twitch for a tax break tho lol @African_Abroadd but it definitely helps in that front

[2023-01-06 06:54:06] <%$FrostmagicED> we DEFINITELY need to get twitch back on the streamers side though LOL

[2023-01-06 10:35:10] <%+akaBlackbeard> Shorter person, lower center of gravity. Deadlifting is a hinge lift. A taller person has to get low enough to hinge properly and therefore can be harder on legs, and if they cant get low enough, their back.

[2023-01-06 12:29:16] <+hyertypin> @Combface i use soap and a wash cloth, i stopped using q tips too.
[2023-01-06 12:29:17] <+getyousome77> so basically you just have to head shot them first and ur chillin
[2023-01-06 12:29:20] <$MrCM> @Combface wiggle a towel into your ear with your index finger. Whatever you can reach, is how far you should go in. Leave the rest
[2023-01-06 12:29:20] <%+wulfy6> When are drops completely over?

[2023-01-06 12:29:39] <+The_St4k3R> But the reason for this is clear, or? I find this wipe it's more difficult to get good ammo. So people can't penetrate armour that good?!
[2023-01-06 12:29:41] <krideloco> have they made head hitboxes bigger or is people just shootin hella good now?? this is the first wipe i feel like im getting legit only head eyes too...

[2023-01-06 12:29:51] <matejlipton_> hydrogen peroxide is also good to clean your ears it melts the ear wax

[2023-01-06 12:32:52] <+vulkan_xviii> face hitboxes should be removed. Helmets should protect the entire head up to the helmet's armor class, or durrability, if the bullet penetrates, you die, if not it tanks the round. Lets try it for a week and see how much more fun the game is.

[2023-01-06 12:34:06] <$MrCM> @Combface along with snot, tear ducts etc. its a literal open cavity into your body. If you dont have ear wax to catch a bunch of shit, you are gonna have a bad day. Just dont let it leak out into your outer ear, thats what you clean
[2023-01-06 12:34:10] <UnKnoWnGER> this is for sure 50% cheaters

[2023-01-06 12:42:18] <+vulkan_xviii> @HeyAntz if thats true, trying out something new, or in this case temporarily returning a feature would detract from neither. People might actually love it. And a good bullet is still going through a helmet, all it stops are people abusing face hitboxes with shit guns and shit ammo. Make helmets take increase durability damage to compensate even. It just dosent hurt anything to try it.

[2023-01-06 12:44:32] <+HeyAntz> @vulkan_xviii You're not understanding the point though. Even if some people love it, you just swing the conversation in the opposite direction. It solves nothing. It's intended for anyone to be able to kill anyone, otherwise you kill the playerbase that hasn't the time to play much because of gear/ammo deficit and you can't buy a lot of things

[2023-01-06 13:01:03] <Bap181> I think one of the reasons is that its hard to dedicate ressources/time to a part of the game that is already working/functional, even if it has weaknesses. I say this as someone working in games, always easier to work on new shit.
[2023-01-06 13:01:07] <%+mattymicg> Ehh almost 12 hours how ya feeling lol
[2023-01-06 13:01:14] <!%Onepeg> @HutchMF you can use milk and food and energy drinks as long as it gives you temp stats too
[2023-01-06 13:01:20] <cancerous_reply> milk = stimulant 🤔
[2023-01-06 13:01:21] <stockynp> @HutchMF doesnt it say woods?
[2023-01-06 13:01:24] <1killersquirrel> I believe also Max Energy counts as a stimulant
[2023-01-06 13:01:25] <DonnieDrums> anyone who hasnt played a standard account has experienced the true pain of this game tbh
[2023-01-06 13:01:27] <%Bailz94> player scavs turn up 2 mins in, bad lighting, dog ass audio, power in dog ass spot, no lighting, bad extracts. worse map imo

[2023-01-06 13:12:23] <+Waffles19SD> do drops roll over once the new day starts or do you have to reload, chat?
[2023-01-06 13:12:29] <cancerous_reply> Ad block is not a long term/widespread solution, platform has to make money, if we had no ads, youd have to pay to watch. At the same time, twitch has way more ad minutes than youtube, so they have to tone it down.
