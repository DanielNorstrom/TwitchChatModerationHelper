[2022-12-20 14:44:42] <%+SonicSlice> Ah that explains why I dont have a beard
[2022-12-20 14:44:49] <Skoplio> Yeah I've noticed guys who are bald are usually more hairy everywhere else. It's a weird topic but it's true
[2022-12-20 14:44:49] <%+Jhazlos> sure you do
[2022-12-20 14:44:55] <$edwardtacohands> read any good books lately?

[2022-12-20 14:45:31] <%+SonicSlice> The only facial hair I can grow is one that makes me look like an elementary school has a restraining order against me
[2022-12-20 14:45:44] <$edwardtacohands> pacing is super important in books. writers take forever sometimes. 100% agree
[2022-12-20 14:45:45] <%+TheTurbs> hell yeah audiobooks

[2022-12-20 14:47:06] <Skoplio> Well Chess IS a sport, so it should count
[2022-12-20 14:47:16] <%+Zane_Red> @pumpkinbumpkin because chat does not deserve her
[2022-12-20 14:47:19] <jack_the_sniper9> Did u watch the new DC movie?

[2022-12-20 14:48:10] <%+Zane_Red> i watched it free too. its fun, if u turn off your brain
[2022-12-20 14:48:13] <kuquishku> you watch Avatar yet?
[2022-12-20 14:48:16] <jack_the_sniper9> Typical DC stuff
[2022-12-20 14:48:22] <%$yungshibe> enough of the superhero movies man
[2022-12-20 14:48:25] <%+Jhazlos> marvel movies lately are kindaaaaaa ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-20 14:48:27] <%$yungshibe> goddamn
[2022-12-20 14:48:39] <%+og_articuno> Is that the movie where they faked the financial info
[2022-12-20 14:48:39] VIEWERS: 204
[2022-12-20 14:48:42] <$adbullet> DC wasted the perfect superman actor
[2022-12-20 14:48:49] <%unfadingdust3> Dc should stick to animated movies and tv shows because movies are too short
[2022-12-20 14:48:51] <+tazmaniandevl69> gonna give black Adam a chance, he's my favorite anti-hero
[2022-12-20 14:48:56] <Skoplio> Speaking of superman, Cavill is working with GW for Warhammer things boys. And they've given him quite a lot of power over the project
[2022-12-20 14:48:59] <$Balrogdk> The flash from the series was way better then the one from dc movies
[2022-12-20 14:49:05] <%+Zane_Red> DC have no idea what they doing...
[2022-12-20 14:49:18] <Darth_Mack92> but where's the statik shock movie?
[2022-12-20 14:49:18] <FYPme> That last Batman was amazing
[2022-12-20 14:49:26] <%+Zane_Red> too much business involved in creative process ruins everything
[2022-12-20 14:49:28] <%unfadingdust3> And it’s fucking depressing because it’s some of the better stories in my opinion
[2022-12-20 14:49:36] <Skoplio> @FYPme Is it? I haven't watched it yet, one of my buddies who is a batman fan didn't like it tho
[2022-12-20 14:49:45] <+Grottis92> so true
[2022-12-20 14:49:46] <$edwardtacohands> dude Ka'sante is so frustrating to play against. any tips when playing against him?
[2022-12-20 14:49:50] <%$yungshibe> really liked the last batman
[2022-12-20 14:49:50] <%+Zane_Red> garbage content, but hey! its making $$$
[2022-12-20 14:50:01] <$adbullet> the best star wars show that no one watched
[2022-12-20 14:50:03] <%$yungshibe> pattinson did good
[2022-12-20 14:50:09] <%+NMitch_Gaming> Casino
[2022-12-20 14:50:10] <FYPme> @zane_red 100% look at all the games that could of been amazing
[2022-12-20 14:50:15] <shininngg> andor is really slow too and it doesnt fit a lot of the audience
[2022-12-20 14:50:22] <Skoplio> Oh no don't mention RoP please
[2022-12-20 14:50:24] <%$yungshibe> im glad i didnt watch it
[2022-12-20 14:50:24] <Skoplio> it still hurts
[2022-12-20 14:50:25] <%$yungshibe> was it that bad?
[2022-12-20 14:50:32] <$Balrogdk> I liked it
[2022-12-20 14:50:33] <%$yungshibe> thats so disappointing
[2022-12-20 14:50:38] <+tazmaniandevl69> what didn't you like about it

[2022-12-20 14:50:40] <+Hutchysan> Damn, @SoloRenektonOnly I didnt release Renekton turned into a buff dude with tonfa's. noice
[2022-12-20 14:50:43] <+cheshire1332> anyone else watching this on mobile?
[2022-12-20 14:50:55] <$edwardtacohands> I know it came out a while ago, but did u see Rogue One? I thought it was a very solid movie.
[2022-12-20 14:50:57] <FYPme> @skoplio imo it was great, I loved that kept it dark and it gives you the vibe of Batman is far from perfect
[2022-12-20 14:50:57] <Skoplio> It's not bad if you're not a fan of the source material, but RoP just fucks with so much established personalities and lore that it's just.... frustrating to watch.
[2022-12-20 14:51:09] <%+Jhazlos> YI GOING BACK IN?
[2022-12-20 14:51:10] <!%$penguino33> Casino?
[2022-12-20 14:51:10] <%+Jhazlos> oh okay
[2022-12-20 14:51:16] <+Hutchysan> realize* lmao
[2022-12-20 14:51:33] <jack_the_sniper9> Ring of power is like ordering the original LOTR online
[2022-12-20 14:51:35] <+Grottis92> did you see house of the dragon?
[2022-12-20 14:51:52] <!%$penguino33> This is a cool looking renekton skin?
[2022-12-20 14:51:53] <theunforgiven_997> are you going to stream the new god of war game?
[2022-12-20 14:51:58] <Skoplio> like, Sauron being bitter because Galadriel rejected him? What? He turned into a dark lord because of his aspect - which was perfection in all things.
[2022-12-20 14:52:00] <%$yungshibe> house of the dragon was great
[2022-12-20 14:52:16] <%$yungshibe> but idk man just hard to trust anything related to GoT now
[2022-12-20 14:52:17] <$Balrogdk> wanda vision was terrible
[2022-12-20 14:52:17] <%+Jhazlos> omg wandavision ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-20 14:52:51] <Skoplio> I dunno I stopped watching marvel 10 years ago
[2022-12-20 14:52:56] <$Balrogdk> true
[2022-12-20 14:52:57] <+Hutchysan> I thought RoP was pretty good, at least the back end of it lol the rest was dialogue all day
[2022-12-20 14:52:59] <+cheshire1332> @solorenektononly or Green Lantern
[2022-12-20 14:53:01] <Skoplio> I just don't like superhero stuff that much
[2022-12-20 14:53:09] <+Danzilla34> Moon knight was good but I’m biased :P
[2022-12-20 14:53:09] <Skoplio> More interested in sci fi, fantasy and horror
[2022-12-20 14:53:22] <%$yungshibe> definitely oversaturated the market with superhero movies over the past decade man
[2022-12-20 14:53:34] <%$yungshibe> we dont need 5 superhero movies and shows a year

[2022-12-20 14:55:10] <Will_Faro> have you watched Loki?
[2022-12-20 14:55:17] <$shad0wth3fall3n> Falcon and Winter soldier is slow but has some of the nicest cinematography out of all of them.

[2022-12-20 14:56:33] <$shad0wth3fall3n> Marvel has trouble writing in a power vacuum. They have difficulties depicting scaling of power and have written themselves into a corner by over powering or under powering characters.

[2022-12-20 15:47:48] <koreaninuk1> @skoplio I do see where you are coming from but thats like saying Yi is hard (which to an extent is true)
[2022-12-20 15:47:51] <%+Calcifer7302> I think Jungle should have that easy play until 100 games played, after that get rid of assistance
[2022-12-20 15:47:57] <Octanis1> @SoloRenektonOnly What I find really upsetting is that because the pet does damage to every single creep, the champions that don't have aoe within their kind have absolutely Z E R O disadvantage in terms of their clear speeds.

[2022-12-20 15:48:50] <Skoplio> @koreaninuk1 As I said, difficulty is not only mechanically related. When you're realistically a champ who can only run at people and has NO movement impairment effects, it's pretty hard to catch many champs. Yes, it's not always stacked against you, but most meta champs are hard on mobility usually
[2022-12-20 15:48:51] <DetectivePEJones> Asol is gonna feel weird without the orbs

[2022-12-20 17:00:06] <%+Jhazlos> yeah I worked a desk job for 10 hours a day. one day of contacts was enough to know it was a bad choice
[2022-12-20 17:00:11] <pre_universe> You can also get photophobia from wearing contacts for too long
[2022-12-20 17:00:16] <paladinlaw> I tried contacts. after an hour felt like I had same in my eyes
[2022-12-20 17:00:18] <c4stylz4525> So I got LASIK a couple years ago and with it I got free touch up for life.. but not goin to lie I’m a little hesitant about it cause that was an uncomfortable procedure! What do you think?

[2022-12-20 17:01:59] <Skoplio> So was the Lasik unpleasant to go through?
[2022-12-20 17:02:06] <+Schnoogens> @NilfgaardianSwordsman ??? Propecia?  does nothing.  I'm less likely to get prostate cancer.  some people CAN have lower libido though.

[2022-12-20 17:58:48] <Jlp8000> @teamplay4victory yeah. many times. Many thought Nasus counters teemo, but I don't believe it. Would you know how to get the upper hand in jungle as well?

[2022-12-20 18:00:01] <%812svo> @the_misanthrope13 unlikely to press it twice before mike presses W. its just useless against rek
[2022-12-20 18:00:08] <CheesyBreakfast> is that the new meta?
[2022-12-20 18:00:08] <+Kazooiielol> Damn Illaoi is playing like a god

[2022-12-20 18:00:13] <Skoplio> is exhaust new adc meta instead of  heal?
[2022-12-20 18:00:15] <%$Kellogsbeast> Gotta run cleanse obviously
[2022-12-20 18:00:21] <Darth_Mack92> @thatladykiller  if you didn't know teemo poison on E doesn't proc liandries burn though
[2022-12-20 18:00:25] <thatladykiller> Exhaust meta smh
[2022-12-20 18:00:39] <$eph3meralGod> that's why I take it.. don't want any ol' bruiser just trying to jump on me
[2022-12-20 18:00:39] <Skoplio> taking cleanse while fighting illaoi cause botlane going exhaust
[2022-12-20 18:00:39] <Skoplio> the pain
[2022-12-20 18:00:43] <thatladykiller> @Darth_Mack92 You get it for his shrroms and q
[2022-12-20 18:00:43] <HoleForASoul> Exhaust has a better chance of saving an ADC's life than Heal does a lot of times.
[2022-12-20 18:00:44] <%+FloridaMan01> i wouldnt say meta but def more common
[2022-12-20 18:00:45] <Darth_Mack92> @thatladykiller  so for lethal tempo build there are better options
[2022-12-20 18:00:48] <PragmaticTactics> @solorenektononly Do you do Yoga?
[2022-12-20 18:00:50] <CyclopsKingOG> I don't blame adc's for taking any advantage they can get. They're life is a flash.
