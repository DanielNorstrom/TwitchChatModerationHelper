[2023-01-02 17:00:38] <%+xemnaskami> Honestly, seeing you play Elden Ring twice at the same time is already impressive, but seeing you read all the messages while you do it is even more impressive!
[2023-01-02 17:00:40] <fjorlin> how do you even keep track of two bosses? is it just muscle memory from seeing stuff in the corner of your eye?

[2023-01-02 17:49:16] <blob_> K3nzz0 I assume it's cuz laws changed. A lot of companies finally get to do some proper online laws against hate speech and platforms like yt need to adapt

[2023-01-02 17:49:26] <&%subex> @K3nzz0 it's for advertising reasons. I'm guessing that advertisers don't want to run ads on videos that are very vulgar. They've arbitrarily decided that profanity within the first 8-15 seconds would make the video "profane"

[2023-01-02 20:30:36] <@%^y0shi_b0t> When you redeem "Get your own AUDIO bot-command" you need to type to Mikkaa privately (on Discord for example) and tell her what audio you want. The audio should not be too annoying and be MAX 5 seconds long. All commands must follow TOS. Ultimately Mikkaa decides if the command will be added/deleted or changed.
