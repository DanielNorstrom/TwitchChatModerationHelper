[2023-01-07 11:09:30] <%fin186> thing is the money is there in football, its better that the players get it rather than suits and owners
[2023-01-07 11:09:45] <%+ReKoill> Footballers should be paid in crypto, the same amount every month, no matter what the crypto is doing

[2023-01-07 11:09:52] <%SGTShotYou> thought it was 40% over 50k ?
[2023-01-07 11:10:02] <%ManSolo> Wage caps are an issue as they have to be unilateral across all leagues. Otherwise players would just move to those leagues
[2023-01-07 11:10:02] <%kleier> wage caps are goated
[2023-01-07 11:10:04] <%thisispreston> All those top sports should be getting a fraction of what they get... football, NFL, NBA
[2023-01-07 11:10:09] <%+jpopey91> imagine if a footballer that earned over 500k a year had to pay a 1% tax each year which is put into the nhs
[2023-01-07 11:10:09] <+waryolol> if they get wage capped it just means the owners of the clubs get to keep more money, doesnt really work

[2023-01-07 11:50:01] <+wee_l_p> are you trying to suggest tarkov is good??
[2023-01-07 11:50:02] <%kleier> there are loads of really good indie/casual games out there but they're clearly just not your thing FrogeNeat
[2023-01-07 11:50:08] <%kleier> yeye

[2023-01-07 11:50:10] <%+ViolentProductionz> I played like 2 wipes ago and haven't played it since 😅
[2023-01-07 11:50:15] <%AkimboRy> It has a steep learning curve, BUT its rewarding once you get going
[2023-01-07 11:50:16] <%kleier> agreed
[2023-01-07 11:50:23] <Blunt_Object> @Spurr1  that is what happens. or break fires up his stream

[2023-01-07 11:53:02] <%Spurr1> no one is buying skins for a game they play 30mins a week, they get you addicted to a game and so value the microtransactions more
[2023-01-07 11:53:05] <+StoneyJames> did you ever play dirty rally @break
[2023-01-07 11:53:06] <GlutenFreeVapes> If you watch streames yo do get the audio visual experience of games, which is something most AAA games put the most effort in anyway, so you're not even missing out a lot
[2023-01-07 11:53:11] <+wee_l_p> @BreaK i dont think gaming culture has changed much, i think that the culture around the games you choose to play is sweaty af, cause some of the biggest games in the world are still single players like elden ring

[2023-01-07 11:54:28] <%+Jay4our> @Tomshepmx GC2 is thier rank. Grand Champ 2 in Rocket League
[2023-01-07 11:54:30] <PsychoMet> Mass consumerism and instant gratification is what reddit gamers getting at. God forbid if you have to put any effort. Wiki gaming and shortcuts to consumer as fast as possible and move to the next thing.

[2023-01-07 11:56:43] <%Josh_93_> @Josh_93_ If you are grinding then yeah i get that, but I can still log on after a few weeks away and be ok for a game or 2 and then I'm back into the swing of it. Break was saying it was a game you can log on and play 30 mins after work and it is a game for that

[2023-01-07 12:25:10] <%Some_Solution> Yeah you can create kind of a layer of water around yourself that you warm up through your body temp. That's why sitting still is so much more bearable
[2023-01-07 12:25:31] <%That_Bastid> it may be dangerous but the benefits are vague and unspecified so its worth it

[2023-01-07 12:53:47] <%Smorty_1> It's a paddling pool
[2023-01-07 12:53:55] <JacksonBrownPants> Cold water increases your blood flow and engages your muscles. Dopamine is also an effect of cold showers because of how it makes you feel awake. Whether it increases testosterone who knows. Simply feeling good will boost your testosterone.

[2023-01-07 12:56:26] <JacksonBrownPants> People get out of bed and try to wake up slowly by sitting down on the sofa and drinking a hot drink. It puts your body back into rest mode and it's why you struggle to fully wake up in the morning
[2023-01-07 12:56:35] <%$ribbelsche23> just try wakeboarding at around 10 degrees. If you drop into the water its so freaking cold that you do your best not to... then the kickers and jumps you force yourself to take add the stress and also the fun, who needs a dedicated ice bath?

[2023-01-07 13:03:38] <%PatientZ> @Ghoulingtonn I used to do things like tthat the winter because I'm part FInnish and it was something we were meant to do. Heat up in the sauna and then either run out and rub down in snow or jump into the water if it wasn't frozen over. It's madness, and I don't miss it :D

[2023-01-07 13:36:31] <%CellTank> @BazHicks The notion that someone who is positive is forcing it says way more about you than it does them.

[2023-01-07 13:45:49] <+MorrisBlud1> i cant get used to the sounds at the mment, really annoing what theyve done to the settings
[2023-01-07 13:46:04] <hitem13> indeed, you should never use digital/virtual surround... stereo is the way to go. But Tarkov is having massiv soundissues so this might streamline the inputs for you.
[2023-01-07 13:46:13] <chartreusejoker> also if you have 5.1 or 7.1 headphones you have to go degrade the quality to enable the 5.1 capabilities in windows. gotta love it
[2023-01-07 13:46:14] <%+Garbodor__> If you have the Logitech G Pro headset, they have a license for DTS:X

[2023-01-07 15:21:18] <%+CosmicGoose_> I mean they can and they do
[2023-01-07 15:21:28] <%DaveNF> it is a work in progress and will never be 'completed' most likely

[2023-01-07 15:25:38] <%SARCASTICJ> One of the best games
