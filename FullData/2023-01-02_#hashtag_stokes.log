[2023-01-02 13:13:39] <+aymuni> If anyone deserves to have a break in an east league it’s cr7. No one said this about beckham, lamps, or anyone
[2023-01-02 13:13:39] <!%+getriggedkid__> lekker who stokes
[2023-01-02 13:13:44] <+aymuni> Easy
[2023-01-02 13:13:45] <ryanb2717> @76ersgoat4 spurs finished boring club
[2023-01-02 13:13:45] <N0RTHGATE> they dont want him
[2023-01-02 13:13:47] <sashawole> I read that he can go to Newcastle if they qualify for champions league bcs the saudi own Newcastle as well..
[2023-01-02 13:13:58] <N0RTHGATE> dont you think he wants to play real
[2023-01-02 13:13:58] <popedcr> Shut yo dumb ass
[2023-01-02 13:13:58] <tja_100> agreed
[2023-01-02 13:13:59] <sashawole> I mean on loan
[2023-01-02 13:14:02] <+bladzf> Yeah but he didn’t get the offers stokes
[2023-01-02 13:14:05] <+dangerousplayer_> what's your skill level?
[2023-01-02 13:14:07] <%+polskamg> @n0rthgate do you think he’d have a break in prison?
[2023-01-02 13:14:09] <juajajjajaj> Plus he’s a rapist

[2023-01-02 13:14:12] <+76ersgoat4> @ryanb2717 they have a lot of injuries. but yeah
[2023-01-02 13:14:19] <%retlawww_> He probably expected to end it at ManU

[2023-01-02 13:14:24] <N0RTHGATE> they dont want himmmm omg

[2023-01-02 13:14:28] <sashawole> I read that he can go to Newcastle  on loan if they qualify for champions league bcs the saudi own Newcastle as well..

[2023-01-02 13:14:35] <hammar711> He waited for real madrid but they never came with an offer
[2023-01-02 13:14:36] <+76ersgoat4> his wages are way too high
[2023-01-02 13:14:37] <+aymuni> I don’t think he wanted to go. He put his son in madrids academy. Why would he go saudi if his sons in Spain
[2023-01-02 13:14:39] <LosBIancos> he wants to start most games
[2023-01-02 13:14:43] <speedxcr7> @sashawole Dont gass me like that

[2023-01-02 13:15:19] <+76ersgoat4> i dont like how the portugal coach benched him

[2023-01-02 13:15:27] <+mancity225> Varane or Tomori
[2023-01-02 13:15:27] <d7365> Who’s better mid Maldini or blue Lucio
[2023-01-02 13:15:35] <+Yelsrow> He would help no club in the CL, he's not good enough for the better teams and the worse teams can't have a liability like him in the team
[2023-01-02 13:15:36] <speedxcr7> But He was man u top scorer last season it was like 4 months ago, he cant go from being the guy to not the guy in 3 months like come one, ten Hag fault
[2023-01-02 13:15:50] <+76ersgoat4> maybe he will spend a year in saudi and then go somewhere else
[2023-01-02 13:15:50] <+faridqj> he also is a free agent in the january window. He prob gonna stay in saudi until summer
[2023-01-02 13:15:51] <+bladzf> That what he wanted can’t get it all
[2023-01-02 13:15:55] <+gooner2011> Total hypocrisy
[2023-01-02 13:15:55] <NjaskNanskFN> he will play Asian Champions League football
[2023-01-02 13:16:01] <redsox09> he Increase viewer AFC champion league, for sure he would not retired ad saudi club
[2023-01-02 13:16:04] <+76ersgoat4> he will stay in saudi for a year and then leave
[2023-01-02 13:16:05] <+aymuni> I don’t think he wanted to go. He put his son in madrids academy. Why would he go saudi if his sons in Spain
[2023-01-02 13:16:11] <d7365> Who’s better mid Maldini or blue Lucio

[2023-01-02 13:16:13] <%+iamleeegend89> I actually think it's sad how it's all ended for ronaldo. he hasn't helped himself the last 6 months though
[2023-01-02 13:16:20] <+mancity225> Varane or Tomori
[2023-01-02 13:16:21] <mexicandrug_dealer> i think he meant saudi champions league Kappa
[2023-01-02 13:16:24] <papaya_coconut86> Jairzinho Mid, Ginola, Mbappé gold or Vinicius red card?
[2023-01-02 13:16:27] <darremen> i think he wanted to be main man of the team but he isn't on t hat level anymore
[2023-01-02 13:16:30] <+dangerousplayer_> maybe messi winning world cup changed his mind
[2023-01-02 13:16:38] <+bolasie29> How is De Bruyne ??

[2023-01-02 13:16:54] <+alphvgam3r> bro manu use to be the best in pl but since sir alex retired manu turned into a old men place for players and thats why ronaldo said all what he said.
[2023-01-02 13:16:54] <redsox09> @papaya_coconut86 jairzinho you can crafted just use 200-300K coin
[2023-01-02 13:16:59] <+bladzf> @iamleeegend89 I mean it’s all this or get laughs at on the bench
[2023-01-02 13:17:02] <+76ersgoat4> he is just a finisher now
[2023-01-02 13:17:03] <%+polskamg> Ronaldo is not even going to start over Aboubakar at Al Nassr 😂
[2023-01-02 13:17:12] <taariq__> okay heres my take, the guy gets all the hate he doesnt deserve. why fight to be "the best" when all the fans do is call him names and make a joke out of him? calling him penaldo and so on. there's nothing more to prove so i think what he did was good and go for the money and secure the wealth for him and his family
[2023-01-02 13:17:12] <@LAMaynard> Yeah said this he’s shoulda just gave himself to us rest of the season imo
[2023-01-02 13:17:16] <%legalcookie_> is that qualiier on saturday at 9am? ResidentSleeper

[2023-01-02 13:18:39] <speedxcr7> Cr7 has never had any problems with any coaches, every coach admires him!!
[2023-01-02 13:18:40] <redsox09> I think with recent what he facing media keep toxic CR, His son dead, Ten Hag don't respect him, yeah he need recovery time, after all he is just human being
[2023-01-02 13:18:41] <+faridqj> @hashtag_stokes i just think its crzy that people are already counting him out after what he did last season

[2023-01-02 13:23:11] <speedxcr7> Messi really scored 4 goals last season with Mbappe and neymar behind still started every game, he still got praised and hated, cr7 is told by ten hag to come on 87 minute vs tottenham, like look at the difference

[2023-01-02 13:25:00] <kamp123> he did nothing for juventus
[2023-01-02 13:25:02] <%+iamleeegend89> the overhead kick for Madrid vs juve was a moment. unreal
[2023-01-02 13:25:06] <hammar711> Ronaldo goes down at the best or second best in history
[2023-01-02 13:25:08] <kamp123> prolly ruined a bit tbh

[2023-01-02 13:25:19] <+KennyyMeister> imo the playstyle of Ronaldo is harder to keep going. but like Messi he is transitioning to a playmaker now and he can keep going for 3+ years imo. Messi can run a game, Ronaldo can't to be fair. thats the main difference @hashtag_stokes
[2023-01-02 13:25:21] <+dangerousplayer_> he need rest mentally

[2023-01-02 13:25:38] <khkhFIFA> its unfair to cr7, he choose to came back instead of joining rival city team and scored 18 goals ; end up people forget what he did in his entire career...
[2023-01-02 13:25:42] <karlitofc> even if he bangs goals for fun in the saudi league its not proving anybody wrong its not a competitive league lets not take the piss
[2023-01-02 13:25:43] <zII_Punisher_IIz> Last season when Ronaldo popped off for united messi had a terrible season and this season they switched roles

[2023-01-02 13:26:00] <+ac3_20> But you can agree how poorly he was managed in the Portugal side? It was shameful, imagine CR7 had a team built around him like Messi who work tirelessly off the ball for him so he can produce the moments..

[2023-01-02 13:27:04] <kbreezy8967_> messi had beef with pochettino but he didnt bash the whole psg for it did he @speedxcr7
[2023-01-02 13:27:04] <!%$beatenbyjoystick> ronaldo fankids still protecting ronaldos behaviour is mindblowing imnioKNEE glad the world saw in wc hes toxic to all dressingrooms
[2023-01-02 13:27:05] <+domele> isnt there a clause for ronaldo to be loaned to newcastle if they get champions league?
[2023-01-02 13:27:07] <HvnchoSJ> saudi better
[2023-01-02 13:27:08] <+SinnedGamer_> MLS is clear

[2023-01-02 13:27:19] <+faridqj> @beatenbyjoystick the fact that u believe that is insane to me
[2023-01-02 13:27:19] <redsox09> MLS = media  saudi = eastern
[2023-01-02 13:27:22] <LosBIancos> al Hilal team basically slapped Argentina in the wc
[2023-01-02 13:27:24] <%+polskamg> Just because I hate Ronaldo, mls is clear
[2023-01-02 13:27:26] <+lfcnathann> ronnie couldnt have gone to the mls for obvious reasons tho
[2023-01-02 13:27:26] <rifz_21> think of how many players are going from there to top 5 leagues nowadays
[2023-01-02 13:27:26] <HvnchoSJ> usa not beating argentina
[2023-01-02 13:27:29] <+76ersgoat4> saudi has some decent players

[2023-01-02 13:27:37] <speedxcr7> @kbreezy8967_ messi didnt Get benched vs Manchester city out of respect and told to come on 87 vs tottenham 🫰
[2023-01-02 13:27:43] <diggydoolans> MLS championship level Saudi league league 2 level
[2023-01-02 13:27:43] <zII_Punisher_IIz> How's Varane? worth the price?
[2023-01-02 13:27:46] <+aymuni> Who
[2023-01-02 13:27:50] <@LAMaynard> Yeah might not be crazy different tbh
[2023-01-02 13:27:55] <+frankdrebin020> Zlatan also
[2023-01-02 13:27:56] <kbreezy8967_> @speedxcr7 messi was getting benched he was getting subbed out
[2023-01-02 13:28:01] <speedxcr7> @kbreezy8967_ nothing called out of respect, Ronaldo is a big game player, ten hag just lying
[2023-01-02 13:28:03] <+KennyyMeister> MLS just poached a bit of finished players while Saudi are now trying to do that. not that big of a difference in 1-2 years I think
[2023-01-02 13:28:06] <siniture> but in few years Saudi will be clear
[2023-01-02 13:28:07] <+shazzyyy12> new varane better than gold vvd?

[2023-01-02 13:28:11] <+faridqj> @beatenbyjoystick not at all. I am a football fan and think messi is the greatest to every touch a football. but a player like ronaldo is not "toxic" to a dressing room or has an ego problem that pulls his team down
[2023-01-02 13:28:12] <%FALSE9lNE> mls has evolved over the years
[2023-01-02 13:28:13] <+mancity225> What’s ur top 5 all time
[2023-01-02 13:28:14] <+thagreatsalameh> It’s much better now a days

[2023-01-02 13:28:15] <jbo_diego_davy> Chinese league and Saudi league similar 💯💯
[2023-01-02 13:28:17] <player2162> gerrard pirlo and lampard were there at the same time
[2023-01-02 13:28:21] <gabrielkendrick> the amount of young brazilins and argentines in MLS ups the level CRAZY amounts

[2023-01-02 13:30:09] <kbreezy8967_> people called him finished
[2023-01-02 13:30:10] <+KennyyMeister> tbf Messi finished 2022 with like 65 G/A that's pretty prime like stats for a 35 year old
[2023-01-02 13:30:10] <+lfcnathann> he wasnt getting benched bar injuries
[2023-01-02 13:30:14] <+76ersgoat4> @aymuni agreed
[2023-01-02 13:30:16] <cornishgirth> I think ronaldos game requires more physical exertion than Messis, makes a difference

[2023-01-02 13:42:42] <+heps92> United would be a good fit

[2023-01-02 13:42:46] <+Jmste> kane has zero creativity behind him
[2023-01-02 13:42:49] <kbreezy8967_> totti was a baller
[2023-01-02 13:42:51] <+Jeffsays55> Vardy's story is inspirational
[2023-01-02 13:42:54] <+FashionRep> Kane is the most meaningless goal scorer the prem has ever seen

[2023-01-02 13:43:09] <+Jmste> @katsukiiib0b yeah both were so good in their prime
[2023-01-02 13:43:11] <shady0003> he bottled when he had the moment tbh
[2023-01-02 13:43:23] <+76ersgoat4> vardy in 2016 was amazing
[2023-01-02 13:43:25] <$monke496> facts vardy clear Kappa
[2023-01-02 13:43:31] <@%kiyan544> the new Fabrizio Romano kurt has told me that Kane is a Bayern player
[2023-01-02 13:43:33] <player2162> kane gonna break the pl goal record
[2023-01-02 13:43:34] <+TheMoog94> I agree, Because Vardy has actually won stuff
[2023-01-02 13:43:37] <redsox09> they said kane penalty ball still didnt land
[2023-01-02 13:43:39] <+FashionRep> Yh vardy actually scored the goals to win something lol
[2023-01-02 13:43:41] <katsukiiib0b> people disrespect kane when he is the best ball playing forward that england had lol
[2023-01-02 13:43:44] <+aymuni> Saw something that all of his goals were for nothing 😂
[2023-01-02 13:43:46] <JackAFC14> Theo Hernandez is the biggest fraud on this game
[2023-01-02 13:43:46] <yo_pieerree> Harry Kane greatest achieve was the Audi cup
[2023-01-02 13:43:46] <+heps92> Yes
[2023-01-02 13:43:48] <katsukiiib0b> man can do everything
[2023-01-02 13:43:50] <daoud2390> no
[2023-01-02 13:43:55] <khkhFIFA> kane should join city he will play even better there, not only scoring + assisting
[2023-01-02 13:43:55] <mb_steefler> I don’t think so  arsenal will win the league
[2023-01-02 13:43:57] <daoud2390> Depends if he helped towards winning
[2023-01-02 13:43:58] <w7y_> Ibra went to MLS and come to ac milan smashing serie A
[2023-01-02 13:44:06] <@LAMaynard> Potentially
[2023-01-02 13:44:07] <!%$beatenbyjoystick> def doesnt change things
[2023-01-02 13:44:07] <+punyay> kdb voted best midfield of all time
[2023-01-02 13:44:07] <daoud2390> He probably wouldn’t have contributed
[2023-01-02 13:44:10] <player2162> kane won the golden boot and the golden ball when we finished 7th thats fucking good
[2023-01-02 13:44:10] <+aaronfut> if me aunty had bollocks, she'd be me uncle
[2023-01-02 13:44:12] <@LAMaynard> Mindsets a thing
[2023-01-02 13:44:13] <+heps92> Kane will be perfect for united
[2023-01-02 13:44:13] <coatseylfc> Anderson better than Gerrard based on this logic
[2023-01-02 13:44:14] <%+DaveTheRed> Yet Vardy has a PL and Kane doesn't. So all the talent and influence a player has are worthless without trophies for the team.
[2023-01-02 13:44:18] <+Jmste> @khkhFIFA bruh they have the best striker in the world, they dont need kane lol
[2023-01-02 13:44:18] <%+papilockarf> Vardy who has a prem, the most underdog story. Scored in like 16 consecutive games- his rise to the top 👀- dismissive stokes.
[2023-01-02 13:44:23] <@LAMaynard> Guy will be walking round like he’s the man
[2023-01-02 13:44:28] <+aymuni> But I thought Messis World Cup and trophies makes him clear from ronaldo
[2023-01-02 13:44:33] <kbreezy8967_> kane shoudl have left to bayern
[2023-01-02 13:44:35] <katsukiiib0b> @papilockarf i will never forget when vardy broke van nisterloys record, that was so hype
[2023-01-02 13:44:41] <%+followthesponge> bench mason plumlee or isiah quickley in fantasy basketball today???
[2023-01-02 13:44:41] <%+brianmcgee99> Maybe he should go to Man U
[2023-01-02 13:44:43] <khkhFIFA> @Jmste I mean before haaland came in
[2023-01-02 13:44:44] <+freestxne> @player2162 Vardy won a golden boot too. As well as a prem and fa cup
[2023-01-02 13:44:46] <McSauce1> Ofcourse trophies matters
[2023-01-02 13:44:48] <+76ersgoat4> vardy is 35 now
[2023-01-02 13:44:51] <ReactSenpai> KDB is nowhere near the top 5 mid of all time let alone the best one lol
[2023-01-02 13:44:58] <@LAMaynard> Oh thought you said kane
[2023-01-02 13:45:00] <+heps92> He’ll always be known for being a very good goalscorer but when he retires he won’t be remembered for much else
[2023-01-02 13:45:00] VIEWERS: 1 469
[2023-01-02 13:45:01] <yo_pieerree> Vardy can actually win trophies
[2023-01-02 13:45:03] <McSauce1> Gerrard choked Lpools only chance of a PL title under him
[2023-01-02 13:45:08] <%+matty_979> The thing would be if Kane played at a better club he would get to play better teams from different leagues
[2023-01-02 13:45:10] <%+Mbytes37> is that varane worth it
[2023-01-02 13:45:10] <%+papilockarf> Yeah player for player, balling ability kane is clear for sure
[2023-01-02 13:45:14] <McSauce1> why wouldnt he choke other placed
[2023-01-02 13:45:18] <shady0003> ultimately you play to win trophies and medals
[2023-01-02 13:45:19] <%Dzoney_> so many bad opinions
[2023-01-02 13:45:20] <player2162> @freestxne kane won 3 and he won a golden ball in the same season where he won a golden boot and when we were 7th
[2023-01-02 13:45:24] <+Jmste> heres a question, do you think kane would score the same amount of goals haaland has at city?
[2023-01-02 13:45:25] <+FashionRep> Kane has never score  an important goal
[2023-01-02 13:45:25] <+keeeny3> When u look at trophies vardy clear
[2023-01-02 13:45:27] <!%$beatenbyjoystick> do we want felix, osihmen or develope our talents? Until summer
[2023-01-02 13:45:28] <%+papilockarf> But legacy, I’m not sure unless Kane starts getting trophies
[2023-01-02 13:45:31] <%+DaveTheRed> Yes
[2023-01-02 13:45:32] <%+zeroiqmummo> is there any chance for kane to leave spurs in january

[2023-01-02 13:45:37] <kbreezy8967_> kdb cant bang with zidane iniesta and modric
[2023-01-02 13:45:44] <player2162> @zeroiqmummo no
[2023-01-02 13:45:44] <%vDillon> Everytime Kane gets a chance to win a trophy he bottles it
[2023-01-02 13:45:49] <%+papilockarf> As silly as it sounds he would be yeah
[2023-01-02 13:45:49] <mb_steefler> City don’t need him
[2023-01-02 13:45:50] <%+zeroiqmummo> sad
[2023-01-02 13:45:51] <Agwarius_th21> why would kane join man city if he aint even starting bc of haaland
[2023-01-02 13:45:54] <+FashionRep> you asking if you win stuff are you a winner lol
[2023-01-02 13:45:56] <+76ersgoat4> do u think haaland can become the goat
[2023-01-02 13:46:01] <%Dzoney_> kane going to city is like kd to warriors no?
[2023-01-02 13:46:04] <+fayekry> i wish i knew
[2023-01-02 13:46:06] <yo_pieerree> He’s only got the Audi cup
[2023-01-02 13:46:07] <%NikTheQuick96> spurs are so finished. conte will walk and so will Kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:07] <%+papilockarf> Not one trophy, but he’d have to be influential and depends on the trophy for sure
[2023-01-02 13:46:08] <katsukiiib0b> @76ersgoat4 no way, can become one of the greatest goal scorers but goat no
[2023-01-02 13:46:08] <+FashionRep> RVP L
[2023-01-02 13:46:13] <yo_pieerree> That’s embarrassing
[2023-01-02 13:46:16] <icy_vuitton> yeah that logic doesn't make sense to me either
[2023-01-02 13:46:19] <+Trigonda> Ryan Bertrand is more decorated than Kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:25] <player2162> kane is literally top 5 prem st
[2023-01-02 13:46:29] <player2162> all time
[2023-01-02 13:46:33] <+76ersgoat4> spurs had no kulu, richarlison or bentancur vs villa
[2023-01-02 13:46:40] <shady0003> depends on the contribution you make to win the trophies
[2023-01-02 13:46:43] <%+papilockarf> But Kane will cement his place forever as Kane will break shearers record
[2023-01-02 13:46:46] <%+DaveTheRed> The fact a trophy winning team picks him for the starting 11 confirms the ability and worthiness for the trophy they'll win
[2023-01-02 13:46:49] <SarcasticHD1111> Sign Kane to a 3 year contract at United
[2023-01-02 13:46:53] <+FashionRep> Arsenal reserve matt smith has more fa cup medals than kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:53] <+Jmste> he'll end up leaving in the summer i reckon

[2023-01-02 13:48:04] <+aymuni> Odegaard??
[2023-01-02 13:48:05] <NjaskNanskFN> Kane won the Audi cup tho
[2023-01-02 13:48:06] <katsukiiib0b> @76ersgoat4 thats true but like if u compare it to other "goats" he just lacks playmaking, insane goal scorer who could easily break sharers record
[2023-01-02 13:48:07] <cycling_greko> On what basis do you say that Conte is a good gaffer??? He is so stubborn on the five at the back and we get smashed every time
[2023-01-02 13:48:09] <Agwarius_th21> liverpool LUL  aint even top 5
[2023-01-02 13:48:11] <N0RTHGATE> maradona - napoli is the only example

[2023-01-02 13:48:40] <%+DaveTheRed> But that's the thing, a trophy is a team achievement, so confirms your status in a great team
[2023-01-02 13:48:51] <shady0003> thats the thing Messi grabbed his opportunity but kane bottled it
[2023-01-02 13:48:55] <@LAMaynard> I think Kane had big opportunity to win england trophies and has bottled it
[2023-01-02 13:48:55] <%+tomseeney> Hazard carried chelsea tbf

[2023-01-02 13:49:01] <+Trigonda> Bale didn't win a trophy at Spurs, went to Madrid and cemented his legacy
[2023-01-02 13:49:09] <%+papilockarf> It applies to liverpool stokes- if you think about it- when they were cooking and won the league and lost the league by 1 point- people are saying this was the best team in history. But how can you say that when city were there too
[2023-01-02 13:49:11] <+luked_ie> @hashtag_stokes will your new teammate be announced before fgs1??
[2023-01-02 13:49:11] <%+papilockarf> It’s sticky
[2023-01-02 13:49:12] <%+brianmcgee99> Being Loyal to Spurs and Englands top goal scorer ever and the Prems top goal scorer ever is an achievement in my books
[2023-01-02 13:49:25] <katsukiiib0b> @Trigonda only season bale didn't won a trophy was the season when he went back to loan hahah
[2023-01-02 13:49:28] <player2162> @brianmcgee99 exactly
[2023-01-02 13:49:30] <%+DaveTheRed> Bale confirmed status in Madrid
[2023-01-02 13:49:36] <+FashionRep> You cant be great and never win anything its just no possible you can be hero i guess
[2023-01-02 13:49:37] <%NikTheQuick96> kane had way better teams with spurs than bale
[2023-01-02 13:49:42] <%+tomseeney> Hazard carried us blue boys

[2023-01-02 13:49:52] <yo_pieerree> Bale first trophieless season since leaving spurs was when he joined spurs on loan

[2023-01-02 13:50:11] <kbreezy8967_> bale proved himself at madrid and got the trophy as well
[2023-01-02 13:50:11] <%+papilockarf> @tomseeney for sure, hazard was our Messi but 2 champions league without him
[2023-01-02 13:50:12] <+luked_ie> @hashtag_stokes will your new teammate be announced before fgs1??

[2023-01-02 13:54:43] <gonssalo_m> Kane is quality and, considering how he plays (and im not even a big fan of his), if he had a propper team/club structure around him, his goals and assists would've led to trophies already. Its all an "if", but he will go down as a top ST at the end of the day
