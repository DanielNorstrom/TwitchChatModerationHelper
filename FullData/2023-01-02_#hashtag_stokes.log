[2023-01-02 12:33:34] <$Ethan10___> We have no1 infront of the back 4 need a dm
[2023-01-02 12:33:38] <gabrielkendrick> feel like Liverpool Newcastle should be the top 4 United need another st to compete
[2023-01-02 12:33:41] <$Ethan10___> Yea he wont play
[2023-01-02 12:33:42] <shady0003> but they still have henderson in midfield :P
[2023-01-02 12:33:44] <DM_XI> Liverpool won lately without being convincing, can't see them continuing to win for long
[2023-01-02 12:33:48] <loya1szn> gakpo might be on the bench
[2023-01-02 12:33:50] <$Ethan10___> First game will be wolves saturday

[2023-01-02 13:13:47] <sashawole> I read that he can go to Newcastle if they qualify for champions league bcs the saudi own Newcastle as well..

[2023-01-02 13:14:35] <hammar711> He waited for real madrid but they never came with an offer
[2023-01-02 13:14:36] <+76ersgoat4> his wages are way too high
[2023-01-02 13:14:37] <+aymuni> I don‚Äôt think he wanted to go. He put his son in madrids academy. Why would he go saudi if his sons in Spain
[2023-01-02 13:14:39] <LosBIancos> he wants to start most games

[2023-01-02 13:15:19] <+76ersgoat4> i dont like how the portugal coach benched him
[2023-01-02 13:15:21] <thierrynikolas> When is the next tourney?
[2023-01-02 13:15:24] <@%kiyan544> I think im done drinking for the year

[2023-01-02 13:15:27] <+mancity225> Varane or Tomori
[2023-01-02 13:15:27] <d7365> Who‚Äôs better mid Maldini or blue Lucio
[2023-01-02 13:15:35] <+Yelsrow> He would help no club in the CL, he's not good enough for the better teams and the worse teams can't have a liability like him in the team
[2023-01-02 13:15:36] <speedxcr7> But He was man u top scorer last season it was like 4 months ago, he cant go from being the guy to not the guy in 3 months like come one, ten Hag fault
[2023-01-02 13:15:50] <+76ersgoat4> maybe he will spend a year in saudi and then go somewhere else
[2023-01-02 13:15:50] <+faridqj> he also is a free agent in the january window. He prob gonna stay in saudi until summer
[2023-01-02 13:15:51] <+bladzf> That what he wanted can‚Äôt get it all
[2023-01-02 13:15:55] <+gooner2011> Total hypocrisy
[2023-01-02 13:15:55] <NjaskNanskFN> he will play Asian Champions League football
[2023-01-02 13:16:01] <redsox09> he Increase viewer AFC champion league, for sure he would not retired ad saudi club
[2023-01-02 13:16:04] <+76ersgoat4> he will stay in saudi for a year and then leave
[2023-01-02 13:16:05] <+aymuni> I don‚Äôt think he wanted to go. He put his son in madrids academy. Why would he go saudi if his sons in Spain

[2023-01-02 13:16:13] <%+iamleeegend89> I actually think it's sad how it's all ended for ronaldo. he hasn't helped himself the last 6 months though
[2023-01-02 13:16:20] <+mancity225> Varane or Tomori
[2023-01-02 13:16:21] <mexicandrug_dealer> i think he meant saudi champions league Kappa
[2023-01-02 13:16:24] <papaya_coconut86> Jairzinho Mid, Ginola, Mbapp√© gold or Vinicius red card?
[2023-01-02 13:16:27] <darremen> i think he wanted to be main man of the team but he isn't on t hat level anymore
[2023-01-02 13:16:30] <+dangerousplayer_> maybe messi winning world cup changed his mind
[2023-01-02 13:16:38] <+bolasie29> How is De Bruyne ??
[2023-01-02 13:16:40] <migszyy> hes staying at madrid

[2023-01-02 13:16:54] <+alphvgam3r> bro manu use to be the best in pl but since sir alex retired manu turned into a old men place for players and thats why ronaldo said all what he said.
[2023-01-02 13:16:54] <redsox09> @papaya_coconut86 jairzinho you can crafted just use 200-300K coin
[2023-01-02 13:16:59] <+bladzf> @iamleeegend89 I mean it‚Äôs all this or get laughs at on the bench
[2023-01-02 13:17:02] <+76ersgoat4> he is just a finisher now
[2023-01-02 13:17:03] <%+polskamg> Ronaldo is not even going to start over Aboubakar at Al Nassr üòÇ
[2023-01-02 13:17:12] <taariq__> okay heres my take, the guy gets all the hate he doesnt deserve. why fight to be "the best" when all the fans do is call him names and make a joke out of him? calling him penaldo and so on. there's nothing more to prove so i think what he did was good and go for the money and secure the wealth for him and his family
[2023-01-02 13:17:12] <@LAMaynard> Yeah said this he‚Äôs shoulda just gave himself to us rest of the season imo
[2023-01-02 13:17:16] <%legalcookie_> is that qualiier on saturday at 9am? ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-02 13:17:16] <+76ersgoat4> cr7 is just a penalty box man now

[2023-01-02 13:18:14] <thierrynikolas> Imagine having CR7 subbing Martial. He could even start a few games now with the busy schedule

[2023-01-02 13:18:24] <2M00N> of course he did
[2023-01-02 13:18:28] <+FashionRep> He must of known no clubs wanted him
[2023-01-02 13:18:29] <+dangerousplayer_> like koeman didn't respect suarez

[2023-01-02 13:18:31] <N0RTHGATE> 50 press photographer on his ass during national anthems capturing him on bench and he turns his back was sad
[2023-01-02 13:18:34] <@LAMaynard> Might be Erik Thirty years
[2023-01-02 13:18:39] <speedxcr7> Cr7 has never had any problems with any coaches, every coach admires him!!
[2023-01-02 13:18:40] <redsox09> I think with recent what he facing media keep toxic CR, His son dead, Ten Hag don't respect him, yeah he need recovery time, after all he is just human being

[2023-01-02 13:25:15] <%sonyman123> @speedxcr7 how speedly u run?
[2023-01-02 13:25:15] <Mortasheen> He had his time
[2023-01-02 13:25:16] <kbreezy8967_> @laGuccideVice ik im talking to someone in chat
[2023-01-02 13:25:16] <$justaskingaq> @hatymz all competitions was messi
[2023-01-02 13:25:19] <+KennyyMeister> imo the playstyle of Ronaldo is harder to keep going. but like Messi he is transitioning to a playmaker now and he can keep going for 3+ years imo. Messi can run a game, Ronaldo can't to be fair. thats the main difference @hashtag_stokes
[2023-01-02 13:25:21] <+dangerousplayer_> he need rest mentally
[2023-01-02 13:25:23] <teecbee_> fuck it, bring thierry henry back
[2023-01-02 13:25:29] <speedxcr7> @kbreezy8967_ he is not getting praised bro
[2023-01-02 13:25:34] <!%+getriggedkid__> @pyropartyyy hi dad
[2023-01-02 13:25:38] <khkhFIFA> its unfair to cr7, he choose to came back instead of joining rival city team and scored 18 goals ; end up people forget what he did in his entire career...
[2023-01-02 13:25:42] <karlitofc> even if he bangs goals for fun in the saudi league its not proving anybody wrong its not a competitive league lets not take the piss
[2023-01-02 13:25:43] <zII_Punisher_IIz> Last season when Ronaldo popped off for united messi had a terrible season and this season they switched roles
[2023-01-02 13:25:43] <elcloaksps> Lads, he‚Äôs 37, everything comes to an Endü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[2023-01-02 13:25:52] <HvnchoSJ> i wouldve retired at wc if i was messi
[2023-01-02 13:25:52] <kbreezy8967_> @speedxcr7 stokes calls him the goat u call him the goat are u not praising him??
[2023-01-02 13:25:54] <+aymuni> ‚ÄúDie a hero or live king enough to become the villain‚Äù
[2023-01-02 13:25:54] <siniture> Ronaldo is top5 all time
[2023-01-02 13:25:57] <+bladzf> Going to Saudi for the money is him accepting it too
[2023-01-02 13:25:57] <@%kiyan544> why are we listening to depressing music
[2023-01-02 13:26:00] <+ac3_20> But you can agree how poorly he was managed in the Portugal side? It was shameful, imagine CR7 had a team built around him like Messi who work tirelessly off the ball for him so he can produce the moments..
[2023-01-02 13:26:00] <pyropartyyy> @getriggedkid__ my fucking goat üêê when you streaming fella

[2023-01-02 13:26:08] <+Surrengar> players like modric, kross,, messi etc dont seem to get older because their best weapon is passing and not scoring goals like ronaldo
[2023-01-02 13:26:16] <%Dzoney_> ronaldo is actually finito

[2023-01-02 13:26:38] <speedxcr7> @kbreezy8967_ messi was bad last year but still got praised

[2023-01-02 13:27:04] <!%$beatenbyjoystick> ronaldo fankids still protecting ronaldos behaviour is mindblowing imnioKNEE glad the world saw in wc hes toxic to all dressingrooms
[2023-01-02 13:27:05] <+domele> isnt there a clause for ronaldo to be loaned to newcastle if they get champions league?
[2023-01-02 13:27:07] <HvnchoSJ> saudi better

[2023-01-02 13:27:19] <redsox09> MLS = media  saudi = eastern
[2023-01-02 13:27:22] <LosBIancos> al Hilal team basically slapped Argentina in the wc

[2023-01-02 13:27:26] <HvnchoSJ> usa not beating argentina
[2023-01-02 13:27:29] <+76ersgoat4> saudi has some decent players

[2023-01-02 13:27:56] <kbreezy8967_> @speedxcr7 messi was getting benched he was getting subbed out
[2023-01-02 13:28:01] <speedxcr7> @kbreezy8967_ nothing called out of respect, Ronaldo is a big game player, ten hag just lying
[2023-01-02 13:28:03] <+KennyyMeister> MLS just poached a bit of finished players while Saudi are now trying to do that. not that big of a difference in 1-2 years I think
[2023-01-02 13:28:06] <siniture> but in few years Saudi will be clear
[2023-01-02 13:28:07] <+shazzyyy12> new varane better than gold vvd?

[2023-01-02 13:28:11] <+faridqj> @beatenbyjoystick not at all. I am a football fan and think messi is the greatest to every touch a football. but a player like ronaldo is not "toxic" to a dressing room or has an ego problem that pulls his team down
[2023-01-02 13:28:12] <%FALSE9lNE> mls has evolved over the years

[2023-01-02 13:44:13] <coatseylfc> Anderson better than Gerrard based on this logic
[2023-01-02 13:44:14] <%+DaveTheRed> Yet Vardy has a PL and Kane doesn't. So all the talent and influence a player has are worthless without trophies for the team.

[2023-01-02 13:44:18] <%+papilockarf> Vardy who has a prem, the most underdog story. Scored in like 16 consecutive games- his rise to the top üëÄ- dismissive stokes.

[2023-01-02 13:45:32] <%+zeroiqmummo> is there any chance for kane to leave spurs in january
[2023-01-02 13:45:32] <+heps92> Yes
[2023-01-02 13:45:35] <yo_pieerree> Yes
[2023-01-02 13:45:36] <+Trigonda> 100%
[2023-01-02 13:45:36] <%+papilockarf> Yes
[2023-01-02 13:45:37] <kbreezy8967_> kdb cant bang with zidane iniesta and modric
[2023-01-02 13:45:44] <player2162> @zeroiqmummo no
[2023-01-02 13:45:44] <%vDillon> Everytime Kane gets a chance to win a trophy he bottles it
[2023-01-02 13:45:49] <%+papilockarf> As silly as it sounds he would be yeah
[2023-01-02 13:45:49] <mb_steefler> City don‚Äôt need him
[2023-01-02 13:45:50] <%+zeroiqmummo> sad
[2023-01-02 13:45:51] <Agwarius_th21> why would kane join man city if he aint even starting bc of haaland
[2023-01-02 13:45:54] <+FashionRep> you asking if you win stuff are you a winner lol
[2023-01-02 13:45:56] <+76ersgoat4> do u think haaland can become the goat
[2023-01-02 13:46:01] <%Dzoney_> kane going to city is like kd to warriors no?
[2023-01-02 13:46:04] <+fayekry> i wish i knew
[2023-01-02 13:46:06] <yo_pieerree> He‚Äôs only got the Audi cup
[2023-01-02 13:46:07] <%NikTheQuick96> spurs are so finished. conte will walk and so will Kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:07] <%+papilockarf> Not one trophy, but he‚Äôd have to be influential and depends on the trophy for sure
[2023-01-02 13:46:08] <katsukiiib0b> @76ersgoat4 no way, can become one of the greatest goal scorers but goat no
[2023-01-02 13:46:08] <+FashionRep> RVP L
[2023-01-02 13:46:13] <yo_pieerree> That‚Äôs embarrassing
[2023-01-02 13:46:16] <icy_vuitton> yeah that logic doesn't make sense to me either
[2023-01-02 13:46:19] <+Trigonda> Ryan Bertrand is more decorated than Kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:25] <player2162> kane is literally top 5 prem st
[2023-01-02 13:46:29] <player2162> all time
[2023-01-02 13:46:33] <+76ersgoat4> spurs had no kulu, richarlison or bentancur vs villa
[2023-01-02 13:46:40] <shady0003> depends on the contribution you make to win the trophies
[2023-01-02 13:46:43] <%+papilockarf> But Kane will cement his place forever as Kane will break shearers record
[2023-01-02 13:46:46] <%+DaveTheRed> The fact a trophy winning team picks him for the starting 11 confirms the ability and worthiness for the trophy they'll win
[2023-01-02 13:46:49] <SarcasticHD1111> Sign Kane to a 3 year contract at United
[2023-01-02 13:46:53] <+FashionRep> Arsenal reserve matt smith has more fa cup medals than kane
[2023-01-02 13:46:53] <+Jmste> he'll end up leaving in the summer i reckon
[2023-01-02 13:46:56] <player2162> @76ersgoat4 richarlison dosent start

[2023-01-02 13:48:05] <NjaskNanskFN> Kane won the Audi cup tho
[2023-01-02 13:48:06] <katsukiiib0b> @76ersgoat4 thats true but like if u compare it to other "goats" he just lacks playmaking, insane goal scorer who could easily break sharers record
[2023-01-02 13:48:07] <cycling_greko> On what basis do you say that Conte is a good gaffer??? He is so stubborn on the five at the back and we get smashed every time
[2023-01-02 13:48:09] <Agwarius_th21> liverpool LUL  aint even top 5
[2023-01-02 13:48:11] <N0RTHGATE> maradona - napoli is the only example

[2023-01-02 13:48:40] <%+DaveTheRed> But that's the thing, a trophy is a team achievement, so confirms your status in a great team
[2023-01-02 13:48:51] <shady0003> thats the thing Messi grabbed his opportunity but kane bottled it
[2023-01-02 13:48:55] <@LAMaynard> I think Kane had big opportunity to win england trophies and has bottled it

[2023-01-02 13:49:01] <+Trigonda> Bale didn't win a trophy at Spurs, went to Madrid and cemented his legacy
[2023-01-02 13:49:09] <%+papilockarf> It applies to liverpool stokes- if you think about it- when they were cooking and won the league and lost the league by 1 point- people are saying this was the best team in history. But how can you say that when city were there too
[2023-01-02 13:49:11] <+luked_ie> @hashtag_stokes will your new teammate be announced before fgs1??
[2023-01-02 13:49:11] <%+papilockarf> It‚Äôs sticky
[2023-01-02 13:49:12] <%+brianmcgee99> Being Loyal to Spurs and Englands top goal scorer ever and the Prems top goal scorer ever is an achievement in my books
[2023-01-02 13:49:25] <katsukiiib0b> @Trigonda only season bale didn't won a trophy was the season when he went back to loan hahah
[2023-01-02 13:49:28] <player2162> @brianmcgee99 exactly
[2023-01-02 13:49:30] <%+DaveTheRed> Bale confirmed status in Madrid
[2023-01-02 13:49:36] <+FashionRep> You cant be great and never win anything its just no possible you can be hero i guess
[2023-01-02 13:49:37] <%NikTheQuick96> kane had way better teams with spurs than bale

[2023-01-02 13:54:42] <%NikTheQuick96> daniel levy
[2023-01-02 13:54:43] <gonssalo_m> Kane is quality and, considering how he plays (and im not even a big fan of his), if he had a propper team/club structure around him, his goals and assists would've led to trophies already. Its all an "if", but he will go down as a top ST at the end of the day
[2023-01-02 13:54:44] <player2162> levy
[2023-01-02 13:54:45] <BradleyFlower2000> is fgs today?if so what time pls

[2023-01-02 13:55:49] <+ty_tavarez> @hashtag_stokes if kane goes bayern they become SERIOUS champs league contenders
[2023-01-02 13:55:54] <%+papilockarf> He will never do that at spurs
[2023-01-02 13:55:56] <%+DaveTheRed> The interview both Kane and Maguire did with Garry Nevile showed their mentality, and neither are winners in any sense

[2023-01-02 13:56:08] <%+papilockarf> He had the chance once, ghosted
[2023-01-02 13:56:12] <shady0003> Last season kane should have forced his way out of Tott when city still wanted him
[2023-01-02 13:56:15] <%+JustKrepto> ginola's finishing still good enough with an engine?
[2023-01-02 13:56:24] <yo_pieerree> Kane has never performed in a final
