[2023-01-05 13:03:19] <+DicksMcChicken> Bird is a british slang term for 'the ladies' i think.
[2023-01-05 13:03:27] <zambo33> there ya go
[2023-01-05 13:03:28] <+DicksMcChicken> Bee makes sense, as a male
[2023-01-05 13:03:33] <%garrymcpower> Buy a copy for his mum
[2023-01-05 13:03:36] <ozzie_ace> Though there are some variations, the story typically involves bees pollinating flowers, symbolizing male fertilization, and the birds laying eggs, which equates to female ovulation.
[2023-01-05 13:03:36] <TheGriff97> @chronical1 pollinate of female and then take it to male plants, i work in horticulture as well as bars

[2023-01-05 13:04:32] <%xjonrcx> bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain parallel to the way a man brings about fertilisation. Female birds laying eggs is a similarly visible and easy-to-explain parallel to female ovulation

[2023-01-05 13:06:06] <%+TimKhanG> Bees and birds do not have the ability to talk in the way that humans do, as they do not have the vocal anatomy or language skills to do so. However, they do communicate with one another using a variety of methods, including body language, sounds, and scents.
