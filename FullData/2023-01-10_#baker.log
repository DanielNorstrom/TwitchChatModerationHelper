[2023-01-10 00:00:44] <%+Niki_xyOn> until the first lobby without heavy dps xD
[2023-01-10 00:00:44] <!%micahlee83> my initials are the same as Major League Gaming KEKW
[2023-01-10 00:01:34] <Munnes> I wonder if Smilegate will add something to get tripods. KR is about to get slayer and it's their first time they get a new class with new tripod system
[2023-01-10 00:01:54] <!%micahlee83> @Munnes we have the amulets
[2023-01-10 00:02:03] <!%micahlee83> gives free lvl tripod
[2023-01-10 00:02:06] <!%micahlee83> 4*
[2023-01-10 00:02:18] <Munnes> @micahlee83 nah I mean getting lvl5 tripods somewhere else other than chaos, like buying them for gold from npc

[2023-01-10 00:02:34] <!%micahlee83> oh, doubt it
[2023-01-10 00:02:54] <Munnes> the supply does not meet demand for newer classes, look at reaper tripod prices and summoner
[2023-01-10 00:03:16] <!%micahlee83> baker

[2023-01-10 00:03:23] <!%micahlee83> it's called making excuses
[2023-01-10 00:03:30] <!%micahlee83> common man
[2023-01-10 00:03:40] <Munnes> especially reaper has been out for a while now, but her tripods are still very expensive
[2023-01-10 00:04:06] <!%micahlee83> i messed up a few times, i trolled (not on purpose) then made excuses

[2023-01-10 00:27:02] <Munnes> @Sasquoth they even got a small qol/buff
[2023-01-10 00:27:10] <Munnes> which is kind of insane
[2023-01-10 00:28:02] <Munnes> arti is also a pretty cheap class, which is not really fair for how much damage it does
[2023-01-10 00:28:14] <Munnes> 1 damage gem is all you really need

[2023-01-10 04:37:31] <xJohnny023> hey havent played this game much, how long will it take me to get to t3? and do i have to play more than 4 alts? i know ppl say the more, the better. but i cant play more
[2023-01-10 04:38:11] <@%+strengthie> @xJohnny023 T3 is pretty quick now and you get a boost for a 2nd t3 as soon as you get there.
[2023-01-10 04:38:48] <@%+strengthie> @xJohnny023 I have a friend who only started a few months ago that's doing this content but only plays 3 chars total so it's pretty doable
[2023-01-10 04:39:05] <xJohnny023> @xJohnny023 yes but later on how the game progresses, do i rly need many alts? i dont want to play anything else except 3-4 alts max
[2023-01-10 04:39:10] VIEWERS: 546
[2023-01-10 04:39:27] <xJohnny023> and how much time it consues to do daily  with all of them @strengthie
[2023-01-10 04:39:45] <@%+strengthie> @xJohnny023 Nah you don't need to, alts are just for rushing chars and for fun if you want to play them.

[2023-01-10 04:43:20] <@%+strengthie> @xJohnny023 Takes about 20mins per day per char but you can do chores every other day if it's too much
[2023-01-10 04:44:16] <Kwadrat_> every 3th  day and u gain 66% of clearing dadily
[2023-01-10 04:44:31] <xJohnny023> @xJohnny023 really? only 20? @strengthie
