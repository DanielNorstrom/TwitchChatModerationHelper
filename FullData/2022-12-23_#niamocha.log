[2022-12-23 08:40:10] <%Elzeha> apex vtuber streams are something else... man the discussions that happen
[2022-12-23 08:40:12] <%Elzeha> are amazing
[2022-12-23 08:40:14] <%blessed_by_agni> i watched apex for 2 years before playing the game , its good to watch
[2022-12-23 08:40:44] <%Elzeha> I think its also important that you like the game and you do like apex so no harm sticking to it
[2022-12-23 08:40:55] <%Peachu91> peachu91love
[2022-12-23 08:40:57] <+yukineb> 4. You're cracked af at Apex
[2022-12-23 08:41:04] <%Elzeha> I had like 1 friend before i came to watch you but now i have a lot more friends to play with so im grateful for that
[2022-12-23 08:41:05] <%Gallowloch> yeah I enjoy your Apex streams
[2022-12-23 08:41:17] <%OmniJerBear> okay Nia, I've been lurking, but I gotta head of to bed to be up super early for work
[2022-12-23 08:41:19] <@%^StreamElements> Follow my Twitter for updates on stream schedules and events! https://twitter.com/Niamocha_ch
[2022-12-23 08:41:20] <%joe_nj> I wonder if that's because you're really good at Apex so certain things you don't need to focus on as much as say Valorent and Warzone because they come 2nd nature in Apex
[2022-12-23 08:41:23] VIEWERS: 84
[2022-12-23 08:41:25] <%OmniJerBear> I hope you get a good rank in apex season!
[2022-12-23 08:41:40] <%joe_nj> Also Valorent is way more intense cause of the 6v6 intense gunplay lol
[2022-12-23 08:42:05] <%Peachu91> ngl i think i am brunt out atm of apex
[2022-12-23 08:42:06] <Pyt_Alisha> actual369Ashwiggle
[2022-12-23 08:42:10] <%blessed_by_agni> lot of ppl felt that
[2022-12-23 08:42:11] <%Peachu91> but i still play it LOL
[2022-12-23 08:42:12] <crossover_xd> i stopped because of that same feeling
[2022-12-23 08:42:14] <%Elzeha> s15 start everyone was tbh hopefully thjey change stuff up next season
[2022-12-23 08:42:17] <%ggsaltch> lmao same...
[2022-12-23 08:42:24] <crossover_xd> nothing is better or different
[2022-12-23 08:42:39] <crossover_xd> last three seasons have been depressing for me
[2022-12-23 08:42:46] <%Lord_Argonar> I love Apex but man, Matchmaking is making me not want to play as much as I used to : (

[2022-12-23 08:42:55] <%SkylosCerberus> oh yea I finished Scarlet tonight so that was cool
[2022-12-23 08:43:00] <%joe_nj> That happened to me with Warzone. I played thousands of Warzone matches and Rebirth matches and they just never improved to keep me and my friends around so now I've moved on to more rpg and backlog games
[2022-12-23 08:43:09] <%yeetyeti9762> i mean i even heard some venting from my number 1 so it's not uncommon but i also watched em for a long time... yay pokemon

[2022-12-23 08:43:31] <+thehorizon2> I would play more Apex if it wasn't 80 something Gigs for console lol
[2022-12-23 08:43:45] <%Elzeha> agreeed

[2022-12-23 08:44:04] <%SkylosCerberus> I've been trying to rotate through some of my games the past months, mostly fortnite and apex
[2022-12-23 08:44:07] <%+Zoretron> yea randoms can be hard but still enjoying it
[2022-12-23 08:44:08] <%blessed_by_agni> apex is good but its also healthy to have other games in rotation

[2022-12-23 08:48:03] <%Elzeha> could also just do a long term server for subs
[2022-12-23 08:48:09] <%Elzeha> something of that sort
[2022-12-23 08:48:09] <%+Rhodanite_> that would be so fun ngl
[2022-12-23 08:48:13] <!%RinRin_Signal> Funny enough i was thinking of getting a server together for well, the server but i was never able to get on it

[2022-12-23 08:48:14] <crossover_xd> are you gonna get hogwarts legacy
[2022-12-23 08:48:15] <%joe_nj> Disney World has really good fireworks if you've never seen them but also they do them every night so if you go often it gets a little stale lol
[2022-12-23 08:48:20] <%SkylosCerberus> ye, I always build a big ol' castle when I start a new thing in minecraft

[2022-12-23 08:51:29] <qtim> that's really silly :/
[2022-12-23 08:51:47] <%Tosmasko> The Medieval Minecraft mod turns the game into an RPG and you can choose your class that have pros and cons.
[2022-12-23 08:51:53] <%Tosmasko> Very interesting
