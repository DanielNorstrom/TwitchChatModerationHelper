[2022-12-09 15:09:49] <%$HappyDotess> Imagine extracting in a steel cart with just small peaks for bounty team riding trough the map
[2022-12-09 15:10:07] <ImJustaKlepto> but you can only do that from the middle of the map
[2022-12-09 15:10:11] <ImJustaKlepto> that's not an exterior extract
[2022-12-09 15:10:12] <%eeriebunny4> maybe only be able to extract when you kill every AI on the map Kappa
[2022-12-09 15:10:24] <Senor_Kraken> ^
[2022-12-09 15:10:26] <boarmuhuili> in warzone for instance you can do a hostage mission that calls in a helicopter and you can choose to join the hostage in that heli... I kinda like sonethong like that
[2022-12-09 15:10:47] <shkandal> @Vombuz The evacuation point should appear after the banishing
[2022-12-09 15:11:13] <+i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s> a very quick and simple solution would be to simply increase the time needed to extract, would make it more of a risk for players who try to just run away

[2022-12-09 16:01:05] <%BotStik> but yeah on paper 50k looks bad, but I imagine it will be slightly better than last event, and there are a lot more rewards this time, so even if it takes the same amount of time looks like you will get more rewards for your time
[2022-12-09 16:01:15] <%BotStik> which is something people won't understand and still complain about

[2022-12-09 16:02:24] <%bongocat_0090> @BotStik yeah i agree i am excited but the long event might make it a grind that is annoying, i managed to do it (with farming) in 10-15 days last time...

[2022-12-09 16:03:41] <%BotStik> @bongocat_0090 yeah I did it in about two weeks playing in the evenings last time, idk the conversation around complaining how long it takes is weird to me, hard to say exactly what is fair and what isnt tbh

[2022-12-09 16:04:53] <%bongocat_0090> @BotStik yeah, hard to say by now, i believe the grind will be easier because the got a lot of backlash for the long event they did last time, like more than 80% of the community is casual

[2022-12-09 16:23:18] <%BotStik> @bongocat_0090 they've sold about 5m copies on Steam, say average price of ‚Ç¨25 since I think it sells a lot more on sale, thats ‚Ç¨125m, console and DLC you would estimate ‚Ç¨220m minimum revenue, but I am sure there are way more factors not accounted for in that

[2022-12-09 16:26:34] <%BotStik> @bongocat_0090 they had a long dev time which included completely changing the game from original build of coop 3rd person shooter, and games cost a lot, so I'd say they are doing okay but definitely not rolling in cash, they also use their own engine which saves a lot of money on licensing

[2022-12-09 16:34:34] <%bongocat_0090> @BotStik yeah if this was made in unity or unreal engine it would run so much better and have better graphics
[2022-12-09 16:34:45] <%bongocat_0090> too late to change now though
[2022-12-09 16:35:12] <%bongocat_0090> even the roblox programming engine runs better
[2022-12-09 16:35:15] <%$Revelasti> I'm definitely looking forward to UE5 games next year
[2022-12-09 16:35:22] <%BotStik> @bongocat_0090 UE5 Hunt Kreygasm but even though their licensing fees are cheapest in the industry, they will stick with Cryengine to save that extra money, which is understandable tbh as long as it still works
[2022-12-09 16:36:03] <%bongocat_0090> @BotStik yeah sadly it impacts the highest possible amount of players because of performance though, consoles are suffering from lag as well
[2022-12-09 16:36:13] <%$Revelasti> I'm actually seriously considering selling my 2 PC's to get a new PC with a 4080

[2022-12-09 16:36:59] <%bongocat_0090> @Revelasti 4080 not worth it... get a 1050 with a celeron Kappa
[2022-12-09 16:37:38] <%$Revelasti> No
[2022-12-09 16:37:39] <%bongocat_0090> it's actually not worth it though, almost no game requires that much performance these days, i wouldn't pay 1000$ extra for 5 more polygons
[2022-12-09 16:38:01] <%$Revelasti> No games might need it right now, but they'll need it soon
[2022-12-09 16:38:13] <%BotStik> @Revelasti I'd recommend a 3080ti or something and future proof the rest of your set up

[2022-12-09 16:39:59] <%$Revelasti> @BotStik I'm not going from a 3070 to a 3080ti, I can just get a 4080 to future proof.
[2022-12-09 16:40:10] <%jnyX2> @BotStik i got my 3070 at launch for MSRP, so happy about that. 30XX serien was nice... but man, wtf are they thinking with the 40XX series?!

[2022-12-09 16:41:50] <%bongocat_0090> @bongocat_0090 depending on your financial situation thats a useless purchase though, for me it'd be way to much but since you have 2 pcs you can also get a 4080 i guess

[2022-12-09 17:33:51] <Ayber_> You need to buy the trait inside a match too, with marks
[2022-12-09 17:34:18] <Ayber_> it's like a reward if you played well

[2022-12-09 17:34:38] <Ayber_> tbh I'm really fine with it. It's not like you can't kill the guy a second time if needed
[2022-12-09 17:34:53] <%Frostelus> listening to footsteps after you die is going to be meta probably
[2022-12-09 17:35:00] <%bongocat_0090> @Ayber_ you have to vow a pledge and get it at a supply point, the marks (if you need them) are obtained by both bosses, looting 1 hunter ( can only gain 1) and by getting 50 event points so i believe it will be balanced, you have to have killed a guy and killed a boss or get events
[2022-12-09 17:35:12] <%bongocat_0090> event points*
[2022-12-09 17:35:22] <L0ne_R4nger> @Ayber_ something like you will acquire it with more than 3 kills or something right?
[2022-12-09 17:35:40] <Ayber_> @Ayber_ Yeah exactly, there is a fair process to obtain the perk
[2022-12-09 17:36:02] <Ayber_> @Ayber_ kills and killing bosses as bongocat said

[2022-12-09 17:36:34] <%bongocat_0090> @Ayber_ you can only get 1 point by looting a hunter, the other 3 can be obtained by bosses(2) and event points

[2022-12-09 17:37:21] <%bongocat_0090> so you have to either kill a boss or loot a player most likely
[2022-12-09 17:37:22] <Ayber_> My feeling about the whole thing is that people are exagerating before it's out just like the beetle, and it's gonna be meh-ish
[2022-12-09 17:37:23] <%bongocat_0090> @Ayber_ yep

[2022-12-09 17:37:51] <Ayber_> Like sure it's cool to have a 2nd chance as a solo, but enemy teams can expect it, and you need to earn the perk
[2022-12-09 17:38:17] <%bongocat_0090> you keep it through matches though as far as i know
