[2023-01-07 21:25:23] <%+frosteeghosty> @0x0byte if you have played ready or not, they do an okay job of simulating suppressor mirage
[2023-01-07 21:25:27] <%XxpireD> even the shitty ammo shreds
[2023-01-07 21:25:27] <Puke_tv> and its size makes you able to switch it out for other guns in the weap slot

[2023-01-07 23:12:13] <%+brockta10> tarkov is a hard game to learn, once you learn some maps it gets easier but never easy lol
[2023-01-07 23:12:19] <Cdub_272> @CrowFlies00 I did the same as you starting factory cause it seemed easy to learn. but nope customs way better and you have a way better chance to extract.
[2023-01-07 23:12:19] <macgrubson> oooooo origami
[2023-01-07 23:12:20] <CrowFlies00> @pineappled1ck I could try that. Over all I'm still learning the controls and other things, like the small details is a game changer in how you perform
