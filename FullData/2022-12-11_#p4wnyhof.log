[2022-12-11 08:30:43] <450gButter> good morning everyone
[2022-12-11 08:31:11] <Mooki_Mo> I have no idea how to play this game or what is happening but it’s always fun to watch u play it. Hope u r doing well @p4wnyhof
[2022-12-11 08:35:37] <Mooki_Mo> Might have to try it I’ve only ever played 1st person shooters
[2022-12-11 08:37:04] <@%+jwalker76> I really need to try this game myself i just keep forgetting to upload it
[2022-12-11 08:37:31] <SundavarFrehor> moin
[2022-12-11 08:37:38] <@%+jwalker76> I would just love to learn it
[2022-12-11 08:38:00] <+AwkwardTurnout> I love how each set changes
[2022-12-11 08:38:21] <@%+jwalker76> i got into underlords its a shame it died
[2022-12-11 08:38:39] <Kombiezombie> Wenn ich mich nicht Irre kommen morgen die Riot games zum Gamepass - also bester "neu" Anfang für neue Spiele würde ich sagen jennyanYeah
[2022-12-11 08:39:29] <%+PloxTheFox> New game pass what?
[2022-12-11 08:39:43] <Kombiezombie> @PloxTheFox Xbox gamepass
[2022-12-11 08:39:49] <%+PloxTheFox> Aaah
[2022-12-11 08:39:59] <@%+jwalker76> oh
[2022-12-11 08:40:14] <+AwkwardTurnout> Getting the pass is always worth
[2022-12-11 08:40:29] <+AwkwardTurnout> It pays for itself with everything you get
[2022-12-11 08:40:30] <+TheBlackLion1312> for me its hard to understand the new set with the new champion augments
[2022-12-11 08:41:14] <@%+jwalker76> !moba
[2022-12-11 08:41:14] <@%^StreamElements> These are the apps P4wnyhof uses while playing TFT. Called Mobalytics: https://mobalytics.gg/ and MetaTFT: https://www.metatft.com/
[2022-12-11 08:41:19] <+TheBlackLion1312> thx
[2022-12-11 08:41:24] <+AwkwardTurnout> After a few games you get used to it. Was weird af for me because it forces you to play a comp around the champion augment
[2022-12-11 08:42:11] <+AwkwardTurnout> Fiddle is broken af lol
[2022-12-11 08:42:28] <+AwkwardTurnout> same with Nunu

[2022-12-11 10:36:17] <%LordOverflow> For Marvel Snap content you would need to have costume for each deck ;)
[2022-12-11 10:37:41] <Sonleo> i had a match where, i got a nasus augment, first augment, someone else got the exact same one, and without really rolling they got a lvl 3 a nasus before stage 3. while i couldnt find a 2nd one. So i pivoted to draven mech. got to 9. zero leona's. half my mecha's level 1. two ppl had two lvl 2 leona's. noone else had any mechs. I got to 9 without getting units level'd. then i came 6th lol.

[2022-12-11 10:41:22] <Sonleo> i think i dig too hard into committing to a comp i like even at the detriment of my placement.
[2022-12-11 10:41:48] <Sonleo> but the times i pivot into completely uncontested comps, i just dont hit those units. As if, they arent there.

[2022-12-11 12:52:44] <Sonleo> for what seems like my 8 th match that ive had unit augment first augment in a row. and whatever ive picked ive never got that unit to lvl 2.
[2022-12-11 12:52:44] <@%^StreamElements> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2022-12-11 12:52:54] <Pomelo_juice> @hilo1124 45 at teir 3
[2022-12-11 12:53:53] <Sonleo> i just came 6th with a lvl 3 sona and ezreal, underground mascot combo. she was doing 800 magic dmg per spell cast. still sitting on a lvl 1 vi, while noone had her.
[2022-12-11 12:54:08] <Pomelo_juice> @Sonleo frontline diff

[2022-12-11 12:56:32] <Crashman207> is Urgot any good this set?
[2022-12-11 12:56:39] <Sonleo> you say that @Pomelo_juice but she had 250 armour and magic resist. just no hp, because i couldnt level 2 an uncontentested unit with over 80 gold in rolls sitting at level 6.
[2022-12-11 12:57:35] <Pomelo_juice> @Sonleo how do you get 250 armor and mr on a 1star unit?
[2022-12-11 12:58:20] <Pomelo_juice> leona is a bonkers unit
[2022-12-11 12:58:53] <Pomelo_juice> leona ult is the delete button
[2022-12-11 12:58:53] <Sonleo> her augment was basically a titans vow on steriods, plus d-claw, brambles and another titans
[2022-12-11 12:58:58] <Sonleo> it stacked together to hit 250
[2022-12-11 12:59:07] <CoqBurne> problem with Leona is if she uses ult on a unit which has low HP
[2022-12-11 12:59:33] <Pomelo_juice> @Sonleo yeah but it had to stack right
[2022-12-11 13:00:21] <Sonleo> it got there, because she wasnt getting hit straight aways. its beside the point anyway. the issue is completely uncontested i couldnt 3 of her.
[2022-12-11 13:00:27] <Pomelo_juice> i think fid hero augments are like bottom tier on tactics.tools
[2022-12-11 13:00:44] <CoqBurne> lol troll game

[2022-12-11 15:23:00] <+MiniMages> knowledge was to much power
[2022-12-11 15:23:05] <%taviandir> did the fans stop again? :D
[2022-12-11 15:24:42] <devraiden31> movies that start like this are usually best movies and those with lion at start now days we get crap movies sadge
[2022-12-11 15:24:43] <@%Sanduckchan> EARTH IS FLAT .. what is this fake stuff 4Head
[2022-12-11 15:24:47] <@%Sanduckchan> and hi everyone <3
[2022-12-11 15:24:48] <%Grim08a> So what is your overall impression of the game?
[2022-12-11 15:25:26] <%Grim08a> Holy shit :D
[2022-12-11 15:26:07] <%Grim08a> I am a bit tempted to try it out. I like having that kind of games around. Spent a massive amount of hours playing different iterations of Civilization :D
[2022-12-11 15:26:21] <%Grim08a> Just to have something that is not online
[2022-12-11 15:27:52] <%Grim08a> Tropico is a pretty fun game also :)
[2022-12-11 15:28:11] <%Grim08a> This kind of reminds me of that with a Jurassic Park theme over it ofc :)
[2022-12-11 15:29:23] <%Grim08a> Oh its Frontier Developments that made the game. Now I became all Elite nostalgic :D
[2022-12-11 15:31:48] <arne8anane> Hi, when do the dinos break out, and gun-doch starts hunting them down with the loadout?

[2022-12-11 15:33:44] <Gaslord90> I think the truck tour can drive through it
[2022-12-11 15:34:42] <%Grim08a> Looks like it can't be inside the dome
[2022-12-11 15:35:04] <+TheM0nk> it can you just need to lower the terrain I guess to create water
[2022-12-11 15:35:07] <%Grim08a> it switched momentarily to saying it was blocked by the aviary dome
[2022-12-11 15:35:28] <+TheM0nk> "requires swallow water"
[2022-12-11 15:35:34] <@%Sanduckchan> shallow ;)
[2022-12-11 15:35:37] <+TheM0nk> same same :D
[2022-12-11 15:35:45] <%+AlinM4A1> lower the terrain i guess
[2022-12-11 15:35:52] <%+AlinM4A1> like a hole
[2022-12-11 15:36:02] <+TheM0nk> yea create a valley
