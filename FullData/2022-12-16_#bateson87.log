[2022-12-16 13:00:52] <%+2leftfeet> half way line goal vs west ham was a bit saucy
[2022-12-16 13:00:52] <%taily2020> thats wats missing in football at the min the passion players use to have compared to nw
[2022-12-16 13:00:53] <%babyslim74> I'm cr7 all the way
[2022-12-16 13:00:58] <+keironpfc20> Exactly bates
[2022-12-16 13:00:59] <!%Pikey_97> messi just naturally gifted tbf
[2022-12-16 13:01:01] <%+GingerNinjaD> can someone explain why Baggio is a huge Baggio or poop
[2022-12-16 13:01:06] <!%Pikey_97> ronaldo trained for his ability
[2022-12-16 13:01:12] <%+mrsquirty76> cr7 ain't as good as Pele was
[2022-12-16 13:01:12] <@%Arberg> Endrick can't wait to see him play in europa.
[2022-12-16 13:01:19] <Duffract> why is he though, he's faded at 34?
[2022-12-16 13:01:20] <!%Pikey_97> messi was simply born to have a ball at his feet
[2022-12-16 13:01:29] <%+mrsquirty76> so why bring him into goat conversation
[2022-12-16 13:01:35] <mxdman_> see ilike ronaldo more but having ball knowledge you have to say messi is better
[2022-12-16 13:01:36] <+keironpfc20> Bates talking facts
[2022-12-16 13:01:39] <+maartenamg88> Why you are in div 2 bro! you are lots better
[2022-12-16 13:01:41] <+NaikNikhil> @ish_08 Chuopo Moting is the best then
[2022-12-16 13:01:43] <@%+TheGr8Bambino90> Cr7 the most accomplished, messi the most complete and  R9 most skilled… imo
[2022-12-16 13:01:49] <!%Pikey_97> who invited pele?
[2022-12-16 13:01:52] <Duffract> ronaldo, people like ibra are still performing better than him and he's like 41
[2022-12-16 13:01:57] <%taily2020> Ronaldo was my goat an sort of still is but he lost that status the second he refused to play an went on his huffs a great player doesn't do that
[2022-12-16 13:01:57] <!%Pikey_97> mr squirty is on one today
[2022-12-16 13:02:05] <ish_08> messi clearly has better natural ability, but Ronaldo has worked his way up with all the criticism everytime in his career messi would have sinked if he faced even half of the criticism ronaldo did
[2022-12-16 13:02:10] <+fedora_the_explorer_69> Who do you think will sign Bellingham?
[2022-12-16 13:02:10] <%+sondreynwa123> So ronaldo is the best athlete and messi is out of this world
[2022-12-16 13:02:10] <$isteaky_> Can I giveaway an Xbox fifa point code in here?
[2022-12-16 13:02:14] <%crzh9> I've never understood how it was even an argument, Messi is so clear
[2022-12-16 13:02:20] <!%Krossnes> Oh no
[2022-12-16 13:02:21] <mattato09> Who here agrees that the GOAT of freekicks is Bobby Carlos
[2022-12-16 13:02:29] <+NaikNikhil> When people bring the clubs players play for into an argument its funny as hell.
[2022-12-16 13:02:30] <ish_08> @ish_08 Yeah better than Rooney for sure
[2022-12-16 13:02:31] <%+mrsquirty76> pikey your clearly too young to remember Pele greatness

[2022-12-16 13:05:12] <Stonecooold12> Why is ginola trending on futbin?
[2022-12-16 13:05:14] <hdsecgre> Mbappe the goat not messi or Ronaldo
[2022-12-16 13:05:16] <LjLavishh> Hard work beats talent when talent dont work hard
[2022-12-16 13:05:22] <mattato09> What goalie has been the best at saving pens? I personaly feel like its either Livakovic or Martinez
[2022-12-16 13:05:28] <+fedora_the_explorer_69> Are the showdowns tonight?
[2022-12-16 13:05:30] <+NaikNikhil> @NaikNikhil Why am I am pissed just cause I said in your opinion Beckham is better than Rooney? I am a United fan and started following United cause of David Beckham
[2022-12-16 13:05:37] <%+mrsquirty76> mbappe not the goat
[2022-12-16 13:05:57] <!%Merk708> It depends which side the ref is on LUL
[2022-12-16 13:06:15] <%+mrsquirty76> too young to be discussed in that bracket
[2022-12-16 13:06:20] <ish_08> @NaikNikhil cool man people have their own opinions I think beckham you think rooney we are both right for ourselves man
[2022-12-16 13:06:21] <!%Pikey_97> hopefully not that brazilian
[2022-12-16 13:06:21] <hereforalaugh06> he's a polish ref apparently
[2022-12-16 13:06:24] <%+iamcroatianeagle> How tall is BuckArmy, even if you make him stand on a stack of textbooks?
[2022-12-16 13:06:35] <kz_8> this agued card feels so much better then his stats are. what's you're thoughts on him mate
[2022-12-16 13:06:45] <hereforalaugh06> he has reffed a France game and an Argentina game
[2022-12-16 13:06:51] <kz_8> aguerd
[2022-12-16 13:06:55] <kyanmurdoch1872> I seen that it’s the same ref as the England France game but I might be wrong
[2022-12-16 13:07:02] <@%+WaynesWorld20_> No sign of AIKStefan in the streams??
[2022-12-16 13:07:03] <ish_08> @NaikNikhil do you dislike Ronaldo as well then like the rest of the united lot?

[2022-12-16 13:07:52] <+NaikNikhil> @NaikNikhil Not really. I genuinely dont dislike any footballer tbh. His departure left a sour note but he will always be a United legend imo
[2022-12-16 13:08:04] <+fedora_the_explorer_69> He was ref for wales v usa
