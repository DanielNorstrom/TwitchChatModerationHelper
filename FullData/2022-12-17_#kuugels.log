[2022-12-17 23:37:25] <%+RobynHoood> Ideally you just get 3x to keep it safe
[2022-12-17 23:37:34] <%+RobynHoood> Cuz 2x u gotta be really quick with onetwo punch + double melee

[2022-12-17 23:39:32] <%+RobynHoood> Yeah you can but it also depends on light level + how fast u are with the follow up melee

[2022-12-17 23:39:46] <%+RobynHoood> So safer with 3x and more consistent

[2022-12-17 23:43:23] <%+RobynHoood> So I think people ignore them and kill things around them and hopefully they just die from the arc explosions that happen
