[2022-12-12 17:01:20] <nox_nyctores> Actually do worry about satellites, start building one ASAP

[2022-12-12 18:09:43] <Sleeper_can> XCOM is a massively popular game with a histroy going back to teh classic  90s times
[2022-12-12 18:09:45] <Tursmo> The new Xcoms are somewhat popular
[2022-12-12 18:09:48] <%+AriaOfValor> been years since i played xcom:EU though, mostly xcom 2
[2022-12-12 18:09:49] <nox_nyctores> Played all modern Xcom and a bit of the original
[2022-12-12 18:09:54] <!%+Stamina_Jay> completed this on the hardest setting
[2022-12-12 18:09:54] <RekkyVidya> I need to! This game's been sitting in my backlog for so long, lol
[2022-12-12 18:09:54] <ughdontmakemeregister> Yeah the original UFO defense is even better in my opinion
[2022-12-12 18:10:04] <+heeropatv2> Love FFT
[2022-12-12 18:10:11] <%GinTamashiVT> Yes! And Ogre Tactics Reborn I heard is super good!
[2022-12-12 18:10:13] <Temporal_Paradox> FFT is a classic
[2022-12-12 18:10:19] <%devriestron> wait you said you were good
[2022-12-12 18:10:23] <Enpofield> Since you got Sniper with squadsight, make sure you don't let your sniper get hit or get killed
[2022-12-12 18:10:24] <Rey_dono> XCOM is really great and there are some fun total conversion mods too

[2022-12-12 18:11:53] <%TalkingObject> A lot of old games suffer from being too brown

[2022-12-12 18:12:49] <AFlatCap> Buying people is illegal now, Olivia.
[2022-12-12 18:12:52] <%+AriaOfValor> @Rey_dono I'm sad that LW2 never got adjusted for War of the Chosen, but it makes sense given the team behind the LW mods were working on their own game
[2022-12-12 18:12:55] <%Grawne> You build facilities you've unlocked in science

[2022-12-12 18:14:28] <!%AirahsELL> engineers and scientists are mission rewards. if you go to the world map you can pick a mission that'll give you more engineers
[2022-12-12 18:14:37] <%GinTamashiVT> So just a heads up, you will get more engineers through missions
[2022-12-12 18:14:41] <%Leon27607> that's selling
[2022-12-12 18:14:42] <%TalkingObject> Sell every alien corpse but one
[2022-12-12 18:15:00] <+heeropatv2> You get staff from missions

[2022-12-12 18:25:07] <%+Dataskvid> Now you have pirate instructions for the bottle instead!!
[2022-12-12 18:25:09] <PigWithoutProtection> you dont dish new cutlery and items before using theme to make sure there arent any chemicals left after manufacture?

[2022-12-12 18:25:27] <!%AirahsELL> theyre usually coated with some chemical preservative so you should wash any new bottle

[2022-12-12 18:26:45] <SunnyDeese> You should clean any clothes or eatware you buy.  Since in the case of clothes they coat it stuff like Formaldehyde and such to protect it from mildew and similar.  And Foodware just gets dirty in factories and such.
[2022-12-12 18:26:45] <%GinTamashiVT> Well, as long as there wasn't a silica packet, I suppose it's all good lol
