[2022-12-21 16:08:37] <DerRasierer> Would you reckon its better to just buy the right colour body armor for a noob in crafting? i've looked into Vorici but it seems sus Hmmge Speaking of T4? and chances and stuff like that, scares me monkaW

[2022-12-21 16:09:28] <%CutterSnake> Yeah but when u want to hit Dot / fire Dot Multi on your explode scepter you burn a looooot of gems XD Ty anyway. Gem Delirium  Orb it is again then.
[2022-12-21 16:09:32] <%SilverkissTwitch> @DerRasierer Vorici is not that hard to farm up to be honest, I also thought it was daunting but I already had like 3 Voricis this league without targeting it
[2022-12-21 16:10:02] <Mislonidas> would you consider a 40%ele sceptre with +1 fire spell skills, 35% burn and a useles prefix worth to multimod?

[2022-12-21 16:21:43] <%CutterSnake> One last question that is not answered on your Wiki (I think). You state that Fire DoT Multi is the way to go for RF. Does that count for Explode as well because I am not sure if the explosions scale with Damage over Time because I think they die with the damage overhead (sry if I just got explosions wrong) Cheers

[2022-12-21 16:33:43] <@%Kilal2> @harmonydestroyer bis is not a great term, brass dome is great defense but pohx has chaos res on his chest that he values highly

[2022-12-21 16:49:25] <ShotGunPhill> elementalist is a currency sink
[2022-12-21 16:49:30] <guidotomazzia> i remember when i see livestreams and the most powerfull build i possibly see are "ancestral warchief"
[2022-12-21 16:49:31] <matrixms2017> lol pheniox is crazy doing a standard version with like 2000 div invesment lol

[2022-12-21 16:50:28] <@%donavanshepard> this fucking belt Jesus Christ https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/zr3hs6/after_65_mirrors_almost_1000_exalts_400_metamods/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
[2022-12-21 16:50:55] <@%ShinnyChicken> IMO if you have mageblood, you can easily do elementalist YEP
[2022-12-21 16:50:56] <DerRasierer> wtf is that disgusting belt
[2022-12-21 16:50:58] <DerRasierer> holy shit
[2022-12-21 16:50:59] <Nejibanana> true, this version of RF is just infinitely approachable
[2022-12-21 16:51:01] <@%ShinnyChicken> Otherwise stick to jugg YEP
[2022-12-21 16:51:01] <@%donavanshepard> right
[2022-12-21 16:51:08] <ShotGunPhill> I did elementalist RF 3 leagues ago it was good but i spent in excess of a mirror for gear to easily kill everything
[2022-12-21 16:51:17] <AbracadAbraxas> or typical "it's pretty cheap and got insane damage, only 100 divines"
[2022-12-21 16:51:17] <@%ShinnyChicken> ok that's pretty much it
[2022-12-21 16:51:19] <matrixms2017> that voice is amazing lol .

[2022-12-21 17:04:29] <%+Rybsson> minion wands have lower values of implicit, lot more usless mods to roll and especially higher tiers have very high int requirement

[2022-12-21 17:23:31] <spooper_trooper> so think about wands, chat: you have attack mods to roll, that compete with your spells mods. Then, for minion wands, you have all sorts of non-damage mods
[2022-12-21 17:23:39] <@%GoGoLoThirty> no idea whats wrong with my twitch, its a turbo slideshow but definitely on my end. Sadge
[2022-12-21 17:23:41] <spain> oh haha
[2022-12-21 17:23:43] <spooper_trooper> so having convoking wands adds 2 pools worth of mods you DON'T want

[2022-12-21 17:35:29] <+Colin__TV> what's the reason for frostblink vs flame dash?
[2022-12-21 17:35:48] <WayneUntamed> Most of this comes down to preference. However there are some advantages to running frost blink. You can instantly break out of Vine Snare & It's fantastic for curse on hit since it has a much larger AoE than flame dash. Just be careful not to level it

[2022-12-21 18:11:29] <lothreg> monster hunter is more arcadey if that makes sense, elden ring is too free, it's pure open world, you can do whatever you want in whatever order and if you don't know what you're doing some orders are worse than others

[2022-12-21 18:13:08] <MintberryCrunchS> @lemoncoolers I disagree about soulsgames/elden ring being similar to poe in the sense that you are expected to know how it works. Id even go as far as to say its the exact opposit. Fromsoft are genious when it comes to let the game itself teach you its mechanics and its hidden ways. Its a very common thing in the souls community to  recommend new players to go in blind and dont watch any sort of guide/spopiler at all ...

[2022-12-21 18:13:59] <@%lemoncoolers> @MintberryCrunchS that was absolutely not my experience at all. I found that Elden Ring assumed the player knew a lot about how souls games worked already. I had to google a lot. The game doesn't teach you a damn thing.

[2022-12-21 19:18:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> honestly jugg is SUCH a sick template for builds. there are so many things you can do on jugg. like i feel like you can play any archetype with jugg. its just rock solid as a base.
[2022-12-21 19:19:01] <%UnboundSouls> its not like its an insane combo, you have to give up amulet and chest slot

[2022-12-21 19:19:45] <DigitalDecaf> yeah because you have to think about the opportunity cost of losing the chest/ammy slot, rather than just the DR you get

[2022-12-21 20:07:45] <+RuinedEpice> Dammit RuneLite get it together
[2022-12-21 20:07:46] <%beweesfordays> am i stupid or did poe trade change how to search for elder helm items? I swear its not listed anymore
[2022-12-21 20:08:14] <Strollein> Damn the 4800 points hideout looks really sick
[2022-12-21 20:08:24] <%+HughMorrisMD> its funny, ignite prolif is generally more valuable to sell a craft, but fire dot multi is what we need
[2022-12-21 20:08:27] <+lamename_twitch> Depends on good/crappy your helm/gloves and other gear is.
[2022-12-21 20:08:31] <+tjohn84> Are you res capped without your Oriath's?  @Pohx
[2022-12-21 20:08:55] <Atrionx> @beweesfordays type elder in the stats filter
[2022-12-21 20:09:02] <Saul_Tee> my helm and gloves both suck and i dont have a ton of currency so i was wondering which to upgrade first :(
[2022-12-21 20:09:07] <@%lemoncoolers> @tjohn84 relying on a flask to res cap yourself is against the law

[2022-12-21 20:18:50] <WilliamGoosen> @WilliamGoosen Will that freeze then prevent us from casting fire trap due to action speed while frozen?
[2022-12-21 20:18:52] <+BigHandsomeMan> @phreakee they just released core supporter packs so could just be influx of users
[2022-12-21 20:19:06] <chadwisethebrave> thanks again
[2022-12-21 20:19:14] <DncDragon> instead of essence crafting the helm can i just do harvest craft in the meantime ?

[2022-12-21 20:23:55] <kiillxx> can elemental overload node work with your build? pob says it does a lot of damage
