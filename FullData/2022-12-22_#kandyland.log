It puts immense pressure on the streamer and the community and none of us (in most cases) are equipped to handle such a delicate state of mind.. Please seek professional help instead.

[2022-12-22 08:59:33] <majormaverick11211> Here is a bit of reality to you guys:  1) Russia has NOT started the war, the US DID, by NOT providing Russia with guarantees that Ukraine would NOT join NATO, and the US refused... 2)Russia started this because it is defending its territory, the same way the US defended its territory during the Cuban missile crisis of 1960s...and even back then, the US started this by deploying nuclear missiles in Turkey (right on the Soviet border back then)...

[2022-12-22 09:00:50] <fuzzlefizz> @majormaverick11211  guarantees doesn't justify firing missiles into another country that can't defend itself from such attacks

[2022-12-22 09:01:00] <+eveningdownpour_> i have a degree in political science and im high as balls and reading that nuclear take was a singularity of humor
[2022-12-22 09:01:04] <gatorfu> I guess if the other countries admit they have to be treated like children then it's America's fault

[2022-12-22 09:39:23] <Deathening> The quality of sound is better on CD surely IF you have a real highend hifi setup, but its not very noticable on regular sound setups. so spotify quality is fine.

[2022-12-22 09:46:57] <%HaiTV> I think it was unsafe when they first connected neuralink to my brain.. I felt like I was dragged along by the AI for more than a year, always super fast and exhausting thoughts... it took a while to get used to before it slowed down
[2022-12-22 09:46:59] <Milad_96> @objec7_ NASA did the first vertical landing in 70s also he didn't invent Tesla, there were 2 other founders which elon joined just a year later. Its funny how he claims that Tesla was nothing before him but keep in mind it was only 1 year after he joined so obviously no Car company can boom in just 1 year

On December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas, pending potential extradition to the United States.

[2022-12-22 11:01:14] <n0rr1s> Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is a popular auto battler game mode in League of Legends where players build a team of champions and strategically position them on a board to fight against other players. The best strategy in TFT will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific champions and items you have available, the positioning of your champions on the board, and the overall meta (the most popular and successful strategies currently being used by players).
[2022-12-22 11:01:29] <n0rr1s> With that said, here are a few general tips that may help you improve your TFT strategy:      Build a balanced team: Try to create a team that has a mix of damage dealers, tanks, and support champions to cover all your bases.      Pay attention to synergies: Some champions have special abilities or bonuses when they are placed next to other champions with certain traits. Look for synergies that can help boost the power of your team.
