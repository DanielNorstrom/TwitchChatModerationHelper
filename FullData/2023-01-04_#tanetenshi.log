[2023-01-04 04:04:09] <skagtheprinceofhell> @jjhanzely The PS4 censoring that took out the cleaning mechanic. And broke the game. It wasn't a bug. They just took it out to censor the gamr.

When they released Mary Skelter 2 for switch, it included the first game. Since I'm going through the Vita version, haven't played the Switch version of the first game.
[2023-01-04 04:06:44] <Mistah_Mace> that's interesting. i would think it would be the other way around
