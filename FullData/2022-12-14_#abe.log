[2022-12-14 21:53:30] VIEWERS: 299
[2022-12-14 21:53:57] <$thebeckydodd> alpha testing is all about figuring about balancing...
[2022-12-14 21:55:05] <$thebeckydodd> I agree...I don't think you are not allowed to have input, but I think you also have to be accepting of the fact that there will be a lot changes in balancing
[2022-12-14 21:55:07] <%brovado89> your in a very unique role because if they make an error in the process of code you will discover it before anyone else gets to that point. Over time it chips  away the shock and aww of stratagizing in a game.
[2022-12-14 21:55:12] <%+bdpnguins> I understand but you are testing the game for the devs… after all most of the stuff in season 2 is still there in season 3… it just needs to be tested each idea is equally important in Season 3

[2022-12-14 21:56:13] <randompenguing> i get the splash potions, not really getting why relics ( to me a sort of staple of VH) is getting removed.
[2022-12-14 21:56:23] <Mr_Godlyzx> what did they change about it? sry late to that the stream
[2022-12-14 21:56:37] <%+bdpnguins> Oh yeah iskall said the Black Market will be buffed (the reroll and abandon features will require LESS bronze)
[2022-12-14 21:56:56] <cardiff_3> you have to start over when they could have hinted they were changing something
[2022-12-14 21:57:21] <ShxtteredxD> Any Tips on finding Chromatic Iron in VaultHunters?? I’ve gotten Full Netherite tools armour maxed tools mostly and gotten all the portal stuff an made villager trade halls villager potato farms an im about to beat the end an I’ve mined over 20k deepslate at y level -45 an I cannot for the life of me find it
[2022-12-14 21:57:21] <randompenguing> @bdpnguins Black Market, or Bounty Board? because sounds like you are describing the bounty board
[2022-12-14 21:57:22] <%juliancuten> the reason why games progress is because of alpha testers ( discuss/talk about the changes ? ) limit testing the game no?

[2022-12-14 21:57:31] <!%KaptainWutax> True, it's a bit unfortunate but you guys are the first people to play the pack so we don't have any other reference point. Buuuuut the fact that most devs are taking a break rn we have been a bit slow to rebalance and communicate, it will get better!
[2022-12-14 21:57:37] <$thebeckydodd> I guess my point is that (and I work in game development) sometimes you don't know that something will need to change until you actively see it being played in the alpha testing and then you have to re-balance for the next iteration.  I think your complaints,  opinions, and feedback are all important and valid

[2022-12-14 22:02:47] <tsboehm1> The conversation is necessary. It is important for both the developers and the players to understand each other and take note of what everyone is feeling about the updates. It is how improvements happen.
[2022-12-14 22:02:52] <ShxtteredxD> I’ve mined over 20k blocks
