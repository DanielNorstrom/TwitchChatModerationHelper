[2022-12-08 22:52:52] <%Arthandir> The main issue with 789 is that Johnson took 8 to deliberately shit over and disassemble any plothook set up in 7 and then Abrams being stuck to desperately try and salvage the clusterfuck. Not saying the Abrams movies were masterpieces, they were to close to a re-shot. But the series would have been better without Johnson

[2022-12-08 22:53:52] VIEWERS: 173
[2022-12-08 22:54:07] <SgtRoo> The reason they try to "force" is because it's such a good pop. culture movie that they know you'll enjoy it, so they "force" it because they feel like you've been missing out and they don't want you to miss out
[2022-12-08 22:54:07] <%b0x0d> also Gylo Gren is worst character You cannot change my mind

[2022-12-08 22:54:32] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> I mean I understand. everyone says that the big lebowski is the best thing since sliced bread. This is the most pointless movie I've ever seen. it's barely a movie, it's a sucession of images.

[2022-12-08 22:55:12] <SgtRoo> The 1 downside to star wars is that nowadays when people watch it's not as "impactful" due to the vast amount of references that have basically spoiled a lot of key aspects about the movies.
[2022-12-08 22:55:21] <%Arthandir> @LMAO_YEET_ 8 absolutely shat over all the established characters and their motivations and introduced a host of problems to the universe.
