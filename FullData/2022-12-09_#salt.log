[2022-12-09 02:17:10] <+generalformat123> off topic question, but for guild missions, what territory are manshuams under?
[2022-12-09 02:17:13] <artistfxx> even on potato mode that's like the only thing that fully renders xD
[2022-12-09 02:17:38] <artistfxx> @generalformat123 kama? why does it matter
[2022-12-09 02:17:42] <%+1fanimal> @generalformat123 if you trying do the guild boss scrolls. it doesnt matter where u get the kills. its any monsters on the map
[2022-12-09 02:18:04] <TwistyFisty1337> Do you have any Tipps and Tricks for newbies to Farm or getting Strong like you? I have actually 241 ap and im 61 mage
[2022-12-09 02:18:08] <%+1fanimal> i killed imps for my x2500
[2022-12-09 02:18:17] <+generalformat123> i was just wondering for the regular guild missions, i dont see kama as a territory pop up. maybe ive just missed it
[2022-12-09 02:18:48] <artistfxx> but like what does territory have to do with it?
[2022-12-09 02:18:59] <%+1fanimal> nothing
[2022-12-09 02:19:01] VIEWERS: 752
[2022-12-09 02:19:05] <%+1fanimal> its anymonsters
[2022-12-09 02:19:09] <artistfxx> exactly
[2022-12-09 02:19:23] <%+1fanimal> i took quest for puturum scroll and killed orcs
[2022-12-09 02:19:32] <+generalformat123> there are guild missions that say kill any monster in a specific territory so i was wondering if the territory mattered. They pop up w/ media or valencia requests and stuff
[2022-12-09 02:19:48] <+generalformat123> do those parts not matter and its truly just w/e monster?
[2022-12-09 02:20:10] <+Alfy_Stewart> black spirit giveth black spirit taketh
[2022-12-09 02:20:11] <%+1fanimal> @generalformat123 no it doesnt matter, i do them at imps while riding on a horse with my ranger
[2022-12-09 02:20:15] <Kaltharus> @generalformat123 i believe any monster will work.....the territory it says just determines the guild boss summon reward scroll

[2022-12-09 02:24:06] <%+1fanimal> @mochiiburrito its a marni stone that u fill it up with monster kills. its a rare drop
[2022-12-09 02:24:26] <%Nayfb> just swung - 0/14 on pen tung rings now :(
[2022-12-09 02:24:33] <dreggi> the stone also disappears once you exchange it, and you have to drop a new great marni stone

[2022-12-09 02:26:22] <%+1fanimal> @mochiiburrito the rare drop ones, that requires 10.000-30.000 kills
[2022-12-09 02:26:37] <+wrrwrrw> @GAZHKA47 you make worse money than grinding if you sell at tet

[2022-12-09 12:21:54] <+olxthebeast> @Salt I ve played alot of private servers and they would often give this acc hammer and yeah its to op , also if we get it would it be better for me to use it on neck or disto for my gear not selling
[2022-12-09 12:21:58] <%kaseiann> Would definately help the type of player that buys everything distos on sale after that :P
[2022-12-09 12:22:17] <bewater_2> so you say sell you pen disto befor it happen? xd

[2022-12-09 18:11:25] <+konibearUwU> pen acc prices tanking wouldnt help him the prices of the other enhance levels would probably go up including tets and bases
[2022-12-09 18:11:38] <+xr8djx> well not counting the third of a trillion u lost today
