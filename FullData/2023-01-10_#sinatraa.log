After three straight incidents of his behavior recently, I have disowned him. He is no longer a son of mine. I urge a boycott of Sentinels until they begin behaving like respectable men again.

[2023-01-10 03:11:00] <k4ib0xedu> sumo is easier less range of motion

[2023-01-10 03:11:06] <+McNuguid> I think conventional deadlift is harder due to the extended range of motion
[2023-01-10 03:11:09] <AdrianMarana> cos its hard to do it the right way

[2023-01-10 03:11:24] <+luuwlll> Sumo is easier because of the range of motion.

[2023-01-10 03:12:12] <+McNuguid> Also depneds on the persons anatomy.  A person with longer legs will likely be better doing sumo than conventional due to range of moition

[2023-01-10 09:05:58] <+LordCollins> @peepskii pushups bro
[2023-01-10 09:06:38] <%peepskii> man idk why but when i do pushups i can feel the tension on my triceps rather than my chests
