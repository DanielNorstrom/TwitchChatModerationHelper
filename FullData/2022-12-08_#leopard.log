[2022-12-08 01:37:12] <@%^Nightbot> Leopard uses an Azeron Cyborg Keypad (compact, medium, curved palmrest). The thumbstick is mapped to WASD for movement. It took Lep about two weeks to get used to a keypad with a thumbstick.

[2022-12-08 13:26:57] <%autopatch> Time to build an addition with all those strimmer bucks
[2022-12-08 13:27:03] <%Momokat18> There is always room - hoarders
[2022-12-08 13:27:15] <%autopatch> GSXRClyde bought a whole ass house with his strimmer bucks
[2022-12-08 13:27:50] <%autopatch> Well, he doesn't have kids. But he does have a dog. So I guess it balances out.

[2022-12-08 13:29:14] <%autopatch> Can you imagine? Strimmer Dad Shed by Lep in the backyard next to the hot tub?

[2022-12-08 13:30:01] <%autopatch> She Shed is so 1990's. Strimmer Shed is 2030's.
[2022-12-08 13:30:35] <%autopatch> lepBRAIN
[2022-12-08 13:32:19] <~%Leopard> This test virtual studio takes up 35-40% of a 3090
[2022-12-08 13:33:09] <%Tiago_> lepOOF
[2022-12-08 13:33:12] <~%Leopard> Which tells me I 100% need a 3rd PC
[2022-12-08 13:33:42] <%$Travis_Adams> yea that's a lot of rendering work for a GPU to put out scenes like that.
[2022-12-08 13:33:45] <~%Leopard> My stream PC's 3060Ti with OBS open on my main scene "idles" at 45% usage
[2022-12-08 13:34:01] <%Mr_216> lepBRAIN
[2022-12-08 13:34:28] <%Tiago_> heres a idea Lep, take your current streaming PC for the VR, change the GPU, and ask to PowerGPU a small form streaming PC??
[2022-12-08 13:34:29] <%Momokat18> lepOOF
[2022-12-08 13:35:24] <%$Travis_Adams> Next thing you know Lep will be building a rendering farm KEKW
[2022-12-08 13:35:35] <%Tiago_> you will not need a huge power pc for stream if you have third for the VR
[2022-12-08 13:35:50] <%Tiago_> KEKW Travis
[2022-12-08 13:36:38] <%Tiago_> does google rent the old Stadia servers for VR?? lepLOL
[2022-12-08 13:36:40] <~%Leopard> my stream PC already has rendering lag
[2022-12-08 13:36:47] <~%Leopard> Whenever multiple things are happening
[2022-12-08 13:36:49] <%RoastedTats> Waiting room lep7
[2022-12-08 13:36:53] <~%Leopard> due to GPU (I think)
[2022-12-08 13:37:14] <%Tiago_> Tats lepH
[2022-12-08 13:37:24] <%RoastedTats> Tiago lepH
[2022-12-08 13:37:26] <~%Leopard> It's because(I think) I (unlike 100% of other streamers) run a 4k base OBS canvas so I can digitally zoom my face cam dynamically
[2022-12-08 13:37:33] <~%Leopard> without loss of quality
[2022-12-08 13:38:08] <~%Leopard> nothing is easy when you do stuff no one else does lepDESPAIR
[2022-12-08 13:38:33] <%+Serthren> The sacrifice you go through to give us our 4k zoomed in beauty shots lepHUG
[2022-12-08 13:39:59] <~%Leopard> And if I change the base canvas rez, it moves all 100 sources
[2022-12-08 13:40:00] <~%Leopard> lepLOL
[2022-12-08 13:40:24] <%Tiago_> you have a 3090 on the gaminc PC right? time to switch, put the 3090 on the strreaming PC and test the the redering if the lag continue
[2022-12-08 13:40:36] <%Tiago_> 100 sources???? lepD
[2022-12-08 13:40:59] <%autopatch> All the memes need all the sources
[2022-12-08 13:41:19] <~%Leopard> @Tiago_ need a bigger PSU
[2022-12-08 13:41:26] <%Tiago_> lepOOF
[2022-12-08 13:41:44] <%$Travis_Adams> what's the supply in the stream PC?
[2022-12-08 13:41:50] <%Tiago_> ^
[2022-12-08 13:42:26] <%$Esskah> you could try to cram the streaming PC and the VR PC into SFF Cases. A Fractal Design Ridge fits some 4090s, you could move to external radiators for chunky CPU if needed.
[2022-12-08 13:42:29] <%Tiago_> 5950x + 3090 , needs at least a 800W i think
[2022-12-08 13:43:50] <~%Leopard> 800w
[2022-12-08 13:43:53] <%$Esskah> bequiet has a pretty ok calculator on their homepage
[2022-12-08 13:44:06] <~%Leopard> but I had that in the gaming PC and it had to be downclocked before I got a 1000w
[2022-12-08 13:44:16] <~%Leopard> and it's CPU is a 10850
[2022-12-08 13:44:28] <~%Leopard> And my streaming PC has loads of peripherals
[2022-12-08 13:44:37] <~%Leopard> I might be able to test it but TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME

[2022-12-08 15:58:34] <@%^Nightbot> Worth is different to everyone. Some people value loot. Some people value missions. So people want 40 hours of content. Some people would be happy with 2. Measuring "worth" for a specific person is determined by their preferences and what they enjoy, which means there is no universal answer to 'is it worth it'.  For what it's "worth", so far Leopard is enjoying Witch Queen content more than Beyond Light because Savathun > Eramis.

[2022-12-08 17:19:10] <DefBref> This feature was added by Microsoft to alert users when a window is being captured. It cannot be disabled. It is there to act as an indicator for the end user in case some malware sneaks onto your machine and starts using the capture API to watch your windows to steal data, for example. As OBS is capturing these windows (at your request, by pointing a window or game capture at them), the yellow 'window is being captured' alert surround indicator is activated. There is no way to turn it off.
