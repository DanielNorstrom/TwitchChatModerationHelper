[2023-01-10 08:06:30] <%+theesycotik> It had a tourney for one year
[2023-01-10 08:06:30] <%BLZbubs> and then it got a smash character
[2023-01-10 08:06:31] <$Niles_SadKFPEmployee> People were obsessed?
[2023-01-10 08:06:35] <!Maethra> that's pretty much every fighting game
[2023-01-10 08:06:36] <!%garfield1187> pretty much yeah

[2023-01-10 08:06:38] <+Ciruya> never played it
[2023-01-10 08:06:38] <%OniGhoste> that was the exact experience
[2023-01-10 08:06:40] <CptNameless> Most definitely

[2023-01-10 08:06:49] <%thezacsterr> why in smash
[2023-01-10 08:06:50] <!%garfield1187> i dont think it got the competitive scene it wanted
[2023-01-10 08:06:52] <%+Carte422> everybody talked about it for a week because it was free for a week
[2023-01-10 08:06:54] <%thezacsterr> of all the character's
[2023-01-10 08:06:58] <%+Carte422> nobody was gonna pay $60 for it lmao
[2023-01-10 08:06:59] <+Ciruya> because shes cute
[2023-01-10 08:07:00] <!%Heroes_of_Vale> I imagine the meta-game got solved and it was too fucky for people to want to play. That or the online sucked too bad. Just speculating.
[2023-01-10 08:07:02] <%DaveSPV> and when that new character came out there was a ressurgence
[2023-01-10 08:07:04] <eggbreadz> min min cute, also Nintendo exclusive
[2023-01-10 08:07:06] <%+paintchip> It was full-price for, like, 2 hours of content
[2023-01-10 08:07:08] <%$nicky_ray_> but still no waluigi
[2023-01-10 08:07:10] <%thezacsterr> why sakurai
[2023-01-10 08:07:16] <%BLZbubs> free advertising
[2023-01-10 08:07:16] <!%mister_z_1994> The producer said some bullshit like "Everybody's the main character!" when really Min Min was his waifu
[2023-01-10 08:07:16] <%OniGhoste> their last attempt to make arms relevant
[2023-01-10 08:07:20] <@%shoukenz> all i remember is min min and that ojou twintails girl
[2023-01-10 08:07:21] <+AugmentedTTV> you pee?
[2023-01-10 08:07:21] <%goombaroni> add the arms guy but not my boi goku smh
[2023-01-10 08:07:22] <$Dreken337> new big pp
[2023-01-10 08:07:25] <CptNameless> Arms 2 when?
[2023-01-10 08:07:27] <%+theesycotik> But they have better big IPs like Splatoon
[2023-01-10 08:07:31] <SoZased> I can't believe Mari Mari is in Smash
[2023-01-10 08:07:31] <%thezacsterr> they thought it'd be a hit smh
[2023-01-10 08:07:33] <eggbreadz> I'd slurp off Min Min's arms ngl
[2023-01-10 08:07:37] VIEWERS: 408
[2023-01-10 08:07:44] <%OniGhoste> it was supposed to have tournaments and everything
[2023-01-10 08:07:48] <CptNameless> Call it 2 Arms.
[2023-01-10 08:07:49] <%OniGhoste> but it had very little depth
[2023-01-10 08:07:56] <!Maethra> they made an effort
[2023-01-10 08:07:58] <%DaveSPV> L + ratio + fell off
[2023-01-10 08:07:58] <!%mister_z_1994> It felt more like the next Splatoon to me, but we knew Splatoon 2 was a thing before Arms was revealed
[2023-01-10 08:08:00] <%thezacsterr> should've used cute girls instead smh
[2023-01-10 08:08:01] <+RockheadRumple69> about time for them
[2023-01-10 08:08:09] <!Maethra> then realized they didn't have to make an effort and could coast on the success of the switch
[2023-01-10 08:08:12] <%goombaroni> splatoon looks like a lot of fun
[2023-01-10 08:08:13] <%+paintchip> It was Wii Sports boxing except mediocre
[2023-01-10 08:08:21] <$electriccube_rhubarb> some can be a jab
[2023-01-10 08:08:23] <%$nicky_ray_> it does have catchy music too
[2023-01-10 08:08:27] <eggbreadz> Splatoon looks like its fun for like a day at best imo
[2023-01-10 08:08:29] <%+theesycotik> There on Splatoon 3 which seems to do well

[2023-01-10 09:47:59] VIEWERS: 614
[2023-01-10 09:48:02] <%BLZbubs> ketamine is a very effective antidepressant, can confirm
[2023-01-10 09:48:06] <!%garfield1187> im so depressed give me ket
[2023-01-10 09:48:07] <+dwwynn> @marimari_en they have a dr near me thats licensed to do ketamine therapy here in cali
[2023-01-10 09:48:08] <Frank_Dreadnought> count down backwards from infinity
[2023-01-10 09:48:10] <$Rickbane> I am more happy knocked out
[2023-01-10 09:48:11] <%terminusxs> it lets you focus on something and also tells them when you go under apparently
[2023-01-10 09:48:14] <%CrustGlizzy> I mean ngl ketamine probably would make people less depressed
[2023-01-10 09:48:18] <%+methodicbox816> I had to go under one (1) time and I overslept by like 4 hours after surgery
[2023-01-10 09:48:38] <+RockheadRumple69> most recreational drugs will help depression
[2023-01-10 09:48:39] <%$nicky_ray_> one time my buddy was getting a tooth surgery done around halloween and the dentist knicked a vein and blood spewed on the walls and my buddy thought it was a halloween prank
[2023-01-10 09:48:39] <%terminusxs> I have a family member that just went for it
[2023-01-10 09:48:42] <@%SnorlaxBud> someone I know is going thru test treatments, they say its really helpful
[2023-01-10 09:48:51] <RackemFrackem> yeah experimental ketamine treatment is part of what made Jordan Peterson crazier
[2023-01-10 09:49:00] <+maxstew7> just spend your money on anime merch instead for long lasting anti depressants
[2023-01-10 09:49:04] <%BLZbubs> you go in for treatments at a clinic, you don't take it home usually
[2023-01-10 09:49:09] <!%$RJ2theLA2> Actually, it seems the teeth of Brits are actually healthier be than Americans' teeth. According to the latest figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average 12-year-old child in the UK has 0.7 missing or filled teeth.Sep 17, 2021

[2023-01-10 09:49:52] <%GodaroC> My worst root canal experience was just because the dentist used too much anesthesia so for the following week I actually couldn't move my jaw without it hurting

Then she says "Don't worry, I brought protection for you" and she pulls a chain of 100 condoms from out of her empty palm. Finally, when she's going to put the condom on with her mouth instead she quickly blows the condom up into a balloon dog.

[2023-01-10 10:24:07] <SirToumax> Having a 18 as president would be funny
[2023-01-10 10:24:23] <slai20> it's 35 but ppl vote for 80+ ppl anyway LUL
[2023-01-10 10:24:23] <%Paint2D> If the people vote for a 18 year old why not
[2023-01-10 10:24:23] <$Rickbane> should be a maximum age limit
[2023-01-10 10:24:26] <%beerbearian> as someone who has passed 30, but not hit 35, I do not feel old enoigh to be president of anything
[2023-01-10 10:24:26] <!Fridge_Draws> would you vote for a 27 year old candidate?
[2023-01-10 10:24:27] <%theandeemon> 27 is still very young
[2023-01-10 10:24:30] <%+paintchip> Having someone in their mid-20s would be hilarious

[2023-01-10 11:50:33] <+maxstew7> one definition of meme is "an element of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means.", so memes being the DNA of the soul makes sense, its passed down thoughts
