[2022-12-25 17:51:35] <%dustin_black3385> I think it‚Äôs unfair to say any pick into any other hero is throwing. rein has options against Orisa, it‚Äôs just Orisa counters rein. it‚Äôd be the same as playing ball against a sombra

[2022-12-25 21:03:39] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-25 21:51:18] <@%^StreamElements> oaxith, To earn drops you must claim them from your Twitch Inventory. You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops/inventory
