[2022-12-20 12:52:14] <itsbigoz16> The black series goes for like 3 mil so he’s getting a good deal
[2022-12-20 12:52:15] <titanupszn> pdm doesnt have contracts my bad didnt know
[2022-12-20 12:52:17] <kaidzx> you talking about sk
[2022-12-20 12:52:21] <%s1ndd3r> and more resale value

[2022-12-20 12:52:34] <+ZinoStreamz> Chat just be making up things
[2022-12-20 12:52:37] <angell89> I don't think SK will get the Black Series because the Owner of PDM is messing around Tommy Cruiser and SK
[2022-12-20 12:52:39] <BillyJoint> if he gets lambo he wants to flip it
[2022-12-20 12:52:48] <kaidzx> black series is hard to get tho
[2022-12-20 12:53:04] <kaidzx> he can get thee lambo today
[2022-12-20 12:53:08] <luks10s> @BillyJoint he would only be able to sell for less, that car is cheeks
[2022-12-20 12:53:15] <Foxy1608> He won’t get black series, Kevin ram said someone is already getting it
[2022-12-20 12:53:17] <Abi2abakaZz> Flip it how when there’s 2/3 murci trying to be sold?
