[2022-12-17 12:53:38] <+SteppyStreams> Zach right
[2022-12-17 12:53:43] <+SteppyStreams> Let me pitch an idea to you
[2022-12-17 12:54:01] <%kaansept> snipe would be a menace if he got some movement
[2022-12-17 12:54:09] <%kaansept> more of a menace**
[2022-12-17 12:54:21] <endeverisclever> alb has too much of an ego tbh
[2022-12-17 12:54:26] <wagwandalf86> ego's are faze's downfall
[2022-12-17 12:54:26] <endeverisclever> he literally doesnt listen
[2022-12-17 12:54:34] <+kanedyy> hello everyone ^^
[2022-12-17 12:54:48] <!Swagheel> DonoWall
[2022-12-17 12:55:19] <endeverisclever> nah dude, let me say it rounded
[2022-12-17 12:55:28] <minibenderr> Would they benefit from a coach?
[2022-12-17 12:55:31] <endeverisclever> alb is insanely talented but he doesnt listen becuz of that if that makes sense
[2022-12-17 12:55:59] <arjen_vh> they just need to figure out what comp they actually wanne play
[2022-12-17 12:56:02] <%BigBeeTheGamer> Yooo what‚Äôs up Zach? A little early banger?
[2022-12-17 12:56:03] <minibenderr> Snipe out naughty in?
[2022-12-17 12:56:04] <we5ty___> Faze has too many chiefs
[2022-12-17 12:56:09] <%BigBeeTheGamer> What‚Äôs up chat?
[2022-12-17 12:56:25] <%+brickhearted> That roster has a zero percent chance of working. Respectfully I think albs time is up. He‚Äôs a team vibe destroyer. One of the best mechanically so it‚Äôs a shame
[2022-12-17 12:56:26] <+Lt_Dan_Gaming> I feel like they fight with there comms too much idk. Like having to repeat calls cuz someone talks over and I mean every team that happens. But they have egos for sure
[2022-12-17 12:57:09] <chappabandzz> I been finding out all day tha deres sm aim modders on console im considering quitting fr
[2022-12-17 12:57:14] <GhostReaperFPS> is igl needed for rank? or is it different?
[2022-12-17 12:57:59] <+Lt_Dan_Gaming> Just something they gotta really work on. You never know tho.
[2022-12-17 12:58:06] <!Swagheel> i feel like if All 3 wanted to hire a coach then it could work. putting aside all the ego by all the players together to see what works
[2022-12-17 12:58:08] <+jcoleman77> FlyQuest Zach and Mon back together? Haha
[2022-12-17 12:58:15] <!Swagheel> coz mechanically they got what it takes
[2022-12-17 12:58:20] <schmuttt> zach do you think alb needs an IGL with him or do you think he can learn to be a top level one in ALGS with faze?
[2022-12-17 12:58:26] <%+brickhearted> The only problem is alb can‚Äôt play a different role it seems. Like when he was with you I felt like he just spoke over you and with everyone he‚Äôs with.
[2022-12-17 12:58:27] <chappabandzz> Ran into 3 tdy n dey always on da other team str8 gettin beam without them lookin at me
[2022-12-17 12:58:38] <+iamblowed> Lan ready teams?
[2022-12-17 12:58:52] <%+brickhearted> Exactly !
[2022-12-17 12:59:03] <+Lt_Dan_Gaming> Yea 100% agree
[2022-12-17 12:59:35] <mestrada02> That‚Äôs where a coach wound help them
[2022-12-17 12:59:37] <!Swagheel> you saw the hals "no no" call during hyperluxe yesterday? after asking reps to seer ult
[2022-12-17 12:59:41] <mestrada02> Would
[2022-12-17 12:59:49] <+Lt_Dan_Gaming> He has the knowledge and game sense for sure. Just new to it

[2022-12-17 13:00:57] <!Swagheel> @brickhearted yea it was just weird call coz hal rewatched and couldnt understand why he said that but his teammates were so understanding. was a cool moment to watch
[2022-12-17 13:00:59] <raizen29> Are you in ALGS?

[2022-12-17 15:39:53] <+HighBorNate> you only need gold 4 to compete to qualify for algs is what I keep reading

[2022-12-17 15:40:30] <galaxy_ipa> Are you leaving comp @zachmazer
[2022-12-17 15:40:48] <%pray4jeremy> Yeah gold 4 is minimum rank to sign up for open wualifiers

[2022-12-17 15:41:01] <+HighBorNate> that's so badass
[2022-12-17 15:41:05] <lMoosel> I thought they dropped it to like silver
[2022-12-17 15:41:18] <+HighBorNate> silver 2 or 4 now actually

[2022-12-17 15:42:08] <lMoosel> Silver is too low imo
[2022-12-17 15:42:39] <Heathen_ggs> @lMoosel I played with silver dudes who play better than Master, rank system dont mean shit when it comes to raw skill
[2022-12-17 15:43:04] <lMoosel> I get that but if your half decent it takes like a day to get to gold
[2022-12-17 15:43:07] <+HighBorNate> agreed. silver is too low I think. keep it at gold 4

[2022-12-17 15:47:42] <Heathen_ggs> what do you think about Alliance? They any good?
[2022-12-17 15:47:57] <+HighBorNate> faze problem is that they don't trust any of their own calls. they do their own thing and the trust is not there between them all
[2022-12-17 15:48:28] <+TuSwaizyy> @HighBorNate that is soooooo true
[2022-12-17 15:48:40] <+HighBorNate> once they start believing in the igl and not taking from eachothers calls and following the igl they will be great again
[2022-12-17 15:48:50] <wydra541> Did C9 leave apex?
[2022-12-17 15:48:57] <+naughty_bo1> why is tsm so good
[2022-12-17 15:49:16] <+HighBorNate> because they' listen to eachorher calls no matter what
[2022-12-17 15:49:18] <+TuSwaizyy> i think ali needs to more of a agressivce IGL he doesnt say anything with confidence in my opinion.
[2022-12-17 15:49:19] <+naughty_bo1> nr
[2022-12-17 15:49:53] <+HighBorNate> @tuswaizyy this is true. once snipefown can stay humble to ali calls they will get better

[2022-12-17 16:08:12] <+wilrays97> How??? I think it‚Äôs stupid how you lose AA to a character‚Äôs ability

[2022-12-17 16:08:42] <%FAnaite> @wilrays97 so you say, if you cant see the enemy you still should have aimassist?
[2022-12-17 16:08:43] <+wilrays97> Lol
[2022-12-17 16:08:56] <+HighBorNate> HisWattson was the only M&K player in algs to hit top 10
[2022-12-17 16:09:03] <lMoosel> @wilrays97 you could find and shoot the enemy without knowing where they were
[2022-12-17 16:09:11] <sir_robot1> streamer loot
[2022-12-17 16:09:12] <+wilrays97> No but with a dt you should for sure
[2022-12-17 16:09:31] <+wilrays97> And that shit does not just lock on to peopleüòÇ
[2022-12-17 16:09:48] <%FAnaite> @wilrays97 so you say a single item in the game should make you able to get back aimassist?
[2022-12-17 16:09:56] <%FAnaite> in smokes
[2022-12-17 16:10:01] <ayush833> tomorrow serous match
[2022-12-17 16:10:07] <A_PerfectEnd> I hate how people sleep on the Hemi-Mastiff purple bolt combo. shit goes insane
[2022-12-17 16:10:11] <+wilrays97> But not trying to start an argument in chat so I‚Äôll just leave it at this!
[2022-12-17 16:10:11] <putridbigsmoke> @wilrays97 adding AA just to DT would be too much coding for the lazy devs
[2022-12-17 16:10:14] <ayush833> u guys are not in by 1 point right?
[2022-12-17 16:10:19] <%FAnaite> k
[2022-12-17 16:10:27] <+HighBorNate> I think they finally did bang right by taking away aim assist in her smoke
[2022-12-17 16:10:38] <lMoosel> I could see dt giving AA in smokes but thats a pain to program
[2022-12-17 16:10:51] <+sellbanger> now they just need to reduce the visual clutter than controllers also get aim assist through
[2022-12-17 16:11:11] <iiTzBlueSky_> @zachmazer what is the one team that you are most cautious to 3v3 in comp?
[2022-12-17 16:11:27] <+HighBorNate> apex has the least amount of Aim Assist in any FPS game

[2022-12-17 16:21:27] <A_PerfectEnd> if you ever un into a Lag switch Cheater @zachmazer the key to getting hit regs, and kills is abuse aim assist. don't move your right stick at all. just strafe with left stuck

[2022-12-17 16:29:22] <+atrainvt> You should start playing with snipe and slurp to see if you got chemistry

[2022-12-17 16:30:19] <+ARV303> would you be down to play with another igl just as fragger?
[2022-12-17 16:30:31] <georgejr007> If ur a casual should u just play controller or mnk
[2022-12-17 16:30:44] <+atrainvt> I think Zach would prefer being a fragger
[2022-12-17 16:30:47] <jonathnhuerta> Damn
[2022-12-17 16:30:51] <brandonwhisler17> Your in HisWattson game
[2022-12-17 16:31:06] <+ARV303> must be really exausting to be an IGL
[2022-12-17 16:31:12] <AVERYbax38> @brandonwhisler17 why say that
[2022-12-17 16:31:37] <skanterfanter> why would he be a fragger @atrainvt that makes literally no sense
[2022-12-17 16:31:42] <+atrainvt> Zach you were on a roll with shooby wernt you
[2022-12-17 16:31:45] <putridbigsmoke> 1 hp repeek monka
[2022-12-17 16:32:00] <+ARV303> @skanterfanter why not? can you elaborate
[2022-12-17 16:32:13] <+atrainvt> @skanterfanter Actually it does make sense because maybe he doesn‚Äôt want the added pressure of IGLing
[2022-12-17 16:32:17] <skanterfanter> because he has 3 years of igling experience and the scene is controller dominated
[2022-12-17 16:32:34] <+atrainvt> Doesn‚Äôt mean he wants to tho that‚Äôs what your missing
[2022-12-17 16:32:39] <%dogshitguy> zach04Head zach04Head zach04Head zach04Head zach04Head
[2022-12-17 16:32:40] <+atrainvt> Maybe he‚Äôd be better off as a fragger
[2022-12-17 16:32:51] <+ARV303> that doesn't stop mnk players being fraggers
[2022-12-17 16:33:03] <+ARV303> unfortunately not top 10 fraggers apparently
[2022-12-17 16:33:03] <+atrainvt> Exactly @arv303
[2022-12-17 16:33:37] <brandonwhisler17> Your in HisWattson game
[2022-12-17 16:33:40] <+atrainvt> If we look at all the best teams they have any mixture of mnk and controllers
[2022-12-17 16:33:45] <+ARV303> maybe fragger/co-igl
[2022-12-17 16:34:01] <+xProAngler> i appreciate if you stop playing as the same time aS me thanks :)
[2022-12-17 16:34:15] <+ARV303> @atrainvt yeah, is there any top team on NA thats full aim assist?

[2022-12-17 16:36:58] <+atrainvt> Yea you gotta be impressed when two or Tripods players were 2 years late to the apex scene and doing this well

[2022-12-17 16:37:58] <+ARV303> @atrainvt ikr? i was skeptikal about nick at first but he is so fucking commited
[2022-12-17 16:38:13] <+atrainvt> Nick has the most passion
[2022-12-17 16:38:23] <linkastarta> @atrainvt whats more impressive is nick is becoming more of an igl than gent lol
[2022-12-17 16:38:25] <+HighBorNate> most teams are 2 roller and one m&k player  ..
[2022-12-17 16:38:30] <+atrainvt> We can‚Äôt forget that Nick has been competing at a high level in a lot of other games too
[2022-12-17 16:38:46] <+ARV303> yeah but apex/BRs are another level
[2022-12-17 16:38:48] <+atrainvt> @highbornate I said most top teams
[2022-12-17 16:38:52] <+atrainvt> Look at the top 5
[2022-12-17 16:39:01] <+HighBorNate> nick merks literally switched games and became top player .. that's insanely hard to do.
[2022-12-17 16:39:17] <+HighBorNate> the top 10 players were all roller minus hiswattson because he's built different
[2022-12-17 16:39:21] <Kema4> @HighBorNate What other games did he play before?
[2022-12-17 16:39:30] <%+taviewankenobi> @highbornate bro top player?
[2022-12-17 16:39:38] <+HighBorNate> exactly
[2022-12-17 16:39:50] <%dogshitguy> insane
[2022-12-17 16:40:02] <LW_FakeMassiah> yuck
[2022-12-17 16:40:03] <+HighBorNate> a hater going to disagree but tell me someone else who's putting Hal into a deathbox ad much as nick these days
[2022-12-17 16:40:07] <%+taviewankenobi> Their team is a top 20 team in NA, but he is not a top player. Other than being like a top 60 player. Which is awesome for sure.
[2022-12-17 16:40:17] <%pray4jeremy> Bang lowkey has the most slept on passive in the game
[2022-12-17 16:40:20] <+ARV303> Gears of War and Halo, apparently
[2022-12-17 16:40:25] <+HighBorNate> not saying he's Hal or even top 5 lmao . I'm saying they are someone to look out for
[2022-12-17 16:40:28] <+atrainvt> Don‚Äôt forget Fortnite

[2022-12-17 16:40:56] <+atrainvt> They‚Äôve been around the longest
[2022-12-17 16:40:59] <recckitralph> He's been pro in 4 different games
[2022-12-17 16:41:03] <%pray4jeremy> But he is not a top 60 NA apex player lol
[2022-12-17 16:41:13] <+HighBorNate> he was pro in gears of War... before he was even partner he was signed
[2022-12-17 16:41:16] <%pray4jeremy> He earned his spot
[2022-12-17 16:41:17] <%+taviewankenobi> @highbornate sure, I mean it‚Äôs impressive to be a top 20 team in NA. He is a professional gamer tho so it is his job. His passion and drive is so impressive for sure.
[2022-12-17 16:41:20] <+HighBorNate> insanity. than halo ...
[2022-12-17 16:41:38] <+HighBorNate> every game nick goes into he becomes top player in .. say something different lmak

[2022-12-17 16:42:16] <lothbrockv> tf does that mean no top team is looking for nick

[2022-12-17 16:43:33] <theresidentnoob> i do
[2022-12-17 16:43:41] <%+taviewankenobi> @highbornate yeah I think people understate how good Deeds and Gent are. Nick is carried by them skill wise in my opinion but brings the passion and drive they need to be good.
[2022-12-17 16:43:43] <+ARV303> @atrainvt probably would have won some major championship honestly
[2022-12-17 16:43:46] <%bigchiefin13> Idk nick is good but he got carried to pro league mehh imo
[2022-12-17 16:43:47] <%Dstigler12> The Mauer Topps now card is 1B primary lmao
[2022-12-17 16:44:01] <AVERYbax38> 2 pro teams vs each other damn
[2022-12-17 16:44:22] <+HighBorNate> I doubt that he got carried.  he like everyone learned from playing with other pros.
[2022-12-17 16:44:23] <+atrainvt> From what I‚Äôve been seeing lately Nick isn‚Äôt getting carried at all
[2022-12-17 16:44:24] <+ARV303> i think the impressive thing about Nick is the speed of his evolution
[2022-12-17 16:44:30] <+atrainvt> I haven‚Äôt missed an ALGS game
[2022-12-17 16:44:33] <+ARV303> is less than a yeah
[2022-12-17 16:44:36] <+ARV303> year
[2022-12-17 16:44:58] <+KennyTheCurse> nick still needs to improve his decision making but his rate of improvement is impreesing
[2022-12-17 16:45:04] <+atrainvt> At the beginning he was getting carried now he‚Äôs showing up and that‚Äôs why they are placing top 10 now in points
[2022-12-17 16:45:04] <sam_9a> yeah you cant really say nick has been carried hes doing his part
[2022-12-17 16:45:12] <+HighBorNate> haters will hate on nick but I don't see anyone else who came into apex with this big of waves
[2022-12-17 16:45:17] <+cooliotwitch> who u got winning playoffs
[2022-12-17 16:45:20] <theresidentnoob> @ARV303 always impressive when you have the bankroll to immediately play with top players day 1

[2022-12-17 16:45:54] <+atrainvt> I don‚Äôt understand the Nick hate tbh. Probably jealousy. They hate him cause they ain‚Äôt him
[2022-12-17 16:45:54] <+ARV303> @ARV303 yeah, that a major factor, obviously

[2022-12-17 16:47:47] <tylercufs> I do like nick and I think he is improving at a incredible rate but the mfam mafia is something totally different his fans r toxic in my opinion
[2022-12-17 16:47:51] <+pPrime_> @awesomeandrew30 he hit pred with 72hrs and Cloakzy before he ever played with a pro player, what are you talking about lmaooo
[2022-12-17 16:47:58] <+HighBorNate> lol weak ? your choice of words are class.
[2022-12-17 16:47:58] <+atrainvt> They went from placing like 15th and lower the first half of the ALGS days and now they are placing inside the top 10 is what I‚Äôm saying
[2022-12-17 16:48:02] <%+taviewankenobi> @awesomeandrew30 no his whole gaming career earned him that. He is a legend.
[2022-12-17 16:48:05] <%+dkotik> Ironically I remember Hal, Zach, and sweet all being confused about Dz coming to NA. Now they likely don't qualify to Lan.

[2022-12-17 16:50:30] <%+taviewankenobi> @highbornate no I said people don‚Äôt like when his fans are dick sucking, a term akin to kissing his ass etc. meaning inflating what he is doing in an obnoxious way. Which is what you were doing‚Ä¶ I am a Nick Mercs fan. That response to someone else. Again grow up.
[2022-12-17 16:50:45] <+ARV303> you gotta separate the streamer from his community
[2022-12-17 16:50:50] <+atrainvt> Your logic is that if people support nick they are d riding. But the truth is that your statement proves your a hater. You hate nick more than we like him so who really has a problem?

[2022-12-17 16:52:43] <tylercufs> @taviewankenobi speak!!!!!

[2022-12-17 16:52:55] <tylercufs> @skyfallincj couldn‚Äôt agree more
[2022-12-17 16:52:55] <%+taviewankenobi> @highbornate üòÇüòÇI have no face to save. I literally never said he sucked. Said they are a top 20 team and he is a top 60 player which are facts. End of story.
[2022-12-17 16:53:01] <+ARV303> @murray879 i think people are pointing out he arguably had a noticeable evolutionm is the past few months
[2022-12-17 16:53:03] <+atrainvt> @skyfallincj I don‚Äôt think your brain works that fast after that sentence
[2022-12-17 16:53:04] <+KennyTheCurse> @theresidentnoob lel the best part
[2022-12-17 16:53:12] <%+taviewankenobi> @theresidentnoob üòÇ for sure. It‚Äôs part of his style now

[2022-12-17 16:53:53] <+atrainvt> Can‚Äôt deny that
[2022-12-17 16:53:57] <+HighBorNate> Beams !!!! let's goo

[2022-12-17 16:54:21] <lothbrockv> that's his strong point his mentality
[2022-12-17 16:54:21] <+SteelyTitan985> and he's rich so he doesn't need to do what he's doing now but he is
[2022-12-17 16:54:24] <lothbrockv> but he's not good
[2022-12-17 16:54:24] <%+taviewankenobi> @atrainvt won‚Äôt argue that at all. His passion is unmatched.
[2022-12-17 16:54:25] <theresidentnoob> 90% of these 'pros' dont even want to pay more than 6 hours a day
[2022-12-17 16:54:49] <tylercufs> @theresidentnoob play* lol

[2022-12-17 16:55:00] <%+taviewankenobi> @lothbrockv that‚Äôs like saying ANY professional sports player is not good lol. They are still better than all of us
[2022-12-17 16:55:02] <+ARV303> @theresidentnoob yeah, i guess a lot of the pro's are burnt out but didn't figure that out yet
[2022-12-17 16:55:25] <+ARV303> and the lack of quality scrims and high tier lobby don't help either
[2022-12-17 16:55:28] <+atrainvt> Nick is fresh to the scene also a lot of these pros are burnt out cause of the miles
[2022-12-17 16:55:40] <tylercufs> ^^^^

[2022-12-17 17:02:15] <+speedyissweaty> @zachmazer Are these your new tm8s or are you still looking best of luck btw!
[2022-12-17 17:02:30] <GodiiiWhiff> No one talks about Illspooky but he‚Äôs a mad man on roller no kizzy
[2022-12-17 17:02:32] <+atrainvt> JayCue is nuts but no one knows him
[2022-12-17 17:02:42] <+atrainvt> He could be top 10 not even kidding
[2022-12-17 17:02:54] <theresidentnoob> @atrainvt youre trying to list top players but have only been following the legend Zachmazer for 13 mins.. cant take your info serious

[2022-12-17 17:03:38] <%Dstigler12> Just gotta find the non trollers and you gain east

[2022-12-17 17:03:46] <+atrainvt> True
[2022-12-17 17:04:04] <+atrainvt> Pandxrz is stupid cracked also
[2022-12-17 17:04:17] <linkastarta> verhulst is good but he's kinda one trick valkyrie
[2022-12-17 17:04:37] <+atrainvt> TSM has been absolutely hitting their stride lately
[2022-12-17 17:04:44] <GodiiiWhiff> @linkastarta What‚Äôs the one trick ?
[2022-12-17 17:04:52] <theresidentnoob> using valk
[2022-12-17 17:04:55] <%Dstigler12> TSM looked nuts on Thursday
[2022-12-17 17:05:02] <theresidentnoob> datamining
[2022-12-17 17:05:20] <+atrainvt> They look like the best team rn imo
[2022-12-17 17:05:20] <%Dstigler12> Yup had to be that lmao
[2022-12-17 17:05:27] <linkastarta> if verhulst could use other legends than valk then he'll definitely be top 1 roller player
[2022-12-17 17:05:27] <+speedyissweaty> Verhulst has just used Valk so much he‚Äôs so used to the jet pack and abilities fr
[2022-12-17 17:05:42] <theresidentnoob> i heard tsm wearing buttplugs and raven vibrates them if theyre going the wrong direction
[2022-12-17 17:06:02] <theresidentnoob> datamining just one piece of it
[2022-12-17 17:06:11] <+atrainvt> Valk is always gonna be used in comp anyways for the time being so it kinda works out
[2022-12-17 17:06:12] <GodiiiWhiff> I can see Hal wearing one forsure
[2022-12-17 17:06:15] <murray879> Is there anything more boring than watching tsm or the guard playing hard zone in comp?
[2022-12-17 17:06:26] <+sushischeff> what do we think about Gent as an IGL?
[2022-12-17 17:06:34] <Prodz_z> mid

[2022-12-17 17:07:04] <murray879> Gent is a good igl just a has monkey as a teammate

[2022-12-17 17:10:17] <murray879> How is Zach #5 pred already? Such a underrated beast
[2022-12-17 17:10:18] <+speedyissweaty> I feel like Alb and Snipedown don‚Äôt mix quite yet Slurp is pretty good I feel bad for him some
[2022-12-17 17:10:58] <mikeyclapss> I miss cloud9 üò≠
[2022-12-17 17:11:09] <+KingTrilly> They basically got no practice before the split started. I'm sure FaZe will have a better second split
[2022-12-17 17:11:09] <dxn_scxn> they both dropped down outta nowhere lmaooo
[2022-12-17 17:11:15] <murray879> @mikeyclapss x2
[2022-12-17 17:11:32] <+speedyissweaty> @kingtrilly True I didn‚Äôt realize that fr
[2022-12-17 17:11:53] <+KingTrilly> Plus slurp limited comp experience, hes growing into his roll
[2022-12-17 17:12:06] <+KingTrilly> Split 2 generally teams are more well rounded then the first split
[2022-12-17 17:12:20] <Toysick> Does roller have to be inside bang smoke for their aim assist to not work? or just look towards it
[2022-12-17 17:12:37] <murray879> Slurp has been in the apex game from the start he‚Äôs just dumb
[2022-12-17 17:12:44] <linkastarta> @Toysick target inside or shooter inside, smoke wont work
[2022-12-17 17:12:53] <linkastarta> i mean aim assist

[2022-12-17 17:14:10] <linkastarta> i feel like controller became more meta this season cuz gibby is gone and shotguns are kinda shit

[2022-12-17 17:15:28] <$oPewski> looool
[2022-12-17 17:15:29] <dxn_scxn> dingleberry op
[2022-12-17 17:15:38] <+sushischeff> great mindset lol. I was wondering if you thought she was in the meta rn
[2022-12-17 17:15:41] <smudgypineapple> Yeah you are really good
[2022-12-17 17:15:50] <linkastarta> wraith is now considered support Sadge
[2022-12-17 17:15:52] <Prodz_z> Zach your mic is lower than your teams
[2022-12-17 17:16:04] <+kylesbadhaircut> whats keeping you from reaching the same level with other characters as the support? just time clocked in?
[2022-12-17 17:18:33] <+sushischeff> his willingness to play whatever is str8 passion
[2022-12-17 17:22:11] <+austinweimer1> isn't there no difference between gold R3 and full kitted
[2022-12-17 17:22:20] <+SapsterTV> gold attachments
[2022-12-17 17:22:30] <+SapsterTV> better than purple
[2022-12-17 17:23:32] <Toysick> even barrel?
[2022-12-17 17:23:38] <+SapsterTV> yup
[2022-12-17 17:24:09] <+austinweimer1> I think gold isn't any better than purp it just comes with all attachments
[2022-12-17 17:24:11] <+SapsterTV> stock, mag, barrel, all of them are better when gold
[2022-12-17 17:24:29] <+koolarrowkiller> old school farming
[2022-12-17 17:24:41] <+SapsterTV> wrong, they used to have the gold barrel seasons ago, you could craft it. It was 10% better
[2022-12-17 17:24:43] <alsaidi97> @SapsterTV nah thats not true
[2022-12-17 17:24:57] <+SapsterTV> 100%
[2022-12-17 17:25:08] <+sushischeff> that was the old barrel idk if its like that now

[2022-12-17 17:25:30] <+sushischeff> obvi the mag is the same size it just auto reloads
[2022-12-17 17:25:41] <+SapsterTV> Its a gold attachment, why would it be the same as purple
[2022-12-17 17:25:59] <+SapsterTV> gold barrel has less recoil and the stock has less drift
[2022-12-17 17:26:02] <+SapsterTV> 100%
[2022-12-17 17:27:13] <+austinweimer1> bro its only gold because its fully kitted. the attachments are same as purp
[2022-12-17 17:27:16] <%+PURE_MAPLE_SYRUPP> stream kinda pixelated or just me? could be the 936p
