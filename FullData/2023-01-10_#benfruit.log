[2023-01-10 08:40:59] <%+soxes_> i like these types of servers when im solo and dont have time to "loot up" an adventure server character
[2023-01-10 08:41:05] <%jstChase> I think ATVs are 80k. Then like vanilla vehicles are 100k if I remember correctly. Then armored vehicles go up from 250k.
[2023-01-10 08:41:07] <%Crowley420666> I'm used to severs like DUG, so sometimes its nice to just go be a goon on modded servers like this
[2023-01-10 08:41:15] <StormFodder> it's nice to change it up sometimes
