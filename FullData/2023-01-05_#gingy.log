[2023-01-05 15:07:04] <unrealjacko> @Gingy scav rep sucks this patch, every pscav is killing me every one of my scav runs and it's either I die or kill them and lose rep :(

[2023-01-05 15:08:31] <+mentombeats> Scavs are so OP now
[2023-01-05 15:08:32] <Pyrophoric> Can you just dump all your gear in a bush, and head to extract?

[2023-01-05 15:19:25] <napalot> Orthodox christmas is on January 7th, so it makes sense they take the tree away after that

[2023-01-05 16:57:46] <Drengr_Duck> @epsilon_kitty People cheat for more reasons than RWT; Some people are just trash at a game they like and can't decrease the skill gap. So they resort to that.

[2023-01-05 17:08:46] <+stonepiece0078> Probably an invisible player lurkin lol
[2023-01-05 17:08:51] <%+AJukesProduction> gamer glasses for those that dont wear glasses normally still provide benefit in the form of eye strain relief over long play periods
[2023-01-05 17:08:51] <+timedrone19> @joe_dub Damn, I'm sorry parter
[2023-01-05 17:08:58] <@%IGotBurgerz> @KingBlueJayTV its personal pref

[2023-01-05 17:09:11] <%ObsceneSanity> @KingBlueJayTV i think its just a preference thing. there is no advantage
[2023-01-05 17:09:12] <%$shakinittwice> have to get some wax on them thangs to make them stick

[2023-01-05 17:09:34] <biggj9087> get that ear wax on there to make it grippy
[2023-01-05 17:09:37] <+its_insanity_ttv> They need to conform to your ears. Do they give you different sizes for different ears?
[2023-01-05 17:09:41] <+BST99> earbuds with a mic or a separate mic?
[2023-01-05 17:09:41] <kreepykracker> Only reason I don‚Äôt use earbuds is they make my ears sore after an hour of use. I like my a40s with the sound canceling upgraded pads and mic.
[2023-01-05 17:09:47] <+Lmusoccer18> I just got your streamer item <3

[2023-01-05 17:09:52] <ty3xp> Got loot lord twice in rare drops
[2023-01-05 17:09:57] <%Nykademus> its probably oil from manufacturing the rubber.
[2023-01-05 17:09:58] <%+deepgrok> @Alldoped true...I'm just mean the folks that say IEMs don't stay in their ears.
[2023-01-05 17:10:04] <%Alldoped> @its_insanity_ttv Yea 3 diferent sizes
[2023-01-05 17:10:07] <+DextralisOfficial> you have to wear them in so the ear wax builds up and it sticks NotLikeThis DansGame
[2023-01-05 17:10:13] <+pepkern> @Whippy91 gamer glasses OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 17:10:13] <shuwahhh> there was someone above you

[2023-01-05 17:10:18] <+Soul_Stacker1> probably some lube from manufacturing
[2023-01-05 17:10:20] <+nakedsnake519> I still cant believe landmark uses $3,000 in ear phones.
[2023-01-05 17:10:23] <%LuminousBlue> Are in-ear monitors worth purchasing if you do things other than play sound dependent games like tarkov? I enjoy listening to music and consuming media in my free time, and I feel like in-ears would not be a good idea
[2023-01-05 17:10:25] <StixGevaaalik> @BST99 what do you think that is in front of her face?

[2023-01-05 17:10:38] <+Whippy91> @Whippy91 well what else would you call them? :D
[2023-01-05 17:10:41] <+carbb_> Does anyone know what could be in the legendary loot drop? Watching 10/12 hours is tough lmaoo
[2023-01-05 17:10:42] <scrubLord_val> @nakedsnake519 might as well if he can do it as a business expense
[2023-01-05 17:10:43] <Holy_Phoque> I'm too picky with sound. I can't use anything other than Beyerdynamic or Sennheiser.
[2023-01-05 17:10:45] <+prod1gy42> @Bogguslife What name brand are they?

[2023-01-05 17:11:14] <%+AJukesProduction> in ears are okay for non gaming tasks the only lacking part is low range, they cant create the low range tones as well as over the ear headphones
[2023-01-05 17:11:15] <+plaptt> monkaW
[2023-01-05 17:11:19] <mojonbrownn> do u have binaural on or off?

[2023-01-05 17:11:40] <Micholous> @kbishop1  if u find a decent fitting earbuds they wont hurt :P but tbh hard find, it took me so long...
[2023-01-05 17:11:44] <+pepkern> @Whippy91 @Whippy91 it's just a ridiculously dumb concept. it does nothing for you. just install f.lux or iris if you want less blue light

[2023-01-05 17:12:10] <+gluten_free_water> @AJukesProduction there are some iem's that get close, but ultimately there is physics with the driver size

[2023-01-05 17:12:26] <arrhythmia1017> @LuminousBlue if youre using iems for just casual music and gaming then no. Hundreds if not thousands of dollars IEMS are not worth it. Also IEMS should not cost more than the PC your gaming on
[2023-01-05 17:12:26] <%+MajorPainCA> Bounced inside then outside the fence?
[2023-01-05 17:12:26] <B_o_m_m_e_l> sounds are brocken

[2023-01-05 17:16:15] <+Mumfizlaw> @straightboolin675 because they are out for barters
[2023-01-05 17:16:18] <+gluten_free_water> @AJukesProduction solid pair. Closed backs get a bit hot for me, but beyerdynamic makes great imaging sets

[2023-01-05 17:16:56] <RyseUpGaming> also chat, audio can differ from person to person, when it come to frequency, tonality, etc. so what works for one person may not work for another. ive used so many headphones and iems that i cant remember how many ive acutally tried. but audio in general is broken right now.
[2023-01-05 17:17:02] <+DextralisOfficial> @straightboolin675 delete all the filters at the top, maybe there are only barter offers, which by default are not shown

[2023-01-05 17:19:06] <BorisandrZakidonski> @Gingy is the surface of the earbuds coated in Unobtainium? It's a material that grips better when in contact with sweat (my Oakley sunglasses for beach volleyball have that on the earsocks and the nosepad, so they never fall off).

[2023-01-05 17:37:14] <3arendel> lots of people talking about how the scavs are ruthless, have yet to die from them this wipe

[2023-01-05 17:37:17] <IconconI> @kingof_things i highly recommend doing scav raids in between all of your pmc raids
[2023-01-05 17:37:27] <%+Brootzz> @Skrylog im sure there's a guide on youtube
[2023-01-05 17:37:27] <pixzrr> Mule or SJ

[2023-01-05 17:37:32] <epsilon_kitty> @kingof_things What you can do is roll the free kit you get on a scav into your pmc raids. Your gun my jam sometimes, but it's free!
[2023-01-05 17:37:35] <%+AJukesProduction> @kingof_things You can either play the actual raid or go straight to extract and use the equipment on your pmc

[2023-01-05 17:37:47] <thatguyimpulse> @3arendel Its because people have shit armor and bad weapons, they always feel OP at the start of a wipe, every wipe.
[2023-01-05 17:37:47] <Tairy_Hestical> Scavs are absolutely cracked this wipe.
[2023-01-05 17:37:47] <filet_st_eak> sj6 enjoyer peepoRun

[2023-01-05 17:37:52] <+Ace_D_Firefist> audio is straight up busted
[2023-01-05 17:37:57] <Skrylog> @Brootzz nothing on youtube
[2023-01-05 17:38:18] <3arendel> @thatguyimpulse that's probably it

[2023-01-05 17:38:23] <Canyew29> @ItzCarSalesman I had to turn the new audio setting off because it was eating my FPS from some weird reason
[2023-01-05 17:38:24] <espen1020> hbd gingy!
[2023-01-05 17:38:25] <goldendragon11> something wrong w adar?
[2023-01-05 17:38:30] <allbeeeee> @3arendel nah, this early wipe they have headshotted me more than the entire previous wipe
[2023-01-05 17:38:34] <ThePibbster> @Tairy_Hestical  don't hard peak them anymore, hide behind cover and do a covert movement to reset scav aggro
[2023-01-05 17:38:36] <xRedRamx> i don't feel like scavs are bad at all this wipe
[2023-01-05 17:38:38] <Reinhardz7> @Gingy are u playing with binaural sound?
[2023-01-05 17:38:43] <Tairy_Hestical> Not true, I wear good armor most raids and get messed up by scavs all the time
[2023-01-05 17:38:43] VIEWERS: 24¬†115
[2023-01-05 17:38:48] <NotFaintNebula> @Ace_D_Firefist Disable binaural it makes it better
[2023-01-05 17:38:51] <%+Brootzz> @Skrylog :( - all i know is if you do it too much you get loads of debuffs, just need to work out where the 'line' is. I'm not a chad like you and havent unlocked it yet xD
[2023-01-05 17:38:56] <+Eight_Core> same
[2023-01-05 17:38:59] <thatguyimpulse> @3arendel You're hard peaking for sure.
[2023-01-05 17:39:06] <%+Vysterion> hey look, it's the heli you need the marker for LUL
[2023-01-05 17:39:07] <SadgeandMadge> I tried binaural off but i think it makes the audio even worse
[2023-01-05 17:39:08] <+nakedsnake519> @xRedRamx Then you clearly dont try to get tasks done on woods.
[2023-01-05 17:39:09] <+cretgar_> my ping is 6 at server selection page but 120-130 in game and its laggy. It wasnt like that BibleThump
[2023-01-05 17:39:11] <lancedesi> bruh get in that helicopter and fly away
[2023-01-05 17:39:11] <$TheShootyLoots> Veritas just put out a vid on the oculus audio. tl;dr binaural doesnt seem to do anything and it's hard to tell the diff between front, back, above, and below
[2023-01-05 17:39:12] <pixzrr> Binaural no good anwwaya
[2023-01-05 17:39:13] <%tbonesk> @Reinhardz7 no
[2023-01-05 17:39:14] <trippyblueberrypie> how does an audio option drop frames though? haha i dont use it either cause it kept echoing but yeah
[2023-01-05 17:39:17] <%+AJukesProduction> @Gingy Sounds like you may need to update the drivers/software for your audio interface
[2023-01-05 17:39:17] <%+JdashStan> Veritas just dropped a good video explain it doesn't even work right now anyway
[2023-01-05 17:39:23] <3arendel> @allbeeeee In truth I've only done 15 runs or so. May have been lucky
[2023-01-05 17:39:23] <friskolino> Veritas confirmed today to turn it off and if we should trust anyone regarding audio it's Veritas.
[2023-01-05 17:39:23] <cubolt> Any tips on if game keeps crashing on raid?
[2023-01-05 17:39:25] <+noonifer> Happy Birthday!
[2023-01-05 17:39:29] <ThePibbster> If you hard peak scavs they will shit on you, like they are supposed to. don't hard peak. lol wuht
[2023-01-05 17:39:31] <+kaali87> how does audio effect frames? (genuine question)
[2023-01-05 17:39:31] <+Eight_Core> and massive frame drops
[2023-01-05 17:39:32] <kreepykracker> Binaural audio is broken anyway
[2023-01-05 17:39:36] <Tairy_Hestical> Never hard peak or left peak.
[2023-01-05 17:39:38] <SadgeandMadge> @trippyblueberrypie extra audio processing
[2023-01-05 17:39:39] <mojonbrownn> get morer ram
[2023-01-05 17:39:42] <Swiftindex> Binaural doesn't do anything anyways so you should def leave itt off for now
[2023-01-05 17:39:47] <%+AJukesProduction> @kaali87 Proccessing issues
[2023-01-05 17:39:47] <+4enzic> Happy birthday! @gingy
[2023-01-05 17:39:48] <$TheShootyLoots> @trippyblueberrypie additional processing probably related to the fact it's not implemented correctly
[2023-01-05 17:39:49] <+sc00ob> aim this wipe is to get to elite scav in less than 1k runs. prefer the randomness of it all just wish i could drop in at start of the raid. they should make that an option.
[2023-01-05 17:39:51] <%samuelb00> @gingy can you sneak this wipe? i'm so loud even at 0 speed
[2023-01-05 17:39:58] <+atrocitymf> @kaali87 memory leaks

[2023-01-05 17:40:05] <Canyew29> @trippyblueberrypie On streets of tarkov, with the new audio on. I was getting like 20 FPS with it off I was getting about 45. I REALLY don't get it
[2023-01-05 17:40:08] <+kaali87> @AJukesProduction ah ok thanks
[2023-01-05 17:40:14] <sgtepicfail> Shouldn't you be careful because its a clear night and vision isn't actually that bad?
[2023-01-05 17:40:16] <+operatorpronto> Sound is soooo buggy
[2023-01-05 17:40:18] <doorphin> as far as i understand it the binaural sound only works on streets so far
[2023-01-05 17:40:20] <Cosmoscowboy13> was the creep sound changed this wipe or last?
[2023-01-05 17:40:21] <+socksthc> same

[2023-01-05 17:41:14] <ThePibbster> There's no barriers for sound anymore so sound travels through walls the same as open space. just a product of the new audio
[2023-01-05 17:41:18] <Majinbrew> @samuelb00 need to level up to be more quiet
[2023-01-05 17:41:25] <archexxe> @energeh Install some form of spatial audio - DTS, DTX, SteelSeries Sonar

[2023-01-05 17:41:30] <+Brainscatterz> @3arendel i feel like scavs are busted too especially sniper scavs last wipe they barely hit me at all and now they just insta headshot me everytime lol
[2023-01-05 17:41:31] <+KirkyTurk3y> I think it's okay with the weight system. it should be loud right after wipe.
[2023-01-05 17:41:33] <+xstoney96> So it‚Äôs true you can‚Äôt craft ledex anymore?
[2023-01-05 17:41:38] <%samuelb00> yeah thats new iguess

[2023-01-05 17:43:07] <sgtepicfail> i am so used to shit frames with my 980 that i think i will perform way worse with like 60+ fps..
[2023-01-05 17:43:11] <pixzrr> 1080 to 1440 is that a graphics card thing or monitor thing
[2023-01-05 17:43:12] <%$shakinittwice> Yeah I hate they took that out

[2023-01-05 17:43:16] <slabdabchad> i like it like this. that was a bug lol
[2023-01-05 17:43:17] <%+ModestWreck> Agreed
[2023-01-05 17:43:19] <Canyew29> I don't get why they removed that
[2023-01-05 17:43:19] <DMG420_Tv> yea i wish they left boxes opened
[2023-01-05 17:43:20] <+muxsey_> ++++++
[2023-01-05 17:43:25] <Hexagull> @pixzrr both
[2023-01-05 17:43:29] <xRedRamx> wait, so you need to transfer loot into your bag/rig and then drop it? that helps with skills?
[2023-01-05 17:43:31] <ThePibbster> they removed that this wipe, it was never supposed to be that way apparently it was a bug. i liked it the old way better also.
[2023-01-05 17:43:32] <+chiefbeef65> @Steven_Butabi make sure your ram is  clocked at the right speed i checked mine and was way under performing changed that and went up to min 90 on every map
[2023-01-05 17:43:32] <originsog_> the patch notes said it was a bug
[2023-01-05 17:43:32] <Majinbrew> did you guys optimize your Nvidia settings? if not that will boost you like 10-20 fps
[2023-01-05 17:43:33] <%+dinodarb> @sgtepicfail im on a 970. i feel ya
[2023-01-05 17:43:35] <ARareEntei> That would be a cool way for a skillcheck, to see if its looted or not
[2023-01-05 17:43:37] <+taltonis> ye i like it
[2023-01-05 17:43:37] <famous_1907> mmm
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <Weberling1709_> yes
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <+cockjab> i started looting everything i see this wipe and got marauder class instead of neutralizer
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <%RyseUpGaming> @pixzrr that s resolution difference
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <AValkyrus> it slows down looting
[2023-01-05 17:43:42] <%+HongDaii> sadly yes
[2023-01-05 17:43:42] <+FreakVelocity> yeah it was a bug, they never used to stay open like that
[2023-01-05 17:43:43] <MCStoneZ> yeah
[2023-01-05 17:43:43] <%+Alteroc> Yeah, according to patch notes it was a bug
[2023-01-05 17:43:45] <%$shakinittwice> yup
[2023-01-05 17:43:46] <+tangosox> i cant play at less than 1440p and for tarkov i think even 4k would be helpful
[2023-01-05 17:43:46] <DuncasaurW> as long as it's consistent, as it showed closed if you searched it, open if someone else did
[2023-01-05 17:43:46] <+Toka_mac> yea that was never intended
[2023-01-05 17:43:48] <1337_potatoe> They said it was a FIX, and they fixed containers openned after someone openned them, what a bunch of idiots
[2023-01-05 17:43:49] <SadgeandMadge> @pixzrr monitor resolution not graphics cards
[2023-01-05 17:43:51] <+dynamoDes> It's low-key a nice way to slow raids down a touch. People spending an extra few minutes to check extra containers
[2023-01-05 17:43:54] <+Bogguslife> you should have to manually close things after you are done with them at the very least.
[2023-01-05 17:43:54] <pixzrr> @hexagull so can I run a 1440 on a lower end graphics card?
[2023-01-05 17:43:54] <+Theos75> @Gingy why do you have a vudu in your gamma
[2023-01-05 17:43:59] <+NightLander> It was a feature for me
[2023-01-05 17:44:00] <+Truki> 4 years old bug Pepega
[2023-01-05 17:44:02] <ThePibbster> mhm mhm
[2023-01-05 17:44:02] <+CarbonRP> Stuff opened should stay open, unless you physically close it
[2023-01-05 17:44:04] <+gotler> container was closed for you, but open for everyone else
[2023-01-05 17:44:06] <%MikeWilliams1990> I‚Äôve found several containers that are still open though after looting
[2023-01-05 17:44:06] <%Carrionx> HAPPY BIRTHDAY
[2023-01-05 17:44:08] <+taltonis> he always said it way, why cant you close boxes?
[2023-01-05 17:44:12] <semistupidd> @pixzrr no
[2023-01-05 17:44:14] <+Kr3stus> 100% agree with you its dumb...
[2023-01-05 17:44:14] <+Steven_Butabi> @chiefbeef65 i have an older machine, its about 5 years now. i just need to bite the bullet and get a new build started
[2023-01-05 17:44:15] <Weberling1709_> you hear every thing closing after looting
[2023-01-05 17:44:18] <$billyhates> If they leave it open maybe
[2023-01-05 17:44:18] <+Toka_mac> everyone got too used to the sauce

[2023-01-05 17:44:23] <%Alldoped> But how would u konw how it looked ? before since u werent there before
[2023-01-05 17:44:24] <1337_potatoe> Yeah the patch notes said they "Fixed it" dumbass shit I ever read
[2023-01-05 17:44:24] <%+JewsNBooze> But whenever you open a container, it stays closed on your client side after you close it
[2023-01-05 17:44:25] <PistolPeteHogan> The problem was that it was desynced. On your side it would look closed but on another players side it would look open
[2023-01-05 17:44:27] <goldendragon11> huh
[2023-01-05 17:44:30] <$TheShootyLoots> From Notes: "Fixed an issue where already looted containers were left open to other players;"
[2023-01-05 17:44:30] <+FreakVelocity> I mean, I feel like someone smart would close a container behind them to cover tracks right? Especially if they knew hostiles were in the area.
[2023-01-05 17:44:35] <%$shakinittwice> @Theos75 for the same reason she doesn't have markers
[2023-01-05 17:44:36] <ThePibbster> Would be a nice thing to gain as your perception levels up, so you can tell someone has been there. That would be a good compromise.
[2023-01-05 17:44:44] <ckviper> Yeah your PMC always closes the container before leaving.  It was a bug that it was left open for others.
[2023-01-05 17:44:44] <%RyseUpGaming> @Gingy what monitor do you have currently if you dont mind me asking
[2023-01-05 17:44:44] <Sniffum_San> Well how do you know if something has been searched if youve never been there? I think i their idea

[2023-01-05 17:45:55] <Canyew29> Yet BSG can't fix the airdrop dysnc with scavs. Aka if you load into a map. And an airdrop is on the way. When it lands you cant access it. If you load just before the airdrop spawns. you can acess it

[2023-01-05 17:48:07] <cheat117> actual reality: streaming is more difficult than construction and remember that it seems easy, find the energy to talk about the same topic every hour for 3 hours and then dealing with more abuse than a starbucks employees.
[2023-01-05 17:48:11] <%+rustywallac3> @JewsNBooze yupp ebay for me too

[2023-01-05 17:48:16] <%ObsceneSanity> 64k partners on twitch, only a small percentage of them make a living wage off content creation on twitch alone. just be aware of what you can and cannot do
[2023-01-05 17:48:17] <%Alldoped> @CandiSpirit There are like A LOT of people that never get 1 viewer so 2 is fair but like the top is hard to reach :D

[2023-01-05 17:49:49] <+Athasin> You can just look at any Twitch chart to see most viewed streamer and that list is full of dudes
[2023-01-05 17:49:50] <Exalah> the top 100 streamers on twitch are all men except i think amoranth just got into the top 100 LUL
[2023-01-05 17:49:50] <+ZomBeastMode> was like 1 women in the top 50 on Twitch...not enough

[2023-01-05 17:50:03] <bawksmydad> if you had someone like XQC + someone like Mizkif online at the same time, theyd easily trump the top 10 female streamers alone just them two
[2023-01-05 17:50:03] <+cuppakoopa> ok chat way to move the goal posts after getting owned

[2023-01-05 17:52:47] <kcajjj> I think what they mean is that for a male to gain views that they have to be good at the game, and not their content, rather with women they can be worse at the game and still pull the same views

[2023-01-05 17:57:47] <Tigergutt9> @phiskas depends on resolution how much a 4090 will benefit frames,  and ofc what is currently used

[2023-01-05 18:05:31] <Keysane> they could yes, but they just prove it after
[2023-01-05 18:05:31] <LootPeasant> ive seen it happen on youtube
[2023-01-05 18:05:32] <%Jimbo_BP> I think you should cover each song in your playlist, and have those songs as the background music ginger4Ihack
[2023-01-05 18:05:32] <Pheonixinflames> Herman Li has been previously
[2023-01-05 18:05:33] <+southpawlul> happened to logic the rapper
[2023-01-05 18:05:33] <%goldenknight22> depends who owns the rights
[2023-01-05 18:05:33] <+mcsouthstar> yes because they give up the rights to others
[2023-01-05 18:05:33] <DemonsDismayGaming> Yes
[2023-01-05 18:05:33] <+Whoracle1337> Herman Li got banned from Twitch because of playing his song
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <%RyseUpGaming> i think its happened lol
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <+Pyro_92> If they dont have permission from teh record label yea
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <Warnoq> yes, its happened
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <Ric34v6> it has lol
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <%+Deyy_> yes it happened to logic when he streamed his album
[2023-01-05 18:05:34] <idunoe> it has happened KEKW
[2023-01-05 18:05:36] <+gluten_free_water> Yes. Many artists do not own their music
[2023-01-05 18:05:36] <SilentService12> didnt tpain get that
[2023-01-05 18:05:38] <FunghamentalistTV> yeah stupid rules
[2023-01-05 18:05:40] <Majinbrew> depends on the record company
[2023-01-05 18:05:44] <%+AJukesProduction> It would depend on the copyright ownership of the song
[2023-01-05 18:05:44] <+bodphrah> That happened to herman lee
[2023-01-05 18:05:44] <+s_i_n_c_e_r_e> Dual what audio
[2023-01-05 18:05:44] <RuschiLive> yes if the rights are bought by a company
[2023-01-05 18:05:44] <%CLS2145> @Gingy knows everyone. First Katy Perry's family, and now Chris from MIW XD But that's pretty dope
[2023-01-05 18:05:46] <TheIndieDetective> If they have a record label that owns the broadcast rights, yes, they can get DMCA'd
[2023-01-05 18:05:47] <Krisbow> JohnB said it happened to him a couple of times I believe
[2023-01-05 18:05:51] <%skymill220> i know a streamer who makes music and he cant even play his music
[2023-01-05 18:05:53] <+6Sour> yes, illenium said he cant stream his own music bc the label owns it
[2023-01-05 18:05:54] <$Rutgrr> cuz techincally its not their song :D
[2023-01-05 18:05:56] <elforthefirst> if the record label owns it yep
[2023-01-05 18:05:56] <!%MeowMeinStreams> the record labels own the music its not until very recently that artists have been taking more control with the distribution of music through spotify
[2023-01-05 18:05:56] <attackthedarkness> i've seen it happen to a music streamer, his label hit his own channel

[2023-01-05 18:06:14] <!%MeowMeinStreams> the music industry is VERY predatory
[2023-01-05 18:06:17] <%Universalsoul> a lot of bands have no say, labels own the rights a lot of the time unfortunately
[2023-01-05 18:06:20] <@%IGotBurgerz> Its called "TWITCH VOD TRACK" in OBS
[2023-01-05 18:06:23] <+Ace_D_Firefist> @TinbalPlays they deserved it

[2023-01-05 18:06:27] <cheat117> @Gingy DMCA is technically just a process; The owners of the masters/rights are the ones who ultimately can issue/revoke. HOWEVER, after the destiny 2 DMCA strikes from last year, we've learned how easy it is to just do it willynilly.
[2023-01-05 18:06:29] <MOneyJuiceDaddy> I mean Twitch had to mute their own streams to not get DMCA'd by Metallica even though they hired them
[2023-01-05 18:06:34] <lNimmyl> Hello @Gingy

[2023-01-05 18:14:33] <EatinGamez> you can stack plants like that?
[2023-01-05 18:14:33] <Shadow_Slayer> It‚Äôs one account per purchase, and progression/equipment etc is tied to the account. Your friend can physically play the game on your PC without purchasing, however they must purchase their own account if they are to have their own character and progression, as we do not yet have multiple characters   IIRC account sharing is against ToS so please do not attempt to use the same account on 2 PCs

[2023-01-05 18:22:39] <+idkwtfisthisshiz> a-daaar is how it should be I think
[2023-01-05 18:22:49] <@%+jimmiedrum> it'll go away around the 7th or 8th prolly @lep_few

[2023-01-05 18:37:31] <%iiamwolf> any "office" area in your home can be considered a tax write off. They encouraged us to do so when my wife worked as a contractor.

[2023-01-05 18:37:32] <Oddside> I use my 45k vehicle to drive to my job. So with that logic it's a tax write off

[2023-01-05 18:38:43] <sharktooth1414> they don't want people know how to use money because it would take money from the banks and government
[2023-01-05 18:38:47] <hdog8930103> If it's for your job it can be a tax write off
[2023-01-05 18:38:47] <PopOnLock> Why are they even asking these questions here... lol... Ask google... it says I'm a French Model

[2023-01-05 18:38:55] <SstearnZy> you need to have enough write offs to get past the standard deduction for write offs to even be bennificial

[2023-01-05 20:29:45] <%$AngryVetGaming> to get streamer items you have to be a "non name bi*ch"
[2023-01-05 20:29:49] <%+shakinittwice> @eternal_krieger Already takes the average person 2-3 weeks to get decent gear for each raid. If it was harder to do that a HUGE portion of the player base would leave and not come back

[2023-01-05 20:38:17] <+Antifather> ppl seem to forget the main aim of the game is just getting out with your life and atleast a bit of loot
[2023-01-05 20:38:18] <Phoboshs> or play slow, do quests in last 20 min of raid
[2023-01-05 20:38:20] <+sespaagriIlen> Use scavs runs to learn maps aswell, or even do offline raids
[2023-01-05 20:38:23] <%+mcwillyy29> Yeah best advice is to just play and get over the gear fear and what now
[2023-01-05 20:38:24] <%blackacres> shoreline is gamerville atm, even at night
[2023-01-05 20:38:25] <Hazasoul> game seems interesting, but i don't yet understand the objective, is it like a looter shooter?

[2023-01-05 22:11:11] <Dolac84> @Gingy Sharptooth has been testing out the frames problem, whats going on is the server region selection is ignoring your region, and for some reason putting people on distant servers, and due to the data that needs to send and receive for the new audio it drops frames... he selects North America South East and was getting midwest, westcoast and north west canada servers, he checked the logs, blocked those server IP's and it would STILL try to connect to them in the game
