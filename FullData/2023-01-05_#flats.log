[2023-01-05 16:52:51] <TheClickNick> @flats do you think the ranked system needs a change for abandoning teammates. I went from d2 solo q support and had 4 games IN A ROW where a teammate leaves winnable games. And then I ranked down all the way to d5. Seems like every other comp game I play only penalizes the leaving player…

[2023-01-05 17:03:16] <WorshipSeitan> @Docspaz You don't even need to mention play time if you're actually concerned. But if you were to look at mine I have 200+ hours on Rein, but it's Junker Queen out of all characters I've been getting good at last time. Can Orisa and sometimes Rein. But don't tell me a person has to play their most played, it was long ago for so many of us

[2023-01-05 18:19:13] <%thehokeypogi> @flats how did your sleep study go?
[2023-01-05 18:19:15] <%$sofishdekat> !thetok
[2023-01-05 18:19:22] <Yukii_mei> @phook_mii on average those that run their mouths are compensating and not able to pass judgment on themselves nor tak responsibility. Doing so is more difficult since it acknowledges a learning experience and curve. Forget the study but a group of players was tested and it found more low tier players would blame teammates for mistakes while higher skilled recognized them and was less likely to blame/trash.

[2023-01-05 18:27:37] <+driftyboi13> @jryderaz I think qp is the best place to learn your character. Flats has said that qp will teach you how to play them, where you can get good at them, then you go into comp to see how you can apply it to the meta

[2023-01-05 18:30:11] <keyofsmosh1> @driftyboi13 yea 100 hours is overkill i put like 5 hours of kiriko in qp play before  starting to play her in ranked now shes my best support i think comp is the best place to truly learn how a hero is played
[2023-01-05 18:30:14] <+turnwagon> does the game track QP hours?
[2023-01-05 18:30:17] <+driftyboi13> @jryderaz I don’t think that there should be a set amount of time you play a character before you can play them in comp. Like, just have fun

[2023-01-05 18:31:27] <%+x_zellex_x> Overall
[2023-01-05 18:31:27] <%+kojiyomi> @driftyboi13 100 hours is ridiculous, you could learn and play a character effectively in less than 20. You just need to watch others play, learn movement and ability cooldowns if you want to "play good" in comp but there's no point in waiting if it keeps you from counter picking the enemy
[2023-01-05 18:31:32] <+turnwagon> junk moment

[2023-01-05 18:34:05] <%digitalhadoken1> @buggywag same concept you want to take as much as possible without dying
[2023-01-05 18:34:06] <TheCerri> @buggywag depends on the hero you're playing but basically position like they'll die in an instant

[2023-01-05 18:36:07] <SqueakyStreamer> Aaron Keller posted an update on Twitter just now: “Today’s balance patch is a bit lighter than usual because some of its planned changes were pulled forward to the mid December patch. Also, a friendly reminder that the scheduled changes to Roadhog are not part of today’s patch and are slated for mid to late January.”

[2023-01-05 18:40:36] <+khota123> @buggywag Definitely kills. You can get 10,000 damage by just shooting at the tank but if you don't kill anyone they just take all the space and ultimately win the fight
[2023-01-05 18:40:40] <VikingKong_> just you :) @WellbeWelloff

[2023-01-05 18:40:43] <kamis120> @buggywag well if you do damage but no one dies, then it’s pointless. Kills matter more but it depends if they’re good pick.

[2023-01-05 18:42:08] <%$jasonwocky> some patch news on Twitter from Keller: Today's balance patch is a bit lighter than usual because some of its planned changes were pulled forward to the mid December patch. Also, a friendly reminder that the scheduled changes to Roadhog are not part of today’s patch and are slated for mid to late January.

[2023-01-05 18:55:23] <%SkitzoCTRL> @jasonwocky I think that one-shots are fine when they are both skill intensive and have a way to play around them. I wouldn't mind Hog's one-shot if it required a really good right click, hook, left click, and melee.

[2023-01-05 19:01:41] <striven9000> @SkitzoCTRL yes, however when the tank overextends its still extremely difficult to kill her with the mega heals and is overwatch 2 just avoid the tank at all costs seems weird

[2023-01-05 19:02:30] <%Andy0urlittledog> @SkitzoCTRL Tough thing with mercy is that her damage boost offsets her little to no damage potential.
[2023-01-05 19:02:30] <%bidooofer> @somecypr3ss weird to point that outn
[2023-01-05 19:02:32] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Andy0urlittledog The biggest thing is tanks doing too much damage, honestly. Almost every game I play, I see the tank(s) being top damage, usually because they're just dueling each other.

[2023-01-05 19:06:47] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2023-01-05 19:24:00] <%Andy0urlittledog> @bogur I know you arent asking me but ill reply anyway. I think if the skins were like 50 to 60% cheaper i would probably buy them. Maybe try to nerf hogs dmg at first to see how it goes
[2023-01-05 19:24:02] <%+Oh_its_deez> Is this the update where queen is supposed to receive an update?

[2023-01-05 19:24:05] <couchbard> even if the rework isnt ready hog needs to be changed in the meantime

[2023-01-05 20:42:12] <%+number0nechatter> what if you hit 5 Aware
[2023-01-05 20:42:16] <+driftyboi13> Not instant, it’s bleed

[2023-01-05 20:42:20] <malmal46> it's if they die with the bleed
[2023-01-05 20:42:22] <+Cosmic_Jok3r> @Flats hit the moniters with the axe it reduces the cooldown
[2023-01-05 20:42:22] <%+jodrajoko> its for all healing

[2023-01-05 20:42:32] <%ericcartman0076> JQ with brig could be really good now
[2023-01-05 20:42:32] <+forbiddendessert> apparently it works other objects too such as turrets
[2023-01-05 20:42:32] <%+aaymon86> You get 30 more bleed healing
[2023-01-05 20:42:32] <boldfacedprune> instant
[2023-01-05 20:42:33] <+ChidoriiChan> @Flats Ult through choke+Axe+Axe again
[2023-01-05 20:42:33] <+driftyboi13> Bleed means it’s not instant
[2023-01-05 20:42:34] <old_toby42069> Nice, she needs a bit more of that self-sustain
[2023-01-05 20:42:39] <JCasper> Wait are changes already out?
[2023-01-05 20:42:41] <%$jasonwocky> does the direct stack with the return?
[2023-01-05 20:42:42] <%+aaymon86> Not sure the calculations on that.
[2023-01-05 20:42:44] <+blazgreen42O> @Flats the cooldown decrease works on destructible environments apparently
[2023-01-05 20:42:46] <%ponez> its from ALL bleeds tho
[2023-01-05 20:42:50] <%EmpoweredWhiskey> love how tanks get those mega biffs n nerfs meanwhile supports get 5 more bullets, 50 more shield n a kittle orb regen XD.  oh boy
[2023-01-05 20:42:50] <%+Lexyz> Does the healing work when the axe kills something?
[2023-01-05 20:42:52] <vergil_hc> @ericcartman0076 i said that in december allready. Queen+brig might become meta ^^
[2023-01-05 20:42:54] <%$jasonwocky> do they get 2 wounds now? one on hit and one on return?
[2023-01-05 20:42:54] <$MistahBread_doe> so that increased wound healing from the season 2 patch is better now
[2023-01-05 20:42:56] <Kevo149> they need to revert her hitbox tho
[2023-01-05 20:42:56] <%Deadtift> @Flats i think i found a bug in the olimpus challenges. The "win 10 battles" give me a 1 even if i didn't won. Try to check if for you is the same
[2023-01-05 20:42:58] <%+ALiveCardinal> So like if you bleed someone and widow one shots them you heal around 150

[2023-01-05 20:44:35] <%MCDraws_> Cheer300 The Junkerqueen decrease cooldown thing also works on destructible things like railings monkaS

[2023-01-05 20:44:46] <FaIgarth> Lucio is also insane
[2023-01-05 20:44:48] <midnightmuffin12> it would be cool to ask everyone to do it all with only Rein

[2023-01-05 20:45:01] <weboremerald> what do you think about ctf in comp?
[2023-01-05 20:45:04] <%$XanisG> I'm beginning to think there isn't a single person on the OW team that knows how to play Rein judging by the constant non-buffs.
[2023-01-05 20:45:04] <%thelatinochild> @MCDraws_ WHAT
[2023-01-05 20:45:05] <%MCDraws_> @f1_voidz yea...

[2023-01-05 20:45:57] <+MeatKermit69420> they know queen is gonna win thats why her statue is already there

[2023-01-05 20:46:22] <RGS_9> Carnage is the same cooldown at 8 seconds

[2023-01-05 20:54:12] <%butt_poop_> Lucio is MVP of the new mode
[2023-01-05 20:54:15] <%+williedustice22> this game mode is pretty not good
[2023-01-05 20:54:17] <ItsDusto> lucio is so goo in this gamemode if you can play him well regularly
[2023-01-05 20:54:19] <Reapii666> Oh it's Muma again KEKW
[2023-01-05 20:54:20] <%butt_poop_> very fun and has a stun
[2023-01-05 20:54:20] <TxMamaGaming> Have you seen the video about the Medusa skin being 'pay to lose' because of the constant snake sound? Enemies can hear it, and you can't hear footsteps easily.
[2023-01-05 20:54:20] <gallrox> widow is suffering in this gamemode
[2023-01-05 20:54:21] <SL_Nerf_Herder> i would look at that medusa Kreygasm
[2023-01-05 20:54:22] <%kettlerskyy> widow on petra is pretty bad
[2023-01-05 20:54:23] <masqru> !patch
[2023-01-05 20:54:24] <@%^StreamElements> New balance patch is out NOW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W3MO9tS938
[2023-01-05 20:54:25] <monasster> widow only good vs phraha, lucio and widows. cant 1shot tanks
[2023-01-05 20:54:26] <sonic__ow> they better add those sfx effects from jq in this game mode to her ACTUAL MYTHIC
[2023-01-05 20:54:29] <%northnana> bad map for widow
[2023-01-05 20:54:33] <lonely_blade> no genji nerfs? no way
[2023-01-05 20:54:35] <+pinklemo> The game mode is just death match?
[2023-01-05 20:54:35] <%butt_poop_> He has a stun now
[2023-01-05 20:54:36] <%uhMatcha> widow sounds miserable KEKW
[2023-01-05 20:54:39] <NuDimon> @miiistercarr minor tweaks and the event, there's a bigger balance patch in a few weeks
[2023-01-05 20:54:42] <+dream_nicely> he doesn't self heal
[2023-01-05 20:54:43] <%paleassnowx> nah they gave him stun. 3 game won as lucio so far
[2023-01-05 20:54:44] <normammuu> wall stun is nuts
[2023-01-05 20:54:46] <%MookyNinja> lucio is just that bol
[2023-01-05 20:54:46] <%a_witcher> he just can get in fast and steal kills
[2023-01-05 20:54:51] <%Stonks368> Also infinite ammo is pretty good
[2023-01-05 20:54:51] <ChronoAura> Widow got no self healing
[2023-01-05 20:54:54] <+SteadySwerve_> widow aint built for this gamemode
[2023-01-05 20:54:58] <%kettlerskyy> widow needs less cooldowns on this mode
[2023-01-05 20:54:59] <+aj7continue> they put tanks vs support and dps and think it's a good idea
[2023-01-05 20:55:01] <%+Quizzystyle> just placed nr one with jq :D
[2023-01-05 20:55:01] <Dirty_Bonnie> I think widow is so good in this gamemode, right guys? yea no
[2023-01-05 20:55:02] <slideeda> fr
[2023-01-05 20:55:02] <The_Zoozibble> feels like widows only good with her new ult
[2023-01-05 20:55:03] <+M2GAMER10> Dude this chat looks like a copypasta thread today. seagDUMP dattoY
[2023-01-05 20:55:08] <AureliusGold> <3
[2023-01-05 20:55:08] <+0HudMan> ion think widow gonna be that good w so many tanks tbh
[2023-01-05 20:55:10] <%+ikelos101> rein is really good depending on map
[2023-01-05 20:55:10] <onlyvillanelle> flatsPog
[2023-01-05 20:55:10] <oztw> @lyradx the mode is mainly for people to play with the new shop skins for a limited time and decide if they want to unlock them peremently
[2023-01-05 20:55:13] <%+Quizzystyle> she ios pretty good
[2023-01-05 20:55:14] <%$ChatoGuy1> heals, speed, normal boop + further boop with ult, boop into wall stuns, ult gives nano + extra health
[2023-01-05 20:55:14] <%+pandacow5> you apparently can't hear footprints with her new skin, and apparently, you can hear the snakes on her hair as well. making it easier to hear her. lol pay to lose skin.
[2023-01-05 20:55:18] <Reapii666> Widow seems really annoying to just play ass
[2023-01-05 20:55:18] <+MrSuperfreak> Widow seems kinda shit? lol
[2023-01-05 20:55:19] <onlyvillanelle> flatsKEK
[2023-01-05 20:55:21] <Dizzydiz1098> how are widows cool downs still the same lol
[2023-01-05 20:55:22] <Cheetah_ft> this is ass
[2023-01-05 20:55:25] <tetro_hexual> lucio has like a super boop after beating
[2023-01-05 20:55:26] <mrwang30> COPIUM
[2023-01-05 20:55:27] <Raepopsicles> What a fucking joke of an event this is, haha.
[2023-01-05 20:55:27] <%+Quizzystyle> i bet there will be no widow statue :P
[2023-01-05 20:55:31] <riceyballxz> this patch was mid
[2023-01-05 20:55:32] <%+jodrajoko> Yeah all the fun is in the ultimates
[2023-01-05 20:55:34] <%TheEmptySkys1> The tanks make it pretty rough
[2023-01-05 20:55:35] <tetro_hexual> and he does a fuck ton more dmg
[2023-01-05 20:55:37] <%daviddd12312345> this is the new event? LOL
[2023-01-05 20:55:40] <%expn0ob> yeah...I don't think widows gonna get that statue...
[2023-01-05 20:55:41] <ChronoAura> This isn't a good map for Widow, unless you play on the cliff.

[2023-01-05 20:55:45] <just_m95> ramattra maybe ? @Flats
[2023-01-05 20:55:45] <%+jodrajoko> until then its just deathmatch
[2023-01-05 20:55:46] <+cl0ud_dealer> What is a widow supposed to do here versus tanks?\
[2023-01-05 20:55:47] <Hoodkaneki> surprised at no hog change today
[2023-01-05 20:55:47] <%Stonks368> Would be funny if Widow would become as shy as Dusa kekDog
[2023-01-05 20:55:48] <%kettlerskyy> @pandacow5 also you see widow every time when she is shooting you lmao
[2023-01-05 20:55:50] <%+Quizzystyle> i was dominating with lucio earliers
[2023-01-05 20:55:55] <MurderMegan> another fucking massive flop from blizzard
[2023-01-05 20:55:55] <sour12345678> try hog

[2023-01-05 20:55:59] <NewbEInVR> this event kinda sucks ngl
[2023-01-05 20:55:59] <%clearqueue> JQ or Lucio is probably gonna get the statue
[2023-01-05 20:56:00] <+aj7continue> HOW did they think it's a good idea to put her against tanks
[2023-01-05 20:56:00] <audball028> i do not think widow is the play tbh
[2023-01-05 20:56:01] <novanex00> I just won one with rein it's the best felling YEAH
[2023-01-05 20:56:01] <codeJester> @cl0ud_dealer probably just her ult
[2023-01-05 20:56:02] <itzpugget> Game mode is absolutely the most unfun shit I've ever touched
[2023-01-05 20:56:04] <%Thevrex> my favorite part about the story of medusa is how she had a french accent KEKW
[2023-01-05 20:56:04] <+SteadySwerve_> why are you doing this to yourself widow aint it in this gamemode
[2023-01-05 20:56:06] <slideeda> jq pretty fun in this gamemode if ur not being shit on by 30 roadhogs
[2023-01-05 20:56:07] <%SonicWaveGaming1> @oztw exactly its a smart move
[2023-01-05 20:56:07] <delanyturnerl> @raepopsicles you know there’s a difference between event and LTM right???
[2023-01-05 20:56:08] <%+Quizzystyle> booping in wall is stun
[2023-01-05 20:56:10] <%$TeaHauss> monkaHmm imagine complaining about the game mode and saying its cringe instead of just saying "this isnt for me" and moving on
[2023-01-05 20:56:11] <%+Choocharoo> Being half asleep probably aint helping
[2023-01-05 20:56:11] <SL_Nerf_Herder> just shoot hog 8 more times
[2023-01-05 20:56:15] <+TheeBlackGoku> Can she only turn enemies to stone in Ult?
[2023-01-05 20:56:17] <antjord> phara and JQ dominate

[2023-01-05 20:56:20] <+Fluenzo> Making the entire event a solo mode was a bad idea
