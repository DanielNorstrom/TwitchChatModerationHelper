[2022-12-17 09:39:23] <%KaitoOnTheClock> What are words?
[2022-12-17 09:39:35] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> I know words are hard @LT_Jakal
[2022-12-17 09:39:36] <@%LT_Jakal> i dunno some squiggles or something

[2022-12-17 09:40:04] <!%Nimnitz> The ancient egytians also had problems with words
[2022-12-17 09:40:21] <!%Nimnitz> That is why we have pictogramms
[2022-12-17 09:40:21] <@%LT_Jakal> pictures are nicer
[2022-12-17 09:40:49] <%KaitoOnTheClock> "One picture can speak a thousand words"
[2022-12-17 09:41:04] <!%Nimnitz> But no less troublesome than words
[2022-12-17 09:41:11] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> I will almost always give people another chance to redeem themselves before out right banning them ceriNOD
[2022-12-17 09:41:16] <!%Nimnitz> Tell that to an art critic
[2022-12-17 09:42:20] <@%LT_Jakal> I go for the message delete first, normally, timeout if it's multiple things, and if its really bad then a ban
[2022-12-17 09:43:06] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> @LT_Jakal that is what I tend to do too

[2022-12-17 10:37:49] <%Darkfirephoenix> The new basic whip only attacks in the direction you are looking at tho. So it may take some time to get used to. And the attack area is a bit small

[2022-12-17 10:41:14] <%A4CE> this game fought against piracy and won, by giving the game away for literally free
[2022-12-17 10:41:17] <+Kaithar> you're probably close to where you can just stand still and let them throw themselves at soul eater

[2022-12-17 10:42:56] <%Darkfirephoenix> Game Dev Tycoon or such (one of them games where you run a game dev company) also put the game onto pirate sites, but with a "fun" thing added: Piracy that slowly but surely lowers money you aren ingame cuz people pirate your games LUL
[2022-12-17 10:43:23] <%A4CE> im a noob in PoE, i only have 1500 hours in that game
[2022-12-17 10:43:47] <%Darkfirephoenix> Now the dev added that as an additional difficulty option LUL
[2022-12-17 10:43:48] <%+Maleqai> I got like 150 lol it seems I m the biggest noon here
[2022-12-17 10:43:49] <Rahsed> PoE is a solid game but the devs are freaking clueless at times so the balance is a bit of a ping pong situation
[2022-12-17 10:43:52] <%+Maleqai> noob
[2022-12-17 10:44:16] <%jaydarkberry> it's a product of New Zealand, of course the devs don't know what they're doing

[2022-12-17 10:44:18] <assassin0223> you can also use the mouse to control the game, just click and hold and move mouse
[2022-12-17 10:44:21] <@%LT_Jakal> man I got 1 hour in PoE because my friend handheld and carried me and it was super boring xD
[2022-12-17 10:44:32] <$sircool099> I love getting so high level in this game where the only sound that can be heard is just utter noise
[2022-12-17 10:44:35] <Rahsed> I remember playing Arc a long time ago but it was doing not great at the time and switching to Spark was much better LUL

[2022-12-17 11:36:22] <!%$RickAltair> Cerise picks up what looks like chicken, but it ends up being a bag of tengu tax and a note.  She tries to read the note, but the Twitch compressed framerate during the gameplay is garbage.  As she puts the note in the bag, she hears a sound come from it.  Listening closely, she hears the words “love your face” in that one crow’s voice.  Her smile brightens as she proceeds to slaughter everything on screen. cheer100
