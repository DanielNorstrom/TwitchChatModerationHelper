[2023-01-07 13:44:50] <+lanre17> I bet your dad is so disappointed. Who wants to raise a man who plays with Madrid? Do you always take the lazy way? Do you work at target and work and go to the local community college? I bet he asks you how that degree is coming like 3 times a month. It’s always the same though isn’t it. That tinge of shame, then a small outburst. “I’m working on it dad, and my app is gonna take off”. But there is no app, is there. There’s no hope. Just loneliness.
[2023-01-07 13:44:55] <ryanb2717> he conceded 5 kimpem

[2023-01-07 13:52:15] <%+followthesponge> STOKES isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement in any game? TOMMY puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Other players breaks records. TOMMITHY breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic

Stokes is the money fight more than the May weather. they call him the old lad but he gets a year younger every year. he is the one and the LONELY Pashtag Pokes.
