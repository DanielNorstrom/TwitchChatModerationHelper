[2023-01-09 00:21:39] <+Panda_Kachui> that's why I don't play Tarkov

[2023-01-09 00:22:24] <+chops_djk> I’ve been 1 tapped more this wipe than any other wipe. Idk what it is about this wipe but I feel like I don’t have a chance in fights
[2023-01-09 00:22:34] <%+DrewGamer> any 1-tap does feel pretty bad, main reason I can't play Tarkov. Every 1-tap just triggers me SO hard.

[2023-01-09 05:12:54] <%lil_izy69> @thesavagecoder we normally backseat it's normal for us bc Hutch needs help alot so we backseat all the time
[2023-01-09 05:12:56] <%+TheSavageCoder> @lil_izy69 I think suggestions are great. Spamming in all caps the same message a half dozen times? less of a suggestion

[2023-01-09 05:13:52] <%lil_izy69> @thesavagecoder if hutch has a problem with it he normally let's us know so it's quite normal for us to backseat
[2023-01-09 05:14:01] <%IUltraxx> @freetherocktv streamer mode is useless in EFT, if you kill somebody he is still seeing your name on his dead screen. It only does not show up for you and so your viewers dont know your name

[2023-01-09 18:10:34] <+dingle_berries> reddit use to be preemo in the past. It seems like facebook users have migrated there
[2023-01-09 18:10:37] <%NomadicOG> And half the time you can't even post a real review because they delete what they don't agree with.

[2023-01-09 18:29:06] <Bap181> The main problem is that the AS VAL is still fucking dogshit, remains to be seen if the ammo can carry it. But I doubt it.

[2023-01-09 18:47:16] <itzzdeno> np
[2023-01-09 18:47:18] <%d4n1kcs> @heklar yeah but someone was saying audio needs to be fixed .. I answered the audio is much better than the last one and now what they should do is optimize the game as much as they can ... because I have a good pc and a not bad gpu .. how can I not play with more than 60 fps ... makes no sense
[2023-01-09 18:47:21] <%khemster> anyone know if raider weapons were nerfed?
[2023-01-09 18:47:43] <+xzent0x> @HutchMF Do you have like tips or guide for new players? Like a video?

[2023-01-09 18:47:54] <%tomc1k> Yeah, no more one taps from scavs
[2023-01-09 18:47:59] <TSvassilev> @khemster when they shoot you - no. when you get them - yes.
[2023-01-09 18:48:03] <%khemster> i was in an offline raid and all their weapons were below half qual
[2023-01-09 18:48:06] <%tgwolf12> so upon further investimigations the under barrel grenade launcher is dog and just adds weight to you !
[2023-01-09 18:48:10] <%+coatsie> @d4n1kcs Bc tarkov isn’t very optimized, also very cpu intensive
[2023-01-09 18:48:10] <Pandora_Finder> what are a few things you/klean suggested?
[2023-01-09 18:48:14] <%d4n1kcs> @entropyb whattt ? Mate just shut up
[2023-01-09 18:48:15] <+goofie13> @heklar yea but at least with 1 fps looking the right way you can click. If you just have your back turned for free kill bec audio doesn’t matter if you have 1000 fps
[2023-01-09 18:48:19] <+saw_blades> you can't do this all at once you got to do it slowly over multiple wipes
[2023-01-09 18:48:27] <akumaguts> where can i read about the changes? @HutchMF
[2023-01-09 18:48:30] <+Dewfl0p> klean is over the top with his nerf requests though.
[2023-01-09 18:48:35] <%tomc1k> I think they nerfed the scav reaction time to your possition, they seem to walk pass ppl now

[2023-01-09 18:49:55] <akumaguts> what klean forgets is that not everyone plays this game everyday for 8 to 12hrs and not everyone plays in groups, nerfing ammo will fuck even more solo players @HutchMF

[2023-01-09 18:50:25] <%+OriginalAntiHero> @entropyb I don’t know why he can’t understand that more than one thing needs to be worked on. Audio needs to be fixed and so does optimization… I mentioned audio needs to be fixed and you’d think the guy worked on the in game audio himself.

[2023-01-09 18:52:38] <%CptHagg13z> i think AMMO should be only in raid find and craft and make it very little of top tear

[2023-01-09 18:53:34] <%+Crashinz> meta ammo ruins the game now or late in wipe when it only takes 3 bullets to kil

[2023-01-09 18:53:48] <%+Mak0s_> i damn hope that you cant buy all those meta ammo ever, just can find it in raids

[2023-01-09 18:54:02] <%justchillinjay> @emilfjord 762 BP is attainable through hideout as well, just a grind but it is very possible to stock up

[2023-01-09 20:49:34] <%+dani_vic> @DiMEMM0  than what does you having a gun having to do with a criminal? gun laws arent for daily criminal running around getting a black gun. Its to make sure someone who is sick in their head has to go through many layers of trying to find a gun than just walk into the store and get one
[2023-01-09 20:49:35] <+quore_23> @hummbaby04 not sure.  i just think it is cool and would be fun.  I have one them at the range only once.  i was mesmerized just by the cool factor.  but that is me.

[2023-01-09 22:10:12] <vogurt> @crojss that has nothing to do with it
[2023-01-09 22:10:14] <+iiurgency> I started using that SV98 last wipe with BT and i love it lol
[2023-01-09 22:10:17] <%DefiantMF> @lI_Phantom_lI His tarkov character figured MAID was a good idea but used a nade to do it.
[2023-01-09 22:10:18] <+iiurgency> Its so fun to use
[2023-01-09 22:10:18] <crojss> for example on summits stream or others like hutch its good
[2023-01-09 22:10:25] <%lI_Phantom_lI> Nade*

[2023-01-09 22:10:45] <%$xKH3> bruh i dont understand how twitch's bit rate is so low when they are competing with youtube
[2023-01-09 22:10:49] <+cykodryver> one way windows op
[2023-01-09 22:11:03] <%lil_izy69> @crojss bc they have a high partnership with twitch so they get better bitrate
[2023-01-09 22:11:08] <luap_2a> @xKH3 they have thousands more streamers
[2023-01-09 22:11:09] <%thisfunnyguykekw> @LKZEUS tbh that's a sumMolly moment KEKW
[2023-01-09 22:11:09] <Snowtraze> hutch left klean's stream on 720p or 480p, this is not 1080p you're watching
[2023-01-09 22:11:11] <OmegaTooYew> @Klutcheyy for slow paced/non high foliage games or single player stuff it can work but yeah generally this is correct
[2023-01-09 22:11:19] <MajoraSW> well this is a stream within a stream sooo
[2023-01-09 22:11:25] <vogurt> @crojss u can have nasa internet but if twitch only lets you have 4 pixels, you can only get 4 pixels through.
[2023-01-09 22:11:29] <savagesnowball1> @xKH3 to reduce operating costs
[2023-01-09 22:11:39] <@%^StreamElements> Keep up with Hutch when he isn't streaming with his Twitter: https://twitter.com/HutchMF
[2023-01-09 22:11:42] <Snowtraze> chat hes watching klean at 720p. its not 1080 LUL

[2023-01-09 22:12:52] <Snowtraze> @lil_izy69 wrong. hutch is watching him at 720p. klean actually streams at 1080p (which this isnt)
[2023-01-09 22:12:52] <vogurt> @crojss NASA = USA space program lol just a exaggeration you could have best internet in the world tarkov would look like this on stream some times
[2023-01-09 22:13:07] <%DefiantMF> @crojss NASA probably makes use of military satellites for their internet soooo...
[2023-01-09 22:13:23] <Snowtraze> @HutchMF fyi ur watching klean at like 720p

[2023-01-09 22:15:01] <Snowtraze> @lil_izy69 yes klean streams at 1080 but hutch selected 720p when watching him. that's why the quality is bad
[2023-01-09 22:15:06] <%lil_izy69> @snowtraze nothing to do with what quality or anything like that twitch bitrate is ass and it's a stream in a stream

[2023-01-09 22:33:49] <Raeks_> @defiantmf  people will farm raiders for bp and selling it very expensive
[2023-01-09 22:33:50] <SpiritEX> but they already have good ammo stocked

[2023-01-09 22:34:08] <%+shad3dspectr3> some of the best fights are early wipe or after a ban wave
[2023-01-09 22:34:15] <CrowFlies00> @HutchMF those people that played 100 hours just to get that ammo is nothing for them to play another 50, they do that in what 3 days at max.
[2023-01-09 22:34:17] <touristog> its a good change. only mental gymnsists will say its not
[2023-01-09 22:34:23] <+XTNlCK> worst headphones in the game
[2023-01-09 22:34:40] <+TheNewVirus_> it really only affects grinders and high lvls. at this point in wipe theres still only a smalll percentage of people using that tier of ammo
[2023-01-09 22:34:43] <%DefiantMF> @Raeks_ The best ammo is not on the flea. And them farming it? Heh, it just invites other players to ambush.
[2023-01-09 22:34:51] <+XTNlCK> sounds muffled or radioized

[2023-01-09 22:35:25] <Raeks_> @defiantmf well people will play more labs to farm good ammo since bosses are 5% spawn rate
[2023-01-09 22:35:25] <+iiurgency> Where can we get your songs at to play?
[2023-01-09 22:35:26] <+TheRoyalHam> top 10% of chads get helped even more like when they changed to quest keys to one-use after all the grinders finished the quests. but overall it balances the other 90%
[2023-01-09 22:35:28] <rdogg1100> Damn what a boss move
