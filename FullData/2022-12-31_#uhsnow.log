[2022-12-31 13:47:39] <%+SanyaIV> Or is that the wrong name?

[2022-12-31 13:55:59] <+fragly_> Hmm what mod did it Hmm
[2022-12-31 13:55:59] <+BakinPacman> does the automod add phrases if bots do stuff like that?
[2022-12-31 13:56:04] <@%Prollos> I cant see it being one of the regular mods
[2022-12-31 13:56:13] <nicbig99> I checked the one channel Im modded in, nothing there Hmm
[2022-12-31 13:56:31] <Catainia> You can check to see who added it in mod hsitory
[2022-12-31 13:56:34] <Catainia> in mod mode
[2022-12-31 13:56:36] <%$Rolling_Thunder197> it can be checked in Mod View I believe?
[2022-12-31 13:56:39] <%CarolineSwitched> That’s so strange. I can’t imagine any Snow mod doing that.
[2022-12-31 13:56:47] <+BakinPacman> its interesting to look for i guess

[2022-12-31 14:35:10] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> i would not mind if fireworks were just outlawed alltogether, leave it to professionals
[2022-12-31 14:35:15] <%+the_only_tetra> i just wish only displays could use the loud ones and home use the silent ones
[2022-12-31 14:35:16] <mangnaflamma> My dog hates them and she’s an old lady dog so hopefully none too close to the house
[2022-12-31 14:35:16] <%Stealthkillah122> @trubbel i like them but im not one of those asswipes that let me off weeks in advance for new years for example
[2022-12-31 14:35:21] <%+BuggyDaman> i used to love fireworks now they make it hard for me to sleep... growing up sucks
[2022-12-31 14:35:22] <%$Rolling_Thunder197> I stopped going to see fireworks, they're nothing compared to Disney fireworks
[2022-12-31 14:35:56] <@%Trubbel> @Stealthkillah122 if i was in the middle of nowhere i wouldnt mind setting some off, but not in the city in an area with lots of pets around
[2022-12-31 14:35:58] <%T2Slay> there is ways and means around it if it actually didn't happen

[2022-12-31 14:36:31] <Datpaper420> i live in the stix so fireworks are at every gas station, they were cool when you were younger but nowi see people blowing their fingers off, aint what it used to be
[2022-12-31 14:36:35] <Sufficate> i think they should ban fireworks
[2022-12-31 14:36:36] <%$Kilrathal> I'm so thankful my cat actually loves fireworks
[2022-12-31 14:36:37] <%beakyreaps> my cats dont care about fireworks

[2022-12-31 14:36:46] <%Machatie> I give my dog pills for new year

[2022-12-31 14:37:03] <$Ganzlol> There are new Fireworks that is Silent, but its still pretty new

[2022-12-31 14:37:13] <+fragly_> Sadge fireworks are banned here
[2022-12-31 14:37:15] <%Stealthkillah122> make it illigal to sell till a week before hand would be easier
[2022-12-31 14:37:16] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> yeah normal citizens shouldn't have access to what's effectively a small bomb on a stick
[2022-12-31 14:37:21] <%CarolineSwitched> I love how holidays feel like they are longer with all the different time zones. FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-31 14:37:30] <@%$Slasher2099> i think it should be more organized , one hour in the night etc or just have cities do firework shows but having people blast them for hours is annoying af
[2022-12-31 14:37:31] <%VariantIN> The air here gets so bad around New Years because of fireworks...it's disgusting.
[2022-12-31 14:37:33] <%+the_only_tetra> i just wish only displays could use the loud ones and home use the silent ones
[2022-12-31 14:37:33] <+Abi45x> My two cats are terrified of them, usually they end up hiding under my quilt
[2022-12-31 14:37:35] <kalekarbonade> Here in The Netherlands it will look like world war 3
[2022-12-31 14:37:37] <%+Saichen> my cats hate fireworks and sirens
[2022-12-31 14:37:37] <%Stealthkillah122> @ninjat_rexarmy but they can have a car that can kill people 😉

[2022-12-31 14:37:50] <@%$Slasher2099> esp if you are outside and some idiot throws some fucking shit at your feet
[2022-12-31 14:37:58] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> @Stealthkillah122 but a car is actually useful (besides the killing part) ;)
[2022-12-31 14:37:59] <%Machatie> In my country its like till 1-2am
[2022-12-31 14:38:03] <Sufficate> i had to give my dog sedation becouse he was terrifed by them
[2022-12-31 14:38:04] <%Jeannie772> Our dog doesn't care, my son's GF's dog is terrified. She will literally crawl in bed with me and hide under the covers Sadge
[2022-12-31 14:38:07] <mangnaflamma> Cuz who needs fireworks at 3 am
[2022-12-31 14:38:11] <TheDapperPenguinOfficial> Having designated areas for firework shows should also be a big thing

[2022-12-31 14:40:57] <%$Kilrathal> i mean same as the electric scooters. legal to buy but illegal to use in public
[2022-12-31 14:41:04] <Fataldh> If you buy fireworks but don't use them, are they fireunemployed?
[2022-12-31 14:41:06] <%$Rolling_Thunder197> where's the logic behind that? that's so odd
[2022-12-31 14:41:06] <%+Saichen> yeah, you have to take them out of state lulz.

[2022-12-31 14:41:16] <@%$Slasher2099> WutFace
[2022-12-31 14:41:22] <Datpaper420> i had to go through a fire station program to get my permit, andi ts pretty livid that 1) ya need to call and let em know you're igniting them and 2) you have to have adequate water/extinguishers and witness's
[2022-12-31 14:41:23] <@%$Slasher2099> we literally have the ones you can rent
[2022-12-31 14:41:25] <%+wozabekk> lol scooters?
[2022-12-31 14:41:27] <%twisty_mc> shelf display only, nothing more cosy than decrotive live fireworks Kappa
[2022-12-31 14:41:30] <%$Kilrathal> Yup they're illegal unless you're using one from the council trial schemes
[2022-12-31 14:41:31] <%+wozabekk> sheesh
[2022-12-31 14:41:31] <+Abi45x> They're not legal in public spaces in the UK
[2022-12-31 14:41:33] <@%$Slasher2099> ohh yeah if they don't have bike paths maybe
[2022-12-31 14:41:34] <$Rem753> @Slasher2099 probably not road legal, mirrors lights and plate
[2022-12-31 14:41:34] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> do you mean hoverboards? i know they're been outlawed
[2022-12-31 14:41:34] <mangnaflamma> Depends where you are for electric scooters
[2022-12-31 14:41:36] <%Stealthkillah122> we have electric scooters for people to use at my local hospital
[2022-12-31 14:41:36] <@%$Slasher2099> cause street rules
[2022-12-31 14:41:38] <DuckmanGamingLive> duckma1Dab  morning
[2022-12-31 14:41:40] <%$Kilrathal> Essex police take them all the time
[2022-12-31 14:41:43] <usajeff> Yeah cuz we have legal gas scooters here too
[2022-12-31 14:41:44] <+DD0RE> you can use them if there rented in the uk but ot if you own your own
[2022-12-31 14:41:47] <%$fitNihil> To be fair they're super dangerous those scooters
[2022-12-31 14:41:55] <+kewlkwest> we have a burn ban here, but different places have different laws
[2022-12-31 14:42:01] <+Strykkerrrr> In Ireland Fireworks are illegal, no exceptions.
[2022-12-31 14:42:06] <@%$Slasher2099> the scooters are dangerous if people are not riding them properly or paying attention
[2022-12-31 14:42:14] <+Jjjta1994> we have electric scooters everywhere .. can rent them for like 5$
[2022-12-31 14:42:22] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> @Datpaper420 why? that seems extremely logical..
[2022-12-31 14:42:24] <@%$Slasher2099> but that's the same thing with pretty much everything else
[2022-12-31 14:42:25] <%+Saichen> imagine enforcing scooter licenses
[2022-12-31 14:42:26] <%Stealthkillah122> yeah drone licence needed in the uk too im sure
[2022-12-31 14:42:27] <+John_Hartley> think that depends on how high they can fly ?
[2022-12-31 14:42:29] <XBsnipes21> Yea
[2022-12-31 14:42:29] <Datpaper420> Its cause they are hella stuck up about it, literally lose your permit if ya back talk
[2022-12-31 14:42:35] <mangnaflamma> God I hate those fucking scooters people just drive out in front of cars here
[2022-12-31 14:42:39] <$Rem753> in my state you need a license to fly it over a certain altitude
[2022-12-31 14:42:42] <+DD0RE> i see little kids on them they without any protection at all
[2022-12-31 14:42:44] <usajeff> Drone licensing here in Cali are getting pretty serious
[2022-12-31 14:42:53] <+John_Hartley> and like near airports and the like is banned
[2022-12-31 14:42:55] <%Machatie> Drone license in my country is if the drone is above 250grams
[2022-12-31 14:42:58] <%$Kilrathal> @uhSnow yeh that is the issue. the law isn't up to speed yet. so they are treated as a motorcycle due to not being power'assisted' so you need a full motorcycle licence insurance etc but insurance for them doesn't exist

[2022-12-31 15:11:46] <Datpaper420> @ImmaHoodieNinja LOL the difference between a fence hook and a door knob is the door knob twists both ways while the fence hook is more manual
[2022-12-31 15:11:51] <Fataldh> Males scientifically get colds/flus worse than womens. We're weaker internally than women so suffer worse from it

[2022-12-31 15:12:37] <educated_monkey> isn't 'man flu' like "I am soooo sick, I can't doe anything" even if it isn't so bad?

[2022-12-31 16:19:21] <%AkumaXRock> well hated and murder is murder, but even if it was aliens being told to kill humans cause same thing being told a naraative, but they still *and even enjoy or embrace ) killing under that "reason" is the ones that do need sorry, even if they were pushed to that point, but that push from being told a lie you feel sorry for them a bit the line is drawn on killing of other in general. Yes i agree with you snow, but people got to own up to killing other people.

[2022-12-31 16:22:08] <Seobarth> The french used a different measurement for inches back then and by their standard he was 5'2" so that could be one reason he was believed to be shorter than he was.

[2022-12-31 16:33:19] <virusjohn> yeah having some form of whitelist style way of doing it will make sure that the corruption RP doesnt wash over all the other RP in the server i guess

[2022-12-31 16:35:22] <@%Prollos> and to get approval they should present an "end goal" of sorts to admins imo, the whole point of a serial killer should be to get caught imo NODDERS
[2022-12-31 16:35:26] <Sanraku> a corrupt cop can be fun but it can't be widespread. and the person doing it must know that once they are caught that char is done for

[2022-12-31 17:32:29] <@%Nikez> I mean kyle laid in a fucking bed for 8h and had 8k viewers. People crave RP.
[2022-12-31 17:32:31] <%slampy15> @uhsnow but winning a gun fight gets you more subs and viewers. thats the unfortunate part.

[2022-12-31 17:33:02] <NohhMe> @Nikez But a lot of it was people who came to the bed to give the RP. Specially Nikki on Jenny
[2022-12-31 17:33:04] <%robertsmithjr> for me my favorite stuff to watch is either a good story line, or watching how much time devs spend enabling roleplay, its incredible @Nikez
[2022-12-31 17:33:11] <nicbig99> Wasnt watching much RP. Fell into Nikki's stream at the start of December and it has been a rollercoaster since NODDERS
[2022-12-31 17:33:23] <JumJumTV> its been going on for far too long, not sure why it all shifted away from RP which is what drew everyone in from the first place.

[2022-12-31 17:38:02] <@%Nikez> Also RE: the "real RP", the viewer base is still very much there. I've somehow managed to sustain 1k viewers from just 300 or so, only doing "boring" hospital RP. Zero poggers. Zero bombs. Zero shootings. Zero crime actually. So, I am just saying, the viewers are still out there. The ones that crave actual RP and not pogtent. I am flabbergasted that people watch and enjoy just meetings and talks so.
