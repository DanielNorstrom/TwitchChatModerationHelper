[2022-12-27 16:47:54] <+SinRecon> @HisWattson zero drop is the term you are looking for
[2022-12-27 16:47:57] <ShottiePro> I do around 4 miles walk barefoot and run on the beach also, it really helps posture
[2022-12-27 16:47:58] <%Rein_Dear> barefooting is natural, obviously. Just not socially acceptable.
[2022-12-27 16:48:04] <%Spocket> lol yes walk on bare concrete and destroy your legs
[2022-12-27 16:48:15] <+Puma_> bro since 11th grade ??

[2022-12-27 16:48:34] <+EasyParodox> Barefoot shoes is a mission and half to get used to but you should get toe spacers as well

[2022-12-27 16:49:16] <+EasyParodox> Soccer
[2022-12-27 16:49:17] <Gojira_Son> It‚Äôs gonna suck in the beginning but once you get used to them you‚Äôll notice how strong your stance is cause your base will be stronger
[2022-12-27 16:49:18] <Medjay_Mart> Dude said soccer

[2022-12-27 16:49:40] <+GP0T> Check out Xero shoes. They have a wide toe area no lift
[2022-12-27 16:49:40] <krunchy24k> I think u go no socks with em
[2022-12-27 16:49:43] <+khornettv> depends, if they have the toes seperated, then probably yes, if they don't then no @HisWattson
[2022-12-27 16:49:43] <bCanski> Start with like a single digit heel drop first

[2022-12-27 18:28:51] <whataburgerfancyketchup> The greatest differences between a zebra and a horse are their size, speed, and coloration. Zebras are smaller and lighter than horses, but they can exceed them in length. Zebras are also slower than horses in the majority of cases, but they are fast animals in their own respect
