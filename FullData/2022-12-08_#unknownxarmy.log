[2022-12-08 19:56:00] <Blind185> i mean controller kids have to work on mechs, they know how to aim, and keyboard players know how to build with ease, they need to work on aim

[2022-12-08 20:06:56] <+gabe1xs> @obi_nnaji bro you just don‚Äôt get it. My point is that controller is only a handicap if you are trying to get surge or playing the best of the best. You can place in  any tourney relying on game sense.

[2022-12-08 20:10:19] <@+ImSpeedzy> epicgames logic: keep making worse variations of the pump and tac instead of just bringing the og back

[2022-12-08 20:11:33] <+obi_nnaji> @gabe1xs That's almost like saying a 5'3 basketball player would be better than a 6'6 basketball player if they score every three they shoot. You are ignoring the case where the 6'6 player can also shoot as good, so now the 6'6 player is not only as good at shooting 3s, he's bigger and can dunk etc.
[2022-12-08 20:11:35] <Blind185> why is kells so ass

[2022-12-08 20:14:02] <jeyloupnow> are you going to play Fncs
[2022-12-08 20:14:02] <+gabe1xs> @obi_nnaji it really took you ten mins to give that horrible comparison. It‚Äôs obvious that controller has been nerfed too much. But most controller players haven‚Äôt even reached their full potential yet and complain as if controller is the only thing keeping them from being a pro. Plus you can always just switch if you really care
[2022-12-08 20:14:31] <ifillc0ffinzz> @YeGenesis kmb is easier because it's more straight forward. both inputs easily have their benefits though.
