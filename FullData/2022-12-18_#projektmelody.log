[2022-12-18 14:03:27] <guztawskykow> I just can't really immerse myself in games with 2D / top down / isometric perspective. Really rips me out of the world. melSip

[2022-12-18 14:14:52] <VladosFire54> PauseChamp there is first pov mod for don't starve
[2022-12-18 15:15:44] <guztawskykow> Whut? How does that even work when the game is only 2D? D:
[2022-12-18 15:16:29] <@%Mad_Klauss> It's more like 2.5D so first person view can be possible
[2022-12-18 15:17:15] <guztawskykow> mind=blown
[2022-12-18 15:17:17] <@%Mad_Klauss> Similarly yo the original Wolfenstein which was 2D but made as a first person game.
[2022-12-18 15:18:11] <guztawskykow> Yeah, I was thinking of that, but never assumed that Don't Starve would use that method.
[2022-12-18 15:24:46] <guztawskykow> Just seems overkill for a game you can't even turn around in.
