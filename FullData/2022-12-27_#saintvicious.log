[2022-12-27 20:06:04] <!%+kappakappalaw> passport card is very limited, you can't do international air travel with it
[2022-12-27 20:06:33] <Caethy> Passport Card is a national ID card. It's not valid for international travel.
[2022-12-27 20:06:38] <!%+kappakappalaw> no, they are different
[2022-12-27 20:06:50] <+papapover> passport card is bogus....you should get passport book to international travel
[2022-12-27 20:07:04] <GoofyBrah> TLDR dont get a passport card lol
