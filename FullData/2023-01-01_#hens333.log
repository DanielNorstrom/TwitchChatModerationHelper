[2023-01-01 00:57:49] <@%^Nightbot> Rules of a survivor escape streak: All survivors will start with no items. Survivors who escape with an item may use it in future matches. A win is 3-4 survivors have to escape the match. No offerings or item add-ons are allowed. The team can only use every perk once.

[2023-01-01 16:15:20] <%ClussyHonks> Every Oni ive faced can do it Sadge
[2023-01-01 16:15:22] <%ObsidianLiger> @Hens333 External monitors only give you better performance on laptops if your laptop has a muxless gpu passthrough
[2023-01-01 16:15:24] <+Spaghett0w0> Oni let‚Äôs would be refreshing from a nurse one tbh
[2023-01-01 16:15:38] <ninjadragon21345> @DemonicGhost27_ i mean, its hard to say its unfair since its jus a sensitivity thing. its not really a feature
[2023-01-01 16:15:39] <+bl55r> do you prefer to play killer or survivor
[2023-01-01 16:15:44] <TJMnoob> why do you have 2 of the same doctor build in your best killer builds doc

[2023-01-01 16:16:16] <%+Commander_Ray> best way to beat oni is to deny him a hit
[2023-01-01 16:16:19] <+bl55r> killer is more fun to watch

[2023-01-01 16:53:20] <NoName_DP> the issue is its too late now to make them iri. people have like a million offerings now. either rework or remove imo

[2023-01-01 16:53:29] <%ObsidianLiger> I guess it depends on the killer, if you're like bubba, garden hitboxes screw you, but on huntress eyrie hitboxes screw you
[2023-01-01 16:53:37] <%EvilD34d> @chadderoni Nemesis is a slower starter‚Ä¶so early game wesker is stronger. Probably even when nemesis is tier 3

[2023-01-01 18:31:41] <Lichmere> the knight is sadly boring. wish there was more to the kit
[2023-01-01 18:31:45] <+iCHOZEN1_> Ello
[2023-01-01 18:31:52] <jeffthebambo> a 1 hr stream with knight 3 gen pog?
[2023-01-01 18:32:05] <KamiyumiTV> Is there any proper way to determine MMR? I have around 400 hours now and I get matched with 3k+ players alot, both as surv and killer. Sometimes even games sometimes I get ran over completely
[2023-01-01 18:32:15] <oskardbd> you prob get asked a lot but do you notice a difference between eu and na matches?

[2023-01-01 18:32:21] <+iCHOZEN1_> @kamiyumitv mmr is fake Kappa
[2023-01-01 18:32:22] <%gria> if you have won like 30 matches ever you are probably max mmr

[2023-01-01 18:32:55] <%+magic_mat1> MMR may as well not really exist imo
[2023-01-01 18:33:06] <%+magic_mat1> I get obvious babies and gods in the same lobby as killer
[2023-01-01 18:33:07] <KamiyumiTV> I am decent

[2023-01-01 18:33:18] <KamiyumiTV> so I improved quickly
[2023-01-01 18:33:26] <+RezedentSleeper> i got less than 300 hours and i get matched with p100s
[2023-01-01 18:33:42] <KamiyumiTV> I played vs lilith omen yesterday, kinda funny

[2023-01-01 18:35:16] <InflnityBlack> quantum mmr, your mmr is both low and high at the same time and their is no way to tell without starting a game (and the result may change every time you repeat the experience)
