[2023-01-06 08:09:17] <@%sesamefig> It has a hygrometer so it turns off and on within 5% of the relative humidity I set it at
[2023-01-06 08:09:29] <@%sesamefig> So if I set it for 75% it turns on at 70%

[2023-01-06 08:09:36] <@%sesamefig> And turns off at 80%

[2023-01-06 09:25:21] <%MunchMeisterVT> yeah I feel that too, whispering constricts your vocal cords iirc so that's why it's really tough on your voice if done improperly (so I heard), idk how all those whisper-only asmritsts do it

Like when there's foreshadowing that something bad will happen to the main characters this person feels fear and when it does happen the person cries for their characters and by the end of the story this person is exhausted from all the emotions the story made them feel.

Like when there's foreshadowing that something bad will happen to the main characters this person feels fear and when it does happen the person cries for their characters and by the end of the story this person is exhausted from all the emotions the story made them feel. How does this person (a friend) just enjoy the story and not feel like shit when it's done?]

[2023-01-06 10:01:30] <Even_n0w> Dad I have a question. What if your a person that never felt attached to anyone and always felt detached to almost everyone that are strangers yet when to your family you feel happy and joyous, people always asked you "why don't you try actually be friends" or "you will find somebody someday" when it comes to  having a friend or a potential lover. As you never felt romantic to anyone nor feel a want to friend someone unless you need to be, rather than feeling lonely you feel content and happy

What if your a person that never felt attached to anyone and always felt detached to almost everyone that are strangers yet when to your family you feel happy and joyous, people always asked you "why don't you try actually be friends" or "you will find somebody someday" when it comes to having a friend or a potential lover. As you never felt romantic to anyone nor feel a want to friend someone unless you need to be, rather than feeling lonely you feel content and happy]

[2023-01-06 12:31:56] <SeenConnroy> Scorn is less so puzzle or shooter
[2023-01-06 12:32:03] <SeenConnroy> It's more of a story/artistic piece
[2023-01-06 12:32:08] <ttkartemis> But Signalis is amazing

[2023-01-06 12:32:11] <PersicaDollily> Scorn was an unfinished game, imo. poor checkpointing system with no manual saves, high reliance on jank combat to space out puzzles. the art though? beautiful
