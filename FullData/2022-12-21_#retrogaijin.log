[2022-12-21 15:43:33] <P3NGU1NSMACKER> They put a lot into the interior for sure
[2022-12-21 15:43:34] <%DonyWahlberg> Thats 100% vinyl floors and cheap flip stuff
[2022-12-21 15:43:36] <%+brewmeister_beej> not necessarily 80k profit @RetroGaijin no clue what they had to put into it
[2022-12-21 15:43:38] <!%+ms_alex_games> Yes looks like a flip
[2022-12-21 15:43:38] <AstroScooby> Depends on how much he spent on upgrades
[2022-12-21 15:43:40] <%Tal_lovesbuns> might be bad neighborhood or hidden issues
[2022-12-21 15:43:41] <+fantaaaa> they invested 80k COPIUM
[2022-12-21 15:43:41] <%DonyWahlberg> Probably put 20K into it or a little more

[2022-12-21 15:47:55] <%WildJokerr> @tal_lovesbuns no problem. Learned from family members. New houses construct a lot differently than they did 50 years ago as well. I know you wouldn‚Äôt think that be a real issue but it can be
[2022-12-21 15:48:03] <%$Zencodion> are these houses close to stores? retroHMM
[2022-12-21 15:48:11] <JustinRampage> The roof looked like it was sagging a bit. I could be wrong.

[2022-12-21 15:48:36] <%Tal_lovesbuns> @WildJokerr what i learned from couple years of house hunting is that you have to ask so many questions

[2022-12-21 15:56:35] <Tiberion> that roof is wack
[2022-12-21 15:56:42] <Ein23> do you know the neighborhoods? location makes a huge difference in price

[2022-12-21 15:56:49] <%WildJokerr> Not gonna lie one of the first things I did when I bought my house was to replace all the toilets @retrogaijin

[2022-12-21 15:57:10] <ghostxace> im gussing in ohio a lot of the houses are pretty old and have been renovated more than once, probably a good chance of hidden issues

[2022-12-21 15:57:29] <%DonyWahlberg> LUL not really true. Ours is 1962 its in great condition remodeled.
[2022-12-21 15:57:36] <Tiberion> asbestos is great. it's got best right in the name
[2022-12-21 15:57:41] <P3NGU1NSMACKER> you're not really planning on doing serious construction either
[2022-12-21 15:57:41] <%DonyWahlberg> If its single owner you gotta ask those questions but if its been sold it most likely is up to code
[2022-12-21 15:57:47] <%Tal_lovesbuns> My advice would be to choose areas youd like and which have good future prospects FIRST and then look for houses i nthose areas. Otherwhise you might become overwhelmed with choice paralysis.

[2022-12-21 15:58:05] <%DonyWahlberg> Its not a guaranteed thing to drop, depends how the market goes into 2023 spring
[2022-12-21 15:58:10] <!%+TehSneakyz> The interest rates on houses is insane right now too
[2022-12-21 15:58:13] <%DonyWahlberg> But its looking like itll drop based on recent movement...
[2022-12-21 15:58:32] <Tiberion> The Federal reserve keeps saying they're going to drop rates or at least stop raising them. but they haven't yet
[2022-12-21 15:58:36] <%DonyWahlberg> Rates have kind of frozen and stopped going up so financial people are guessing prices will reset soon
[2022-12-21 15:58:41] <SeanHubLive> Secure gate system

[2022-12-21 16:00:16] <%WildJokerr> It will drop when the market crashes but we don‚Äôt actually know when. Also unlike most recessions or bubbles this time institutions have inflated prices which accounts for most of the prices rising during covid. It might only drop by 20% at most bc institutional investors won‚Äôt act like regular buyers who will sell when in a bad situation. We are in like 1900s tenements era again
[2022-12-21 16:00:40] <Tiberion> it's weird that there are no stairs on it
