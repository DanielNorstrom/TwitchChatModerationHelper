[2022-12-27 10:47:55] <+MinimalDog> I mean, you will get 100 bucks back in no time using SodaStream instead of buying store water depending on how much you drink tbh
[2022-12-27 10:47:56] <%Xsquire> Probably cuz it‚Äôs imported over there. It‚Äôs always on sale here
[2022-12-27 10:48:11] <%Xsquire> It depends on how much you drink to see how much money you save
[2022-12-27 10:48:13] <Distxnct_> @Xsquire even in Canada its not exactly cheap
[2022-12-27 10:48:29] <Distxnct_> a fucking cylinder is 40$

[2022-12-27 11:00:02] <+potatoobject> not really as youa re ingesting the co2, not inhaling it. also, carbonated drinks have a really low amount of co2 in them. you need to inhale within single digit % of co2 for it to be risky

[2022-12-27 12:28:32] <+greyxx_> @firelordgukki before it looked chaotic but after some experience its more clear if that makes sense
[2022-12-27 12:28:34] <Razor__95> @Renrev95 im guessing support would be the easiest one?
[2022-12-27 12:28:35] <%Xsquire> @renrev95 generally higher swiftness classes are good for prog since you can survive more mechanics by dodging, etc.
[2022-12-27 12:28:36] <Jon_Ramsay> chat is this a 1-6 party?

[2022-12-27 12:29:08] <+mattyydubzz> @Renrev95 yeah any support is great for learning raids
[2022-12-27 12:29:14] <+leandrolplp> paladin is the easiest class imo
[2022-12-27 12:29:23] <+„Å†„Å´„ÅÑ (bmwxboy)> they need to change this A bottom it take so much time just to move to g2
[2022-12-27 12:29:33] <firelordgukki> @firelordgukki my main at 1415 that's why i'm asking eheh new player here
[2022-12-27 12:29:33] <Jon_Ramsay> i think this is faster because of all the valtan cutscenes?
[2022-12-27 12:29:45] <Jon_Ramsay> and then you still have to wait for him to do all the mechs in valtan?
[2022-12-27 12:29:47] <Razor__95> what would you say the average time for 1-6 is?
[2022-12-27 12:29:58] <Jon_Ramsay> 1-2 jrs @Razor__95
