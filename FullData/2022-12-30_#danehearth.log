[2022-12-30 12:45:31] <%BaronRedWings> @dumbgamerboy Both published by Sega so makes sense
[2022-12-30 12:45:58] <%BaronRedWings> Honestly Yakuza feels like the evolution of Shenmue in a lot of ways

[2022-12-30 13:52:11] <%theSatyriceon> lad you're ready for the forklifting business right there
[2022-12-30 13:52:32] <+robua_> That forklift is waaaay too fast for the real thing.

[2022-12-30 13:53:04] <+Scoutiver> There is a certain expectancy of asian games having something to do with samurais and ninjas. But they in reality gotta do forklifting just like us.
[2022-12-30 13:53:23] <%+littleballofhate> Honestly dont understand why Dane streams games when he's clearly a natural forklift operator, its his calling
[2022-12-30 13:53:29] <+robua_> Anyway this game's graphics were insane. It still looks good
[2022-12-30 13:53:59] <+robua_> Yeah. Wasted talent. This streamer belongs to the warehouse.
[2022-12-30 13:54:06] <$TrainStationTrash> can you lift like two at a time?
[2022-12-30 13:54:17] <%theSatyriceon> you gonna lift 10 or more for the raise?
[2022-12-30 13:54:26] <cartlul> foreman should give you a bonus so you can get more toys
