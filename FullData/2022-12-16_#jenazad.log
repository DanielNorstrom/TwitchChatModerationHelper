[2022-12-16 05:18:58] <Waaghbafet> just think though. if she can straight up kill 2 units every time - wouldnt that be OP ?
[2022-12-16 05:18:59] <Jfyemch> @Jenazad no mage playthrough? I think ER did the mage play-style justice
[2022-12-16 05:19:01] <Xamess> mine kills everything with portrait tbh but i think time matter could be better ok
[2022-12-16 05:19:01] <TheRealestRj> Is the dmg difference that big with portrait?
[2022-12-16 05:19:03] <%TheGameplayHub> @imcharmanderrr NOWAY green cidd and Melissa better?

[2022-12-16 05:27:13] <@%+imCharmanderrr> thats why every single new dps is a ranger or has evasion or some bullshit mech to let them survive
[2022-12-16 05:27:15] <+Viperfalcon> gizelle a good pull for FTP silver RTA?

[2022-12-16 05:27:20] <%TheGameplayHub> what's the most efficient way to do these repeat phases is it on hard or normal?
[2022-12-16 05:27:31] <Xamess> @DivinityOfPhilosophy 50% crit rate KEKW
[2022-12-16 05:27:37] <blacklotus055> Even ervalen has thick shield and do much more dmg than giselle at least in my case :((
[2022-12-16 05:27:52] <thedefault888> Normal is the best point per energy value
[2022-12-16 05:28:04] <Seanroni> wait can karina oneshot a squishy with just rocketpunch s1? @Jenazad
[2022-12-16 05:28:05] <Seanroni> LOL
[2022-12-16 05:28:15] <@%+imCharmanderrr> and zio is made to take first turn and then protect himself

[2022-12-16 05:28:18] <Waaghbafet> look at zio. he wants first turn lol

[2022-12-16 05:28:35] <+shaolex> a bruiser without crit stats
[2022-12-16 05:28:41] <furao_ousado> karina has the best looking s3 out of the group
[2022-12-16 05:29:04] <%nocting> I like Winter's the most
[2022-12-16 05:29:08] <%inferno2918> @Jenazad question why does a lot of people only want to build karina as tank, cant she go cdmg?
[2022-12-16 05:29:09] <%shinzen_sho> deadass
[2022-12-16 05:29:09] <%TheGameplayHub> I need a SSS Karina with her MLB artifact
[2022-12-16 05:29:09] <@%+imCharmanderrr> literally you can look at ANY dps they make, and if they are not a ranger or have no self protection, there is a huge likelihood they are horrible

[2022-12-16 05:37:08] <Seanroni> i feel like a majority of players can slam flan actually in lower brackets
[2022-12-16 05:37:10] <Puffypuffs> just build a 300 emilia without frenzy speed UrTrippin
[2022-12-16 05:37:11] <@%+imCharmanderrr> also if u fight someone with immu on every anti cleave unit like me, flan is free win
[2022-12-16 05:37:12] <Seanroni> cuz no one speed contests
[2022-12-16 05:37:13] <Seanroni> KEKW

[2022-12-16 05:37:58] <Seanroni> KEKW
[2022-12-16 05:37:59] <@%+imCharmanderrr> immu on anti cleave units is super broken, especially for units like armin and sage
[2022-12-16 05:38:04] <tunococman> effect resistane scaling sounds interesting tbh, not too broken but might have an iche
[2022-12-16 05:38:08] <Sektor2350> Scales of speed rng KEKW

[2022-12-16 05:38:58] <Seanroni> i like how people say hwa was a necessary evil for aravi when hwa killed everything that wasnt aravi...
[2022-12-16 05:38:59] <%+IronTetsuo> I agree. the Hwayoung neft was awesome and needed.
[2022-12-16 05:39:01] <%inferno2918> maybe her S1 multis are crazy

[2022-12-16 05:49:54] <ropesander> They were my only picks.

[2022-12-16 05:50:10] <%shinzen_sho> next collab will be with Donald Trump KKona
[2022-12-16 05:50:11] <blacklotus055> Yeah i thought they gonna pull kizuna ai v2 KEKW
[2022-12-16 05:50:19] <%inferno2918> man G G collab needs a huge rework, all units are bad FeelsWeirdMan
[2022-12-16 05:50:28] <ropesander> Trippin
[2022-12-16 05:50:30] <TheRealestRj> Regardless of how hard giselle is to use i think its cool they tried something new ok
[2022-12-16 05:50:37] <%inferno2918> elphelt kinda
[2022-12-16 05:50:41] <z0r0shi> do u think this is the best collab so far in terms of power ?
[2022-12-16 05:50:42] <frostfirefox_> i hope future collabs do the collab bookmark thing instead of making free 5*s that suck
[2022-12-16 05:50:45] <thedefault888> I think sg kinda forced themselves to have to make appealing characters, or else there would probably be a lot of hate due to the kpop fans
[2022-12-16 05:50:48] <jek_lim> this collab didnt have any free units and thats ok they gave a lot of resources and pulls honestly
[2022-12-16 05:50:52] <topheavyzer0> Elphelt, Dizzy and Baiken is usable right? in PVE
[2022-12-16 05:51:01] <dinomisa> Will she be stuck as a GW unit?
[2022-12-16 05:51:02] <%sikon66> sup Jena

[2022-12-16 05:51:17] <@%ProfessorBloak> I knew nothing about aespa before this collab, but this has become my fav collab with the units and their designs. I'm an aespa stan now
[2022-12-16 05:51:27] <ropesander> Karina S3 kinda rip off of Winter S3.
[2022-12-16 05:51:27] <+MisterTwinkle> Speaking of Aespa, did you hear about that one kpop group, called xgalx? Their cypher rap tape was pretty fire.

[2022-12-16 06:49:06] <%Infiniteskywalker3> @nocting yeh i think destina took a likeness to ruele because she respected her or sumn. destina was a star/ god or sumn

[2022-12-16 06:49:07] <%nocting> !yulha
[2022-12-16 06:49:07] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-16 07:20:23] <%$ML_Zahhak> i think the meta is in a good place, odd picks like Yulha are useable, aras and arowell are still great and fcc is still seen too.

[2022-12-16 07:31:42] <evildungeonmasteromegalul> @Jenazad i've in a dungeon for 10000 years,why are u first picking Yulha? ICANT

[2022-12-16 07:31:47] <%+demo__0> irs decent considering uts a minigame in a game
[2022-12-16 07:31:52] <@%+imCharmanderrr> !yulha
[2022-12-16 07:31:52] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-16 07:31:59] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-16 07:32:01] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2022-12-16 07:44:58] <topheavyzer0> @ML_Zahhak nah she sucks. Mori Calliope and Kiara are infinitely better than her. Even Ina has more use in PVE than Gura in CS Sadge
[2022-12-16 07:45:01] <%nocting> kaci has a niche but she's kind of overshadowed by Serapel and other tanks like Esterosa
[2022-12-16 07:45:01] <%$ML_Zahhak> if Gawr Gura is good in pvp i was gonna whale on her then stomp kids in pvp with her

[2022-12-16 07:54:42] <thedefault888> From my perspective as someone who doesn’t know account value, lacari would be whaling for characters and spending even more money + start from 0 if he did want to start a new acc. But ig account values are lower since maybe the market is small
[2022-12-16 07:54:46] <Biako11> @Jenazad i'm with you on this one. 3k is too littel imo for that acc. the units alone would total more than that

[2022-12-16 07:54:57] <%doken1992> 2k is cheap ... u could never get that on urself for that money. if there are better deals out there then those are steals

Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-16 09:28:53] <SozNerfed> !yulha
[2022-12-16 09:28:53] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3
[2022-12-16 09:28:54] <Crinnit> @Jenazad How is Giselle? Judging from the title not good

[2022-12-16 09:29:01] <%$TenebaeSimp> !stene
[2022-12-16 09:29:01] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-16 09:29:09] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2022-12-16 09:40:53] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-16 11:41:42] <%thedefault888> Shimenawa is pretty good on scaramouche, his burst is pretty weak. Also grinding for these artifacts is gonna be an over time thing. You still need talent and boss mats right?

[2022-12-16 12:17:09] <ThirteenLantern> next is nahida ok
[2022-12-16 12:17:16] <Greendii> in my opinion its raiden, but thats just me
[2022-12-16 12:17:25] <%thedefault888> Raiden would probably be better in terms of value for anyone that wanted to speed bosses/abyss for 36*
[2022-12-16 12:17:35] <!%Cooowop> raiden is awesome Binoculous
[2022-12-16 12:17:51] <ThirteenLantern> Raiden plus nahida is super op ok
[2022-12-16 12:18:10] <%thedefault888> Raiden xingqiu (Yelan if you have her) Xiangling and Bennett is still like the greatest team in the game
[2022-12-16 12:18:17] <%thedefault888> Because Xiangling and Bennett are op

[2022-12-16 12:19:31] <@%ProfessorBloak> I know why UHM
[2022-12-16 12:19:34] <albracket> Yea I do all of the events but never use fragile unless I need something NOW
[2022-12-16 12:19:40] <%Code_Cubster> so is this all genshin ends up being? just these challenges?
[2022-12-16 12:19:54] <%thedefault888> @code_cubster well there’s story and events

[2022-12-16 12:20:05] <HexWan> i used all my saved up fragile when sumeru came out
[2022-12-16 12:20:11] <%thedefault888> But yeah Genshin is a side game, so it’s mainly just daily commissions and resin
[2022-12-16 12:20:18] <%teevivi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916796458789912579/1053270317914660904/image.png wtf

[2022-12-16 12:22:10] <%MeechieDarkko> @Jenazad Genshin devs treat fragile resin like its gold dust or some shit
[2022-12-16 12:22:20] <@%ProfessorBloak> Woah I can tell ive been out of the loop for genshin because i have never seen her before
[2022-12-16 12:22:21] <danise36> slap anything with highest ER ever on faruzan

[2022-12-16 12:22:56] <%thedefault888> You can actually build her for dmg if you wanted, but her main gimmick is buffing the team
[2022-12-16 12:23:05] <%MeechieDarkko> @Jenazad theyre in a corporate meeting like...  Developer: should we give them all 2 fragile resin?  CEO: No way they'll become way too powerful
[2022-12-16 12:23:07] <MikonPls> c6 doesn't want as much er%, so you can build her as sub-dps
[2022-12-16 12:23:07] <$yamaarashi287> yea a lot of er too
[2022-12-16 12:23:08] <HexWan> high ER and crit rate for favonius?

[2022-12-16 12:24:52] <%MeechieDarkko> its worth but you need a ton keep one extra yeah
[2022-12-16 12:24:53] <$yamaarashi287> na, refine all
[2022-12-16 12:25:01] <danise36> worth, fav is useless without r5

[2022-12-16 12:25:12] <MikonPls> having at least two copies of favonius weapons is always nice, but refines are also valuable
[2022-12-16 12:25:15] <%thedefault888> The only thing you don’t refine is 5 star weapons as non whale
[2022-12-16 12:25:25] <%MeechieDarkko> @MikonPls this
[2022-12-16 12:25:40] <Razor7th> that's good or fav
[2022-12-16 12:25:43] <%thedefault888> Favonius and sacrificial are the only 4 stars that benefit greatly from refinements

[2022-12-16 12:32:19] <%thedefault888> Jena what you can do though, is farm for talent mats in the days they are available, then you can artifact grind on days when the talent mats aren’t available
[2022-12-16 12:32:20] <%Bolvarin> @ProfessorBloak because people kept spamming it after 1st anni fiasco
[2022-12-16 12:32:26] <MikonPls> that emote alone convinced me i dont mind getting spooked by qiqi QiqiFallen

[2022-12-16 12:33:39] <HexWan> yeah 21 crit dmg on a CR circlet
[2022-12-16 12:33:46] <Kagome_TI> the crit dmg is good tho
[2022-12-16 12:33:53] <%jensen_> thats a ton of hp
[2022-12-16 12:33:56] <real_dino> golden wolflord the new boss in floor 12 Aware
[2022-12-16 12:34:00] <+F2P__btw> he does
[2022-12-16 12:34:06] <danise36> anemo
[2022-12-16 12:34:07] <MrUniCornePower> anemo
[2022-12-16 12:34:08] <MikonPls> @real_dino 11-3 with four flying bastards was more annoying KEKW overall I feel difficulty is about the same as previous
[2022-12-16 12:34:08] <Kagome_TI> anemo dmg YEP
[2022-12-16 12:34:08] <%Bolvarin> anemo dmg
[2022-12-16 12:34:09] <%thedefault888> You want anemo dmg cup
[2022-12-16 12:34:35] <MrUniCornePower> that cup is fine
[2022-12-16 12:34:39] <%thedefault888> You can even do 2x 2pc atk% sets
[2022-12-16 12:34:41] <danise36> walmart Zio doesnt need EM
[2022-12-16 12:34:46] <%thedefault888> He’s really flexible
[2022-12-16 12:34:50] <HexWan> don't worry too much about set bonus if all you need is to stack dmg
[2022-12-16 12:35:19] <MrUniCornePower> imo if you wanderer artis/talents suck its better to play him as a driver in fishl/beidou teams on vv KEKW
[2022-12-16 12:35:27] <%Bolvarin> you dont need 4p vv on him, think you can have 4p vv on faruzan
