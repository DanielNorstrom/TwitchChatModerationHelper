[2022-12-17 03:33:57] <@%Pallydan9K> So apparently when you go to NG+, you can run through lava and other things that make you fat roll
[2022-12-17 03:34:24] <mylifical> touching the frenzied flame gives that effect too

[2022-12-17 03:43:02] <%Mercedes_FluffleBuns> How could you use moonveil as if it was acceptable in an honorable fight? Don’t you know it’s the best in slot katana because of how it shoots a projectile in addition to the physical slash? Not to mention the block cancels and reaction roll catches. Can you really stoop so low as to say you’re good when you’re using moonveil?

[2022-12-17 04:04:37] <MANSHREK> Does it have to be a fully charged R2 to true combo?
[2022-12-17 04:04:59] <Paintedphantoms> And the build I was using katars with barb roar is just broken now under 80 poise it’s a 5 hit true combo

[2022-12-17 04:09:06] <MANSHREK> Can they buff anything without having to nerf it the next patch
[2022-12-17 04:09:12] <mylifical> this is the same place i invade from

[2022-12-17 04:11:24] <Paintedphantoms> And it shortens the recovery.
[2022-12-17 04:11:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @Paintedphantoms I think it's fair because fists have less range than basically everything. You have to work harder than anyone else to get hits in.

[2022-12-17 05:04:40] <%Kaine_san> war cry gives big R2 slam and barbaric gives the combo iirc
[2022-12-17 05:04:43] <@%Pallydan9K> eh warcry is better on spears and halberds
[2022-12-17 05:05:00] <TheOneNamedQ> Barbaric gives multi-hit moves, Warcry gives single-hit moves.

[2022-12-17 05:05:13] <TheRealWholehorse> I think war cry is better on bigger weapons that don't get the fast combo from barbaric roar.
[2022-12-17 05:05:35] <SuburbanSocrates> War cry changes your regular R2 to a running R2, while Barbaric Roar gives you a totally new R2 combo. How effective they are depends on the weapon.
[2022-12-17 05:05:36] <%Evil_on_Paper> Both roars are +7.5% damage, and a bit extra strength scaling
[2022-12-17 05:05:41] <@%Pallydan9K> Braggart's roar vs Warcry are the same ones

[2022-12-17 05:18:32] <@%Pallydan9K> eh those are pretty common
[2022-12-17 05:18:37] <hugostefaniv> @Evil_on_Paper yeah, it popped in at the very last sec
[2022-12-17 05:18:45] <@%Pallydan9K> what about sword dance
[2022-12-17 05:18:51] <Henpemaz> On low levels I was having fun with either Fire Strike or Sword Dance on scythes. Not great, but alright
[2022-12-17 05:19:05] <DragonLordRossolon> Phantom slash
[2022-12-17 05:19:05] <@%Pallydan9K> usually I hit them once, wait a third of a second, and then sword dance
[2022-12-17 05:19:11] <%Evil_on_Paper> OH! Double slash too
[2022-12-17 05:19:16] <chicasloco11433> The faith scythe is pretty good cuz of the aow
[2022-12-17 05:19:27] <%Evil_on_Paper> fair
[2022-12-17 05:19:32] <@%Pallydan9K> double slash is fun but it's not as good as sword dance

[2022-12-17 05:19:45] <Henpemaz> Sword Dance for whatever freaking reason gets the greatest multiplier on Greatswords (but not on scythes) and it's disgusting

[2022-12-17 05:34:12] <%KungFuAndrew> @axenred No, it does not increase range. Your opponent may have just had high ping

[2022-12-17 05:34:17] <Henpemaz> So when you cold-infuse the Antspur, it's Rot buildup actually goes up instead of down. Any other instances of wrong infusions like that?

You are the reason fans of these games are mocked. You don't have the self awareness to realize this, but one day you might

[2022-12-17 06:51:08] <%$Noob_Almost> @LuminArcTech i like melee, but you just hold attack and they work through a combo, it doesn't feel great combined with the slow speed. idk how magic or ranged is though
[2022-12-17 06:51:22] <%$Noob_Almost> err i like melee in general, not in the game
[2022-12-17 06:51:37] <HxHPeakFiction> I hecking love this game BatChest

[2022-12-17 07:06:30] <%LuminArcTech> i think they didn't increase the energy use as the wall increased
[2022-12-17 07:06:45] <ImperialDuck_> the wall size doesn't increase energy cost, nope
[2022-12-17 07:07:03] <ImperialDuck_> matter of fact they technically lowered it since the ele dmg DID increase mana cost
[2022-12-17 07:07:08] <Daetaelas> this is why you don't give oro builds NotLikeThis
