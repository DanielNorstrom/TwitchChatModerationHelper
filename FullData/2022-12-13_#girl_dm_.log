[2022-12-13 18:49:39] <%+Wedgehead99> @GAhlekzis girldmLUL we're all gonna be broke after this stream I feel
[2022-12-13 18:49:48] <%$Layzay73> @GAhlekzis that's the plan
[2022-12-13 18:49:52] <%fotoply> @Layzay73 I just looked at mine, and it says I modded a channel.. I have no idea what channel that is supposed to have been girldmLUL
[2022-12-13 18:50:02] <%Sun_Rendered> im sitting on my points like a dragons hoard
[2022-12-13 18:50:03] <%$Bazeio> @wedgehead99 thats the point
[2022-12-13 18:50:12] <%Sun_Rendered> idk if i CAN part with any points
[2022-12-13 18:50:23] <GAhlekzis> Well since the 10 minute nyan doesnt exist anymore (understandably) my reason to hoard points is also gone @Wedgehead99 So its fine ^^
[2022-12-13 18:50:29] <%$Layzay73> @fotoply I am only modded in Giri's channel and it says I am modded in 3 artyblueShrug
[2022-12-13 18:50:55] <%+Wedgehead99> @Bazeio but then how will we afford an unlimited headpat stream? girldmSad
[2022-12-13 18:50:57] <%fotoply> Lul, wonder if there are some channels out there trying to get viewers by modding randomly girldmHuh
[2022-12-13 18:51:06] <birtwal_bryan> LUL
[2022-12-13 18:51:19] <%$Layzay73> @fotoply But you don't get notified when you get Modded
[2022-12-13 18:51:32] <%Sun_Rendered> time to set layzay as a mod
[2022-12-13 18:51:48] <%$Bazeio> @wedgehead99 thats exactly the point of it girldmLUL
[2022-12-13 18:51:57] <%$Layzay73> @Sun_Rendered auteruWheeze GIRI DID EXACTLY THAT
[2022-12-13 18:52:01] <%fotoply> @Layzay73 True, just speculating, since it also says I spent 8 hours modding, which indicates I might have been watching a stream after a raid while I was asleep girldmLUL
[2022-12-13 18:52:09] <%$Layzay73> auteruWheeze AND FORGOT THAT I HAVE NUMBERS IN MY NAME

[2022-12-13 18:55:02] <%mattmk_ll> what did Giri do?
[2022-12-13 18:55:34] <%$Layzay73> @mattmk_ll Instead of modding me "Layzay73" she modded "Layzay"
[2022-12-13 18:56:04] <%clockworkcontrivance> oh yeah the mod stat for the twitch recap is definitely broken lol
[2022-12-13 18:56:15] <%clockworkcontrivance> it says i modded for 7 channels

[2022-12-13 18:57:29] <%clockworkcontrivance> of course. we have to let her progress some so the save deletion hurts more
[2022-12-13 18:57:32] <%fotoply> Well, we shall try out best to behave! Our best isn't very good as you know
[2022-12-13 18:57:43] <@%KiraFA37> Well, just behave tactically.
[2022-12-13 18:58:05] <%clockworkcontrivance> FIVE whole minutes of no weapons? lol
[2022-12-13 18:58:11] <%fotoply> I just barely have enough points to delete the save twice, so I think I'll go for the others mostly :P

[2022-12-13 19:55:03] <%AmenoLT> Wait we are playing with keyboard and mouse???
[2022-12-13 19:55:05] <david67sp> Hey, so are you having some fun on this game?
[2022-12-13 19:55:17] <%ynlokk> oh well, no inventory drop then
[2022-12-13 19:55:17] <matthiastein> Oh possible simple or sort, it'd be drop or destroy i think?
[2022-12-13 19:55:17] <%Mr_Smileyy4> probably have to unequip what your dorpping
[2022-12-13 19:55:18] <@%zMiyuZ> well you dropped one item
[2022-12-13 19:55:22] <+LethalLucidity> Really looks like it won't let you drop your starting items. Maybe it's a failsafe for new players or something.
[2022-12-13 19:55:24] <Tykirou> Press E instead of right click when you choose an item
[2022-12-13 19:55:25] <%vic_weave> Internet says left click and "leave"?
[2022-12-13 19:55:25] <Hystabec> select item > click ok > discard (I think)
[2022-12-13 19:55:27] <%clockworkcontrivance> if there's no "leave" option you can't drop it yet
[2022-12-13 19:55:27] <%+Insayden> Try E on it? It maybe gives a different context menu. According to a reddit thread from 7 years ago girldmLUL
[2022-12-13 19:55:48] <%fotoply> Press E on it
[2022-12-13 19:55:49] <%+ChrisMackGames> Google says : Go to inventory and select the item you want to drop and select leave, some items can't be dropped.

[2022-12-13 19:55:53] <saitax_07> I think you cant drop weapons, anything else should be dropable

[2022-12-13 19:56:08] <%+nikromancer01> It'd be in the inventory menu if anything
[2022-12-13 19:56:08] <Tykirou> Press E its a diff menu @girl_dm_
[2022-12-13 19:56:09] <%Moon_feral> I never drop items because I compulsively hoard everything girldmLUL I don't even know how
[2022-12-13 19:56:12] <cigarenjoyer> You drop items on bag not equipement
[2022-12-13 19:56:12] <%+Insayden> @girl_dm_ try pressing E on the item
[2022-12-13 19:56:12] <%$Bazeio> @ofjehutyv2 its one handed controller
[2022-12-13 19:56:15] <+speedygonzalesqd> You can unequip without clicking on it first btw
[2022-12-13 19:56:16] <%Zoiyya> I think it's not called drop in dark souls, some items can't be dropped, for all others it should show a "leave" option in your inventory

[2022-12-13 21:01:11] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2022-12-13 21:03:47] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2022-12-13 23:11:16] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain
[2022-12-13 23:11:24] <%iLovePork> Just wash your pets paws after a walk
[2022-12-13 23:11:26] <%SideShot_NL> !panic2
[2022-12-13 23:11:27] <@%^StreamElements> I am struck by Panic. My shackles are shattered by Panic, and it grants me total emancipation. I embrace my Panic. It envelops and consumes me. Through it, I become Panic Personified! And where Panic thrives, there grows Freedom! But we must accept: The cat-streamer is gone forever.
[2022-12-13 23:11:29] <Sir_Khris> theres no need to panic... yet

[2022-12-13 23:38:27] <BluABK> Your user data generally drowns out location based, if you log out (or open youtube in incognito mode or something) it should give you a clearer picture of what parts of it might be location based, maybe.
[2022-12-13 23:38:29] <fir3_leviathan> @Bazeio depends, if your ISP is an (I won't say the profanity here) yes. Otherwise a "good" ISP has to provide a single static IP to each customer, should be a right IMO
