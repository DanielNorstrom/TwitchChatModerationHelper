[2022-12-22 12:01:39] <OhMySquall> lightning was for lulus onion knight right?
[2022-12-22 12:01:44] <%Neobullseye> Lightning Evasion is mostly just exhausting to me. I needed to take a break every so many dodges.
[2022-12-22 12:01:45] <%+vxxyman> Now do it over a 100 times :)
[2022-12-22 12:01:48] <%+Toby_1_Kenobi> The trophies for this remaster are infamously glitched, too. I got my trophy for beating the game while in Calm Lands. Then I beat Penance and that trophy didn't pop...
[2022-12-22 12:01:52] <%Neobullseye> Did that once, never again.
[2022-12-22 12:01:54] <%TidusZecht> i think he's a little lacking in the brain department let alone the imagination bggHaa
[2022-12-22 12:02:10] <%Neobullseye> Oh, I knew the trick too
[2022-12-22 12:02:16] <%Neobullseye> It still required constant focus.
[2022-12-22 12:02:51] <%Neobullseye> And one slipup means you can start all over again. It's not /hard/ hard, just really exhausting.
[2022-12-22 12:03:01] <OhMySquall> 1st time i beat penance was with zanmato Kappa just to get the trophy
[2022-12-22 12:03:05] <%Neobullseye> Like I said. Once, and never again.

[2022-12-22 12:18:08] <%+ReimHikari> here it comes, the best scene from the game for me, and the most beautiful and sad
[2022-12-22 12:18:29] <%Neobullseye> I would have made Yakety Sax play if I had an alert for that.
[2022-12-22 12:18:33] <%Neobullseye> It fits. Somehow.
[2022-12-22 12:18:43] <%Lonefellow> @Smashtro I believe it's because they're a fishing village. And having it built from wood makes it easier to rebuild in case of an attack like this.

[2022-12-22 12:59:52] <+gemuotakuturner> auron, yuna and Lulu would probably best best.. magic damage, support and physical damage, probably could take out most enemies with that combo. set auron to cover a lot, build that limit and use it on enemies that would normally be too fast for him (or Lulu or attack Thier elemental weakness

[2022-12-22 14:10:45] <%iwatchgamessometimes> you have the option to use the inferior "advanced sphere grid"
[2022-12-22 14:11:01] <%Neobullseye> Depends on what you mean by "original" though.
[2022-12-22 14:11:03] <%iwatchgamessometimes> though if you played the international version
[2022-12-22 14:11:13] <%+spectr0nn> the advanced sphere grid was already in the international version. thats not remaster specfic
[2022-12-22 14:11:13] <%iwatchgamessometimes> then even that might not be new
[2022-12-22 14:11:18] <%Neobullseye> If your 'original' was the PAL version, that's pretty much the remaster already.
[2022-12-22 14:11:46] <%Sukyaki> oh so this game received the international treatment too
[2022-12-22 14:12:02] <%+spectr0nn> yes
[2022-12-22 14:12:03] <%Neobullseye> PAL had the special "Get Sphere" abilities, and yes, it also had a nerfed Quick hit.
[2022-12-22 14:12:13] <%Lonefellow> Wait, there are fouls in Blitzball? LUL
[2022-12-22 14:12:13] <%iwatchgamessometimes> oh and RNG isn't really possible to manipulate effectively without hax in this version

[2022-12-22 15:25:32] <%Neobullseye> Easy one there.
[2022-12-22 15:25:46] <%Selnica> and Riku is thief/chemist
[2022-12-22 15:25:49] <%IndecisiveNinja> Auron Samurai/Knight?

[2022-12-22 15:26:22] <%IndecisiveNinja> Lulu is Black Mage/Lewd

[2022-12-22 15:30:17] <%Selnica> ah ok, I was gonna ask redmage how, but FFXI would explain why i don,t see the red mage. I don,t know FF11

[2022-12-22 15:32:22] <%iwatchgamessometimes> drain is super low level, and aspir isn't much higher, so subjob its easy enough to get...but subjobs don't really define the theme of a class :P

[2022-12-22 17:19:13] <%DeckhardAura> I think the damage limit thing is tied to your celestial weapons.

[2022-12-22 19:49:10] <%+Vrogarth> ah, ok thx
[2022-12-22 19:49:21] <@%BGG02> @PhauxCrafts not quite
[2022-12-22 19:49:37] <@%BGG02> sadness makes you take 30% less physical damage and reduces limit gauge growth by 50%
[2022-12-22 19:49:46] <%+Vrogarth> everytime i play ff7 i put fury on characters
[2022-12-22 19:49:46] <@%BGG02> it does not reduce damage dealth
[2022-12-22 19:50:03] <@%BGG02> fury doubles limit gain but gives you -50% accuracy to *EVERYTHING*
[2022-12-22 19:50:05] <%+PhauxCrafts> ah thanks @bgg02 I always get that one kinda correct lol

[2022-12-22 19:50:32] <@%BGG02> I did that when I first played too though because I thought limits were the best damage
[2022-12-22 19:50:40] <%+Vrogarth> @BGG02 yes i know that but idk sadness
[2022-12-22 19:50:40] <%+Vrogarth> thx
[2022-12-22 19:51:03] <@%BGG02> sadness + backrow = you don't take physical damage anymore pretty much lol

[2022-12-22 23:23:56] <%TidusZecht> this is a rerun while seven's offline for his christmas festivities over the next couple days
[2022-12-22 23:24:22] <%TidusZecht> as such, it's showing as far back as it would need to be so that the last rerun ends just before the next stream
