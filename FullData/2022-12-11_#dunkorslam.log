[2022-12-11 06:37:37] <Syfygamer> I dont know if it was covid i got but there was a week long period of time where it felt as though my blood were on fire. This was maybe 2 - 4 months before i was able to get the covid shot. I had to get it to get a job as a technician.

Over time, he found himself falling in love with the spider and would often spend hours in the garden, admiring its beauty. He even named the spider Uguu and would talk to it as if it were a dear friend. The old man was surprised by the depth of his feelings for the spider, but he didn't mind. He was just happy to have found love in his old age.

[2022-12-11 08:20:02] <Kieran2567a> @nohugsforyou1 Spreading out the spells in spell slots makes no difference, the light spell is a modifier which grabs the spell right to it, which happens to be the first spell in the wand, thus spell wrapping. I can link a tutorial to it
[2022-12-11 08:20:05] <stylish2> he meant the other modifier i think

[2022-12-11 08:20:28] <nohugsforyou1> By that I mean putting the light to the right with empty slots between it and the other spells
[2022-12-11 08:20:33] <%DeriumEnvy> Neat, we get the same rant twice in a row!
[2022-12-11 08:20:34] <%+davyt20> leaving gaps between spells i think is what he meant, it has no impact on the wand .
[2022-12-11 08:20:41] <Mayerling> @nohugsforyou1 that does nothing
[2022-12-11 08:20:44] <%+shmameron> @nohugsforyou1 the empty slots don't matter at all

[2022-12-11 08:24:37] <%+Flupperich> @bjortholomew It only costs the thing you cast again. So if you have only a mana + chainsaw at the start, it would only cost the mana OF the chainsaw., not of the entire wand

[2022-12-11 08:24:37] <%+shmameron> so if you cast every again with wrapping it's still casting the same mana cost on the second cast

[2022-12-11 08:25:11] <+DaltonFischer> does there need to be an empty spell slot on the wand to wrap? or if the light is the last spell on wand will it still wrap
[2022-12-11 08:25:12] <%+shmameron> really this is better explained by talking about the wand like a deck of cards since that's how it's implemented

[2022-12-11 08:28:53] <%First_Mesmer> @DaltonFischer Putting any spell modifier (like light) on the end of a wand just has the wand wrap back around to look for something to modify.  It should wrap as long as it's actually separate from whatever was before it.

[2022-12-11 08:29:33] <%First_Mesmer> It has to actually be separate though, if you have a double spell in a trigger, but just one spell there, it ends up applying the light to the one spell you cast in that package, it doesn't wrap all on it's own.

[2022-12-11 08:35:24] <%brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam why it feels less of "casting add mana twice" and more "casting spark bolt half the time"
[2022-12-11 08:35:27] VIEWERS: 716
[2022-12-11 08:35:43] <%+lawthahost> try switching out some diggin with sparks and see if its too much
[2022-12-11 08:35:47] <%+shmameron> you're not casting it every frame which is why
[2022-12-11 08:36:05] <%+shmameron> you have 0.05 cast delay now
[2022-12-11 08:36:28] <djlights1> add the light on the triplicate tho
[2022-12-11 08:36:33] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> add a reduce spread

[2022-12-11 08:36:53] <%+Flupperich> @brbrmensch Because that is a slightly less correct way of describing it. "add mana twice" is more correct because per 1 refresh of the wand, it gets cast twice. While spark bolt is still cast every wand refresh
[2022-12-11 08:36:55] <Mayerling> try 2. so you get the stacked crits

It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks™; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs

[2022-12-11 11:44:57] <StrangeFlyingContraption> In an orange hoodie, Dunk did stand, His heart full of love for a spider so grand. With eight legs and a web so fine, He could not help but call her mine. With a gentle touch and a loving embrace, Dunk held his spider with such grace. For in her eyes, he found true delight, And knew that their love would last through the night.

[2022-12-11 12:04:49] <pood707> In the garden, Dunk and Alias did play, With worms wriggling in the dirt all day. Their love was strong and true, And together, they made a perfect crew.  With gentle hands, they held each other tight, And shared a love that shone so bright. In each other's arms, they felt complete, And nothing could tear them from this sweet.  Though some may think it odd, Their love for each other was never flawed. For in each other, they found true joy, And together, they would never be destroyed

You have the upper body and you don't have the legs, you got a problem building the lower body... No, you don't understand. You have the upper body, but you don't have the lower body, you got a problem building downstairs. You got the up- legs on the bottom, it is easier to build on the top, so you don't have much as a problem. Yeah.

[2022-12-11 13:57:03] <%rav_00> @Engreth_ there's no spin, my dude. there's no puzzle either. the socially inept part was thinking that you could publicly confront people that possibly felt uncomfortable and continue insisting as if you're a detective trying to catch a criminal. (if anything, you could've privately messaged them and briefly asked if they're comfortable talking about it.)
