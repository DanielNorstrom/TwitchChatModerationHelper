[2022-12-19 01:02:21] <%Yomigaeru> so 3/9 tiles are your safespots - these 3 tiles are in a row - you have to move to the safe tiles 3 times (they change 3 times in total)
[2022-12-19 01:03:34] <%Yomigaeru> should I send you an overview with the different shapes so you know which one you got?

[2022-12-19 01:10:21] <%Yomigaeru> and ask them to ping you the safespot again maybe
[2022-12-19 01:10:53] <%Yomigaeru> so usually you dont have to move at all while all her orbs are flying around, after she's done with that you go in the mid and look out for your 1st safe tiles
[2022-12-19 01:11:02] <%Yomigaeru> from there on you move to them like you did before

[2022-12-19 02:22:14] <JockerRL> depends on how any people are left, since scouting can also be done with 3 lets say
[2022-12-19 02:22:20] <JockerRL> if you split the sides a bit
[2022-12-19 02:22:22] <%polig> ppl without black orbs needs to be ''saved'' by scouted counter/stagger or they die if they dont collect orb from one of these mechs

[2022-12-19 02:46:08] <+kleinaz> tbh they should have used inana for 1st shapes from start

[2022-12-19 02:47:02] <%Yomigaeru> @kleinaz using inana in general there is not the best idea, just in case you need to do the mech at 28 without and are not used to it, would be pretty sure a wipe
