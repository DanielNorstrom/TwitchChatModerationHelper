[2022-12-09 16:33:06] <+YukiBY> are meldonins the best way to level immunity?
[2022-12-09 16:33:13] <baboosky> its allowing the adenoscene cleaar out of your body so you dont get jitters and crash hard from caffeine you should look up andrew hubermans podcast specifically the one on caffeine
[2022-12-09 16:33:13] <%mita418> i heard even coffee can screw with your brain unless you workout close to waking up.
[2022-12-09 16:33:20] <%+AtlasZX10R> your doctor tells you to do that but wakes up and immediately guzzles black coffee when they get up and pops a vicodin
[2022-12-09 16:33:22] <$cravenLX> @yukiby yes but max energy’s are cheaper
[2022-12-09 16:33:23] <%mita418> gotta give your mind time to do it's job i guess!
[2022-12-09 16:33:23] <%+pocketacez_> just pop a propital irl

[2022-12-09 16:33:39] <@%dodger52tv> adenosine needs to do work for first 90 minutes  when youre awake and you wont get that mid afternoon crash
[2022-12-09 16:33:42] <%RegHex> yeah i get nic and coffee in my body immediately
[2022-12-09 16:33:45] <m0choman> it takes 90 minutes for the chemicals in your body to basically unbind from your body so caffeine and whatever you take can bind to those recepetors. it also helps with not having that caffeine crash
[2022-12-09 16:33:58] <%NeverNewd> my doctor said to give no fucks for the first 3 hours of my day. ITS WORKING GREAT! LUL

[2022-12-09 16:34:42] <CarterPro> crazy you're talking about this Joe Rogan just talked about this on one of his podcasts
[2022-12-09 16:34:42] <%Drolyx> If you wait to drink coffee for a few hours after you wake up you avoid the crash

[2022-12-09 17:48:09] <%+RING3RR> @iSnipeLikeJesus i personally love night raids. they make the game feel different but yeah, seems like to many people are scared of them or just dont like them so you dont get as much PVP at night. i wish more people were willing to do night raids. sadge

[2022-12-09 17:50:17] <%stribbits> yeah 100$  and no 25k fee is a Uber deal
[2022-12-09 17:50:18] <+FalconiumTV> Over 1000 won’t even make a difference
[2022-12-09 17:50:20] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @WillerZ Most new installations they wave the installation fee's. It's basically a gesture of good faith to keep you around.

[2022-12-09 17:51:39] <+BigBoyBruce420> Well dedicated fiber is expensive, surely they’re not installing an entire fiber ring just for your house right? I’m curious because I’m a fiber engineer. Lol
[2022-12-09 17:51:45] <+snipehunter42> router/firewall too

[2022-12-09 17:51:59] <%+RING3RR> @iSnipeLikeJesus i can see that. i personally dont experience players like that much at night. still feels like i run into those players more during day raids than i do at night. staying mobile helps because they will miss shots and give you more time to react. i dont sit still and clear every nook and cranny before i loot
[2022-12-09 17:51:59] <%BobbySlaya> i thought most network cards already support upto 10gbit
[2022-12-09 17:52:06] <spectre___sec92> my dad used to repair and install fiber optic lines for the city of indianapolis, that shit is expensive af man. 1-12in section is about a 1/4 mil to repair. fking nuts lol

[2022-12-09 17:58:50] <+BigBoyBruce420> I don’t know where those costs are coming from. Residential fiber in rural Alabama is $100 a month. That’s insane.
[2022-12-09 17:58:51] <HONEYxxo> When’s ya birthday?!
[2022-12-09 17:58:51] <Maaack3> In Sweden 100 mb fiber is like 30 $ a month lol.
[2022-12-09 17:58:52] <fulmetaltartan> even 300 wow
[2022-12-09 17:58:52] <+JOExNOTxEXOTIC> @somnydays Yes. It’s 1,000/month. Dedicated line straight to hub. For my business.

[2022-12-09 17:58:57] <%SaucyKOS> Business and residential internet is the same. They just use the name to charge differently

[2022-12-09 18:00:03] <%+glocknessmonstattv> The fiber we just laid for AT&T in a  residential area costs $100-$120 a month for a GB up of FIber.

[2022-12-09 18:00:22] <%nog00d4u> Business stuff is marked up compared to residential due to SLAs
