[2023-01-04 14:53:30] <%osthytakesdebit> wtb eruption nerf
[2023-01-04 14:53:33] <%AMGC7> Rotten Fields is quality over quantity, but it relies on survivors being somewhat efficient so the limited amount of loops doesnt bite them mid-late game
[2023-01-04 14:53:34] <nice_feed> are her blink attacks will be special
[2023-01-04 14:53:42] <MonsterKillxDD> I miss playing old crack billy
[2023-01-04 14:53:43] <+HolyPeanut123> @nice_feed yes

[2023-01-04 14:53:53] <neopolydora> @fliperotchy fair but the problem is that there‚Äôs like 20 poorly designed maps, eyrie being changed is a step to a higher ratio of balanced maps, it doesn‚Äôt take a big brain to see that LUL
[2023-01-04 14:53:54] <imkloon> honestly where is the freaking eruption nerf
[2023-01-04 14:54:05] <Saberistcool> the nerfs were really necessary

[2023-01-04 14:54:18] <%+prized_1> Do they only work on couple killers per patch?
[2023-01-04 14:54:18] <!%YourFriendLumpy> "reduce audible range of blinks to 40 meters"
[2023-01-04 14:54:19] <%+Fliperotchy> @neopolydora 1 perk change impacts all games on all maps for all sides, all surv and all killer. 1 map change helps out 1/55 games

[2023-01-04 14:54:34] <@%animeangel09> !countdown
[2023-01-04 14:54:34] <@%^Nightbot> PTB comes out in 2 hours 5 minutes 25 seconds
[2023-01-04 14:54:35] <%+magic_mat1> Barely a nerf if you are good with her imo
[2023-01-04 14:54:44] <khokhah_> @Nightbot OMG
[2023-01-04 14:54:44] <%+DemonicGhost27_> her attacks will also be counted as special for blinks
[2023-01-04 14:54:50] <%+Fliperotchy> @neopolydora they just fixed Eyrie but the newest map Borgo is still busted so.... -1 bad map and +1 bad map. as they continue to do
[2023-01-04 14:54:58] <sosadheart> are u gonna play the ptb?
[2023-01-04 14:55:02] <%SkeleOnPC> The SoloQ buffs will hopefully be good
[2023-01-04 14:55:07] <SupaSuupa> they should nerf pig again for a laugh
[2023-01-04 14:55:07] <OmgAreUNoob> doesn't seem like a huge nerf tho
[2023-01-04 14:55:09] <neopolydora> @fliperotchy it is weird they‚Äôre not merging eruption yet, it is obviously broken and yh no shit Borgia broken duh
[2023-01-04 14:55:12] <NyquilEvangelist> words test words
[2023-01-04 14:55:15] <%+magic_mat1> I cant wait to try Nurse on the PTB
[2023-01-04 14:55:28] <FrostWalk3r_> will they even fix eyrie is the real question
[2023-01-04 14:55:29] <MonsterKillxDD> Like it felt so good playing with those addons as Billy. Also there was no overheat so you could chainsaw all the time
[2023-01-04 14:55:29] <khokhah_> when will the PTB be live?
[2023-01-04 14:55:35] <khokhah_> on game

[2023-01-04 14:55:39] <daboyergi> Wait when is the ptb gonna release
[2023-01-04 14:55:42] <+C0reSh0t> No sloppy butcher or jolt on nurse, so sad
[2023-01-04 14:55:42] <Jamm_ing> i hope they make her addons very fun and like memy
[2023-01-04 14:55:43] <Archaius> it also says her blink attack is a special attack now

[2023-01-04 15:20:30] <+jazzpurr14> artist's ability to zone is insane when you get better with her - although this map is stinky imo

[2023-01-04 15:20:42] <d4vldtebra> basekit blight is fine, the issue are his addons

[2023-01-04 15:32:57] <JulianCalabasas> @demented_hag I have absolutely no idea how BHVR perceives them. I would hope they look into decreasing the cooldowns and giving more interactions for Victor such as pinning down survivors so slugging isn't as encouraged and pick ups aren't as easy. Also maybe a buff to idle Charlotte I pray carniverisCry

[2023-01-04 15:37:48] <+JoeJoeLive> i'm sure they didn't get the feedback they wanted on the mori rework.  I figured they wanted to make the game scarier during halloween but didn't pass the reaction test

[2023-01-04 15:58:02] <randomman55555> Why not just rework nurse entirely. She has been the undisputed strongest killer since her release. Ppl will just run other meta perks and continue to subvert the looping mechanics of the game.
[2023-01-04 15:58:04] <stalemaccasfries> i stg rpd is shit that eventually u can‚Äôt even loop anymore u just need to take the killer to a corner
[2023-01-04 15:58:05] <@%^Nightbot> Remember that you're always loved, treasured, and accepted. Bad days will pass, but friends will always stay. hensL

[2023-01-04 15:59:48] <%+Fliperotchy> @asyashi idk how else to tell you this, but only lower to mid skill players think nurse is balanced. because they play against bad nurses. good ones, it doesn't matter where you are
[2023-01-04 15:59:49] <stalemaccasfries> why do people play trapper? he‚Äôs unfun to play against and even more unfun to play. makes no sense to me

[2023-01-04 16:05:35] <$Happygamer96> It‚Äôs technically classified as third-party software, so you can get banned for it
[2023-01-04 16:05:38] <stalemaccasfries> @jimmythornseed1 yes and if only things and lurch was a skin for the twins

[2023-01-04 16:13:32] <%Kapalina> @PurfectMeow nah, I got most Adepts on killer which make sense with controller.. and theyre making Adept easier FailFish .. and like over 85 percent steam achievements.. never realistic to complete them, wont play nurse enough to get her achievement and wont get iri rank (not gonna sink that much time into it)
[2023-01-04 16:13:32] <stalemaccasfries> ur outplaying me no fun

[2023-01-04 16:20:33] <!%Laser_EU> @MonsterKillxDD the reason why it happens more often with nurse than others is because on other killers almost noone tries to swing from pixel perfect max range lunge range - they usually just walk closer before swinging to be safe/sure - but on nurse ppl just swing if they might hit

[2023-01-04 16:23:04] <%ElectricLotus> the way the devs worded the wiggle update was so weird to me - like they were surprised you'd wiggle off
[2023-01-04 16:23:09] <MonsterKillxDD> @drindignation BloodTrail very nice
[2023-01-04 16:23:12] <neopolydora> New wiggle + boil over might be a little annoying

[2023-01-04 16:23:37] <shaepukku> wiggle great skill checks will increase sway but not reduce time being carried @Hens333
[2023-01-04 16:23:39] <Modus718> great skill checks on new wiggle don't get you out faster, but they move you around more as killer

[2023-01-04 16:45:43] <Zen_Dragoon> I thought it was time, not the actual lounge?
[2023-01-04 16:45:44] <Yumivers> might be stronger but I feel like the frustration came from insta downs and aura reading
[2023-01-04 16:45:47] <%Kenzou8> lmao thats true
[2023-01-04 16:45:50] <+meanmachine9981> No recharge tho

[2023-01-04 16:46:14] <%mary_6559> @mig_rattlehead ghostface chase music ptsd is too strong
[2023-01-04 16:46:19] <3rdPartyOP> I think you're giving that addon too much credit. That will be hard to utilize well for chase.
[2023-01-04 16:46:22] <+ElMrKors> Lets spam it and show them how broken it is
[2023-01-04 16:46:23] <!%Laser_EU> having no recharge is just gonna make her so boring, because you have to walk everyone down now and cant 2nd blink
[2023-01-04 16:46:23] <%DrIndignation> DbD Needs a new creative directive team. That's the hard truth
