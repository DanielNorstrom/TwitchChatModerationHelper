[2022-12-28 10:23:41] <Glitchkun> the key item for the ship is the scanner which gets treated for the deepseacrap

[2022-12-28 10:56:17] <LumPhoenix> Yes, that one is also called altering cave
[2022-12-28 10:56:20] <Thor_SSB> they could have easily thrown a deoxys in there or something
[2022-12-28 10:56:20] <LumPhoenix> It's the exact same cave.

[2022-12-28 10:59:52] <Taillow> Tail glow is though
[2022-12-28 10:59:59] <%Cryten0> is emeralds mid game harder then fire red?

[2022-12-28 11:01:01] <LumPhoenix> I guess we could get tail glow
[2022-12-28 11:01:05] <Taillow> Special means you don't have to worry about burns or intimidate

[2022-12-28 11:09:28] <%Daemonkith> Low kick AND Hi jump kick?!
[2022-12-28 11:09:39] <LumPhoenix> It's a bad move.
[2022-12-28 11:09:43] VIEWERS: 649
[2022-12-28 11:09:51] <nyoomgoom> extra dangerous with low hp
[2022-12-28 11:09:51] <Thor_SSB> if it didn't punish you for missing it'd be "sort of passable"
[2022-12-28 11:09:58] <Taillow> And it's a high risk move I guess.
[2022-12-28 11:10:07] <throwawaygolf> "i guess"
[2022-12-28 11:10:12] <LumPhoenix> No compound eyes = no hi jump kick

[2022-12-28 11:10:31] <212mochaman> what's even the best fighting move? brick break? low kick?
[2022-12-28 11:10:32] <@%fsvgm777> Yes.

[2022-12-28 11:17:04] <$GhostKumo> They originally were gonna call it Ar-see-us in the anime but they chose to call it Ar-kee-us because they knew British kids would never take it seriously if it was "ARSE-ee-us"
[2022-12-28 11:17:09] <itsZenegos> i feel like people will be incredibly mad if pokemon ever gets voice acting and they use the anime pronunciations

[2022-12-28 11:35:51] <%itsJojoCha> she's being illegal
[2022-12-28 11:35:51] <%Styrmerino> not on the bridge
[2022-12-28 11:35:53] <%Taillow> I'd say yes just to make it closer to nugget bridge

[2022-12-28 11:36:03] <%+akioris> @TGH_sr includding them feels like includding the rocket at the end of nugget bridge.
[2022-12-28 11:36:03] <ChocolateDave> I dunno. The better question is would it give me that ennui?
[2022-12-28 11:36:04] <%Elizashakira> Not on a bike either‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
[2022-12-28 11:36:04] <%Thor_SSB> it's in the SPIRIT of the game, but not the letter of it
[2022-12-28 11:36:05] <%llamaking__> I agree with Mirby's logic. Same amount of trainers as Nugget Bridge
[2022-12-28 11:36:07] <thelargeone> I mean nugget giver wasnt on the bridge

[2022-12-28 11:58:51] <%Worldwide_Wimpy> even ice

[2022-12-28 11:59:25] <%Rootballa> the grass is a lower elevation, so it's bridging "nothing"
[2022-12-28 11:59:27] <%TheArtGremblin> It's kind of an overpass if anything
[2022-12-28 11:59:34] <%itsJojoCha> it's more of an overpass

[2022-12-28 12:00:31] <%Marche9th> it's very likely the ground under nugget bridge is in awful state, since there's a pond adjacent to it and it's noticeably lower elevation than the ground on the other side of the bridge

[2022-12-28 12:02:22] <%HUGHmungous> why does this game have so many hidden double battles lol
[2022-12-28 12:02:31] <%0ldmanbiff> weird, in hgss, nugget bridge is a bridge, but not in frlg
[2022-12-28 12:02:36] <aurorajet> first gen with doubles

[2022-12-28 12:02:49] <%Fio_Hart> Cheer100 Petition to call it Nugget Boardwalk, as it is water adjacent.
[2022-12-28 12:02:50] <doingmybesthere> Emerald introduced the split doubles
[2022-12-28 12:02:54] <%+Pyron18> if it's the electric immunity that is definitely Gen 5 onwards, same thing with Storm Drain for water moves
[2022-12-28 12:02:57] <+minimaul_> or colosseum, where literally EVERY battle is double battles
[2022-12-28 12:03:08] <LightLunas> @Mirby_Studios and bulbapedia also tells you what items are on what route anyway?
[2022-12-28 12:03:10] <%WingedRegent> They did, yeah. They introduced a lot of scenarios that had trainers side-by-side or across from each other to proc at the same time to force Double Battles.
[2022-12-28 12:03:18] <%$Mirby_Studios> that doesn't negate the fact that they're on serebii

[2022-12-28 12:03:36] <Rasschla> they introduced it in r/s. but didn't do too much with it. then in emerald they introduced the trainers on 2 side will trigger a doublefight and they went nuts with it

[2022-12-28 12:04:35] <LightLunas> it just is extremely lacking compared to bulbapedia and so it's useless to say it doesn't have misinformation when it just doesn't tell you half the stuff bulbapedia does

[2022-12-28 12:37:41] <%+Pyron18> @ChaosofLife there are boulders you can hop on with the acro bike
[2022-12-28 12:37:43] <%Taillow> I think that's just so you don't have to take multiple trips up.
[2022-12-28 12:37:51] <ChaosofLife> You need the Bike to climb back up without using the elevator but I don't think it blocks items
[2022-12-28 12:37:52] <%Taillow> So it'd save time maybe.

[2022-12-28 12:38:23] <%Taillow> I guess it depends on how many trips up you would need to make.
[2022-12-28 12:38:38] <%LumPhoenix> Strictly speaking, it's not required for you to enter this cave more than once since you can go the long way around.

[2022-12-28 12:39:13] <%LumPhoenix> So it may be worth checking the rules more thoroughly to see if this cave counts as re-enterable.

[2022-12-28 12:39:16] <ChaosofLife> @LumPhoenix You'd have to go through Rusturf Tunnel which is also a cave though

[2022-12-28 12:39:28] <%LumPhoenix> Yeah, but the tunnel is explicitly re-enterable.

[2022-12-28 12:39:53] <ChaosofLife> Is there any story after Strength though?
[2022-12-28 12:39:55] <%LumPhoenix> Is this cave re-enterable though? The game doesn't force you to do so.

[2022-12-28 13:38:57] <ChaosofLife> It's on Bulbapedia at least
[2022-12-28 13:38:58] <victaghost> the swarm ability increases the amount of pokemon cries you hear on routes too
[2022-12-28 13:39:00] <%Kailaria> no berry trees
[2022-12-28 13:39:06] <Finngus> Bulbapedia does say in Emerald specifically it doubles your chances of getting phonecalls
[2022-12-28 13:39:06] <%0ldmanbiff> it's just weird enough to be both believable and unbelievable at the same time
[2022-12-28 13:39:09] <kotomikun> it is supposedly true, but only in emerald
[2022-12-28 13:39:37] <%berniebeatsboxes> But does Serebii have it logged?

[2022-12-28 13:40:10] <%llamaking__> So, that means Lightningrod is officially the best ability in emerald right? tghSmug
[2022-12-28 13:40:14] <SlingshotOcelot> I'm surprised I've never seen a kaizo player use cut on grass
[2022-12-28 13:40:20] <kotomikun> it's just like... how does that work? does it somehow compel people to call you more often? or does the pokenav get bad signal and drop calls when you don't have lightningrod?
[2022-12-28 13:40:21] <%Styrmerino> this gatr is getting far tho
[2022-12-28 13:40:21] <roflwotl> Either better reception (meaning the default device is poor), or you are getting more spam calls not meant for you

[2022-12-28 13:40:22] <%BRUCETHRILLUS> But can you do trainer rematches?
[2022-12-28 13:40:28] <ToastersOverdose> in this gen you can use cut to cut away the wild grass, the ability hyper cutter makes you cut away more grass

[2022-12-28 13:56:58] <%+theSkyfisher> i think it's just you aren't allowed to leave and come back during the event
[2022-12-28 13:57:03] <%LumPhoenix> When you need to return for Magma Base, you can come up from Lavaridge with the acro bike
[2022-12-28 13:57:07] <%LumPhoenix> That's the only way to do it
[2022-12-28 13:57:13] <@%CarloBrown> nothing illegal about it
[2022-12-28 13:57:29] <doingmybesthere> The tower has a poke center
[2022-12-28 13:57:53] <ChaosofLife> Yeah if you can't return to Mt Chimney you'd need the Acro Bike before going to it to heal and get back up Jagged Pass
[2022-12-28 13:58:14] <victaghost> This&That
[2022-12-28 13:58:14] <%LumPhoenix> So strictly speaking, it never really makes you return to Mt Chimey.
