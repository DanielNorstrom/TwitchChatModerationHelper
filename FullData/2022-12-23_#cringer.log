[2022-12-23 16:14:46] <djuice_> Faring better this year than last, hopefully everything is okay.
[2022-12-23 16:14:52] <%JediMasterTS> A heat pump extracts heat from the cold outside air and transfers it inside our home. To this end, a compressor inside the device uses electricity to increase the temperature of the heat extracted from the outside air. The heat pump can also provide cooling by transferring warm indoor air to the outside
[2022-12-23 16:15:08] <%JediMasterTS> When your heat pump goes into defrost mode, it switches into cooling mode, causing the outdoor coils to heat up to melt any frost or ice within the system. However, because the system is in cooling mode, it means that for a few minutes, it will blow cold air through the vents.

[2022-12-23 16:21:48] <%Ksarul> When you compress a liquid/gas it sheds HEAT. When you let that compressed liquid/gas expand it draws heat out of the surrounding environment. That's the basic principles.

[2022-12-23 19:23:27] <@%$Asiak> The irony is that the empire is racist against aliens
[2022-12-23 19:23:31] <@%$Asiak> but needed to enslave humans
[2022-12-23 19:23:35] <%JackDeez79> The Empire was EXTREMELY speciest

[2022-12-23 19:26:30] <+Noobish101> you do get aliens (some do show up) but andor is inside the empire worlds where there are rarely any aliens
[2022-12-23 19:26:32] <@%$Asiak> yea it was
[2022-12-23 19:26:45] <@%$Asiak> @negative_andy Dude it's so good
[2022-12-23 19:26:52] <+Noobish101> andor is really really good
[2022-12-23 19:26:57] <@%$Asiak> For me it's up there with Mando

[2022-12-23 19:27:15] <@%$Asiak> It shows the empire in a more nuanced way that you've never seen
[2022-12-23 19:27:22] <+northernsky> I was entertained with Andor
[2022-12-23 19:27:32] <@%$Asiak> I think they should do more of it

[2022-12-23 19:27:44] <+husfathend> andor was a proper mature adulty series
[2022-12-23 19:27:46] <negative_andy> Is it better than The Expanse past season 2? @Asiak

[2022-12-23 19:28:08] <%Grunkzzz> Rogue 1 is the only good starwars movie
[2022-12-23 19:28:09] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-23 19:28:16] <%JackDeez79> Stuff like Rogue , Mando and Andor is the direction SW needs to go.  It needs to be dark, gritty and fatalistic to a degree
[2022-12-23 19:28:18] <@%$Asiak> @Cringer I love all the shows, but the takeaway is that you can do good Star Wars series reliant on plot and less on fan serivce.
[2022-12-23 19:28:23] <+Noobish101> yes rogue one was good too, and made sense in the story
[2022-12-23 19:28:25] <@%$Asiak> ANd like I love Mando
[2022-12-23 19:28:27] <%Capn_Darwin> doggo
[2022-12-23 19:28:29] <%+macross_green> I'd say Rogue One is the best recent Star Wars movie anyway.
[2022-12-23 19:28:30] <+husfathend> @asiak great point about how it showed the empire
[2022-12-23 19:28:32] <@%$Asiak> but you know it has a lot of fan service
[2022-12-23 19:28:33] <+Noobish101> andor i can easily say is as good as mandalorian
[2022-12-23 19:28:36] <+northernsky> Well not surpised they are remaking Bab5... no new ideas anymore. They cant make it any worse then the original was.
[2022-12-23 19:28:55] <@%$Asiak> @negative_andy I dunno those are both good and I don't do comparisons but I would say yes
[2022-12-23 19:28:56] <+Noobish101> and there is no force, no aliens, just puts you in the universe without that effort

[2022-12-23 19:29:38] <+Marconos> Rogue 1 ... isn't that the movie where an galactic wide empire has the blue prints for the most powerful weapon in the universe in one spot with the controls to access it outside on a platform 500' off teh ground?
[2022-12-23 19:29:41] <@%$Asiak> it was just a bit more fan service
[2022-12-23 19:29:44] <%JackDeez79> 90% of the movie was the good guys winning but also losing.  For a large part of the war with the Empire that how it was......pyrrhic victories at BEST

[2022-12-23 20:48:44] <sdsheeks> Never understood how trade worked in this game
[2022-12-23 20:49:31] <%philosopherAtLarge> Trade is weird at first but it’s pretty simple once you learn
[2022-12-23 20:49:54] <sdsheeks> So when you see lots of trade value in a system, you want to make a trade hub there, yeah?

[2022-12-23 20:50:36] <%Subtle_D> @HiFiPanda LUL that would be a fun twist
[2022-12-23 20:50:50] <sdsheeks> Ok, makes sense.
[2022-12-23 20:51:14] <%Subtle_D> @Asiak i dont remember the details. but there was some hidden message a bunch of youtubers decifered ...it read, "contact is coming" or something
[2022-12-23 20:51:20] <%philosopherAtLarge> A station has a trade “catchment area” the size of which is defined by the number of trade hubs
[2022-12-23 20:51:29] <%gamerclint> will the be on the exam Cringer? Pikachu
[2022-12-23 20:51:32] <%philosopherAtLarge> It’ll capture all the trade numbers in its catchment
[2022-12-23 20:51:43] <@%$Asiak> @Subtle_D Right but what that means could be, imo, a make primitives better DLC.
[2022-12-23 20:51:46] <@%$Asiak> or
[2022-12-23 20:51:51] <@%$Asiak> a Start as primitves DLC
