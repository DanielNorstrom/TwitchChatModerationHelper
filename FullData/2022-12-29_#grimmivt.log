[2022-12-29 05:59:12] <Pond_water> Quoting randomly from the internet: "Raw foodists advocate refraining from heating food above 104 to 118 degrees Fahrenheit, and assert that higher cooking temperatures destroy the food's enzymes. While this claim is technically true, nutritionists counter that all food-based enzymes are promptly destroyed anyway by stomach acid."
[2022-12-29 05:59:21] <%cheffie> 100% yes, most fruits and veg lose nutrition when cooked, but tomatoes are an exception

[2022-12-29 06:47:13] <%+CainsLupus> I'm no sound director, but if you want J-Cup, you're gonna have to hold out that "Oh?" with an upward inflection on the end the "did I offend you?" in the most patronizing/mocking fashion possible, but that's just my opinion
[2022-12-29 06:47:25] <%supersweethoneybunny> The character seems to have a bit of a "floaty" and elusive voice.

That's what your voice is doing to me right now... Though I'm sure it could be any one of a thousand places, knowing how many things you've been in... ^^'
