[2022-12-18 03:55:18] <@%czeksmyx> I aint Moose, but my fav was probably Thunderking
[2022-12-18 03:56:49] <%+IIIPatternIII> @czeksmyx solid choice, throne was amazing
[2022-12-18 03:57:07] <%+IIIPatternIII> all of mop was amazing

[2022-12-18 03:57:13] <@%czeksmyx> Foundry was sick
[2022-12-18 03:57:40] <@%czeksmyx> I honestly liked all of WoD's raids, just shoulda been one more
[2022-12-18 03:58:59] <%+IIIPatternIII> they were gonna do shattrath as a raid weren't they? that woulda been sick
[2022-12-18 03:59:15] <@%czeksmyx> Most liked something in BFA? He's cancelled
[2022-12-18 03:59:22] <@%czeksmyx> Moose*
[2022-12-18 03:59:57] <%Poocho> I loved doing Siege, MoP was my first time raiding
[2022-12-18 04:00:21] <+ky05uk3> Uld was such a nice raid
[2022-12-18 04:00:26] <%+IIIPatternIII> BoDA was awesome, having bis melee weapons on the first boss was goated
[2022-12-18 04:01:19] <@%czeksmyx> MOTHER fight in Uldir was fun as hell
[2022-12-18 04:02:08] <@%franross_> Healing mother was fun as fuck
[2022-12-18 04:02:16] <%+IIIPatternIII> yeahhh but eventually you had to do g'huun. just starting uldir was trauma wlntCutie
[2022-12-18 04:02:25] <@%franross_> Using spirit link for the first gate and get everyone through was so fun
[2022-12-18 04:02:45] <%Huso833> No it's a good dungeon
[2022-12-18 04:02:47] <%Huso833> raid

[2022-12-18 04:03:03] <%Huso833> Just like the design plus lore plus the fights each being different
[2022-12-18 04:03:15] <@%czeksmyx> You try both sides of BFA?
[2022-12-18 04:03:24] <%Huso833> 2nd phase of blockade could use work
[2022-12-18 04:03:29] <@%franross_> I like the dance in stockades
[2022-12-18 04:03:35] <lostsage540> bloackade Despairge
[2022-12-18 04:03:38] <%GreenConure> can we solo that on mythic for the mount yet?
[2022-12-18 04:03:41] <@%franross_> Shriekwing mythic was fun
[2022-12-18 04:03:55] <%+IIIPatternIII> all aroundreally well designed, I think that's why it was easier than others but still awesome
[2022-12-18 04:05:35] <%+IIIPatternIII> @franross_ thought you were gonna say coucil of blood dance XD
[2022-12-18 04:05:52] <@%franross_> the dance there was fun the first time
[2022-12-18 04:05:54] <%+IIIPatternIII> BOOGY DOWN
[2022-12-18 04:06:01] <@%franross_> I really liked dark recital or whatever it was called
[2022-12-18 04:06:11] <@%franross_> Seeing people blow up to it was hilarious
[2022-12-18 04:06:41] <+Hummerino> As a DK OMEGALAUGHING Sun King for me was running miles away pulling Phoenixes
[2022-12-18 04:07:08] <@%franross_> Sunking was a dogshit fight
[2022-12-18 04:07:09] <@%czeksmyx> I heard that Sludgefist was supposed to be Garrosh
[2022-12-18 04:07:16] <@%franross_> The only fun part was breaking the fire shield
[2022-12-18 04:07:21] <lostsage540> mythic generals Despairge
[2022-12-18 04:07:43] <+Hummerino> moon2SUFFER ohh we missed an add 13 mins into the fight jump off reset
[2022-12-18 04:08:19] <%+IIIPatternIII> stuff like chains on sludgefist made me hate SL as a DH, so many mechanics in that raid clipped its mobility
[2022-12-18 04:08:33] <@%franross_> Sludgefist was awesome as a healer
[2022-12-18 04:08:39] <@%franross_> super fun
[2022-12-18 04:09:06] <%Huso833> Isn't there like a debuff to using non class specific armor
[2022-12-18 04:09:13] <%Huso833> Thought it was like 10% worse
[2022-12-18 04:10:05] <+Hummerino> Yeah in current game you nerf yourself wearing wrong armour
[2022-12-18 04:10:13] <%Babba_Kush> is that Auxidental?
[2022-12-18 04:10:41] <%+IIIPatternIII> I did Azshara with a top 40 guild (not as a main raider) but just seeing the fight when it was current was gross
[2022-12-18 04:10:52] <%+IIIPatternIII> my ass got a carry
