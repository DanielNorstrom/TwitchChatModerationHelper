[2022-12-26 14:55:51] <@%ArnarBjornss> I remember someone at my high school, we had a trashbin outside one of the sorta outer building classfrooms. He literally clapped the entire (small and new) hive to death, one wasp at a time to a rhythm.

[2022-12-26 14:57:02] <shortieXV> Not sure what kind of cost it is but some beekeepers do house visits to help with that stuff.

[2022-12-26 15:08:16] <@%ArnarBjornss> @Tamburmajoren doogLaugh yeah, sorta similar. I remember working at a town utility thing (painting, digging, helping elderly, mowing lawns, paving...).

[2022-12-26 16:34:27] <DarkbladeTheChibiOverlord> Well you could lock her out of the kitchen or something, that should stop the salad making.
[2022-12-26 16:34:28] <@%+AlexRatman> If they were one time use or anyhting it would say on the description
[2022-12-26 16:34:29] <+albions_angel> @Watatsumi_ninja Aw that really sucks. I hopefully dont have it, but we cant be sure. We spend christmas eve with my partner's family, and boxing day with mine. We all did tests before visiting her folks, but her mum felt ill that night (after we left) and tested again. Positive. So we are schrodingers patients right now!
[2022-12-26 16:34:40] <+MageMilk> I guess because sword is not orb shape, its like a sticker on a marble?
