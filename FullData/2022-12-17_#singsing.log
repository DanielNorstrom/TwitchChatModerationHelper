[2022-12-17 06:43:19] <@%$communistwizard> like how people include sekiro into the same series
[2022-12-17 06:43:24] <@%$communistwizard> yea I saw the IGN interview
[2022-12-17 06:43:25] <@%hatduck_> souls like games are becoming borderline BatChest now
[2022-12-17 06:43:27] <!%mirakuru797> PepeLaf
[2022-12-17 06:43:34] <@%$communistwizard> like 80% of the questions is "its like souls right?"

[2022-12-17 06:43:45] <@%hatduck_> like battle royale was BatChest for few years
[2022-12-17 06:43:50] <@%hatduck_> now its souls like BatChest
[2022-12-17 06:43:59] <!%mirakuru797> BatChest
[2022-12-17 06:44:03] <@%$communistwizard> and miyazaki and yamamura are like N OMEGALOOOOL
[2022-12-17 06:44:41] <@%StreamFollower> To be fair, it has been 10 years since their last Souls like game. Sekiro is definitely Souls like, even though it's an aberration. It would be surprising if AC6 isn't influenced by the series at all.
[2022-12-17 06:44:49] <!%mirakuru797> yamamura worked on sekiro, so is like sekiro? Pepege
[2022-12-17 06:45:13] <@%$communistwizard> yamamura also worked on AC4 and AC:FA
[2022-12-17 06:45:18] <@%$communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2022-12-17 06:45:19] <@%$communistwizard> Just saying
[2022-12-17 06:45:41] <!%mirakuru797> fuking fromsoft 5Head , ac not sell well just make souls game become famous and bring the fans to ac 5Head
[2022-12-17 06:45:53] <@%$communistwizard> @StreamFollower I think you mean 10 years since their last AC game?
[2022-12-17 06:45:53] <@%StreamFollower> Decade of time has passed. That's a big deal. Devs who were good in the past can, and easily do go on to make things that are not as good as what they made previously.

[2022-12-17 06:46:42] <!%mirakuru797> i believe ac6 is make at the same time as sekiro and elden ring
[2022-12-17 06:46:54] <@%StreamFollower> @StreamFollower No, I meant what I wrote. Unless you consider them making "Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village DX" and "Déraciné" as notable entries.
[2022-12-17 06:46:56] <!%mirakuru797> that is like 7 years of devolep
[2022-12-17 06:46:59] <@%$communistwizard> @mirakuru797 Well tbf, ACV/VD did alright, and other games did decently

[2022-12-17 07:49:06] <@%hatduck_> if u have no food, just get some whiskas wet food for now
[2022-12-17 07:49:08] <Vincanthofred> you can give it sardines or salmon Tasty
[2022-12-17 07:49:16] <@%hatduck_> if you're seriously thinking of keeping the cat
[2022-12-17 07:49:19] <Vincanthofred> canned
[2022-12-17 07:49:25] <@%hatduck_> then look into some good pet food at ur local pet store

[2022-12-17 07:50:00] <@%hatduck_> dont buy whiskas or purepet or drools dry cat food
[2022-12-17 07:50:11] <@%hatduck_> @mepsyduck_ cats require a lot less attention and care than you think
[2022-12-17 07:50:17] <@%hatduck_> i havent bathed my cat in years
[2022-12-17 07:50:21] <!%mirakuru797> DansChamp

[2022-12-17 07:50:36] <!%mirakuru797> indoor okey
[2022-12-17 07:50:45] <%mepsyduck_> when i not around like 10 hours a day
[2022-12-17 07:50:54] <@%hatduck_> @mepsyduck_ then just get a few packets of whiskas wet food
[2022-12-17 07:50:54] <Vincanthofred> just leave it outside okey
[2022-12-17 07:50:55] <@%hatduck_> it'll be very happy
[2022-12-17 07:51:02] <%mepsyduck_> how long do they last?
[2022-12-17 07:51:10] <@%hatduck_> one packet is one meal
[2022-12-17 07:51:11] <@%hatduck_> oh wait
[2022-12-17 07:51:13] <@%hatduck_> u mean
[2022-12-17 07:51:18] <@%hatduck_> oh nvm i misread
[2022-12-17 07:51:22] <@%hatduck_> so ur not keeping the cat
[2022-12-17 07:51:25] <@%hatduck_> just want to feed a stray
[2022-12-17 07:51:29] <%mepsyduck_> ye
[2022-12-17 07:52:08] <@%hatduck_> then i guess
[2022-12-17 07:52:15] <@%hatduck_> u can get a pack of whiskas cat food
[2022-12-17 07:52:15] <%mepsyduck_> i can see there's a 85g whiskas tuna in jelly
[2022-12-17 07:52:16] <@%hatduck_> or purepet
[2022-12-17 07:52:21] <@%hatduck_> they're relatively cheap
[2022-12-17 07:52:26] <@%hatduck_> nah dont get all that
[2022-12-17 07:52:30] <@%hatduck_> too expensive in the long run
[2022-12-17 07:52:35] <@%hatduck_> one is just one time meal
[2022-12-17 07:52:45] <@%hatduck_> u can get a pack of whiskas dry food
[2022-12-17 07:52:51] <@%hatduck_> get a bowl
[2022-12-17 07:52:54] <Vincanthofred> kill a rat and prechew it
[2022-12-17 07:52:59] <%mepsyduck_> NOTED
[2022-12-17 07:53:00] <namhays> 85g isnt enough for one comsuption
[2022-12-17 07:53:04] <@%hatduck_> and every time ur feeding, just put some water in the bowl with the food
[2022-12-17 07:53:16] <@%hatduck_> dry food tends to suck out their body water
[2022-12-17 07:53:25] <@%hatduck_> so if u just make it a bit wet, will be fine
[2022-12-17 07:53:32] <%mepsyduck_> NOTED 󠀀

[2022-12-17 07:53:36] <@%hatduck_> dont have to make it a soup
[2022-12-17 07:53:48] <%mepsyduck_> there's too many options
[2022-12-17 07:53:55] <@%hatduck_> any one is fine
[2022-12-17 07:54:01] <!%mirakuru797> cheap one okey

[2022-12-17 07:56:04] <@%hatduck_> friend's friend had a street cat give lots of bebes near his house
[2022-12-17 07:56:12] <@%hatduck_> so friend was asking around if anyone wanted to adopt
[2022-12-17 07:56:49] <%mepsyduck_> there's many stray cats in my apt. one gave birth and i think my neighbour will semi-adopt her
[2022-12-17 07:56:59] <%mepsyduck_> i'm thinking i'll help her with food and such
[2022-12-17 07:57:13] <@%hatduck_> one major health concern for cats is
[2022-12-17 07:57:22] <@%hatduck_> any nasal related infections
[2022-12-17 07:57:26] <%mepsyduck_> Hmm
[2022-12-17 07:57:33] <@%hatduck_> their nose and tear glands etc can get infected very easily
[2022-12-17 07:57:46] <@%AuLoen> Cat PepeSpit

[2022-12-17 07:58:13] <@%hatduck_> disease is disease
[2022-12-17 07:58:19] <@%hatduck_> mange is another thing
[2022-12-17 07:58:26] <@%hatduck_> lots of indian street cats and dogs have mange
[2022-12-17 07:58:30] <@%hatduck_> it looks like a skin disease
[2022-12-17 07:58:33] <%mepsyduck_> Hmm
[2022-12-17 07:58:37] <@%hatduck_> but its really caused by tiny mites
[2022-12-17 07:58:39] <@%hatduck_> or fleas
[2022-12-17 07:58:40] <@%hatduck_> or something idk
[2022-12-17 07:58:42] <%mepsyduck_> like where the hair starts to fall?

[2022-12-17 07:58:55] <@%hatduck_> its because of parasitic insects on their skin
[2022-12-17 07:59:00] <%$inoe182> remember when sing posted mango
[2022-12-17 07:59:37] <@%hatduck_> one easy buy slow solution is to use a spot-on like medication
[2022-12-17 07:59:45] <%mepsyduck_> is mango adopted or bought?

[2022-12-17 08:00:18] <@%hatduck_> spot-on is a brand for dogs, its a small tube like fevikwik, u just put the liquid on the dog's back on the skin on a few spots, it absorbs thru the skin into the blood, and any parasites that feed will die
[2022-12-17 08:00:24] <Vincanthofred> got what homie_empie

[2022-12-17 10:41:44] <@%AuLoen> xtx is abit better than 4080
[2022-12-17 10:41:47] <@%AuLoen> and cheaper
[2022-12-17 10:41:49] <!%mirakuru797> 4080 is DansChamp
[2022-12-17 10:41:59] <!%mirakuru797> if u want nvidia go 4090
[2022-12-17 10:42:03] <!%MisterMonsieur> DankNoted
[2022-12-17 10:42:14] <@%AuLoen> so my choice is xtx

[2022-12-17 10:42:51] <!%mirakuru797> and when amd done update with the driver it maybe be better than 2080
[2022-12-17 10:43:00] <!%mirakuru797> 4080*
[2022-12-17 10:43:21] <@%AuLoen> for gaming xtx is better than 4080

[2022-12-17 12:21:34] <Karnaros> @Trajan_Hunter Well, to be fair, this is how devs improve this game. Basically first month is negative (but mostly valid) feedback from players and finetuning from devs and then comes time for positive feedback.

[2022-12-17 14:36:12] <DuchyWillRiseAgain> @Vincanthofred My statement got absolutely twisted to the wrong part. There's nothing for me to apologize for, I'm not defending the abusers. I would never actually defend one, I never cheat in games, it's disgusting for me, so again if my view got completely misunderstood there's nothing for me to apologize for.

[2022-12-17 16:42:10] <%Nutzzz96> @Christmas_Fighters, thats a nice thing that your Workge is soughted out for but at the same time, they could give you scumbag offers so its better to know and dig shit up before making a proper decision
