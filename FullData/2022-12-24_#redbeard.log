[2022-12-24 12:39:58] <%zeddtinn> @GayEagleDima yeah for sure, you may be attracted sexually but don't like the personality, and the opposite goes as well. IMO liking is more important than s. attraction.

[2022-12-24 12:58:27] <@%Tazny> Its really just a matter of perspective and how things always seem worse from yours, like every card your opponent plays seems like a perfect answer. But really they're probably thinking the exact same thing about what you're playing against them
