[2022-12-30 14:42:25] <typhoon_breezy> does the school system down there do a winter break in February? I know in some places the kids are out by may
[2022-12-30 14:42:30] <@%$Everleigh> 100% for sure hope for those things!
[2022-12-30 14:42:36] <+tyrsalt> It is our hopes. The youngest had necrotizing pancreatitis. Oldest had two knee surgeries.
[2022-12-30 14:42:56] <@%$Asiak> ooof hope they get patched up
[2022-12-30 14:42:59] <@%$Everleigh> @typhoon_breezy Our used to do like a 4 day break in Feb, but I am not sure that is on the table this year.

[2022-12-30 14:43:53] <typhoon_breezy> @xreadyaimmissx same... then we had spring break then out by mid June depending on the number of snow days

[2022-12-30 14:44:41] <%xReadyAimMissx> @typhoon_breezy yup same, although normally we got out of school pretty deep into june. because our winters always sucked. LUL

[2022-12-30 15:28:04] <%manu_forti> funny thing to me is they can create wind power and lights, but need to research how to plant a tree
[2022-12-30 15:28:43] <Neph2019> @manu_forti yeah like you have to research bows but can immeadiately make wind farms

[2022-12-30 17:01:59] <+icehawk219> you could throw the bodies in the river

[2022-12-30 17:03:13] <Krymzon74> I don't like going into the zone menu and removing the graves from the home area so I burn all the bodies or throw them in the river

[2022-12-30 17:10:36] <%Bezrider> Stream was a bit jumpy for me 10min ago but alright now
[2022-12-30 17:10:43] <@%plujoenium> I've been having random freezes as well.
[2022-12-30 17:10:44] <%mikkeos> Streams on European servers seem to have way more issues today than US based streams. I have not seen a single stream without issues though.
[2022-12-30 17:11:15] <NexioTLG> you are perfect to me Cringer
