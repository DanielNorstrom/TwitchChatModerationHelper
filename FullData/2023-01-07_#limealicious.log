[2023-01-07 21:46:09] <@%Dawnyan> anyway
[2023-01-07 21:46:10] <%pyuk_umuku> It drops foe accuracy which is fun
[2023-01-07 21:46:23] <%wurblewind> I'm a Muddy Water guy, myself, but I respect the Pulse.
[2023-01-07 21:46:26] <ChantenWolfe> @dittofire1 but the accuracy debuff

[2023-01-07 21:46:30] <@%KieueCaprie> I think for consistency, I suggest Water Pulse.
[2023-01-07 21:46:31] <TheKamenZero> What's Pulse's power again?
[2023-01-07 21:46:31] <%Ultima_Weapon02> Muddy water actually has a chance to lower the opponents accuracy which is great
[2023-01-07 21:46:34] <+Pokenomicon> ask Vaporeon

[2023-01-07 21:51:54] <stefmorino> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch.

[2023-01-07 22:25:08] <Yaltabaoth> I like it, but I think it looks visually stupid

[2023-01-07 22:25:11] <%kepheru446> visually i don't like it, stragety wise I think it's cool
[2023-01-07 22:25:12] <%$adamdotpng> yep
[2023-01-07 22:25:12] <@%TheLawlDawg> I actually like it mechanically, it makes raids really fun
[2023-01-07 22:25:13] <samiam1616> yes

[2023-01-07 22:25:19] <@%NekomataMaid> i mostly hate it in raids cause the counter still goes down while the animation is going
[2023-01-07 22:25:20] <Ergulor> I think the mechanics are good but the style sucks
[2023-01-07 22:25:21] <%GreenApe_Dta14> its dumb, but ai really like it mechanically
[2023-01-07 22:25:22] <+sonicSass> every battle mechanic except for mega evolution was dumb
[2023-01-07 22:25:23] <samiam1616> mechanically it's cool, visually it could've been anything but the dumb hat
[2023-01-07 22:25:24] <CaptainKladdkaka> I like it as a mechanic but it sucks visually
[2023-01-07 22:25:26] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Defensively, yes, offensively, no.
[2023-01-07 22:25:26] <F00BAD00> yes but it still gets stab
[2023-01-07 22:25:26] <TheHylianGuard> Strategically: OW
[2023-01-07 22:25:26] <Mazzax_Manacry> @AdrenALI_N They wouldn't necessarily consider it wrong to help their trainer.

[2023-01-07 22:25:31] <%$Whats_Aleppo> limesSob
[2023-01-07 22:25:31] <%+AdrenALI_N> thats unfortunate, I love the abilty to provide coverage with a different type, it adds so much strategy to your pokemon moveset and counter finameNom
[2023-01-07 22:25:31] <%EasySqueezy01> You think ow
[2023-01-07 22:25:33] <HawkinsXCV> i only used it when i had to which was like the tutorial
[2023-01-07 22:25:34] <%$saffykins> I liked.. GIANT POKEMON
[2023-01-07 22:25:36] <Yaltabaoth> It just LOOKS stupid
[2023-01-07 22:25:37] <%VelSparko> Your only real move when something Terrastralizes is to do it yourself to make it an even match
[2023-01-07 22:25:41] <%$saffykins> HUGE JIGGLYPUFF
[2023-01-07 22:25:42] <Ergulor> the only good hat is the bug one
[2023-01-07 22:25:44] <%donn_is_me> i love the shiny crystals, hate the hats.
[2023-01-07 22:25:44] <%keef789> they should have made the teachers terrastilize during the exams
[2023-01-07 22:25:45] <Yaltabaoth> It's like you put a giant goofy hat on, yeah
[2023-01-07 22:25:45] <samiam1616> oh right poison type
[2023-01-07 22:25:45] <theworsttimelime> at least the sparkles are pretty
[2023-01-07 22:25:46] <%Ultima_Weapon02> @NekomataMaid Dude the fucking raids give me a headache that you cant even skip animations
[2023-01-07 22:25:53] <%Terravir> just another form change, just bring back mega evolutions
[2023-01-07 22:25:54] <%EasySqueezy01> WAAAAAA
[2023-01-07 22:25:54] <+3D_Bob> Mega evolution was peak
[2023-01-07 22:25:54] <%+AdrenALI_N> @Mazzax_Manacry I'm sure they would provide emotional support but they might faint if they dared do something evil adrenaRage

[2023-01-07 22:26:02] <%CocoonMoon> What's the name of the blobby fish pokemon? limesThink
[2023-01-07 22:26:05] <THKTheRedKirby> I also thought mega evolutions were dumb due to how limited it was
[2023-01-07 22:26:07] <%MakorelFish> perhaps you should terastaldadastalaze
[2023-01-07 22:26:08] <CaptainKladdkaka> Even a lazy pallette swap or aura would have been better than the hats IMO LUL
[2023-01-07 22:26:10] <AverageHanzo> No idea what was wrong with mega evolution, most of those designs were actually pretty cool
[2023-01-07 22:26:12] <Yaltabaoth> @CocoonMoon Coldsire
[2023-01-07 22:26:12] <TwistedLullaby> it is annoying, but it is meant for the competitive multiplayer
[2023-01-07 22:26:12] <BopBeep> I would like a mix of Mega evolution and this
[2023-01-07 22:26:14] <%kaninom_kas> I dont hate the hats, justt that they glow so much you can barelly see the pokemon

[2023-01-07 22:26:24] <ChantenWolfe> the tera system is great though, my Ground Tera Lumineon with Storm Drain likes it very much <3
[2023-01-07 22:26:25] <AverageHanzo> And gameplay-wise it's almost the same
[2023-01-07 22:26:26] <%+AdrenALI_N> I did not like Mega or Dynamaxing but thats cause they didn't provide the scope Terastallizing does finameNom

[2023-01-07 22:26:48] <@%TheLawlDawg> Yeah and no pokemon get special forms with it either
[2023-01-07 22:26:49] <TheKamenZero> The mechanic is cool
[2023-01-07 22:26:52] <CaptainKladdkaka> I like that every pokémon can use it, not just "the chosen few"
[2023-01-07 22:26:52] <%haplaplon> limesOmg
[2023-01-07 22:26:52] <%Terravir> mega evolutions could also change typings for some pokemon
[2023-01-07 22:26:53] <!%+Tene> @c0detalker_ terastalise, this gen's gimmick. lets you change/reinforce a pokemon's typing
[2023-01-07 22:26:53] <%+AdrenALI_N> ok you can change the looks from silly hats, but for me thats small potatoes for what it is adrenaYAYA

[2023-01-07 22:27:31] <%GreenApe_Dta14> Megas were a good idea until they gave megas to good pokemon and kinda fucked its whole point ip

[2023-01-07 22:27:37] <samiam1616> Megas were cool but kind of a pain in balancing because only like four of them ended up very viable out of a pool of 30ish and were otherwise a rich get richer mechanic.

[2023-01-07 22:27:49] <theworsttimelime> ok :)

[2023-01-07 22:27:50] <%+AdrenALI_N> @EasySqueezy01 mega evos were far too elitist and restrictive to be good, Tera allows ANY pokemon the power to adapt finameCool
[2023-01-07 22:27:51] <Mazzax_Manacry> @AdrenALI_N Drowzee and Hypno are menaces to society because they eat people's dreams and disrupt their sleep. I doubt cheating on a test is more morally repugnant.

[2023-01-07 22:27:55] <DonCorlyfries> Honestly, just applying a crystal effect to the Pokemon itself would have been enough for Terastallizing.

[2023-01-07 22:29:51] <%Noruko> Also, what makes the battle "illicit" compared to the random people just looking to throw down with anyone who comes walking by?

[2023-01-07 22:30:01] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> got any more of them xp  candies?  want to break the limits to one of em?
[2023-01-07 22:30:15] <%pyuk_umuku> All three finales are around the same level so by the time you get to the last one you’ll be over levelled
[2023-01-07 22:30:15] <Yaltabaoth> They probably want to avoid property damage
[2023-01-07 22:30:16] <%the_lost_messenger> You should be fine for Cassiopeia. They're one of the easiest fights in the game IMO.
[2023-01-07 22:30:18] <%Ultima_Weapon02> i think your properly leveled

[2023-01-07 22:30:45] <%Magn919> One would think a battle between student and teacher, shouldn't cause too many problems on a school all about pokémon battles
[2023-01-07 22:30:45] <Mazzax_Manacry> Mostly just on school grounds outside of designated areas.
[2023-01-07 22:30:45] <%$Ben_Couch> Kinda reminds me of Secret of Mana music.
[2023-01-07 22:30:47] <%KitsuneofTime> my main problem with this school of theirs......they tell the students they don't need to come to class so long as they seek their treasures..... raise your hand chat if your school said you dont need to go to school so you decide to just stay home limesHmm
