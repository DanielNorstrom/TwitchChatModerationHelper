[2022-12-08 14:44:55] <%+mejdj1981> Well, I bet riot has statistics on games won when someone afks early in the game, so 4v5, I don't think the win % is very high.
[2022-12-08 14:45:00] <%$Man_Of_Pontos> Sometimes you just dont wanna waste energy on a bad experience so when there is a system you can take advantage of you are likely to use it
[2022-12-08 14:45:02] <%+johnwestgamer> thats gotta be a bug

[2022-12-08 16:59:30] <ThatQuarter> @Tanamil attack champions only is your ~ key. it only keeps you from right clicking minions, towers, or using abalities on minions/monsters. Attack moving will still make you attack minions, but not towers. The only other attack move change you can do is option is switching attack move to attack nearest target

[2022-12-08 17:07:52] <ZazusX> problem with yuumi is that if one player is not a monkey then yuumi wins the game.
[2022-12-08 17:08:18] <romierome31> best part of yummi is everytime u kill the person shes on u get 2 kills worth of gold.

[2022-12-08 17:26:41] <MonoRedTron> no voicechat cuz all the lillia roleplayers would get death threats
[2022-12-08 17:26:42] <rovben> they have voicechat in dota... rip
[2022-12-08 17:26:42] <%+Jhazlos> league of legends is 100% a psyop
[2022-12-08 17:26:43] <%imGOGGLES> would it really be that though KEKO
[2022-12-08 17:26:43] <+K1Z_GODTAIL> i know the reason, and the reason is ppl like you screaming down everyones pipes when ur jg doesnt camp ur lane
[2022-12-08 17:26:43] <!%hossxox> ITS A BAIT ü™ù
[2022-12-08 17:26:46] <ChiefPelican> like if I'm gonna get called a slur in league at may as well be over voice chat at this point. easier to mute them.
[2022-12-08 17:27:00] <+justthenutshangingout> just paste a discord link in lobby
[2022-12-08 17:27:00] <%$itsdaveygravy> 2-2 vote cant do it

[2022-12-08 17:27:46] <+monkeyarmz> you're the calmest streamer I've seen
[2022-12-08 17:27:47] <%Aerked> It's more easier to talk about it with voice chat than just typing it in the middle of a play.
[2022-12-08 17:27:51] <falun_the_penguin> why are there suddenly so much olaf players?

[2022-12-08 17:28:22] <+stupidw00> Games with voice chat have to record your communication.
