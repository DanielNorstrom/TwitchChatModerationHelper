[2022-12-15 18:00:53] <EmceeEsher> were there 16 games or 15? screen says 16 but chesscom says only 15
[2022-12-15 18:00:55] <+FiGhT_66jPs> Is 9.0/16 a good position for right now ???
[2022-12-15 18:01:05] <+WindowsRTrashh> what does it mean to play 3+1?
[2022-12-15 18:01:11] <%+chessbender> looks pretty drawish to me
[2022-12-15 18:01:12] <EmceeEsher> score should be 8.5.-6.5
[2022-12-15 18:01:14] <@%+Creamsicle> @FiGhT_66jPs yeah
[2022-12-15 18:01:31] <@%crazycoffeeman> @WindowsRTrashh each player starts with 3m and they get 1 additional second for each move played
[2022-12-15 18:01:32] <+ilovethisgame99> @WindowsRTrashh 3 minutes each, 1 second increment every move
[2022-12-15 18:01:36] <@%+Creamsicle> @EmceeEsher wdym? we match the chesscom score

[2022-12-15 18:29:28] <@%crazycoffeeman> @necro_hacks he could have, but the match clock is different from the game clock. He wanted to kill match time to give Nihal less time to catch up on match points.
[2022-12-15 18:29:35] <Drahacik> Nihaj has to win 5 games in a row, because there is time only for 5 games.

[2022-12-15 18:31:02] <@%crazycoffeeman> @BatGuin_ Nihal the only draw nihal could force was the 50-move draw. He didn't let his clock run down, he tried speeding through it. His only other option would have been to resign or play a move that could lose him the game.
[2022-12-15 18:31:03] <+ryan5541> @tboykings if hikaru plays like how he did vs nihal in the 3+1, then probably magnus

[2022-12-15 19:11:38] <%+pokoyo_mi> 5 + 1 is chaos, No wonder hikaru is attracted to it

[2022-12-15 19:11:45] <sal_salo> @gggcccA7X I'm thinking a few more years back, when Ronaldo led Portugal winning the Euro. I think it was in 2016 or so. Messi had troubles at the time frame, if I remember properly.
