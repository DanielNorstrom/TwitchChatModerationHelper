[2022-12-15 18:30:08] <pantsdonkey> Magnus will adopt in his next match
[2022-12-15 18:30:12] <BatGuin_> @crazycoffeeman and why did nihal do the  same tho?
[2022-12-15 18:30:13] <%donthe2nd> I hope MVL does better than Fabi

[2022-12-15 18:31:02] <@%crazycoffeeman> @BatGuin_ Nihal the only draw nihal could force was the 50-move draw. He didn't let his clock run down, he tried speeding through it. His only other option would have been to resign or play a move that could lose him the game.
[2022-12-15 18:31:03] <+ryan5541> @tboykings if hikaru plays like how he did vs nihal in the 3+1, then probably magnus
