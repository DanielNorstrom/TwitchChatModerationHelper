[2023-01-08 06:11:55] <%GratuitousCatouflage> Though I don't really think there has been a better theme park MMO than WoW at this point.

[2023-01-08 06:12:15] <PKM4STER> Riot MMO is the one im waiting for tbh. i want an mmo to play
[2023-01-08 06:12:16] <+thatdudejohn62> Best the player base has invested literal years into collection, gold, gear, achievements etc people aren’t gonna just give that up
[2023-01-08 06:12:17] <twobladepete> i been grinding in gw2 more then wow
[2023-01-08 06:12:27] <%+NicAtNight> EQ is still kicking
[2023-01-08 06:12:33] <+thatdudejohn62> Wow the player base has invested literal years into collection, gold, gear, achievements etc people aren’t gonna just give that up
[2023-01-08 06:12:36] <@%Stonefather> I mean you aren't wrong, there is also the a lot of people are playing this thus it must be good effect.
[2023-01-08 06:12:38] <%+NicAtNight> 100% nostalgia
[2023-01-08 06:12:48] <%Moose__Nipples> @identityuknwn yeah the world is so good for a MMO, so i have high hopes but also none
[2023-01-08 06:12:55] <%+大綿津見神 (owatatsumi)> Like Cohh and EQ LUL
[2023-01-08 06:13:05] <!%thetestgame> Please don't want change. I mean look at FF14. 1.0 bomb and they rebooted it copying Wow and now it outpaces WoW in numbers.
[2023-01-08 06:13:21] <PKM4STER> how has it been going? NODDERS Arrr mah dah

[2023-01-08 06:13:45] <%Newrooter> @BurkeBlack I think it's not that there haven't been some great MMO more than very few companies understand how to manage an MMO after launch like Blizzard for content releasing
[2023-01-08 06:14:08] <%GratuitousCatouflage> @thetestgame Though in that example, 1.0 was an absolute trainwreck of a game.

[2023-01-08 06:15:44] <%GratuitousCatouflage> @thetestgame It's less people wanting the same thing rather than theme park MMOs being the far far larger market, which was grown under WoW. Sandboxes just aint going to be mainstream.

[2023-01-08 06:18:00] <%+C_a_l_l_u_m____> @BurkeBlack When you're both a nerd and a gamer, but you also have a wife who wants to eat like normal people and don't play games at all or use a PC , much less a laptop, then you have a dining room with a dining table and 6 chairs which have to cost a small fortune because it has to be "nice" , so lesson here is, if you're ever gonna find a soulmate, you have to accept she's gonna do what she wants with the house.

[2023-01-08 06:19:23] <%GratuitousCatouflage> They cheaped out so hard on SWTOR's bones and rushed it. Makes me sad considering how good the story stuff was.
[2023-01-08 06:19:26] <%CynicalCanandian> SWTORs story is really good in the early expansion

[2023-01-08 07:47:28] <maxfujawa> Lead Ore can be found in above ground patches and underground in both Navezgane and Random World Generation.
[2023-01-08 07:47:30] <%Moose__Nipples> so in base game there are nodes above ground that will tell you if there is that resource below ground

[2023-01-08 07:50:34] <%owain_> you can see nodes on you map @BurkeBlack i think lead is grey
[2023-01-08 07:50:43] <Dravite> ^^ look at the map.
[2023-01-08 07:50:49] <friesengeist> Lyngbakr yep just bring some ladders
[2023-01-08 07:50:51] <MrDoomroxxar> This ore distribution is in the mining journal entry
[2023-01-08 07:51:00] <MrDoomroxxar> or look at the map
[2023-01-08 07:51:05] <%owain_> they show up as dots on your map
[2023-01-08 07:51:12] <Lyngbakr> @BurkeBlack Zoom in and you see those "pixels", different colours = different resources

[2023-01-08 07:51:47] <Lyngbakr> Pitch black dots are Coal iirc. Brown is iron
[2023-01-08 07:52:04] <%+Grey_Gamer77> According to google lead is most prominent in the forest biome @burkeblack
[2023-01-08 07:52:04] <Lyngbakr> I cant remember the uuh.. colour for lead or nitrate, but blue is one of them

[2023-01-08 07:52:36] <mackdaddy9857> lead is blue, white is nitrate, black is coal, iron is orangish brown
[2023-01-08 07:52:38] <kablekat> blue is lead if i remember correctly nitrate is white
[2023-01-08 07:52:44] <friesengeist> gotta look at them rocks BurkeBlack
[2023-01-08 07:52:54] <Lyngbakr> @kablekat yeah that sounds about right now that you mention it
[2023-01-08 07:52:57] <maxfujawa> Yes but nitrate is fairly common
[2023-01-08 07:53:15] <kablekat> and in DF seeing you have titanium that is only found in wasteland that is a bit easier to find there
[2023-01-08 07:53:22] <mackdaddy9857> you wont find it in a city
[2023-01-08 07:53:26] <kablekat> and the radiated material
[2023-01-08 07:53:43] <kablekat> nitrate is easier to find in the desert imo
[2023-01-08 07:54:06] <+chrisp719> will this game ever be updated on console?
[2023-01-08 07:54:22] <kablekat> when the game goes gold they are releasing a NEW game basically for console
[2023-01-08 07:54:24] <friesengeist> you find the rock and if its lead you dig down

[2023-01-08 07:54:48] <DarkLaces> you find rocks on the surface mine it and it will tell you what is down there
[2023-01-08 07:54:49] <Lyngbakr> yeah, the lead rock looks like a squared rock
[2023-01-08 07:54:58] <+Altyrian> lead by the nose?
[2023-01-08 07:55:00] <kablekat> if you break one and it is alot of things there isnt a solid spot below it
[2023-01-08 07:55:10] <MrDoomroxxar> @Lyngbakr Not in this mod pack
[2023-01-08 07:55:11] <kablekat> but if you dig a rock and it is nothing but 1 material that is what is below it
[2023-01-08 07:55:15] <Grim2029> Look on your map: Iron - rust colored White - Nitrate Black - Coal Lead - bluish grey.
[2023-01-08 07:55:19] <maxfujawa> Lead ore is grey/blue
[2023-01-08 07:55:23] <MrTheBest01> yeah, i find ore by looking for the metal boulders on the surface
[2023-01-08 07:55:34] <MrTheBest01> and dig down from there
[2023-01-08 07:55:34] <Lyngbakr> @Lyngbakr Oh it's under just normal rocks here? It's been a bit since i played this one
[2023-01-08 07:55:47] <friesengeist> the metal boulders alone will yield a good amount if he doesnt find lead right away
[2023-01-08 07:55:57] <Masterhp> ah my fav cave
[2023-01-08 07:55:57] <DarkLaces> when you mind a rock up on the top it needs to only have stone and lead or stone and nitrate if you find a rock that has multiple things like Stone nitrate lead Etc you're not going to find a ore vein

[2023-01-08 08:03:08] <DarkLaces> it's better if he just goes to the surface and hits the little square blocks until they say lead and then he can mine down from there it's going to take forever if he mines at the bottom

[2023-01-08 08:12:05] <Masterhp> it cried like if you kicked a dog
[2023-01-08 08:12:10] <kablekat> biggest issue is people are missconstruing vanilla with DF DF there isnt many visible nodes above ground you have to break the resource bolders to see what is below ground
[2023-01-08 08:12:13] <saderingrad_productions> count doggo
[2023-01-08 08:12:18] <DanielTheMedic> it was a demigorgon
[2023-01-08 08:12:26] <+LootGoblins> All zombified Doggo monstrositys must die..
[2023-01-08 08:12:27] <friesengeist> i usually mine all surface boulders to get easy ress they drop all kinds of stuff unless its a mine underneath
[2023-01-08 08:12:30] <Undepth> @BurkeBlack if it helps when you open the map there are tiny squares that signify a node underneath and what that node is. Cobalt blue is lead

[2023-01-08 08:13:38] <%+Angry_Viking> Burke. lead is secondary in snow and green zone. you will have to hit the small rocks to find out what is under them
[2023-01-08 08:13:39] <%+rambletonne> don't want to et a prince Harry out there in the snow
[2023-01-08 08:13:44] <Masterhp> idk how different this is but in normal game i just get lead by looting

[2023-01-08 08:21:48] <%+Enigmal> There are two indicators as to what ore is underground:      Surface deposits      When you dig the gravel-looking patches on the ground, you'll get trace amounts of an ore as well.  Each biome has one specific ore that generates naturally. All biomes contain iron.      Nitrate: Snow and Wasteland      Coal: Burnt Forest and Plains      Lead: Maple Forest and Pine Forest      Oil Shale: Desert

[2023-01-08 08:39:18] <razerfreak3> they stole all of it :(

[2023-01-08 08:39:36] <maxfujawa> Check weapons 3
[2023-01-08 08:39:42] <%NaerahQc> ok but i doubt you need to carry that many bolts, even if you were shooting non stop, your reload time makes it impossible to go through all of them in a night

[2023-01-08 09:58:39] <%xen_mind> also you can get the benefits from fasting with a less extreme regime, e.g. eat for 8 hour window is fine

[2023-01-08 10:03:23] <+SONRISE> I went from 232 lbs to 185lbs doing the fast, maintaining 185 now.  It has helped me a lot, convenient and very easy to keep for me
[2023-01-08 10:03:27] <wiggle_everytime_boop> so you think.
[2023-01-08 10:03:47] <%rubberdubdub101> eat once a day as I have crohns you get used to it easy
[2023-01-08 10:04:24] <joksitus> 1,5h good lenght for overall time
[2023-01-08 10:04:30] <silkenflyer88> I always say. Just eat smaller portions. Maybe 25% what you normally eat. My dad has done that and lost 20lbs
[2023-01-08 10:04:34] <AvivLobel> walking 1 1/2 hour a day every two days will be very good for you

[2023-01-08 10:05:14] <+chobtt> The problem is that with food is never easy especialy if you like food. You have to find a way where you eat well but you're not gaining weight. What i learned when i lost weight if you're not doing a diet that you couldn't keep up your entire life without feeling miserable than that's not the good way
[2023-01-08 10:05:22] <KKDrex> if youre just drilling it all out you can do only the bottom layer youre cutting and everything above will just fall off
[2023-01-08 10:05:27] <+furballs> exercise needs to burn calories thou, not point if ur just going through the motions
[2023-01-08 10:05:28] <%$Jimwh0> Outside seqHmm
[2023-01-08 10:05:36] <$Shreddedhobbit> You should try eating clean foods, simple diet change will help, like chicken breast, rice, vegetables. Also, if you can handle only water, cut out all caffeine and sugar drinks. Start small, my roommate has lost almost 100lbs, he stuck to his diet and workout regime and he looks completely different. You got this.
[2023-01-08 10:05:40] <wiggle_everytime_boop> eat veggies or drink water for snacks :)

[2023-01-08 10:08:53] <$Shreddedhobbit> That’s not bad at all, also, start lifting weights, stick with a workout plan, and also use a couple days to lift heavy if you can, if you don’t have heavy weights then do high reps, instead of 3 sets for 10-15 reps, try 6 sets of 20-30 reps. Lifting weights or using your body weight will help burn the fat, you’ll tone up before you bulk up.

[2023-01-08 12:12:16] <+InsaneDementor> I liked Blood Origins
[2023-01-08 12:12:29] <%Redwyrm> blood origin also very meh
[2023-01-08 12:12:41] <TrystnS> Its different, wasnt that bad imo
[2023-01-08 12:12:47] <ElectricKnight> It's a shame IMHO. I love that movie. They could have made a great series, but I think they made a mistake taking this approach and attitude with it.
[2023-01-08 12:12:50] <PKM4STER> well they followed the books word for word for GoT
[2023-01-08 12:12:52] <ElectricKnight> It's too camp.

[2023-01-08 12:14:37] <%$huntbroncos> Nah Origiinal Willow was "dark"
[2023-01-08 12:14:38] <Scott_Buckley> the new show I mean
[2023-01-08 12:14:47] <Scott_Buckley> @huntbroncos yeah what he said
[2023-01-08 12:14:47] <+Droviin> There was a lot of camp in Willow. Mad Martigan was quite funny.  That said, the overall tone was one of dark
[2023-01-08 12:14:51] <%Spidersfury> Rewatch Willow, there are little things that carry over into the new series. Just my opinion.
[2023-01-08 12:14:56] <%$huntbroncos> Alot of the show we grew up with are
[2023-01-08 12:14:56] <ElectricKnight> WIllow the movie has a sense of FUN, but it takes itself seriously as well.
[2023-01-08 12:15:01] <Avalon_scorpion> old one was silly to
[2023-01-08 12:15:15] <@%Stonefather> This goes to my whole rant about how writers say I can do it better and end up making a subpar show.
[2023-01-08 12:15:15] <+Tic_tac217> shows today are built for the 'modern' audience
[2023-01-08 12:15:40] <+PierogiesAndKielbasa> Idk a moment in Willow that wasn’t silly once you’re past the start and before the end.
[2023-01-08 12:15:42] <@%Xorshasia> Willow was not really a good person in the movie. Sure, in the end, he sorta saved the day, but he did a lot of shady shit. LOL
[2023-01-08 12:15:43] <ElectricKnight> @Tic_tac217 In marketing speak, that's their goal, but in reality, it doesn't really work.

[2023-01-08 12:16:10] <DrayenKolzaar> when i watched willow as a kid, i remember being so scared of jean marsh evil witch
[2023-01-08 12:16:18] <ElectricKnight> @Tic_tac217 Right. I figured that was what you meant as well. :D
[2023-01-08 12:16:19] <%Spidersfury> I think he means that anyone who watches Willow currently, they are going to have a hard time understanding what the hell is going on. If you never watched the original movie, you are gonna be lost and start shaming the series.
[2023-01-08 12:16:21] <SirBeefie> modern show writers think "modern audience" has short attention span so they don't do as much detail work in favor of flashy stuff

[2023-01-08 12:26:27] <Azaes> they should bring back some more ancient old republic mando lore. reference the whole first sith empire. that was SOOOO intertwined with the mandalorian/jedi conflict
[2023-01-08 12:26:41] <starmachine24> Of course they don't do evil, they are the "good" guys
[2023-01-08 12:27:00] <+Zomaks> This is the way... it doesn't mean anything to Boba.

[2023-01-08 12:27:53] <%Redwyrm> @BurkeBlack It actualy makes me worried about second season about Andor. As they kinda will try to turn Rebels from ruthless terrorist they are in first season, into that nonsense how they become in core Star Wars. Suddenly all honorable and good, and still somehow manages to fight Empire.

[2023-01-08 12:41:22] <@%Stonefather> Once 99% of the Jedi were dead and he basically had an irongrip is sorta just decided to do a whole a lot of nothing.
[2023-01-08 12:41:22] <Azaes> "bring me unlimited toiletpaper!"
[2023-01-08 12:41:26] <+Zomaks> Star Wars is based on historical lessons of government rule, how they got started, and how the become oppressive. It always happens.
[2023-01-08 12:41:42] <%Redwyrm> he is well aware about "stick and carrot" :) He surely prefer using tsick more, but absolutely uses carrot as well :) @BurkeBlack

[2023-01-08 12:42:38] <yodalaidosama> Vader was known for still being an emotional wreck and sporadic as he was still conflicted with his decision even decades later
[2023-01-08 12:42:39] <%Spidersfury> @Stonefather Continue to kill off the rebellion, and any chance a straggler jedi was out there.
[2023-01-08 12:43:00] <%ThaneDarksong> "Don't do anything dumb around me..." (Makes choking hand motions" - Vader
[2023-01-08 12:43:03] <%Spidersfury> Which, for the most part he did
[2023-01-08 12:43:11] <%+Enigmal> Vader had a very good friendship with Admiral Piet
[2023-01-08 12:43:24] <kasded> NODDERS
[2023-01-08 12:43:33] <%+Jannison28> Loved that scene in the show
[2023-01-08 12:43:42] <%Spidersfury> The sentimental part of me hated how Anakin said that to Obi Wan :(
[2023-01-08 12:43:42] <%general_hotas> Why was Vader subservient to Gran Moff Tarkin tho
[2023-01-08 12:43:46] <%Redwyrm> he hated failures. So been around Vader and not been at 100% of his expectation was bad for you. So obviosly officers suffered more @BurkeBlack
[2023-01-08 12:43:47] <%+Jannison28> That was one of the most emotional scenes in star wars for me
[2023-01-08 12:43:55] <%+Iceiz> well thats what he tells luke in eps 4

[2023-01-08 12:44:02] <Azaes> suppressing anakin is a daily choice
[2023-01-08 12:44:03] <yodalaidosama> he was so attached to his old life he kept the 501st around up until one captured jedi told them his real identity
[2023-01-08 12:44:29] <@%Stonefather> I mean that didn't really do much for him, sure hunting down the Jedi so they couldn't reestablish their order was just good military strategy but pretty sure he had no long term goals he sorta just became your run of the mill dictator and less Sith Lord.
[2023-01-08 12:44:30] <%general_hotas> I didnt hear any mercy when he said that
[2023-01-08 12:45:21] <%Spidersfury> We'll never know
[2023-01-08 12:45:27] <$Maltidas> I gotta be honest, I am missing half the movie series. Saw Phantom Menace, quit. Saw the first one of the last series with Rey, quit. Heard ALLLLL about the rest to save my time.
[2023-01-08 12:45:41] <+mefruk7> It is mostly arrogance
[2023-01-08 12:45:41] <starmachine24> Thats probably the case, liek a little bit of his old self was still there
[2023-01-08 12:45:47] <+killenjr> well vader did turn back to the good in the end they always said their was good in him

[2023-01-08 12:46:23] <yodalaidosama> not to mention his resentment and hatred for sidous/Palpatine for rebuilding him into a cyborg that felt constant immeasurable pain to fuel his allegiance to the dark side
[2023-01-08 12:46:27] <+Zomaks> But they character I liked and find most interesting in Andor couldn't swim!!!! damn it!!!

[2023-01-08 12:46:46] <%Spidersfury> When people question "Vader/Anakin", i just ask them to watch the last season of The Clone Wars animated series. That will break you down emotionally.
[2023-01-08 12:47:12] <yodalaidosama> his attachments are what turned him to the dark side, and in the end turned him back to the light
[2023-01-08 12:47:15] <@%Stonefather> Well that and the constant pain probably helped Keepo
[2023-01-08 12:47:51] <%+Shoggoth75> i read that more like an affirmation to convince himself there is no anakin left in him.... even if is not true

[2023-01-08 12:50:13] <metradon123> yeah, could have been way better, but you had directors too busy trying to erase other directors plot directions
[2023-01-08 12:50:30] <+Germloucks> last trilogy was just confused mediocre production hell crap
[2023-01-08 12:50:33] <yodalaidosama> kotor 2 really. I mean.  I see your point though
[2023-01-08 12:50:35] <kasded> @GGuts yeah the kotor series are "my" star wars
[2023-01-08 12:50:52] <+ExcuzezMes> "kids movies"
[2023-01-08 12:51:02] <%Redwyrm> IMO both Sith and Jedi flawed just becasue they defy oposite side of force so much. That both makes Jedi susceptible to Dark side just becasue they defy it all the time, never undestanding it, and never been able to build resitance to it. And Siths likewise by defying light side always in the end drives themselves into path of self-destruction. @BurkeBlack

[2023-01-08 12:54:31] <%jake_wu6410> This is true. She’s much better in season 7 than in Season 1 Clone  Wars.
[2023-01-08 12:54:32] <$Maltidas> @burkeblack I was 7 it the theaters for Star Wars. The original trilogies are a part of me. I was referring to the last six films.
[2023-01-08 12:54:41] <%StS_Deserte> How did you like "The Bad Batch"?
[2023-01-08 12:55:07] <+True_King_In_Yellow> whe she faces of against Vader gave me chills
[2023-01-08 12:55:08] <%Spidersfury> The last 4 episodes of The Clone Wars was a emotional nightmare. If you didn't get chills or even shed a tear, you are not human.
[2023-01-08 12:55:29] <%jake_wu6410> Oh yeah Season 2 Bad Batch already 2 episodes on Disney+

[2023-01-08 12:57:31] <%StS_Deserte> @BurkeBlack How did you like "The Bad Batch" even if there was no real main character interaction in it?
[2023-01-08 12:57:49] <+VilneeusSchoolmaster> It will be interesting …. Ahsoka is about her and Sabine trying to find Ezra Bridger
[2023-01-08 12:58:02] <Tyraidd> yeah they mixed up Dark Empire and Heir to the Empire.  Like Mt Taniss was at the end of Bad Batch
[2023-01-08 12:58:03] <%Spidersfury> @BurkeBlack Burke when Ahsoka approached the graveyard of helmets, dropped her sabers, that music....how did it make you feel?
[2023-01-08 12:58:05] <%Redwyrm> ...meh, knowing DIsney they most likely will kill Thrawn in teh end. But as long as they at least give him epic death, and good "journey", i am ok with that.
