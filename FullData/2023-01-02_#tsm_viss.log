[2023-01-02 15:49:56] <+TitaniumWalnut> They are called daylight lamps sporting 7000 kelvin. no LEDs since they don't give the full spectrum
[2023-01-02 15:50:01] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> I'm thinking of the ones that they claim helps with mood, especially during Winter months.

[2023-01-02 17:00:58] <%cheddar__shredder> does that mean they made the gulag teams less balanced?
[2023-01-02 17:01:24] <%TorwaK> My Gulag rate was around %80 before the patch. It's about %40 now.

[2023-01-02 17:46:22] <%BrunoCorrea22> but for FPS games, they don't need to be the best...
[2023-01-02 17:46:24] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> Wider soundstage.
[2023-01-02 17:46:44] <%+shadowghost117> Dead Spade remake will have better graphics obviously, but adding move accessible areas for exploring, a voice actor for the main character, no load screen interruptions, smarter AI/ more environmental to build jump scares and such, etc.  there’s some articles with write ups about what’s new.

[2023-01-02 17:48:03] <%fyrevalkyrie> And they break super easy. They’re garbage
[2023-01-02 17:48:14] <%+GringoSuave619> get yourself some decent studio headphones like dt770 pros and a standalone mic

[2023-01-02 17:48:20] <%+shadowghost117> I have A50’s but I think I screwed up my settings trying to adjust it because now I have no depth/direction when it comes to hearing stuff.

[2023-01-02 17:48:45] <%VS_Victor1> @shadowghost117 there is a button on the side to change that

[2023-01-02 18:05:51] <0ne_bullet> Just like in the old cods but in a battle royal that’s cool
[2023-01-02 18:06:04] <%BrunoCorrea22> I think they should not have put a minimum zone, should spawn as soon as you get all materials

[2023-01-02 18:06:41] <%fractaleyes> @BrunoCorrea22 agreed, only having like 15 people when you detonate is kinda lame
