[2023-01-05 17:34:33] <%M4RX_ttv> @dohrman87 You need to turn binaural off for it to work correctly
[2023-01-05 17:34:56] <%JaynisK> @IMuRkSI Dunno all the things it can mount, but it can mount at least one of the 30mm scope amounts which is good enough for a Vudu.

[2023-01-05 19:11:17] <%Bigbenzi> BC2 mp was great because they made all the maps just for rush and not tried to put every gamemode into every map and that made the whole gameplay just balanced and fun. You remember tagging helicopters with the dart? Hella good time

[2023-01-05 22:05:21] <+illsmosisyou> he also doesn't like the bag dropping
[2023-01-05 22:05:22] <%JippyUK> he hates the peaking and fact you need to drop your bag to be viable
[2023-01-05 22:05:23] <%vonarth> audio fix? waaaaat
[2023-01-05 22:05:26] <%+GotDink> he also doesnt dump his bag before a fight which helps alot with inertia
[2023-01-05 22:05:26] <%Deathsquito> theres no coming back
[2023-01-05 22:05:27] <%BackwoodsBiscuit> he does this every wipe though LUL
[2023-01-05 22:05:28] <DevilishCat> he was pretty upset so to say that you need a 3rd program to fix the audio, didn't wanna be part of that @Sequisha
[2023-01-05 22:05:32] <c0ldturk3y> It sounds like scavs are inside me
[2023-01-05 22:05:32] <ShadyEighty9> he hates having to drop his pack in anticipation of a fight after looting BS
[2023-01-05 22:05:37] <%Ironman_Live> people were even telling Summit how Sequ fixed it and he never tried it
[2023-01-05 22:05:37] <Kielix> is inertia only a problem because your low strength at the start makes it an issue?
[2023-01-05 22:05:43] <%BackwoodsBiscuit> well maybe not deleting stuff  but ya
[2023-01-05 22:05:46] <+shiftypow3rs> he does quit a lot kekw
[2023-01-05 22:05:50] <+afox1985> he was lean peaking to get info on someone in two story and got killed cuz he took like three steps instead of one due to inertia.
