[2023-01-02 10:24:20] <!%SereneSnake> @k3vlar12 I'm saying that rocks can become ground, or part of it. Ground itself can't become rocks.
[2023-01-02 10:24:21] VIEWERS: 126
[2023-01-02 10:24:45] <@%+Skarthe> The first pure Rock in the series was Sudowoodo in Gen 2; Gen 1 had a few Rocks that were other types from Ground (notably the fossils) but Onix, the Geodude line, and the Rhyhorn line were all Rock/Ground.
[2023-01-02 10:24:46] <@%$EsponMyst> If I pick up a piece of the ground, wouldn't it become a rock if it was hard enough?
[2023-01-02 10:25:14] <!%SereneSnake> Depends on the definition of 'rock'.

[2023-01-02 13:58:27] <%+Zithras2> You missed the kids randomly deciding to steal a train...and no one caring.  Because only the SECOND stolen train actually matters...

[2023-01-02 13:58:56] <@%TheInfamousBug> Maybe the first train was a decoy train to steal? They expect one to get stolen, but two? That's unacceptable.
[2023-01-02 13:59:07] <%$Lord_Nanfoodle> All trains should be suplexed.
