[2023-01-11 00:43:48] <+lentillbean> It’s probably just a visual glitch, those certainly can’t be graves.  This is lilsimsie we are talking about here.
[2023-01-11 00:43:48] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-11 00:43:53] <ang_sier> I didn't played in DDV in two weeks and I really want to play it now

[2023-01-11 00:44:57] <+FranqlysNumber1Fan> I came *this* close to buying Dreamlight Valley last night. But I can’t justify spending money on it when 1) it’s going to be free eventually and 2) we’re expecting our baby in like 2 months and babies are EXPENSIVE 😅 but I was so close to getting it last night lol

[2023-01-11 00:49:32] <%$Plourde4> The only problem with game pass, is it's hard to see all the games included. So a lot of the best games are buried deep

[2023-01-11 00:49:35] <%+darth_jesweak> have you done other legacy challenges besides not so berry?
