[2023-01-04 13:38:07] <ToddVO> It was really big when I visited Outer East Southrumplefordburgh.
[2023-01-04 13:38:08] <Graknorke> before they write on it it needs to be processed into a "quire"
[2023-01-04 13:38:22] <darkwolfn1> or a scroll
[2023-01-04 13:38:33] <%Brynjarbjorn> Hopefully we won't just make a boo
[2023-01-04 13:39:00] <Graknorke> as far as i can tell they literally just fold it up
[2023-01-04 13:39:04] <Graknorke> it's an archaic word
[2023-01-04 13:39:09] <%$agravicvoid> Processed into a quire, I think you need a library and a table in the library for a place to write?
[2023-01-04 13:39:09] <%PsychoI3oy> I don't even know what a quire is in English
[2023-01-04 13:39:12] <vanivan239586038183905213> Bogen?
[2023-01-04 13:39:15] <Graknorke> from latin
[2023-01-04 13:39:23] <+RebBr0wn> four sheets of paper or parchment folded to form eight leaves, as in medieval manuscripts.
[2023-01-04 13:39:26] <Graknorke> it's like a blank manuscript
[2023-01-04 13:39:27] <vanivan239586038183905213> think so
[2023-01-04 13:39:29] <darkwolfn1> after a 'quire' has been written on, it can be combined with a book binding to make a book
[2023-01-04 13:39:38] <%+heynayjay> it's like a manuscript, a group of sheets before being bound

[2023-01-04 13:45:29] <Graknorke> a book (codex) tells you how many pages the book is, whereas a scroll doesn't because it's a scroll
[2023-01-04 13:45:30] <Fortunos> wait how long is the list actually

[2023-01-04 13:46:01] <Fortunos> mine tends to get quite long as well but sometimes I get rid of old stuff, like when I'm giving that industry a break

[2023-01-04 13:46:10] <%+ListlessOnion> What do you mean by "you have to make all that stuff", I don't understand... jeszHmm
[2023-01-04 13:46:26] <Fortunos> I think people just make one-time orders when they want them to happen instead of setting up the conditions?
[2023-01-04 13:47:01] <ozspoz> Do you love DF because you get to make lists?
[2023-01-04 13:47:06] <Fortunos> I knew someone who didn't use the manager for years of playing in the classic version
[2023-01-04 13:47:18] <%+ListlessOnion> Well, "all of it" is an aweful lot in Dwarf Fortress... salfordsalSmug
[2023-01-04 13:47:22] <Fortunos> they taught me DF, I taught them abt the manager
[2023-01-04 13:47:26] <!%+Wrinxz> If we have <3 ???
[2023-01-04 13:47:43] <Fortunos> oh thank god for the suggested conditions. they're so gooooood
[2023-01-04 13:47:49] <ToddVO> If the work order list were short, the manager would have nothing to do, get bored, and get into mischief. Then his life would spiral out of control until he winds up homeless, sleeping outside in the gutters, and...oh...wait. We're still talking about Dwarf Fortress. Nevermind.

[2023-01-04 13:51:45] <%+ListlessOnion> I think ultimately the answer is that the list of work orders is lomg because you want it to be. There's nothing in the game that would make you "lose" if you don't have a library, or temples, or steel, etc...

[2023-01-04 14:37:40] <+DaysOfDoom> nope, just one tile

[2023-01-04 14:37:47] <%DiamondDestructe> i think the middel blcok can't be magma
[2023-01-04 14:37:49] <Graknorke> the middle tile has to be solid ground i think?
[2023-01-04 14:37:56] <darkwolfn1> otherwise you only need 1 magma square of at least 4/7 below on one of the outside 8 squares
[2023-01-04 14:37:57] <Luxal_Illumina> I think it might just have to be directly over the magma

[2023-01-04 14:43:32] <+DaysOfDoom> @DiamondDestructe exept the steel
[2023-01-04 14:43:34] <+DaysOfDoom> Steel and iron
[2023-01-04 14:43:39] <%Silvertunga> They are the tiniest animals who are always smiling and munch of leaves and it's the cutest and sweetest thing ever and I love them more than lunch <3
[2023-01-04 14:43:41] <Fortunos> steel and iron are magma-resistant
[2023-01-04 14:43:46] <ozspoz> yes Quokas are the cutest ever
[2023-01-04 14:43:51] <Graknorke> steel and iron and magma safe
[2023-01-04 14:43:56] <Graknorke> along with... glass i think?
[2023-01-04 14:44:04] <+DaysOfDoom> @DiamondDestructe I think steel still requires Coke/coal even in Magma smelter
[2023-01-04 14:44:09] <ToddVO> Quokkas are adorable
[2023-01-04 14:44:14] <ToddVO> Their smiles are so derpy.

[2023-01-04 14:45:07] <+DaysOfDoom> @2DKiri The game will only let you build the magma forge/other stuff with those materials, so what ever options it gives you are a ok
[2023-01-04 14:45:21] <+DaysOfDoom> Unless you set other rocks/things magma resistant
[2023-01-04 14:45:35] <Graknorke> pipes are for screwpumps

[2023-01-04 14:45:55] <ozspoz> Oh have you ever played Oxygen Not Included?
[2023-01-04 14:45:55] <darkwolfn1> a single tile of magma would be espsiacly hard to try and move.

[2023-01-04 14:46:18] <!%Phlamethrower> No pipes, you just dig a tunnel and flood that
[2023-01-04 14:46:20] <Graknorke> pipes are to make the pumps
[2023-01-04 14:46:29] <+flakougar> just pump through tunnel
[2023-01-04 14:46:44] <+DaysOfDoom> NGLone 7/7 stake of magma isnt really worth moving with a pump system
[2023-01-04 14:46:44] <+Gogo04> i know you can make wooden pipes. have not seen metal ones oddly. still new myself
[2023-01-04 14:47:34] <+DaysOfDoom> Gogo04 you can make metal ones
[2023-01-04 14:47:36] <darkwolfn1> i tried to move one of those single square magma. i ended up just spreading it out so thin it evaporated
[2023-01-04 14:47:39] <ozspoz> The way you think about things it would be fun to watch, is it in your Vids?

[2023-01-04 14:48:36] <darkwolfn1> then i embarked on a area with a volcano. had plenty of magma to move! magma moat for the win
[2023-01-04 14:48:45] <+Gogo04> my guys keep falling down pits on the surface and drowning. not sure how to cover the pits without adding floors to them
[2023-01-04 14:48:58] <+DaysOfDoom> There are things in the game that you have not encountered yet, so yea deep
[2023-01-04 14:49:20] <ozspoz> Ok thanks, well if you decide to play ONI again please let me know <3
[2023-01-04 14:49:21] <%Silvertunga> What you find in the deep? Mostly circular motion.

[2023-01-04 14:54:56] <+DaysOfDoom> @2dkiri is real eazy, if you click on smelter, theres a tab called work orders, you can set it there
[2023-01-04 14:54:56] <%DiamondDestructe> @svennifox well there is the blue candy stuff, but that is spoiler terretory
[2023-01-04 14:55:09] <svennifox> True
[2023-01-04 14:55:47] <+Laudatio> If you create the work order on the smelter itself. It'll only do that order at that smelter.

[2023-01-04 15:06:11] <+DaysOfDoom> quick minecart, make wooden minecart, make a small stockpile that the smelter outputs to, build a track from that stockpile to your main storage, use ramps to go Z-levels, put a stop at start and end of track, set up the cart to take from the smelters stockpile, and at the end the minecart to dump into your storage, you need track ends on both sides. You can set the dwarves to guide the minecart which shouldnt make it go too fast (I think)

[2023-01-04 16:35:53] <+slippry_john> A less micromangey option is to just have them making crafts all the time. You can always offload the crafts anytime a trader arrives.

[2023-01-04 16:36:16] <ademonicpeanut> Dwarves can die of old age. They just die of other things first usually
[2023-01-04 16:36:37] <Graknorke> dwarves have long natural lifespans, natural deaths are a loooong way down the most common causes

[2023-01-04 16:45:00] <koalatea_entertainment> a dwarven therapist is just a gnome
[2023-01-04 16:45:40] <Graknorke> you can handle having some unmet needs it's fine

[2023-01-04 16:45:43] <koalatea_entertainment> If they have too many tasks sometimes I think they get too busy to spend time doing stuff like going to temple and seeing family
[2023-01-04 16:45:46] <CeCeJay> You need temples dedicated to their favourite gods

[2023-01-04 16:45:53] <+Exoltik> A temple dedicated to no specific deity helps. Also giving each dwarf a chest and cupboard to store their belongings in their rooms. Smoothing and engraving also helps

[2023-01-04 16:46:27] <+Exoltik> Can also help to assign a burrow free of workshops or any other potential source of work so they can just relax for a bit, then suspend when low on drinks and food
[2023-01-04 16:46:41] <Graknorke> oh yeah hunters are miserable
[2023-01-04 16:46:43] <brrrako> hunters get caught in the rain a lot which they hate
[2023-01-04 16:46:49] VIEWERS: 485
[2023-01-04 16:46:50] <Graknorke> that's pretty unavoidable i think
[2023-01-04 16:47:06] <Graknorke> because they end up outside, sleeping in the dirt, don't eat in the dining room, etc etc
[2023-01-04 16:47:12] <koalatea_entertainment> if you have 100+ dwarves trying to use the same temples, there might  not be room. It might help to make dedicated temples to the most popular dieties so it isnt so crowded? Just spitballing here.
[2023-01-04 16:47:14] <brrrako> you could build a roof over the entire map but it's really time consuming and who wants to do something so troublesome
[2023-01-04 16:47:22] <+curry_murmurs> Don't be afraid to remove the job designations of overworked dwarves.    Once in a while you'll just get an incurable bastard of a dwarf, don't be afraid to imprison or banish terminal malcontents either.
[2023-01-04 16:47:43] <koalatea_entertainment> yes
[2023-01-04 16:47:55] <Graknorke> when you try to assign a temple it gives you a list
[2023-01-04 16:47:56] <vanivan239586038183905213> when you're designating temples, it tells you number of worshippers
[2023-01-04 16:48:04] <Joontte> If you go to the menu where you dedicate a temple to specific deities it will say how many followers they have
[2023-01-04 16:48:28] <intprop> It's DF. Unintuitive and painful, so nah, the list is not ordered by most followed :D
[2023-01-04 16:48:28] <ademonicpeanut> If you hover over them it shows how many followers, but its not ordered
[2023-01-04 16:48:42] <Graknorke> i don't think it's ordered, but the important ones have an extra bit of text bc they'll be the organised religions

[2023-01-04 16:49:32] <vanivan239586038183905213> DF has a way to go in terms of UI and quality of life stuff
[2023-01-04 16:49:35] <Graknorke> their long term mood is to do with memories, mostly
[2023-01-04 16:49:38] <RankStrailMan> do you want to assign an unhappy dwarf to a job?
[2023-01-04 16:49:40] <brrrako> if you want them to acquire an object you can look at his items and forbid a piece of clothing. If you have extra of that type he'll go pick up a new piece
[2023-01-04 16:49:41] <vanivan239586038183905213> imo
[2023-01-04 16:49:51] <+curry_murmurs> One spouse, two lovers, three children.

[2023-01-04 16:50:09] <darkwolfn1> classic DF had two mods, DFHack and DFTherapist that added quality of life stuff to help that. havent been ported to steam yet
[2023-01-04 16:50:30] <darkwolfn1> Apparently not all Dwarf needs are as impactfull as others. aquire object and being with family being lower impactful

[2023-01-04 16:51:11] <+curry_murmurs> Being with family can matter more to some than others but it'll be indicated in their description if that's the case.
[2023-01-04 16:51:29] <darkwolfn1> Acquire object happens when they are hauling crafts from one stock to another. I've never been able to get them to help themselves consistently...
[2023-01-04 16:51:38] <darkwolfn1> yeah, sometimes their family hasn't even migrated to your site
[2023-01-04 16:51:48] <emp_john_romero> some dwarfs will migrate with no family, but they'll still have that need, so it will never get filled unless they marry
[2023-01-04 16:51:57] <just_bees__> yes, it's extremely tedious
[2023-01-04 16:51:57] <emp_john_romero> its just a part of the dwarven condition
[2023-01-04 16:52:01] <+Exoltik> Best you can do for some is just try to give them enough nice things to offset it. Some Dwarves will just not be pleased regardless so you have to cut your losses
[2023-01-04 16:52:06] <brrrako> it can help to burrow just the tavern and have them relax there every now and then to socialize
[2023-01-04 16:52:06] <+curry_murmurs> The one you just looked at is having multiple simultaneous affairs so it's more their problem than yours.
[2023-01-04 16:52:09] <ademonicpeanut> I think sad dwarves are unavoidable tbh
[2023-01-04 16:52:26] <%JebusJebebus> yeah it's too much. In time I hope modders/new programmer can make huuuge QOL changes
[2023-01-04 16:52:26] <darkwolfn1> best cure for sad dwarves is apparently a base waterfall feature
[2023-01-04 16:52:29] <vanivan239586038183905213> that's the biggest difference between DF and RW for me. the sheer complexity and lack of user friendliness in DF makes all the info turn into "background noise" whereas RW does a much better job of letting you keep an overview
[2023-01-04 16:52:31] <+GolemOfTime> That's brilliant, thank you. Would you mind if I use a clip of you saying that in a video? I'm an editor for one of the streamers that participated in the event

[2023-01-04 17:19:17] <aarpia> claystone is a different stone yes, it'll be on the top layers

[2023-01-04 17:19:59] <%Neroxen_> Technically you only need like a single tile of sand for all of your sand needs
[2023-01-04 17:20:33] <aarpia> What are you trying to do? Make clay stuff? Kaolinite will work for that
[2023-01-04 17:20:57] VIEWERS: 498
[2023-01-04 17:20:58] <aarpia> So they will either use kaolinite rocks that you get from mining, or you can designate clay collection like sand collection from clay tiles
[2023-01-04 17:21:25] <aarpia> Yeah kaolinite is not claystone but it is a Clay Stone
[2023-01-04 17:21:30] <Graknorke> "clay stone" means a stone that is a kind of clay
[2023-01-04 17:21:39] <Graknorke> claystone is not a kind of clay
[2023-01-04 17:22:01] <+rockjitsu> you can collect clay like sand or mine it
[2023-01-04 17:22:02] <+booloodian> The clay needs to be collected from a designated area, just like sand does.
[2023-01-04 17:22:30] <Graknorke> not every map has clay on
[2023-01-04 17:22:58] <ademonicpeanut> It needs to be clay soil or wall, but that might not be on the map

[2023-01-04 17:33:59] <Graknorke> but silty clay loam isn't

[2023-01-04 18:10:50] <Graknorke> well, pickaxes are only in use by miners. so the number in use is only going to be as many miners as you've got at most

[2023-01-04 18:12:02] <Graknorke> military will only use pickaxes if you specifically tell them to, so you're good there

[2023-01-04 18:14:28] <Graknorke> @Supervriendje it's not exactly unheard of to turn civilian implements into weapons of war
[2023-01-04 18:14:45] <%+DarkPaladin037> pickaxes (iron, steel) are actually pretty effective against some types of monsters as well
[2023-01-04 18:14:46] <Supervriendje> @Graknorke Good point.
[2023-01-04 18:15:03] <%hi_im_meo> I think that the stream I was on continued broadcasting, but the "Followed Channels" area broke. Then, later, when I refreshed the entire thing was broken and I couldn't get back to the stream I was on. It might've been down for longer overall, but I wasn't impacted for hours

[2023-01-04 18:16:44] <+bjmunise> @Supervriendje you can't have dwarfs double-up tho, so miners can't use their civilian pickaxe for military pickaxe. I think it at least uses the same skill tho
