[2022-12-23 07:42:44] <!%$WrathOfCathy> nerf pls so i can win!
[2022-12-23 07:42:46] <!%$WrathOfCathy> waaaah
[2022-12-23 07:42:47] <%brightside2016> what should be the infinite then? still 7?
[2022-12-23 07:42:50] <!%$WrathOfCathy> etc etc
[2022-12-23 07:42:54] <%Impbloody> id like if arena had  like a buy 3 runs get 1 free kinda system at some point
[2022-12-23 07:43:05] <!%TeamAmerica> but its fucking boring
[2022-12-23 07:43:08] <!%TeamAmerica> he doesnt play much
[2022-12-23 07:43:09] <!%TeamAmerica> !
[2022-12-23 07:43:24] <!%kingcharles__69> the goats can be absolute sickos at times
[2022-12-23 07:43:25] <%Kaguyavn> yeah its true they dont play that often
[2022-12-23 07:43:43] <corpfox82> they should also remove arena cards never picked like the 3 mana 0/7 demon; +1 spell dmg.
[2022-12-23 07:44:06] <!%JuicyFunSauce> is that how i should feel?
[2022-12-23 07:44:12] <%Kaguyavn> they did try to do that before, banning the 4/3 that cant attack @corpfox82 but it seems they just stop doing that OMEGALUL
[2022-12-23 07:44:15] <!%JuicyFunSauce> idk how to feel anymore...
[2022-12-23 07:44:28] <%Kaguyavn> the goal should be to appease ME
[2022-12-23 07:44:32] <%tyb3riuss> another afk opponent TheIlluminati

[2022-12-23 07:44:49] <%^Nightbot> ESY16 just caught a Leavanny!
[2022-12-23 07:44:53] <corpfox82> @Kaguyavn true
[2022-12-23 07:45:27] <+Eranidor> but what do you think about DK in standard? Why does blizzard make DK one of the worsest classes in standard?
[2022-12-23 07:45:29] <Duhabadu> SeemsGood
[2022-12-23 07:45:34] <Quixdlm> Nerfing the class pick rate is probably just the easiest balance solution
[2022-12-23 07:45:36] <%Kaguyavn> I will say though, having bad cards in and make the best use of those turds is one skill in arena
[2022-12-23 07:45:54] <Quixdlm> Class card*
[2022-12-23 07:46:07] <@%gesticulate> my average has been 8-9 for the whole time, but I never quite get to 30 runs
[2022-12-23 07:46:14] <%Impbloody> i remember when i was an arena main about 3 years ago, and i had a 12 win meta, i played 1 arena and went 12 wins
[2022-12-23 07:46:34] VIEWERS: 696
[2022-12-23 07:46:37] <+KotoHiAme> Okay, then make the worse card better with antoher card to improve it.
[2022-12-23 07:46:54] <+dixploder> i mean fireball is objectively worse
[2022-12-23 07:47:00] <+dixploder> power creep needs to chill
[2022-12-23 07:47:25] <%Kaguyavn> objectively worse is the original version of that shaman card that deals 4 and heal 4
[2022-12-23 07:47:29] <+dixploder> oh true im dumb
[2022-12-23 07:47:41] <%Kaguyavn> fireball is better than deathstrike a lot of time
[2022-12-23 07:47:42] <!%kingcharles__69> power creep is fine if old cards get to go to the farm and live out their old age
[2022-12-23 07:47:45] <!%TeamAmerica> i had an opponent have 3 acolytes on board at the same time against me
[2022-12-23 07:47:47] <+dixploder> i just watch these days
[2022-12-23 07:47:47] <!%TeamAmerica> i did not win

[2022-12-23 07:52:40] <%Synastar> Hey Red did you ever read or watch any of the show His Dark Materials?
[2022-12-23 07:53:13] <+oompalife> Why doesn‚Äôt blizzard hire a leaderboard player to theorycraft arena before releases - seems like that would make sense
[2022-12-23 07:53:29] <KULIXIS> They have access to card stats though. Why not just give ‚Äúarena buffs‚Äù to the worst performing cards?
[2022-12-23 07:53:33] <!%JuicyFunSauce> me neither
[2022-12-23 07:53:48] <%blissteringcold> im pretty sure there is more than a conspiracy about cards desing, Im 99% sure, the switcheroo priest in wild was intended, I imagine everyone with average knowledge of the game thought about the minion with highest stats ever printed and charging boar
[2022-12-23 07:54:17] <!%JuicyFunSauce> there was a reason i played it for like 2 weeks when it first came out, and didnt pick it up until like 5 years later
[2022-12-23 07:54:34] VIEWERS: 725
[2022-12-23 07:55:06] <%blissteringcold> 1 mana 20/20

[2022-12-23 07:55:15] <!%JuicyFunSauce> as they shouldnt right?
[2022-12-23 07:55:32] <KULIXIS> I meant like if a card is 2 mana 0/7 make it a 2 mana 1/7 in arena.
[2022-12-23 07:56:10] <!%JuicyFunSauce> Ididnt pick this (HS) BACK up untill a few years ago
[2022-12-23 07:56:10] <%riftboynick> no shitty DK tickling each other
[2022-12-23 07:56:13] <%riftboynick> two
[2022-12-23 07:56:28] <KULIXIS> Just make it automatic. Like each week the worst performing cards get buffs.
[2022-12-23 07:56:34] VIEWERS: 725
[2022-12-23 07:56:46] <!%JuicyFunSauce> cause it wasnt just spider tank

[2022-12-23 07:58:34] VIEWERS: 696
[2022-12-23 07:58:48] <jwso_> if anything, they should re-introduce buckets for drafting and automate it accordingly
[2022-12-23 07:59:04] <jwso_> just make the buckets relatively large so that every deck doesn't end up the same
[2022-12-23 07:59:51] <+theASUdevil> herth or harth. lol who likes which one

[2022-12-23 08:00:09] <jwso_> the biggest issue is arena not making enough money for blizz
[2022-12-23 08:00:18] <%^Nightbot> help redbeard come up with some dumb titles for youtube https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx87TDgwE8L9Mqbs_2D5EjxpwKt2wdZglq8ukMyDHLUlDWDQ/viewform

[2022-12-23 08:02:43] <!%JuicyFunSauce> even now, i think a lot of people are not having fun if they can't rate a game 10/10... idk im not trying to start an argument or anything, but life is an experience, and a 5/10 experience doesn't mean it should be eradicated from all future human experience
[2022-12-23 08:03:01] <@%gesticulate> once you fill up a channel with more and more mods, it gets a bit unruly
[2022-12-23 08:03:05] <KULIXIS> Even if you don‚Äôt introduce a problem. You‚Äôll make some trade off early on and it makes things messier later.

[2022-12-23 08:09:01] <KULIXIS> Working retail makes you hate Christmas
[2022-12-23 08:09:11] <%+xhalterx> colder weather and less daylight definitely affects the mood on its own without taking other things into account

[2022-12-23 08:12:37] <+KotoHiAme> I was going to go into more detail, but I decided that I don't want to be doom and gloom.
[2022-12-23 08:12:50] <!%bert3326> I've always been a fan of holidays but these past few years I haven't been able to visit family or do anything with friends so it's been pretty lonely for me
[2022-12-23 08:12:56] <!%bert3326> but that's okay, it'll get better soon
[2022-12-23 08:12:58] <%Fyatistic> I worked at a Arts and Crafts store so we always got miserable folk who waited too long to start their projects :L
[2022-12-23 08:13:06] <%Synastar> Once you guys get to choose the family you want to live with and not the one your born with. Holidays change a bit

[2022-12-23 08:13:29] <!%JuicyFunSauce> its funny, im salary, and im choosing to work on christmas, so im not getting extra anything. ok now im convinced that something is wrong with me
[2022-12-23 08:13:50] <Kazoojisan> people just get depressed and sentimental when they think about childhood
