[2022-12-10 11:15:12] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> as in, if they are in your inventory they take direct damage, if they are on a gun, they only take damage when you shoot said gun

[2022-12-10 11:24:45] <%Psychoactivehaze> @kaptincaribe57 server owners can very easily adjust item economy, but by default the rarest would be any item with a max of 1 spawned at a time that is able to spawn in most parts of the map. on namalsk it would be the bubson record for example
[2022-12-10 11:24:46] <+prefab_trout> correct answer is Chuck
[2022-12-10 11:24:47] <%Goldfish_Sniper> lax and ben are the most aussie sounding

[2022-12-10 12:41:34] <%cpmilans_> rogue like?
[2022-12-10 12:41:34] <%+el_ruken91> I remember the first PVP video game I ever saw was in a arcade mortal Kombat 1 where you could play with other people from different arcades from the part of your area
[2022-12-10 12:41:46] <RellikOG> like when you die you loose everything @cpmilans_

[2022-12-10 12:42:49] <RellikOG> @cpmilans_ rouge like is when you play a life that builds as it goes and when you loose you reroll?
[2022-12-10 12:42:52] <SmokeyLBC> I think the first pvp style game I played for pc was delta force land warrior, was cool for bk in the day as it had its own map editor.
[2022-12-10 12:42:53] <lunaticwidow> @itsaamee he went south. we went east

[2022-12-10 12:43:20] <%cpmilans_> @RellikOG guess you could say that but it feels like a stretch somehow to call stalker or dayz a roguelike

[2022-12-10 12:50:53] <+toppa35> if you live in the UK Smoke streams are like Unicorn sightings at times
[2022-12-10 12:50:53] <force2brckndwit> smoke starts stream and 10 minutes later he has 4k viewers
[2022-12-10 12:50:57] <yorginn> sundays is your advantage
[2022-12-10 12:51:05] <%dabombzey> you are not a backup for Smoke
[2022-12-10 12:51:06] <%bigc4_25> I come for the commentary not the gameplay. But the gameplay is a plus.
[2022-12-10 12:51:10] <scratch_sniff11> Do you think if you maybe went to another popular game you could get upto 1K viewers?

[2022-12-10 12:53:10] <scratch_sniff11> I think if I ever wanted to take up dayZ streaming i would use a tiktok to bring in viewers i play on console and see a few people have a quite a big following from console account but don’t stream

[2022-12-10 13:09:43] <Bambo_oZlr> yeah, it's just cultural
[2022-12-10 13:09:44] <Bunclap> animals are friend not food
[2022-12-10 13:09:44] <Pin_die> it's logic but normal humans do not think rationally.

[2022-12-10 13:10:04] <crudman1233> wouldnt u agree the fact we're desensitised to eating animals in the first place is a disconnection in your brain?
[2022-12-10 13:10:07] <cougne> horse meat is good

[2022-12-10 13:11:07] <%CiggyFreudd> eating meat isn't evil. factory farming is fucked.
[2022-12-10 13:11:08] <%yanyesnaya> if you had pet cows, you'd prolly feel gross about it.  u only feel that way about dogs bc they're ubiquitous
[2022-12-10 13:11:09] <Nuffy76> cows entire purpose is to be food for humans

[2022-12-10 13:12:12] <yournansbowl> A 1 ton animal, that does nothing but sit in a field eating grass, to give off pounds of meat. Kinda feels like evolution put it there for consumption tbf
[2022-12-10 13:12:14] <Nuffy76> cows chicken pigs etc are created to be food . full stop
[2022-12-10 13:12:30] <+antCpants> what is th is "created"

[2022-12-10 13:12:41] <josie_posie_> its not about a natural order, producing meat is extremely ineffectient and resource consuming. yeah it tastes great but its not sustanable sadly
[2022-12-10 13:12:42] <lunaticwidow> @yournansbowl you aint wrong
[2022-12-10 13:12:52] <yournansbowl> @josie_posie_ This is the truth

[2022-12-10 13:17:54] <%+drifter_hp> still not more painful than watching high saturation dayz streams
[2022-12-10 13:17:57] <BurberryBloodstains> The CGI in way of the water is revolutionary though I can attest to that
[2022-12-10 13:18:01] <lunaticwidow> @altruizine77 thats the problem... waste
[2022-12-10 13:18:05] <Altruizine77> @lunaticwidow but would you be willing to go mostly vegetarian to reclaim all the wasted farmland used for cattle?
[2022-12-10 13:18:06] <josie_posie_> @lunaticwidow I aort agree but I believe the earth could sustain even more people if our food production was better planned and didnt destroy top soil at the rate it is
[2022-12-10 13:18:07] <Pin_die> but I am cringe kaitiacCrackHead
[2022-12-10 13:18:14] <Nuffy76> check out the movie nobody

[2022-12-10 13:18:43] <tex_the_squeakypig> practical effects will ALWAYS trump CGI
[2022-12-10 13:18:44] <%CiggyFreudd> THAT'S WHY THEY KEEP DOING THIS

[2022-12-10 13:19:10] <BurberryBloodstains> Transformers Kappa
[2022-12-10 13:19:20] <yournansbowl> a 1440p trailer cant compared to the 8k cinema experience or 4k viewing tho, which its probably built for
[2022-12-10 13:19:30] <BurberryBloodstains> It’s meant for IMAX
[2022-12-10 13:19:31] <Pin_die> Furry animals
[2022-12-10 13:19:33] <%+CrossGraves> They did a good job with harold in ghostbusters afterlife
[2022-12-10 13:19:35] <DelTree_> zootopia is a brilliant film
[2022-12-10 13:19:44] <tex_the_squeakypig> filmmaking needs to invest more in practical effects versus CGI.
[2022-12-10 13:19:46] <%CiggyFreudd> who gives a fuck how shiny the turd is
[2022-12-10 13:19:57] <BurberryBloodstains> The trailer wasn’t that great. It’s also a set up for the 3rd movie so that’s kinda lame
[2022-12-10 13:20:01] <The_Warpath> CereScream
[2022-12-10 13:20:02] <neXday> ceremor furry confirmed
[2022-12-10 13:20:07] <BULLD0G5> plus they gotten so lazy with CGI aswell
[2022-12-10 13:20:07] <%just_call_me_proddy> @RaggedFlag It was a place call Black Market. It was constantly getting robbed by the mafia
[2022-12-10 13:20:09] <BakedKipling> there was a trailer for a upcoming game that looked like a fps horror, had a robot like the irobot films cant remeber the name. that cgi looked great
[2022-12-10 13:20:10] <tex_the_squeakypig> 3D movies are terrible
[2022-12-10 13:20:13] <yournansbowl> I do wish wed go back to Lord of the rings style practical effects
[2022-12-10 13:20:16] <+Toasted_Fox> CGI ruins a film. Case study Lord of the rings VS the hobbit
[2022-12-10 13:20:16] <josie_posie_> anyone remember "After Earth"? worst cgi Ive ever seen
[2022-12-10 13:20:19] <yournansbowl> that stuff was the best
[2022-12-10 13:20:21] <%$LordoftheJungl3> what even is a Na'vi
[2022-12-10 13:20:24] <BurberryBloodstains> We were shooting the 2nd 3rd and flashbacks for the 4th movie the whole time I was there
[2022-12-10 13:20:24] <patdoggg> practical effects FTW
[2022-12-10 13:20:29] <%RaggedFlag> @just_call_me_proddy Wtf Australia has Mafia?
[2022-12-10 13:20:31] <%lLuX_> most newer movies suck because they are trying to target a too big audience
[2022-12-10 13:20:32] <@%snuffles_> when i watched the trailer for avatar2 the kid reminded me of chucky's kid in seed of chucky
[2022-12-10 13:20:39] <Nuffy76> interstellar i have watched prolly   8 times. the soundtrack in that movie is top shelf
[2022-12-10 13:20:43] <Manoleitor_Arg> The hobbit was SHIT
[2022-12-10 13:20:47] <Manoleitor_Arg> SHIT man
[2022-12-10 13:20:50] <%CiggyFreudd> what a pile of shit

[2022-12-10 13:20:52] <+Toasted_Fox> it was absolute shite
[2022-12-10 13:20:55] <yournansbowl> hobbit 1 and 2 was fun, but it looked so off
[2022-12-10 13:21:00] <crudman1233> the first hobbit was good
[2022-12-10 13:21:00] <tex_the_squeakypig> Jackson wanted to try out his new 48fps camera
[2022-12-10 13:21:00] <%CiggyFreudd> only movie I ever walked out of was the first hobbit
[2022-12-10 13:21:03] <%$LordoftheJungl3> saw the first one, never finished them
[2022-12-10 13:21:09] <+Toasted_Fox> Ring of power did it right
[2022-12-10 13:21:18] <mofizl> I thought the hobbit was awesome
[2022-12-10 13:21:20] <Manoleitor_Arg> Ring of power is also shit imo
[2022-12-10 13:21:25] <%$be_h2o> I never watched any lotr
[2022-12-10 13:21:26] <DelTree_> when i first played Max Payne and the bullet time fkin blew me away was insane

[2022-12-10 13:33:38] <Wookie042> @CiggyFreudd Nice, def gonna listen to that
[2022-12-10 13:33:44] <%just_call_me_proddy> Back when DAYZ mod, first came out. I'd often roll with a squad of 10 to 20 players. Is that a rare occurrence now?
[2022-12-10 13:33:49] <Altruizine77> That's legit. Cameron's decided to make shit movies that will make money to fund his massive ambitions pushing tech forward
[2022-12-10 13:34:10] <%cpmilans_> running to fren
[2022-12-10 13:34:11] <KILLER__MOOSE> It happens every time Cornbread is online
[2022-12-10 13:34:20] <+Toasted_Fox> is there a way for dayz not reverting to iron sights when ads'ing
[2022-12-10 13:34:33] <%cpmilans_> and its our job to kill the big groups
[2022-12-10 13:35:12] <+thedyingmanb> bingusd these days reggie is no more
[2022-12-10 13:35:19] <%+gmazza11> @toasted_fox scroll
[2022-12-10 13:35:25] <+prefab_trout> when i first started playing Dayz i bumped into Cornbread in Livonia and he was a perfect gentleman with this noob. Got me hookoed. Top guy.
[2022-12-10 13:35:27] <BurberryBloodstains> Has dayone ever made a group size limit?
[2022-12-10 13:35:34] <+toppa35> @Toasted_Fox melee with it, its a bit buggy rn
[2022-12-10 13:35:43] <%+itsAaMee> Sadge when you kill a geared streamer their views go down 📉
[2022-12-10 13:35:48] <crispicus_> its ok to team up but its DayZ at the end of the day.   watched benfruit smoke jacky the frenchy yesterday and it was all good despite them being buds
[2022-12-10 13:35:49] <+Toasted_Fox> aye i know, but whenever I've been going back in, its back to iron sight..oh is that a bug?
[2022-12-10 13:35:59] <neXday> yeah like why limit groups
[2022-12-10 13:36:02] <yournansbowl> Big groups create the best content
[2022-12-10 13:36:11] <neXday> people would be in a group irl
[2022-12-10 13:36:12] <yournansbowl> trying to take the many people out is so fun
[2022-12-10 13:36:16] <%BiotechGodzilla> What happened to Distopian?  He has not been on for a  month.
[2022-12-10 13:36:19] <%WooshBlammo> dayz with rules, booooo
[2022-12-10 13:36:23] <@%Vellitrix> theyre counterplaying themselves by running that big Smadge
[2022-12-10 13:36:44] <KILLER__MOOSE> The grenade launcher being in the game wrecks that argument now.
[2022-12-10 13:36:50] <BurberryBloodstains> Yeah without the UI it’s pretty hard to keep track of who’s who
[2022-12-10 13:36:57] <%yanyesnaya> zactly
[2022-12-10 13:36:59] <%CiggyFreudd> bigger the group, the more kills you get with a nade
[2022-12-10 13:37:05] <%cpmilans_> u can put a nade in their fire ez hectakill widepeepoHappy
[2022-12-10 13:37:07] <bubbaparks21> who am i
[2022-12-10 13:37:12] <%+itsAaMee> you can gun whack them and then loot their body oh wait
[2022-12-10 13:37:35] <%Panlenka> not kean then lol
[2022-12-10 13:37:40] <%lLuX_> and you can, even if you die, count it as success if you kill atleast half of such big groups
[2022-12-10 13:37:54] <+prefab_trout> @Ceremor would you be averse to the ability to stealth kill players like Zombies with a knife?

[2022-12-10 13:38:51] <%BiotechGodzilla> I remember when you threw a nade in a room and killed Aandy and three other dudes.
[2022-12-10 13:38:51] <canfiiax> @ceremor are you having a good day?
[2022-12-10 13:38:58] <BurberryBloodstains> Ceremor has never not spoken his exact thoughts
[2022-12-10 13:38:58] <%cpmilans_> do we hear shuffles
[2022-12-10 13:39:01] <+Toasted_Fox> I think it would be kinda cool for an animation to walk like a zombie
[2022-12-10 13:39:06] <yournansbowl> what if a gunwhack from behind, started from stealth, is a free knock
[2022-12-10 13:39:07] <+toppa35> @Sneddjeddjevv ceremoR
[2022-12-10 13:39:19] <yournansbowl> like when you wack someone on the back of the head

[2022-12-10 13:42:01] <%cpmilans_> 180 no scope because fire axes dont have scope railing
[2022-12-10 13:42:06] <yournansbowl> I thought last patch or whatever removed the looking behind + attacking?
[2022-12-10 13:42:10] <Good_Vibes> They call it an Xbox 360 because you see it and do a 360 and walk away
[2022-12-10 13:42:17] <RellikOG> so you can charge a running attack by running away the swing around with the same extended range?
[2022-12-10 13:42:18] <yournansbowl> or did they bring it back?
[2022-12-10 13:42:20] <catzcatz> need to do like a 920 running power attack for more anime feel
[2022-12-10 13:42:23] <+Timehz93> do a 180 quick No scope Headshot on a Zombie

Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

[2022-12-10 14:16:08] <%+nippless_cage912l> Danny, at the start of an operational tour to Afghanistan or Iraq in the British army we would have a presentation with pictures of all the catastrophic in there injuries suffered by British soldiers to make us aware of what could happen to us and this used to last about 2-3 hours
[2022-12-10 14:16:14] <%just_call_me_proddy> Don't blow your shotguns
[2022-12-10 14:16:23] <%LTSilk> No as i feel my answer could incriminate me
[2022-12-10 14:16:26] <%+el_ruken91> I wonder what's the last thing that goes through their mind when they blow their heads off with a shotgun the pellets?
[2022-12-10 14:16:38] <zoidelux> How do you have such good reach w axe ? Can you explain it? The running melee attack
[2022-12-10 14:16:39] <+thedyingmanb> honestly the suicide shootings were even haunting

[2022-12-10 14:17:55] <SilentFoot7> You guys think the vss should get a little buff?
[2022-12-10 14:18:16] <%+nippless_cage912l> I always found it weird seeing all those catastrophic injuries and then having to go out on patrol and get it out of your mind @panlenka
[2022-12-10 14:18:19] <rangervc> i think suit and gauss need a buff

[2022-12-10 14:20:17] <douxlo> I wish someone made a Namalsk 2
[2022-12-10 14:20:24] <rangervc> nobody uses gauss anymore, for how rare it is i think they could it least make lighter/smaller
[2022-12-10 14:20:29] <+Toasted_Fox> i just say fuck it, ak all the way
[2022-12-10 14:20:44] <+thedyingmanb> gas zone loot

[2022-12-10 16:37:59] <Cypress__Stoned> THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, before the dawn of man as we knew him, there was Sir Santa of Claus, an ape-like creature making crude and pointless toys out of dinobones and his own waste, hurling them at chimp-like creatures with crinkled hands regardless of how they behaved the previous year. These so-called "toys" were buried as witches, and defecated upon, and hurled at predators when wakened by the searing grunts of children. It wasn't a holly jolly Christmas that year. For many were killed.
