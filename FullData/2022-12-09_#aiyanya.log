[2022-12-09 09:19:16] <%jallyman55> i think it started from getting the Japanese convinced that chicken can used to replace turkey for Thanksgiving since turkey is not readily available in Japan at the time (and still probably isnt)

[2022-12-09 10:39:57] <@%Dark_Fable> @aiyanya so From Software made Dark Souls series right. Well before Souls games they made a Mecha game series with 23 games in it so far. Then since Souls took of we haven't gotten a new game in 10 years

[2022-12-09 11:06:44] <@%Dark_Fable> For your questions earlier: Armored Core was From Software's original main series, 23 games, 3rd person mecha action. Hasn't been one since PS3. Daemon X Machina is a game by some former Armoured Core devs on the Switch/PC. Not as good due to indie game but still fun
[2022-12-09 11:07:14] <@%^StreamElements> Thank you for following plausiblecake aiyaWave
[2022-12-09 11:07:14] <%DragonofEternity> probably not

[2022-12-09 11:07:57] [Points] MiyaMewrilee redeemed Text to Speech (1 000) [So the cat is named after a greek mythologist that studied the art of dancing. The dancer was called Tymbaltious the 3rd and was seen as one of the greatest dancers in all of greece. But one day he was met by the 6 gods and gave him the chance to do his best dance performance if he wants a seat in the gods. In the end he danced and I made all this shit up and none of it is true.]

I tried to tell him I can't until I get to a save point but he didn't understand what then means so he turned off the console. I lost 3 hours of gameplay

[2022-12-09 12:38:27] <@%Dark_Fable> @rhaegarr7 while true I think mistborn lends better to a game, Imagine a victorian style town open world and your just using the metal powers to sneak around town

[2022-12-09 13:47:35] <AlfaAnanas> Who is Aiya? For the blind, She is the vision. For the hungry, She is the chef. For the thirsty, She is the water. If Aiya thinks, I agree. If Aiya speaks, I’m listening. If Aiya has one fan, it is me. If Aiya has no fans, I don’t exist.
