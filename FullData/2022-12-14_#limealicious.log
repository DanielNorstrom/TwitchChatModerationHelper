[2022-12-14 00:00:17] <%AK_Zephyr> cage traps let you start a zoo
[2022-12-14 00:00:19] <digitaladam123> weapons and cage traps are great
[2022-12-14 00:00:20] <+BottleGnomes> cage traps can capture stuff
[2022-12-14 00:00:31] <digitaladam123> cage traps allow you to have prisoners, useful for lots of things

[2022-12-14 00:00:42] <bayronbunbun> you can sell them for profit, if ethics don't bother you
[2022-12-14 00:00:45] <WishingOnAWendy> build an arena ofc
[2022-12-14 00:00:51] <HonoluluRoscoe> goblins aren't sentient beings

[2022-12-14 00:01:13] <smaug133> @AngyBears candy-ammo storage? are we going to shoot our enemies too fat to fight?
[2022-12-14 00:01:18] <%TsunamiAromatic> It might entertain some people
[2022-12-14 00:01:21] <%AK_Zephyr> do you have mugs for your tavern? and someone assigned to bartend?
[2022-12-14 00:01:27] <DevinChadde> @TsunamiAromatic It is so much worse when they get stuck because of you. If they can get stuck on trees, there's no reason to give them opportunity to get stuck on your stuff
[2022-12-14 00:01:27] <@%Kovubot> limesSip
[2022-12-14 00:01:27] <+moldisgold> you can capture goblins and make your dwarves beat the naked goblins up with training weapons if you wanna get fancy
[2022-12-14 00:01:43] <%MeleeTechie> You want beds? We'll give you beds limesComfy
[2022-12-14 00:01:48] <%MotherLouve> Hello lime !

[2022-12-14 00:03:25] <+BottleGnomes> you can turn on a framerate counter in the settings
[2022-12-14 00:03:34] <DevinChadde> You can actually enable FPS display in the game's options

[2022-12-14 00:03:54] <!%Laimubot> Kratos has taught me that this was a dash button, I think?
[2022-12-14 00:04:00] <smaug133> it may be time to make sacrifices to the god of blood for fps!

[2022-12-14 00:21:42] <%Charronia> Jewel-encrusted everything does make your fortress look stylish as heck though
[2022-12-14 00:21:48] <GoodJobDog> You can make the jeweler only take from a specific stockpile that doesn't allow doors and stuff
[2022-12-14 00:21:49] <HonoluluRoscoe> @Limealicious I think you can micromanage which things get encrusted.

[2022-12-14 00:21:59] <%TsunamiAromatic> Bling on everything
[2022-12-14 00:22:03] <+PhoenixSundae> You'd assign a furniture stockpile to the jeweler's shop, and that shop will only encrust what you put in there

[2022-12-14 00:22:38] <%TsunamiAromatic> You can force that workshop to only take from certain stockpiles
[2022-12-14 00:22:42] <bayronbunbun> that's been a problem forever, but the only solution is still to make a new stockpile with its own gem orkshop that only takes from the stockpile

[2022-12-14 20:42:55] <%Apocalypse1950> Good luck with not needing new pokemon in future games, because new pokemon means new lines of merchandise, and thats where the money is.
[2022-12-14 20:42:57] <%scithechatot> basically didn't play any DS era?

[2022-12-14 20:43:21] <@%Greygull> so I learned about IV breeding and EV training
[2022-12-14 20:43:21] <%Ballermar> i only played spinoffs growing up until White, and then skipped to Moon, and never played another one

[2022-12-14 21:02:48] <samiam1616> also the shiny boost for sandwiches needs rarer ingredients I think?

[2022-12-14 21:06:56] <+Dozyderp> very much a post game thing, but if you combine the kill chain with a sandwich and the shiny charm you can lower the shiny odds to like 1/600 or somewhere around that
[2022-12-14 21:06:59] <%Ultima_Weapon02> limes can raise her B teamo on the bodies of dead dreepy

[2022-12-14 21:07:12] <@%TheLawlDawg> The game will say "The number is definitely getting lower" and that's when you should stop and just ride around to spawn a shiny

[2022-12-14 21:07:42] <%Apocalypse1950> Eh, the messages show up anywere from 25-30 and 50-55 or so, so I guess just overshoot a little since the outbreak doesnt disperse unless you kill over 100 or so

[2022-12-14 21:17:55] <%Ultima_Weapon02> i  mean i never hunt until i get the shiny charm typically, if i happen across one in normal play im lucky
[2022-12-14 21:17:57] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Don't think you need bread... just set up picnic and leave picnic.
[2022-12-14 21:17:57] <smaug133> but what if a shiny would spawn in the water just after you left, which you did early because you were wasting time on the wall the whole time!
[2022-12-14 21:17:59] <%Ultima_Weapon02> yes
[2022-12-14 21:17:59] <azure_dunes> nice and functional pokemon game :)

[2022-12-14 21:18:02] <%jell_y_> Probably that
[2022-12-14 21:18:05] <%AngyBears> Would only reset their spawns. Which is the goal when shiny hunting.
[2022-12-14 21:18:13] <+Dozyderp> do you NEED the picks though?
[2022-12-14 21:18:18] <%MotionlessPoetry> picnic time
[2022-12-14 21:18:28] <%Apocalypse1950> Not to my knowledge, thats how I hunted a dolphin outbreak because you cant picnic on the water and it was like a thirty second climb or surf back to picnicable land lol
[2022-12-14 21:18:28] <@%TheLawlDawg> NOW you can just ride around and despawn the regular ones until a shiny spawns
[2022-12-14 21:18:39] <wawawaaaario> I planning to make party with full of Violet colored pokemons
[2022-12-14 21:18:39] <%AngyBears> When you get that message its best to camp and uncamp to respawn. You've maxed your shiny odds.
[2022-12-14 21:18:40] <%Somazure> about 10-15 more and should be enough for max adds
[2022-12-14 21:18:47] <%Ultima_Weapon02> You can leave and come back so long as the internal clock doesnt tick over to the following day on your switches internal clock @Limealicious

[2022-12-14 21:20:23] <jacez1> All this effort and the shiny is just gonna spawn inside the wall FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-14 21:20:27] <%AngyBears> Yeah just despawn them over and over. Picnics despawn them.

Now they're trying to figure all the people stealing their shit; the CEO's novel idea is to either raise prices or close stores outright - customers are blatantly telling them though it's the self-checkout. andyClown

[2022-12-14 22:45:56] <%Apocalypse1950> Psyshock hits physical defense, so it can help stop you from being walled
[2022-12-14 22:46:02] <%F00BAD00> psyshock is better because it hits defense instead of special defense

[2022-12-14 22:46:02] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Depends. Psyshock hits physical defense while using special attack.
[2022-12-14 22:46:03] <%Terravir> psyshock i think counts as both physical and special

[2022-12-14 23:27:45] <%thatcrazycrabs> Also it's just an awesome sounding move: MOON BLAST

[2022-12-14 23:28:27] <+Dozyderp> pixilate basically makes it a STAB move
[2022-12-14 23:28:27] <%thatcrazycrabs> 20% tho it used to be 30% in X and Y and, I think, in Sun and Moon
[2022-12-14 23:28:28] <%$Zotiza> I imagine modest?
[2022-12-14 23:28:29] <%kepheru446> modest would probs be good

[2022-12-14 23:31:00] <%Ultima_Weapon02> Well throat spray will give you a permenant special attack boost until switch out so it will boost all your moves after hyper voice is used

[2022-12-14 23:40:05] <%$sirmao> People wanted platinum remake
[2022-12-14 23:40:06] <+Buttrush_Omega> they were 1:1 remakes with no extra content
[2022-12-14 23:40:06] <JSKWilson> They were literally the exact same code as the originals but now with a worse art style and lag
[2022-12-14 23:40:06] <%thatcrazycrabs> the only thing I remember being worth it in it was the Underground and that the frame rate/pacing was better than OG Diamond Pearl
[2022-12-14 23:40:10] <%$Zotiza> @Crkokinda Welcome back limesHi
[2022-12-14 23:40:13] <%Tirien66> not even proper remakes, they were shitty remasters with bad graphics
[2022-12-14 23:40:14] <+Mario1080p> not sure why you stopped, might have been something released?
[2022-12-14 23:40:15] <%thatcrazycrabs> Do you remember your team at all in them?
[2022-12-14 23:40:16] <Ediialex> they got released just before legends arceus so that's why they were forgotten so fast
[2022-12-14 23:40:16] <!%+Tene> exactly
[2022-12-14 23:40:19] <%JoJo0217> because you couldnt handle the vaseline camera

[2022-12-14 23:50:41] <samiam1616> I'm afraid you missed a single tomato so it isn't an official recipe
[2022-12-14 23:50:42] <%efflora> you can! i made a sandwich with a fuckton of cheeeeeese

[2022-12-14 23:51:30] <%u1849ka> Putting the hamburger and the potato salad next to each other like that is the same energy as people that put burrito ingredients horizontally instead of vertically down the length of it.

[2022-12-14 23:52:59] <Table__9> @mochi_bird idk how truth/ideals is a good dichotomy when the known truth of the pokemon world is its a utopia with free Healthcare and children have no worries. PETA could never exist in this world or be taken seriously imo

[2022-12-14 23:53:01] <mochi_bird> i still wish they would give us a regional dratini line that goes for a matched finale
[2022-12-14 23:53:03] <jumpybob5> the dragonite line goes Cute -> Elegant -> Doofus
[2022-12-14 23:53:06] <%+MenardiGames> dragonair looks so cool... and then you get... dragonite
