[2022-12-22 20:21:34] <%Ultrasoniicc> The tradition may come from a custom in the late Roman/early Christian era wherein alms boxes placed in churches were used to collect special offerings tied to the Feast of Saint Stephen,[7] which, in the Western Christian Churches, falls on the same day as Boxing Day, the second day of Christmastide. On this day, it is customary in some localities for the alms boxes to be opened and distributed to the poor.[1][8] monkaS

[2022-12-22 20:25:15] <zantomun> forged is good with the weapon that draws if it kills a minion
[2022-12-22 20:25:19] <Harps__> I thought manathirst was if you've spent that much mana while the card was in your hand, the real effect is way lamer
