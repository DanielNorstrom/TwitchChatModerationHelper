[2022-12-19 05:39:34] <%brettsalapa> @Ezzlin So you're saying that when you bonk a tree that has something in it, it can have a random item?

[2022-12-19 06:55:08] <inclining> so what's your approach to this, do you check all pots and then start on trees?

[2022-12-19 06:56:01] <!TropicalFreeze21> so in the sotn rando the checks are just key items. in this is it all the items in the dungeon?
[2022-12-19 06:56:07] <!%$Murnco> i assume pull trees don't count?

[2022-12-19 06:58:57] <%Ezzlin> Yeah in ALTTPR there's generally no concept of key items, although there is a Major Location Restriction setting in Item Sorting if you want something like that

[2022-12-19 07:13:21] <!%TropicalFreeze21> its obtuse and hard
[2022-12-19 07:13:26] <%brettsalapa> It's okay, Saku. Zelda 2 takes quite a bit of work to get the full hang off.
[2022-12-19 07:13:30] <%+Yunoe_Kitkin> Zelda 2 has a Good ENhanced Version for PC. Was Pretty fun to play after years with some good extras
[2022-12-19 07:13:30] <%+FF3LockeZ> I mean, it's a pretty bad game.
[2022-12-19 07:13:42] <&!%Jack__Mango> what a diplomatic answer
[2022-12-19 07:13:44] <!%$cybertyche> Z2 will always have a special place to me. My aunt used to work retail at KMart, and she managed to get me a copy the day before it officially released. I miss my aunt, she passed from cancer almost 30 years ago.

[2022-12-19 07:14:25] <@%Smashface_Games> It's hard because of games back then being designed for the arcade
[2022-12-19 07:14:28] <%+FF3LockeZ> It was considered the worst official Zelda game by far for a very long time, although these days they've made a couple other clunkers

[2022-12-19 08:16:22] <@%Skarthe> I think the only teacher I had that I have a grudge against was a band teacher I had in elementary and middle school, who taught us the wrong way to maintain our trumpets

[2022-12-19 08:19:10] <@%Skarthe> I started on trumpet because it was the only instrument my school offered at the time, but it still turned out to be a good fit
[2022-12-19 08:19:23] <%+Hyperstryke> And because of my how my left hand is, I can't play it anymore.

[2022-12-19 08:21:20] <!%Jack_Carsons_Rail_Videos> soooo... should i have pizza or fries? (can't have both)
[2022-12-19 08:21:28] <%+Hyperstryke> Let me put it this way: When your school is one that values inclusion, being the only one skipped over in the class for *no reason* kinda makes you upset.

[2022-12-19 08:37:03] <!%$cybertyche> I'm not sure how silverless is not a glitch, but item dash is a glitch - they both seem like unintended behavior
[2022-12-19 08:37:19] <%+FF3LockeZ> I mean, the game explicitly tells you that you can't win without the silver arrows, so I think that's a very solid indication that you're not supposed to be able to win without silver arrows
[2022-12-19 08:37:20] <PizzaHi5> no orange blade yet
[2022-12-19 08:37:32] <!%$cybertyche> But silverless ganon was intended?
[2022-12-19 08:37:32] <!%$Murnco> It was also patched out by Nintendo
[2022-12-19 08:37:46] <%+FF3LockeZ> Item dashing was actually patched out, not sure about silverless
[2022-12-19 08:37:51] <@%$EsponMyst> That's why I think it's a glitch.  I don't think Nintendo intended for you to kill him without silvers.  The fact that he has a single frame of vulnerability means it's a programming oversight
[2022-12-19 08:37:53] <@%+madelsberger> I can see where there's room for interpretation about silverless, but I suspect it is a glitch
[2022-12-19 08:37:56] VIEWERS: 206
[2022-12-19 08:38:04] <!%$Murnco> I was speaking of item dashing
[2022-12-19 08:38:36] <%brettsalapa> Bottle get. Blue Potion included.
[2022-12-19 08:38:52] <@%+madelsberger> It's very believeable that a narrow window to deal damage could be unintentionally opened due to the order the code modifies ganon's state, and that would be a glitch
[2022-12-19 08:38:54] <!%$cybertyche> Isn't that the same with fake flippers? A small window where something isn't checked when it should be?
[2022-12-19 08:39:17] <@%Keypaladin> I place Silverless as exploit, rather than glitch. Silverless acts within the rules.
[2022-12-19 08:39:23] <%Ezzlin> According to TCRF, silverless Ganon was made basically impossible after JP 1.1.
[2022-12-19 08:39:24] <%Ezzlin> It is possible to beat Ganon without the Silver Arrows, simply by slashing him while he's warping away. While this is still possible in later versions, the input window to deal damage to Ganon in this way was reduced to two frames, making this practically impossible outside of tool-assisted speedruns.
[2022-12-19 08:39:48] <!%$Murnco> It's clearly not the intentional way to kill Ganon.
[2022-12-19 08:39:56] VIEWERS: 206
[2022-12-19 08:40:04] <%Ezzlin> Yeah that's after JP version 1.1, so it was patched out
[2022-12-19 08:40:05] <!%$cybertyche> I dunno, it feels really unintentional behavior, but all of it is splitting hairs
[2022-12-19 08:40:22] <%+FF3LockeZ> ...How is that not intended
[2022-12-19 08:40:24] <@%$EsponMyst> Like if you played the original game, the story tells you that you need Silver Arrows to defeat Ganon
[2022-12-19 08:40:25] <adamgossett> look at you amazing humans :)
[2022-12-19 08:40:26] <!%$Murnco> I think hammer on helmasaur is intentional

[2022-12-19 08:40:30] <@%+madelsberger> what makes you think hammer wasn't intended on helma?

[2022-12-19 08:42:28] <%+FF3LockeZ> I will say that silverless is not listed under minor glitches on alttp-wiki, for whatever that's worth, though
[2022-12-19 08:42:30] <%+Hyperstryke> Helmasaur's Mask being immune to the hammer goes against the item placement convention.
[2022-12-19 08:42:42] <%brettsalapa> Hello @shinigami_110 and friends.
[2022-12-19 08:42:54] <@%Skarthe> Also, for purposes of rando we generally can't treat silverless under the "no glitches" card, since rando logic assumes silverless as a valid way to kill Ganon in logic unless told otherwise
[2022-12-19 08:42:57] <shinigami_110> hi hi Saku. glhf!
[2022-12-19 08:43:25] <%Ezzlin> Silverless is not in logic in the default settings of ALTTPR
[2022-12-19 08:43:26] <%+Hyperstryke> I'd like to read that.
[2022-12-19 08:43:35] <%+FF3LockeZ> @Hyperstryke You're thinking in terms of later zelda games. In Link to the Past, there's only two other bosses in the game that are vulnerable to the item in its own dungeon.
[2022-12-19 08:43:36] <@%$EsponMyst> Only in hard logic
[2022-12-19 08:43:51] <%Ezzlin> You would have to turn on beatable or a hard item pool to have it in logic

[2022-12-19 08:44:25] <@%$EsponMyst> The game will always ensure you can get Silvers, just like you'll always find the Lamp to navigate dark rooms
[2022-12-19 08:44:31] <%+FF3LockeZ> In terms of randomizer logic that makes sense, it can be required without "glitched logic" turned on

[2022-12-19 08:49:14] <@%Skarthe> My understanding of default logic (which isn't impeccable, I mainly know ALTTPR from watching streams) is that default rando logic always lets you find Silvers because it guarantees access to literally all items, but it does not logically gate any checks behind Silvers.
[2022-12-19 08:49:27] <@%+TheFogz> almost sounded like Owen Wilson waow

[2022-12-19 08:56:17] <@%+TheFogz> saku is correct a lot. it's not right I tell you
[2022-12-19 08:56:30] <%+Hyperstryke> It was discussed earlier, but the convention in later Zeldas is that the item you find is the key to beating the boss.
[2022-12-19 08:56:49] <DHStom> or reaching the boss
[2022-12-19 08:56:55] <%+Hyperstryke> Provided it's a weapon.
[2022-12-19 08:56:57] <%Ezzlin> We can't ban Saku silverless with the glitch card because the game would be unbeatable if she was playing beatable or hard item pool

[2022-12-19 09:12:15] <%+FF3LockeZ> I thought they changed that so it only used 1HKO logic if you had 1HKO actually turned on
[2022-12-19 09:13:00] <%Ezzlin> Info from Aerinon on the Discord: Okay, the useful/vital system is like this: Fetch Quest items (Shovel, Mushroom, Powder), Shields, Armor, Boomerangs, Bottles, Net, Byrna, Cape, Half Magic, and Ether and Quake are "useful" items. Every other Y/A item plus swords and keys are considered "vital". Ether and Quake can be promoted to "vital" if they open up a dungeon. I intend to promote fetch quest items if needed, but I haven't built that logic yet.

[2022-12-19 09:46:22] <%+Hyperstryke> That is definitely a hot take.
[2022-12-19 09:46:34] <@%+TheFogz> 🚌
[2022-12-19 09:47:03] <%brettsalapa> The OOT/MM Crossover rando looks really impressive.
[2022-12-19 09:47:21] <@%+KanmuriDaYo> That's quite the challenge, given how so many events are time-sensitive.
[2022-12-19 09:47:26] <%Ezzlin> MM without the clock... well the moon would never do anything, would it?
[2022-12-19 09:47:28] <%+Hyperstryke> Unfortunately, the timer in MM is a core concept of the game.
[2022-12-19 09:47:47] <%AeroRaiser> I think the reason it hasnt been is the fact that a large number of checks are locked to a specific time
[2022-12-19 09:47:57] VIEWERS: 288
[2022-12-19 09:47:58] <%CodeAndData> Yeah mm time limit is anxiety inducing for me
[2022-12-19 09:48:04] <%Ezzlin> But you can reset time, right?
[2022-12-19 09:48:20] <%brettsalapa> I was really impressed at how well the OOT/MM crossover rando looked and played. Once they fix all the bugs and add settings, it's going to be a HUGE deal.

[2022-12-19 10:01:10] <!%$Murnco> Except for those damn spinning cubes in inazuma... those are basically spin randomly for me until it's done.

[2022-12-19 10:02:25] <Rashkavar> it's kinda insulting a lot of the time too
[2022-12-19 10:02:31] <%+Hyperstryke> Not to mention patronizing.
[2022-12-19 10:02:41] <Rashkavar> because a lot of the puzzles in games that do that are already really simple puzzles
[2022-12-19 10:02:51] <!%$Murnco> If it's the littrle first puzzle in the game in the first 10 mins.. then fine give me a hint after 5 mins.... but then never do it again (or at least let me turn it off)
[2022-12-19 10:03:27] <!%Jack_Carsons_Rail_Videos> @Hyperstryke i ... H8 it when games do that sakuRIP

[2022-12-19 10:07:05] <Rashkavar> I've never consciously noticed that, but I tend to be the type to to not realize a game is leading me to things with visual prompts
[2022-12-19 10:07:57] VIEWERS: 273
[2022-12-19 10:08:10] <Rashkavar> like I didn't realize the yellow paint in deus ex human revolution was telling me where to go until I did a playthrough with the dev commentary
[2022-12-19 10:08:18] <!%Jack_Carsons_Rail_Videos> attention to detail goes a long way
[2022-12-19 10:08:47] <Rashkavar> I just would look at the yellow paint and say "that looks like progression, I'm going elsewhere" and had no idea why
[2022-12-19 10:09:57] VIEWERS: 273
[2022-12-19 10:10:33] <Rashkavar> In a game that had so much yellow paint to mark progression that some level designers started putting rows and rows of yellow paint cans in storage areas as a joke
