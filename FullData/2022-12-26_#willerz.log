[2022-12-26 18:54:50] <nevloch1> I was watching a popular streamer yesterday and noticed  they look right to read chat foward to play but eyes kept slipping left  and he would know where they were coming from...
[2022-12-26 18:54:51] <without_a_dad> There are always cheesers... but there are also people playing like they don't normally play and it's full of sweats... and you can't listen to chat... you could kill yourself with a grenade and chat will say a cheeser used the force and moved the nade on you

[2022-12-26 19:12:37] <+ManiaKal> I think Killa is the hardest boss for sure. Dude hunts you down and sprays you into the next raid
[2022-12-26 19:12:37] <TheRealJemima> @TheIRock02 10 mins
[2022-12-26 19:12:39] <@%+LilPoopGod> @dfields1515 probably killa because of his spawns and armor
[2022-12-26 19:12:42] <+obiwanlegacy> I literally get no satisfaction from killing an AI boss, would rather kill a lvl 15 Timmy

[2022-12-26 19:15:34] <%keaton_m1a> @WillerZ From Wiki -- song origins = Prince got the idea for the song when he dozed off in band member Lisa Coleman's 1964 pink Mercury Montclair Marauder after an exhausting all-night recording session. The lyrics came to him in bits and pieces during this and other catnaps. Eventually, he was able to finish it without sleeping.

[2022-12-26 20:03:48] <wickeddb> I have zero issues with ads on your stream man. I love that I know I'm gonna get ads, but I know on your stream there not gonna be at the same time as peak gameplay because you are kind enough to run them before and after good gameplay.

[2022-12-26 20:19:09] <%+SuperNuts> @WillerZ latency has to do with what server you're pinging, so even if it has low ping (17ms is low), that's only for that one particular server.

[2022-12-26 20:21:30] <%+SuperNuts> @WillerZ 17ms means absolutely nothing. ofc you're going to have low latency using comcast as your ISP and pinging comcast servers. your ping comes into play for each individual server because your traffic will be routed outside of comcast.

[2022-12-26 20:26:33] <Devgrusome> I'm also a Network Architect. Radio Frequency isn't at play here. Fiber is light levels via transceiver mediums. You comcast router will transmit your data via light to Comcast's nearest POP (point of presence). *usually* random packet loss is what we call a layer 1 issue in the ISP world which is just the physical pathway of your data pathway.
[2022-12-26 20:26:34] <%+SuperNuts> @WillerZ remove the splitter to test. if it works, then replace the splitter with a high quality splitter.

[2022-12-26 20:28:26] <ayegreen> having two modems on the same line helps troubleshooting actually is the other modem having the same issues?

[2022-12-26 20:37:54] <+CTRL_ALT_DEEZ> @chadgrubb   the coax usually comes into houses at ground level and ends with a connector shortly inside the house, hence a splitter is needed there.  Nobody would put a modem in the basement there.

[2022-12-26 20:40:38] <%WISDUM> IMO the packet loss is likely not related to the coax infrastructure. is probably do to node traffic and congestion on the specific card in the CMTS. Comcast is pretty notorious for oversubscription which gives you all sorts of issues during peak usage.
[2022-12-26 20:40:39] <+lazoran23> @without_a_dad anyone that runs a business that uses internet usually keeps two ISPs and his family can use the other one as their primary
[2022-12-26 20:40:42] <crimzzrot1> servers down?
[2022-12-26 20:40:43] <Devgrusome> @chadgrubb It's just the quickest and easiest way Comcast could provide their service. Willer's house had old coax wiring in place so Comcast just added an adapter. All Willer would need to do is replace the existing Coax infrastructure with full ethernet BASE-T wiring and he could go straight to the modem.

[2022-12-26 20:48:21] <%+TheOnlyHabibi> @WillerZ srry i was playing overwatch while watching u. if you would like, we can have a chat about HFC/DOCSIS networks after ur stream, however at this point its kinda moot because u will be switching to a different ISP shortly utilizing fiber. im sure the techs know whats going on and why its happening (not the supervisors who typically only know the basics of a HFC network). Ur welcome to call me on discord later if you want a deep dive into either HFC or fiber networks.

[2022-12-26 22:00:56] <Thuum> scope glint ruins sniping in games
[2022-12-26 22:00:56] <%+ZWOGs> @WillerZ Is there a keybind to drop your gun without going into inventory?
[2022-12-26 22:00:57] <Pikkuuu> hell no
[2022-12-26 22:00:58] <%+fullerc130> nope
[2022-12-26 22:00:59] <AlienNamedDave> Even w wipe I dunno how @willerz resists just looting everything
[2022-12-26 22:01:03] <%T_RAN> when is wipe mod man sir @2L33Zy Kappa
[2022-12-26 22:01:03] <+marnszyy> @spamilator LUL
[2022-12-26 22:01:06] <+MunkE8> from a flashlight sure just by aiming no
[2022-12-26 22:01:07] <D1lluH> @Chrischros1 That is very much true :D
[2022-12-26 22:01:10] <Its_chasebo> glint only happens at certain angles, i hate cod has that shit
[2022-12-26 22:01:17] <+corpb> lmfao

[2022-12-26 22:01:28] <+ManiaKal> I cant stand that glint shit cod and bf do
[2022-12-26 22:01:32] <+Qarbon_> How do you play songs from artists and not get in trouble or DMCA‚Äôd? Not complaining, you‚Äôre playing some BOPS just curious!
[2022-12-26 22:01:33] <%MikeWilliams1990> glint is stupid, unless youre looking into the sun
[2022-12-26 22:01:35] <Abel_Jo> make looking into windows not as dark
[2022-12-26 22:01:44] <%+callmethicthighs> @WillerZ Hows baby glu
[2022-12-26 22:01:48] <+MunkE8> @MikeWilliams1990 so a flashlight
[2022-12-26 22:01:55] <ddraggbagg> glint is extremely unlikely in real life cases. Honestly is way more common with using lights at night than it is from the sun during the day
[2022-12-26 22:01:58] <+AngryJello> cant you see what the scav been doing to meee
[2022-12-26 22:01:58] <%smoke802x> @spamilator each grip and how you build the gun affects how you carry it and how it moves i dont have to prove anything because its a known thing
[2022-12-26 22:02:03] <%+ZWOGs> @WillerZ Is there a keybind to drop your gun without going into inventory?

[2022-12-26 22:02:28] <AlienNamedDave> Have they fixed the IR lasers to show in night vision?
[2022-12-26 22:02:30] <+spamilator> @smoke802x the higher the ergo the less sway going ADs. Unlike you I can prove that
[2022-12-26 22:02:37] <%MikeWilliams1990> @MunkE8 if youre in close proximity but thats all it would resemble if someone shined a flashlight at you indoors, be like youre flashlighting them back basically
[2022-12-26 22:04:03] <%+matthorndrums> @Qarbon_ you can split audio onto a seperate track so  it doesnt end up in the vod.
[2022-12-26 22:04:04] <boorahh> any word if there is going to be drops after wipe?
[2022-12-26 22:04:07] <USEC> KKona GuitarTime
[2022-12-26 22:04:08] <%smoke802x> @spamilator its not all about stats my dude
[2022-12-26 22:04:08] <%$Apotheosis47> @boorahh i believe theyve been confirmed to start on the 29th
[2022-12-26 22:04:09] <Its_chasebo> @AlienNamedDave they added it awhile ago
[2022-12-26 22:04:10] <@%^Nightbot> Check out the youtube channel! https://www.youtube.com/@WILLERZ4
[2022-12-26 22:04:10] <%+Topic_TW> @Qarbon_ twitch has a vod track that you just send everything except music to. that way music isn't in clips or vods. that's what generally gets DMCA'd
[2022-12-26 22:04:10] <boorahh> @boorahh good deal thank you
[2022-12-26 22:04:12] <AlienNamedDave> Twitch should allow multiple audio streams for creators. So I can listen to @willerz talk without hearing his game while I play
[2022-12-26 22:04:13] <+alongwell> didnt the last time wipe happened with drops the servers started on fire?
[2022-12-26 22:04:13] <%+Topic_TW> I don't like glint but the reflections that you see before you ADS looked sick in MW2. Loved the way the Hamr sight looks in MW2
[2022-12-26 22:04:13] <+MunkE8> @MunkE8 yeah
[2022-12-26 22:04:14] <schwabbyy> this song reminds of the sandlot opening damn

[2022-12-26 22:04:15] <sapientserpent> And on top of that... Military RECON teams use glint covers. Always have the sun to their back if they can. I was no RECON guy when I was in the ARMY, but it is common sense. COD blew that out of proportion.
