[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <@%Yruhatin> honestly. this game is probably my GOTY. but I would never enjoy playing it, but I can see that it's a great frickin game
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <Andys_Are_Ace> i own the game even if i cant play it well lol
[2022-12-07 18:00:26] <%rmach1ne> !run
[2022-12-07 18:00:27] <@%^y0shi_b0t> Mikkaa is playing Elden Ring on a Dance Pad as a controller! She only uses M&K for menus.
[2022-12-07 18:00:38] <%kingofkyrat697> @oyk697 really, where? LUL
[2022-12-07 18:00:40] <wyldestryder> it's an OK game
[2022-12-07 18:00:41] <@%K3nzz0> It is the best game for 2022 yesh
[2022-12-07 18:00:43] <@%Yruhatin> tomorrow I think
[2022-12-07 18:00:45] <%a__girl_has_no_name> Tomorrow!
[2022-12-07 18:00:46] <NightmareStealer92> tomorrow right?
[2022-12-07 18:00:51] <%+grymzol> Game of the year was Trombone Champion.
[2022-12-07 18:00:54] <+NitramYaj> Game Awards are tomorrow
[2022-12-07 18:00:56] <%yusha74> oooh tomorrow
[2022-12-07 18:00:59] <+Nagashi> Game of the Year is definitely Diablo Immortals.
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <%Alasdair> too bad it's past your bedtime
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <%CombatNeenja> elden ring will win
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <psyi0nick> Elden Ring for sure
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%xcrat03> ELDEN
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <deathfurr> legend of zelda like every year
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%a__girl_has_no_name> Elden Ring by a mile
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%+VorticZombies> Elden Ring has to win tbh
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <+SirThicccness> Elden Ring or GoWR
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <kotajari9> trolol
[2022-12-07 18:01:11] <NightmareStealer92> has to be ER
[2022-12-07 18:01:13] <twistedtheory69> Elden ring game of the year
[2022-12-07 18:01:13] <+Archmander> ER should win
[2022-12-07 18:01:13] <%onyeah_> I think stray is best indy game of the year
[2022-12-07 18:01:15] <+SirThicccness> Ive played both
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <+oneiros421> This or GOW2
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <oyk697> @kingofkyrat697 The sound that said  Kos or some say kosm grant us eyes
[2022-12-07 18:01:19] <@%K3nzz0> Game awards is December 9, 2022 at 1:30 AM GMT+1
[2022-12-07 18:01:19] <@%Yruhatin> probably this game. GoWR is the only other game that stands a chance
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <@%Radolov> It's nearby
[2022-12-07 18:01:22] <+SirThicccness> they are fucking amazing
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%yusha74> Far Cry 6 already has GOTY edition coming up mikkaaKEKW mikkaaKEKW
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%spillendabeans> @grymzol ty for the smorgas
[2022-12-07 18:01:28] <+NitramYaj> God of War will likely win I think in most categories. Elden Ring will get a nod win in another category I think.
[2022-12-07 18:01:29] <%CombatNeenja> I voted for GoW so i know for sure that elden ring will win :P
[2022-12-07 18:01:30] <DroskiezZ> Elden ring wining forsure
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <itzbrendoo> bonfire in caelid
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <!%bmap72> i thinks theres one back a little
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <@%Radolov> It's nearby
[2022-12-07 18:01:37] <@%Radolov> Just down there
[2022-12-07 18:01:38] <%gkingx88> RTH has some
[2022-12-07 18:01:45] <!%bmap72> if you head south
[2022-12-07 18:01:46] <!%bmap72> right?
[2022-12-07 18:01:49] <!%bmap72> yeah
[2022-12-07 18:01:50] <%Alasdair> i personally think ragnarok is a better video game, but i see the appeal of both
[2022-12-07 18:01:51] <%+kingcold59> That one requires two stonesword keys if I'm not mistaken.
[2022-12-07 18:01:57] <arch_safild> Tekken 8 announce tomorrow mikkaaCool
[2022-12-07 18:01:58] <itzbrendoo> as soon as you go up there's one too haha
[2022-12-07 18:01:59] <%Thydus_76> GOW R is a solid 9 but its not a 10, ER did alot more for the souls series then what ragnarok did for GOW
[2022-12-07 18:02:00] <!%bmap72> that would have been bad
[2022-12-07 18:02:06] <%triffidgreen> ya it should be in January i agree
[2022-12-07 18:02:16] <%+grymzol> I can't see GoW winning. It's story was too much all over the place. Still great, but not as good as 2018.
[2022-12-07 18:02:19] <@%Yruhatin> @Thydus_76 that's my exact reasoning
[2022-12-07 18:02:22] <%ihavenoidea567> mikkaaKEKW
[2022-12-07 18:02:27] <%Alasdair> you are the worst
[2022-12-07 18:02:32] <%OCaptainMyCapitan> Of the six nominations for Game of the Year I havent played any of them and not heard about four of them! FeelsWeirdMan
[2022-12-07 18:02:32] <%Const__tine> gm, how's going @MissMikkaa mikkaaCosy
[2022-12-07 18:02:35] <PeytonManThing> Should be November before Black Friday
[2022-12-07 18:02:39] <%+Divinal> It needs to be before christmas for extra games industry sales
[2022-12-07 18:02:50] <%HarmonicArcade> I voted Ragnarok for lots of categories but Elden Ring was goty for me
[2022-12-07 18:02:54] <%yusha74> What game you think wins Mikka ?
[2022-12-07 18:03:01] <%OCaptainMyCapitan> yes
[2022-12-07 18:03:03] <oyk697> Elden ring dropping this update before goty votes is insane
[2022-12-07 18:03:03] <!%bmap72> @OCaptainMyCapitan live under a rock? haha

[2022-12-07 18:03:08] <%+grymzol> What the hell is an Elden Ring? mikkaaKEKW
[2022-12-07 18:03:09] <+NitramYaj> I think GoW is a better game from a narrative perspective and probably got a lot more people to play it. Also the game industry being parent age right at this time helps lol
[2022-12-07 18:03:10] <%Alasdair> at least ragnarok has a story that doesn't involve forensic online investigation
[2022-12-07 18:03:10] <+EkkosUwU> @Alasdair Eh, less customization, skillt rees are TERRIBLE, story had the shittiest ending it couldve had and did absolutely nothing to build on what it had already done, but the combat was better this time around same with enemy variety but the levels were so boring
[2022-12-07 18:03:12] <DroskiezZ> I feel like ragnorok was too short of a story
[2022-12-07 18:03:13] <+Nagashi> Diablo Immortals going to win.
[2022-12-07 18:03:16] <@%K3nzz0> I voted Overwatch 2 for GOTY

[2022-12-07 18:03:54] <+EkkosUwU> @KratosAresBoss I actually found the atreus parts to be the most fun just because he had more life to his combat, The swamp with him was annoying af though

[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <Andys_Are_Ace> ive just seen the list, Stray has to win 1000%
[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <+Archmander> GOW is a well crafted game, but Zero innovative on what it does. ER added so much new things to open world games that deserves GoTY
[2022-12-07 18:04:26] <%RegentOfOrigin> there'll be peace when you are done
[2022-12-07 18:04:27] <@%K3nzz0> @Archmander absolutely this
[2022-12-07 18:04:27] <DroskiezZ> @yusha74 you think? Even tho it’s a PS exclusive?

[2022-12-07 18:04:37] <%OCaptainMyCapitan> @MissMikkaa I haven't heard of these --> A Plague Tale: Requiem, Horizon Forbidden West, Stray and Xenoblade Chronicles 3
[2022-12-07 18:04:38] <%HarmonicArcade> @k3nzz0 I tried to start season 2 today and was like… I’m not feeling it anymore
[2022-12-07 18:04:39] <giganticcameltoe69> they will make a stand alone for atreus
[2022-12-07 18:04:39] <Antone1994> My only problem with Elden Ring is the lack of unique bosses. 90% of the bosses are just normal enemies with big health bars. Which sucks because boss fights are my favorite part of souls games.
[2022-12-07 18:04:39] <%+terranpatrol88> How's the colosseum dlc?
[2022-12-07 18:04:40] <%RegentOfOrigin> dun dun duh dun
[2022-12-07 18:04:42] <%gkingx88> the really important thing about the game awards tomorrow is whether they will announce ER dlc

[2022-12-07 18:05:03] <%brianthebroken85> I did a few duels just now. Won 3 and lost 1...and the guy who beat me just wiped the floor with me...and kept teabagging me each time he won., lol.
[2022-12-07 18:05:07] <%yusha74> @droskiezz I‘d imagine it attracts a broader spectrum
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <michalno555> dont think you do
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <KratosAresBoss> @KratosAresBoss His dialougue was awkward like yeah hes a young kid and should be a little gangly but it wasnt natural i feel like they under wrote him
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <%RegentOfOrigin> @im_bagels THE ROAD SO FAR SHWAAA
[2022-12-07 18:05:17] <%Alasdair> you know i understand why you like the extreme simplicity and relatively skill-less approach to Elden Ring's combat, where each player just has attack and dodge, but the tiny world and zero s ide content make me think that the superior game of the year is most likely going to be The Devil In Me because it has vsatly better combat than whatever Fromsoft put out, there's nothing more skillful than QTEs
[2022-12-07 18:05:19] <!%bmap72> yeah bleed build

[2022-12-07 18:05:33] <haidere36> Sekiro didn't have an easy mode and won in 2019
[2022-12-07 18:05:46] <@%K3nzz0> @HarmonicArcade 100% get you, very little reward for sure
[2022-12-07 18:05:49] <%TitaniumXplatinum> Should be able to walk around the jar I thinks mikkaaMlem
[2022-12-07 18:05:53] <+NitramYaj> GoW also has the discovery approach to things much like Elden Ring so I think that is gonna take a lot of the wind out of the pro Elden Ring argument I think
