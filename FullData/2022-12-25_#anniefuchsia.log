[2022-12-25 00:49:27] <%PanicRush> and if you are hungry it can be a candy
[2022-12-25 00:49:27] <%Leysfort> could be a soap bomb
[2022-12-25 00:49:28] <%+Alastor7783> should be a perfume + hand cream + 3 soaps

[2022-12-25 19:09:41] <%Twigbot4k> My only question for stuff like this.. is do we really need to tie it to fishing?  Of ALL things you could tie it to.. Blizz picks.. fishing?  Fishing?  Seriously, fishing?
[2022-12-25 19:09:44] <FinnMacCool_IRL> it is - you go back there later in solution
[2022-12-25 19:09:56] <Meshootskeet> So I last played this game 7th of May this year and now thinking of coming back just because I heard that Blizzard increased the drop rate of Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. This true?

[2022-12-25 19:53:03] <%Tenivir> yeah the problem is that people would min max it and make best tier stuff then swap their points to next thing etc

[2022-12-25 19:53:06] <Kakan_94> not being able to respec makes it pretty much mandatory to check guides to not waste points

[2022-12-25 19:55:26] <italoderhengst> WhySoSerious
[2022-12-25 19:55:33] <killersam1212> i think making bolts only makes sense if you have good mullticraft i guess
[2022-12-25 19:55:47] <%+Zaikh> @bennet_r buying dragonflight and having a sub also so gives you access to play classic for free. only buy classic pass if you want boost or other perks.

[2022-12-25 20:59:38] <%Makkan780> best way to make gold is havign gold nad playing the AH
[2022-12-25 20:59:42] <%imaqttpiegg> just go and mine everywhere
[2022-12-25 20:59:49] <jonnyh1994> mining has been great for me
[2022-12-25 20:59:53] <jonnyh1994> herb not so mucxh atm
[2022-12-25 21:00:13] <%imaqttpiegg> easy 50-60k in 1 hour mining even more maybe
[2022-12-25 21:00:16] <redmyst_> I make around 100k in an hour with mining and herb together
[2022-12-25 21:00:20] <+Flints_> i mine and herb while in BG queues, feels legit
[2022-12-25 21:00:21] <jonnyh1994> like 2k which isn't a lot too many people but it's as much as I have done lol
[2022-12-25 21:00:23] <%whizakaz> Oh shit you reached 40k Pog
[2022-12-25 21:00:24] <vodoomon> in eonar i make around 50-70k gold in an hour just with mining
[2022-12-25 21:00:29] <%PanicRush> @AnnieFuchsia hunts in azure span, unlucky

[2022-12-25 21:00:46] <FluffyFloofer> cloth and enchanting farm are great gold
[2022-12-25 21:00:47] <%Taylor131313> 2k is notthing
[2022-12-25 21:00:56] <%Mirkooo> So the range is 2k-100k an hour for mining KEKW
[2022-12-25 21:00:59] <%imaqttpiegg> 2k gold per hour as mining / herb?
[2022-12-25 21:01:01] <jonnyh1994> I mean I am queueing bgs lol
[2022-12-25 21:01:02] <vodoomon> @jonnyh1994 mining non stop for an hour, listen to music and some netflix shows
[2022-12-25 21:01:11] <%Lorrdzik> true, 2k is nothing, I did more with afk boost LUL
[2022-12-25 21:01:15] <redmyst_> @jonnyh1994 Flying around mining + herbing in Waking shores and using overload on titans is around 100k an hour, sometimes a bit less, sometimes more

[2022-12-25 21:02:22] <vodoomon> in NA is 160k so i can make a sub in 2 hours prob
[2022-12-25 21:02:23] <%Makkan780> wow token is 250k
[2022-12-25 21:02:24] <jonnyh1994> I fly around blindly lol
[2022-12-25 21:02:28] <%PanicRush> 5 hours for 30 days of play time is good
[2022-12-25 21:02:35] <%Mirkooo> Working at McDonalds is around 300k gold per hour, also pretty good farming spot
[2022-12-25 21:02:36] <redmyst_> A nice lazy way to make gold is to just fly around tyrs hold for the titan respawns there, get the nodes, log off, come back later
[2022-12-25 21:02:37] <%TheKingOfWit> damn it's only 150k on NA :(
[2022-12-25 21:02:41] <lightweight1> happy holidays

[2022-12-25 21:02:44] <redmyst_> easy to do inbetween queues too
[2022-12-25 21:02:44] <Brues1> yeah herb/mine nodes are so plentiful that I just fly around randomly and constantly hit spots lol
[2022-12-25 21:03:04] <FluffyFloofer> with the proper tailor and enchat spec you can make insane gold doing cloth famrs
[2022-12-25 21:03:13] <%Boreall> Idk why NA WoW token is down so much, end of SL it was ~220k
[2022-12-25 21:03:16] <+Flints_> also its' such a nice vibe gathering in DF with mounted gathering

[2022-12-25 21:03:50] <%Ammbrus> i just used sky golem
[2022-12-25 21:03:55] <%Makkan780> @Boreall it always go down early expansions
[2022-12-25 21:03:55] <unholyhoit> until you find a node up in a tree KEKW
[2022-12-25 21:03:55] <redmyst_> You can make* woops

[2022-12-25 21:03:55] <jonnyh1994> Dragonriding has killed off so many bots. For now at least :D
[2022-12-25 21:03:56] <+rekhes> and leveling is really good gold too
[2022-12-25 21:04:03] <%ElWrayx> You could use the mount too
[2022-12-25 21:04:08] <%Collnaris> i'm not bias though
[2022-12-25 21:04:09] <%+minitehnikus> what specializations for mining ?
[2022-12-25 21:04:17] <FluffyFloofer> yes
[2022-12-25 21:04:18] <HollowCheese> Crusader aura works with dragonriding?
[2022-12-25 21:04:19] <unholyhoit> they need at least one human
[2022-12-25 21:04:20] <%PanicRush> start of an expansion/new patch is great for gold making, i made almost 400k just selling signets for wrathion rep in a couple of days of lazy playing
[2022-12-25 21:04:23] <%AHSeanR> that is hilarious
[2022-12-25 21:04:23] <Metalcalfe> Does dragonriding actually get boosted with crusader aura?
[2022-12-25 21:04:29] <%Ammbrus> probably can eventually get it figured out
[2022-12-25 21:04:30] <%+natebc> the herbs stun them and stuff too
[2022-12-25 21:04:30] <+Raziers> @AnnieFuchsia yes. Bots usually move via coordinates in 2d space. they struggle with flying alot
[2022-12-25 21:04:39] <redmyst_> Bots teleport around, because the movement speed thing isn't working as intended since DF flying is so fast
[2022-12-25 21:04:40] <+marblesz> whoa never thought of that LOL get rid of the bots
[2022-12-25 21:04:40] <vodoomon> at the start of the xpac i made around 1.2m gold with mining and herb
[2022-12-25 21:04:48] <%Collnaris> just mak flying hard LULE
[2022-12-25 21:04:51] <vodoomon> the first 2 weeks were glorious
[2022-12-25 21:05:11] <%PanicRush> start of an expansion/new patch is great for gold making, i made almost 400k just selling signets for wrathion rep in a couple of days of lazy playing @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-25 21:05:14] <%+KanmarDE> @Metalcalfe no, afaik not
[2022-12-25 21:05:19] <%+Raspatt> 50-100k an hour seems legit
[2022-12-25 21:05:20] <jonnyh1994> Yeah, I'm losing so much money with alch. I'm just focusing on gatheriong atm
[2022-12-25 21:05:21] <%Collnaris> aktually according to my statistics :nerdg
[2022-12-25 21:05:21] <%Ammbrus> the 3 star makes it much more lucrative and fun too
[2022-12-25 21:05:30] <%Collnaris> peepoNerd
[2022-12-25 21:05:31] <Aagge> I mean, not only put it in the whole game, you would need to force it as the only way to fly in the entire game if you want to prevent bots using that method, which would render all flying mounts obsolete @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-25 21:05:35] <%PanicRush> people who were nolifing key farm definitely made a lot more

[2022-12-25 21:05:54] <margomilo> made ~50k herbing with friends for maybe separate 3 hours, so maybe mining is more lucrative

[2022-12-25 21:06:12] <jonnyh1994> tbf, you only need to make it hard for bots fo the most current content because that's generally where profits are made so bots only make sense there

[2022-12-25 23:19:26] <%BrendanK> @decrode what you up to
[2022-12-25 23:19:46] <cantfindcat> Turtle is huntesr most important ability, survival of the fittest. Those 2 are pretty much the only defensive. Except for pvp talent that gives your feign death a shield for like 3 sec
[2022-12-25 23:20:04] <%nufardetvaranog> best way to get honor is to queue for both epic and random bg. That way which ever pops first, you can enter. Then you are still in queue for the other. And when you get out, you have instant queue for next. Queue again for the other before accepting queue. Rinse and repeat, no more waiting. @anniefuchsia

[2022-12-25 23:23:48] <%nufardetvaranog> depends on weather you queued in a winning streak or not :) you get about 500 to 1000 honor per bg. Gear is from 525 i think up to 1600 ish honor per piece. @rover_45
