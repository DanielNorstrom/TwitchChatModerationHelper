[2022-12-25 20:04:09] <%+LBoogs_> Xanax and klonopin are just so strong, and make me personally just want to sleep, it also makes you forget things, I don’t think either should be prescribed for daily regimen, more so for panic attacks
[2022-12-25 20:04:10] <%$TheAlmighty61> i feel like alcohol is worse then weed by far

[2022-12-25 20:04:57] <soltygamings> when you don't have alcohol you go through shakes throwing up it is so serious so is heroin    it bast alll a round stay in school chat

[2022-12-25 23:37:04] <+Kapill89> @svensserino he'll get banned real fast. dont worry
[2022-12-25 23:37:05] <Buxbomber> unless he is black he can say it
[2022-12-25 23:37:08] <ButSureLook> Naw i dont think he went for the hard R but doesnt matter
[2022-12-25 23:37:11] <svensserino> just a word
[2022-12-25 23:37:11] <%somerandomjabroni> Hard R or not is stupid
[2022-12-25 23:37:13] <+slyruthless> uh oh he used the gamer word?
[2022-12-25 23:37:15] <NoBakez> hope the report went through
[2022-12-25 23:37:16] <simaodocabouco> if he is black its ok to say it
[2022-12-25 23:37:21] <BreaKinGz1> Its not your fault is he say that
[2022-12-25 23:37:22] <@%TrillOG_> twitch doesnt mind the non hard r
[2022-12-25 23:37:24] <+OG_Unphased> kai cennat says it all the time on stream
[2022-12-25 23:37:29] <@%TrillOG_> if you are allowed to
[2022-12-25 23:37:30] <+OG_Unphased> its fine if youre black
[2022-12-25 23:37:30] <+Kapill89> @simaodocabouco no its not.
[2022-12-25 23:37:39] <!%MeowMeinStreams> @TrillOG_ that's not something to fuck with
[2022-12-25 23:37:43] <%+reckless516> they dont care about non hard r
[2022-12-25 23:37:44] <!%MeowMeinStreams> cause twitch is inconsistent as fuck
[2022-12-25 23:37:44] <%+KONIUX27v2> @Gingy he just wanted to say kitty but misspoken a bit, didnt mean no harm

[2022-12-25 23:37:52] <+tupackk> tbh if its a black person saying non hard r it can't be like bannable
[2022-12-25 23:38:02] <iguffy> what if you identify as a black person, does it count?
[2022-12-25 23:38:04] <+jambelz> did he know you were streaming?
[2022-12-25 23:38:05] <Buxbomber> ya im pretty sure he said it with an a and not er so you should be fine on stream
[2022-12-25 23:38:09] <AwareSznnn> @TrillOG_ wdym by that🤨
[2022-12-25 23:38:09] <+OG_Unphased> as a black man he sounded black to me

[2022-12-25 23:41:19] <+tupackk> honestly snipers do that shit all the time in rust. its annoying to have happen, but its literally out of the streamers control. if u did get banned, I'd imagine it'd immediately be overturned.
