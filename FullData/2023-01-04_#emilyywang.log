[2023-01-04 15:47:04] <+bisnacksual> at this point I'm just waiting for the game to be balanced before climbing again
[2023-01-04 15:47:05] <%timoren> wait wtf i felt there was more prismatics but everyone asked gaslighted me and said its just me
[2023-01-04 15:47:08] <%Dawad321> like how man Bark
[2023-01-04 15:47:10] <%SpacebicTFT> Disable prismatics in ranked ok
[2023-01-04 15:47:17] <%PokeyPandaBear> The way the % works out you would think they would want prismatic to be lower after a 2-1 prismatic but instead it's so high
[2023-01-04 15:47:17] <レオリペ (leolipe_)> which monster flavour is that?
[2023-01-04 15:47:19] <!%+nelstrider> Prismatic lobbies are cringe because they are all absolutely 1st or 8th if you hit the good ones
[2023-01-04 15:47:21] <IceCreamHobo> too many things have changed in one patch
[2023-01-04 15:47:28] <%Moe11436> there is some logic which we don't understand Keepo

[2023-01-04 15:48:17] <+Hornet_Yamata> without prismatic everygame would feel the same, but hero aug already plays the diversity role. I think it's just a couple adjustements that needs to be done
[2023-01-04 15:48:21] <%Dawad321> I think augments are really unbalanced this patch agreeGe Units are fairly balanced though

[2023-01-04 15:49:15] <!%+nelstrider> 2-1 are random
[2023-01-04 15:49:15] <+Hornet_Yamata> lol just learn to play around hero aug, and most of the time u'll get something that you like on 2/1
