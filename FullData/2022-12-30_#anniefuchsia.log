[2022-12-30 11:27:47] <%PanicRush> does the quality of the diamond matter for elemental lariat craft?

[2022-12-30 11:28:19] <%PanicRush> i mean the illimited diamond
[2022-12-30 11:28:22] <%Geoffku> mine said I could use q2
[2022-12-30 11:28:27] <%PanicRush> i wanted to place crafting order
[2022-12-30 11:28:42] <%PanicRush> if i can use q2 its great because its 2.8k gold
[2022-12-30 11:28:47] <%PanicRush> instead of 30k for q3
[2022-12-30 11:28:47] <%NoName6834> otk isn't surviving 2023 is it LUL

[2022-12-30 11:30:15] <%Taylor131313> you'll get min quality very likely
[2022-12-30 11:30:15] <%Geoffku> you'll get dogshit if it's public

[2022-12-30 11:44:33] <%Taylor131313> 418 is with mats you get from +16s and above
[2022-12-30 11:44:35] <%Geoffku> that's using the concencrated primal infusionn
[2022-12-30 11:44:40] <%Taylor131313> same as the +11s one
[2022-12-30 11:45:04] <%PanicRush> aha i see
[2022-12-30 11:45:06] <%Geoffku> basically upgrades it to mythic lvl
[2022-12-30 11:45:12] <%PanicRush> so i will need to farm those in the future and recraft?

[2022-12-30 11:46:22] <Geoffku> anniesShrug xdd
[2022-12-30 11:47:17] <%PanicRush> build a tower, fill it with chaoses and dive in it like Scrooge McDuck in his money
[2022-12-30 11:47:58] <%Taylor131313> can blizzard make it so we can buy trinkets with primal chaos
[2022-12-30 11:48:04] <%Taylor131313> absolutely not biased opinion

[2022-12-30 11:48:48] <%Geoffku> tiered medallion setting
[2022-12-30 11:48:57] <%Geoffku> you will need a q2 and a q3
[2022-12-30 11:49:27] <%PanicRush> 5500 for a q3 Pepepains
[2022-12-30 11:49:51] <%Geoffku> you'll also need to find a crafter for the primalist gem
[2022-12-30 11:50:20] <%PanicRush> va faaaaaan Pepepains
[2022-12-30 11:50:23] <%Taylor131313> what's a primalist gem
[2022-12-30 11:50:36] <%Geoffku> the big boi gem that you can only have 1 of
[2022-12-30 11:50:54] <%Taylor131313> anniesGoofy
[2022-12-30 11:50:58] <%Taylor131313> never heard of it
[2022-12-30 11:51:25] <%Geoffku> look at my first gem https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/ravencrest/geoffku
[2022-12-30 11:52:11] <%Geoffku> https://www.wowhead.com/item=192988/skillful-illimited-diamond
[2022-12-30 11:53:17] <%Geoffku> I guess you would use this one taylor https://www.wowhead.com/item=192983/fierce-illimited-diamond
[2022-12-30 11:55:59] <%PanicRush> i need inscribed illimited diamond, do i bother looking for a crafter? Pepepains
[2022-12-30 11:56:27] <%Wardrick7> if you want decent quality then yes
[2022-12-30 11:56:56] <%Wardrick7> public orders are only good if you dont care about quality
[2022-12-30 11:59:46] <%Taylor131313> maybe makkan can do them, he is specialised in gems

[2022-12-30 12:07:08] <%$Hasan_Lurker> Wokege IceCold
[2022-12-30 12:07:40] <%Wardrick7> if you go for that gem in your neck then going for q3 is better cause you wont need to change it later as recrafting keeps all your gems
[2022-12-30 12:10:23] <%PanicRush> i only have 15k gold left LUL
[2022-12-30 12:10:32] <%PanicRush> i can try 1 more craft and it will cost literally all of it
[2022-12-30 12:11:32] <%Wardrick7> then go for q2 LUL
[2022-12-30 12:11:54] <%Wardrick7> and get gathering professions to farm gold

[2022-12-30 14:08:09] <~%AnnieFuchsia> time*
[2022-12-30 14:08:28] <%Sne4ky79> Isnt fextralife or what the dudes name is which does that crap,?
[2022-12-30 14:08:31] <~%AnnieFuchsia> it hasn't been so bad for wow, mainly only method who boosts their viewers this way
[2022-12-30 14:08:43] <~%AnnieFuchsia> but overall nobody likes it, so idk why twitch allows it
[2022-12-30 14:08:51] <~%AnnieFuchsia> they're fake viewers who wont stick on the site

[2022-12-30 14:09:29] <%Hezmund> @Sne4ky79 it's a wiki org but yes they use their wiki to embed their stream
[2022-12-30 14:09:41] <%+Collnaris> probably just to portray they are big streamers on the site, so more people will get eyes on them scrolling
[2022-12-30 14:09:46] <%PanicRush> it is so annoying when you go to fextralife for some guide and it laods the strum
[2022-12-30 14:09:56] <%Sne4ky79> do they even visit those streams! and also talk in their chats?
[2022-12-30 14:10:04] <+Luscioo> it´s bec. of the money they can charge for sponsorships, bec they have an higher avg viewcount
[2022-12-30 14:10:17] <%Geoffku> no that's why fextralife's chat is nonexistent
[2022-12-30 14:10:17] <%PanicRush> some do, but people who only use the wiki ignore the stream
[2022-12-30 14:10:19] <~%AnnieFuchsia> @Luscioo yep
[2022-12-30 14:10:27] <~%AnnieFuchsia> so the people who fake their viewer numbers
[2022-12-30 14:10:33] <~%AnnieFuchsia> get more money from sponsors

[2022-12-30 14:12:08] <%Mirkooo> @Geoffku Ahh yeah!
[2022-12-30 14:12:15] <~%AnnieFuchsia> advertisers pay based on how many watch in the end
[2022-12-30 14:12:22] <~%AnnieFuchsia> thats why people like nymn got lower ad rev later

[2022-12-30 14:12:31] <+Luscioo> a company have a certain ad budget, for example the will sponsor x- amount of streamers, so if you have higher viewcount, it´s predicable to say who will get an offer or a better deal

[2022-12-30 14:55:47] <%bYTEfROG> Some schools want to foster a reputation as a "hard school" to make their degrees worth more
[2022-12-30 14:55:47] <%Wardrick7> its similar here, if you want to go in to medicine you need best scores and one shitty teacher can ruin it
[2022-12-30 14:55:48] <%Leysfort> but it hurt them instead
[2022-12-30 14:55:52] <%Enoz___> in norway to get into medical schol you gotta have a score of 6.4 or something. the max character is 6 (=A). So you need like extra stuff besides straight top grades.

[2022-12-30 15:45:32] <%Makkan780> i can join for a key if we do one now whiz got a bit delayed for keys
[2022-12-30 15:45:33] <%Swiggyswoo_> Mythic+ is "technically" harder than mythic raids because there's infinite scaling, but depends on how you look at it
[2022-12-30 15:45:34] <%Makkan780> wat
[2022-12-30 15:45:35] <%Geoffku> yeah pneuma it needed lvl 1 tailoring LUL
[2022-12-30 15:45:35] <%Sne4ky79> 4th time yes
[2022-12-30 15:45:37] <%Bloodmatch> there are mechanics in mythic that arent in heroic
[2022-12-30 15:45:39] <%Aegis_2566> I saw he gifted me multiple subs, no ideaa how thats possible
[2022-12-30 15:45:40] <Sigwarades> I’ve never done Mythic, I’ve only done Heroic as I still need gear
[2022-12-30 15:45:42] <zerdo1234> Hacked monkaS

[2022-12-30 15:46:08] <%bYTEfROG> @PneumaWHU wrathion rep has a 398 cloak
[2022-12-30 15:46:10] <%+Koozzee> i just started playing dragon flight yesterday :/
[2022-12-30 15:46:11] <Sigwarades> I’m still trying to understand the gearing system in the game
[2022-12-30 15:46:16] <Kertirk> Is this a good farm for the elemental overflow? or are you doing it for the achievement?
[2022-12-30 15:46:18] <%+Koozzee> lvl 65 :D
[2022-12-30 15:46:32] <zerdo1234> @Koozzee have fun i hope you enjoy the journey :D
[2022-12-30 15:46:36] <%Sne4ky79> no idea aegis is the only one i hade issue with gifting sub to @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-30 15:46:53] <%Turbopumper> can I join for the m0? :D
[2022-12-30 15:47:01] <%PanicRush> i have an 11, should be easy
[2022-12-30 15:47:08] <Sigwarades> I am EU but I can’t play atm
[2022-12-30 15:47:11] <%Taylor131313> 11 will be hard for someone with 0 experience
[2022-12-30 15:47:15] <%Makkan780> could do a slightly higher for valut. can always lower it at the NPC
[2022-12-30 15:47:15] <%PanicRush> he will get +2 anyway
[2022-12-30 15:47:19] <%Geoffku> makes sense
[2022-12-30 15:47:21] <Sigwarades> Also I don’t have the gear atm
[2022-12-30 15:47:22] <%Taylor131313> no, he will get a 10
[2022-12-30 15:47:25] <%PanicRush> if he doesnt have a key at all he will get +2 regardless
[2022-12-30 15:47:26] <Sigwarades> I’m only 358
[2022-12-30 15:47:26] <%Sne4ky79> i got email and bank account proof it went just fine @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-30 15:47:26] VIEWERS: 1 009
[2022-12-30 15:47:28] <%PanicRush> no
[2022-12-30 15:47:34] <%Enoz___> m0 allways gives +2
[2022-12-30 15:47:35] <%Geoffku> the +2 was a bug
[2022-12-30 15:47:36] <%Wardrick7> you will get higher not +2
[2022-12-30 15:47:36] <%Makkan780> you get the key lvl -1
[2022-12-30 15:47:38] <%Mirkooo> Some got +2, some didnt, it was bugged Sadge
[2022-12-30 15:47:42] <%$Hasan_Lurker> Sadge
[2022-12-30 15:47:43] <%Swiggyswoo_> It was bugged yeah
[2022-12-30 15:47:50] <%PanicRush> ok, my bad then
[2022-12-30 15:47:52] <%Hezmund> 0 gives 2 but if he does an 11 he'll get a 10
[2022-12-30 15:49:08] <%Bitfrost9> what ilvl is good to start M0 in DF? ive been slacking XD
[2022-12-30 15:49:08] <Sigwarades> I’m more interested in trying the raids actually
[2022-12-30 15:49:08] <%Mirkooo> Because we are constantly in combat KEKW
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Taylor131313> you can do M0 at 320
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Makkan780> but he can lower it at the NPC if we do a higher key
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Bloodmatch> 350 for m zero
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Turbopumper> I'm 340 on my dk!!
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%$loppish91> what is he playing we should stack that armor type LUL
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Hezmund> @Bitfrost9 if you have a group you can do it super low, but average would probably be 360+
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Makkan780> 350 is more than enough for a m0
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Sne4ky79> and i hade no gifting subs tbh , just aegis gift sub that been very weird
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%PanicRush> make a group for a dungeon that has a weekly quest - people are more likely to join
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Bitfrost9> fair enough. explains why i get declined at 352 XD
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Bloodmatch> but 320 and skip hc dungeon
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%Hezmund> I can tank on my warr annie YEP
[2022-12-30 15:49:09] <%+ein_sof93> i started tanking m0 at like 330 on my alt warrior

[2022-12-30 15:49:53] <%Bloodmatch> this week should be good as people are doing them for weekly quest
[2022-12-30 15:49:56] <%Makkan780> aalso a lot of people signing, sometimes when i join a key there are 100+ people signed up LULW
[2022-12-30 15:50:08] <Sigwarades> I’m also quite new too so it’s probably better I just farm Mythic to get gear until I try Mythic+

[2022-12-30 15:50:22] <%Hezmund> SBG in particular is a very popular key because it's so easy
[2022-12-30 15:50:27] <%+ein_sof93> im down to tank a key if u need one
[2022-12-30 15:50:30] <%Bitfrost9> in SL i was spoiled playing healer so it was relatively easy finding groups. now as dps, i will probably have to learn to make my groups...
[2022-12-30 15:50:35] <+raltpeter> quickest way I've found to get into 11 keys, therefore primal focus is to just apply for SBG 11.
[2022-12-30 15:50:48] <Wargasha> is there any way to apply to your guild??
[2022-12-30 15:50:56] <zerdo1234> i got the newes corona expansion just in time for new years FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-30 15:50:56] <%Makkan780> and you stat gettign m+ score
[2022-12-30 15:50:56] <%Mirkooo> None
[2022-12-30 15:50:59] <%PanicRush> only fortified/tyr
[2022-12-30 15:51:00] <%Geoffku> fortified

[2022-12-30 15:51:03] <%katattakks> thanks for explaining that. I've asked in my own guild TONS of times if someone could help me understand what a key is. No one responds but then suddenly they're forming their own groups to run keys.
[2022-12-30 15:51:05] <%Mirkooo> oh yeah, fort
[2022-12-30 15:51:05] <+Flenton> and u get an reward next week in the vault from doing m+

[2022-12-30 15:52:11] <%Swiggyswoo_> This weeks affixes are completely free so it's a good one to learn in tbh, get GTFO or smth like LittleWigs for the "standing in AOE"-warning so you dont stand in sanguine
[2022-12-30 15:52:14] <%Makkan780> changes WutFace
[2022-12-30 15:52:16] <%Hezmund> @Sigwarades not set bonuses, they're modifiers to make tyhe dungeon harder
[2022-12-30 15:52:17] <%Swiggyswoo_> Then just learn the dungs

[2022-12-30 15:53:26] <%Makkan780> could spec into knockback spells to help the tank

[2022-12-30 15:53:50] <Sigwarades> What are raids like? Do they give similar gear?
[2022-12-30 15:53:55] <%Enoz___> @Aegis_2566 as a BM hunter I also do not know what this means
[2022-12-30 15:53:56] <%PanicRush> the hardest part is to make a group that doesnt disband after 1 wipe on 1st boss xddx
[2022-12-30 15:53:57] <%$Collnaris> especially with the weekly people will do M0s
[2022-12-30 15:54:08] <Jspace96> anniesHI

[2022-12-30 15:54:14] <zerdo1234> this week is great for doing m0 since you get hero raid item for 4 finished mythic dungeon
[2022-12-30 15:54:18] <%Turbopumper> hardest part is finding other people that are awake
[2022-12-30 15:54:29] <%FafferUK> does everybody get a key at the end of an M0?
