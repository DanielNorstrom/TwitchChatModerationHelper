[2022-12-30 14:52:52] <%$MisterTerpene> @chakmarin IT is possible, look at what they did with light tanks... you can not have more than one LT per platoon... Also, EBRs are matched against EBR... So I would like to see equal amount of BZ on each teams

[2022-12-30 14:52:58] <%Chuckle_x> @MisterTerpene I don't disagree,  for me at least the Bz should never see lower tier tanks in random battles.  But unfortunately that would have the same effect of reducing alot of peoples interest in having one,  so WG would never go for it
[2022-12-30 14:53:01] <thinkcentre1002> ..but it is similar as K91?

[2022-12-30 14:54:03] <+sgt_pigpen> skill.. if i have 40 battles rental, is it worth putting equipment on that thing and use it? i've given up on getting it perm
[2022-12-30 14:54:04] <!chakmarin> @MisterTerpene that is different. they disalowed 2 lights in same platoon in general. so by your logic they would disallow 2 heavy tanks in the same platoon
[2022-12-30 14:54:11] <+CookyCooker> There are only two things WG could do to in a way "rebalance" BZ which are eather change the meta slowly or to buff many other tanks, which are probably not going to happen soon

[2022-12-30 14:55:34] <%+Tonraj> @skill4ltu interesting to see whether BZ will become unicorn similar to EBR75 which they are affraid to sell
[2022-12-30 14:55:35] <@%momix99> @skill4ltu they literally changed the stats of it 1 or 2 days before the release. i dont think anyone could say anything about it at that point

[2022-12-30 15:03:34] <Tunix_2020> it is the "Wargaming meaning" of "free" ;)
[2022-12-30 15:03:34] <Martytv4u> you cant snap shots
[2022-12-30 15:03:35] <+xoutbreakerx> let em free
[2022-12-30 15:03:37] <aeng1s> that gun looks like it has more than 25% rng
[2022-12-30 15:03:38] <%+Sentient_seven> @skill4ltu It's the kinda gun that makes you go bald
[2022-12-30 15:03:48] <!chakmarin> @OG_Detronix I guess that is how you win argunments in your school
[2022-12-30 15:03:48] <daathus> aim time on this tank not so good

[2022-12-30 15:03:51] <%+veldhuus> @skill4ltu brain off and I farm 2m credits an hour in special mode :)
[2022-12-30 15:03:53] <%Chuckle_x> @oxtapous Not to the extent many people believe.  15 equal players will most likely beat 14,  or they should.  So with skill balanced teams first team to lose a tank will likely lose the game

[2022-12-30 15:07:57] <rockmobius888> use vetns rammer and hardening in this tank and play in close combat agreessive...this works the best for me @skill4ltu
[2022-12-30 15:08:10] <+Daddy_Wookie> the chance to get that tank is so low its not even fun to try :|}

[2022-12-30 15:16:36] <evaharbringer> @skill4ltu u are agree..its not a sniper snitzel. I use vents,stab ,aiming and i play close range. Its very competitive close combat and M is easy to get 1200 exp..:))

[2022-12-30 15:17:06] <Pabalabab> and you're still doing enough damage to mark it haha
[2022-12-30 15:17:07] <skarmank> @drunk_and_bored same, one of the worst tanks that I played with, burning like a torch

[2022-12-30 15:17:08] <%CeeZeePeeZee> a-44 is a better tier for tier Pog
[2022-12-30 15:17:12] <DrPagos> too little battles i guess

[2022-12-30 15:17:20] <+bye_acc> Question, wouldn't this tank be better if it turns slower to not by accident over angle? @skill4ltu

[2022-12-30 16:23:58] <%+magmar91> is 283 premium tank or just a reward tank?
[2022-12-30 16:24:06] <KopiumWoT> @Chill667 Same to you, man!
[2022-12-30 16:24:11] <%dodi_fabik> I just bought 15 coins from minerals. At the 9th roll I got 283 permanently. Lucky me! I had aroung 5 battles with it, I got 2.5 avarage...despite I'm an "avarage" player. Standard pen sucks, also  forgot long distance shots with it
[2022-12-30 16:24:13] <dariuszmaterka> jest reward
[2022-12-30 16:24:24] <knezboss> @skill4ltu how many tokens you spend to get it
[2022-12-30 16:24:30] <%WladThunder1> With the chance of getting it it should be premium tank in my opinion. I mean WG made millions on boxes so why the hell not making it kind of a premium tank. I bought 150 boxes, collected all resources and I still havent this tank so its not that simple already to be honest.
[2022-12-30 16:24:41] <+Crazystupidcow> how do u get this tank ?
[2022-12-30 16:24:42] <%+magmar91> @dariuszmaterka ok, thank you

[2022-12-30 16:50:13] <maxvhck> @skill4ltu  it should trade tiers with BZ

[2022-12-30 16:50:38] <Archduke__> @Kasnicka yea there is a sound, but its different for normal tanks, this sound is usually for magazine and auto loaders

[2022-12-30 16:51:35] <%Abyssal_Hawk> it could be something related to how it was supposed to be loaded in real life for the sound. Like the T-72's loading carousel maybe

[2022-12-30 17:18:58] <%Tardigra> @skill4ltu I actually, saluting to you in game, is a very good thing! However some say it's rigging, because there are situations when you gain adwantage, but sometimes it's de-rigging, because players come to salute you, eventhough they know they'll get spanked in exchange. Any ways have a very happ newyear and thanks for your content, peave! :)

In the same time i'm grinding the german medium line and i was hesitating with the E50 or the leopard pta, and i wonder if the E50 is somehow like the T-34-3 and if it may be kinda the same gameplay. Whats your thoughts on that ?

[2022-12-30 17:34:12] <allblue> Looks similar to Obj.430, a bad tank against tier 10, an incredible beast against tier 7

[2022-12-30 17:41:48] <%$ElTorro__4ever> It's like a Char or Phase or Kpz50t
[2022-12-30 17:41:51] <provilius1> in my opinion you need to spam gold on ojb 283 othervise its discusting

[2022-12-30 17:42:01] <triton999> in my opinion tier 6 should never ever meet tier 8. Yesterday I played wiht tiger 131, first game vs BZ and second game vs Defender. I mean wtf is this...

[2022-12-30 17:42:44] <arko1235> @skill4ltu ngl T29 at T9 would perform better without changes than 283
[2022-12-30 17:42:48] <%$OGMadwilly> @skill4ltu it feels like the 283 should be T8 and Bz tier 9 and someone just swapped em at WG.

I can get my revenge now for those players who pressed the 2 button, and penetrated me in my strongest spot on my tourret, and yoloed me for no reason. Finally with my game knowledge and the yolo, I can make 4k and more dmg per game if its not a turbo game lol

[2022-12-30 19:36:05] <michupiczukolok> The funny thing is that I managed to get this tank completely for free. It took maximum 20 tokens. Used to play this game paying for it but now I have a new account which is free2play and it's the best gaming experience ever. I get to appreciate lower tier games, it makes it really special when I get a tank like this for nothing and it takes all toxicity away cause I am a free loader so can not complain to much even if I am getting hard end of the stick at times. Have fun all, enjoy the game:)))

[2022-12-30 20:01:12] <%st4linium_rng> @skill4ltu im not sure but this tank is better to sidescrape than 430 II ?
[2022-12-30 20:01:14] <antonis360r> i consider obj 383 an average good tank and not a garbage one

[2022-12-30 20:01:46] <antonis360r> yes obj 283 is better than 430 ii
[2022-12-30 20:01:47] <%chirop_> i feel eurlier you didn't had a decent handle on the tank yet and were mad on the tank to much for that (tank still not awsome though don't get me wrong)
[2022-12-30 20:01:55] <flamiblejelly> @skill4ltu btw i could not see your camo, the paint on the tank
[2022-12-30 20:02:00] <%mjolnirsson> 430 2 has that massive deck that likes to catch HE damage and burn
[2022-12-30 20:02:17] <@%+evofrogmr> @flamiblejelly do you have non-historical camo off?

[2022-12-30 21:17:47] <bertjonesgoat> How are expectation values are sub 2500 wth
[2022-12-30 21:18:07] <%+Crusader_Lawyer> it has .14 on the move, which isn’t bad. The 2.4 aim time tho might make stabs for ia a problem tho
[2022-12-30 21:18:08] <vmps2pax> @bertjonesgoat because one arty shot halves its hp. among many other things

[2022-12-30 21:50:27] <Xamess> @skill4ltu Expectation values are low because majority of the playerbase got the tank from tokens and played like 2-3 games and go 0 or very low damage, this is the most logical reason for it

[2022-12-30 22:10:10] <%+Viktor___Wolf> @MisterTerpene Very true.  I just don't see enough areas where AMBT is better.
[2022-12-30 22:10:11] <+adopted_scav> @skill4ltu in my opinion 283 isn't bad, just needs slight buffs (small gun handling / velocity) to be actually good. i marked mine in 59 games myself which was slower than i wanted

[2022-12-30 22:10:52] <%$MisterTerpene> @Viktor___Wolf AMBT can terminate enemies quickly by putting 2 rounds and baking off to reload... Pershing or Arnie are less quick to terminate low HP enemies

[2022-12-30 22:18:42] <uncle_gl> idk. there may be possible side e.g. arty missions rigged - less arty in games.
[2022-12-30 22:18:46] <atog1> oh I know exactly what your talinkng about I was platoon with someone  who told me after the matched started they were rigging it with clans mates I told the team in chat abd every one just boxed them in a corner  so the  enemy could   get to them  and they couldnt  do anything  @skill4ltu
[2022-12-30 22:18:53] <chimichumi> @trispect_ my friend. second box. he is literally new player with under 100 matches. we are mad
[2022-12-30 22:18:58] <antonis360r> this tank without IA is bad with Ai is average like 5/10 max
[2022-12-30 22:19:09] <%+sim6mon> I just commented to the Clauss video that the best anti rigging strategy would be not to allow ppl with PR below4k or WN below1k above tier 8 - what do you think?
