[2022-12-19 04:14:56] <%+LusciousTigerAss> quality gold sinks is my thinking
[2022-12-19 04:15:14] <%+LusciousTigerAss> agility is typically for the rogue/ranger types
[2022-12-19 04:15:33] <%+TCisLucky> What happens if you hit the lockpick in the red zone?
[2022-12-19 04:15:38] <Derdy_> why for rogue ranger tho? it doesnt give them damage

[2022-12-19 04:16:08] <%+LusciousTigerAss> idk how this game specifically handles dex. there arent abilities that scale off it?
[2022-12-19 04:16:16] <Derdy_> the curse over agi stat in game is only move speed and attack speed
[2022-12-19 04:16:17] <%illerMack> seqIcozy
[2022-12-19 04:16:39] <%+LusciousTigerAss> those things are pretty important, but how much does the stat actually do.
[2022-12-19 04:16:43] <%+TCisLucky> @LusciousTigerAss agi is for attack speed and interaction speed, so technically yes a dps buff but not direct
[2022-12-19 04:16:50] <%myndgamez_> @Derdy_ Wouldnt call that a curse, both are huge advantages

[2022-12-19 04:52:12] <%That_Steven_Guy> and yeah, sometimes you open a door on a 3 man

[2022-12-19 05:00:00] <magnapuss> The polearm, feels a little too slow for realism imo — they're not that heavy IRL compared to an axe
[2022-12-19 05:00:06] <%+LusciousTigerAss> and if people would even participate in it
[2022-12-19 05:00:20] <%+LusciousTigerAss> magnapuss the game's overall pacing is slow. not about weapons realism
[2022-12-19 05:00:21] <sleepingyeti91> Squad fill would be great, having a hard time getting in with randoms

[2022-12-19 05:01:43] <%+LusciousTigerAss> one thing i found odd, but ofc people all have their own reasons, like playing solo in a game like Darktide, seemed counter intuitive to me
[2022-12-19 05:01:44] <Shublues> Being dismissive towards people who like to play solo is just kinda shitty.
[2022-12-19 05:01:57] <ZVortex246> is this a battle royale?
[2022-12-19 05:02:03] <KanameDarkwind> @Shublues You can still play solo.
[2022-12-19 05:02:05] <magnapuss> @LusciousTigerAss I beg to differ on that affecting weapon speed, although the pacing is slow — such as daggers are fast and that's still realistic
[2022-12-19 05:02:05] <Hard_Corps_> they should add a cod style slide to this game Kappa

[2022-12-19 05:13:25] <%+TCisLucky> @LusciousTigerAss they've stated they are strongly against pay to win iirc which is dope but I don't see why it needs to have a debuff lol.

[2022-12-19 05:13:50] <%+LusciousTigerAss> TCisLucky they unlocked the skele skin in game so i dont see how that fits in the p2w argument
[2022-12-19 05:13:54] <+MadBinxx> The map has changed so much since the last test.
[2022-12-19 05:14:00] <%Ortinoth> if they do something like cosmetics different looks for the characters i am perfectly fine with it

[2022-12-19 05:14:23] <%SeriousMarine> @LusciousTigerAss they actually want it to be pay to lose, so at the star of the test it was -20 +20, they changed to reflect an atual debuff and not a perk against mages
[2022-12-19 05:14:28] <%+LusciousTigerAss> TCisLucky like i said, it shows they have a framework for that, we'll see what they do with it as the games go on.

[2022-12-19 05:14:34] <%+TCisLucky> @LusciousTigerAss Agreed, if it's earned in game it'd be fine to have it just be a skin with no modifiers idk why they had to make it a nerf simply because it's a skin?

[2022-12-19 10:52:55] <%Gavly> you would think the sprite would counteract the tummy ache from the milk
[2022-12-19 10:53:01] <%Gavly> cause carbonation and lemon lime
[2022-12-19 10:53:14] <kryonid> ima have my microwaved steak with a side of milk and sprite now
[2022-12-19 10:53:28] <%ragequitmcgeeee> @Gavly i mean that's one logic path to follow...
[2022-12-19 10:53:33] <%$Majeye> Never thought milk/cream would be alright in alcohol either.. but then you got White Russian as a drink.
[2022-12-19 10:53:41] <%ZCorse91> @Gavly you have to use milk that has already spoiled for the sprite to counteract it
[2022-12-19 10:53:42] <%+Zunahme> Dip you some bacon in the milk
[2022-12-19 10:53:43] <%Gavly> the dollar store sells steaks but im not brave enough
[2022-12-19 10:53:49] <+DrakeLionheart> Do the traps hurt the mobs?
[2022-12-19 10:54:00] <%Gavly> @ZCorse91 that kinda makes sense

[2022-12-19 10:54:30] <OnlyCaleX> @DrakeLionheart Yes they do. You can use them to kill them if you plan it well enough
[2022-12-19 10:54:42] <%Gavly> it's just weird cause sprite and milk is gross, unless you have a sprite AND cereal. then its just getting mixed in your stomach

[2022-12-19 13:48:39] <%its_KANEDA> @StockSavage Not solo friendly at all
[2022-12-19 13:48:39] <%Amebagrinder> @StockSavage You can solo, just gotta be way more careful and clever

[2022-12-19 13:48:47] <Shinsei> There's nothing solo friendly about this game.
[2022-12-19 13:48:59] <StockSavage> ah man. okay thanks lol

[2022-12-19 13:49:52] <%+Dbrn47> not every game has to have multiplayer either, what's your point?
[2022-12-19 13:49:55] <+Nainjaa> @StockSavage  i play a lot of solo , i use archer and invisibility potion :P pick your fight dont let them pick you
[2022-12-19 13:50:03] <%truly_mistaken> they even expanded the map and allowed for more dispersion so u dont even always come across other players

[2022-12-19 13:50:54] <Caffie_> cannot you dual wield the daggers?

[2022-12-19 13:51:21] <StockSavage> @Faebianna thats good to know, just gotta be clever i suppose
[2022-12-19 13:51:26] <%truly_mistaken> @truly_mistaken fair point, but just ads to the capabilities of a solo player

[2022-12-19 13:53:15] <RockRiver> seems like they turned mimic chance way down

[2022-12-19 13:53:25] <gestaltoids> @moosE3knucklE it is and actually its because when you jump on them their buddies will try and hit you still and end up friendly firing to death lol

[2022-12-19 14:24:40] <%SithLordMills> Thank you omnibusone seqLove
[2022-12-19 14:24:40] <TaterSloth> does it do it faster than normal?
[2022-12-19 14:24:40] <%Danrul> in practice I think its fine
[2022-12-19 14:24:41] <quartzito> @Faebianna it is if you plan on going big
[2022-12-19 14:24:42] <TaterSloth> sounds like a bug
[2022-12-19 14:24:43] <TaterSloth> GUMIIII
[2022-12-19 14:24:47] <%+BetterByFarr> rmb
[2022-12-19 14:24:47] <Occidom> The pooop is coming!
[2022-12-19 14:24:52] <Mellowshigh> yea you can use skills to reload it
[2022-12-19 14:24:53] <TaterSloth> @Gumiiii  ily i hope you and voryn are well
[2022-12-19 14:24:58] <%Danrul> the reload happens before the shots, not after, so using the quickshot you end up at 3/6 afterwards
[2022-12-19 14:25:03] <%FishedOut13> Anyone here played FrostPunk? Fun little game, been giving it a try after like a year of it sitting in my library
[2022-12-19 14:25:06] <%truly_mistaken> @Danrul honestly same, quivers are small anyway plus cooldown time
[2022-12-19 14:25:14] <%Danrul> I forget if multishot leaves you at 1/6 or not
[2022-12-19 14:25:21] <%Faebianna> @quartzito is there any other way? seqDag
[2022-12-19 14:25:30] <Gumiiii> @TaterSloth waddup my guy, been a while, it's funny because i was thinking about you yesterday , hope you're doing good as well

[2022-12-19 14:26:07] <%Danrul> @Danrul also, most people wanna use their abilities early to chunk enemies, so most of the time I don't think the cooldowns are being used to create an uncrossable wall of arrows

[2022-12-19 14:27:54] <%Danrul> @velathore ignite can be used to buff magic missiles. I forget if ignited MM applies a burn though

[2022-12-19 14:28:42] <+Mission_MLT> Is the loot better ?when you go through a red portal?

[2022-12-19 14:29:09] <%Danrul> @velathore I forget if it applies a dot, but I know it buffs the damage output itself
[2022-12-19 14:29:19] <%Faebianna> that gulp after every potion sip is so satisfying

[2022-12-19 14:29:48] <%velathore> @velathore I think it does apply a dot. I was just hit with 2 or 3 of the missiles and the fire dot killed me afterwards

[2022-12-19 14:43:26] <%velathore> @Sequisha you're going to need those lockpicks on the rogue. Eventually you'll replace the lockpick perk with a damage one.
[2022-12-19 14:43:30] <%+incrediblejoker> You can trade them in to Santa clause for purps and legs

[2022-12-19 15:01:28] <Makhai_Max> They might go for a lower price since they're doing the cosmetic option
[2022-12-19 15:01:28] <%DrakeLionheart> Was thinking 20 bucks till they add more content
[2022-12-19 15:01:29] <xjohnson> I'd say 20 but inflation would make it 25
[2022-12-19 15:01:29] <lokil93> yeah 30 is good
[2022-12-19 15:01:30] <%SithLordMills> So $60AUD seqKEK seqY
[2022-12-19 15:01:31] <+Furiak> 40 and keep it on 25% off sale all the time

[2022-12-19 15:01:35] <+WolfManZach> be even better if they had a deal on 2/3 copies to get for a friend
[2022-12-19 15:01:35] <1TwistedGuy> I price games with hours $1 per hour
[2022-12-19 15:01:39] <%omnibusone> $40 and free content on couple year roadmap seq1
[2022-12-19 15:01:40] <ChrisCGN> iirc correctly one of the devs was the one who started lootboxes in FIFA and said that this game is his penance for that NODDERS
[2022-12-19 15:01:40] <%Gavlakel> 30 to 40
[2022-12-19 15:01:41] <MiK31988> 79
[2022-12-19 15:01:44] <ReveralX> If they add Customs map and maybe Interchange, i'd pay 60
[2022-12-19 15:01:44] <%+BalMasque> If its too expensive, itll be like Marauders. People were playing it for roughly 2 months and then the player list dropped by a lot
[2022-12-19 15:01:46] <Metrosecksulol> BOGO or bust
[2022-12-19 15:01:47] <surf_machine> when is release though?
[2022-12-19 15:01:48] <bungholio666> Whats the  red portal for
[2022-12-19 15:01:48] <+NoApologies> 59.99
[2022-12-19 15:01:49] <%+NovaScotia> $120 for for the darkest edition MiniK
[2022-12-19 15:01:52] <Jester_TB> i have no doubt that people will eventually buy it anyway
[2022-12-19 15:01:54] <1TwistedGuy> $1 per hour
[2022-12-19 15:01:54] <%Grim_Decisions> as long as i dont have to pay 15 a month im down
[2022-12-19 15:01:56] <FuriousRexus> 30 and then people get it for 20 on sales. Seems fair
[2022-12-19 15:01:59] <xjohnson> Inflation affects the devs just like everyone else
[2022-12-19 15:01:59] <%WindexLive> 20 for starter edition, 30 for upgraded edition with ghost face mask and 5 battle pass skips, 50$ for a shirt and sound track plus previous tiers, and a signed picture of the dev with his dog.
[2022-12-19 15:02:04] <%+turkeygoblins> i dont think more than $30 as fun as it is, unless it gets way more content
[2022-12-19 15:02:04] <%Attckcat> @NovaScotia Now you're talking KEKLEO
[2022-12-19 15:02:04] <%Volcomstone161> BETTER THAN paying 70 dollars for a shit game thats been re rolled every year
[2022-12-19 15:02:04] <Jester_TB> regardless of price
[2022-12-19 15:02:06] <+GenXg_> 20 is cheapskate danHa
[2022-12-19 15:02:06] <MacL0ven> 69.99 the new golden standard KEKW
[2022-12-19 15:02:08] <%velathore> @bungholio666 dive deeper into the dungeon.
[2022-12-19 15:02:09] <%+Xerces88> i agree, a smalelr intro price, say $30 for an intro. id pay that. but anymore without seeing a promise of content release intervals means id hold off
[2022-12-19 15:02:11] <vollpin> 29,99 and a free microwave steak
[2022-12-19 15:02:14] <DuferTV> lol if thats true that is great
[2022-12-19 15:02:20] <iamLars> @bungholio666 It goes to a deeper part of the dungeon with harder enemies and better loot.
[2022-12-19 15:02:23] <FynON> @NovaScotia Edge of Darkness. Oh wait...
[2022-12-19 15:02:36] <%+turkeygoblins> as fun as it is this amount of content is more like $20 max imo. but it could scale really high
[2022-12-19 15:02:41] <TiBiiiscuit> just release an EOD pack and make the inventory 3 more extra squares for 120$ = profit KEKW
[2022-12-19 15:02:41] <@%+AceMcClutch> This game? $100 seems reasonable since im not buying Kappa
[2022-12-19 15:02:43] <%Danrul> I agree with whoever wrote that a bundle that includes multiple copies of the game is a good idea
[2022-12-19 15:02:46] <%velathore> I'm surprised the map isn't pro-gen.

[2022-12-19 15:39:53] <theory_crafter> so do some spells not work then? because my mid heal when aimed at the ground wont heal me
[2022-12-19 15:40:10] <%+Craymel_Mage> Just don't aim at any other target and it self targets the spell. @theory_crafter
[2022-12-19 15:40:26] <Lardo____> @theory_crafter only light heal works as a self heal, you cant heal yourself with the other one I forgot its name
[2022-12-19 15:40:29] <%+Craymel_Mage> Also, one of the clerics spell is ally heal only I think
[2022-12-19 15:40:32] <%omnibusone> your big heal only heals others does dmg to monsters, little heal will work on self

[2022-12-19 20:53:55] <miexar> When I'm running solo Rogue, I like Stealth, Poison, Quiet Footsteps, and Lockpicking. Basically, you're not trying to win 3v1s, just getting around undetected with the loot and taking other solos by surprise
