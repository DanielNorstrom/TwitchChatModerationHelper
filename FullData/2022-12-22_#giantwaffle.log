[2022-12-22 16:51:23] <+Maybe_Glizzengar> @Giantwaffle it's not 200mg of caffeine like drinking coffee. It has alot of nootropics like L-theanine to help combat the caffeine side affects
[2022-12-22 16:51:31] <AIex_0> the energy drink one feels like a toned down version of the pre-workout LUL

[2022-12-22 18:05:12] <%+DemonicHell3> yep
[2022-12-22 18:05:12] <+depatchmode> they don;t have cloud gaming or way to stream your games. they too focus on getting large library and no usefulness. They should look into allowing streaming or VR to compete with Steam

[2022-12-22 18:22:42] <+PrimedDanny> what is the best launcher for modpacks?
[2022-12-22 18:22:46] <InternetPlumber> its AE, storage is mostly based on unique items not total quantitiy
[2022-12-22 18:22:56] <%fishypooos> @nothenewmemeguy yeah it was kinda cool, worth checking vod
[2022-12-22 18:22:59] <+galaxy_berry> I hate that computer storage mod. It never balances items correctly so it'll load drives with different items and not stack

[2022-12-22 23:26:28] <PureSpider> ampere is depending on voltage
[2022-12-22 23:26:29] <LinkToTheJake> so 69EU = .5?

[2022-12-22 23:27:25] <PureSpider> think of ampere as "parcels", so one "parcel" of 128EU every tick is 1A

[2022-12-22 23:27:50] <GoksiiLija> more EU
[2022-12-22 23:27:51] <%+MetalBBA> you don't pull less than 1 amp. the machines have a small buffer and will top up when 1 amp of their power tier is available. and any recipe done in a higher tier machine than the recipe will operate as overclocked to that tier of power
[2022-12-22 23:27:54] <+NerdNik> I hate to not have an overview of "everything" in these type of games
[2022-12-22 23:27:56] <PureSpider> one "parcel" of the limit of that voltage is one amp, so 128EU/t = 1A at MV
[2022-12-22 23:28:00] <+19rhys> aint happening

[2022-12-22 23:29:17] <%+MetalBBA> overclocking runs at 4xpower and 2x operation speed per tier. ex an lv recipe in an hv machine would run 4x as fast but use 16x lv power which is hv power

[2022-12-22 23:29:39] <PureSpider> important thing is also that 32EU/t x 4 is not the same as 128EU/t x 1

[2022-12-22 23:41:38] <Amraki> @PureSpider i recently had my consult so i only know what i've been told. i suppose it's hard for doctors to cover every edge case so as a general rule they suggest not getting the surgery if you think you'll want to reverse it in case it can't be undone.
