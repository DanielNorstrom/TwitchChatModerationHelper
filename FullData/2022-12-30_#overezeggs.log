[2022-12-30 02:24:32] <%haiddon> metal gear rising was kind of special, it was started by kojima then handed off to platinum, but that said, it's still a metal gear game and there's so much context you can understand if you've played the other games
[2022-12-30 02:24:42] <%FallenAngel0103> alot
[2022-12-30 02:24:45] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> SO much

[2022-12-30 02:30:10] <%+demidog666> ACKTUALLY emulation isnt illegal its the the way you obtain the iso's/roms
[2022-12-30 02:30:17] <%haiddon> well the earliest game in the timeline is mgs 3, then 5, then metal gear 1, then 2, then metal gear solid 1, metal gear solid 2, metal gear solid 4 is the latest in the timeline canonically, but metal gear rising takes place after it
[2022-12-30 02:30:17] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> emulation isn't against the law in it of itself Egg KEKW
