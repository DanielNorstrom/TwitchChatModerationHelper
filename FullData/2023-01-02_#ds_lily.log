Theres 0 social aspect in copy pasting a whisper from trade site, and the system in place allows currency bots to ruin trade leagues.
[2023-01-02 00:10:23] <%dcirusc30> its a useless discord apart from bulk selling like someone stated other than that it has no use or purpose other than idiots who rmt

[2023-01-02 00:12:41] <!%Bisholio> 80% is a bold statement
[2023-01-02 00:12:50] <%majesticdolphin> if you think most ppl who dont like tft dont know how discord works..
[2023-01-02 00:13:02] <%Ara_Memnoch> rmt'rs make up so much of osrs players, it's sad
[2023-01-02 00:13:12] <itschad> just did my first eater of worlds for the league and got a ashes :)
[2023-01-02 00:13:12] <MiscStomp> i wish my trade chat was like that
[2023-01-02 00:13:14] <%dada_engine> is there anything complicated about how discord works
[2023-01-02 00:13:18] <%majesticdolphin> i dont hate on rmt'ing in games like poe
[2023-01-02 00:13:20] <%dcirusc30> @majesticdolphin  i was in a rota before few days ago this 1 dudes (rf jugg) life was yoyo'n up and down in a chyula so much he died 4 times in 5 rotas lol

[2023-01-02 00:13:28] <dyxlesicfaerlina> @Ara_Memnoch i could care less tho bc rmters dont change my runescape experience
[2023-01-02 00:13:35] <RednelSlendeR> @Arenty 80% of ppl that dislike tft want the qol provided by them to be in the game instead
[2023-01-02 00:13:46] <kermeck100> 100% not a hot take
[2023-01-02 00:13:50] <kermeck100> its true
[2023-01-02 00:13:59] <Hekrops> if u just give the discord mods what they want its all good right? easy
[2023-01-02 00:14:03] <rixaN_> its not much of a thing in HC i dont think
[2023-01-02 00:14:07] <rixaN_> and if SC suffers who cares
[2023-01-02 00:14:09] <$Lv1000> TFT is the only place that I can easily buy heist stuff in bulk. And I hate it.
[2023-01-02 00:14:13] <%Nite01> this build feels about 10000x times better with Lifetap now...

[2023-01-02 00:14:19] <%Nite01> wish I did that earlier
[2023-01-02 00:14:23] <%alluviumearth> in asia rmt is just another facet of the game
[2023-01-02 00:14:28] <DarthIgnis> its not much thing in games that dont have pvp i would say
[2023-01-02 00:14:29] <%alluviumearth> you min max your rmt
[2023-01-02 00:14:30] <rixaN_> dont admit that smh
[2023-01-02 00:14:32] <dyxlesicfaerlina> I honestly could care less about RMT on most games unless it gives you some sort of PVP advantage. Make your bag, i could care less. But the problem is RMT turns predatory alot, people using fraud and then selling premium currencies
[2023-01-02 00:14:33] <%MuffinWasTaken> to some degree RMT and bots are needed to make the economy not complete garbage

[2023-01-02 00:14:40] <@%^Nightbot> i dunno
[2023-01-02 00:14:41] <%Ara_Memnoch> it's just a bad mentality, to view any game as a money making scheme...like they're not happy people, and horrid to be around
[2023-01-02 00:14:51] <%majesticdolphin> ?
[2023-01-02 00:14:53] <pimpron18> not everyone can have big ppL

[2023-01-02 00:15:18] <ayy_was_gud> i never understood why pay for items in a game thats about progressing, pay to skip and quit
[2023-01-02 00:15:20] <dyxlesicfaerlina> Alot of people who RMT on runescape are venezuelans who literally do it because going to a real job pays 10% of what RMTing does. It helps them survive.

[2023-01-02 00:24:47] <%majesticdolphin> if you had to spend 15-20 mins a map in poe you would quit. it would take weeks to farm semi-rare items from bosses.

[2023-01-02 00:26:17] <Andraste____> it can do no wrong

[2023-01-02 00:27:08] <gatorfu> end game should be just that
[2023-01-02 00:27:08] <+c0refreAk> D2 is great but the gap between melee and caster is even bigger than in PoE
[2023-01-02 00:27:13] <+c0refreAk> literally unplayable without gear
[2023-01-02 00:27:17] <+continentofhawaii> Player numbers = better
[2023-01-02 00:27:19] <jameziez> tells you in battlenet
[2023-01-02 00:27:23] <%Nite01> d2 endgame is just about trading, farming perfect items, its just a different thing
[2023-01-02 00:27:23] <%Svettgurkan> his dad works at Blizzard NODDERS
[2023-01-02 00:27:24] <%majesticdolphin> where is the numbers that say d2r is pulling more than a few 1000
[2023-01-02 00:27:25] <+BossB0hne> At the bottom of the chart
[2023-01-02 00:27:25] <emptysys> "every" league lmao
[2023-01-02 00:27:37] <Tazeko> d2r is pretty fun but its still just d2 meta aint changed
[2023-01-02 00:27:39] <%LeeChoupey> PoE is a super niche game
[2023-01-02 00:27:52] <Hekrops> poe is just d2 with a shitload of skinner box shit piled on top of what is otherwise a straight up ripoff
[2023-01-02 00:28:02] <Navveo> @LeeChoupey not really anymore
[2023-01-02 00:28:06] <lolbliterate> poe is just d2 with a shitload of skinner box shit piled on top of what is otherwise a straight up ripoff

[2023-01-02 00:28:15] <%Svettgurkan> I wouldn't call PoE a niche game, Dwarf Fortress is a niche game, everyone knows PoE and has played PoE
[2023-01-02 00:28:15] <+c0refreAk> PoE wishes to be D2, thats atleast their vision KEKW

[2023-01-02 00:29:02] <%majesticdolphin> d4 forced multiplayer with surely kill poe
[2023-01-02 00:29:18] <%Svettgurkan> D4 isn't really competing with PoE though, seems more aimed at Lost Ark
[2023-01-02 00:29:26] <feistigames> although you are hardcore, so things are more expensive
[2023-01-02 00:29:30] <+virulenzz> do you sell your old builds on rerolls or just bench them?
[2023-01-02 00:29:31] <%LeeChoupey> yeah , d4 will be giga casual
