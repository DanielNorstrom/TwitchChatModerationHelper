[2022-12-13 05:05:44] <@%KafroHudrep> i think what's most important is to like not value an entertainer so much that you're willing to go out and defend them when they do an extremely bad thing which is something i've seen regularly

[2022-12-13 05:51:35] <@%KafroHudrep> people have streamed it

[2022-12-13 07:04:08] <%SnackoRacko> maybe he needs a hug?
[2022-12-13 07:04:10] <behoimi__> maybe ask him politely?
[2022-12-13 07:04:15] <mauno_mau> Ooh, it's neat to realize why certain things are the way they are.
[2022-12-13 07:04:17] <CrabWisdom> I wonder where the hint is supposed to be for getting in
[2022-12-13 07:04:20] <%rotarybubbles> maybe he just wants a kiss

[2022-12-13 08:35:48] <%Girutea> but the map could use some work

[2022-12-13 08:36:14] <%Girutea> especially dealing w demise
[2022-12-13 08:36:25] <+masumi_tv> Skyward Sword has serious backseating issues that dragged it down for some. Which got fixed on the switch version.
[2022-12-13 08:36:28] <@%KafroHudrep> i'm really not looking to Zelda for any kind of story tbh if i wanted a story that would make me cry I would play Freshly Picked Tingle's Balloon of Love

[2022-12-13 09:21:57] <c0ugar> he throws it on the ground and stomps on it and then spits on the pieces
[2022-12-13 09:22:04] <%BearEatSalmon> since ganon doesnt recognise him as a threat otherwise
