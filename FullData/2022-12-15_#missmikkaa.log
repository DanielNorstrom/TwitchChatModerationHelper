No sense man, I understood nothing, so I remembered that nightmare now, so I typed what's on m

[2022-12-15 18:29:12] <%writer_thirteen> @bam1551 fromsoft doesn't know how to program for keyboard and mouse. controller is a must.
[2022-12-15 18:29:14] <%guille92h> now that i think the person that said not so difficult cause you are tanking, well is an strategy, so maybe is that they are not good doing tactics
[2022-12-15 18:29:25] <@%Radolov> 40 is the first cap, then 60 is pretty much stop
[2022-12-15 18:29:30] <bullets_wont_work_jon> its around like 55 or something?

[2022-12-15 19:06:42] <%Ashewyn> @Ashewyn Yeah she's so nice to have as background content as well! I agree with streams that you can lurk to without getting surprised is very comfy ashewyCOMF
[2022-12-15 19:06:43] <%Gypsylights> your voice comes from my center channel kabeh and yoshi come from left

[2022-12-15 19:06:48] <oweknow3> Stock in your own personal self worth is based on how well your streams or videos are perrforming

[2022-12-15 19:06:59] <%bob_of_thunder> Yeah Mikkaa's stream has been keeping me company at work this year and even though my attention to it can be spotty at best she's very pleasant to listen to at least. mikkaaCare
[2022-12-15 19:07:00] <gastyortigoza> that's a good way to put it
[2022-12-15 19:07:03] <%jerzh93> only watch the numbers on bank account
[2022-12-15 19:07:05] <%ct2499a> metrics... that would drive a perfectionist crazy.
[2022-12-15 19:07:09] <gastyortigoza> more is more
[2022-12-15 19:07:10] <mudman2427> some of the best streams ive seen dont have high viewer counts, agreed
[2022-12-15 19:07:16] <%Gypsylights> we like to see our hero score
[2022-12-15 19:07:24] <+ConanOfLibraria> yeah, a constant feedback loop of self perception of stream value you have no control over and can correlate to infinite influences on the days of viewers instead could really be maddening
[2022-12-15 19:07:52] <%b3ggz> viewership aint about the numbers, its about the amount of love NODDERS
[2022-12-15 19:07:57] <@%K3nzz0> 100% agreed
[2022-12-15 19:08:02] <mmiwo> Well you have to do something good if you have high view count
[2022-12-15 19:08:05] <%devoidj> I feel like when I started watching Mikkaa she was around 1k regular viewers, its really gone up since then. this is a good community too.
[2022-12-15 19:08:07] <+DryRoastedLemon> I mean, it's just data, and it can be useful. But at the same time you shouldn't be looking at it all the time. It's not one or the other. It's both.
[2022-12-15 19:08:07] <JRScribe> the value put into it.. well said, we give numbers much more value
[2022-12-15 19:08:11] <%+Evidicus> Like any business, looking at the numbers quarterly or annually can help, but daily is just going to create anxiety

[2022-12-15 19:09:41] <%ct2499a> you need to hire an editor to make videos for you in order to grow more
[2022-12-15 19:09:42] <+BeMillzz> But it’s better when you are the one running everything. Take shroud for example, he’s said in the past he has people running his social medias for him. When it’s you running everything it’s more personal for your fans/viewers

[2022-12-15 19:14:49] <+ConanOfLibraria> @HaeuptlingHirnschiss ambidextrous/ambidexterity is similar ort equal ability to use both sides of the body, so instead of left handed or right handed, you don't have a dominant or suboirdinate side

[2022-12-15 19:15:35] <%Spazayd> @scrimmage99 Hmm I think as someone said, to counter that definitely get some Holy protection. Elden Stars doesnt do that much damage unless you get hit by the explosion. The sword attacks, just start focusing on the timing and doging those instead of worrying about dodging Elden Stars

[2022-12-15 19:43:20] <%Loooooooooooookas> i like all VODs since i am new and dont know your older content
[2022-12-15 19:43:20] <ImJustRoids> I think VOD channels are always a good idea. Either single video per stream or breaking up streams into parts. Either way.
[2022-12-15 19:43:21] <%LunchboxZez> i think you can just link twitch and youtube cant you?
[2022-12-15 19:43:24] <%Thydus_76> Mikka Built Diff NODDERS
[2022-12-15 19:43:28] <FL0W_STATE> you can auto upload to youtube from twitch
[2022-12-15 19:43:32] <@%Yruhatin> I tried a software that did the downloading but I'd need more time to fine tune it, but I could look into it
[2022-12-15 19:43:37] <YouDoneDidit24> whos idea was this? did it just down on you to try this?
[2022-12-15 19:43:42] <sarthugsin> u secretly forsen?
[2022-12-15 19:43:44] <Ravaiim_> and in the fufure doggo is playing the third copy?
[2022-12-15 19:43:48] <gkar2012> theres a setting in twitch that auto uploads streams to youtube
[2022-12-15 19:43:48] <%+riussu> twitch has an integration, you just have to link a youtube channel and then when you end stream you click a button that uploads it automatically if I remember correctly
[2022-12-15 19:43:59] <Viktor_Kadic> are you allowed to stall and run around in one fight while you do the other? this run is crazy debugUwU

[2022-12-15 19:48:07] <%spillendabeans> change ashes of war too?
[2022-12-15 19:48:10] <Ravaiim_> @ConanOfLibraria you should have had a look, when the game released. people were like "uuuh, u using ashes? i did it all by myself" xD
[2022-12-15 19:48:10] <mmiwo> 3 minutes sounds really short time
[2022-12-15 19:48:12] <YouDoneDidit24> the judgment gotta be harsh at times
[2022-12-15 19:48:13] <%LunchboxZez> 2 game speedrun boss fight incoming
[2022-12-15 19:48:15] <%bob_of_thunder> she's done no death and lvl 1 runs so she's very familiar with beating the game without being tanky, haha
[2022-12-15 19:48:18] <+ConanOfLibraria> it is wildly impressive, and trying to make an argument against that based on the use of basic game mechanics is some real smolpp energy
[2022-12-15 19:48:25] <%JRayJ23> Stop worrying about that.
[2022-12-15 19:48:27] <%Thydus_76> people talking shit and haven't played the game at all sit down doubters LUL
[2022-12-15 19:48:27] <%LunchboxZez> "easy"
[2022-12-15 19:48:34] <YouDoneDidit24> i mean yes
[2022-12-15 19:48:37] <$carlos_ahh> This is impressively impressive

[2022-12-15 19:48:43] <%MikeRNight> I think this run is amazing. Anyone claiming there's anything "easy" about it is an idiot
[2022-12-15 19:48:49] <%paraclitus_666> @LunchboxZez {eacy} is more nice.
[2022-12-15 19:48:51] <Maru_illo> STRUT
[2022-12-15 19:48:52] <MattyArc204> people who say tanking makes it "easy" ignore the fact that she is able to coordinate 2 games AND read chat.
[2022-12-15 19:48:53] <+DryRoastedLemon> Man people are just always trying to be negative and trying to shoot other people down. I just kind of try to ignore all that nonsense.

[2022-12-15 20:47:08] <+ConanOfLibraria> I'm not sure how the breakage is happening, would it make any sense to get a frame to hold it in place, would that do anything to reduce the breaking issues or not so much?
[2022-12-15 20:47:11] <+dvoraktheaugust> You should design and fabricate a custom dance pad.

[2022-12-15 21:11:17] <Teg101> Make sure to wash your hands before you have to go peepee.
[2022-12-15 21:11:19] <Ttauket_Tiaouquette> @sniper2784 Can be even dangerous with the very spicy ones

[2022-12-15 21:11:41] <%$CMPethy> clean hands are happy hands
[2022-12-15 21:11:42] <@%Yruhatin> @bmap72 hahahahhaha
[2022-12-15 21:11:43] <%FernoFry> you shouldnt even be touching a reaper with bare skin
[2022-12-15 21:11:45] <%h0tperse> dont pick your nose after eating those mikkaaMmh

[2022-12-15 21:12:00] <%zylowolf8> Thanks for the great stream, Mikkaa
[2022-12-15 21:12:09] <%RinkRB> @Yruhatin clean hands before doing what
[2022-12-15 21:12:09] <@%xblom> @bmap72 golf
[2022-12-15 21:12:10] <%FernoFry> you have to wear gloves for carolina reapers
[2022-12-15 21:12:11] <@%K3nzz0> Clap for brave Mikkaa
[2022-12-15 21:12:12] <%oldgamer1963> according to google Can capsaicin hurt you? Our body senses capsaicin, the major active compound in chillies, and immediately responds to it. But there's no serious physical damage occurring to the cells. Capsaicin is “tricking” the body into thinking it's experiencing a real burn.

[2022-12-15 21:12:32] <@%Yruhatin> I didn't wear gloves. but I was a bit drunk mikkaaS mikkaaS
[2022-12-15 21:12:35] <IVIarto> I feel like I've missed some shit. Is the milk bc you've eaten some spicy shit or do you just like milk?
[2022-12-15 21:12:38] <jojoforthew_> hiiiui
[2022-12-15 21:12:38] <@%Yruhatin> yeah, I would. 100%
[2022-12-15 21:12:44] <%dangerousfella> even jalapeno's when handled improperly can lead to serious consequences
[2022-12-15 21:12:47] <%dangerousfella> trust me
[2022-12-15 21:12:48] <@%Yruhatin> so I could eat it ofc

[2022-12-15 21:13:24] <+rudybooliani> I use to prep an insane amount of Jalapeño at my work and my hands would sting at the end of the night if I didn’t wear gloves, regardless of constant hand washing
