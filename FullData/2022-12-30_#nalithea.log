[2022-12-30 13:24:16] <JombaJoo> what about youtube
[2022-12-30 13:24:23] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea apparently you don't get a streaming Key for tiktok if you don't live in the US

[2022-12-30 13:25:55] <@%$jadesapphirevt> unless you already are established in youtube, its so much harder to reach out to communities
[2022-12-30 13:25:58] <%+Grim_Faith> yt is definitely not easier to grow. but if you have established fanbase that will follow you, it's definitely a times better platform
[2022-12-30 13:26:02] <%MoodieHoodieVT> youtube is very strict at copyrights
[2022-12-30 13:26:35] VIEWERS: 63

[2022-12-30 14:12:44] <%Vinnie_PT> If you dabble in bitcoin I can send you some Sats. No banks involved
[2022-12-30 14:12:53] <@%Grimstab77> @Doodlebam I agree. Same in France, most companies of services or production take the entire week between christmas and new year off. Only the proximity shops are open during that time

[2022-12-30 14:13:47] <%+Grim_Faith> yt won't ban you for such a trivial matter, they only demonetize the vid or the vod of the stream if you don't cut out the part with the copyrighted content

[2022-12-30 14:16:12] <%+Grim_Faith> @Nalithea do you have revolut? if your donos are done through revolut you get 100% of the donated amount instantly
[2022-12-30 14:16:13] <%+Doodlebam> you dont have to feel sorry about showing emotion. we dont feel bad because of how you express emotion, we just want you to know that we care about you
[2022-12-30 14:16:21] <@%Grimstab77> @mistacol it was some "suspicious activity"

[2022-12-30 14:16:50] <%prankbg> @Grim_Faith yeah a couple of the stremers i watch do donates through revolut
[2022-12-30 14:16:58] <%+MALYG0S> Nali don't think negatively about it. That's only bringing you down more. The problem will get resolved after New Year's.
[2022-12-30 14:17:07] <@%Grimstab77> @Grim_Faith you cannot make dono integrated to the stream with revolut or other stuff like that

[2022-12-30 14:18:01] <%+pyromana192> after new years it will be over twitch staff will be back and they will resolve the ticket
[2022-12-30 14:18:01] <%$vikbarkrat> Agreed with @borky97 @malyg0s @grimstab77 but is only human to be worried and stress
[2022-12-30 14:18:05] <%prankbg> @Nalithea no worries nali, i can see that something is bothering alltho i dont have context
[2022-12-30 14:18:08] <%+Grim_Faith> @Grimstab77 you can actually. a big bulgarian stream i watch uses revolut as a way of people to donate
[2022-12-30 14:18:25] <%$vikbarkrat> Even if we all mean good and try to make her feel better nali will still be worried and sad nalithCry nalithCry
[2022-12-30 14:18:29] <%+Grim_Faith> @Grimstab77 it's from him that i learned revolut can be used

[2022-12-30 14:19:13] <@%Grimstab77> That's what I mean
[2022-12-30 14:19:24] <%+Grim_Faith> it's just a way to get 100% of the money instantly
[2022-12-30 14:19:45] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea if you really want to make sure your ticket wasn't lost. You can open a second ticket again. But it will only be answered once and next week.
[2022-12-30 14:19:47] <%+Grim_Faith> to hell with the alerts, he just reads the dono and thanks the person
[2022-12-30 14:19:49] <%prankbg> that sounds so unfair

[2022-12-30 14:32:24] <@%Grimstab77> The point in going live is to see us in this situation. We're there for you.
[2022-12-30 14:32:40] <@%+Borky97> I believe it's just a huge mistake with twitch
[2022-12-30 14:32:45] <%월향검 (wer2r2)> @nalithea Yes, go to sleep. A person needs to sleep well to recover. Otherwise, Korean obba will visit you and sing you a lullaby

[2022-12-30 14:32:49] <%D4RK_FanTazy_> @grimstab77 No No you are definitely wrong there, infact you are the best one maybe, people say failures are the best guides and I think your philosophy rings more bcuz they come from experience
[2022-12-30 14:32:50] <@%Grimstab77> @husarz93360 we talked about that. Twitch has suspended her payout because of "suspicious activity".
[2022-12-30 14:32:51] <the_sev0> nothings gonna happen to you Im sure that everything will turn out well

[2022-12-30 14:33:48] <@%Grimstab77> @D4RK_FanTazy_ proof is my philosophy just doesn't work if I do such bad things as hurting ppl I love.
[2022-12-30 14:33:49] <%DragonFruitIsYummy> try to stay active, too much sleeping can cause depressive episodes
[2022-12-30 14:33:49] <%husarz93360> @grimstab77 twitch doing strange bs again
[2022-12-30 14:34:03] <@%Grimstab77> that was so harsh from twitch to do that yes

[2022-12-30 20:34:59] VIEWERS: 845
[2022-12-30 20:35:07] <@%Grimstab77> well basically mercy isn't a character that is designed to impact the game directly with dmg.
[2022-12-30 20:35:33] <@%Grimstab77> Also her pistol is only situational. If you want to have better impact AND better chances of winning, her stick has more value.
[2022-12-30 20:36:01] <laughy13> mercy pistol is only good up close
[2022-12-30 20:36:01] <+thegoddiamond> u dont need lucio just move faster
[2022-12-30 20:36:12] <@%Grimstab77> Unless you get flanked and need to defend yourself, or catch someone offguard or even finishing low HP target. that's pretty much the only situations where you want to use her pistol
[2022-12-30 20:36:32] <aki_tari> Lucio speed is so good for both positioning and peeling.
[2022-12-30 20:36:59] VIEWERS: 854
[2022-12-30 20:37:09] <@%Grimstab77> Lucio speedboost is really strong
[2022-12-30 20:37:47] <Deku_vt> He kinda underrated tbh
[2022-12-30 20:37:49] <laughy13> i just really suck at lucio so id rather not throw my games
[2022-12-30 20:37:56] <@%Grimstab77> If you want to have good impact on lucio. Speed your team in, make engagement with speed. Use amp up to heal sometimes. Or healing when you're team doesn't need to catch up the enemey team.
[2022-12-30 20:38:03] <aki_tari> Lucio needs to heal, too, but you need to provide the speed utility more.
[2022-12-30 20:38:20] <@%Grimstab77> Also place yourself as lucio in positioning to be able to peel for your teammates or annoy the enemy backline
[2022-12-30 20:38:32] <@%Grimstab77> that's how you can rank up and have very good impact with lucio
[2022-12-30 20:38:34] <+NxKuuro> i like lucio but i prefer support dps moira i always aim for 10k healing and 5k dmg sometimes. today i got 24k healing and 12k damage
