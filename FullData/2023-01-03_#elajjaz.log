[2023-01-03 12:01:42] <%saugo> yeah I will
[2023-01-03 12:01:59] <%+Moepsiii> i recently started dming pathfinder 2e
[2023-01-03 12:02:10] <%saugo> monkaW Fey? I'm just starting don't know anything about nuthing yet LULW no spoilers please Danki
[2023-01-03 12:02:23] <%saugo> Ooh hey old monkaW is back
[2023-01-03 12:02:36] <%saugo> @Moepsiii How is 2e? i've never played it
[2023-01-03 12:02:50] <%+Moepsiii> its like 5e but with actual rules that work
[2023-01-03 12:03:03] <%+Moepsiii> and actual balance
[2023-01-03 12:03:16] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> Nerdy played through pathfinder this year and the only thing i remember from this playthrough is that he made his party formation to look like a cock YEP
[2023-01-03 12:03:29] <%saugo> huh, might not be too bad then, if we ever move on from 3.5 / pf 1 then I'll remember that as an option elaSmile
[2023-01-03 12:03:39] <%saugo> @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment COCKA
[2023-01-03 12:03:42] <%+Moepsiii> its nothing like pathfinder 1e thou
[2023-01-03 12:03:53] <%+Moepsiii> dont expect characters to have +60 to a roll
[2023-01-03 12:04:01] <%saugo> yeah I figured if it's closer to 5e
[2023-01-03 12:04:07] <%$ToxicBurrito> widepeepoHappy ah nerdy the dungeon master
[2023-01-03 12:04:15] <%+Moepsiii> but the 2 best things in the game are
[2023-01-03 12:04:21] <%+Moepsiii> 3 actions
[2023-01-03 12:04:23] <%saugo> I know 5e rules tho
[2023-01-03 12:04:25] <%+Moepsiii> you can attack 3 times at level 1
[2023-01-03 12:04:29] <%+Moepsiii> if you want
[2023-01-03 12:04:36] <%saugo> Really? damn
[2023-01-03 12:04:49] <%+Moepsiii> and critical success being on a +10 instead of just a 20
[2023-01-03 12:04:50] <%saugo> Can't wait for more Henry13 Clap
[2023-01-03 12:05:01] <%+Moepsiii> so if the dc is 15 and you roll a 25 you crit
[2023-01-03 12:05:06] <%saugo> @Moepsiii I see elaHmm
[2023-01-03 12:05:28] <%+Moepsiii> and the game is really really well balanced
[2023-01-03 12:05:29] <%saugo> and maybe get something extra I guess?
[2023-01-03 12:05:32] <%+Moepsiii> almost to well
[2023-01-03 12:05:42] <%+Moepsiii> yeah spells are no longer save or suck
[2023-01-03 12:05:50] <%+Moepsiii> but save to suck harder
[2023-01-03 12:06:03] <%$ToxicBurrito> ElaMic
[2023-01-03 12:06:13] <%saugo> As long as the classes don't feel like carbon copies with differend colors strapped in it's good. it was my problem with 4e
[2023-01-03 12:06:18] <%+Moepsiii> like even on a succesful save the spell often still does abit
[2023-01-03 12:07:04] <%+Moepsiii> oh no the classes are quite different
[2023-01-03 12:07:15] <%saugo> elaHmm I see I see
[2023-01-03 12:07:19] <%+Moepsiii> one of the funnier ones is the thaumathurge
[2023-01-03 12:07:37] <%+Moepsiii> he can spot the weakness of every monster and always has some sort of item suddenly appear in his inventory
[2023-01-03 12:07:51] <%+Moepsiii> which work as catalyst against that monster
[2023-01-03 12:08:27] <%+Moepsiii> oh no water elementals? good thing i have this sand in my pocket from this specific trip i took to this specific beach and as we all know sand absorbs water so it will weaken the water elemental
[2023-01-03 12:08:28] <%Grom_mash> like when you said you felt so happy you could die
[2023-01-03 12:08:59] <%+Moepsiii> basically you can think of some bullshit reason why the monster gets weakend by coming up with an temporary item you have
[2023-01-03 12:09:09] <%saugo> @Moepsiii LULW might be fun to play actually
[2023-01-03 12:09:11] <%+Moepsiii> and you just have it on you
[2023-01-03 12:09:22] <%Grom_mash> this dude moepsii blocked me
[2023-01-03 12:09:26] <%Grom_mash> when i never talked to him
[2023-01-03 12:09:29] <%Grom_mash> hilarious
[2023-01-03 12:09:31] <%saugo> soulds like a ela5Head character
[2023-01-03 12:09:45] <%+Moepsiii> theres also a feat for that, where youre like oh man i wish i had a shovel but the feat is like oh yeah you had a shovel all along
[2023-01-03 12:10:07] <%saugo> 4Shrug grom
[2023-01-03 12:10:24] <%+Moepsiii> no the ela5Head is the investigator
[2023-01-03 12:10:28] <%super_spyro> @ToxicBurrito I dunno f im doing Sadeg
[2023-01-03 12:10:38] <%Grom_mash> @saugo lol
[2023-01-03 12:10:45] <%+Moepsiii> the investigator class is like batman detective mode
[2023-01-03 12:10:52] <%Grom_mash> WCYD
[2023-01-03 12:11:12] <%saugo> yeah I've seen something like that in this edition as well, might have been homebrew. you get to prepare items retroactivelly
[2023-01-03 12:11:15] <%+Moepsiii> he can investigate a scene and the dm has to come up with a story what happend here and describe it
[2023-01-03 12:11:20] <%huppybara> saugo sealArrive

[2023-01-03 12:15:04] <%+Moepsiii> right now were playing abomination vaults the adventeure path
[2023-01-03 12:15:15] <%saugo> is it any good?
[2023-01-03 12:15:26] <%saugo> or I guess, but like more than normal LULW
[2023-01-03 12:15:29] <%+Moepsiii> i almost tpk the party every encounter with moderate difficulty encounter
[2023-01-03 12:15:36] <%+Moepsiii> dunno Sadge
[2023-01-03 12:15:43] <%+Moepsiii> my party explores one room in 4 hours
[2023-01-03 12:15:53] <%saugo> LULW
[2023-01-03 12:15:53] <%+Moepsiii> and theres 500 rooms in the whole dungeon
[2023-01-03 12:16:05] <%saugo> Is it your irl friends or sope people you met online to play?
[2023-01-03 12:16:12] <%+Moepsiii> from elas discord
[2023-01-03 12:16:38] <%+Moepsiii> remus, krezal, crab, syches and epitaph
[2023-01-03 12:17:31] <%+Moepsiii> we played a homebrew campaign before in 5e but i got sick of 5e
[2023-01-03 12:17:33] <%saugo> Yeah might feel a bit slow, though it is like that sometimes. I like to chat with my players a bit during slow times and create a bit of immersion, but we know each other irl and play live so the atmosphere is a bit different. I can also 'subtly' remind them that they are lagging LULW
[2023-01-03 12:18:07] <%+Moepsiii> its mostly like: woah hold on, theres a door what do we do now?!
[2023-01-03 12:18:26] <%saugo> 5e is pretty user friendly for beginners, even though I'm not crazy about it on the whole
[2023-01-03 12:18:31] <@%^StreamElements> Twotter: twitter.com/elajjaz
[2023-01-03 12:18:33] <%+Moepsiii> we open it? no we cant just open it, what if its trapped? or magically enchanted? or theres monsters behind it
[2023-01-03 12:18:41] <%saugo> LULW that will pass, it's just cause it's so new and fun
[2023-01-03 12:18:48] <%+Moepsiii> describe door Okayeg
[2023-01-03 12:18:53] <%saugo> LULW
[2023-01-03 12:18:56] <%carnivorexi> YEP
[2023-01-03 12:19:01] <%+Moepsiii> its a door...?
[2023-01-03 12:19:14] <%+Moepsiii> maybe if the dm says its just a door it might be a mimic
[2023-01-03 12:19:44] <%+Moepsiii> he never used a door in a whole year of playing but this might be the perfect time for him to make this a mimic
[2023-01-03 12:20:07] <%+Moepsiii> then they start discussing, then someone gets annoyed and starts an argument
[2023-01-03 12:20:22] <%+Moepsiii> then someone maybe just opens the door or tries to and its closed
[2023-01-03 12:20:32] <%saugo> LULE
[2023-01-03 12:20:37] <%saugo> yeah..
[2023-01-03 12:20:55] <%+Moepsiii> well if its closed we shouldnt enter the room in the first place right?
[2023-01-03 12:21:00] <%saugo> but it happens, all this paranoia etc. the rough edges tend to even out eventually
[2023-01-03 12:21:03] <%+Moepsiii> yeah lets go somewhere else
[2023-01-03 12:21:17] <%+Moepsiii> you encounter another room with 2 doors!
[2023-01-03 12:21:43] <%+Moepsiii> naw
[2023-01-03 12:21:52] <%+Moepsiii> theyve been playing with me for now 1 year
[2023-01-03 12:22:02] <%+Moepsiii> a door is still the greatest mystery to them
[2023-01-03 12:22:27] <%saugo> LULW
[2023-01-03 12:22:44] <%saugo> mystery door I guess... peepoPonderingLife

[2023-01-03 12:24:37] <%+Moepsiii> they also masterfully dodged every single magical item reward
[2023-01-03 12:25:08] <%+Moepsiii> do we want to check that door out? me looking at the list of phat loot the group could get. No lets go the other way
[2023-01-03 12:25:22] <%+Moepsiii> NOOOO

[2023-01-03 12:31:55] <%+Moepsiii> @saugo yeah no that doesnt work either, they saved some imprisoned civilians from the city, the villagers told them go in that room they keep their good stuff there, the group was like naaah
[2023-01-03 12:33:21] <%saugo> well then they miss out
[2023-01-03 12:33:27] <%saugo> it happens too
[2023-01-03 12:34:10] <%saugo> just recycle the contents in some other treasure room or the like LULW they'll never know and saves you some work
[2023-01-03 12:38:10] <%+Moepsiii> naw its a giant dungeon
[2023-01-03 12:38:29] <%+Moepsiii> the content will stay there and if they miss it, sucks for them ElaLoser
[2023-01-03 12:39:58] <%+Moepsiii> and if they die i blame them for sucking and being unable to work as a team
[2023-01-03 12:40:45] <%saugo> Oh yeah it was a premade? no need for dm magic then

[2023-01-03 18:09:18] <HelenWTF> @Altoption Both combat and armor systems in KCD are such a clusterfuck ElaMeltdown Combat only works in duels, combo-reliant and clunky, all armor powercrept by milanese set in terms of armor per weight ratio, weapon tiers are meh at best, also lack of proper impact in combat until you drain the stamina

[2023-01-03 18:15:35] <HelenWTF> @Altoption It already is a freelock as it gets, they fixed target change from mousewheel to just dragging a mouse to another enemy FeelsRainMan Still, movement set just isnt designed to fight more than 1 guy, you just get rolled with awkward footwork, blocking and slow-mo into enemy riposte, if you think of running - you autolose LUL One of the reason i just went with mace+shield, its pointless to do combos until max Warfare
