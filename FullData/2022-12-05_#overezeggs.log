[2022-12-05 14:15:07] <%Weegleman> i got desensitised from using the word cunt from watching australian eft streamers LUL
[2022-12-05 14:15:17] <%ImKhaos_> Sometimes harsh is fine but usually they just say it like it’s poison on their tongue. They hate saying it

[2022-12-05 14:16:42] <%operatorviera> is a beer that is fucking gross
[2022-12-05 14:17:04] <%operatorviera> Carlton Dry is much better

[2022-12-05 14:17:28] <%operatorviera> VB is like white claw

[2022-12-05 14:18:55] <%ImKhaos_> My friends looked at me weird
[2022-12-05 14:18:58] <%operatorviera> If you come to Aus try Carlton Dry instead of VB or XXXX Gold
[2022-12-05 14:19:16] <%Dang_old_Dixie> Tbh I don't butter my toast either when I put cheese slices on there. But I do with vegimite
[2022-12-05 14:19:28] <%ImKhaos_> If you come to aus you need to have a good old fashioned aussie bbq
[2022-12-05 14:19:34] <%Dang_old_Dixie> Cause imho vegimite and butter is like one of them flavour combis that work
[2022-12-05 14:19:39] <%Dang_old_Dixie> Without the butter it's just yeast on bread
[2022-12-05 14:19:43] <%KillerF0x> i sometimes but toast on my butter
[2022-12-05 14:19:46] <%Weegleman> nothing wrong with a cheap beer if you're goin for the buzz

[2022-12-05 19:09:47] <%dorf11115> well the same with fall guys died kinda fast

[2022-12-05 19:11:34] <!%Touchthesky8> Among Us just didn't change. Fall Guys can make new challenges, but Among Us has stayed pretty much the same from day 1. Only change came from mods over time.

[2022-12-05 19:12:07] <%Nano_Wolves> I feel like the devs for Among Us just couldn't keep up with the amount of players that suddenly came into it.
[2022-12-05 19:12:13] <%GingerThoroughBread> Hmm by "suggestions channel" do you mean ideas-and-feedback? Or is there a different channel I'm not seeing
[2022-12-05 19:12:16] <%ImKhaos_> Like they prolonged the death with VC and then it went away
[2022-12-05 19:12:29] <!%Touchthesky8> Dealing with children on voice chat is likely insufferable as well
[2022-12-05 19:12:46] <%GingerThoroughBread> Hmm Do you want it in December-ideas?
[2022-12-05 19:12:49] <%TTourist> Did amogus officially get VC or just mods?
[2022-12-05 19:13:18] <%Nano_Wolves> Like. Among Us originally came out 2018 and didn't blow up til 2020. Before the sudden growth it had less than 100 players at any point I believe.

[2022-12-05 22:39:31] <%RatboyJon> @yelwar129 all depends on what you use. I use chinese black vinegar, some people use lemon juice, you could use rice vinegar... then theres the mustard, Dijon, yellow? honey? and then you can add other things... pepper? garlic? basically whatever you want.

[2022-12-05 22:39:48] <%yelwar129> i have heard of that soup before. im sure that the like contents have been like eaten and replaced frequently enough that nothing is like rotten in it or anything.

[2022-12-05 22:41:17] <%+Roadhead> they say the soup is removed every day, the giant 5 foot wide pot is cleaned, and then a portion of the leftover soup is added back to the pot to simmer overnight, to act as a base/stock for the next day's sou[
[2022-12-05 22:42:01] <%RatboyJon> @yelwar129 well, you'd have full control of the process... which is mostly measuring because you blend for like 30 seconds and it's done LUL
