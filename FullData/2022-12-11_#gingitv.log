[2022-12-11 10:19:16] <Kalatastz> first day is probably going to be all heroics anyway

[2022-12-11 10:50:10] <%hidingi> naughtykeystv Always depends on the balance of the game, but in general I agree. Like last season of shadowlands, not playing lock, surv or like ww, put you significantly behind from the ge tgo

[2022-12-11 10:50:43] <%hidingi> But as long as most specs are within a reasonable distance, tier-lists becomes rather useless
[2022-12-11 10:50:47] <%JuckFrump> @Epixil it depends on the players you are playing with... some people will struggle with weekly key +15 especially at the start of the expansion, like it's hard to do bad dps with some classes and very easy with others

[2022-12-11 10:53:22] <%hidingi> naughtykeystv I wish for the difference be mostly negligible when it comes to the balance of the specs. However in the last season of shadowlands, with lock and surv doing like double the dps of others, there were no doubt, that playing something different than those two specs, would be a disadvantage
