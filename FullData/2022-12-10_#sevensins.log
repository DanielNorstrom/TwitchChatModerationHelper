[2022-12-10 01:03:49] <ArchAngelaAERITH> SourPls
[2022-12-10 01:04:01] <Aragu> Really enjoying these runs, but I don't know what 'Natural Jobs Only' means in the context of Final Fantasy V. Is Seven only allowed to use 'native' abilities for any job he equips?
[2022-12-10 01:04:20] <@%RabidAmoeba> !natural
[2022-12-10 01:04:20] <@%^GilgamEXP> Natural jobs: https://i.imgur.com/ib1g3gB.png
[2022-12-10 01:05:02] <@%RabidAmoeba> Each character was only able to use their NATURAL elemental abilities
[2022-12-10 01:05:16] <Aragu> I see, thanks @rabidamoeba
[2022-12-10 01:05:25] <@%RabidAmoeba> Butts = Wind Crystal Jobs etc

[2022-12-10 01:06:34] <Aragu> Poor Galuf gets the early game short end of the stick, but Samurai + Chemist seems scary
[2022-12-10 01:07:15] <Aragu> @rabidamoeba thanks again

[2022-12-10 02:43:34] <@%RabidAmoeba> But in terms of the Fiesta .... Not until NEXT year!
[2022-12-10 02:44:29] <@%RabidAmoeba> Meaning it would be played at some point in during the Next years Fiesta in February 2024, MOST likely
[2022-12-10 02:46:45] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Lovely tributes to a great franchise
[2022-12-10 02:47:44] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I love their marathons
[2022-12-10 02:48:15] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> He streams so early my time now
[2022-12-10 02:49:03] <@%RabidAmoeba> I know what you mean @Demonic_Vortex_Oni . Even now I only really catch the tail ends of each day
[2022-12-10 02:49:32] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> bggCry

[2022-12-10 02:50:16] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> :)
[2022-12-10 02:51:03] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> What's the rainbow materia rule?
[2022-12-10 02:51:12] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> !fiesta

[2022-12-10 02:51:28] <@%RabidAmoeba> Each character can only equip one of EACH color materia
[2022-12-10 02:51:50] <+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Nice. That sounds like a fun run
[2022-12-10 02:51:51] <@%RabidAmoeba> Thus each character will have a 'rainbow'
[2022-12-10 02:52:14] <@%RabidAmoeba> wonder if we have that command live yet
[2022-12-10 02:52:18] <@%RabidAmoeba> !rainbow

[2022-12-10 03:27:06] <@%RabidAmoeba> Looks like you get to avoid those ads RERUN Seven has been mentioning @Demonic_Vortex_Oni
[2022-12-10 03:27:22] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> sevenKweh < I hope he never gets rid of this one lmao
[2022-12-10 03:27:35] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> :P
[2022-12-10 03:27:38] <@%RabidAmoeba> Not likely
[2022-12-10 03:28:08] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> sevenButt Wait, he brought this one back?
[2022-12-10 03:28:11] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I thought we lost that one

[2022-12-10 03:29:07] <chuppacheos> Oh wow
[2022-12-10 03:29:13] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> :)
[2022-12-10 03:29:16] <chuppacheos> ff13 too
[2022-12-10 03:29:28] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Every year, him and Bgg02 run the marathon
[2022-12-10 03:29:36] <@%RabidAmoeba> As you can see they're all listed right there @chuppacheos
[2022-12-10 03:29:37] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> With different perks to keep it interesting
[2022-12-10 03:29:57] <@%RabidAmoeba> There will even be more games if more incentives are met
[2022-12-10 03:30:32] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Is FF World a part of this years run? I haven't went through the incentives this year
[2022-12-10 03:30:54] <@%RabidAmoeba> We don't know what any of the BONUS incentives are as of yet
[2022-12-10 03:31:05] <@%RabidAmoeba> So it 'could' be
[2022-12-10 03:31:15] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Oh, awesome :) I'll just have to hope then and keep watching heh
[2022-12-10 03:31:28] <@%RabidAmoeba> WoFF is such a FUN game!
[2022-12-10 03:31:52] <chuppacheos> ive played it before the maxima upgrade
[2022-12-10 03:31:57] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I still have yet to play it. I almost bought it when Seven played it
[2022-12-10 03:32:05] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> :*( looks like so much fun though
[2022-12-10 03:32:09] <@%RabidAmoeba> Same @chuppacheos
[2022-12-10 03:34:20] <@%RabidAmoeba> BTW @chuppacheos when you drop a question during reruns, people might not be actively involved in the chat but if you hang out a while, you might get an answer sooner or later sevenLUL
[2022-12-10 03:34:22] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> List looks solid though. I still have yet to play through integrade as well. I'm slacking
[2022-12-10 03:35:37] <@%RabidAmoeba> You are not alone @Demonic_Vortex_Oni
[2022-12-10 03:35:45] <chuppacheos> I have a controversial observation. Would CalebHart look like SevenSins if time passed by 10-15 years?
[2022-12-10 03:36:50] <@%RabidAmoeba> @Demonic_Vortex_Oni I only play on PC and even then... I only buy games when they are on sale at a 'Pre-Determined Price'
[2022-12-10 03:37:24] <@%RabidAmoeba> And who knows @chuppacheos
[2022-12-10 03:37:27] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> No clue who that is chuppa.
[2022-12-10 03:38:07] <chuppacheos> @demonic_vortex_oni most well known og ff7 speedrunner
[2022-12-10 03:38:15] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Yeah, I waited until ff7 was released on steam before getting it.
[2022-12-10 03:38:24] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Oh, rock on
[2022-12-10 03:38:41] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Oh, actually I know who you're talking about. Ran across the stream a couple times
[2022-12-10 03:45:39] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I honestly wouldn't mind getting some more ff games in this throwback visual quality style
[2022-12-10 03:46:20] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Or something like dragon quest did :P I'd pay for both versions of the game
[2022-12-10 03:46:47] <@%RabidAmoeba> Sorry @Demonic_Vortex_Oni but I need to laugh at that term "Throwback Visual Style"
[2022-12-10 03:47:43] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> *remembers all rpgs of his youth, smiling broadly*
[2022-12-10 03:49:26] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> GunArmDyne I like that name :P
[2022-12-10 03:50:02] <@%RabidAmoeba> I mean the Pixel Remakes are just slightly/moderately upscaled recreations of the original versions. Being that I played all of these when they were originally released, and take offense to the term being used when these are just 'practically' the original games with some modifications. Nothing really 'Throwback Visual Style' like if it were a BRAND NEW game programmed in THIS style. Then I would accept the term.
[2022-12-10 03:50:31] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> :P
[2022-12-10 03:50:44] <@%RabidAmoeba> Right back @ ya ;p
[2022-12-10 03:52:08] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Throwback to the king days of top down/isometric rps with pixel animations. That's my home when it comes to rpgs, I miss the days when that was almost every rpg XD
[2022-12-10 03:52:22] <@%RabidAmoeba> When playing FF6PR I spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME on the Veldt just listening to this song on loop sevenKEK
[2022-12-10 03:52:49] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> It's a good track for sure
[2022-12-10 03:52:59] <@%RabidAmoeba> The SNES era really was GOLDEN AGE for us, right @Demonic_Vortex_Oni
[2022-12-10 03:53:25] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> The one track in FF I stopped and probably spent the most time listening to was hip hop de chocobo :P
[2022-12-10 03:54:14] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> mario rpg, earthbound, paladin's quest were 3 of my favs when I was young
[2022-12-10 03:54:55] <@%RabidAmoeba> Oh 💩 you played Paladins Quest too? I know almost NO ONE else who played that!
[2022-12-10 03:55:03] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I know :(
[2022-12-10 03:55:32] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I've been trying to get Finomenon to play it for ages now since he owns it. Still hasn't popped up yet
[2022-12-10 03:55:46] <@%RabidAmoeba> Maybe someday ...
[2022-12-10 03:56:16] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> lmao, looks like only if I donate for it hahahah. No one else hardly but like 1 person seemed to know what it was the couple times I brought it up XD
[2022-12-10 03:57:45] <@%RabidAmoeba> Yeah, definitely a rare one from the SNES. The NES equivalent I would say has to be "Ghost Lion" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Lion
[2022-12-10 03:58:25] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> closest thing I think I played to an rpg on nes was probably zelda for the longest
[2022-12-10 03:58:46] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I remember eventually playing zelda 2 and getting lost and fed up pretty quickly after that lmao
[2022-12-10 04:00:39] <@%XyPara> Math Man with 6 S1nners than kefka post game on that's determination ( ͡° ) MrDestructoid
[2022-12-10 04:00:53] <@%RabidAmoeba> Well Zelda 2 ... I still haven't played it w/o cheating since the first time I played/beat it when it came out. Love the music, but otherwise I have PTSD from the final portion of the game B4 the last palace. Even watching people go through that area now, triggers me
[2022-12-10 04:01:07] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I hated getting lost in Paladin's quest too lmao. Earthbound was one of those precious gems where getting lost was actually fun though. Spent so much time just going back through towns
[2022-12-10 04:01:29] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Yeah, Zelda 2 was a nightmare for a younger me lmao.
[2022-12-10 04:02:21] <@%RabidAmoeba> And of course back then we couldn't just sit down at a computer and pull up a FAQ for the games we were playing when "Lost" LUL
[2022-12-10 04:02:22] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> I watch the Streamer Grayskull83 play through it a lot lmao. I don't see how I could have ever completed that as a young kid XD
[2022-12-10 04:03:01] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> My family didn't believe in computers and phones. I didn't have a computer until I was like 18, moved out and got my own lmao
[2022-12-10 04:03:33] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> No phone to call people with one either lmao. Half hour walk to the library, multiple dollars to print off 100 pages for different games... fun times
[2022-12-10 04:04:22] <@%RabidAmoeba> sevenLUL
[2022-12-10 04:05:26] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> There was a few times when I saved up enough for a game guide ... but those were rare
[2022-12-10 04:07:37] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> All the know-it-all kids of the neighborhood that had computers or game guides and knew all the combos to mortal kombat smh They could all burn in Scorpions eternal hell fire when I finally figured it out
[2022-12-10 04:08:01] <@%RabidAmoeba> sevenKEK
[2022-12-10 04:08:47] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> Those were the library visits I walked with determination lol
[2022-12-10 04:09:22] <@%RabidAmoeba> with .... DETERMINATION! LOL
[2022-12-10 04:10:21] <%+Demonic_Vortex_Oni> sevenLUL

[2022-12-10 09:27:34] <%+agentgerbil> good morning

[2022-12-10 09:27:59] <%iktasentrosi> Enjoy your day off!!!
[2022-12-10 09:28:15] <~%SevenSins> thanks :D
[2022-12-10 09:28:20] <~%SevenSins> playing anno 1800 haha, super chill music
[2022-12-10 09:28:45] <~%SevenSins> i played anno 1404 when i was younger for like thousands of hours prolly, only just learned about anno 1800 last night
[2022-12-10 09:28:53] <%+PixelFlows> oh that's on sale right now, if it lasts until I get paid next friday I'm getting it
[2022-12-10 09:28:53] <iatepoptarts> @sevensins thank you for the fiesta!! Love watching this. Makes my day!
[2022-12-10 09:28:57] <~%SevenSins> it was released in 2019 but i had no idea it existed.. turns out they didn't have it on steam
[2022-12-10 09:29:03] <~%SevenSins> yeah they only put it back on steam yesterday
[2022-12-10 09:29:16] <~%SevenSins> thanks @iatepoptarts :D
[2022-12-10 09:29:17] <%+PixelFlows> yeah, it looks so chill and fun
[2022-12-10 09:29:42] <~%SevenSins> yeah it's the music for me
[2022-12-10 09:30:11] <~%SevenSins> dynamedion makes the music, for all annos, but they've only ever done this era in 1404, somehow 1800 has the same vibe/compositions for music, so it's almost like an updated soundtrack and it's oooo
[2022-12-10 09:30:19] <~%SevenSins> my brains melting listening to it lol
[2022-12-10 09:30:54] <%+PixelFlows> haha nice, I look forward to having a good brain melting time myself.
[2022-12-10 09:31:20] <~%SevenSins> i needed it, been playing games that're too exciting/too many triggers
[2022-12-10 09:31:42] <%+PixelFlows> I feel that, Winter for me calls for more chill and relaxing games.
[2022-12-10 09:31:54] <%+agentgerbil> oh wow it has denuvo
[2022-12-10 09:32:00] <Splash__Woman> i'm kinda sad that Ubisoft is having a thumb up their ass with most of them quickly cutting the online when a new one is coming out
[2022-12-10 09:32:25] <Splash__Woman> Anno has been a fun series to watch and play
[2022-12-10 09:35:10] <Splash__Woman> moar
[2022-12-10 09:35:59] <%+PixelFlows> it's multi?
[2022-12-10 09:37:21] <Splash__Woman> it feels like every FFF just progressively gets faster and faster; remembering things
[2022-12-10 09:38:09] <%+PixelFlows> nothing wrong with that, means we can stuff more mainline games in when they come out sevenKEK
[2022-12-10 09:38:59] <Splash__Woman> even better with all these challenges; figuring how to do it all over again.
[2022-12-10 09:40:00] <Blackwolff23sLair> Final Fantasy XVI was announced I heard is it rumor or true?
[2022-12-10 09:40:20] <%+PixelFlows> yup, release date is next year like...June?
[2022-12-10 09:40:26] <Splash__Woman> FF16 will be a thing; yes
[2022-12-10 09:41:49] <%+PixelFlows> I'm hoping for a 2024 release for FF7R Pt.2
[2022-12-10 09:41:56] <Blackwolff23sLair> I can't wait I love final fantasy
[2022-12-10 09:42:41] <~%SevenSins> @agentgerbil it has the stupid ubisoft program to play it too
[2022-12-10 09:42:47] <~%SevenSins> but w/e i'm happy i can play lol
[2022-12-10 09:43:01] <%+bizkit413> as of now, the most recent info we have for ff7 rebirth says winter 2023
[2022-12-10 09:43:03] <Splash__Woman> grumble grumble.
[2022-12-10 09:43:10] <~%SevenSins> ffxvi is 22 june yea
[2022-12-10 09:43:16] <~%SevenSins> pretty exciteballs
[2022-12-10 09:43:21] <%+PixelFlows> Ubisoft is dropping their launcher apparently sometime? so it'll all be via steam.
[2022-12-10 09:43:28] <~%SevenSins> fingers crossed
[2022-12-10 09:43:29] <~%SevenSins> oh oh
[2022-12-10 09:43:33] <~%SevenSins> 1800 is coming to PS5 lol
[2022-12-10 09:43:39] <~%SevenSins> like in a year+ or smt
[2022-12-10 09:43:47] <~%SevenSins> idk how to play it with a controller but hey
[2022-12-10 09:43:48] <%+PixelFlows> if only I could afford/find a PS5 sevenKEK
[2022-12-10 09:43:56] <~%SevenSins> i'm more worried about the controller part lol
[2022-12-10 09:44:04] <%+PixelFlows> it's actually not too bad
[2022-12-10 09:44:18] <~%SevenSins> they've still not made it supportable sadly
[2022-12-10 09:44:21] <%+PixelFlows> I've played RTS games with controllers on the original playstation haha
[2022-12-10 09:44:28] <~%SevenSins> there's a beta somewhere, but it ended apparently
[2022-12-10 09:44:29] <Splash__Woman> honestly i've played C&C 3 with a controller. surprisingly not that bad
[2022-12-10 09:44:35] <~%SevenSins> well yeah but ubisoft + rts + controller idk
[2022-12-10 09:44:51] <~%SevenSins> they couldn't even get controllers right for AC back in the day
[2022-12-10 09:45:06] <Splash__Woman> i still can't get used to AC1
[2022-12-10 09:45:11] <%+PixelFlows> yeah...they better get a team who know controllers to set up that build, last thing they need is a poorly ported controller layout
[2022-12-10 09:45:30] <~%SevenSins> yea
[2022-12-10 09:45:31] <%+PixelFlows> AC?
[2022-12-10 09:45:39] <Splash__Woman> assassins creed
[2022-12-10 09:45:42] <~%SevenSins> ^
[2022-12-10 09:45:58] <%+PixelFlows> ah yeah, it was booty....I thought you meant armored core sevenFail
[2022-12-10 09:46:07] <Splash__Woman> i know Armored Core could be another, but Ubisoft after all loves to stub their toe and run away.
[2022-12-10 09:46:19] <Splash__Woman> hah LUL
[2022-12-10 09:46:34] <%+PixelFlows> I'm sooooo damn hyped for ACore6

[2022-12-10 09:46:49] <%Splash__Woman> "oh the game is two years old? Let's cut the online!"
[2022-12-10 09:46:49] <~%SevenSins> thought it failed permanently

[2022-12-10 09:47:59] <~%SevenSins> you too \o/
[2022-12-10 09:48:29] <%Splash__Woman> another thing i'm surprised for is Age of Empires 2 is coming to consoles
[2022-12-10 09:48:40] <%Splash__Woman> er;
[2022-12-10 09:48:42] <%Splash__Woman> xbox
[2022-12-10 09:48:43] <%+PixelFlows> Are you serious?! I adore that game!
[2022-12-10 09:49:45] <%Splash__Woman> i've got all the DLC's for the HD version; and i plan to with the Enhanced edition because two and one are memorable games
[2022-12-10 09:49:49] <%+PixelFlows> A real shame I'm terrible at it sevenDead
[2022-12-10 09:50:01] <~%SevenSins> oh wow really?
[2022-12-10 09:50:08] <~%SevenSins> i never played an AOE. idk why
[2022-12-10 09:50:10] <~%SevenSins> didn't own it
[2022-12-10 09:50:38] <%Splash__Woman> hah; same. i'm not very good at RTS; but with my turtle/economy strat i eventually come out on top; if the AI doesn't rush me anyway
[2022-12-10 09:50:40] <%+PixelFlows> it was really fun back in the day, had a very powerful custom game maker too
[2022-12-10 09:50:48] <%Splash__Woman> I also used to play Rise of Nations
[2022-12-10 09:50:50] <%Splash__Woman> that was a gem
[2022-12-10 09:51:11] <%+PixelFlows> another gem I miss is Empire Earth, would love a remake or remaster
[2022-12-10 09:51:14] <%Splash__Woman> i still have it; but my Winows 7 computer is now a potato that can't run much
[2022-12-10 09:51:15] <~%SevenSins> @Splash__Woman that's why i love anno lol, just turn your enemies into allies and no worries about fighting
[2022-12-10 09:51:54] <%+PixelFlows> You can absolutely make enemies into allies in AoE2 if you have what they want lol
[2022-12-10 09:51:59] <~%SevenSins> oh niiice
[2022-12-10 09:52:30] <~%SevenSins> fkn ubisoft needs 2fa to play the damn game on my computer wtf
[2022-12-10 09:52:37] <~%SevenSins> hope they drop taht launcher crap soon then
[2022-12-10 09:52:39] <%Splash__Woman> @Splash__Woman the great thing about AoE2 is that like Starcraft 2's custom maps that people can make, Age of empires 2 has it too; and that game is like Starcraft 1 levels of old, ... which i think AoE 1 is older then starcraft 1 now that i think about it
[2022-12-10 09:52:59] <%Splash__Woman> the launcher stuff was a mistake.
[2022-12-10 09:53:16] <~%SevenSins> yea everyone tried to run their own sotre like steam, but they were all too late
[2022-12-10 09:53:16] <%Splash__Woman> corpo's trying to jump on the Steam-like bandwagon
[2022-12-10 09:53:20] <%+PixelFlows> yeah I believe it is older.
[2022-12-10 09:53:20] <~%SevenSins> steam was a piece of crap on release too haha
[2022-12-10 09:53:24] <%Splash__Woman> shame to them; they're WAAAAAY too late on that
[2022-12-10 09:53:34] <%Splash__Woman> yeah people HATED Steam
[2022-12-10 09:53:42] <%Splash__Woman> now it's beloved by just about everyone
[2022-12-10 09:53:50] <%+PixelFlows> Steam learned over time though and cleaned their shit up pretty well
[2022-12-10 09:54:03] <~%SevenSins> yep
[2022-12-10 09:54:09] <~%SevenSins> i was there since the start, getting my 20 year badge next year
[2022-12-10 09:54:51] <%Splash__Woman> i only got mine thanks to one of my uncles having Half-life 1; and the Orange box for the PC
[2022-12-10 09:55:06] <%Splash__Woman> and the half-life expansions made by GearBox of all people
[2022-12-10 09:55:12] <%+PixelFlows> very nice! I lost my original account otherwise I'd have 16-17 years rather than 12 years
[2022-12-10 09:55:25] <%Splash__Woman> i think mines 11-13 years
[2022-12-10 09:55:33] <%Splash__Woman> or yeah i'd have had one a long time ago too
[2022-12-10 09:56:30] <%Splash__Woman> i felt stupid cuse i never seen an online launcher like that until the whole bit of finding the launcher online
[2022-12-10 09:56:39] <@%XyPara> oh god! Can you can find the AAAAAAAAAA one playthrough.: `` We'll not around, is almost never heard the good. MrDestructoid
[2022-12-10 10:00:12] <~%SevenSins> it's funny how annoying it used to be, but back then our launcher was windows desktop icons
[2022-12-10 10:00:35] <~%SevenSins> steam trying to make things easier wasn't received well but ever since the cloud saving it redeemed itself
[2022-12-10 10:00:48] <~%SevenSins> well that and being able to get patches from one place
[2022-12-10 10:01:12] <%Splash__Woman> YEAA--- no...
[2022-12-10 10:01:15] <%Splash__Woman> hahaha
[2022-12-10 10:02:03] <%+PixelFlows> oh god the patching updates were heavenly
[2022-12-10 10:02:40] <%Splash__Woman> Cloud saves are the best; helped me keep my data on the fallout games i have
[2022-12-10 10:03:38] <%+PixelFlows> there are still some demonic games that don't support cloud saves...
[2022-12-10 10:04:27] <%Splash__Woman> speaking of old classics; i still have Starwars Galactic battlegrounds as well

[2022-12-10 10:06:57] <%+PixelFlows> @Splash__Woman SW GBG was great, I also picked that up
[2022-12-10 10:08:25] <%Splash__Woman> it really is; what's cool about that is that the new AoE 2 devs brought that one civilization that you can put animals in your foodmills and create food per second just like GB
[2022-12-10 10:08:32] <%Splash__Woman> was neat to see
[2022-12-10 10:10:02] <%+PixelFlows> I loved that concept, I'm glad they reused it in AoE2
[2022-12-10 10:11:50] <%Splash__Woman> and not to mention the different types of herdables
[2022-12-10 10:12:05] <%Splash__Woman> like the banthas; there's cows
[2022-12-10 10:12:25] <%Splash__Woman> and whatever land specific herdable that could be in said map
