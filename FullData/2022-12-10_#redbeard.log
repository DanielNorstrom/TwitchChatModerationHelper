[2022-12-10 08:40:40] <%$SFWildBill> Properly kept, they are interesting and beautiful fish, but they have a few special needs, and caring for them long term requires true commitment. Piranhas are banned as pets in many areas, particularly in the southern United States, so check local regulations before purchasing them, especially online.

[2022-12-10 08:42:34] <GayEagleDima> people also didnt like desert spear at first but it turned out to be great
[2022-12-10 08:42:40] <rudyshtev> wins against DK using a different class should give you a 2x win
[2022-12-10 08:42:42] <UncleAlcoholic> dead or alive you're coming with me
[2022-12-10 08:43:08] <+petiteparakeet> @rudyshtev Yeah, hopefully make some changes soon. DKs just have such strong class cards
[2022-12-10 08:43:10] <UncleAlcoholic> sorry I'm watching Robocop
[2022-12-10 08:43:10] <@%gesticulate> 'died after last turn' means an undead died in your opponent's most recent turn or your current turn

[2022-12-10 08:57:03] <%+draculaic2> you have three slots and you have to fill up red green or blue runes to limit your card pool
[2022-12-10 08:57:07] <@%gesticulate> death knights have a rune system that limits the class cards that you can put in a single deck

[2022-12-10 10:36:43] <!%paprika_cayenne> I think the hardest thing is all the dk cards trade up. A 1 mana 2/2 weapon that also does 2 damage to enemy hero. All the current class cards don‚Äôt trade up like that.

[2022-12-10 11:34:49] <%+massanviewbot6969> They almost have to, death knight feels really strong so they‚Äôre going to have to do something

[2022-12-10 11:36:28] <%SilasPositioning> yeah the rune system is a neat progression from spell schools, or reinterpretation of MTG colors
[2022-12-10 11:36:37] <%dinklejam> priest shadow, holy, and ??
[2022-12-10 11:36:48] <%$Impbloody> I think honestly the biggest difference is class cards are offered for death knight and they feel impactful, most classes have bad cards so you end up with a pile of stats
[2022-12-10 11:36:56] <%+TennisDamo> I think it might not seem good in constructed because  it's a new class /concept and the stats will creep up over time
[2022-12-10 11:37:00] <petrosman> it's actually funny that a new class is more fun and better to play in a draft format instead of constructed, team5 really screwed up the balance here

[2022-12-10 11:37:34] <%+Klingzilla> discipline for priest, how that would be in HS im not sure
[2022-12-10 11:37:44] <KentuckyFriedKodo> not everything needs to be the same though. part of the reason i stopped playing wow was because all classes could do everything. keeping mechanics unique to different classes is a good thing, not smth to be fixed
[2022-12-10 11:37:48] <VikingJackAU> I just bit the bullet and crafted the druid deck. First opponent was DK and I theo his Patchwerk, he conceded and sent me a friend request KEKW
[2022-12-10 11:38:03] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> It's really just miracle rogue that's destroying for rogue rn
[2022-12-10 11:38:11] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> They gave it so much support in this new set
[2022-12-10 11:38:15] <%SilasPositioning> I went to 4 pinball tournaments in the last 8 days and won 3 of them! didn't go out much this year, and my late campaign to qualify for state champs is going swimmingly

[2022-12-10 11:38:35] <%dinklejam> apparently "discipline " is the other type of priest
[2022-12-10 11:39:02] <xxnighteyesxx> a rune system for a class like mage might kill some cards that relay on synergy for diff types of spells. im sure other classes have similar problems. im not saying it cant or shouldnt be done, only that it will be really hard.
[2022-12-10 11:39:02] <+deadheroseven> Pinball so excite
[2022-12-10 11:39:20] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> I think it's still good but it seems with this new expansion they gave miracle a lot of support
[2022-12-10 11:39:29] <KentuckyFriedKodo> i'm saying it shouldnt be done
[2022-12-10 11:39:39] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> That copy a spell legendary spell and the 1 mana ping plus draw a card are nuts for it
[2022-12-10 11:39:58] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> And they added the concoction cards and those seems op lol

[2022-12-10 12:14:06] <%+JeromeA2> incredible, you can really tell how the artists *might* have used Dreads as a reference point
[2022-12-10 12:14:12] <EranRefael> after i did some research my suggestion for DK is 1 red, and 2 green runes. second place would be 1 from each. but Dragon paladin is the best of all deck right now

[2022-12-10 12:16:38] <%immoniakki> I think frost strike alone makes an argument for getting at least one frost. discovering another frost card so easily is so powerful since the pool is very small and the cards so powerful

[2022-12-10 12:57:40] <%lordoy0> why is DK so strong in Arena? is it about the quality of the cards or the fact that the rune system introduces synergy that other classes are lacking?

[2022-12-10 13:45:39] <varklen> @RedBeard Signature maps look cool as gallery, but not for gameplay.

[2022-12-10 13:45:49] <%netero883> If you could dust signatures there would be zero problems. I'd actually accept getting zero dust for them, I just want the ability to get their ugly assess out of my collection manager while scrolling

[2022-12-10 13:56:35] <+FunKaliTy> Yeah when I think about it I'm also leaning towards blink fox, it is surely better than the cutthroat ;)
[2022-12-10 13:56:45] <%+Danielw1e> both fox and weapon are quite good, if i were to choose I would go for the weapon since you have bigger chances to get uncommon cards than rares
