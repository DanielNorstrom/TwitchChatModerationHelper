[2023-01-05 10:52:14] <%$fatcowjay> Cheer200 I am coming back from my 69s ban, and I want to say that I think it was bullshit. Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, which happened to bring a laugh or a smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. Anyway, I'm glad to be back
