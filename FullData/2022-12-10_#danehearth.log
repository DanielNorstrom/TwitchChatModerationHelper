[2022-12-10 18:54:49] <%UmbraDeath> 2nd guff - 40 mana crystals Kappa
[2022-12-10 18:54:59] <%+H1REDGOON> I'm just happy to beat those locks
[2022-12-10 18:55:12] <@%Duje200> i had like mulitple ways to win denathrius before the stelth nerf alastor etc
[2022-12-10 18:55:34] <@%Duje200> it was like a dragon version
[2022-12-10 18:55:39] <@%Duje200> updated with new cards
[2022-12-10 18:55:45] <dkaspersky> yeah its so dumb, people calling in for the nerfs in the first week of the expansion
[2022-12-10 18:55:47] <shoopi12> @Duje200 what stealth nerf
[2022-12-10 18:55:49] [Notification] Nickypoo99 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months!
[2022-12-10 18:55:58] <@%Duje200> @shoopi12 denathrius got nerfed
[2022-12-10 18:56:04] <%UmbraDeath> 16 mana just like that EZ Clap
[2022-12-10 18:56:13] <shoopi12> ah thats not stealth nerf its a nerf
[2022-12-10 18:56:40] <@%Duje200> yeah but nobody knew about it
[2022-12-10 18:56:51] <@%Duje200> only like 30 mins before they annouced it
[2022-12-10 18:56:55] <%+H1REDGOON> Dane! you watching the England match later or are you not a fan of the footy
[2022-12-10 18:56:58] <+mattmanw2> What about unnerfing?
[2022-12-10 18:57:09] <some_marw> wild is fucked anyways
[2022-12-10 18:57:23] <briarliar1> i feel bad for this pirate rogue knowing theyre about to be hit by spreading plague
[2022-12-10 18:57:23] <dongermancometh> wild is no mans land for balance
[2022-12-10 18:57:47] <Mawsy_> it hard to enjoy the new cards when 50% of my games is warlock
[2022-12-10 18:57:56] <DameNightmare> discardlock is using 2 new cards Kappa
[2022-12-10 18:58:04] <%UmbraDeath> give them all attack and we good EZ
[2022-12-10 18:58:22] <briarliar1> im pretty sure a hearthstone dev responded to a tweet about wild so maybe theyre doing something about discolock
[2022-12-10 18:58:25] <some_marw> this problem is not exclusive to HS either. legacy in magic is basically the same. just fucked at this point
[2022-12-10 18:58:28] <DameNightmare> there is no building around warlock
[2022-12-10 18:58:30] <stayinmytrapm8> i think this lock is healthy for those shitters in the meta
[2022-12-10 18:58:31] <+mattmanw2> What you guys are all underestimating is just how much Dane hates secret mage
[2022-12-10 18:58:32] <%+d4nnym4c> I love it when I'm seeing the same deck over and over, just have to find the counter
[2022-12-10 18:59:01] <shoopi12> lol most people hated it
[2022-12-10 18:59:03] <shoopi12> i think
[2022-12-10 18:59:03] <dongermancometh> quest is still banned in wild right?
[2022-12-10 18:59:05] <Dannyvinicius> demon seed meta was satisfying
[2022-12-10 18:59:22] <%UmbraDeath> yeah
[2022-12-10 18:59:29] <briarliar1> ***
[2022-12-10 18:59:30] <some_marw> mind render was a problem in standard
[2022-12-10 18:59:37] <DameNightmare> demon seed wasnt breaindead op like discard
[2022-12-10 18:59:48] <shoopi12> only old shitty decks allowed KEKW
[2022-12-10 18:59:48] <some_marw> @DameNightmare it was tho
[2022-12-10 18:59:49] <vectors_tv> Discard is finally top meta
[2022-12-10 18:59:54] <Mawsy_> @DameNightmare no it was much more op
[2022-12-10 18:59:55] <stayinmytrapm8> discard aint op compared to demon seed meta
[2022-12-10 18:59:57] <dkaspersky> i dont care what people think, i liked demon seed, it was fun as fuck
[2022-12-10 19:00:22] <DameNightmare> hmmm i must have not been playing much when thet was active then
[2022-12-10 19:00:26] <@^Nightbot> Check out latest YouTube video: Mayor Noggen Coming From De Other Side - https://youtu.be/9Kwvd09D1nw
[2022-12-10 19:00:30] <Dannyvinicius> the only degenerate shit back in demon seed was rod at 3 mana LUL
[2022-12-10 19:00:34] <Sgorgo276> I hope they’re gonna unban or make good changes for seed questline, illucia and other cards
[2022-12-10 19:00:39] <DameNightmare> i cant imagine anything dumbber than discard lock'
[2022-12-10 19:00:56] <DameNightmare> even secret mage doesnt compare to me
[2022-12-10 19:00:59] <+mattmanw2> Didn’t gloop seeds win that turn?
[2022-12-10 19:01:00] <stayinmytrapm8> quest dh
[2022-12-10 19:01:02] <stayinmytrapm8> was beating lock
[2022-12-10 19:01:06] <stayinmytrapm8> glide
[2022-12-10 19:01:07] <bigdgamerboi> TPFufun Ey Hello Dane I just watched yesterday's vod SeemsGood

[2022-12-10 19:01:09] <bigdgamerboi> also hi chat.
[2022-12-10 19:01:17] <StubbornRadish> EZ Clap
[2022-12-10 19:01:22] <shoopi12> remember when questline druid was playable
[2022-12-10 19:01:28] <luLumpenN> heal big rogue
[2022-12-10 19:01:33] <%UmbraDeath> @bigdgamerboi daneJamming
[2022-12-10 19:01:35] <Plebber> diamond rank 3-5 rn and honestly don't see that many discard locks
[2022-12-10 19:01:45] <+mattmanw2> Have they never printed an anti-discard hate card?
[2022-12-10 19:01:53] <shoopi12> @Plebber they are already D1 / legend
[2022-12-10 19:01:54] <scdhruv> @shoopi12 Considering so many aggro decks, it may still be playable !
[2022-12-10 19:01:58] <some_marw> quest mage can also beat it. ice block is a power house
[2022-12-10 19:02:02] <bigdgamerboi> HeyGuys umbra
[2022-12-10 19:02:04] <briarliar1> pillager is a really difficult deck to play just to be an anti disco deck
[2022-12-10 19:02:09] <Dannyvinicius> the tech agaisnt discard lock is ashen elemental
[2022-12-10 19:02:18] <briarliar1> ^
[2022-12-10 19:02:21] <bigdgamerboi> What happened with the big Bone zone Mayor Shaman deck ?
[2022-12-10 19:02:24] <shoopi12> pillager isnt that hard.. just use a calculator Kappa
[2022-12-10 19:02:26] <bigdgamerboi> LUL
[2022-12-10 19:02:28] <%UmbraDeath> discard lock destroyed our last meta.....that's what matters! Kreygasm
[2022-12-10 19:02:30] <+DontRead_0> As a warlock I get really countered by quest mage with four iceblock by turn 7
[2022-12-10 19:02:31] <briarliar1> run ashen element in your discard warlock for the mirror matchup
[2022-12-10 19:02:46] <DameNightmare> ashen doesnt stop cataclysm
[2022-12-10 19:02:59] <Dannyvinicius> he doesnt need to be up
[2022-12-10 19:03:00] <Mawsy_> idk if you can outarmor them just plaiyhng some oaken defensive druid
[2022-12-10 19:03:03] <shoopi12> i just want to play my bad homemade deck and win
[2022-12-10 19:03:08] <some_marw> @DameNightmare if they have hands of guldan it does
[2022-12-10 19:03:15] <%UmbraDeath> @DameNightmare it's a battlecry for the entire turn
[2022-12-10 19:03:23] <$SpykoNukov> isn't discolock too fast for pillager ? like you can't remove tiny knight of evil
[2022-12-10 19:03:38] <briarliar1> pillager has evasion and stealth
[2022-12-10 19:03:39] <briarliar1> to survive
[2022-12-10 19:04:23] <shoopi12> stealth isnt good vs discolock
[2022-12-10 19:04:38] <DameNightmare> clownfish so balnced Kappa
[2022-12-10 19:04:52] <shoopi12> this is the new aggro murloc shaman
[2022-12-10 19:04:52] <stayinmytrapm8> just put double plague in druid against lock
[2022-12-10 19:04:54] <stayinmytrapm8> you win always
[2022-12-10 19:05:07] <%UmbraDeath> next turn gloop and onyxia and flipper friends EZ
[2022-12-10 19:05:11] <some_marw> i feel like the people ccomplaining about disco lock haven't played it and don't really know how it functions. it's not as braindead as it seems. strong yes but not unbearable
[2022-12-10 19:05:31] <DameNightmare> @some_marw youre full of it
[2022-12-10 19:05:39] <some_marw> @DameNightmare thanks
[2022-12-10 19:06:14] <$SpykoNukov> it's pretty much tier 0, I wouldn't say it's fine power wise
[2022-12-10 19:06:44] <briarliar1> no rotgill value sad

[2022-12-10 19:10:02] <Dannyvinicius> queues a warlock immediately LUL
[2022-12-10 19:10:02] <shopherodobrasil> deathrattle rogue can answer aswell
[2022-12-10 19:10:21] <Mawsy_> maybe some cthun druid like deck could be good
[2022-12-10 19:10:29] <Mawsy_> with oaken

[2022-12-10 20:01:13] <%$BaronVonLame> EZ
[2022-12-10 20:01:13] <!Dunkoura> no just deathrattle murlock with buffs

[2022-12-10 20:01:37] <%go1dim> HeyGuys
[2022-12-10 20:01:58] <!Dunkoura> dane couldn't you make a token deck with the 3 dmg to enemies and then the 5 mana clear board thingy?
[2022-12-10 20:02:11] <!Dunkoura> the lightning storm?
[2022-12-10 20:02:39] <!Dunkoura> so its an otk
[2022-12-10 20:02:49] <!Dunkoura> like 1/1 and then clear your board
[2022-12-10 20:03:03] <!%ApacheCox> why do you have fist in the deck ?
[2022-12-10 20:03:45] <%+dumbgamerboy> 🚀
[2022-12-10 20:03:56] <yoavsnake> if you haven't done it once, then it's probably crap - my sex life
[2022-12-10 20:04:07] <+Laggiter97> even dk sound really bad
[2022-12-10 20:04:16] <betamaxhipster> Wait, can Umbra even trigger in this deck?
[2022-12-10 20:04:27] <TwistedTeaspoon> umbra doesn't work if you give something death rattle right? only if you pay something with death rattle?
[2022-12-10 20:04:48] <%+PrimoBrand> yes
[2022-12-10 20:04:52] <+Laggiter97> or summon something with deathrattle
[2022-12-10 20:04:53] <%+dumbgamerboy> umbra triggers deathrattles as they enter play
[2022-12-10 20:05:13] <%+PrimoBrand> umbra is after you summon a deathrattle minion
[2022-12-10 20:05:20] <%+dumbgamerboy> correct
[2022-12-10 20:05:24] <%+PrimoBrand> so giving it dr does not work
[2022-12-10 20:05:50] <OurYoungHero> Any thoughts on adding Hungry Crab for the mirror? :)

[2022-12-10 20:09:11] <+Laggiter97> there are no deathrattle minions in deck though
[2022-12-10 20:09:18] <%$grognardish> Is Denathrius dead now, or just a 'sometimes include'?
[2022-12-10 20:09:32] <%+dumbgamerboy> you can slap baron geddon in instead LUL
[2022-12-10 20:09:49] <%+dumbgamerboy> rivendare, not geddon
[2022-12-10 20:10:01] <%+dumbgamerboy> too many barons
[2022-12-10 20:10:21] <betamaxhipster> Maybe Umbra could be an include if the infectious ghoul ends up being worth it, but that feels too slow, and trying to combo that feels way too cute
[2022-12-10 20:10:23] <!%ApacheCox> what overload cards are in the deck
[2022-12-10 20:10:32] <stream_guy12> what are some good hunter decks to push to legend and play?
[2022-12-10 20:10:48] <+Laggiter97> infectious ghoul is just a worse dinomancer
[2022-12-10 20:11:13] <ichoosedeath4> Hello Dane i missed you lad!
[2022-12-10 20:11:35] <%Dijoxin> evening lads and ladettes
[2022-12-10 20:11:38] <%+PrimoBrand> denatrius still good on druid, might be good on beast hunter if that still a thing and death knights. paladin could use it as a heal/treat @grognardish
[2022-12-10 20:11:50] <OurYoungHero> maybe he has both in hand kik
[2022-12-10 20:11:57] <stream_guy12> how about shock hunter? is that still good
[2022-12-10 20:12:11] <%+PrimoBrand> maybe has a niche use in implock as well, but it might be too slow now
[2022-12-10 20:12:21] <%$grognardish> @PrimoBrand ty
[2022-12-10 20:12:53] <%+PrimoBrand> good, yes. not as busted as it was @stream_guy12
[2022-12-10 20:12:53] <betamaxhipster> Danny will always serve a roll of keeping control in check, even if he's not ever actually played.
[2022-12-10 20:12:56] <%+dumbgamerboy> 3 mana 3/3 its voer
[2022-12-10 20:13:00] <%+dumbgamerboy> over
[2022-12-10 20:13:12] <stream_guy12> if someone could link me to beast hunter deck beast one plz?
[2022-12-10 20:13:20] <%+PrimoBrand> harder to play brann with 3 spitters, so it slows down a bit
[2022-12-10 20:14:08] <Zomgitsbacon> HUH!?!
[2022-12-10 20:14:08] <%+dumbgamerboy> goodbye quest

[2022-12-10 20:14:34] <SolidusA> card that gives deathrattle spawn 1/1 murlock against cataclysm
[2022-12-10 20:15:00] <betamaxhipster> There's also the new one that spawns 3/2s
[2022-12-10 20:15:04] <%+dumbgamerboy> cut umbra
[2022-12-10 20:15:06] <%+PrimoBrand> he plays the quest so that he doesn't burn a good card away... wich makes the deck worse cuz discarding such cards is what you really want LUL
[2022-12-10 20:15:54] <%$ToaTawlee> do you ever want mutanus to go with scargil?
[2022-12-10 20:15:58] <ichoosedeath4> I haven’t played for five months and the game has gone insane

[2022-12-10 20:20:39] <!Dunkoura> +50 oh yea!
[2022-12-10 20:20:45] <betamaxhipster> With zero healing, I don't see this deck ever shaping up against disco. So no bad feelings about the loss.
[2022-12-10 20:20:48] <!Dunkoura> why do i feel so bad only having 81k points :/
[2022-12-10 20:21:02] <ichoosedeath4> This discolock is total bullshit
[2022-12-10 20:21:15] <ichoosedeath4> Seems very unhealthy
[2022-12-10 20:21:16] <betamaxhipster> I can't be mad at disco finally being good after a thousand years.
[2022-12-10 20:21:32] <betamaxhipster> it was my pet deck back when i played
[2022-12-10 20:23:16] <OurYoungHero> I feel like the only thing you play against is Discard Warlock.
[2022-12-10 20:23:36] <!Dunkoura> if he doesn't clea he's dead no?
[2022-12-10 20:23:41] <%Dijoxin> @OurYoungHero and blood dk
[2022-12-10 20:23:42] <%$ToaTawlee> discard lock feels like a discard marvel snap deck now

[2022-12-10 20:41:47] <bigdgamerboi> Emperor Jebaited
[2022-12-10 20:44:00] <OurYoungHero> lmao concede time
[2022-12-10 20:45:40] <+Thcrapth> c'thun taking the game back tomorrow a simpler time
[2022-12-10 20:47:32] <bloodbrawler> Glad they are nerfing sire about damn time tbh, shouldve done it b4 xpec release.
[2022-12-10 20:48:08] <Zomgitsbacon> It should since its still there turn
[2022-12-10 20:48:45] <$SpykoNukov> boar ? c'thun ? defuq did I stumble into ? LUL
[2022-12-10 20:50:23] <OurYoungHero> Both win conditions in hand at least
[2022-12-10 20:51:07] <some_marw> maybe lorthremar or whatever he is called could work with lpg?
[2022-12-10 20:51:22] <yoavsnake> i see lorthemar but no shudderwock?
[2022-12-10 20:53:35] <OurYoungHero> I think Finley would be good to add
[2022-12-10 20:53:54] <betamaxhipster> finley disrupts the ice fishing package tho
[2022-12-10 20:54:29] <yoavsnake> r we buffing the macaws? 😭
[2022-12-10 20:55:09] <betamaxhipster> the macaws will be, what 12/12, 48/48, 192/192?
[2022-12-10 20:55:36] <Zomgitsbacon> Game is not favoring you this time unsHAHA
[2022-12-10 20:55:42] <bloodbrawler> what is the combo?
[2022-12-10 20:55:51] <+boolean3> no shudderwork
[2022-12-10 20:55:53] <+boolean3> wock
[2022-12-10 20:56:19] <umjev> the combo is to repeat the loremaster battlecry
[2022-12-10 20:56:21] <shopherodobrasil> you need some discount
[2022-12-10 20:56:21] <umjev> a bunch
[2022-12-10 20:56:22] <betamaxhipster> there are a million ways to win with shudderwock, this would be one of the slower ones
[2022-12-10 20:56:27] <neooffs> so you get 6 12/12 boars?
[2022-12-10 20:56:27] <yoavsnake> could work with druid tbh
[2022-12-10 20:56:41] <yoavsnake> shaman is more fun tho
[2022-12-10 20:57:59] <zantomun> got my lich king cardback. game uninstalled lmao

[2022-12-10 21:01:50] <OurYoungHero> @Fried04 Same game
[2022-12-10 21:01:54] <dumbgamerboy> they should just remove neptulon colossal tag and make it a battlecry to summon the hands
[2022-12-10 21:01:57] <+dumbgamerboy> tired of it
[2022-12-10 21:02:12] <zantomun> i do mailbox dancer instead of gavel
[2022-12-10 21:02:34] <Fried04> maybe add tag to nept that when hes on board the hands cant also attack

[2022-12-10 21:16:45] <briarliar1> drinky drinky
[2022-12-10 21:16:48] <zantomun> concotions are really satisfying to play but need the alchemists for it to be worth the tempo
[2022-12-10 21:17:27] <%NewCristiako> Shadow
[2022-12-10 21:17:34] <briarliar1> @zantomun i think alot of concoctions are just worth the 3 mana
[2022-12-10 21:17:58] <zantomun> shark?
[2022-12-10 21:20:21] <zantomun> yeah

[2022-12-10 21:23:34] <zantomun> lol the flavor text
[2022-12-10 21:23:42] <fjagamer2> PepoCheer
[2022-12-10 21:26:17] <zantomun> disenchant button prioritizes your standard cards over golden i think
[2022-12-10 21:26:24] <scydive> kinda wanna drink these concotions, looking fruity
[2022-12-10 21:26:37] <zantomun> burble and the summon ones are my fav
[2022-12-10 21:26:57] <zantomun> burgle*
[2022-12-10 21:27:04] <%sbergs_> it actually adds 3 cards to your hand - so if you're maestra, it instantly discounts gnolls by 3

[2022-12-10 21:32:06] <shopherodobrasil> maybe taking a copy would be better than swap
[2022-12-10 21:32:19] <bloodbrawler> @bloodbrawler sure huge nerfs Kappa they just need to make it a copy
[2022-12-10 21:32:26] <shopherodobrasil> i hate theo aswell

[2022-12-10 22:33:13] <+Laggiter97> no way, a discolock
[2022-12-10 22:33:23] <LostSoulNaM01> its one of the 2 classes in arena that have above 50% winrate
[2022-12-10 22:33:24] <fjagamer2> well demon hunter was grotesquely overpowered at release, so they tried not to have that happen in constructed agtin, I guess
[2022-12-10 22:33:26] <@%Duje200> @LostSoulNaM01 yeah and that is sad how they didnt balance that either
[2022-12-10 22:33:27] <some_marw> i still think DK release was better then what happened with DH

[2022-12-10 23:40:42] <Arphenyte> He coulda won if he attacked first with deckhand
[2022-12-10 23:40:48] <%$grognardish> he blew lethal at least once
[2022-12-10 23:40:53] <KongxuLoL> only took 80 + armor to stall him
[2022-12-10 23:41:01] <+39shiro> no room for second dredge?
[2022-12-10 23:41:02] <tolisios> finally punished
