[2022-12-25 00:14:43] <hotwomanenjoyer> OWL is mid yawn
[2022-12-25 00:14:46] <%themightyqu1nn> I can't wait for the new map in season 3, just for it to not be in the map pool.
[2022-12-25 00:14:47] <%Prisscylla> OWL is a fucking joke, their care nothing about their players Weirdge

[2022-12-25 00:14:58] <clam245> doing something professionally like gaming just sounds exhausting
[2022-12-25 00:14:58] <%victorjua14> hopefully the overwatch devs got that balancing figured out since they know what the problem is and can address those issue when needed in future seasons

[2022-12-25 00:17:49] <%+yescamz> 150k pounds is good money bro
[2022-12-25 00:17:51] <p1ne4pplefps> @Flats the other thing the average career of ow players is so short compared to other esports like cs or val u see alot of 30+ years old players
[2022-12-25 00:17:54] <%themightyqu1nn> I'm honestly surprised that Danteh is still in OWL. He's been here since season 1 I believe.
[2022-12-25 00:18:00] <ImKyeZ> little bit off topic from owl, but where did you get your name Flats?
[2022-12-25 00:18:05] <%modestghost> 150k dollars in LA is nothing
[2022-12-25 00:18:08] <fanofgta5fr> Hello
[2022-12-25 00:18:11] <%BonkinBonkers> yeaaahhh
[2022-12-25 00:18:14] <soord_n_boord> 150k pounds isn't even a lot either
[2022-12-25 00:18:15] <%sofishdekat> !name @ImKyeZ
[2022-12-25 00:18:15] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
[2022-12-25 00:18:15] <+thefo0master> i live in LA and can confirm im broke every week
[2022-12-25 00:18:21] <%BonkinBonkers> go live in like…… vermont or something
[2022-12-25 00:18:24] <%ow_sigmaeats> 150k is so little in la
[2022-12-25 00:18:25] <yeaipaid> dont save, invest into passive income to fight off inflations, bonds, dividends etc
[2022-12-25 00:18:27] <ImKyeZ> @sofishdekat oh thanks :D

[2022-12-25 00:22:50] <%black_stabath> Legacy mode(6v6) would certainly be interesting. Even with the latest tank balancing. People always adapt and get used to it. People will also always complain and I think it’d be good nostalgia thing to do from the devs.

[2022-12-25 01:05:46] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-25 01:25:51] <vergil_hc> @fireblazewolf420 there is a custom game mode. 12 hogs 1 hole or so. check the gamebrowser for that
[2022-12-25 01:26:05] <vergil_hc> just type HOG in the search
[2022-12-25 01:26:09] <+AidanDoesntStream> Glad they're finally adding good heroes again to this game

[2022-12-25 01:27:09] <vergil_hc> @wolff213 hook is the important part tho. and pressing W + qmelee after a LMB thats pretty much about it

[2022-12-25 17:30:51] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-25 17:32:15] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-25 18:04:29] <+nighttimedev> Merry christmas! Had a question. Just watched your video on aim assist in the context of ow2. You mentioned something really interesting about controller aim assist being necessary in apex due to fighting in close quarters. Do you think it could be caused by pre aiming working even when your pov doesnt have full sight of the enemy?

[2022-12-25 18:53:30] <DIGITMERC> How would you find, if the primary range of hogs shotgun would utterly be max. 10m, the fallout damage further is just very few projectiles. with a little. the right click also less dmg, without spread maybe, jus the single cluster shot.

[2022-12-25 20:11:39] <%+xyberangelz> @Flats there is a reason why that happens especially with a new motherboard.  You need to update either your motherboard Bios or the graphics card driver.  That's whats causing the delay when alt-tabbing for most part.  As reference, I have a dual stream setup as well and ran into that issue.

[2022-12-25 20:24:08] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-25 20:24:41] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-25 22:03:38] <@%^StreamElements> broskinoskiyesir, To earn drops you must claim them from your Twitch Inventory. You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[2022-12-25 22:03:39] <%paddingtonnnn> @chompchomp8 is that because yall want the command on? or you don't know how to blacklist as a mod (no shade trying to be helpful lol)
