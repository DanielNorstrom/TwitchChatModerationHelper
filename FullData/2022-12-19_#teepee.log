[2022-12-19 15:55:54] <%KarlAnthonyPeel> Too much fatigue but he should have powered through
[2022-12-19 15:55:57] <%jorgeelite246> He was coming back from injury and couldn’t go the full 90 min
[2022-12-19 15:55:57] <%+luchey15> Di Maria doesn't have the legs. Scaloni also loves a lead and packing it in.

[2022-12-19 15:57:02] <+femifanibi> He had a thigh injury beforehand so didn't want to risk him for 90mins. Agree that it wasn't the right move but 2-0 up you think it should be safe to do

[2022-12-19 15:57:33] <%+thekingbinger> but the momentum was going to change cuz France was going to push everything forward to try to attack

[2022-12-19 15:57:57] <%+theknave4085> France added a lot of speed to the field along with his fitness warranted to bring in Acuna to play a more defensive style. I agree with you I would have juiced him for what he was worth.

[2022-12-19 16:54:53] <dirtkeef> any nuke attempts on deck ?
[2022-12-19 16:54:54] <%MikeyMase> I’m a Vikings fan. This season has been some weird kind of fun. But like there’s no way they actually can really go anywhere deep with this……change Colts to any legit playoff team and they can’t comeback. Can’t stop watching tho I guess.
[2022-12-19 16:54:55] <@%ChiefsNChop> @masteryo0da or the GIants no call PI LOL

[2022-12-19 16:55:36] <dirtkeef> @MikeyMase yeah theres a definite concern with that defense going against the top squads in NFC. if there is any chance they can grab that 1 seed i think that is their only hope
[2022-12-19 16:55:40] <+FortyCal8> Mag size too weak for fennec
[2022-12-19 16:55:43] <@%ChiefsNChop> @masteryo0da that last no cal PI though, literally decided the game lol.  The refs are "good" this year. lol
[2022-12-19 16:55:46] <%Fupnation> @ChiefsNChop one of the worst missed calls ive seen lol
[2022-12-19 16:55:48] <%DaBeanieBaby> @sirmeowington03 @Fupnation cant wait for them to get bounced wild card weekend

[2022-12-19 20:56:43] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-19 20:58:56] <@%^Streamlabs> Teep has not switched his input, he plays both KBM and controller. Typically he switches when it gets stale. His movement feels better on controller, but his shot feels better on mouse. He’s roughly a 70% - 30% split favoring controller. To tell what he is using, look under his spare plates, if "Y" (controller) if 4 (KBM). teepMnk

[2022-12-19 21:36:49] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-19 23:09:27] <%+kykrank> I actually like the airstrikes with less time to react. But at the same time, there are way too many
[2022-12-19 23:09:30] <%+smootloop5> There are definitely more air strikes than satchels
[2022-12-19 23:09:30] <$SlickRick914> screw it, give us chopper gunners and ac130s too! /s
[2022-12-19 23:09:30] <SeekingAsylum_> Players can carry 5 airstrikes

[2022-12-19 23:09:48] <peuli> i mean i didnt even got 2 wins in a row ;P
[2022-12-19 23:09:52] <klitorus69> I mean you don’t get a PA noti when you’re in a car driving and they put it far enough ahead of you…
[2022-12-19 23:09:57] <sabertoothmooth> there are too many air strikes for sure but it was more zone/team strat that lost this attempt unfortunately
[2022-12-19 23:10:01] <%kfc_bucketz> i just dont understand why they thought it was a good idea to increase the spawn rate of PAs and mortars. like why

[2022-12-19 23:37:15] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info
