[2023-01-11 11:11:31] <+tiberius_moon> They cant give Tracer 6 because there is not hard counter
[2023-01-11 11:11:40] <mollymangomoog> So if I just become the best rn when she gets buffed I’ll be the best that’s what I heard

[2023-01-11 11:22:01] <havel847> @GTCrais thats a horrible idea
[2023-01-11 11:22:01] <+tiberius_moon> @kragiee Its like Widow. One shot headshots require skill and you wont see low ranks hit those shots. But still 130 rail plus primary fire is a lot even compared to widow.
[2023-01-11 11:23:02] <stickmanstock> then she would never be played
[2023-01-11 11:23:06] <mtekinnn> widow needs a nerf 100%. way to op of a character. too ez of a character and such a high reward with no risk. yeah sojourn wasnt good in low rank before but now she's because of these new changes. body shots are ez with sojourn and u get a lot of rail gun shots now and body shot rail gun is just as worth as headshots which is what low ranking players stuggled with on sojourn
[2023-01-11 11:23:36] <+hANseMIl> Isnt widow just a lot stronger in 5v5 compared to 6v6?
[2023-01-11 11:23:39] <axially_reformed> @mtekinnn best copy pasta

[2023-01-11 11:23:51] <stickmanstock> you think blizzard devs actually play their ow game
[2023-01-11 11:23:56] <+tiberius_moon> @kragiee Same thoughs but I was thinking of reducing the charge rate since Soldier's helix is on a 8s CD while you get rail every 2-3s
[2023-01-11 11:24:11] <Brendan_____________> I think ashe is the best designed sniper in this game
[2023-01-11 11:24:28] <mtekinnn> @mtekinnn what i said about widow is what i heard from samito. I got it from Samito and he's 100% right which is why i'm saying it
[2023-01-11 11:24:38] <+tiberius_moon> Fair

[2023-01-11 12:20:09] <+LaL1LuLeL0> if there is no bike lane, the biker tried to overtake on the left, cus they are on the same lane, so he fucked up
[2023-01-11 12:20:13] <!%Mikeverv> Car slowed down at start of clip and also had his blinker on
[2023-01-11 12:20:14] <munglordd> If the driver indicated then the cyclist should have seen and slowed down accordingly, if he didn’t indicate then the driver was in the wrong it’s that ez
[2023-01-11 12:20:18] <Saturdaywww> if the driver signaled then its totally the bikers fault and even if not he was going way too fast
[2023-01-11 12:20:25] <Kirimath> In Japan, If I'm not mistaken, the rule is to go in the street if there is no bike lane

[2023-01-11 12:21:53] <!%Mikeverv> They are on the same road there is no bike lane so biker should stay behind the car in that situation
[2023-01-11 12:22:03] <Tuppelura> The driver almost always get the blame, at least in Norway,  because bikeriders count as a "soft road user", I don't have a better word in english

[2023-01-11 12:27:01] <Saturdaywww> but... its not a biking lane
[2023-01-11 12:27:05] <WhoIsVy> cars yield to bikes in japan so
[2023-01-11 12:27:10] <+Adjilino> Exactly
[2023-01-11 12:27:14] <buttnugget3755> Bikes shouldn’t be on the road just him them
[2023-01-11 12:27:18] <LasoDomia> It's important if the car turned on the light on time to show the biker that he was going to turn so the biker had time enough to react and slow speed
[2023-01-11 12:27:20] <%Klaptos> Hes signalling and theres a turn, he cant overtake. There is no lane
[2023-01-11 12:27:25] <stickmanstock> but its just road so biker should have stopped as well
[2023-01-11 12:27:30] <+Ghostblade1> doesnt cyclist have right of way if hes infront of car but not if hes behind?
[2023-01-11 12:27:40] <%+tm_901> @hoyabembe because a vehicle stopped in front of him and he couldnt stop in time
[2023-01-11 12:27:46] <DugMcUgly> I bike and ride motorcycles.  My take would be, rules be damned, you have to watch your own ass.  Car may be wrong, but he has the advantage in a 1 vs 1…..

[2023-01-11 12:29:17] <%bebex001_> and be predictable. that's the most important thing in traffic
[2023-01-11 12:29:41] <theamazingins> trust other drivers as much as u would a plat moira
[2023-01-11 12:29:42] <shnowyyy> i agree, but sometimes it's hard to have that mentality when you have to do it 24/7
[2023-01-11 12:29:54] <%Nytan_TW> Even if you have the right never trust other in the street
[2023-01-11 12:30:08] <Teccon> I think you should drive like trevor in GTA. You're most important because you're the main character KKonaW

[2023-01-11 12:30:39] <+buffn99> @alexe0208 You have an obligation to try to stop or avoid an accident when you're behind someone, which is why when you get rear ended it's almost always the other person's fault. The biker would definitely be liable
[2023-01-11 12:30:43] <%+tm_901> you seem to jump a lot without shift, isnt that bad as it makes your movement predictable kragiee?

[2023-01-11 12:33:47] <Geritoking> @kragiee Cause I see ppl talk about Widow a lot. But the stats just arent there she is good not that dominant as ppl say. And I rarely see widow dominate high elo streamers too.

[2023-01-11 12:36:43] <+forsberg7hs> torb vs ball is meta
[2023-01-11 12:36:52] <Geritoking> @kragiee I know and she has negative wr and like barely top10 pickrate. Maybe I just cant understand the game that well atm.

[2023-01-11 14:45:32] <+AlmandoTV> Bruh play your OP tracer. Sojourn is so ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-11 14:45:54] <+AlmandoTV> :( :(
[2023-01-11 14:46:04] <Ghost5768> I miss tracer gameplay
[2023-01-11 14:46:08] <MikaSoftPaws> Is it cause she so squishy?
[2023-01-11 14:46:29] <mozzymo1> Play sym then

[2023-01-11 14:47:03] <airvine7> Then how is Sym good? She doesn’t one shot.
[2023-01-11 14:47:33] <+LudaChrisly> I wish my portfolio was as hard to kill as Orisa.
[2023-01-11 14:47:40] <+AlmandoTV> I think sym utility skills this meta is insane

[2023-01-11 14:48:13] <+999Clipped> top tier movement
[2023-01-11 14:48:25] <LasoDomia> So as a dps what is the best way to annoy/deal with orisa?
[2023-01-11 14:48:48] <+Goryllo> @MikaSoftPaws and of course sojourn one shots you without mercy because she is good and balanced hero

[2023-01-11 14:49:44] <+LudaChrisly> Cassady and Genji's in my games last night were getting destroyed by tanks.
[2023-01-11 14:49:44] <yorandomman12> That’s why Cassidy is cheeks
[2023-01-11 14:49:47] <airvine7> Isn’t reaper good though?
[2023-01-11 14:49:49] <%Saber_Ramoth> What about reaper, isn’t he decent? Or no
[2023-01-11 14:49:57] <%wildkraut> i cant aim so i just play junk and spam
[2023-01-11 14:50:04] <+N4SixString> it probably will change some next week when they nerf hog but you will still have orissa
[2023-01-11 14:50:35] <%wildkraut> but.... reaperguy
[2023-01-11 14:50:42] <+LudaChrisly> At least Reaper has a lot of "get out of jail" abilities.
[2023-01-11 14:50:52] <airvine7> Why did they play Reaper in OW league tho?
[2023-01-11 14:50:55] <!%Mikeverv> And he even has two guns
[2023-01-11 14:50:56] <%+SeroDPS> Reaper is winton killer

[2023-01-11 14:51:12] <yorandomman12> Cuz they play full dive in ow league
[2023-01-11 14:51:15] <+SanZe_Hope> mb rewaper should have a passive that gives him increased dmg based on how much hp target has
[2023-01-11 14:51:19] <+LudaChrisly> Chat, where does Reaper get the guns?
[2023-01-11 14:51:22] <rizuosu> @Tsuniko reaper
[2023-01-11 14:51:34] <+LudaChrisly> And why does Kiriko have to reload knives if she is only ever holding one?
[2023-01-11 14:52:09] <+dubramaster> sojourn a solid choice for comp?
[2023-01-11 14:52:10] <chulo7375> how long have the match start ups been?

[2023-01-11 14:53:15] <Tsuniko> just make reaper fat and make him into a tank

[2023-01-11 14:53:17] <adrianwreckz> Hmmmm
[2023-01-11 14:53:26] <LasoDomia> And as a tank what would be a good pick to face Orisa, Zarya maybe?
[2023-01-11 14:53:31] <+AlmandoTV> I think everyone is just so bored of seeing sojourn every game :D
[2023-01-11 14:53:43] <Saturdaywww> exactly 6 places away :)

[2023-01-11 14:53:46] <+zHetzer> @kragiee In you opinion, what are the best and worst tanks at the game?
[2023-01-11 14:53:49] <adrianwreckz> Keep the winstreak going
[2023-01-11 14:53:55] <adrianwreckz> You willl get there

[2023-01-11 14:53:59] <homelesswithoutthem> Winston is good
[2023-01-11 14:54:02] <%mollymangomoog> I don’t wanna play hit scan
[2023-01-11 14:54:08] <airvine7> I wonder how you solve this problem, because I agree tanks are too strong. But honesty where we left off in OW1, I would actually get deleted on Rein. It was so broken how fast I would die. @kragiee
[2023-01-11 14:54:09] <nemebliss> Orisa, the unkillable battle cow
[2023-01-11 14:54:12] <Fishingforbig> Give reaper more shots in his clip

[2023-01-11 14:54:15] <%oSkywen> keep in mind that OWL comp you guys mentioned earlier chat was 2 months ago. a couple patches ago. and they had barely any time to workshop that patch
