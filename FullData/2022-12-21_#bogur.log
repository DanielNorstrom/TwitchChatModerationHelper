[2022-12-21 22:41:48] <%orcpa1adin> i recently discovered that kiriko had an event voiceline during halloween called "tarot reading", pretty self-explanatory about what it says
[2022-12-21 22:42:04] <%orcpa1adin> and now kiriko has this misty/tris inspired skin
[2022-12-21 22:42:42] <%orcpa1adin> nice little touch of references imo
[2022-12-21 22:43:02] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> it was for the witch skin since her fudas are tarot cards on that skin
[2022-12-21 22:43:09] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> it also has like 4 different voice lines in that voice line, pretty cool
[2022-12-21 22:43:34] <%orcpa1adin> @メイシーちゃん only 4? i thought there could be more

[2022-12-21 22:45:03] <%orcpa1adin> @メイシーちゃん misty from cyberpunk also did tarot reading in game. maybe it's just a coincidence, but looks cool altogether
