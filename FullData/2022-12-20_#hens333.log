[2022-12-20 15:32:24] <%+xploitr13> DH can win games so yes
[2022-12-20 15:32:25] <SCOER__> he cerainly does now
[2022-12-20 15:32:25] <GhalaxticFester> No itâs not to strong
[2022-12-20 15:32:26] <+NekoShepherd> I would be malding if I were him.
[2022-12-20 15:32:27] <+pbevertv> a bit yeah
[2022-12-20 15:32:28] <Amata19> yes but it's better than it was at least
[2022-12-20 15:32:30] <GhalaxticFester> And Iâm a killer main
[2022-12-20 15:32:31] <SCOER__> but no KEKW
[2022-12-20 15:32:33] <%+haws3> I did before I started playing more survivor and dealing with this horrendous kick meta, ITS FINE

[2022-12-20 15:32:35] <imkloon> thejrmNo
[2022-12-20 15:32:41] <%the_oracle_> the issue of needing to wait out DH for an eternity hasnt really changed tbh Sadge
[2022-12-20 15:32:47] <poisntree> dh is too strong at high levels but hard to use at low levels i think
[2022-12-20 15:32:53] <GhalaxticFester> Ya but you donât have a different perk because of it
[2022-12-20 15:32:54] <MinerallWater> you countered his counter to the counter to the counter
[2022-12-20 15:32:55] <Daarkuh> it's kinda get out of jail free card
[2022-12-20 15:32:57] <GhalaxticFester> Itâs fine
[2022-12-20 15:32:57] <%helllcate_> it doesn't feel AS bad but yeah the waiting thing is goofy
[2022-12-20 15:32:59] <Modus718> whenever I run DH half the time it doesn't work cause I try to react and ping
[2022-12-20 15:32:59] <+NekoShepherd> i don't care if DH is OP or not, it's the most infuriating thing on the planet as killer
[2022-12-20 15:33:03] <Chemot0x> he has eruption. i don't have to say more LULW
[2022-12-20 15:33:07] <claymanx95> Just happened to win the 50/50 but for the most part itâs hard to pull off dh when they wait that long
[2022-12-20 15:33:11] VIEWERS: 369
[2022-12-20 15:33:11] <One__T> I think it is as it supposed to be, tho it's kinda shit that DH can be useless against legion/deathlinger that put you in deap wond state
[2022-12-20 15:33:18] <+CarissMcbober> I wish ping didn't play such a big role in DH, but I don't know a good solution to taking that out of it
[2022-12-20 15:33:24] <grumblephant> I mean, They got rid of the speed boost so that's cool.
[2022-12-20 15:33:30] <%+haws3> it i s pretty funny to get end game chat complaints about DH when the killer is running COB/Eruptiom/OC
[2022-12-20 15:33:33] <One__T> deep wopund*
[2022-12-20 15:33:40] <poisntree> @One__T legion and slinger need all the help they can get against strong teams tho imo
[2022-12-20 15:33:40] <GhalaxticFester> @one__t right it can be op in situations but other times it can be useless
[2022-12-20 15:33:54] <+lordsquishyy> @haws3 this
[2022-12-20 15:34:01] <levillier> Any idea when we might get the new HUD update that shows small icons next to portrait to indicate what your teammates are doing? PauseChamp

[2022-12-20 15:35:28] <%helllcate_> @levillier probs true but eh maybe it's just one of several solo q helpers
[2022-12-20 15:35:31] <how2eat> I feel like if people used sprint burst as dh itâll just create more problems

[2022-12-20 15:59:19] <poisntree> @TheRealExE if you don't have any stacks of condemn, there's no reason to take a tape. taking a tape is to lower your stacks of condemn, but having one passively builds up your stacks

[2022-12-20 15:59:29] <SchokomokoTTV> hate it, when killer do that.. they think its nice to not kill anyone soon, but in the end, it is just a big waste of time for everybody

[2022-12-20 15:59:40] <+NekoShepherd> I only take tape if preventing that across map teleport is ultra important, other than that, yeah, it's pointless
[2022-12-20 15:59:48] <Modus718> well you turn off the TV but that's kind of minor
[2022-12-20 15:59:49] <poisntree> or to farm blood points, you can kinda use it to prevent teleports yeah but it's not normally worth
[2022-12-20 15:59:57] <%MrRyanFish> @SchokomokoTTV Ok, but you take someone else out early and you get moaned at. so like you can't win
[2022-12-20 16:00:00] <+odie_pickledchaos> Killers arenât playing to make survivors happy tho so
[2022-12-20 16:00:04] <+RactusTheRat> Did the tapes used to nerf the killer?
[2022-12-20 16:00:12] <Tomik4098> its like cleansing all totems to prevent noed
[2022-12-20 16:00:21] <%MrRyanFish> @RactusTheRat Tapes turn off the TV stopping the killer TPing to them
[2022-12-20 16:00:23] <knifola> i like the "professor hens" channel name choice LULW
[2022-12-20 16:00:27] <poisntree> @RactusTheRat they don't nerf her, but if you take a tape (or put one in a tv) it turns the tv off so she can't teleport to it for a while
[2022-12-20 16:00:54] <Crazymack556> I wish taking tapes was to counter Onryo teleporting around freely rather then condemn. In other words TVs would have much shorter CD. But I guess that too rough for new players.
[2022-12-20 16:01:01] <SchokomokoTTV> @MrRyanFish sure, but yo u cannot fullfill the other's roles expectations or objectives without betraying your own

[2022-12-20 16:09:32] <poisntree> @MrRyanFish killers get stuck more easily than survivor for some weird reason
[2022-12-20 16:09:45] <%MrRyanFish> @poisntree I mean on survivor not as killer
[2022-12-20 16:09:57] <+odie_pickledchaos> Killers have bigger hit boxes which is why

[2022-12-20 16:58:01] <0rochimarusnake> for me she still best range killer but she and slinger are kinda close
[2022-12-20 16:58:03] <%peepoLed> huntress is pretty balanced overall tho
[2022-12-20 16:58:05] <@%^Nightbot> Remember that you're always loved, treasured, and accepted. Bad days will pass, but friends will always stay. hensL
[2022-12-20 16:58:12] <+Marco_MinxXIV> she makes pallets and vaults really unsafe though
[2022-12-20 16:58:15] <%eviedudette> omg, I thought you said that Huntress is not EIGHTY (year old or? XD) instead of A Tier
