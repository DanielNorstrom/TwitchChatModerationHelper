[2022-12-28 13:36:55] <hassan_u9> yes yes i seen a youtuber talking about this, hidden same old SR ranking underneath the hood
[2022-12-28 13:37:06] <%Jojiil1> once i got to gold 4 my games became more one sided
[2022-12-28 13:37:13] <%+bo_lamb> yea I only played a few games after my placement and then gave up as it got too hard lol
[2022-12-28 13:37:17] <1__shadow__> the game matchmakers one person against you on the other team , which shortens queue time but generally results in bat matchups
[2022-12-28 13:37:31] <%+deadzombieking> I was a platinum tank and support and a high gold DPS last I did my placements back in overwatch 1

[2022-12-28 13:38:20] <1__shadow__> for example in this game the only person the same rank as you is the enemy tank others can be up to diamond
[2022-12-28 13:38:20] <%gitrickt> games like these, at some point, at least for me if i ever played OW, at some point i feel like i would stop caring about ranks since it was so inaccurate or i just give up on caring

[2022-12-28 13:48:27] <+Rubenmw3> i think what makes losing on OW2 even more annoying is the fact that u dont see ur SR anymore so u dnt know what ur wokring towards
[2022-12-28 13:48:49] <%+btsensei27> mmhmm
[2022-12-28 13:48:49] <%atomchoco> i understand that ... i have been there

[2022-12-28 13:49:02] <i_lexii> Exactly I think the ranking system is a bit off
[2022-12-28 13:49:03] <+SamuraiJericho> yeah idk why they took out that aspect
[2022-12-28 13:49:08] <%BallieTV> Or when enemy team has 3 people with the same icon

[2022-12-28 15:56:38] <emlymlive> opiods are one of the most abused and addictive drugs
[2022-12-28 15:56:45] <%jonno98> I wonder why the doctor lost their license
[2022-12-28 15:56:49] <+MC_Donhou> do you want to be addicted to drugs or in constant pain. Tough choice
[2022-12-28 15:56:51] <Lilainne> unfortunately those tend to be addictive substances so its recommended to use them as a last resort
[2022-12-28 15:56:55] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> Opiates are literally the most addictive and destructive drugs you can take
[2022-12-28 15:57:02] <%atomchoco> medical system is not good right now
[2022-12-28 15:57:07] <MathyCrimson_> The fact that peoples' health is considered 'politics' is kinda sad tbh.
[2022-12-28 15:57:12] <%markpygas> Probably prescribing too many opioids
[2022-12-28 15:57:17] <MathyCrimson_> I hate American healthcare man, it's so ass backwards.
[2022-12-28 15:57:22] <emlymlive> they might have had super bad pain from the withdrawls
[2022-12-28 15:57:23] <%HKAdam> perscribing drugs like that too much could do it

[2022-12-28 15:58:17] <%markpygas> The addictive nature wasn't very well known when they first came out
[2022-12-28 15:58:29] <Lilainne> some doctors over prescribe them because they get kickbacks
[2022-12-28 15:58:43] <Lilainne> thats way the DEA has gotten stricter
[2022-12-28 15:58:45] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> Drugs aren't sold to medicate in American, drugs are sold to profit, so they don't care.

[2022-12-28 16:00:14] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> In the UK pretty much all prescription drugs cost the same; £9.35 (about $8). Doctors don't get paid to prescribe drugs, so they only issue them when you need them.

[2022-12-28 16:01:40] <emlymlive> oh yeah fs they do
[2022-12-28 16:01:43] <%explodingsockpuppet> 1000%
[2022-12-28 16:01:43] <+xtaenygg> 100%
[2022-12-28 16:01:46] <%Druyv> In the US for sure
[2022-12-28 16:01:47] <Trex6821> the difference in the price for necessary drugs like insulin between the US and other countries is insane to me
[2022-12-28 16:01:49] <@%fabriisio> farma is a big bussiness
[2022-12-28 16:01:54] <ToughCuukie> oh for sure! it happens most of the time in my country, sadly
[2022-12-28 16:01:54] <%bobleeswagger27> Your neck ok? I got off your stream to take a nap and just now got back on to see you with a neck brace
[2022-12-28 16:01:54] <MathyCrimson_> I'm convinced they get paid per prescription.
[2022-12-28 16:01:55] <94voyuki> that's why i don't trust anyone
[2022-12-28 16:01:56] <+qmilay> my doctors office has samples of certain drugs and they push them more
[2022-12-28 16:01:56] <+r3dninja> Yea they get kick backs
[2022-12-28 16:01:58] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> Yeah, Drug companies send sales reps to secure contracts with doctors to sell drugs for them.
[2022-12-28 16:02:01] <YoMommaGoofy> it induces heart attacks but youll be fine says the doc Kappa
[2022-12-28 16:02:02] <%zorg666> they usually favor the ones that have worked well with other patients

[2022-12-28 16:02:13] <%+mysticangel18> If a doctor ignores your symptoms and tries gaslighting you, it’s better to start looking for a new one

[2022-12-28 16:02:20] <Lilainne> but sometimes its beacuse their particular patients had better experiences with that medication. its not always a bad thing
[2022-12-28 16:02:27] <%markpygas> Streamers are sponsored by gamer chairs, doctors are sponsored by morphine
[2022-12-28 16:02:30] <%+mysticangel18> Some doctors like to keep patients sick just for profit
[2022-12-28 16:02:34] <%VizeReZ> Reporting side effects is a lot of pain in the ass for them. They could lose some sponsorship for some meds and deal with potential malpractice.

[2022-12-28 16:10:36] <Lilainne> once i had a doctor refuse to give me medication because she "wanted me to stay pure" docs are scary sometimes
[2022-12-28 16:10:39] <yoloking_13> I think the doctor was just trying to be safe, coz its hard to give meds based on the diagnosis of another doctor, esp if its psychiatric conditions

I looked around and found one with an appointment open two week from then and asked my doc if they were in network. Sometimes you can do your own footwork and it might get done faster.

[2022-12-28 16:13:49] <yoloking_13> Maybe it was just phrased in a bad way but Im sure the doctor was trying to figure out possible causes of your symptoms.

[2022-12-28 16:16:19] <%jonno98> The fact that he changed your meds right after is concerning

[2022-12-28 16:17:03] <%+mysticangel18> @fabriisio just wanted to see if there was one to get a opinion from someone in the field
[2022-12-28 16:17:11] <%markpygas> Fax is probably more secure compared to email
[2022-12-28 16:17:13] <YoMommaGoofy> if they still use fax machines you gotta jump ship
[2022-12-28 16:17:13] <$endlesslogfile> it's a legal thing
[2022-12-28 16:17:13] <%gitrickt> @mysticangel18 @fabriisio mental health doctor related?
[2022-12-28 16:17:15] <+Lulucons> fax seems to be common for medical stuff
[2022-12-28 16:17:16] <Lilainne> you can encrypt email too xD they live in the 80s
[2022-12-28 16:17:20] <Kartoffel1> Dated legal reasons is likely why they use fax machines.
[2022-12-28 16:17:21] <MathyCrimson_> Probably because they're working on dinosaur technology.
[2022-12-28 16:17:26] <DyingcrazyA> medical places still use fax to communicate
[2022-12-28 16:17:35] <saltedeggbanz> i worked in the health industry once, its more of like they dont want to have patients flooding the Doctors when communicating

[2022-12-28 20:22:12] <joshdabozz123> he is currently one of the best tanks ATM and just should not be allowed to one shot. Pair him up with good supports (Kiriko and Lucio), and hes an unstoppable machine
[2022-12-28 20:22:24] <@%jojoppa> thats not cheap tbh because it really depends on the size and resolution of the monitor

[2022-12-28 20:50:06] <$schweinski> Ramattra ain't that bad imo. The ult sucks when you're playing as a less mobile hero, but otherwise he's pretty easy to take down

[2022-12-28 20:50:35] <%+saintsomar> better bastion always wins
[2022-12-28 20:50:37] <+tiffanycrosses> can you shoot Ram’s shield down or is it just a timed thing?
[2022-12-28 20:50:43] <joshdabozz123> @schweinski hes a chicken really. he dies fast and likes to hide because he needs to poke
[2022-12-28 20:50:43] <%trixxiev> peepoPrime
[2022-12-28 20:50:50] <@%jojoppa> you can shoot the shield
[2022-12-28 20:50:51] <joshdabozz123> @tiffanycrosses it has health but it is also timed
[2022-12-28 20:50:54] <@%jojoppa> but it doesnt last long

[2022-12-28 20:52:27] <+KAChronic> @MrTropicalCoconut no brain, just aim
[2022-12-28 20:52:30] <frugaljt> i think sombra was good @ 40% damage amp but at like 25% shes kinda ass
[2022-12-28 20:52:54] <$schweinski> Their Mercy healbotting pretty bad
[2022-12-28 20:53:02] <$schweinski> 0 dmg lol
[2022-12-28 20:53:10] <joshdabozz123> Ram needs 3 buffs really.   1. Either make the shield not timed or lower cooldown. 2. Needs more health 3. His radius attack (Forget its name) Needs to actually work. it is pretty bad rn
[2022-12-28 20:53:32] <calypsonite> one time, I was playing kiriko fighting their dps, the sombra was there watching silently, then left me to die instead of doing something
