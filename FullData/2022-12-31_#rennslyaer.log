[2022-12-31 06:04:15] <!%ImamuraCross> After entering The Stranger, head down the river to the right, and immediately get off the raft to enter the hut with the Ghost Matter on it; you found an Artefact there. There's also another hut just a little more down the river; you removed the lanterns in the building, but didn't get to explore downstairs too much; perhaps start there :>

[2022-12-31 08:44:02] <!%ImamuraCross> It hurts you because, as it is crafted to do, this game promotes growth inside oneself as a person. By confronting you with the existential fears that you would normally flee at the sight of, this experience inevitably serves as a catalyst for you, the player, to break down and overcome those internal walls, becoming stronger, and more whole, as a person.
[2022-12-31 08:44:03] <!%ImamuraCross> But also, it funny to watch dog scream, haha 🙂

[2022-12-31 08:53:40] <!%ImamuraCross> Would you like me to tell you if you don't have enough clues if you've tried to explore any given area many times?
[2022-12-31 08:54:24] <!%ImamuraCross> Okay, you don't have enough information to do anything here rn.
[2022-12-31 08:54:28] <!%ImamuraCross> :')
[2022-12-31 08:54:52] <!%ImamuraCross> But there is the Cinder Isles Tower, which I know you have something of a hatred for, but you have to accept it back into your life, Renn.

You can't get angry at the people who wrote the recipe because you technically didn't follow all instructions

[2022-12-31 11:05:13] <!%ImamuraCross> Fun fact about the lighting engine for this game: To prevent people from cheesing these sections by raising gamma or brightness of the screen, any objects in the dark simply do not render 🙂

[2022-12-31 11:06:10] <!%ImamuraCross> They're always in the same location, and if they spot you, their pathfinding AI kicks in to try and locate you.

[2022-12-31 11:08:21] <!%ImamuraCross> @StygianWarden0 So the fun thing about that is, Renn's lantern can conceal its flame, right? They have the same kind of lantern; they conceal their flame to try and sneak up on you.
[2022-12-31 11:08:23] <!%ImamuraCross> 🙂
[2022-12-31 11:08:51] <%$StygianWarden0> I get that, but the fact they can spot you without having their lantern active
[2022-12-31 11:09:13] <%iconic_toblerone> you can do it renn!
[2022-12-31 11:09:29] <!%ImamuraCross> They can only spot you if you're lit up; so if your lantern is off, and you're standing in darkness, they won't know where you are 👀

[2022-12-31 15:02:04] <Floryan_Nez> It is theorized that The Big Bang is not the only one. Think a dense core cracking and chipping over billions of years. They say we're not the first and won't be the last.

[2022-12-31 15:03:45] <Ridley_Prime> there was no saving yours. it was the end. but rather in living in a loop, repeating in the same pattern, or sleeping away in a simulation, you chose to break the cycle and move forward, to make the future better for the people who come later
