[2023-01-11 08:05:49] <!%bert3326> isn't the Battlecry for 16 damage but the bc on 4 and 7 is for adding one to your hand,  so you'd get more astalors
[2023-01-11 08:06:00] <%ublighthero> The manathirst is encompassed within the battlecry
[2023-01-11 08:06:04] <%ublighthero> is my only guess

[2023-01-11 08:06:49] <!%bert3326> the question was why brann works on big astalor but not small ones

[2023-01-11 08:06:54] <$DanTheSpoon> @MetastaticHS because the 8-cost astalors bloodthirst increases the damage of the battlecry making it 16, where'as the other manathirsts are nothing to do with the battlecry
[2023-01-11 08:07:14] <+oBarnabus> @vattis90 been like that for maybe 2 expansions at least
[2023-01-11 08:07:16] <!%ChibbaTron> nada, how're you? new beanie?
[2023-01-11 08:07:47] <Belgian_Rofls> Brann astalor does 24 i thought

[2023-01-11 08:07:51] <%MetastaticHS> So it shouldn‚Äôt deal 32 damage then
[2023-01-11 08:08:04] <%JohanTaty> It does in the third Astalor only
[2023-01-11 08:08:07] <%JohanTaty> So stupid
[2023-01-11 08:08:17] <%Synastar> I don‚Äôt think anything should deal 32 damage lol

[2023-01-11 08:08:35] <%Synastar> ?
[2023-01-11 08:08:39] <%JohanTaty> A nerf at this plus a slow down to rogue will make the standard interesting
[2023-01-11 08:08:39] <%Synastar> Or attack?
[2023-01-11 08:09:07] <!%bert3326> it's battlecry deals 8, the manathirst probably is coded to double that and then brann does again
[2023-01-11 08:09:27] <%Synastar> That‚Äôs pretty ducking cool though. Is Brann in standard rn? No right? He hasn‚Äôt been around since like Un Goro?
[2023-01-11 08:09:35] <UglyAbeezy> astalar is super a problem
[2023-01-11 08:09:40] <%trip_rd> it's a problem in fucking wild LUL

[2023-01-11 08:09:48] <$DanTheSpoon> brann is in standard
[2023-01-11 08:10:03] <%Synastar> O wow
[2023-01-11 08:10:06] <+Remster101> I would argue astalor is the most problematic card in standard right now
[2023-01-11 08:10:07] <!%ChibbaTron> core set rotates each year right?
[2023-01-11 08:10:20] <%Synastar> So Bran plus Astalar is OTK?

[2023-01-11 08:15:41] <!%ChibbaTron> tft is hard to learn at first
[2023-01-11 08:15:46] <%Synastar> It‚Äôs got a super high skill cap too
[2023-01-11 08:15:54] <%Synastar> And a major time learning curve
[2023-01-11 08:16:00] <%ApatheticOne> I'll trade you one spanking for your cake Mr Red MmmHmm
[2023-01-11 08:16:12] <!%ChibbaTron> it gets easier with time, but there are a lot of moving parts to keep up with and it's stressful when you're new
[2023-01-11 08:16:18] <%Synastar> League of Legends had probably the biggest learning curve ever for me
[2023-01-11 08:16:24] <%+CamelCityJohn> here we go baby

[2023-01-11 09:23:46] <fitzgamer> The enchanter says they take twice as much damage, so i don't think it counts as the spell dealing that extra damage. Pretty weird wording tho

[2023-01-11 09:24:07] <+NPBrot> I think it deals the damage first and then the enchanted doubles it
[2023-01-11 09:24:07] <+Bare_Naked_Gamer> spell damage changes the number shown on the card
[2023-01-11 09:24:33] <+NPBrot> So the card still considers it to be draw 2 before the damage is doubled

[2023-01-11 11:48:55] <!%Ellyon> @Tazny have you learned how to wistle since then?
[2023-01-11 11:49:56] <!%Ellyon> whistle
[2023-01-11 11:49:57] <@%Tazny> @Ellyon Yeah not very well but I can whistle now, and I kinda understand now why it was so hard to explain it because I dont think I can either lol

[2023-01-11 11:50:54] <%talrielz> hivemind chain comments can be so funny sometimes. there was some reddit post about like a fun fact that mark cuban set the world record for an online purchase in 1999 and all the comments are like "maybe he should purchase some fucking talent to surround Luka with" or "maybe he can set the world record for buying players to play with luka"
[2023-01-11 11:51:12] <!%Ellyon> I always explain it like how a flute works, like a recorder or well any flute... the airstream needs to be divided and how it is divided makes a tone. Like blowing on a beer bottle
[2023-01-11 11:51:18] <%talrielz> i think you follow the nba so u would understand
[2023-01-11 11:51:45] <!%Ellyon> blowing on a beer bottle is easier to explain because most people can do it. When someone that can't whistle can do that they can practice to get the same effect with the lips
[2023-01-11 11:51:49] <%talrielz> yeah but there is luxury tax
[2023-01-11 11:51:50] <+tudoulol> yes
[2023-01-11 11:51:55] <%talrielz> and teams that want to win go over it

[2023-01-11 11:52:00] <%talrielz> i.e. warriors

[2023-01-11 11:52:21] <@%Tazny> @Ellyon I wish you were around while I was trying to figure it out Pog
[2023-01-11 11:52:22] <Zeprido> @ellyon I can't whistle anymore :(
[2023-01-11 11:52:41] <%talrielz> modern nba is weird cuz its a lot of tampering to create super teams
[2023-01-11 11:52:42] <%ACGsteve> what's free agency?
[2023-01-11 11:53:02] <%talrielz> KD to warriors, all lebron teams, the current nets team
[2023-01-11 11:53:03] <!%Ellyon> @Zeprido after you recover I'm sure you'll get the hang of it again
[2023-01-11 11:53:05] <%$AllaMassterran> that's illegal
[2023-01-11 11:53:27] <Stripsearch> wasnt Joker like 48th pick or something
[2023-01-11 11:53:39] <%$bbart2412> not 12-0 but lets get 12 wins at least. maybe 13...
[2023-01-11 11:53:56] <Zeprido> @ellyon well, tongue reconstruction involves grafting muscle from your arm or thigh to what remains and making it into a "tongue", so I'm unsure
[2023-01-11 11:53:57] VIEWERS: 825
[2023-01-11 11:54:01] <%talrielz> I think the nets are only 1.5 games back from the celtics
[2023-01-11 11:54:09] <%talrielz> and they started off slow with Nash
[2023-01-11 11:54:26] <Grimxz> i got a dh right now with 4 crow's nest
[2023-01-11 11:54:27] <%Miksa6> Is malignant horror the most problematic DK card?
[2023-01-11 11:54:59] <%$AllaMassterran> I bet 100 nothing on this run, u better not give up @redbeard nosferatuRRRage
[2023-01-11 11:55:00] <!%Ellyon> @Zeprido I didn't know that! Never met anyone that needed it
[2023-01-11 11:55:15] <%talrielz> yeah it is the most problematic DK card due to both its prevalence being the highest offered DK card as well as how difficult it is to deal with and how it warps games when it comes down
[2023-01-11 11:55:51] <Zeprido> @talrielz I don't think you were here when I told red and chat, but I had a seizure and bit my tongue off :(
