[2022-12-28 16:50:49] <Floody_IRL> I like having hc avail first then myth a week later, but just have myth release the same day as N A NA

[2022-12-28 16:50:54] <+LurtZwOw> @GingiTV kinda funny how liquid were saying the nerf made it one shottable and then it took them like 6 hours to actually kill it
[2022-12-28 16:50:55] <docgel> both guilds stuck around 65% in phase 2 for 24hours... then 12 hours later dead... the 2nd half of that boss was a joke
[2022-12-28 16:50:57] <Togec1> Both EU and NA raiders are saying the early mythic release was a mistake
[2022-12-28 16:50:59] <+Appoc> @GingiTV If they knew they were going to nerf it, they should have waited for Liquid to be awake and in the raid for a few pulls not do it while one of the best guilds was asleep

[2022-12-28 16:51:04] <rjstorbaek> mythic being released at the start made it more interesting
[2022-12-28 16:51:08] <NoneLikeTrynd> @GingiTV sanctum was way more hype sylvannas kill was sick
[2022-12-28 16:51:10] <+sirdreadeye> next one, they should fly all competitors to a neutral country and play without time zone issues.
[2022-12-28 16:51:11] <zysmos> was good until you guys hit raszageth KEKW
[2022-12-28 16:51:11] <+Folk_Daddy> Remember how hard it was to get Thunderfury when it first came out, same thing with hand of Rag! those were the good ol days~!
[2022-12-28 16:51:18] <%colgara> Ending was fine imo, if Liquid had 1 shot when they logged i would say otherwise but it still took them a few pulls
[2022-12-28 16:51:22] <+Masonxq> LOL
[2022-12-28 16:51:25] <sanakvasilius> LUL
[2022-12-28 16:51:28] <BARCON92> it was nerfed 10am for Liquid, they can wake up sooner next time when they know the race is close

[2022-12-28 16:51:43] <%sStouby> but it helps XD
[2022-12-28 16:51:43] <aslanpratar> I think the last phase nerf was too big, you where not that far off from killing it and after the nerf you killed it easily with 20 people alive..
[2022-12-28 16:51:43] <%+Dazdru> It had to be nerfed otherwise y'all would have been raiding over christmas
[2022-12-28 16:51:45] <%+W0nder87> Roger said yesterday they nerfed too much it would be enough when they nerfed the zone in last phase
[2022-12-28 16:51:45] <+Tuchh> @GingiTV be honest, what rank would you be without split raiding?
[2022-12-28 16:51:46] <+Appoc> Also alot of those bosses are normally dead by the time you guys get a shot at the raid
[2022-12-28 16:51:48] <+UltraInstinctNacho> not sure what to do

[2022-12-28 16:52:41] <%+Bennodkk> they would've won ragardless of when the nerf hits it was clear to see t hey were 10 times better on last boss
[2022-12-28 16:52:50] <skyesarrow> Yeah we get the strats but for a viewer the release of all difficulties at the same time killed the viewer experience no one wants to watch splits and dungeons for days before even starting the race. @gingitv but the raid itself is good.
[2022-12-28 16:52:50] <Rekcalzgaming> @GingiTV in mythic+ what would you play as arcane or fire ?
[2022-12-28 16:52:54] <%RwLmaster> its like trying to say you need to win every event at a decathlon to win a decathlon

[2022-12-28 16:53:38] <STAIGZOR2> They were probably unsure if it was killable and didnt want to leave it like that while they have their company holiday @GingiTV
[2022-12-28 16:53:40] <+dmac614> This race didn’t feel fun to watch this year… just didn’t have the spark like usual
[2022-12-28 16:53:52] <+zo0t3d> Just horrible timing on release should of waited till after holidays and not nerf last phase

[2022-12-28 16:57:03] <+Lillpapps> @Tuchh 1 because then no one else could split raid either
[2022-12-28 16:57:07] <%+EliteFourLance_> Max was saying how shadow priest was low key underrated following the buffs. Did you guys feel the same?
[2022-12-28 16:57:07] <%sander1no> GG GINGI!!!! Huge race always big blast <3
[2022-12-28 16:57:10] <%+dNNar0L> they fought half a day more
[2022-12-28 16:57:10] <%almaster55> was it not close to bedtime when u killed it?
[2022-12-28 16:57:19] <+Tuchh> @Lillpapps i disagree
[2022-12-28 16:57:25] <Sniekiej> in the end it wasnt that close at all since u got like 100 pulls less then everyone else like sheesh
[2022-12-28 16:57:38] <aaron96_> liquid struggled on p1 it seemed
[2022-12-28 16:57:44] <+shaygauge24> how was the food at the facility? I saw scripe poundong spaghetti like it was his last meal on earth

[2022-12-28 16:57:58] <psz90> on rogue
[2022-12-28 16:57:58] <%+Drheer> the splits and the 1lvl made the catchup so yeah a good split management and gear is for sure what diff liquid and echo from others
[2022-12-28 16:58:04] <%aitonx> true
[2022-12-28 16:58:05] <+Anthy1887> some analyst must have been awake between 8 and 10am
[2022-12-28 16:58:13] <mysterious_guy> But yours was the last boss
[2022-12-28 16:58:17] <Kevin_Pantera> they knew fix was coming and they didnt start raiding till 11am
[2022-12-28 16:58:18] <%+dNNar0L> life is not fair
[2022-12-28 16:58:19] <+Nerendis> I think the sleeping argument is copium honestly. They could have been up. But it still took them hours to finish the kill anyway, so I don’t buy they anti-liquid bias argument.
[2022-12-28 16:58:20] <julle2> Tbh i think liquid will start to abandon after 3 L's
[2022-12-28 16:58:20] <dino0n> should fly to the "friendliest" time zone :p
[2022-12-28 16:58:26] <venyafaylei> More and more reasons to have global releases. Then you guys would probably start at the same time as them

[2022-12-28 16:58:35] <+LurtZwOw> it still took them 6 hours to kill it after the hotfix and they were qqing about it being oneshottable

[2022-12-28 16:58:40] <omgbewb> couse they had more eu ppl
[2022-12-28 16:58:41] <+zo0t3d> @mysterious_guy they nerfed last boss twice , once when echo was asleep once when liquid was asleep
[2022-12-28 16:58:45] <%almaster55> you guys were beasts
[2022-12-28 16:58:45] <Floody_IRL> were there many bosses that you got really crucial info on from seeing liquid kill first?
[2022-12-28 16:58:46] <psz90> liquid is instant dollars jr
[2022-12-28 16:58:46] <Brobi> It can be fair if nerf times are announced 24 hours in advance. This way both teams can work their schedules
[2022-12-28 16:58:47] <skyesarrow> Liquid got so many nerfs while you guys were raiding so I don’t know why people are upset
[2022-12-28 16:58:48] <aaron96_> the pull count seems irrelevant considering both guilds spent almost exactly the same amount of time on the boss
[2022-12-28 16:58:51] <jaysteea> it was cuz of the hotfix let you kill it if it was before no one would care
[2022-12-28 16:58:53] <Synarikz> next race all go to one location
[2022-12-28 16:58:55] <yppiable> you guys would still win even if you started at the same time after the hotfix, people gonna complain always
[2022-12-28 16:58:55] <%Shafther> Are people posting groups to level like this?
[2022-12-28 16:58:57] <harvanas> maybe because they were on the westcoast this time

[2022-12-28 16:59:02] <+its_hekks> @venyafaylei they do have global releases not global patches
[2022-12-28 16:59:05] <%+Ryu_Stream> They were trying to combat maintenance
[2022-12-28 16:59:06] <+ampho4> its gonna always be unfair for someone
[2022-12-28 16:59:12] <+zo0t3d> Do you think the nerf was a bit much though? Regardless of when it came out, do you think you could have did it without the nerf? @gingitv
[2022-12-28 16:59:17] <+SyMmBoLz> agree, i feel like they slept to much and slept later then usual. They also werent hungry like before to win and it was noticeable
[2022-12-28 16:59:20] <falldrgn> what was the nerf that caused the kill?
[2022-12-28 16:59:22] <+Anthy1887> I don't get why they started later that day, when they must have known Blizz will nerf it for europe (celebrating xmas on dec 24 etc.)
[2022-12-28 16:59:22] <kiraxd_tv> hey gingi i dont can play arkan fire o frost better?
[2022-12-28 16:59:23] <%+Corgi_Hunter> They didn't kill it instantly after the nerf.
[2022-12-28 16:59:25] <+jayd0t> but u were ahead already
[2022-12-28 16:59:27] <+Nerendis> Echo 2 pulls after hotfix. Liquid 5+ hours after hotfix. Reddit - “biassss”
[2022-12-28 16:59:30] <Dogbreath81> You were more efficient/better on Raszageth
[2022-12-28 16:59:36] <mrz_as> YEP
[2022-12-28 16:59:36] <%+johnny_nobody> yeah you guys were always ahead
[2022-12-28 16:59:37] <Klenet> yes but they get to start 1 day ahead too.. so
[2022-12-28 16:59:42] <%+W0nder87> u got home for XMAS in time ?
[2022-12-28 16:59:44] <konst185> was boss killable with 410 gear and without hotfix?
[2022-12-28 16:59:45] <%+MetrexGaming> Thing is they had quite a few tries after the nerf before killing it
[2022-12-28 16:59:46] <OhShetWaddup> of course it was deserved
[2022-12-28 16:59:47] <venyafaylei> Yeah @its_hekks I just mean global raid release with resets. Taht way Echo would probably start at the same time Liquid would and than the play ing field would basically be equal
[2022-12-28 16:59:48] <%+dNNar0L> specially that they had half a day headstart
[2022-12-28 16:59:49] <+LurtZwOw> @GingiTV if they one shot the boss after you guys then maybe that makes sense. since it took them forever to kill it after the nerf makes their argument irrelevant
[2022-12-28 16:59:52] <%aitonx> They we're too busy making jokes in pulls
[2022-12-28 16:59:53] <Weloxia> Yea well deserved 100%
[2022-12-28 16:59:55] <KeiNine_> Even after the nerf they still didn't one shot it like you did so I don't think it really mattered in the end
[2022-12-28 16:59:55] <+Tick427> Ofc you played better
[2022-12-28 16:59:56] <%+Dazdru> i think it should have been a draw! @GingiTV
[2022-12-28 16:59:56] <%MacGregor3> yeah wouldve like to have watched the race between the guilds post nerf
[2022-12-28 16:59:57] <+its_hekks> @gingitv don't feel bad... they slept like kings while you guys put in more work
[2022-12-28 17:00:00] <detalcell> with that pull u had on kill. nerf or not it was dead 100%
[2022-12-28 17:00:03] <Sniekiej> in the end u also got 100 pulls less on raza then everyone else
[2022-12-28 17:00:07] <+zo0t3d> @nerendis echo was already like 40 pulls into the fight when it got nerfed, getting to p3 isn’t just an easy thing to do
[2022-12-28 17:00:07] <Jacusi69> liquids p1 pulls weren't even clean

[2022-12-28 17:00:10] <sebby997> do you think it was actually killable pre hotfix?
[2022-12-28 17:00:26] <+zo0t3d> Do you think the nerf was a bit much though? Regardless of when it came out, do you think you could have did it without the nerf? @gingitv
[2022-12-28 17:00:26] <aaron96_> people keep arguing liquid didnt one shot after the boss have never progd a boss. You dont kill a boss you're progressing on the first pull of the day

[2022-12-28 17:00:41] <%almaster55> but CHRISTMAS!!
[2022-12-28 17:00:43] <+Masonxq> yea that woulda been a lot more entertaining for us, just unfortunate timing
[2022-12-28 17:00:47] <skyesarrow> I’m going to be real if the release of the raid was global I don’t think liquid would be close to some of these other guilds I think some of the Asian and even method would be ahead of them
[2022-12-28 17:00:47] <dino0n> Did you enjoy the race? Was the difficulty a good challenge? How do you feel mentally after so many pulls?

[2022-12-28 17:01:24] <Dogbreath81> Blizzard fucked up. None of the guilds fault.
[2022-12-28 17:01:24] <asennaoenn> @hansiiiiiu M+
[2022-12-28 17:01:27] <hazardFish> they nerfed bosses when they cam to their job places at morning
[2022-12-28 17:01:27] <+Deglund> bought 3 ELX that arrived yesterday. Time to become a real gamer
[2022-12-28 17:01:40] <+hansiiiiiu> thx
[2022-12-28 17:01:41] <+Appoc> The only way to fix that though is for blizz to take control of the RWF and set up a server for the guilds that want to participate
[2022-12-28 17:01:48] <mysterious_guy> but your nerf was on the last boss, their's not, thats the diff
[2022-12-28 17:01:49] <%+chaoskas> !ui
[2022-12-28 17:01:49] <@^Moobot> @chaoskas The new UI for Dragonflight has now been released! WA's for all specs, dungeons & raids will be coming soon. All Subscribers can now download it: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[2022-12-28 17:01:50] <STAIGZOR2> You diserved to win and would have won anyway and the nerfs were bullshit. Those 2 are not mutal exclusives
[2022-12-28 17:01:52] <%+Dazdru> Yeah it was shady, they should have been done when both were live to be fair.
[2022-12-28 17:01:54] <daniellxm33> in my opinion, blizz would neot hotfix the last phase if the Christmas wasnt happening the next day
[2022-12-28 17:01:56] <%+johnny_nobody> @GingiTV what do you think about doing it on a dedicated global tourney realm? I think the only issue would be "whos ping are we playing on?"
[2022-12-28 17:01:56] <doemelee> i mean still if they nerfed it when both of u were pulling. They still needed hours after the Nerf and you guys didnt
[2022-12-28 17:01:58] <%+kengiwoah> there was no perfect time, and everyone agrees echo deserved the win. should be left at that\
[2022-12-28 17:02:08] <teranda87> they wanted to be done before xmas
[2022-12-28 17:02:13] <kalleballe105> As long as its not a Xavius fight im entertained to watch it
[2022-12-28 17:02:14] <%Veng3ful> @mysterious_guy Bro of course Liquid got nerfs to P1 Intermission and stuff to Last boss when Echo was asleep
[2022-12-28 17:02:21] <sebby997> I have no idea how they shit the bed so much with this boss. How do you miss 50% on the adds and 50% on the shield?
[2022-12-28 17:02:25] <venyafaylei> Just release it for both regions at the same time. Its up to the players how much they care for their sleep schedule for the race to WF.
[2022-12-28 17:02:33] <Audi_6> tru
[2022-12-28 17:02:34] <+Anexros> if Echo hadn't downed the final boss would you have all been raiding on Christmas Day?

[2022-12-28 17:02:50] <+zo0t3d> @doemelee liquid just woke up , echo was pulling for hours and getting to p3  consistently , it was a p3 nerf that arguement means nothing
[2022-12-28 17:02:54] <+Sphexator> would be awesome
[2022-12-28 17:02:56] <%+johnny_nobody> agreed
[2022-12-28 17:02:57] <%+Drheer> it just feels like you two guilds are free testers for them for a global tuning for the majority of the people

[2022-12-28 17:02:57] <brysjes> It was multiple times on the last boss @mysterious_guy not just when liquid slept
[2022-12-28 17:03:01] <%+sinclsw23> exactly
[2022-12-28 17:03:02] <stormishftw> Liquid didnt kill right after nerf anyway..
[2022-12-28 17:03:10] <Synarikz> feel this
[2022-12-28 17:03:17] <%+bingbongsanchez22> true
[2022-12-28 17:03:18] <doemelee> @zo0t3d both had solid p3 pulls before tho
[2022-12-28 17:03:28] <%lingomate> i think the nerfs were for the viewers not the players
[2022-12-28 17:03:29] <+eyemyor> I dont get why people bitch ab out it.  Both guilds played out of their mind, and there is no shame for Liquid being 2nd.
[2022-12-28 17:03:34] <+GeeTV> NA are alpha-testers 👍

[2022-12-28 17:03:50] <Asselity> u wont have viewers to help u gear HC raids though

[2022-12-28 17:34:14] <FerdaHorde> I think Blizz should create a way to make it beneficial to have 1 of every class in every raid. Maybe a buff that you get only when a group has all classes. What do you think??

[2022-12-28 17:40:42] <@Lavochkin> @ryanchongle maybe but it will probably be via the in game store. since that mount is so much rarer :D but i do see the feldrake maybe coming to the in game store before they do anything with the spectral tiger :D

[2022-12-28 18:15:11] <Togec1> other bosses tuning (like dathea) was WAY out of whack
[2022-12-28 18:15:13] <%unholyhoit> nah, if Liquid wanted to they could have been awake, you were waking up at 5 in the morning some days @GingiTV
[2022-12-28 18:15:33] <%FlowdiTV> KEKW
[2022-12-28 18:15:35] <Felric_DH> thats what happens when they dont test end boss on beta
[2022-12-28 18:15:37] <deeskicks> @unholyhoit I thought it was strange they didn’t play til noon some days
[2022-12-28 18:15:41] <%+Badziee> not tested at all I guess. only tested in theory...
[2022-12-28 18:15:42] <ThermalGeist> thinking they teste KEKW
[2022-12-28 18:15:45] <thanthan7> what's the DPS comp for your m+ pushing?
[2022-12-28 18:15:49] <NightmaresAsylum> they put an artificial block in so no guild could complain for it to be killed too early, it is that easy
[2022-12-28 18:15:50] <IAttackYou> the race was garbage, you guys and liquid fucking owned, the boss just was ass
[2022-12-28 18:15:52] <IAttackYou> it wasnt even hard
[2022-12-28 18:15:52] <Togec1> they're not paying people to wake them up if they announce a boss nerf KEKW @unholyhoit
[2022-12-28 18:15:53] <%+ToonTheKid> Blizzard employee's are just better than you guys @GingiTV
[2022-12-28 18:15:54] <%unholyhoit> @deeskicks probably pulling off stream
[2022-12-28 18:15:54] <IAttackYou> it was just tuning
[2022-12-28 18:15:56] <IAttackYou> so stupid
[2022-12-28 18:15:56] <Hallibell365> tested and added a zero to everything
[2022-12-28 18:16:08] <trexxustv> @GingiTV so u are saying that acually world 1st went to blizzard testing team? :D:D:D
[2022-12-28 18:16:09] <Felric_DH> well its a new xpac with new systems, so they had no other data to go off of i guess for tuning the end boss
[2022-12-28 18:16:09] <flippityfiloppity> @GingiTV did u get home in time for christmas?
[2022-12-28 18:16:14] <Mindfull> imo they don't even test stuff like that. It's so sad, after so many great raids and fights, seeing this shit

[2022-12-28 18:17:01] <trexxustv> @GingiTV no u cant blame that on that, they hotfixed it at 9am US time, with means they just oversleept, dont make excuses for not putting enouch into RWF from their side...
[2022-12-28 18:17:01] <%unholyhoit> yeah they went hard nerfing the last phase, they'll probably nerf it 20 more times before most guilds get to it
[2022-12-28 18:17:07] <%+frypster> killing the nerfed boss took liquid also hours though... echo was just better and much more efficient
[2022-12-28 18:17:12] <+Sathyron> i mean they were so much behind. You did oneshot it after the hotfix and they still took 3h + and before hotfix they where only at 14%
[2022-12-28 18:17:16] <Hallibell365> so actually blizz got world first?
[2022-12-28 18:17:25] <%unholyhoit> @Togec1 is it true that Echo woke up at 5 in the morning?
[2022-12-28 18:17:52] <%+soflyah> they start later cause maitenance timing i thought
[2022-12-28 18:17:54] <IAttackYou> im more hyped watching you guys push some keys
[2022-12-28 18:17:56] <+Lockful> Didn’t they have maintenance if they started earlier
[2022-12-28 18:17:57] <%+Badziee> time for global release!!!
[2022-12-28 18:18:01] <Joniio> liquid still wiped for 3 hours after they come online then so dident matter
[2022-12-28 18:18:05] <+wellhyper> why dont you just move to NA or get liquid to move the EU.
[2022-12-28 18:18:07] <trexxustv> @GingiTV there is no but, they fuced up, they seen u were close, u on the other hand woke up at 5am 1 day, and especially at the end u decide to start raid 11am/ cmon bruh, u deserved the win

[2022-12-28 18:21:53] <+drittfolk> imagine the servers get bricked so hard if releases are during primetime when theyre fucked at midnight

[2022-12-28 18:22:02] <itsFrost11> isnt there some technical reasons behind doing resets on seperate days
[2022-12-28 18:22:06] <p1km4nd> LeveL?
[2022-12-28 18:22:13] <%unholyhoit> Why is cross realm disabled for Mythic raids at all?
[2022-12-28 18:22:21] <%MennyhunterTV> @p1km4nd 68
[2022-12-28 18:22:29] <MidnightSlicez> Raid comes out 6pm est no?
[2022-12-28 18:22:30] <ChumbaWumba6943> i think the only reason they won't change eu maintenance days to be same as na's is because if there's a problem the whole game would be down for both regions and they would get flak for that
[2022-12-28 18:22:34] <Farmerick> @GingiTV its more about work hours in EU
[2022-12-28 18:22:42] <Zoledraiin> we would haver server shut down and maintainance in the middle of the day
[2022-12-28 18:22:44] <+Sathyron> it would obviously be better for everyone but people love to hate on the EVIL WF RAIDERS KEKW
[2022-12-28 18:22:46] <Wardoggydogg> is would affect casusals because before a realease servers go down for maintence?
[2022-12-28 18:22:54] <Audi_6> i think they probably dislike the reset time, but doesn't seem like a good enough reason
[2022-12-28 18:22:59] VIEWERS: 6 081
[2022-12-28 18:23:01] <mazerko_> they can do maintenance whenever and then have the reset happen globally anyway tho
[2022-12-28 18:23:04] <%+blodfight96> what lvl are you?
[2022-12-28 18:23:05] <+wellhyper> servers would be down most of the day
[2022-12-28 18:23:09] <%+Bennodkk> servers cant handle getting  released at primetime they are already so fucked
[2022-12-28 18:23:10] <areyoudrunkorwhat> because servers on Na and if any problem occours they need to fix it in daytime
[2022-12-28 18:23:13] <%unholyhoit> @Farmerick the game release is global and it's fine?
[2022-12-28 18:23:14] <mazerko_> the resets dont have to be tied to the maintenance times
[2022-12-28 18:23:14] <tyglisa> Those guys dont work nightshift :D
[2022-12-28 18:23:18] <+Sathyron> exactly
[2022-12-28 18:23:18] <xfanger_> NA raid maintenance is for like 8 hours
[2022-12-28 18:23:23] <@Lavochkin> that was negivatily effect your race to world first 70? becuase more people on and bigger que and they would need to work a lot harder on their servers.
[2022-12-28 18:23:24] <Kotodama1> nightshift people probably wanna play
[2022-12-28 18:23:35] <@%GLOCKXWORK> Mike, they're a small indie company. Relax with the CRAZY demands. gingiMonkaS
[2022-12-28 18:23:40] <Eskavari> but that maintenance problem is like 2 times per year, why would that matter
[2022-12-28 18:23:41] <Adorno1903> would you totally change your sleeping schedule if it would release on na times? or just go to bed like normal?
[2022-12-28 18:23:43] <ChumbaWumba6943> and surely they could have it so the raid opens at a later time and not just with maintenance? like "enable" the raid on a friday or something
[2022-12-28 18:23:45] <POGGAROOSREVENGE> If they can launch an expansion on the same time for EU and NA , there's no argument why they cant do it for a raid LUL
[2022-12-28 18:23:54] <%unholyhoit> and you can have NA people remotely doing maintenance on EU servers KEKW
[2022-12-28 18:23:59] <+deadjazzyl> What class tuning would you like to see now the race is over?
[2022-12-28 18:23:59] <+Sneaky_Snacks> thoughts on doing top guilds are on a seperate realm together like MDI?
[2022-12-28 18:24:00] <trexxustv> @GingiTV u do realise if EU was the 1st one to get it released then there is not really a race? as they would be so far away... they were 100 pulls more and 1 day ahead, and even after hotfix it took them 4hours to finish it... look backwards aswell what happened at end of last raid etc.. the only reason they are close is because they are 12h ahead... :D:D:D
[2022-12-28 18:24:17] <+Byytet> what do you think of cross faction guilds
[2022-12-28 18:24:17] <+Waltinho> they do that in classic currently. Maintenances are on tuesday and wednesday as usual for NA and EU, and then raid releases globally on thursday
[2022-12-28 18:24:20] <Farmerick> @unholyhoit its just one day , every 2 years , no tthe same , every day each week
[2022-12-28 18:24:26] <+Danskis30> do you know why group finder is not working after installing any addon ?
[2022-12-28 18:24:27] <NightmaresAsylum> @trexxustv this
[2022-12-28 18:24:39] <%unholyhoit> No one works at the office at Blizzard, they can have US workers do EU maintenance @GingiTV
[2022-12-28 18:24:40] <%+TJdps> thatt has to be a troll lol

[2022-12-28 18:24:56] <+wellhyper> both guilds will be progressing and not just copying each other
[2022-12-28 18:24:58] <%+Dazdru> The pull count was solely down to pre-hotfixes mostly

[2022-12-28 18:25:14] <+fresh_mojo> which does happen like every race
[2022-12-28 18:25:17] <Kotodama1> would make sense for global release even more then. everyone play with bugs.

[2022-12-28 22:26:23] <hadeuuz> it made puging alot worse
[2022-12-28 22:26:33] <riptide_92> Loot feels bad. I am not a good player. So I did for on 7 chars. Got like 1 iteam on them
[2022-12-28 22:26:39] <%+manuellsen_hash> Just go only leader and only one in your tier still fine i think
[2022-12-28 22:26:42] <%lovetopwnubs> When catalyst coming out?
[2022-12-28 22:26:42] <MILEEES> before you could just stack classes and get way more loot for your class
[2022-12-28 22:26:48] <mikkelmalmros> What do you use for target swapping when you've bound tab for something else?
[2022-12-28 22:26:52] <+joeg433> @lovetopwnubs the 23rd
[2022-12-28 22:26:54] <reggiepowa> why is pug loot worse than personal loot, you can actually get multiple items from 1 boss now

[2022-12-28 22:27:00] <die_sumpfranze22> @dotello_ it does, because irrelevant loot can drop, so it punishes smaller groups that might not have all classes etc.
[2022-12-28 22:27:05] <DependableDane> the only reason why the catalysts are so far away is due to them not wanting us to complete all content in a couple of weeks keeping the subs rolling :D
[2022-12-28 22:27:06] <soulrage> did you get anything from the raid? on the rogue
[2022-12-28 22:27:38] <killswitch941> ive only had 1 bit of loot in 2 raids on my monk
[2022-12-28 22:28:04] <justw8> so what you're saying, is that you cant cheat the system anymore
[2022-12-28 22:28:05] <dimberg> what if blizzard removed tier from raid drops and had catalyst from the beginning but giving one item per week so that it takes 4 weeks for everyone, would give most people tier earlier and take away alot of the splits for us that loves watching rwf
[2022-12-28 22:28:05] <reggiepowa> I think class stacking sucks, it's better to incentivize varied groups
