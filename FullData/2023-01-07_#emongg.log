[2023-01-07 16:48:04] <+Kettlez> @blueeberrymuffins18 flicking, tracking, and microadjustments are three core fundimentals of aiming, if you need to reduce this use an aim trainer like aim labs, mindfully practice the different techniques an deepbed it into your muscle memory

[2023-01-07 17:01:07] <fwankey> @BurritoMedia who cares. it's just for the event
[2023-01-07 17:01:07] <s7bika> i dont understand, how hog uses sigma's rock ?

[2023-01-07 18:12:09] <+riveyrock7> What should I be thinking about while playing overwatch? I often feel I’m playing without thinking about anything
[2023-01-07 18:12:09] <%fireblazewolf420> I have good positioning. Sometimes I get tunnle vison if I'm winning a team fight. and I'll wind up getting killed

[2023-01-07 18:12:16] <sleepycatloaf> HYPERYump
[2023-01-07 18:12:25] <senpaiarmiegeddon> but like if my supports were good and only focused on me, I wouldn't have to worry about "position"
[2023-01-07 18:12:25] <%Culein_> yeah as a healer is important to have good positioning
[2023-01-07 18:12:30] <%+wisteria_rose> @blondejohn96 or going 1vs 1 against a ulting soldier emongEZ
[2023-01-07 18:12:32] <+TheThreadWeaver> Making an adjustment also isn't a linear growth thing. Humans relapse behavior, so growth requires you to recognize when you're relapsing and gradually decreasing those relapses too.
[2023-01-07 18:12:36] <%blondejohn96> yeah positioning is most important for healers

[2023-01-07 18:33:44] <%greg0409> I enjoy push because of how back and forth it is
[2023-01-07 18:33:45] <fuji9021> anti-nade is destroying you
[2023-01-07 18:33:45] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-07 18:33:45] <%+tm_901> i think they just need to add another mode because you get sick of push if you play it too much
[2023-01-07 18:33:48] <jonahdabonah25> What was buffed for her cuz I tried her a few days ago and I did so fricking good
[2023-01-07 18:34:01] <%fireblazewolf420> the ana is super aggressive

[2023-01-07 18:34:14] <Dubby_OW> id rather play push 24/7 than 2cp
[2023-01-07 18:34:22] <%greg0409> @tm_901 This OR remove map pools. It feels like push is more common because there are like 0 other maps in rotation. Ive ONLY gotten than new payload map twice... in total
[2023-01-07 18:34:22] <%+Azure_Az> @jonahdabonah25 if yuou go to menu there is a patch notes section with everything
[2023-01-07 18:34:26] <honomu> @honomu always goes the full 10 minutes cause you basically need to puss the bot into their spawn doors

[2023-01-07 18:34:30] <+tbhayward> @jonahdabonah25 If someone with a dot on them dies she consumes the remaining hot. For every person she hits with her axe the cooldown is reduced by 2s. Her knife has an extra 30 hp hot now

[2023-01-07 18:35:09] <jonahdabonah25> @tbhayward What’s hot
[2023-01-07 18:35:13] <+tbhayward> heal over time

[2023-01-07 18:35:30] <seaskythe> kinda lacking heals
[2023-01-07 18:35:32] <%+tm_901> the game has left emongg speechless
[2023-01-07 18:35:35] <%greg0409> @tm_901 While I'd prefer the no map pools, but another gamemode could be fun and exciting. I vote for Siege from paladins :)

[2023-01-07 18:36:58] <sarcastic212> @Hawk_I_Gaming blue is shield and regens without healing
[2023-01-07 18:36:59] <%+tm_901> @Hawk_I_Gaming its shield
[2023-01-07 18:37:00] <%WolfIsBad_> @Hawk_I_Gaming blue is shields, white is health. shields regen over time if not taking damage
[2023-01-07 18:37:06] <+TheThreadWeaver> Lucio tried to jump their ana and died. rip.
[2023-01-07 18:37:11] <butterstubs> Your lucio hasn't been on you periodddd
[2023-01-07 18:37:12] <Dubby_OW> @Hawk_I_Gaming you mean blue healthbar? thats called a shield health, it regenerates itself after 3s of not taking dmg
[2023-01-07 18:37:16] <TheBFB> why isn''t that anna dead

[2023-01-07 18:39:28] <+TheThreadWeaver> Lucio wasn't useless, but they did have a different game plan from the rest of the team and failed to recognize it.
[2023-01-07 18:39:29] <Ring127> Did they seriously say tank diff when their team had two pockets the entire time?
[2023-01-07 18:39:31] <%iliketoeatpineapples> didn't know that rose also play other dps other than widow LUL

[2023-01-07 18:39:43] <%WolfIsBad_> @ItBeMeNoah yours is about normal. sens is all personal preference tbh. i use lower than you but i prefer it lower, i know people that use way higher
[2023-01-07 18:39:43] <hosslinor> your teammates struggled so  badly in that game and the other team just sat in JQ's lap all game

[2023-01-07 18:39:48] <powderpoprocks> 11 deaths for your lucio omg?
[2023-01-07 18:39:51] <JinTechD> The other queen was doing better because they had 2 supports vs just 1
[2023-01-07 18:39:52] <xemptt_t> Typical lucio one trick
[2023-01-07 18:40:00] <%Culein_> yeah that lucio was a bad healer that match
[2023-01-07 18:40:00] <%greg0409> I think if you had your lucio with you it wouldve been much easier to play
[2023-01-07 18:40:04] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @Ring127 life of a tank LUL
[2023-01-07 18:40:06] <+Hawk_I_Gaming> @WolfIsBad_ okay so is it better to have health over shield in a fight? either way your still holdig holding the 250 HP right?
[2023-01-07 18:40:07] <ItBeMeNoah> @WolfIsBad_ Ah okay, wasn't sure if myne was considered low or what relative to others ty for info

[2023-01-07 18:40:52] <%greg0409> I imagine lucio with a JQ can be fantastic, especially with the Carnage buff. You just speed into the whole team and spam it lol
[2023-01-07 18:40:54] <%WolfIsBad_> @Hawk_I_Gaming mid fight it doesnt matter, it only matters for post fight or pre fight. but shields are hero exclusive so dont look too much into it

[2023-01-07 18:41:34] <%WolfIsBad_> @ItBeMeNoah it also depends alot on what heroes you play as well. tank players and genji players tend to have higher sens to be able to look around faster, but hitscans tend to have lower to be more precise
[2023-01-07 18:41:35] <%jet4sale> I got the Rein title card for the event, that was a treat

[2023-01-07 18:52:28] <Dubby_OW> my guess about axe being slow, is to create counterplay vs aoe bleed
[2023-01-07 18:52:30] <%chompchomp8> I can't believe it doesn't break trap

[2023-01-07 18:52:50] <+EricGridlock> make axe do as much damage as genji blade

[2023-01-07 18:53:09] <Strattekun> @EricGridlock I think it does more if you include the bleed
[2023-01-07 18:53:17] <%chompchomp8> @ericgridlock it literally does more damage including the bleed
[2023-01-07 18:53:20] <honomu> i think if JQ ult and rein charge collide it should at least stun them both instead of JQ getting pinned lol

[2023-01-07 18:55:20] <+EricGridlock> day 2 of asking @emongg if hed rather have 100 dollars or a taste of diet Dr. Kelp
[2023-01-07 18:55:20] <%samepuddle> i think her animations with the mythic skin just make her even better to play she is my go to in QP since itsa tough for me to play her in compo
[2023-01-07 18:55:26] <+Topshot_246> Wouldnt she counter winston?
[2023-01-07 18:55:31] <+VentusWK> @montmorenncy as a support main, Brig's always been the best support at playing around teams who are super split and playing all over the place b/c of how big the range of inspire and health pack are.
[2023-01-07 18:55:34] <%+omnideoist> i really enjoy how orisa counters basically every other tank
[2023-01-07 18:55:39] <+mrchez0910> Personally I think junker queen is a dps with good health
[2023-01-07 18:55:40] <kingtswasey> she can purple hog if he has no cleanse, but almost every tank can boop her out of her ult
[2023-01-07 18:56:00] <%N30NxL1T3x> there is no fun MrDestructoid only meta
[2023-01-07 18:56:00] <estorko> do you think ramatra is broken in comp ? @Emongg
[2023-01-07 18:56:03] <Dubby_OW> JQ wont be an actual meta, as long as kiriko is in this state imo
[2023-01-07 18:56:08] <Dubby_OW> hard counter to her ult
[2023-01-07 18:56:09] <ba3watch> Do you think there needs to be some dmg reduction to some heroes? like soujourn?
[2023-01-07 18:56:11] <%Nennai> peepoSit
[2023-01-07 18:56:13] <the_mochi_man> Hey
[2023-01-07 18:56:21] <gold_necrozma> @emongg did they make u slower In nemesis form?
[2023-01-07 18:56:21] <%blondejohn96> there is no fun, only zool
[2023-01-07 18:56:24] <Dubby_OW> rammy is fun
[2023-01-07 18:56:26] <+ya_boy_george> orisa is broken af
[2023-01-07 18:56:28] <Spannondorf> Junker Queen not being a counter to anything I think is honestly a good design for the game
[2023-01-07 18:56:40] <ncap5> Where’s sully
[2023-01-07 18:56:42] <Spannondorf> weren't they trying to get away from counters?
[2023-01-07 18:56:43] <Dubby_OW> that speed boost he gets on nemesis is a game changer
[2023-01-07 18:56:44] <+mikayladotexe> is it just me or do you say ramattra with such a boston accent
[2023-01-07 18:56:46] <IsyBlaze> right, there should be no hard counters
[2023-01-07 18:56:48] <+carlton_bros> who is your go to pick
[2023-01-07 18:56:54] <%N30NxL1T3x> @blondejohn96 what's a zool HypeHuh
[2023-01-07 18:56:55] <Dubby_OW> it boost both your attack and your juking ability
[2023-01-07 18:56:57] <%greg0409> @Spannondorf Agreed, nothing should be designed as a "counter" to something else
[2023-01-07 18:56:58] <+Sturdy_Nips> Is Brig good finally?

[2023-01-07 18:57:15] <+aaymon86> I think if Hog and Orisa get nerfed, he'll be next in line as the number 1 tank
[2023-01-07 18:57:18] <estorko> what's his best counter ?
[2023-01-07 18:57:18] <Dubby_OW> brig can suk my ballz YEP
[2023-01-07 18:57:18] <%greg0409> @Sturdy_Nips The buff she got honestly does nothing
[2023-01-07 18:57:22] <+Sturdy_Nips> Good point bruddha
[2023-01-07 18:57:22] <+VentusWK> I don't think the big issue with brig was ever the shield health
[2023-01-07 18:57:24] <%+tm_901> its a good buff for every other situation though
[2023-01-07 18:57:26] <!%$Vent_YeahManThatsCool> KEKW blondie
[2023-01-07 18:57:26] <AstroElio> Who’s ur go to tank then?
[2023-01-07 18:57:27] <%jet4sale> in brigs favour :)
[2023-01-07 18:57:27] <+I_TeKneeK> What’s your take on HOG, and his rework incoming?
[2023-01-07 18:57:28] <billsirius> I feel ppl just don’t know how to counter ram’s ult
[2023-01-07 18:57:29] <honomu> ramranch is quite strong on payload maps especially in overtime situations
[2023-01-07 18:57:29] <watermalown> mei ram lucio is actually scary. they just run at you KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:57:30] <kingtswasey> you're suffering as he has
[2023-01-07 18:57:31] <Spannondorf> she can take half an extra step dude what's the problem?
[2023-01-07 18:57:32] <%chompchomp8> I think jq will be good against hog after the rework because what messes up the jq hog duel rn is hog just 2 taps jq
[2023-01-07 18:57:32] <+cannabou> he punches right thru too
[2023-01-07 18:57:32] <0ghostpunch0> smoothly, ez win KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:57:32] <victorjua14> They shpuild have buffed her health also
[2023-01-07 18:57:33] <%greg0409> Im fine with Brig being bad, she had her time in the spotlight
[2023-01-07 18:57:37] <%blondejohn96> i am the keymaster Vent_YeahManThatsCool
[2023-01-07 18:57:39] <gold_necrozma> 450 hp. pls! nemesis form punch goes through sheild
[2023-01-07 18:57:43] <Dubby_OW> play brig for double shield comp KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:57:45] <%+tm_901> you have 500 effective hp now potentially
[2023-01-07 18:57:45] <montmorenncy> they need to rush her new ult
[2023-01-07 18:57:48] <%+tm_901> she can basically offtank
[2023-01-07 18:57:57] <ba3watch> @Emongg soujourn nerf when? lol
[2023-01-07 18:57:58] <lucas46g> Jq still doesn’t offer much for the team since shout nerfs, I think they should bring shout back to 100 health but keep 3 sec Duration so it is a quick reaction tool
[2023-01-07 18:57:59] <+carlton_bros> who is your go to pick
[2023-01-07 18:58:02] <%PusheenPlush> i had a game where my orisa refused to leave ram's ult and both supports were just pumping her with heals and it went on for fucking ever
[2023-01-07 18:58:03] <%N30NxL1T3x> remember brig 1.0 good times emongComfy
[2023-01-07 18:58:05] <!%$Vent_YeahManThatsCool> @blondejohn96 I don’t want to be the gatekeeper….
[2023-01-07 18:58:12] <honomu> i think ramranch can sometimes be a little dependent on his ult to win fights
[2023-01-07 18:58:13] <JAYZENtheWalker> cool skin
[2023-01-07 18:58:13] <%AGL0ve> the meta in lower Elo is healbot a Ulting Blocking Ramantra And its so fun
[2023-01-07 18:58:17] <%chompchomp8> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-07 18:58:17] <Dubby_OW> maybe brig buff was to allow her block more dmg in 1v1 vs flankers
[2023-01-07 18:58:18] <+dookieshoes93> Waddup fellow gamers! Happy weekend
[2023-01-07 18:58:19] <Dubby_OW> like tracer

[2023-01-07 18:58:20] <AstroElio> So who’s ur go to tank?
[2023-01-07 18:58:20] <Peekiimon> She is super squishy D:
[2023-01-07 18:58:23] <+HueyLewisFan> yeah brigs biggest problem is that she has trouble existing still
[2023-01-07 18:58:24] <%samepuddle> ayyy lets get it JQ
[2023-01-07 18:58:26] <Spannondorf> I think brig should be one of those low ELO healers. she was top tier for too long
[2023-01-07 18:58:27] <+Sturdy_Nips> @N30NxL1T3x I do it was sweeet
[2023-01-07 18:58:28] <%blondejohn96> oh sure, i suppose you wanna be gozer as always Vent_YeahManThatsCool

[2023-01-07 18:58:34] <honomu> ramranch is pretty fun on this map too
[2023-01-07 18:58:36] <%greg0409> @Dubby_OW More than likely this
[2023-01-07 18:58:36] <%+tm_901> 500 effective hp that all recharges is very good on the backline though
[2023-01-07 18:58:39] <%stonybolone> hello cutie chat
[2023-01-07 18:58:44] <victorjua14> i think her health should be 250, even maybe going to 300 because she has to play close
[2023-01-07 18:58:45] <watermalown> 50 more shield hp for charging sojorn rail :)
[2023-01-07 18:58:45] <lucas46g> @emongg Jq still doesn’t offer much for the team since shout nerfs, I think they should bring shout back to 100 health but keep 3 sec Duration so it is a quick reaction tool

[2023-01-07 18:58:51] <%N30NxL1T3x> @sturdy_nips she had her one jumbo health pack

[2023-01-07 18:59:08] <!%$Vent_YeahManThatsCool> Yes
[2023-01-07 18:59:08] <+zombiesgosplat> brig gets smoked by most of the tanks cuz they all have abilities or ultimates or their gun just hits through shields
[2023-01-07 18:59:13] <Dubby_OW> @2bitmel hell nah, she had 250 before and she was fucking brooooooken
[2023-01-07 18:59:26] <Dubby_OW> 25 health changes so much, youve seen what zen could do before
[2023-01-07 18:59:28] <lucas46g> Being good vs orisa?
[2023-01-07 18:59:29] <Spannondorf> a lot of things ignore barriers
[2023-01-07 18:59:32] <+aaymon86> I usually poke with him till they engage or I engage.
[2023-01-07 18:59:34] <montmorenncy> she needs her stun back
[2023-01-07 18:59:37] <+mikayladotexe> sick throw
[2023-01-07 18:59:39] <vang4220> are you getting drops from this stream
[2023-01-07 18:59:42] <%greg0409> @2bitmel That was also brig with a stun
[2023-01-07 18:59:46] <!%$Vent_YeahManThatsCool> Hog has 2.5k effective HP
[2023-01-07 18:59:47] <kingtswasey> YepKnife

[2023-01-07 18:59:58] <%Nennai> !trap
[2023-01-07 18:59:58] <@%^StreamElements> WHY IS THERE A TRAP HERE? Emongg has stepped in a random trap 1357 times.
[2023-01-07 18:59:59] <Strattekun> !trap
[2023-01-07 18:59:59] <honomu> @honomu agree but if the fight goes on for longer than 8 seconds you'll be hurting
[2023-01-07 19:00:00] <%greg0409> @Vent_YeahManThatsCool Hogs effective HP is infinite
[2023-01-07 19:00:08] <+plushcap> it reminds me of the OW1 rein buffs described by flats as "now yuo can suffer a second longer"
[2023-01-07 19:00:11] <Dubby_OW> ow1 launch brig shield was 600 hp and could stun though shields KEKW also her E was an insta heal
[2023-01-07 19:00:14] <vang4220> thanks
[2023-01-07 19:00:15] <victorjua14> brig should have 250 health and her shield bash and whip proctor inspire without the inspire cooldown
[2023-01-07 19:00:15] <Strattekun> Hog is the center of the universe
[2023-01-07 19:00:22] <%+tm_901> i mean by the same logic all support have infinite effective hp though
[2023-01-07 19:00:33] <%greg0409> @tm_901 Exactly KEKW
[2023-01-07 19:00:40] <%Nennai> ^ KEKW
[2023-01-07 19:00:47] <%stonybolone> just got a neck crack that made me emongGasm
[2023-01-07 19:00:47] <$quickbats> The knife impact damage nerf is really felt though
[2023-01-07 19:00:54] <%+tm_901> but how much you'll get in a 1v1 for example is different
[2023-01-07 19:00:58] <combos4fn> I have a question. Does OW have cross progression if I make an account for a family member on ps4 and then log in from PC?

[2023-01-07 19:01:20] <%greg0409> @combos4fn You have to have the account linked to the same BNET account, but then yes
[2023-01-07 19:01:21] <honomu> whoa JQ in kiriko ult
[2023-01-07 19:01:25] <Dubby_OW> @combos4fn yes, you can crossplay and cross progress
[2023-01-07 19:01:38] <+Ninjipp0> @combos4fn I think u can migrate ur stuff now but its not cross progression

[2023-01-07 19:02:07] <+aaymon86> The ult needs a buff for sure tho.  It's so underwhelming.
[2023-01-07 19:02:08] <combos4fn> Yeah I just wanna make an acc for my sister on ps4 and then log in to her account on PC
[2023-01-07 19:02:17] <%Rapierman> How about a tier list using each hero against every other hero?
[2023-01-07 19:02:25] <+zombiesgosplat> I save bash to bash out to live longer... brig is so fragile you can't really play aggressive unless you got rally
[2023-01-07 19:02:26] <Dubby_OW> idk how battlepass works on crossplay tho
[2023-01-07 19:02:27] <%+tm_901> @combos4fn its essentially the same account after merge
[2023-01-07 19:02:34] <+aaymon86> And he heal packs could use a faster cooldown
[2023-01-07 19:02:37] <Dubby_OW> like if u buy pass on console you might not have it on pc
[2023-01-07 19:02:37] <+aaymon86> her*
[2023-01-07 19:02:42] <gold_necrozma> @emongg would u say jq meta?
[2023-01-07 19:02:50] <%greg0409> @Dubby_OW I can check right now
[2023-01-07 19:02:51] <Strattekun> new Brig ult just puts her in Rein's armor
[2023-01-07 19:02:53] <vernpwns> @rapierman that would be a huge list 😄

[2023-01-07 19:03:01] <!blizz_winter> For me, Brig is more about what the enemy is playing than what heroes my team is playing.

[2023-01-07 19:03:36] <coolruahh> whats this guys rank?
[2023-01-07 19:03:38] <Dubby_OW> she feels useless outside of antidive
[2023-01-07 19:03:43] <%greg0409> I think brigs ult needs a change, not a buff. Since it was proven how strong giving armor is
[2023-01-07 19:03:45] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-07 19:03:49] <luazri> if the meta was like dive, with winton or dva I think Brig will feel better
[2023-01-07 19:03:49] <+HueyLewisFan> brigs fun and okay, shes just so much less good than the rest of the supports it feels. i get flamed more for picking brig than picking ball these days
[2023-01-07 19:03:50] <Dubby_OW> she might sometimes work in brawl, very rarely, lucio is just better

[2023-01-07 19:05:45] <JawaFilms> are they giving brig a new ult or just tweaking the current one
[2023-01-07 19:05:47] <%greg0409> @Dubby_OW The problem with that is if it doesnt work, it REALLY doesnt work. Its a huge commitment

[2023-01-07 19:09:31] <%greg0409> @Dubby_OW can confirm, if you buy the battlepass on console, you also have it on PC. Its the same account so it makes sense

[2023-01-07 19:10:13] <Dubby_OW> @greg0409 yeah right, thats because you can buy the pass on the browser outside the game too, it just goes on the account, not platform, makes sense
[2023-01-07 19:10:14] <%+tm_901> the worst thing about the new comms is when i say 'group up' to my solo diving dps and it says 'im with you'

[2023-01-07 19:13:10] <%SkitzoCTRL> Here's an idea for the ping system: remove it for anybody sub-Diamond because it's not like anybody below that even looks at pings. :p

[2023-01-07 19:13:30] <%WolfIsBad_> @Nennai i think if you look at the objective and ping it says "attack/defend the objective"

[2023-01-07 19:50:01] <urbanned1> @TheNastyFridge check what? The japanese VA i think has done some animes as well
[2023-01-07 19:50:13] <ladino2020> any tips for a Orisa tank main to be
[2023-01-07 19:50:17] <%+Powder_14> @homeycomb It’s not possible to balance any game
[2023-01-07 19:50:18] <%$TheNastyFridge> @TheNastyFridge The IMDB entry, before you argue the point
[2023-01-07 19:50:26] <ohohlu> most balanced in ow2 rn?
[2023-01-07 19:50:34] <%$andrewoverkill> i liked the 2022 video! just watched, cant believe we are in 2023 now
[2023-01-07 19:50:44] <%$TheNastyFridge> I'm saying the entry is weird because it has two VA entries for Kiriko without any specification, and Kiriko is the only one who has those
[2023-01-07 19:50:49] <%Presarius712> there was a time in ow1 where everyone thought the game was balanced pretty well. then the devs decided to buff/nerf unnecessary heroes
[2023-01-07 19:50:50] <siwsiwit> do we really need to buy the battlepass to get semettra?
[2023-01-07 19:50:57] <%$TheNastyFridge> I can see why this would lead someone to assume she has two voice actors in the English version
[2023-01-07 19:51:05] <oddd0ne> kirikos eng and jpn voices are def different
[2023-01-07 19:51:05] <sleepycatloaf> @Emongg Have you played the battle for Olympus game mode? Cause it would be fun to see you play it! hdesWiggle hdesNice
[2023-01-07 19:51:09] <%Presarius712> sig and ram are well balanced imo
[2023-01-07 19:51:11] <%Nennai> @siwsiwit no, you can get him for free by reaching lvl 45
[2023-01-07 19:51:13] <%puff4me> How old is your cat?

[2023-01-07 19:51:24] <%Homeycomb> I only ask because it seems like thats what people are asking for
[2023-01-07 19:51:25] <honomu> ):
[2023-01-07 19:51:33] <Novaxblader> @Emongg I really want to get good with sig but I just feel like I can never impact the game on him
[2023-01-07 19:51:45] <LilMomochii> i think orisa is also a balanced tank
[2023-01-07 19:51:45] <siwsiwit> @nennai tnx bro just starred playing ow mb
[2023-01-07 19:51:47] <ow_sigmaeats> @emongg is flats takin a break
[2023-01-07 19:51:47] <urbanned1> @TheNastyFridge oh, who knows ApuApustaja I meant that hanzo and genji especially have other VA's for japanese, I think it's a blizzard contract or w/e
[2023-01-07 19:51:47] <Zeta1990> Is he muted?
[2023-01-07 19:51:47] <IamToadTickler> whats your off stream go to game?
[2023-01-07 19:51:52] <%+CryroOfficial> Nova the shield placement is key

[2023-01-07 19:52:05] <%+sylphrena94> @Novaxblader Gotta learn to hit those rocks better and aim his primary fire by bouncing them off walls and such
[2023-01-07 19:52:06] <%+Techative> @sleepycatloaf he played it earlier this stream, he was mainly playing JQ
[2023-01-07 19:52:09] <%$TheNastyFridge> @oddd0ne Mhm no, in the English version of the game, it's the same actress for both the Japanese and the English voice lines, but the IMDB entry is weird
[2023-01-07 19:52:31] <HobbitSlayer> like the same orissa/hog every game
[2023-01-07 19:52:32] <sleepycatloaf> @Techative Ok thanks! Dang I missed it LUL
[2023-01-07 19:52:36] <ladino2020> @emongg tips for an Orisa main?
[2023-01-07 19:52:36] <honomu> the game feels more balanced if you learn each meta instead of trying to force the characters you like imo
[2023-01-07 19:52:43] <oddd0ne> @TheNastyFridge they sound like different people to me :)
[2023-01-07 19:52:45] <%denniixx> op heroes can be fun, but not for 2-3 months

[2023-01-07 19:53:26] <%+Techative> @sleepycatloaf yeah, he'll probably play it again as a warm up, you can also go back after stream and watch the vod
[2023-01-07 19:53:28] <+ixmiramarxx> how is ranked treating you
[2023-01-07 19:53:29] <SethhhEl> Hey emongg
[2023-01-07 19:53:29] <%TheGreekSpeedster> 6v6 was so bad

[2023-01-07 19:53:32] <%$TheNastyFridge> @oddd0ne People can sound different when they speak different languages, maybe that's what is at play there emongHmm
[2023-01-07 19:53:34] <%Presarius712> i like 5v5
[2023-01-07 19:53:39] <HobbitSlayer> i think they'll nerf ram's ult range eventually
[2023-01-07 19:53:39] <theguyz7> moira op
[2023-01-07 19:53:41] <comminforyou> 2 tanks lmao
[2023-01-07 19:53:44] <+backlit93> 6v6 arcade mode role que would be kinda fun tho
[2023-01-07 19:53:45] <%TheGreekSpeedster> The only problem with 5v5 is snipers
[2023-01-07 19:53:46] <%Homeycomb> As long as it never shifts to ruin the game like GOATS personally I can still enjoy playing a game where a hero is instalocked. Kind of hard not to have a meta like that with limited pool
[2023-01-07 19:53:50] <%+jsapphire6> Double shield says hello
[2023-01-07 19:53:53] <7evv> 6v6 was so hard to win
[2023-01-07 19:53:57] <sleepycatloaf> @Techative Yeah no worries but thanks again for letting me hdesHug hdesLove
[2023-01-07 19:53:58] <honomu> widow thriving in 5v5
[2023-01-07 19:53:58] <dru61988> i personally believe that not a single character should be able to 1 shot boosted or not, aka zen/ sojourn/hanzo
[2023-01-07 19:54:10] <%timtheenchantress42> I find if I mess up my cooldown timing with orisa once I'm doomed unless my team wins the team fight immediately
[2023-01-07 19:54:10] <dru61988> shouldnt*
[2023-01-07 19:54:11] <%CrazzYettii> thoughts on them adding a "heal received" stat so that people can see just how many resources are being pumped into them?
[2023-01-07 19:54:11] <+ixmiramarxx> i try to carry teams but ppl dont want ot listen
[2023-01-07 19:54:14] <%+Techative> yeah I wish they'd at least bring back a 6v6 mode in the arcade
[2023-01-07 19:54:23] <LilMomochii> snipers are the bane of my existence as a support main Sadge

[2023-01-07 20:48:05] <Pekom> Wait a min... do you normally get healed for staying next to payload?
[2023-01-07 20:48:07] <kingq21234> Where’s his team ?
[2023-01-07 20:48:09] <01000100_01001010> Junker is the best designed fps tank in the game?

[2023-01-07 20:48:16] <%+tm_901> you get 1.75x from payload as well?
[2023-01-07 20:48:17] <%faultysaeg> This should be the new leaver policy on comp, all remaining team members get slight buffs to stats until you finally just have a raid boss fighting the entire enemy team.
[2023-01-07 20:48:17] <Nexallus> @pekom yes…..
[2023-01-07 20:48:18] <Hakaisha89> wait, where is the rest of emongs team?

[2023-01-07 21:33:46] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-07 21:33:55] <!%$Vent_YeahManThatsCool> we talking about the upcoming in-game skull sprays for the tick tock drop event?
