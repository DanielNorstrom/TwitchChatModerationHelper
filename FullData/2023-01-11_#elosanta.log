[2023-01-11 07:05:33] <guppybara> euw not up
[2023-01-11 07:05:34] <06skeler_> Scurvy is a disease caused by low levels of vitamin C. It was common in the past among long-distance sailors because they didn't eat enough fruit and vegetables. Although rare today, scurvy is still seen in people who don't eat enough fruit and vegetables, as well as in infants and elderly patients.

I need to pay almost 20,000 pesos in interest, it's like 1,050 dollars and every time I collect money they take 50 dollars from me for 20 days. I don't know what to do, I earn very little to pay it off quickly, I earn 2,500 pesos a week, which is like 130 dollars, and I feel like I'm never going to finish paying for this :(
