[2023-01-06 02:30:18] <@%$Kindredmsg> NODDERS nice
[2023-01-06 02:32:26] <%$Applin_L> my new job actually has me paying more attention to work than my old job... cant listen as much to Bimp and so I missed most of it
[2023-01-06 02:33:01] <%$alex_melted_> So like this one time like I was flying an airplane which I don't know how to do but it was fully sick and I was like oh I'm going to go show kevo so I started flying really low because I want to try and give Kevin a high five and like never mind that even if the plane was landed it still wouldn't be possible due to the height of the window didn't stop me from trying, uh knocked out mum's house and crashed the plane
[2023-01-06 02:34:51] <@%$Kindredmsg> @Applin_L same. I miss a lot of morning streams these days. I'm home 3 days a week but its usually just bimp in the background yelling barbScream

[2023-01-06 02:37:48] <@%$Kindredmsg> I actually was for the good first half of the year. Getting paid to do nothing.
[2023-01-06 02:38:08] <@%$Kindredmsg> Good ole severance packages
[2023-01-06 02:38:13] <%$Applin_L> for me it was a actually a good switch, work is actually interesting, so cool bald programming (with hair) stuff
[2023-01-06 02:38:58] <%$alex_melted_> none of my jobs had anywhere in their documents that they offered severance, not that I was fired from any of them
[2023-01-06 02:38:58] <@%$Kindredmsg> nice! enjoying your job is huge. I ... tolerate my job at the moment. It pays the bills but if a new more gooder job comes around. peepoLeaveFinger

[2023-01-06 02:41:22] <@%$Kindredmsg> Yes he took tonight off
[2023-01-06 02:41:25] <@%$Kindredmsg> DS1 rando ran long this morning
[2023-01-06 02:41:53] <%+rathgus> Nice! Yeah, I was on for part of it.  Sounds good.  See y'all manana.
[2023-01-06 02:41:56] <%$alex_melted_> it was a combination of things that made me quit but yeah I've not been able to settle on anything else.
[2023-01-06 02:41:56] <%peeepoJuice> @rathgus no, he just ended stream. Said he will come back as soon as u leave.

[2023-01-06 02:42:57] <@%$Kindredmsg> @alex_melted_ NODDERS yeah job transitioning can be rough. Where I work now is where I worked before, different position, and is no joke, 4-5min drive from me.
[2023-01-06 02:42:58] <%+rathgus> @peeepoJuice Go figure.  He probably just forgot my VIP dunce hat.
[2023-01-06 02:43:10] <%$alex_melted_> i've been considering finding something, anything, while passing the time in taking some kind of programming course
[2023-01-06 02:43:38] <%higHChloride> PeepoJuice
[2023-01-06 02:43:57] <%$alex_melted_> but most things are asking an arm or a leg or don't pay enough, things are great
[2023-01-06 02:43:58] <@%$Kindredmsg> I'd be happy to have a full time remote job again. Hybrid is nice but I wouldn't mind the full time at home gig again
[2023-01-06 02:43:58] <%$Applin_L> switching career to bald programming was the best move of my life
[2023-01-06 02:44:11] <%peeepoJuice> i quit software development all together. I love programming but when money is involved it just ruins it for me.
[2023-01-06 02:44:35] <%$Applin_L> yeah, I can see that
[2023-01-06 02:44:35] <%+deluxelettuce339> is Barb taking the night off?
[2023-01-06 02:44:39] <%$alex_melted_> yes
[2023-01-06 02:44:40] <@%$Kindredmsg> Have 30 years experience. Job salary = 40k
[2023-01-06 02:44:49] <@%$Kindredmsg> yes Deluxe. DS1 rando ran long. Took night off
[2023-01-06 02:44:53] <%+deluxelettuce339> thanks guys have a good night
[2023-01-06 02:44:59] <%$alex_melted_> you too
[2023-01-06 02:45:01] <%peeepoJuice> @Kindredmsg doing what, if i can ask?
[2023-01-06 02:45:02] <@%$Kindredmsg> veiWave
[2023-01-06 02:45:31] <@%$Kindredmsg> @peeepoJuice btw that example isn't my job. I was just referring to what companies ask for
[2023-01-06 02:45:38] <%peeepoJuice> oh yeah
[2023-01-06 02:45:59] <%peeepoJuice> i love the examples where its like "X years in this language" but the language hasnt even been out for that long KEKW
[2023-01-06 02:46:00] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg I hybrid work.  At home 3-4 days per week.  In 1-2 days per week depending.  But I have to, nature of the position.  I like it.  I'm only 20-30 from work... 1hr+ on a really bad day.
[2023-01-06 02:46:22] <%$alex_melted_> that's a big problem for me I essentially don't have experience since I am so young
[2023-01-06 02:46:34] <@%$Kindredmsg> but I'm an internal channel account manager- I manage resellers of enterprise equipment (servers, storage, networking, etc)
[2023-01-06 02:46:44] <@%$Kindredmsg> specifically for HP Enterprise
[2023-01-06 02:46:51] <%$alex_melted_> i get the feeling most places don't bother looking at meh- so its demoralizing
[2023-01-06 02:47:03] <%peeepoJuice> U need to work on cool projects and show it off. Its the only to stand out, besides doing actual work with internships.
[2023-01-06 02:47:34] <%+rathgus> Ah HP.  We have a big contract of yours.
[2023-01-06 02:47:37] <@%$Kindredmsg> @peeepoJuice yeah its that cycle of "need 5 experience but nobody will hire you to get that experience" loop
[2023-01-06 02:47:47] <%$alex_melted_> nothing I have really done is all that cool, I worked in warehouses and there isn't much to show off
[2023-01-06 02:47:57] <@%$Kindredmsg> HP Enteprise- not HP Inc. I don't deal with desktops, laptops, and printer bullshit
[2023-01-06 02:48:17] <%peeepoJuice> Yeah. I got out of that loop by applying to junior positions and also having a few years of experience from my co-op in college.
[2023-01-06 02:48:23] <%+rathgus> Right.  We have that also.
[2023-01-06 02:48:39] <%peeepoJuice> But even with all that, it was hard. 70 applications per week, took about a month to find a job
[2023-01-06 02:48:43] <@%$Kindredmsg> Just making sure rathgus. I get so much regular HP shit sent my way.... no go away
[2023-01-06 02:48:56] <%$alex_melted_> i did construction in high school but I found it just wasn't for me.
[2023-01-06 02:48:57] <@%$Kindredmsg> jesus peeepoJuice
[2023-01-06 02:49:03] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg Oh, I hear ya.  Believe you me.
[2023-01-06 02:49:18] <%$alex_melted_> markets are ruthlessr
[2023-01-06 02:49:31] <%$alex_melted_> i hate it here
[2023-01-06 02:49:32] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus you an end user or a var? veiThink
[2023-01-06 02:49:34] <%$Applin_L> thats crazy peepojuice
[2023-01-06 02:49:57] <%peeepoJuice> @Kindredmsg it sounds hard, but if u do 10 per day, u come up with a system pretty quick so it was only an hour of work per day lol.
[2023-01-06 02:50:18] <%$alex_melted_> still that's a lot of apps
[2023-01-06 02:50:39] <@%$Kindredmsg> ah I suppose. My job skill set is niche so I don't even think I could apply to that many places a day. nyannLul
[2023-01-06 02:50:43] <%peeepoJuice> Yeah but thats how i was taught in college. We have a course that was just about applying for jobs and doing mock interviews.
[2023-01-06 02:50:57] <%$alex_melted_> yeah I didn't go to college
[2023-01-06 02:51:08] <%$alex_melted_> i would have wasted my time there
[2023-01-06 02:51:17] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg End user of the products and services.  I do Enterprise Cybersecurity Architecture / Engineering for the US public sector.
[2023-01-06 02:52:09] <%+rathgus> For both IT and OT environments.
[2023-01-06 02:52:11] <%peeepoJuice> @Kindredmsg i actually applied to places outside my province. I had no issues moving anywhere, was not tethered geographically.
[2023-01-06 02:52:37] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus neat NODDERS My background is pre-sales solution architect. I used to work for a VAR for a long while designing data centers and planning with end users their infrastructure.
[2023-01-06 02:53:07] <@%$Kindredmsg> @peeepoJuice that's a huge plus. Thankfully a lot of places these days offer remote, which expands where you can apply to greatly
[2023-01-06 02:53:39] <%peeepoJuice> Oh dude, i wish remote work was a thing 3 years ago haha. Didnt have that option like today.
[2023-01-06 02:53:47] <%$alex_melted_> i want a remote job
[2023-01-06 02:53:59] <%$alex_melted_> last one was a 30 minute drive
[2023-01-06 02:54:19] <%$alex_melted_> never again unless they pay really good
[2023-01-06 02:54:50] <@%$Kindredmsg> I worked remote full time for 7 years, before it was really a thing. It was great.
[2023-01-06 02:55:17] <%peeepoJuice> when i did my co-ops, it was in a different city which was like over an hour by train, one way. I basically woke up early and got home by 7-8. lol
[2023-01-06 02:55:25] <@%$Kindredmsg> like when covid hit. It was... whatever. Cool. Just going back to my daily grind. Nothing changed.
[2023-01-06 02:55:28] <%+rathgus> Ah, very nice. A lot of my days now are compliance driven, but I get to tell people how to build and integrate cyber operations and network / environment hardening... like blue/purple team stuff.
[2023-01-06 02:55:54] <%$Applin_L> my current job office is a 6 hour flight away, 3 timezone apart and in another country, I think Im good for remote work for a while KEKW
[2023-01-06 02:55:56] <%$alex_melted_> there's something very attractive about basically being able to roll out of bed and being at work
[2023-01-06 02:55:56] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus Nice NODDERS although compliance shit sucks imo.
[2023-01-06 02:56:20] <%peeepoJuice> @Applin_L 12 hour daily commute? Doable COPIUM
[2023-01-06 02:56:49] <%peeepoJuice> just live on the plane lol
[2023-01-06 02:57:08] <%$alex_melted_> living on a plane would suck
[2023-01-06 02:57:13] <@%$Kindredmsg> for me the company I worked for was out of Houston, TX. I'm in Buffalo NY. No direct flights too.
[2023-01-06 02:57:23] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg Agreed.  But I get to travel around the world for it.  So, bonus.  Hawaii in March.  West Coast in May (and maybe in 2 weeks...), Japan in Sept.
[2023-01-06 02:57:27] <@%$Kindredmsg> depends alex. I wouldn't mind. But I'm an aviation dork so I'm odd.
[2023-01-06 02:57:45] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus that sounds rough. Thanks for stepping up and doing that NODDERS
[2023-01-06 02:57:46] <%$alex_melted_> yeah you still working on getting that pilots license?
[2023-01-06 02:57:47] <%peeepoJuice> @alex_melted_ idk if u can tho, like ur body cant be that high up for that long all the time? Not sure tho
[2023-01-06 02:58:03] <%$Applin_L> well, there is a direct flight from Montreal to Seattle... but yeah, imagine living in a commercial plane like that, my god it would suck
[2023-01-06 02:58:13] <@%$Kindredmsg> Sadly, no. Covid kind of wrecked that. Plus my life is in a different situation.
[2023-01-06 02:58:22] <%$alex_melted_> understandable :/
[2023-01-06 02:58:51] <@%$Kindredmsg> Just fly business class. obviously barbClueless
[2023-01-06 02:59:07] <%$alex_melted_> if the plane was constantly grounded sure
[2023-01-06 02:59:11] <%$alex_melted_> in the air never
[2023-01-06 02:59:33] <%$alex_melted_> i've never been able to sleep in anything that moves
[2023-01-06 02:59:52] <%$Applin_L> and Im a big man, airplane places are so small... I would be curious to fly business class once... but it is so expensive
[2023-01-06 03:00:03] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg Speaking of Aviation, pre-covid I had a trip out to Moffett Field and went to the museum there.  Pretty cool stuff.  I also live nearish to the Udvar-Hazy Center, so that's fun.
[2023-01-06 03:00:21] <@%$Kindredmsg> have you tried a layflat business suite bed Alex? I bet you could there, maybe
[2023-01-06 03:01:00] <@%$Kindredmsg> @Applin_L same. I've had "first" class on a regional flight but nothing with the entire sectioned off castle for yourself. Smoge one day
[2023-01-06 03:01:20] <%$alex_melted_> idk what that is
[2023-01-06 03:01:51] <%$alex_melted_> i can sleep on any semi horizontal flat surface but if it moves I can't
[2023-01-06 03:01:54] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus that's dope. I've wanted to go there. And also visit the boeing everett factory. Still on me list of things to do Smoge
[2023-01-06 03:02:23] <%$alex_melted_> i've slept on park benches over night but I can't fall asleep on an 8 hour bus ride
[2023-01-06 03:03:00] <@%$Kindredmsg> sleeping on a bus is MonkaW
[2023-01-06 03:03:13] <%$Applin_L> listening to barb yell at stupid Ragnarok sections while chatting here is pretty accurate simulation NODDERS
[2023-01-06 03:03:32] <%$alex_melted_> it was a charter bus on a field trip with other students
[2023-01-06 03:04:00] <%$alex_melted_> i guess some of that "not being able to sleep" is not wanting them to draw a dick on my forehead
[2023-01-06 03:04:11] <%peeepoJuice> im waiting for ragnarok on PC, idk if il care by the time it comes out lol
[2023-01-06 03:04:12] <%+rathgus> @Kindredmsg If I have time when I go to Seattle next, I'll stop by and take pics for you.  Or just come with me, lol.
[2023-01-06 03:04:44] <%$Applin_L> I have heard train, in Canada at least, are quite nice for travel too. IDK if there is still train infrastructure in the US
[2023-01-06 03:04:49] <@%$Kindredmsg> @alex_melted_ fair. you don't want to wake up to a MisslePack
[2023-01-06 03:05:01] <%$alex_melted_> there is train infrastructure but its so crummy
[2023-01-06 03:05:16] <@%$Kindredmsg> @rathgus one day I'll make it out. Its just harder cause I'm east coast
[2023-01-06 03:05:16] <%$alex_melted_> its embarrassing tbh

[2023-01-06 03:07:09] <%$alex_melted_> if I ever had the money I'd actually invest in public transport, not having a car in this city sucks
[2023-01-06 03:07:11] <%$Applin_L> Seattle had a tramway, I was quite surprise to see that. It seemed nice too
[2023-01-06 03:07:37] <%$Applin_L> well, still has it, it had when I went there

[2023-01-06 15:31:34] <+beholdmycape> Doom is awesome in early game but seems to really plateau in usefulness

[2023-01-06 15:31:56] <%thejumpingmouse> The fists attack sooo quickly you get to 10 stacks really quickly
[2023-01-06 15:31:59] <%haelian> once you start having to use Approval Process, the rng swings wildly between runs
[2023-01-06 15:32:14] <+magnafides> @ZefiTV seems good on paper, but in practice is not

[2023-01-06 16:23:40] <GenericMattr> end of the level he has you falling in water and then over world swimming to next level. the details
[2023-01-06 16:23:42] <%the_mmx> Original star wars is an all times classic. Prequels were a good for those who grew up in that time. New sequels are just milking dead franchise for what its worth barbGabnon
[2023-01-06 16:23:43] <+thissubwillnotstandman> yeah star wars is just "Shoot ze nazis!"

[2023-01-06 16:23:55] <%cluckimachicken> star wars is just good vs evil
[2023-01-06 16:23:55] <%GarrettAnthony> BSG was like that

[2023-01-06 16:24:11] <Cesar_66> but isn't trek mainly a series? they do have more chances to be smart than if were just a movie like wars
[2023-01-06 16:24:11] <VexedCheese> @trizgo that's a fun summary

[2023-01-06 16:24:38] <%imisgrunbula> original star wars was very political, Andor also is. Love that

[2023-01-06 16:24:48] <+Cobrahh> the expanse is very grounded with sci fi
[2023-01-06 16:24:49] <Cesar_66> expanse is great but I did not like the series... preferred the books
[2023-01-06 16:24:49] <%xeroxfiend> Strange New Worlds was fantastic
[2023-01-06 16:24:50] <%+RolloDaViking> Sliders was fun
[2023-01-06 16:24:53] <%the_mmx> Andor was cool
[2023-01-06 16:24:54] <%DJ_Sesame> The Expanse books are where it is at
[2023-01-06 16:24:55] <%$wildparadox> science fiction > science fantasy
[2023-01-06 16:24:57] <%+Beefyfife> Is GamBIT a new hack??

[2023-01-06 16:24:59] <%fumblemumble> TNG has kind of a rough start, but it gets really good later

[2023-01-06 16:25:05] <%a_decoy> andor left me wanting more.  Not experienced that lately
[2023-01-06 16:25:05] <w1steria> yeah expanse books are better for sure but that's usually how it is
[2023-01-06 16:25:06] <%thejumpingmouse> Andor is my favorite recent scifi
[2023-01-06 16:25:07] <+Bittwizard> The expanse is amazing.  One of the best sci-fi shows ever made
[2023-01-06 16:25:07] <%AlMightyBawb> expanse is dope
[2023-01-06 16:25:07] <%the_mmx> KEKW
[2023-01-06 16:25:07] <%OffDutyBill> yeah, that's been a solid development
[2023-01-06 16:25:08] <%PotatoShrimpi> Yes the Expanse show is done for the forseeable future
[2023-01-06 16:25:09] <%+MisterBaz> The expanse ruined other sci fi for me.  And I'm going to have to read the expanse books
[2023-01-06 16:25:09] <boymeetsvoid> expanse is possibly the best sci fi of the past decades
[2023-01-06 16:25:10] <%+MoskittoTV> KEKL
[2023-01-06 16:25:11] <%$MispronounceSergePlz> @kingnurn  I won't lie it's got some little issues that I'm working to fix in a future patch, but I'm proud of it overall
[2023-01-06 16:25:11] <%RedRustRiot> Andor reminded me how good Star Wars could be
[2023-01-06 16:25:13] <%$kingofgames323> I've tried The Expanse twice and dropped out midway through S1
[2023-01-06 16:25:14] <%zelbreck> Andor was great
[2023-01-06 16:25:16] <%$OpheliaPane> the show ended and all books have been finished (there is more story in the books)
[2023-01-06 16:25:18] <%mik53afk> rogue one/Andor best star wars in a long time
[2023-01-06 16:25:18] <+dallassooner> Andor is way better than it has any business being, especially since I am one of the minority that really hated Rogue 1
[2023-01-06 16:25:19] <%oracle70> Andor is adult star wars

[2023-01-06 16:25:26] <%thejumpingmouse> The Foundation on Apple TV was also pretty good. Though it didn't follow the books as close as I'd prefer

[2023-01-06 16:25:48] <%+Beefyfife> @barbarousking the Orville kinda picked up the mantle of those debates in a Sci-fi show
[2023-01-06 16:25:49] <%khog> I think it doing poorly is more due to fatigue with the shit shoveled at us
[2023-01-06 16:25:52] <%OffDutyBill> yeah Fallen Order was good

[2023-01-06 16:37:35] <CatformTV> any believers
[2023-01-06 16:37:35] <%+shameful_poo_death> It took the Office a season or two to find its feet

[2023-01-06 16:37:42] <%+DRAX_lop> the first 5 seasons is golded
[2023-01-06 16:37:43] <%$Wickermandaddy666> I always thought the episode with the coconut penis flavored water was funny
[2023-01-06 16:37:43] <%DregBasher> dwight's travel visa to argentina being protested by the Shoah Foundation was another solid joke
[2023-01-06 16:37:44] <+breboo> @SecondShalire I should just write a bot that chooses the opposite of what I would choose. Rich instantly.
[2023-01-06 16:37:45] <%+Kiavik> what episode of what show?
[2023-01-06 16:37:47] <%+mad3f> some episodes have aged very poorly but it still gets a laugh out of me every now and then
[2023-01-06 16:37:47] <%fumblemumble> The worst thing about prison was the dementors
[2023-01-06 16:37:47] <%+Dr_Seaword> How can you NOT love Scott's Tots?

[2023-01-06 16:37:50] <@%$deejay4am> that's a very "Larry David-esque" premise KEKL
[2023-01-06 16:37:51] <%+texaspoontappa99> @Vaelstraza Dwights speech is fairly early, season 2

[2023-01-06 16:37:54] <%Perico__Jones> Heart Surgeon was funny too
[2023-01-06 16:37:56] <%$xxxKing_Skeletorxxx> Scotts Tots is one of my favorite episodes
[2023-01-06 16:38:02] <%MMage09> flute guy approves of this song
[2023-01-06 16:38:02] <TheGamerPandA> Office kind of declines quick imo it was really good from season 2 to 5/6
[2023-01-06 16:38:03] <donanni> Its a good show to have on in the background because nothing happens and it doesnt matter if you are paying attention.
[2023-01-06 16:38:04] <%$KingNurN> the first episode where michael fake fires pam, is so awkward and cringy, but hilarious

[2023-01-06 16:38:07] <adinost> scott's tots is the most painful thing

[2023-01-06 16:38:26] <%y2zipper> The office is great, but season 2 has really really savage episodes.
[2023-01-06 16:38:27] <+breboo> @SecondShalire GENIUS GENIUS GENIUS
[2023-01-06 16:38:33] <%hey_yo_dflo> Agreed
[2023-01-06 16:38:33] <%HumourlessPig> So much cringe
[2023-01-06 16:38:36] <%+CeeCee_8> I agree.
[2023-01-06 16:38:36] <%Azur85> Yeah, after Season 6 especially
[2023-01-06 16:38:37] <%emceehammerpants> I just wish the office didn‚Äôt demand I care about Pam and Jim. Because fuck those two
[2023-01-06 16:38:37] <%frozen00043> Yep
[2023-01-06 16:38:38] <%+texaspoontappa99> @iKeiFeR Yeah, I have seen it too many times, hence my twitch name ha

[2023-01-06 16:38:51] <%PixlBitNick> Once Steve Carrell left, it was pretty much unwatchable
[2023-01-06 16:38:51] <+Dr_Osiris> when HE leaves imo
[2023-01-06 16:38:53] <%Demagus3> parks and rec is better but office stans don't want to admit it
[2023-01-06 16:38:53] <%$BuryTheNight> smarmy? thats a $10 word right there
[2023-01-06 16:38:53] <%+Thrilllho> season 1 is just a bad copy of the UK version. Gets better then jumps the shark a few years later
[2023-01-06 16:38:54] <Railbird> It repeats the same jokes too much
[2023-01-06 16:38:56] <%+Rozzy15> its cringe by design, some folk arent into that
[2023-01-06 16:38:59] <%+MiloticMaster2> smart and full of itself
[2023-01-06 16:39:00] <%$kingofgames323> Office gets worse the more you watch, Parks & Rec gets better the more you watch
[2023-01-06 16:39:02] <%$JustMoreZowee> it's best when it's the cringe is aggressive
[2023-01-06 16:39:02] <+kalmenus1> i dont need to watch the it crowd. i live it
[2023-01-06 16:39:03] <kpt58> parks and rec is much better
[2023-01-06 16:39:03] <%mrcheesyshoes> Jim is the weakest point of the office
[2023-01-06 16:39:03] <%the_sailman> i feel like the same thing happened with parks and rec after season 3

[2023-01-06 16:39:14] <%+texaspoontappa99> Idris Elba episodes were probably my least fav storyline

[2023-01-06 16:39:28] <Izymandias> Seth Macfarlane is smarmy
[2023-01-06 16:39:28] <%$felipe_queens> imagine having Jim as a roommate,  horrible
[2023-01-06 16:39:28] <%+solidpeyo> so it turns into a soap opera
[2023-01-06 16:39:28] <%ashoof> PB&J!
[2023-01-06 16:39:30] <+breboo> smarmy === unctuous
[2023-01-06 16:39:30] <%herewaard> early office is great because so many characters are exaggerations of ppl that exist in all offices, eventually they made the characters too absurd
[2023-01-06 16:39:34] <%Tirist24> Why arnt jim and pam married in real life like they are in the office too? AAAAAA
[2023-01-06 16:39:35] <%$FairJeremy> what about Jan?

[2023-01-06 16:40:09] <stormbrewer55> I don‚Äôt like cringe humour so the office just doesn‚Äôt do it for me

[2023-01-06 16:40:14] <%$Maravedis> The office is best enjoyed through reddit memes. The actual show is unwatchably cringe.

[2023-01-06 16:40:15] <pund3h> best office stuff is the stuff that takes part in the office
[2023-01-06 16:40:17] <%$KingNurN> @tentwo KEKW both great
[2023-01-06 16:40:17] <$Drummerman921> anyone can have bad taste and no humor
[2023-01-06 16:40:17] <%$HOTFISTdotCOM> parks and rec had MUCH better written characters
[2023-01-06 16:40:20] <+breboo> I had a roommate that would smoke a shitton of weed and watch office on the only tv in our joint at super high volume. I can never like the show.
[2023-01-06 16:40:20] <%y2zipper> The Michael Scott paper company series of episodes is brilliant.
[2023-01-06 16:40:24] <%Perico__Jones> how did you like the office pranks???
[2023-01-06 16:40:24] <$WhatsHisToes> The UK Office is better
[2023-01-06 16:40:24] <%+the_all_knowing_1> comedies are often not known for their in-depth romances
[2023-01-06 16:40:24] <%Mr_Android> I still love the Fire Safety Drill episode, makes me laugh every time
[2023-01-06 16:40:26] <%$MaraudingMap> they only put holly and michael back together cause steve was leaving the show
[2023-01-06 16:40:27] <%$wrigley418> @Overlord3456 right. See? forgot about holly.

[2023-01-06 16:40:31] <%$SeratiDood> The thing I love about the office is being able to tell when someone is watching it for the first time or not, because of how they say which characters they like
[2023-01-06 16:40:33] <alhoporo12> The amount of ethical violations in a workplace annoys me

[2023-01-06 16:41:21] <+BigGoopy> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Office. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jim's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes,

[2023-01-06 16:47:41] <@%$DanTheVP> Like if your favorite band played everyday of the week they would never sell out, once a year though, and they can pack a stadium
[2023-01-06 16:47:42] <%+Corking118> @JeromeMorrow that's not the point. there's still a real cost to uploading (time, computer access, data, editing). not to mention the cost to your algorythm placement if you have a bunch of crap with zero views

[2023-01-06 17:16:49] <%WiLDRAGE777> answer: it isn't

[2023-01-06 17:16:52] <%+Challer1> it's really boring to watch
[2023-01-06 17:16:52] <%HappyPoop_> hm, valid point
[2023-01-06 17:16:52] <%rebelappliance> ironmon difficulty is based on being unfair not on any skill checks
[2023-01-06 17:16:53] <%Mebbeso> Ni No Kuni 1 would be fun to watch you stream
[2023-01-06 17:16:56] <%$Xel562> it's basically playing slots

[2023-01-06 17:17:04] <%thejumpingmouse> Iron-mon is a waste of time. Doing a hard pokemon rom-hack would be slightly better but probably still not good

[2023-01-06 18:00:12] <%TyrionStrongjaw> For me online just doesn't build the hype up the same. I mean when it's in person you find yourself getting hype about a game you didn't even know could be speedran

[2023-01-06 18:10:10] <%LoriNoLie> I tried revisiting the witness, got an hour in and said fuck it
[2023-01-06 18:10:12] <%+CroftBond> I loved it because when it clicks it feels amazing. Kinda like people who beat their head against Malenia. Are they fart sniffers too?

[2023-01-06 18:10:19] <%ShiraNoMai> @Acy37 Oh yeah, he's enjoyed quite a few on there, it's just easier to name those than recount those he hasn't IMO lol
[2023-01-06 18:10:19] <%WalkingSEP> talos gave off witness vibes
[2023-01-06 18:10:20] <%+leglessalex> I dunno, I reckon if you *get* the trick of the witness yourself, that's a cool feeling. I didn't, so of course I hate it.

[2023-01-06 18:10:30] <%+MagicalGnome> @BarbarousKing did you see the Baba dev released a free minigame, Baba does his taxes?
[2023-01-06 18:10:30] <%SmoothNoob13> it just seemed like puzzles youd see in a mobile game
[2023-01-06 18:10:30] <+Rampage923> Can we pick the story game of fighting games for marbles?

[2023-01-06 18:10:34] <%Qu_Marsh> there's DLC for Baba now too
[2023-01-06 18:10:36] <%PastyWhite_> the fact the creator was pissed about the Looker gives you an idea.
[2023-01-06 18:10:39] <%$snoops_kush> The5oClockShadow peepoHappy / good to see you, hope you've been well

[2023-01-06 18:10:51] <%$33ryry33> Pedestrian is better than witness
[2023-01-06 18:10:51] <%$Applin_L> well the creator of The Witness is kind of very pretentious, it might reflect in the game KEKW
[2023-01-06 18:10:51] <%Lance_J> The end puzzles in baba are so insanely difficult I'd be surprised if you could even finish it
[2023-01-06 18:10:54] <%Acy37> @ShiraNoMai true, but in fairness I think a lot of them are just plain dated, I know my pick is too KEKW
[2023-01-06 18:10:55] <%+rycross> I enjoyed Baba until the post-game because the rule combinations stopped making sense to me
[2023-01-06 18:10:55] <+acousticvis> @BarbarousKing Ever try ‚ÄúThe Looker‚Äù? It‚Äôs a free parody of ‚ÄúThe Witness‚Äù on steam.
[2023-01-06 18:10:56] <%$mhyri> I miss watching you play it in the mornings
[2023-01-06 18:10:56] <%+PinkPowerRanger19> I love the witness and my farts smell amazing... you should try them sometime.
[2023-01-06 18:10:57] <%$snoops_kush> I remember when barb was a bridge lord
[2023-01-06 18:10:57] <Skrzelik> did barb got to the real meat of Baba?
[2023-01-06 18:10:57] <+Home_Inspector> Barb secretly loved The Witness. lol
[2023-01-06 18:10:57] <%tweejyy> super liminal is cool but it's short
[2023-01-06 18:10:58] <%+BaconSquared> after watching GoW5's last video on youtube i've never been so amazed how bad the story ended
[2023-01-06 18:11:03] <%+Rozzy15> chat is especially insufferable during baba
[2023-01-06 18:11:06] <%KnusperBKN> It's always awful, when you suddenly would need a colorblind mode that doesn't exist.
[2023-01-06 18:11:09] <%+mrmorrill> Any interest in The Case of the Golden idol? It's supposed to be similar to Obra Din from what i've read.

[2023-01-06 18:12:08] <Verywiseguy7> Brok and Sindri's story deserved a better everything else.
[2023-01-06 18:12:08] <MatraTheEternal> Pretty much everything Atreus is bad in Ragnarok.
[2023-01-06 18:12:08] <%+BaconSquared> There was great moments, only because GoW 4 built those moment priors. The end>? That was a war without a war.

[2023-01-06 18:12:31] <$tehLinguist> why would the game call us out like that
[2023-01-06 18:12:33] <%+solidpeyo> most people like it, not everyone have to agree to every opinion
[2023-01-06 18:12:43] <%nautrons> I think that the big difference is that some people were referring to the scenes themselves as "story" but you were looking for a cohesive narrative
[2023-01-06 18:12:47] <%+penguinfarm> @username_needed_ we're a big happy echo chamber!
[2023-01-06 18:12:48] <%+sea_priest> the besties podcast agreed with you on the story
[2023-01-06 18:12:48] <+Raz1yel> I thought Ragnarok was fantastic, however the end section felt rushed, especially the Ragnarok chapter, there was so much they could have done with it.
[2023-01-06 18:12:50] <%ShiraNoMai> Atreus also just isn't fun to play as
[2023-01-06 18:12:50] <%eagleheardt> You want God of War? We have God of War at home
[2023-01-06 18:12:50] <%$Nanoni14> main story was bade but i liked the side one

[2023-01-06 18:12:55] <%+solidpeyo> I hated playing as the boy too
[2023-01-06 18:12:55] <+acousticvis> Whoever made this mod did a good job.  Nice atmosphere and theme.
[2023-01-06 18:12:56] <%nautrons> the scenes were good but no cohesive narrative
[2023-01-06 18:12:56] <%+MentallyInept> You aren't alone but I definitely don't agree, even if I don't think Ragnarok had the *best* story.
[2023-01-06 18:12:57] <%+BaconSquared> So many of the characters could have been removed with no impact to anything
[2023-01-06 18:13:04] <%WiLDRAGE777> we did get the longest speech in history because of it!

[2023-01-06 18:13:32] <%nautrons> scene-by-scene ragnarok had great moments, but the narrative overall was lacking, so that's why you get those differing opinions
[2023-01-06 18:13:32] <%TheMadMoxxie> barbStare
[2023-01-06 18:13:33] <%ShiraNoMai> RIGHT?
[2023-01-06 18:13:33] <%$OtziNR> I was promised bonus points! barbCmon
[2023-01-06 18:13:36] <%$Big_Weez> I feel like a lot of Ragnarok success was due to emotional appeal
[2023-01-06 18:13:37] <%higHChloride> NODDERS
[2023-01-06 18:13:37] <%Mr_Android> I think Odin was awesome, until Ragnarok started
[2023-01-06 18:13:40] <$reservoir_dawgs> The ironwood part was so terrible
[2023-01-06 18:13:41] <+Rampage923> Just started ragnorok, they immediately give you way too many clues for all puzzles
[2023-01-06 18:13:41] <MauPressagio> it was rushed. the story had to be twice as long for it to work
[2023-01-06 18:13:41] <Hehyioss> IKR
[2023-01-06 18:13:42] <%$MorridHasCoffee> I really just missed how grounded and focused GoW4 was in Ragnarok
[2023-01-06 18:13:42] <%HappyPoop_> i disrespectfully agree
[2023-01-06 18:13:42] <%$kingofgames323> Sometimes I agree with you, sometimes I don't. Either way I shut up
[2023-01-06 18:13:43] <%Zere_Zavier> I feel like you missed a lot with how you pushed forward so fast through the atreus parts because to me when I played it this story felt like atreus was the protagonist but they were afraid to leave kratos behind
[2023-01-06 18:13:43] <%88robinson> where is Red Dead 2 on your list of great games?
[2023-01-06 18:13:43] <%vacuum_packed> peepoVanish
[2023-01-06 18:13:44] <%ShiraNoMai> and the mask being a complete waste was just the icing on that
[2023-01-06 18:13:45] <%+Ph3ster> bread to assimiliate?
[2023-01-06 18:13:46] <%$The5oClockShadow> Yeah....it was a huge buildup for....not much
[2023-01-06 18:13:46] <%Miets> I think the only bad parts of Ragnarok truly were the garbage ending
[2023-01-06 18:13:52] <%shdwstar2420> I thought the story was okay the twist was fine and I agree with you on the Atreus part
[2023-01-06 18:13:52] <%Manon66> NODDERS that's my biggest disapointment with ragnarok
[2023-01-06 18:13:55] <Skrzelik> so many things ended up useless like Ironwood, the Mask, fucking THYR
[2023-01-06 18:13:57] <%OOOO_Sebby> the only aesir they did much of anything with was heimdall
[2023-01-06 18:13:58] <%$macdreinthebae> It should have been a trilogy barbGabnon
[2023-01-06 18:13:58] <%+jwowillo> Atreus would be cool if they sewed his mouth shut
[2023-01-06 18:14:02] <%+penguinfarm> his motivations don't really make sense
[2023-01-06 18:14:02] <%+shameful_poo_death> Seems MCU accurate
[2023-01-06 18:14:06] <%+Renaldo_Moon> im still confused by the collectors edition thors hammer statue hype and then thor was barely in the game? never got to use his hammer or anything
[2023-01-06 18:14:09] <%$GlaceonYo> THE MASK I GOTTA DIE FOR IT FOR NO REASON barbClueless
[2023-01-06 18:14:09] VIEWERS: 5¬†358
[2023-01-06 18:14:14] <%+DanteX640> Thor, Odin, and the optional bosses were all pretty underwhelming
[2023-01-06 18:14:16] <%KnusperBKN> Thor finally had some character development, boom dead
[2023-01-06 18:14:18] <+JeanVaIjean24601> Odin is not smart, he's knowledgable...big difference
[2023-01-06 18:14:18] <%Jamza_> It never does fucking anything
[2023-01-06 18:14:22] <%DregBasher> a macguffin with absolutely no impact to the story at the end
[2023-01-06 18:14:22] <%$ChickenLobotomy> GOW R had content for 2 games and they cramped it into one
[2023-01-06 18:14:22] <%Rosisson> the mask had a valid explanation and why odin is so obsessed imo
[2023-01-06 18:14:22] <bombquistador> Thats the problem with dumb people writing smart characters
[2023-01-06 18:14:23] <%+valetboy> Richard Schiff didn't strike me as the right voice for the role
[2023-01-06 18:14:24] <%Demagus3> mask should have just been a briefcase that glowed gold when you open it
[2023-01-06 18:14:25] <%Azur85> They explain nothing about it really. It's so vague
[2023-01-06 18:14:27] <$reservoir_dawgs> The mask had zero payoff
[2023-01-06 18:14:30] <MauPressagio> hard to care about something with 0 explanation
[2023-01-06 18:14:32] <%+Dekeese> well odin's greed and fear of ragnarok drives him into bad decisions
[2023-01-06 18:14:33] <%+BaconSquared> "Do better" was terrible to me as a show of growth. it was a cop out.
[2023-01-06 18:14:34] <%$Definitely_Alive> You could tell they wanted this to be three games and there was a point where they had to fit story beats in there intended for the third game.
[2023-01-06 18:14:34] <%BelAirJeff> Majoras mask tho
[2023-01-06 18:14:39] <%Miets> Eh, I can see why the mask is important. But the way they just destroy it a the end randomly is what I hated.
[2023-01-06 18:14:40] <%$The_JuggerNerd> Are we getting another game?  like are they gonna try and save the story and RAGNAR√ñK was just a footer ?
[2023-01-06 18:14:42] <%Kilram> Hard agree. I feel like they were meant to mimic a bad father/son relationship. A glimpse into how bad it could be between Kratos / Atreus if they didn't work together. Very on the nose.
[2023-01-06 18:14:42] <%+QuartzB_> they never explained it and then it gets destroyed anyways
[2023-01-06 18:14:42] <%+warlordray> all it needed was Jim carey and it would have been fine
[2023-01-06 18:14:43] <%+Assertonsin> barb did you like the scream movies?
[2023-01-06 18:14:45] <%SacraficialYoshi> i loved odins VA
[2023-01-06 18:14:47] <+Shaman_Lu> Thor Ragnarok is the Prequel for The Mask LUL
[2023-01-06 18:14:47] <%+shameful_poo_death> That reminds me, Jim Carrey's The Mask is an underrated movie
[2023-01-06 18:14:48] <%Lance_J> They go on and on about how smart and clever and deceptive odin is. But he basically never lies and is just straightforward and stupid all game
[2023-01-06 18:14:49] <%+joejohnriver5> i cant comprehend what kind of answers the mask would give anyway
[2023-01-06 18:14:50] <+blackop778> Barb have you ever played an SCP game?
[2023-01-06 18:14:51] <%$GlaceonYo> Used car salesman Odin was great
[2023-01-06 18:14:51] <%ShiraNoMai> there were also plot holes with that mask: why the fuck was it working in Helhiem when it was never there?
[2023-01-06 18:14:54] <%TheMadMoxxie> Loki's mask made Jim Carrie funny
[2023-01-06 18:14:56] <%+MiloticMaster2> I think Thor's development was a bit quick at the end
[2023-01-06 18:14:57] <+DandyCheeks> Is this a 2023 hack? Like if it was an award show
[2023-01-06 18:14:58] <%Mr_Android> I liked bad dad Thor, I do wish his final fight was better gameplay wise
[2023-01-06 18:14:59] <askx27> man, im enjoyin forbiden west more than i enjoyed gow

[2023-01-06 18:15:13] <%+CroftBond> Scream 4 was amazing and ahead of its time regarding streaming culture.
[2023-01-06 18:15:14] <%theasp00> to Odin: remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[2023-01-06 18:15:16] <+Rampage923> do you like scream the painting?
[2023-01-06 18:15:16] <BahamutOdin> I‚Äôm playing GOW 4 right now for the 1st time, I‚Äôve got to try Ragnarok for myself.
[2023-01-06 18:15:17] <%$Colburn0004> Scream 3 as a comedy is underrated
[2023-01-06 18:15:18] <%Screegar> I would love an Egyptian God of War. All new characters

[2023-01-06 19:12:08] <%+R1NZL3R_87> I kinda feel like they set Syndri up to be an antagonist in whatever the new GoW becomes

[2023-01-06 19:12:11] <%+jtobiaz> He was the real one
[2023-01-06 19:12:11] <rokxx> They needed Syndry to be the escape goat to their writing short shortcomings
[2023-01-06 19:12:13] <%Demagus3> even before that sindri is 100% justified with his anger at atreus but the game seems to treat him as unreasonable at that point

[2023-01-06 19:12:44] <%Rainy_Dayze_> He was the one who made stupid choices to move the plot along
[2023-01-06 19:12:45] <+Cyg2112> it was about the developers and their FaMiLy DyNaMiCs

[2023-01-06 19:12:50] <%$Hildibrah> @BelAirJeff calling them character action is a large stretch when DMC5 has better combat by miles
[2023-01-06 19:12:51] <TiniTinyTONY> Atreus makes lots of mistakes, but I think it's mostly about Kratos being okay with letting him go
[2023-01-06 19:12:51] <+Ncorbino> How they handled Odin or Thor were the biggest fuck ups imo
[2023-01-06 19:12:52] <%Demagus3> i think he was SUPPOSED to have a coming-of-age story but most of the time those involve the character learning they don't actually know everything, and that never really happened with atreus
[2023-01-06 19:12:53] <%$crizotibin> it would be cool if atreus visit Kratos culture and find who his father was
[2023-01-06 19:12:55] <%$souleater98> He was trying to find out what his destiny was or something
[2023-01-06 19:12:55] <%rgstupot> i dunno, but that draupnir spear was dope
[2023-01-06 19:13:01] <%+solidpeyo> Atreus never learned

[2023-01-06 19:19:25] <%Jaiguru14> it blows my mind that you have time to play games "off stream"

[2023-01-06 19:20:03] <%$Hildibrah> @RCA343s yeah i think that barb loves the mario rpg games
[2023-01-06 19:20:05] <stormbrewer55> Paper Mario 1 would be a cool marbles choice
[2023-01-06 19:20:10] <%9s_nine> does it have an endgame?
[2023-01-06 19:20:11] <+g00fydrag0n> builds levels under an unknown name in smm2 in his free time

[2023-01-06 19:20:17] <%+odym82> Just like irl
[2023-01-06 19:20:18] <%+GaimeGuy> you know what would b e an even cooler marbles choice? Yakuza 0
[2023-01-06 19:20:27] <mmmmsugar> I‚Äôm worried a new 2d Nintendo Mario would have a redesigned Mario that looks like it was designed for mobile game or that the characters have the rogue legacy aesthetic
[2023-01-06 19:20:27] <%$Bloody_Raw> @stormbrewer55 leave mario out of marbles

[2023-01-06 19:20:42] <%+rudefrog> late game bannerlord is just ai making random choices for the sake of it
[2023-01-06 19:20:42] <%+GaimeGuy> I haven't been using my gaming laptop for gaming over my steam deck because its speakers suck. KEKW
[2023-01-06 19:20:42] <+darthecks> Bannerlord was definitely fun to watch.
[2023-01-06 19:20:43] <%EvilTCell> Barb plays Contra off stream to get better
[2023-01-06 19:20:44] <%+Beefyfife> I saw Cliffy started Banner Lord and he went for the Kuzhaits cause he wanted to build a ‚Äúdesert Applebees‚Äù with a caravan build
[2023-01-06 19:20:49] <+Ncorbino> Soul stone survivors is amazing on steam deck if no one‚Äôs tried
[2023-01-06 19:20:49] <%AlMightyBawb> excited to see how mods evolve for BL

[2023-01-06 19:21:03] <stormbrewer55> Barb would not like FF14 at all oh god lol
[2023-01-06 19:21:03] <%CS_Hague> It needs mods to be more fun. Diplomacy mod actually makes it so you can make non-aggression pacts and alliances
[2023-01-06 19:21:04] <%BelAirJeff> Why do so many people recommend games that you won‚Äôt like
[2023-01-06 19:21:05] <%NotMacNamera> @mmmmsugar You don't like the RL for Mario? jw

[2023-01-06 19:21:28] <%Diegazbro> i would rather have a mario maker 3 that would let us do some node programming a la game builder garaage
[2023-01-06 19:21:28] <%$Colburn0004> I was honestly shocked at your liking Loop Hero
[2023-01-06 19:21:29] <%$Hildibrah> @stormbrewer55 14 is too long for someone who streams multiple games a year
[2023-01-06 19:21:37] <%$Colburn0004> I said you were nuts doing 2 hours during 24 hour

[2023-01-06 19:27:30] <%NotMacNamera> @NullNRG I had reserved mine, and when it came time to buy, I passed on it.  I could use the hardware yes (I'd use it as an emulation station) but I don't need the screen (I have a switch) so I decided to wait for the AMD chips to come to DIY market so I can build my own mini PC.  So that's my story anyways.  What's yours?

[2023-01-06 19:43:49] <%CarbonAxiom> @KOOLSM0KE I'm a long time Metroid fan, and I think it has by far the best gameplay in the series (for 2D games anyway). There is a mechanic that looks like a quick time event, but it's actually a cutscene that plays if you land a parry. It leads to some fun stuff in boss fights imo

[2023-01-06 19:45:58] <%TheGeohound> For necro what's the play? Skeletin qty / lvl / or summon quality?
[2023-01-06 19:45:59] <Rambo_3rd> @KOOLSM0KE Honestly true
[2023-01-06 19:45:59] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> Only have to worry about two stats and summons do all the work, perfection
[2023-01-06 19:46:01] <+we_are_turok> If the creator tells you theres shell jumps. its hard. if they dont, its relativiely easy but still precise @notmacnamera but theres easy hacks anyways so..
[2023-01-06 19:46:01] <@%$deejay4am> @KOOLSM0KE Dread is a sick game, up there in quality IMHO with Super and Fusion. QTE are *kinda* a thing but it's more of a parry-combo deal, and only really affects boss fights like CarbonAxiom said. Would recommend barbOK
[2023-01-06 19:46:02] <%$Airik2112> @MispronounceSergePlz So, things randomly despawn/ don't spawn in this.. do you have any idea why? I know nothing of Lunar Magic or how to even detect something like that.
