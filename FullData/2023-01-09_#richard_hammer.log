[2023-01-09 05:19:57] <%+pargrok> it was a maiden voyage and shitty time of year
[2023-01-09 05:20:03] <%$Rararawr> source: i put a mine in front of the ship
[2023-01-09 05:20:06] <$Negarretep> It was certainly the CIA

[2023-01-09 05:20:27] <@%BranLan> I prefer the idea that the captain just said "check this shit out" and just plowed into the iceberg.
[2023-01-09 05:20:31] <%Fanrogh> they did call it an unsinkable ship but it wasn't done on purpose,  the reason for so many deaths on it was cause they didn't have adequate amount of lifeboats since they truly believed it could not sink
[2023-01-09 05:20:53] <%malrockk> The CIA was sinking ships before the CIA even existed
[2023-01-09 05:21:01] <%$Rararawr> It may have cratered the cruise industry, but guess whose company ended with more marketshare
[2023-01-09 05:21:24] <%+K9kroz> lifeboat makes?
[2023-01-09 05:21:29] <%Fanrogh> thats just because it wasn't called the CIA yet
[2023-01-09 05:21:32] <%+pargrok> @malrockk who really knows when cia became the cia

[2023-01-09 05:22:25] <$Negarretep> It's a good story at least, but I doubt there's any evidence to support it
[2023-01-09 05:23:01] <%$Rararawr> need someone one smart to find that out when the cia was started. a lot of people. A sort of centralized agency great at gathering intelligence. like the FBI!
[2023-01-09 05:23:09] <%Fanrogh> its kinda the same with the Russians atm and their 5th gen fighters that are supposedly not able to be shot down , i know that one at least has tho
[2023-01-09 05:23:16] <%$Firescout> @fanrogh that's not true, they had more lifeboats than were required at the time and the ship was at 2/3rd capacity. No it wasn't enough for every single passenger to get on simultaneously, but lifeboats weren't meant to do that. They were meant to ferry people from the sinking ship to another and then return
[2023-01-09 05:23:26] <@%BranLan> It was convenient that they were able to salvage the film from the crash
[2023-01-09 05:23:27] <%+pargrok> a billionaire captianing his own ship to prove its worth and ran it in as a test I can see that

[2023-01-09 06:57:10] <%Fanrogh> what do you want a 2 inch cube for btw ?
[2023-01-09 06:57:18] <!%RevBanger> to ponder
[2023-01-09 06:57:19] <Ghost200x> tungsten melts like at like 6k Fahrenheit
[2023-01-09 06:57:48] <%+MrZev> 2in cube as in 8 cubic inches right
[2023-01-09 06:57:54] <!%RevBanger> yea
[2023-01-09 06:58:00] <%Kardmager> If I was going to get a cube of any element it would be platinum because resale
[2023-01-09 06:58:00] <%malrockk> According to google 5 lbs of tungsten should only cost $16
[2023-01-09 06:58:05] <%BGa9> and you have to melt it under argon i think or it oxidizes baddly, but i might just be thinking of titanium
[2023-01-09 06:58:16] VIEWERS: 409
[2023-01-09 06:58:40] <%BGa9> 500$ for the 2inche cube does seem off
[2023-01-09 06:58:41] <%$Rararawr> back of the keyboard its like 20g/cm3, 125cm3, 2500g, 5.5lbs?
[2023-01-09 06:59:01] <%$BlaydeX15> It's pretty though
[2023-01-09 06:59:03] <%Fanrogh> 3 422 °C thats the melting point in C dunno about you but thats a pretty expensive forge or what ever they use to melt it
[2023-01-09 06:59:05] <+pupupuputter> @bga9 I think your rightsince argon is used when tig welding with it
[2023-01-09 06:59:18] <!%RevBanger> I dont have time to fish, all I do is work and watch Dick stream
[2023-01-09 07:00:01] <%malrockk> Sounds like cost to make it into a nice cube is expensive
[2023-01-09 07:00:07] <%sychro_98> Maybe it’s the required craftsmanship
[2023-01-09 07:00:07] <!%RevBanger> I do have argon but nothing that can melt tungsten atm

[2023-01-09 07:01:18] <%BGa9> the 1inche cubes cost like 80
[2023-01-09 07:01:35] <%$BlaydeX15> Yeah, same reason glass prices don't scale linearly, hard to make it larger i guess?

[2023-01-09 07:02:22] <%Fanrogh> ,5 an inch squared is is a significant amount more tungsten so im guessing thats why the big pricejump from 1,5 to 2 inch
[2023-01-09 07:02:26] <%BGa9> if i buy you the 4inch cube would you resell my present
[2023-01-09 07:02:28] <%$Rararawr> Zealousee missed a 2 in there

[2023-01-09 07:02:55] <!%RevBanger> @Fanrogh Yea
[2023-01-09 07:03:02] <%Fanrogh> @Zealousee you are forgetting about the equipend to melt tungsten tho
[2023-01-09 07:03:10] <Zealousee> just rubberbands bud
[2023-01-09 07:03:20] <Ghost200x> So like... You have to keep it at super high temps or else it just instantly starts to solidifyl. I would assume, so you have to put it in the mold while its melting or it won't be a smooth cube
[2023-01-09 07:03:31] <%BGa9> you wouldnt resell my 4" tungsten cube gift valued at $3500 on amazon would you?
[2023-01-09 07:03:34] <%+StarkSilence> a 2 inch cube is 8 1 inch cubes, not 4
[2023-01-09 07:03:50] <%$BlaydeX15> @Zealousee Ah, but you see... this is a cube, so you don't square it, you cube it.

[2023-01-09 07:16:40] <%+MrZev> zealousee try SMG start.  get weapons early then always keep at least 70 money before starting for several waves,
[2023-01-09 07:16:42] <%$Rararawr> the cheapest price on osmium cubes is $14,000, for 1 inch
[2023-01-09 07:16:49] <%+Yiu113> You need machinery which can actually *melt* tungsten without melting itself
[2023-01-09 07:16:49] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2023-01-09 07:16:50] <%+MrZev> for streamer that is
[2023-01-09 07:16:55] <+GrizzledWizzard> Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, so it’s hard to process
[2023-01-09 07:17:08] <%Fanrogh> 6192°F is the melting point and you need high temps to keep it molten while you pour it
[2023-01-09 07:17:12] <%malrockk> Also, don't think they are mass producing 2" cubes
[2023-01-09 07:17:18] <%+MrZev> fish on.. I think
[2023-01-09 07:17:28] <!%RevBanger> A tungsten fishing lure is probably not a high purity
[2023-01-09 07:17:36] <%Kardmager> Would it be easier just to compress it into the fit?
[2023-01-09 07:17:37] <%+K9kroz> fish?
[2023-01-09 07:17:40] <%+DaneMcRae> argon
[2023-01-09 07:17:48] <!%RevBanger> the cube is a high purity
[2023-01-09 07:17:55] <%Saighdear173> Tolerances are a bitch. What's the acceptable tolerance for you? 1/32" of an inch on each side? More or less?
[2023-01-09 07:18:00] <%Fanrogh> yeah purity is also a factor
[2023-01-09 07:18:03] <!%RevBanger> of tungsten
[2023-01-09 07:18:05] <%+Yiu113> For the guy who has the stuff that can do it? Probably a lot less than other people. For everyone else? Actually getting that stuff.

[2023-01-09 07:18:22] <+Ralekin> dick we know how to get to the moon, still fucking expensive to do it again
[2023-01-09 07:18:22] <%+K9kroz> slag removal, waste cost, manpower, .. all cheaper overseas

[2023-01-09 07:18:35] <%+Yiu113> So the guy who's making them can charge more because other people can't make them without a high investment point
[2023-01-09 07:18:41] <%Fanrogh> if you buy a ring of gold thats 14 karat vs the same ring in 24 the cost is much higher for the 24 then the 14 one
[2023-01-09 07:18:45] <+Ralekin> 6k temps expensive to manage
[2023-01-09 07:19:05] <%Fanrogh> those are probably low purity like rev said Dick
[2023-01-09 07:19:17] <+Ralekin> a tiny piece of metal is easier to reach that temp than 1000x times that mass
[2023-01-09 07:19:17] <+buzzin420> An alloy named Tungsten carbide converts into tungsten (VI) oxide (WO3) that mixes with an equal amount of powdered tungsten and carbon through a heating process. It creates powder as a result, and it is easy to press and mold it into different shapes like cubes, rings, and bucking bars.
[2023-01-09 07:19:51] <%+Yiu113> It's a stupid niche thing that they're gouging on yeah
[2023-01-09 07:19:54] <+grymgrum> Really sounds like tungsten has had a very good marketing campaign
[2023-01-09 07:19:58] <horseglassfeeder> How big is the cube we are talking about and what is the price?
[2023-01-09 07:20:01] <+GrizzledWizzard> Well that’s certainly true
[2023-01-09 07:20:05] <!%RevBanger> I mean idk its a cube I dont think too much about it
[2023-01-09 07:20:08] <+Ralekin> im fucking with you dick, i know its a stupid argument. my bad.
[2023-01-09 07:20:13] <Zealousee> is it a cryptobro shit
[2023-01-09 07:20:19] <%malrockk> And high cost to enter market to compete with them
[2023-01-09 07:20:21] <Zealousee> I'm done thinking about tungsten cubes
[2023-01-09 07:20:23] <hurix> who would need that 2" cube for anything? like why would you buy that?
[2023-01-09 07:20:26] VIEWERS: 426
[2023-01-09 07:20:27] <CletusC> Tolerances probably the biggest. If you are off 1/32" on a 2" cube, you are getting bitched at. If the fish weight is off 1/32", eh.. it's for fishing.
[2023-01-09 07:20:43] <%Fanrogh> yeah im not saying i personally think its worth the price but there are supply and demand and im sure that even amazon dosent have a massive supply because there is probably not that high of a demnad for them
[2023-01-09 07:20:52] <%$BlaydeX15> That $3/lb figure you found earlier was scrap value, btw. it's $50k/ton, so $25/lb. The markup isn't that insane at those costs
[2023-01-09 07:20:54] <%+K9kroz> When he talks about tolerances that could jack the price if you have a machined tungsten cube to .0001 accuracy
[2023-01-09 07:21:41] <%Kardmager> Tungsten dildos
[2023-01-09 07:21:54] <+buzzin420> Crypto bros seem to like them
[2023-01-09 07:22:00] <%+K9kroz> i think so
[2023-01-09 07:22:10] <%+K9kroz> machining it is actually rough
[2023-01-09 07:22:12] <%+Yiu113> It's a niche thing that like one person makes and a lot of people are buying for who knows reasons
[2023-01-09 07:22:20] <+Ralekin> legitimately, huge demand for fishing stuff so theres competition in manufacturing, but not many people making dumb cubes?
[2023-01-09 07:22:24] <icysystem> it's part of it for sure.
[2023-01-09 07:22:24] <!%RevBanger> It probably is, I wont lie, its a waste of money

[2023-01-09 07:22:45] <%+trevorsgame1> Or close to pure
[2023-01-09 07:22:48] <%+K9kroz> but honestly, having run a CNC router it isnt that hard to machine one to 1000th of an inch
[2023-01-09 07:22:50] <%AC_ThirtySix> "so we heard you like tungsten cubes"
[2023-01-09 07:22:54] <%Fanrogh> @K9kroz yeah i didnt think about trhe tolerances of machined things
[2023-01-09 07:23:07] <%Maki_Rollz> why are we talking about cubes?
[2023-01-09 07:23:11] <%+trevorsgame1> Just like gold cube would probably more then it’s typical weight cost
[2023-01-09 07:23:13] <%+K9kroz> would take a while tho
[2023-01-09 07:23:14] <%Saighdear173> Nothing is perfect, but tolerances are most likely like 128th of an inch and that is pricey. You could get it a lot cheaper if it was cubish.

[2023-01-09 07:32:52] <!%RevBanger> It's not rare and not worth it, its a stupid cube but the voice in my head wants it but my wallet says no so idk
[2023-01-09 07:33:36] <+GIGGA_SUBSCRIBER> wait until you learn about tungsten spheres!
[2023-01-09 07:33:45] <horseglassfeeder> It's Richard, not Poorard after all.
[2023-01-09 07:33:45] <%Kardmager> The voice in my penis says to buy a lot things for it
[2023-01-09 07:33:46] <%Fanrogh> @AC_ThirtySix in some ways carbon and hydrogen is "endless" because shit gets broken down to carbon eventually and hydrogen is a part of water so unless all the water on the plannet disapears its highly plentiful , my point was just that some things like helium that we can't make like we can carbon and hydrogen is rare and we waste it on dumb shit liek making our voice funny for a few sec and having ballons that float :P
[2023-01-09 07:34:06] <!%RevBanger> It doesn't make sense thats why I want it
[2023-01-09 07:34:11] <%Kardmager> But fuck eggs are expensive
[2023-01-09 07:34:13] <+Ralekin> which seems kind of insane. if the cost is machining, wouldnt the sphere be so much harder?
[2023-01-09 07:34:21] <bubble_d> Is there a meta progression in brotato or is it solely run based?
[2023-01-09 07:34:26] VIEWERS: 421
[2023-01-09 07:34:36] <Ghost200x> Like, tungsten is used for things that need to hold its shape in high temps or need to be heavy. Like lights, drill bits and as you said fishing hook. But, in terms of cost? Its cheap for how much actual price of product could be made. If its just a paper weight though its a rip off.
[2023-01-09 07:34:51] <%+bortz29> Have you considered an inanimate carbon rod
[2023-01-09 07:34:52] <%$BlaydeX15> @bubble_d item and character unlocks for wins
[2023-01-09 07:34:54] <%malrockk> Wonder when crypto bros will start selling their cubes because they are broke
[2023-01-09 07:35:26] <!%RevBanger> you got a point there
[2023-01-09 07:35:30] <%Kardmager> What do you think they used it for?
[2023-01-09 07:35:31] <bubble_d> @BlaydeX15 thanks!

[2023-01-09 07:35:36] <%$Rararawr> I only want used cubes
[2023-01-09 07:36:02] <horseglassfeeder> Can a useless item be in "used" condition?

[2023-01-09 07:37:27] <@%Shiverwarp> What if all your cheap fishing stuff is cheap because they use the leftovers from all these cubes
[2023-01-09 07:37:27] <!%RevBanger> lead is bad if you dont know how to handle it
[2023-01-09 07:37:49] <%Kardmager> Imagine how pissed the mailman would be having to handle the small box filled with a cube
[2023-01-09 07:37:49] <%$unknownohyeah> that explains so much

[2023-01-09 07:39:13] <Leafy_Greens905> Wait, sinkers aren’t lead anymore? I need to change out my whole tackle box lmao. I bite my sinkers all the time
[2023-01-09 07:39:45] <+buzzin420> Tungsten ore is not currently mined in the United States due to financial and environmental considerations although the U. S. has substantial deposits.
[2023-01-09 07:39:52] <%$Rararawr> Fanrogh same price midwest tungsten sells their blemished cubes
[2023-01-09 07:40:05] <thorggrim83> Vandelar import/export imports Tungsten
[2023-01-09 07:40:21] <%malrockk> US doesn't mine a lot of things because the process is messy.  We export the polution to poor countries

[2023-01-09 07:41:17] <%BGa9> that cube was 2k 2years ago
[2023-01-09 07:41:27] <+buzzin420> You could always return it and jump up

[2023-01-09 07:41:37] <@%Shiverwarp> Are there perhaps other cheaper metal cubes available
[2023-01-09 07:41:38] <%KiddProQuo> You'll be really disappointed when you view the scrap price of the tungsten.
[2023-01-09 07:42:02] <%malrockk> 2" cube is over twice the size of 1.5"
[2023-01-09 07:42:04] <%$BlaydeX15> Lead cube, and have someone write "tungsten" on it
[2023-01-09 07:42:10] <%BGa9> they have a 4:7 ratio
[2023-01-09 07:42:11] <%Fanrogh> get a leadcube and cober it in epoxy
[2023-01-09 07:42:13] <%Saighdear173> Would that polish be enough?

[2023-01-09 07:42:37] <%KiddProQuo> This sounds like a pump and dump, but with Tungsten.
[2023-01-09 07:43:04] <bubble_d> @RevBanger if youre going to get anything look into the Wire EDM cubes
[2023-01-09 07:43:07] <%Fanrogh> @Rararawr thats teh metal that they mine in africa that is in all cellphones isnt it ?
[2023-01-09 07:43:10] <!%RevBanger> Ive been convenced, thank you Dick and Chat
[2023-01-09 07:43:27] <%$Rararawr> I imagine the scrap price of tungsten is low because you now have to find a way to recycle it
[2023-01-09 07:43:32] <@%Shiverwarp> Where's my tungsten fidget spinner
[2023-01-09 07:43:34] <bubble_d> theyre the zero clearance cuts, I have a link if you want
[2023-01-09 07:43:45] <bubble_d> flush surface puzzle pieces and all
[2023-01-09 07:43:48] <Meistar__> well buying a 2" cube for 500 is also way better cube for your money compared to the 1.5" cube for 260. you get 33% more cube per Dollar
[2023-01-09 07:43:49] <%Kardmager> You can get a 1cm3 cube of platinum for $1,800
[2023-01-09 07:43:53] <!%RevBanger> I wouldent get it for a trend I just think a cube is cool
[2023-01-09 07:43:57] <%malrockk> Just wait for the next crypto crash
[2023-01-09 07:44:12] <%KiddProQuo> 2" cube is worth like $70 ish bucks at 2018 rates.

[2023-01-09 07:45:16] <%$BlaydeX15> I think Tungsten has enough of an extablished market that internet memes won't disrupt it. Lol
[2023-01-09 07:45:17] <%Fanrogh> @RevBanger talk to logan paul and get him really into tungsten cubes im sure that would help :P
[2023-01-09 07:45:19] <%KiddProQuo> It means that the sellers have like 75% overhead on the raw material. Give or take.
[2023-01-09 07:45:33] <%KiddProQuo> On the 2"
[2023-01-09 07:45:53] <!%RevBanger> I mean ill be honest I did get the idea from youtube so im chat had this discussion
[2023-01-09 07:45:58] <%KiddProQuo> Yeah, it's the market that wants the cube.
[2023-01-09 07:46:02] <!%RevBanger> glad
[2023-01-09 07:46:17] <Ghost200x> Yea the cube is largely worthless unless its being used for something
[2023-01-09 07:46:23] <%$BlaydeX15> Nah, but if cubes get popular, there's plenty of room to undercut between wholesale and retail
[2023-01-09 07:46:25] <Meistar__> i wonder if i can get ppl to sponsor my 2" cube and just sell the space on the sides as Ad space to lower the costs

[2023-01-09 07:47:48] <%$BlaydeX15> I dont think it'd effect wholesale prices, they already jump 10-20% YOY, you'd just see cubes coming closer to wholesale rate

[2023-01-09 08:49:06] <nobody1111> if you could target the far away enemy then sure, but it always targets the closest making suer that the slowing effect of the tazer is always as inefficent as possible
[2023-01-09 08:50:02] <nobody1111> or maybe I don't understand the weapon
[2023-01-09 08:50:05] <%+Yiu113> Well, slowing the first enemy in a pile slows down everyone behind him, so you're kinda wrong there.
[2023-01-09 08:50:33] <%+Yiu113> It slows in an area but enemies also have collision so they shove up againste each othermoe.

[2023-01-09 10:30:05] <%Lakart> @benispettigrew1 Because they're at war with the ocean, didn't you know?

[2023-01-09 10:30:27] <!%Calastigro> why you bringing a shotgun to go fishing, tho
[2023-01-09 10:30:27] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> shotgun would be the worst gun for fishing lol
[2023-01-09 10:30:33] <!%Calastigro> i guess, in case of carp, lol
[2023-01-09 10:30:39] <%tyrolia_valerian> @Calastigro for the carp, obviously
[2023-01-09 10:30:49] <%Lakart> @Calastigro in case of mammals?

[2023-01-09 10:31:20] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> they are also invasive in Europe, but we adapted to them
[2023-01-09 10:31:37] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> they are only native to asia

[2023-01-09 10:33:37] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> yes invasive

[2023-01-09 10:33:53] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> no, invasive does not mean kill them, that's conflating two different ideas
[2023-01-09 10:34:01] <Frosty_Virago> Invasive kinda implies it's causing issues. A lot of carp in the US are naturalized, so they're not from here yeah, but don't have a negative impact on the environment.
[2023-01-09 10:34:17] <Frosty_Virago> sorry on the ecosystem my bad

[2023-01-09 10:36:35] <!%Calastigro> i mean, there's a movement afoot to stop aquariums from keeping octopuses, because they're so smart

[2023-01-09 10:38:16] <fizzishin_slavaukraini> @benispettigrew1 depends on the species, a lot of them eat crustaceans, smaller fish
[2023-01-09 10:38:20] <%+Usinji> nice
[2023-01-09 10:38:44] <%tyrolia_valerian> they eat shellfish, certainly
[2023-01-09 10:38:45] <%Lakart> They have beaks, and there ain't no nuts and fruits under the sea so those beaks are for flesh
[2023-01-09 10:38:46] <!%Calastigro> maybe they're on the crab pots trying to eat them crabs
[2023-01-09 10:38:54] <%Lakart> @Calastigro that's exactly why lol
[2023-01-09 10:38:55] <!%Calastigro> tho crab pots are baited with fish too
[2023-01-09 10:39:01] <%thexLed> there's like a shrimp looking bait with a bunch off hooks going in like circles, soo when it grabs onto it, you can hook it in the tentacles @benispettigrew1

[2023-01-09 10:39:58] <benispettigrew1> An octopus is not a fish though right, it's a crustacean without a shell right? Like a what a slug is to a snail, an octopus is to a lobster?

[2023-01-09 10:44:31] <Frosty_Virago> Most animals don't really see the same as us either
[2023-01-09 10:44:35] <!%Calastigro> i think with primates, they put a dot of paint on their forehead, and if the animal reaches up to touch it when they see it in the mirror, they've recognized themself
[2023-01-09 10:44:52] <Frosty_Virago> who knows what a mirror looks like to them.

[2023-01-09 10:50:14] <benispettigrew1> I think if we taught orcas how to be civilized they would be able to learn it, it's like a bunch of uncivilized humans also do psycho things 10,000 years ago, but they were taught how to civilized themselves
[2023-01-09 10:50:20] <+ChromeViper> but apart from that ONE example, the reason we think orcas are crazy is because weve observed most of their behavior in captivity

[2023-01-09 10:56:15] <%thexLed> Soon we might have domesticated foxes, like we have cats and dogs, "only" reason why we really don't have is because foxes have a pretty bad smell on their fur, but apparently some people have been breeding them enough that the smell is almost completely gone, and once the smell disappears, foxes might become a more common pet

[2023-01-09 12:21:56] <%tyrolia_valerian> same thing with painkillers. we went from under to over to under-prescribing again in the span of like 20 years.
[2023-01-09 12:22:09] <+ChromeViper> its like punishing someone with short legs for not running fast enough @aweful_john

[2023-01-09 12:27:10] <aweful_john> i needed the yelling to function in some instances.
[2023-01-09 12:27:24] <aweful_john> @Lowallyn the issue with changing the words is eventually the new words become the derisive ones

[2023-01-09 12:28:11] <%Maki_Rollz> Absolute shitshow.
[2023-01-09 12:28:17] <%KiddProQuo> I wonder if they suppose it allows them to allocate resources more effectively. Especially if it's more expensive to run the separate classes.
[2023-01-09 12:28:23] <%tyrolia_valerian> okay so people stopped saying 'retarded'. now they say 'special'. or 'autistic' and they mean the same goddamn level of derision.
[2023-01-09 12:29:16] <aweful_john> rooSuffer i'll change my vocabulary too, the treadmill is infinite. i'd compare it to a bell-graph where the assholes and the bottom and the savants both have the same answer for completely different reasons

[2023-01-09 12:32:12] <%tyrolia_valerian> @Talath_ the new words become slurs. That's kid of the whole reason the treadmill is an issue. You're right that we can't really stop running on it. There's just not really a destination.
[2023-01-09 12:33:13] <%tyrolia_valerian> It's the tradeoff we pay for people not going around calling all black people the n-word
[2023-01-09 12:33:19] <$Lowallyn> master in canada isn't particularly offensive, we just don't have that slave history and the root word is french for us like in maitre
[2023-01-09 12:33:24] <$Lowallyn> which is closer to a teacher

[2023-01-09 12:34:10] <%KiddProQuo> I think stuff like the master/chief thing is done academically or even symbolically sometimes rather than out of a desire to correct an actual wrong. Ultimately, though, I don't think people lose anything because they can't be called a Chief anymore.
[2023-01-09 12:34:44] <%Maki_Rollz> I mean our values in our humor has definitely changed for the better, you don’t have to go back very far to see the change
