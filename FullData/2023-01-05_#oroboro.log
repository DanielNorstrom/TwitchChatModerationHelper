[2023-01-05 01:28:51] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> 3 is good too but 2 is amazing when conbined with Zeus or Dio

[2023-01-05 01:29:03] <LoonyNo7> it's true yeah

[2023-01-05 01:30:30] <Shadey92> I take athenas dash and then everything else doesnt matter. I find it too strong
[2023-01-05 01:31:06] <SabreClass> have you got all the hidden aspects?

[2023-01-05 01:32:47] <LoonyNo7> tip with gun is remap the controls so reload is left trigger - It makes it so you don't need to take your hand off dash/shoot to reload
[2023-01-05 01:32:57] <+Mota_J> nice

[2023-01-05 01:58:57] <sineporf> i think mirage shot is best simply because you can sell it and buy the high price item in the maze

[2023-01-05 01:59:07] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> @Oroboro the shackle actually only works if you have nothing equipped in ANY of the attack, cast and special slots.

[2023-01-05 02:00:57] <dumbodumberson> wiki is right
[2023-01-05 02:01:07] <%nola_epeeist> @LoonyNo7 ha! jinx
[2023-01-05 02:01:08] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> Oro if you will allow me I can link you to the wiki that says it works like I say.
[2023-01-05 02:01:10] <dumbodumberson> he absolutely does
[2023-01-05 02:01:23] <SabreClass> lol
[2023-01-05 02:01:28] <!%Ebonslayer> Your attack is getting the benefit. Cast and special aren't.
[2023-01-05 02:01:31] <SabreClass> just take the L man
[2023-01-05 02:01:31] <dumbodumberson> @Flipnip_Slipgrip the wiki disagrees with you, check notes
[2023-01-05 02:01:34] <dumbodumberson> you're literally misreading
[2023-01-05 02:01:37] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Its an easy test anyway
[2023-01-05 02:01:42] <+TheAssumingMage> "In order for the Shackle's bonuses to work, no Boons must be equipped in the Attack, Special or Cast slots." They use the keyword OR here
[2023-01-05 02:01:45] <dumbodumberson> the wiki IS correct, he's misreading it
[2023-01-05 02:01:48] <gribar> but its fextralife
[2023-01-05 02:01:50] <dumbodumberson> the wiki agrees with oro
[2023-01-05 02:01:51] <+TheAssumingMage> not AND

[2023-01-05 02:02:10] <%nola_epeeist> He's misreading wiki. Wiki agrees with Oro and was created from looking at the actual code.

[2023-01-05 02:02:23] <%Illuna_Meira> Scary
[2023-01-05 02:02:27] <dumbodumberson> @TheAssumingMage so for example, if you're forced to take a Cast boon, it does not affect Attack and Special).
[2023-01-05 02:02:29] <LoonyNo7> the wiki is just really badly written

[2023-01-05 02:03:29] <!%Ebonslayer> The special isn't getting the boost, neither is the cast. The attack is though.
[2023-01-05 02:03:40] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Dont forget cast on them for the free dmg

[2023-01-05 02:03:53] <dumbodumberson> shackle boosts your blank boon slots for that specific boon slot, if you have a spell boon you still get the boost for light/heavy attacks and that is final //hades speedrunner

[2023-01-05 02:05:39] <BitsySweet> could take the spear point and gamble on a boon
[2023-01-05 02:05:41] <SabreClass> demeter
[2023-01-05 02:05:44] <%Eragel> I think you can dash before the final hit of the chain and then do the final hit but I might be remembering wrong, haven't played in a while
[2023-01-05 02:05:50] <LoonyNo7> Sell the duo?
[2023-01-05 02:05:51] <%nola_epeeist> Chaos dash bonus is 100%
[2023-01-05 02:05:57] <dumbodumberson> @Oroboro highest base % increase is aphrodite
[2023-01-05 02:05:59] <+TheAssumingMage> honestly sell 2
[2023-01-05 02:06:06] <%nola_epeeist> Heart rend is 150% for crit

[2023-01-05 02:06:20] <+TheAssumingMage> I think Demeter too
[2023-01-05 02:06:20] <%nola_epeeist> Hyper sprint + rush delivery is 100% multiplicative

[2023-01-05 02:06:43] <powerless_imp0> I wouldn’t
[2023-01-05 02:06:47] <Sens_00> each small room counts
[2023-01-05 02:06:47] <%Illuna_Meira> no only last chambers count
[2023-01-05 02:06:49] <+Mota_J> chambers will be ez
[2023-01-05 02:06:52] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> If you take Aphro's keepsake now you can guarantee getting her
[2023-01-05 02:07:00] <+TheAssumingMage> I'd say keep
[2023-01-05 02:07:06] <dumbodumberson> if you don't have the last relic I'd go hourglass for the last stage, just because you get to buy the OP consumables from shop and keep them whole stage
[2023-01-05 02:07:06] <%nola_epeeist> I'd just do another run to max it out. Those end rooms are very dangerous.
[2023-01-05 02:07:08] <SabreClass> nah (based on hermes trinket) it's the whole series of chambers
[2023-01-05 02:07:10] <!%Ebonslayer> @Flipnip_Slipgrip Then he might as well keep the shackle.
[2023-01-05 02:07:18] <dumbodumberson> that's how we used to do it in early access speedruns
[2023-01-05 02:07:23] <+TheAssumingMage> pvpS
[2023-01-05 02:07:25] <BitsySweet> not bad
[2023-01-05 02:07:37] <BitsySweet> get a pom on it and it's better
[2023-01-05 02:07:48] <+camohflage> bigger crit numbers HandsUp
[2023-01-05 02:07:53] <%nola_epeeist> @SabreClass The styx chambers aren't consistent. Don't count for mom pom but count for Hermes and Than. Etc.
[2023-01-05 02:08:16] <%$MrPwner911> what kind of sword aspect you got?
[2023-01-05 02:08:18] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> Now you get Razor Shoals for extra dmg on your attack too. Awesome combo.
[2023-01-05 02:08:20] <%Evil_on_Paper> Try a boonless Kappa
[2023-01-05 02:08:24] <dumbodumberson> I'd always go skull room as your 2nd choice in this stage, the stage is always 2-5 rooms long and if you get a 2 room level you skip a boss if you take skull room second

[2023-01-05 02:08:50] <SabreClass> I think shackle would be fun on the hidden spear aspect too, that has huge base damage too
[2023-01-05 02:09:16] <%nola_epeeist> Shackle is good at higher heat where you can't consistently get the boons you need.
[2023-01-05 02:09:27] <BitsySweet> should probably try to have special aura uptime especially during bosses
[2023-01-05 02:09:37] <%nola_epeeist> But even maxed, the bonus from the crits from arty usually do more damage.
[2023-01-05 02:09:45] <!%Ebonslayer> 2

[2023-01-05 02:11:23] <dumbodumberson> @Oroboro you can dash between RB-2 and R-B3 to extend the range of the high damage combo finisher

[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <+Mota_J> its probably like 80% of the install size tbh, voice lines
[2023-01-05 02:18:32] <%SteveSketches> the script is, ostensibly, 300,000 words.

[2023-01-05 02:18:52] <sleepingbag11> Why stop at half when they can go beyond @Garrett_023 we would want to for them go beyond hades 1
[2023-01-05 02:18:58] <dumbodumberson> @zehdre I'm so stoked

[2023-01-05 02:19:43] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> Hades is a real tsundere
[2023-01-05 02:19:43] <%nola_epeeist> @sleepingbag11 sequels are really hard to make but I'm hopeful that they'll pull it off.
[2023-01-05 02:19:44] <+Garrett_023> Didn’t the vast majority of the voice acting come from the developers?
[2023-01-05 02:19:48] <+SevaraMyst> It feels like this game was made because they wanted to voice  everyone in some aspects. There are few points where this game falls short, but some of the best qualities are the voice acting
[2023-01-05 02:19:49] <zehdre> I love Hades' honesty and character development, would've been so easy to make him the typical stoic hardheaded antagonist
[2023-01-05 02:19:51] <+SevaraMyst> without a doubt

[2023-01-05 02:20:08] <dumbodumberson> @sleepingbag11 if they literally just make hades 1 but with new characters and innovate on gameplay, I think they're capable of pulling it off

[2023-01-05 02:21:51] <zehdre> @Flipnip_Slipgrip They said they'd share more details this year. She does have the same eye colors as Zag and her name is Melinoë which is another mythic figure with sparse information.

[2023-01-05 02:22:25] <littlepigb0i> except that there are already gods who were born after the death of the titans. i'm expecting it to be a groundhog day type situation, where cronos came back and fucked everything up with his time power

[2023-01-05 02:24:21] <%SteveSketches> So yeah, Hades has enough dialogue to match roughly 40% of the Bible.  That's a LOT of acting.
[2023-01-05 02:24:21] <sleepingbag11> Either horse or just migrating bulls or sth
[2023-01-05 02:24:39] <littlepigb0i> from the bow of rama it seemed more like a spanking than a rivalry, but ok

[2023-01-05 02:31:14] <zehdre> Some aspects are great at base, and some really only come online at full power
[2023-01-05 02:31:30] <!%Ebonslayer> @Oroboro Something you should know. To unlock hidden aspects you need to have invested 5 titan blood into it.

[2023-01-05 02:37:17] <+siscoross> just upgrades or bonus procs on ALL damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:22] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> Yes, but very little
[2023-01-05 02:37:23] <littlepigb0i> your attacks do deal damage yes
[2023-01-05 02:37:25] <+siscoross> yeah you still get base damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:26] <%nola_epeeist> It also doesn't stack with multiple sources of hangover
[2023-01-05 02:37:29] <zehdre> I mean yea your attacks always deal damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:29] <%nola_epeeist> you still do base damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:33] <+antoniodesandoli> yes
[2023-01-05 02:37:36] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> No just total damage like ruthless reflex increases its damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:43] <LoonyNo7> No, only anything that says purely 'Damage', so like absorbing the blast of the eris gun will boost it
[2023-01-05 02:37:44] <TheEnygma> no
[2023-01-05 02:37:44] <dumbodumberson> your attack applies the hangover and deals base damage, upgrading "Attack %" increases base damage but does nothing to hangover
[2023-01-05 02:37:44] <+haupty3> it also scales with total damage dealt effects
[2023-01-05 02:37:51] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> 1 would be best for the Arthur sword but here it's definitely the worst
[2023-01-05 02:37:51] <zehdre> Hangover only adds the poison effect, no % damage
[2023-01-05 02:37:51] <+SevaraMyst> You get instances of base damage, but the hangover damage is only scalable through poms @Oroboro
[2023-01-05 02:37:54] <%nola_epeeist> This chaos thing adds to base damage of fists not to hangover
[2023-01-05 02:38:00] <JTWhisper> its a stacking DoT
[2023-01-05 02:38:00] <dumbodumberson> the hangover boon also does not add attack damage
[2023-01-05 02:38:10] <dumbodumberson> getting attack % boost does nothing for the sake of hangover synergy
[2023-01-05 02:38:24] <dumbodumberson> think gouge build in ds1

[2023-01-05 02:39:42] <dumbodumberson> better to go for utility dash like poseidon for knockback damage or athena for reflext
[2023-01-05 02:39:51] <+Mota_J> worst dash in the game imo
[2023-01-05 02:39:53] <dumbodumberson> or blade dash for P O G F U N
[2023-01-05 02:40:00] <+siscoross> doom special or zeus with dio works great

[2023-01-05 02:40:18] <+Mota_J> tidal dash is 2 good
[2023-01-05 02:40:20] <dumbodumberson> it is undeniable the worst one but it is fun and cool so it's a valid choice
[2023-01-05 02:40:26] <%Flipnip_Slipgrip> Imo Poseidon's dash is best, closely followed by Athena.
[2023-01-05 02:40:34] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Yea demeter dash is pretty bad

[2023-01-05 02:50:16] <TheEnygma> support fire only works with fast attacking weapons like gun or fists, it sucks for charge bow

[2023-01-05 04:13:47] <tevitax> don't remember how to tho
[2023-01-05 04:13:59] <LilFoxPaws> it does
[2023-01-05 04:14:05] <Tylerjsmith97> you need specific boons iirc
[2023-01-05 04:14:16] <%Evil_on_Paper> Lava's still animating in the background
[2023-01-05 04:14:34] <LilFoxPaws> oh yeah you needed either his attack special or vengeance

[2023-01-05 04:15:15] <%SteveSketches> His special counts.
[2023-01-05 04:15:16] <tevitax> only curses
[2023-01-05 04:15:16] <LilFoxPaws> Ah not special
[2023-01-05 04:15:18] <Tylerjsmith97> VENGEANCE
[2023-01-05 04:15:19] <LilFoxPaws> I meant Call
[2023-01-05 04:15:24] <LilFoxPaws> Sorry
[2023-01-05 04:15:24] <SuburbanSocrates> The special does count. It's anything that inflicts Doom.
[2023-01-05 04:15:39] <shiftyhobbit> it's either the curse or slade rift themes
[2023-01-05 04:15:42] <SuburbanSocrates> Basically, you need something that inflicts doom and something that inflicts hangover.

[2023-01-05 04:37:33] <%theIMPimp> I would love to see how that's programmed, it effecting already existing effects is interesting
[2023-01-05 04:37:37] <Tylerjsmith97> you run so fucking fast
[2023-01-05 04:38:10] <+TheAssumingMage> Did flipnip tell you that too?
[2023-01-05 04:38:14] <%nola_epeeist> problem with hermes is that he has a ton of good stuff but hyoer hyper sprint + RD is the biggest damage buff in the game by far. So no matter your build, you always want thebsame the same thing as your first choice.
[2023-01-05 04:38:16] <SuburbanSocrates> Dying Lament is amazing on Styx. One rat dies; and it sets off a chain reaction.
[2023-01-05 04:38:18] <%$MrPwner911> @Oroboro bit of a harsh move to ban flip tbh
[2023-01-05 04:38:27] <%SteveSketches> Whenever I see Hermes I try to roll for Hyper+Rush.  The greeeeed

[2023-01-05 06:39:17] <Awwbriebrie> Problem is that they only stack 5 times

[2023-01-05 06:40:06] <Awwbriebrie> Also dumb question but what does dot stand for?
[2023-01-05 06:40:07] <%keeran8894> Dio dots require quite a bit to make it work. but the debuffs it applied along with the Dot can get juicy, not a bad support
[2023-01-05 06:40:15] <@%$gibbed> @Awwbriebrie damage over time
[2023-01-05 06:40:19] <+TheAssumingMage> calls can be pommed, and there are call charge increases
[2023-01-05 06:40:29] <%+GIHunter6> You gotta start running Priveleged Status.  Fast, easy 40% damage every fight vs having to spend the whole run trying to build up like 20-25%

[2023-01-05 06:49:10] <akmazero> i thought sisyphus was there for tricking hades or maybe thanatos
[2023-01-05 06:49:14] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> you know it feels so weird to me that I've never seen a roguelike where you can do runs with custom builds. obviously it wouldn't be as rewarding but simply testing out combos would be so much fun
[2023-01-05 06:49:49] <%OptPlaysGames> @zegreatpumpkinani custom mode in dead cells let you limit the item pool. kind of accomplishes that
[2023-01-05 06:49:53] <7stringarmy> ive never had any luck with dio attack as a main
[2023-01-05 06:49:56] <Imp_Loader> you got peer pressure, so thats already a victory.
[2023-01-05 06:49:56] <!%Ebonslayer> @ZeGreatPumpkinani That generally runs contrary to the ideas of a Roguelike.

[2023-01-05 06:49:59] <%+GIHunter6> Personally I use Dio Special and Demeter Attack on the Demeter Fists.  It's a pretty sick combo
[2023-01-05 06:50:06] <%keeran8894> ricochet and attack speed would be nice for that.
[2023-01-05 06:50:09] <Neaan> Dio is great on stuff like bow special.
[2023-01-05 06:50:16] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Dio special and arti main is my goto on Chiron bow
[2023-01-05 06:50:39] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> @ebonslayer yes, but it would be a separate game mode, like a training room
[2023-01-05 06:50:46] <%OptPlaysGames> I like forcing sea storm
[2023-01-05 06:50:58] <7stringarmy> I always have better builds focusing on the special for the gun
[2023-01-05 06:51:01] <%keeran8894> also the base rarity on the attack doesn{t help!
[2023-01-05 06:51:07] <chiyo721> I'm telling you, it's priv status lol
[2023-01-05 06:51:13] <%keeran8894> @7stringarmy same tbh
[2023-01-05 06:51:14] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> or they could do something like the challenge rooms in Transistor!
[2023-01-05 06:51:30] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> It deff is the weakest but I like it more than zeus attack

[2023-01-05 07:24:44] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> I don't really get Doom, it seems like just a damage buff with an annoying delay and can't stack with multi-hits
[2023-01-05 07:24:59] <RickyRelucent> you can delay it further for more dmg
[2023-01-05 07:25:12] <Hachiyon> fist is brutal LUL
[2023-01-05 07:25:14] <RickyRelucent> think there's a duo for that due
[2023-01-05 07:25:16] <Neaan> Then you get the mods that let you build up more doom and pop it with the special
[2023-01-05 07:25:18] <%OptPlaysGames> @zegreatpumpkinani I like it on slower attacks or chain shots
[2023-01-05 07:25:24] <RickyRelucent> but it requires weak/drunk
