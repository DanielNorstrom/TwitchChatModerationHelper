[2022-12-09 00:00:14] <%ikigami_ikigai> eo is the most piano class I've seen so far
[2022-12-09 00:00:15] VIEWERS: 594
[2022-12-09 00:00:25] <%ikigami_ikigai> and it's hard don't get me wrong
[2022-12-09 00:00:31] <%ikigami_ikigai> yeah
[2022-12-09 00:00:43] <Spaektrix> GroupJAM
[2022-12-09 00:00:46] <%+zeshlal> yeah it's not my dps that I'm concerned about, just that in order to be efficient you have to do ui exploit I dont like that, and the other engraving seems unfun
[2022-12-09 00:00:49] <%ikigami_ikigai> too much apm for me at least
[2022-12-09 00:00:54] <%ikigami_ikigai> can't do that shit
[2022-12-09 00:00:59] <%+zeshlal> EO hits cdr cap in hype 3 so yeah it's the most piano

[2022-12-09 00:01:33] <%ikigami_ikigai> still seems superfun tho
[2022-12-09 00:02:09] <%ikigami_ikigai> would be down to give it a try but I already got too many chars pepeW

[2022-12-09 00:02:20] <%Yomigaeru> go for a deadeye if you like high apm
[2022-12-09 00:02:27] <%+zeshlal> I wanna try deadeye as well ever since I learned it's entropy
[2022-12-09 00:02:31] <%polig> lets not build up my deadeye population!

[2022-12-09 00:02:40] <%ikigami_ikigai> deadeye is really nice
[2022-12-09 00:02:58] <%polig> i like it low :/
[2022-12-09 00:03:25] <%ikigami_ikigai> pistoleer def needs some love tho

[2022-12-09 00:08:31] <%+zeshlal> i think I want a roster of 6 back attackers
[2022-12-09 00:10:19] VIEWERS: 588
[2022-12-09 00:11:13] <%Yomigaeru> i'm curious, did you get the crystals you preordered like a week ago for 1850 gold?
[2022-12-09 00:11:19] <%polig> jokes aside pistol is not that bad, i started as pistol, one of the easiest back attack classes if not the easiest and way better to go pistol as low effort alt than ew, if you dont put the hours in ew u wont enjoy it
[2022-12-09 00:12:19] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-09 00:13:09] <%polig> if you cant maintain your position on the boss back end in like 5m arc 90% of the time you will be worst than ew
[2022-12-09 00:13:23] <%Yomigaeru> I once listed a 100% quality swift earring with desperate salvation 3 and awakening 5 for 2k, 'cause I wanted to list a relic stone for that price
[2022-12-09 00:13:39] <%Yomigaeru> luckily I realised that immediately.. monkaS
[2022-12-09 00:14:02] <%ikigami_ikigai> pistoleer is super underwhelming totally needs a number buff or a rework
[2022-12-09 00:14:19] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-09 00:14:23] <%Yomigaeru> yes, I got it back
[2022-12-09 00:14:26] <%Yomigaeru> sold it for 150k
[2022-12-09 00:14:27] <%polig> its boring for sure but i put in the hours so i can do EW but if you are more casual you are better off with pistol, that is the reason for pistol :)
[2022-12-09 00:15:11] <%ikigami_ikigai> pistol is nice and smooth all it wants is a buff
[2022-12-09 00:15:20] <%Yomigaeru> but holy, my pulse was never that high 'cause of lost ark like in that moment KEKW
[2022-12-09 00:16:08] <%polig> pistol will never be high dps so i doubt they buff it, too easy to play
[2022-12-09 00:16:19] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-09 00:16:44] <%polig> with that playstyle is set for mediocre dmg char
[2022-12-09 00:17:10] <%ikigami_ikigai> yeah but still needs more love
[2022-12-09 00:18:09] <%polig> but you are back attack main so EW is nearly as same just not as smooth as deathblade
[2022-12-09 00:18:20] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-09 00:18:39] <%polig> EW just needs love on movement skill not being so crp and more smooth,
[2022-12-09 00:18:53] <%Yomigaeru> @polig you really dislike them?
[2022-12-09 00:19:00] <%Yomigaeru> i think they're totally fine
[2022-12-09 00:19:03] <%ikigami_ikigai> yeah same
[2022-12-09 00:19:23] <%ikigami_ikigai> I play with 1 more movement skill in pistols and feels super mobile
[2022-12-09 00:19:35] <@%ragingqueen666> bakeHi

[2022-12-09 00:20:20] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-09 00:20:24] <%polig> deadeye has a lot of movements skill but neither of them as smooth as some classes which can jump over to other side of the boss and etc, that part i dislike, when you need to move around a boss in efficient manner they are not great
[2022-12-09 00:20:30] <%Yomigaeru> the only thing I dont like on ew deadeye is to counter, you dont wanna use your shotgun skill for it usually, but your pistol skill is so delayed ...
[2022-12-09 00:21:23] <%ikigami_ikigai> well there is ignore collision tripod on somersault shot but don't think it works like dark axel
[2022-12-09 00:21:45] <%ikigami_ikigai> or fiery escape
[2022-12-09 00:22:10] <%ikigami_ikigai> dark axel is premuim
