[2022-12-27 14:54:06] <glowtraq> bullied
[2022-12-27 14:54:06] <%GIRLinMaleBody> every tank is a fat dps
[2022-12-27 14:54:24] <%withmere> hog doesn't mitigate dmg
[2022-12-27 14:54:29] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he does
[2022-12-27 14:54:31] <%withmere> no matrix, no shield
[2022-12-27 14:54:42] <lhcloudy109> :)
[2022-12-27 14:54:43] <%+Aceattack> he does mitigate dmg by using breather
[2022-12-27 14:54:51] <%withmere> only for himself, not for team tho
[2022-12-27 14:55:01] <%withmere> i think tank should help mitigate dmg for the team
[2022-12-27 14:55:01] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he can bodyblock
[2022-12-27 14:55:07] <%withmere> so can brig

[2022-12-27 14:55:17] <%withmere> any hero can bodyblock

[2022-12-27 14:55:31] <%+Aceattack> he creates space which is what tank does
[2022-12-27 14:55:35] <%withmere> but any hero can body block lol

[2022-12-27 14:56:41] <%+Aceattack> all these excuses carry on from ow1. hog is a tank. every tank uses their abilities primarily for themselves including shield and dm
[2022-12-27 14:57:01] <%+Aceattack> hog does dmg mitigating by killing their backline ez
[2022-12-27 14:57:13] <%withmere> can't do dmg if ur dead

[2022-12-27 16:04:56] <@^Nightbot> I saw Cloudy in a 4K lobby one time. I told him how cool it was to meet him in game, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for friend request or anything. He said, “Oh, sr peak check?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” while using the “No” voiceline repeatedly.

[2022-12-27 16:08:41] <+chorklit> @a_flaccid_bird what was different about valk at release?
[2022-12-27 16:09:07] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ulting reset her rez, she could rez two
[2022-12-27 16:09:12] <+a_flaccid_bird> it refreshed her res and was instant

[2022-12-27 16:09:40] <%GIRLinMaleBody> dunno
[2022-12-27 16:09:45] <%GIRLinMaleBody> was it also faster pistol shooting
[2022-12-27 16:09:50] <@%aidreu> Oh yeah LOL
[2022-12-27 16:09:50] <+a_flaccid_bird> was it 20 sec or always 15?

[2022-12-27 16:10:08] <+chorklit> faster pistol shooting i think i'd be ok with but resetting rez is a bit too good, so is multi man rez

[2022-12-27 16:11:05] <+a_flaccid_bird> and I believe res was on a faster cd while in Valk so she could theoretically rez twice in valk
[2022-12-27 16:11:08] <@%aidreu> Yea def check out mercy old ult, it’s so diff from now

[2022-12-27 17:51:51] <Ichonix> maybe tanks shouldn't have the 30% ult thing to reduce counter picking
[2022-12-27 17:52:25] <%needabetterpig> @girlinmalebody just go echo or hitscan p much. in higher elo phara isn't that great anyways since most will be able to beam her down
[2022-12-27 17:52:32] <+Xeffary> counter picking is based bro, the more flexible tank should be rewarded
[2022-12-27 17:52:42] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @needabetterpig pharah just hard rolled last game
[2022-12-27 17:52:44] <+Xeffary> the problem is that each season everyone just counterpicks until they end up on a hero with no counter

[2022-12-27 19:13:23] <%thowren> do you think zarya and winston beats orisa
[2022-12-27 19:13:25] <ghawi2001> maybe nerf fortify a lil bit but honestly if they just increase all cooldowns it'll be ok

[2022-12-27 19:14:09] <boggleJR> the duration nerf was okay but the cool down nerf was overboard
[2022-12-27 19:14:20] <SSWaterWorld> yeah you don't even see zarya in ladder like no zarya in their top 3 played tanks
[2022-12-27 19:14:33] <%thowren> zarya is zarya XD

[2022-12-27 19:15:37] <%thowren> since normally u wanna spin fortify spin but zarya ignores spin and can push her out
[2022-12-27 19:16:16] <SSWaterWorld> do you think rein is good this season because I heard some say he's bad but I had no problems climbing back to my peak at the beginning of the season
[2022-12-27 19:16:18] <%thowren> maybe at lower ranks yea
[2022-12-27 19:16:31] <ghawi2001> I think zarya not that bad against orisa
[2022-12-27 19:16:31] <%thowren> but like u say at low rank everything works

[2022-12-27 19:28:22] <lusterfury_ow> i have no idea. what im guessing is the hanzo registered as a wall to "pin" against but did 0 damage cause its a player and tracer was able to be unstunned and recall. my best guess.
