[2022-12-27 14:53:56] <%withmere> @lhcloudy109 he's a fat dps hero, not a tank
[2022-12-27 14:54:06] <glowtraq> bullied
[2022-12-27 14:54:06] <%GIRLinMaleBody> every tank is a fat dps
[2022-12-27 14:54:24] <%withmere> hog doesn't mitigate dmg
[2022-12-27 14:54:29] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he does
[2022-12-27 14:54:31] <%withmere> no matrix, no shield
[2022-12-27 14:54:42] <lhcloudy109> :)
[2022-12-27 14:54:43] <%+Aceattack> he does mitigate dmg by using breather
[2022-12-27 14:54:51] <%withmere> only for himself, not for team tho
[2022-12-27 14:55:01] <%withmere> i think tank should help mitigate dmg for the team
[2022-12-27 14:55:01] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he can bodyblock
[2022-12-27 14:55:07] <%withmere> so can brig
[2022-12-27 14:55:08] <%emreHakan> @GIRLinMaleBody bruh
[2022-12-27 14:55:17] <%withmere> any hero can bodyblock
[2022-12-27 14:55:26] <%GIRLinMaleBody> u said hog cant, hog acn
[2022-12-27 14:55:26] <%withmere> i've seen mercy's body block ulting pharahs
[2022-12-27 14:55:31] <%+Aceattack> he creates space which is what tank does
[2022-12-27 14:55:35] <%withmere> but any hero can body block lol
[2022-12-27 14:55:46] <%GIRLinMaleBody> mercy doesnt have 700 hp and breather

[2022-12-27 14:56:41] <%+Aceattack> all these excuses carry on from ow1. hog is a tank. every tank uses their abilities primarily for themselves including shield and dm
[2022-12-27 14:57:01] <%+Aceattack> hog does dmg mitigating by killing their backline ez
[2022-12-27 14:57:13] <%withmere> can't do dmg if ur dead

[2022-12-27 14:57:19] <%withmere> i guess sojourn mitigates a lot of dmg

[2022-12-27 16:04:56] <@^Nightbot> I saw Cloudy in a 4K lobby one time. I told him how cool it was to meet him in game, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for friend request or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, sr peak check?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù while using the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù voiceline repeatedly.

[2022-12-27 16:08:41] <+chorklit> @a_flaccid_bird what was different about valk at release?
[2022-12-27 16:09:07] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ulting reset her rez, she could rez two
[2022-12-27 16:09:12] <+a_flaccid_bird> it refreshed her res and was instant
[2022-12-27 16:09:23] <+chorklit> oh hell no that sucks, forget that
[2022-12-27 16:09:24] <@%aidreu> It also lasted longer right

[2022-12-27 16:09:40] <%GIRLinMaleBody> dunno
[2022-12-27 16:09:45] <%GIRLinMaleBody> was it also faster pistol shooting
[2022-12-27 16:09:50] <@%aidreu> Oh yeah LOL
[2022-12-27 16:09:50] <+a_flaccid_bird> was it 20 sec or always 15?
[2022-12-27 16:09:56] <warab8> thank u mister cloudy i got my drop
[2022-12-27 16:09:57] <@%aidreu> was it infinite ammo??
[2022-12-27 16:10:00] <%GIRLinMaleBody> they like nerfed her dps side of ult

[2022-12-27 16:10:08] <+chorklit> faster pistol shooting i think i'd be ok with but resetting rez is a bit too good, so is multi man rez
[2022-12-27 16:10:10] <@%aidreu> It was 20s before I think

[2022-12-27 16:10:52] <+chorklit> @aidreu i started in like late 2019? around the time baptiste was released
[2022-12-27 16:11:05] <+a_flaccid_bird> and I believe res was on a faster cd while in Valk so she could theoretically rez twice in valk
[2022-12-27 16:11:08] <@%aidreu> Yea def check out mercy old ult, it‚Äôs so diff from now

[2022-12-27 17:51:32] <%needabetterpig> @girlinmalebody it's not the tanks job

[2022-12-27 17:51:51] <Ichonix> maybe tanks shouldn't have the 30% ult thing to reduce counter picking
[2022-12-27 17:52:25] <%needabetterpig> @girlinmalebody just go echo or hitscan p much. in higher elo phara isn't that great anyways since most will be able to beam her down
[2022-12-27 17:52:32] <+Xeffary> counter picking is based bro, the more flexible tank should be rewarded
[2022-12-27 17:52:42] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @needabetterpig pharah just hard rolled last game
[2022-12-27 17:52:44] <+Xeffary> the problem is that each season everyone just counterpicks until they end up on a hero with no counter

[2022-12-27 19:10:36] <+xercen> Are you going to be playing on both Reinhart and Ramattra equally in the future, or will you tend towards a particular character?
[2022-12-27 19:10:56] <%+thelastp0rg> What would you do to balance Orisa? Increase cooldowns?
[2022-12-27 19:11:19] VIEWERS: 498
[2022-12-27 19:11:25] <ghawi2001> increase every cooldown by like a second and she's ok
[2022-12-27 19:11:33] <+xercen> Apart from Roadhog, which are the strongest tanks in the current meta?
[2022-12-27 19:12:19] <+chesly_vakarian> spin is already defense matrix tier powerful for a tank ability fortify is  a bit much on top of that
[2022-12-27 19:12:33] <ghawi2001> definitely stronger than hog rn
[2022-12-27 19:12:46] <LOOT_BACK> fortify lasts too long
[2022-12-27 19:13:08] <%tokekberacun> the only counter is mirror the orisa
[2022-12-27 19:13:11] <%tokekberacun> kinda

[2022-12-27 19:13:23] <%thowren> do you think zarya and winston beats orisa
[2022-12-27 19:13:25] <ghawi2001> maybe nerf fortify a lil bit but honestly if they just increase all cooldowns it'll be ok

[2022-12-27 19:14:20] <SSWaterWorld> yeah you don't even see zarya in ladder like no zarya in their top 3 played tanks
[2022-12-27 19:14:33] <%thowren> zarya is zarya XD

[2022-12-27 19:16:31] <ghawi2001> I think zarya not that bad against orisa
[2022-12-27 19:16:31] <%thowren> but like u say at low rank everything works
