[2022-12-17 00:13:26] <cablamo1> @SKCynical what do u mean overtuned? it scales

[2022-12-17 00:15:08] <+SKCynical> There seems a lot more interrupts needed in these dungeons compared to previous expansions
[2022-12-17 00:16:12] <%Inferus> damn this is cozy
[2022-12-17 00:16:14] <TurriNn> @SKCynical Also mobs tend to have more AoE based abilites, it looks like they are trying to prevent giga pulls
[2022-12-17 00:16:45] <theonlylapest> This is so overpull
[2022-12-17 00:16:46] <+SKCynical> @turrinn yeah that’s what I thought, aoe damage and each mob in like a pack of 4 needs interrupting
[2022-12-17 00:17:26] <+Lynasz> Druid is my friend! happy to see her playing with noawh POGCHAMP
[2022-12-17 00:17:28] <TurriNn> @SKCynical Went in a dungeon where tank pulled like 4 packs and the rest of the group including me died before we made to his tanking spot because of AoE Sadge

[2022-12-17 00:18:48] <TurriNn> @SKCynical Yeah exactly my thinking, everyone is most likely still used to the huge SL pulls but overall M+ feels more challenging, at least in my eyes
[2022-12-17 00:19:08] <mvpforthewin11> is there a command to see what stat is naowh is using ?
