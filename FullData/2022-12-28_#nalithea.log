[2022-12-28 14:05:10] <%prankbg> so to sum it up to be a mod for nali you have to moderate twitch chat, moderate discord, make twitch clips and bunch of other stuf. do i got it correct
[2022-12-28 14:05:16] <@%Grimstab77> yeah stressing about numbers is never healthy.
[2022-12-28 14:05:35] <@%Borky97> @prankbg that and also be a nice person and respect

[2022-12-28 14:06:58] <@%Grimstab77> @Xx_Queenie_Xx understandable. The reason I'm streaming is just to share my gameplay and have some fun. I don't care if I have no viewer. Which is the case 95% of my streams :D

[2022-12-28 14:08:54] <%Xx_Queenie_Xx> @grimstab77 best way to be! That’s how I started and I loved it but I lost the reason why I started and too much internet drama. I just wanted to have fun.
