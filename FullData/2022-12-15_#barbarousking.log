[2022-12-15 17:18:13] <%+Leo_Fara> NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:18:14] <%snoops_kush> lame
[2022-12-15 17:18:15] <hankhillspancakedumper> you are technically in normal mode dude
[2022-12-15 17:18:16] <upyu> You dont need to kill everything
[2022-12-15 17:18:17] <%tenebrity> and you get to do the challenging part once
[2022-12-15 17:18:17] <$Overroid> Stop going so slow and move faster, like dark souls
[2022-12-15 17:18:19] <%$Big_Weez> Diablo 3 same vibe
[2022-12-15 17:18:20] <%+SigmaMonkee> "It starts to get good on NG+5"
[2022-12-15 17:18:21] <+Apothecarried> poe is such ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-15 17:18:25] <%bware001> Boring games
[2022-12-15 17:18:27] <%toxicpycnometer> OH BOY
[2022-12-15 17:18:27] <%waywardfrantz> you would love Diablo 3 so much more
[2022-12-15 17:18:27] <%$ParAilurus> that's why so many people like it
[2022-12-15 17:18:29] <+Pemavide> ng+7 is the real challenge
[2022-12-15 17:18:29] <%Crizzle777> it takes some people 1 day to get to the endgame, you just play too slow
[2022-12-15 17:18:29] <%SparoHawk> @BarbarousKing Sadly the real challenge starts at end game. And no, at the pace you are going you'll need about another 50-60 hours. barbKEKD
[2022-12-15 17:18:30] <$yasarumit> I want to die too Smoge
[2022-12-15 17:18:30] <%$AlwaysAtlas> Is no one good enough to face me barbChad

[2022-12-15 17:18:39] <%+Lolwutkkz> lol rip Barb when he hits maps
[2022-12-15 17:18:40] <%toxicpycnometer> most people reach your point in the sotry after 5
[2022-12-15 17:18:40] <%deadlast13> so true
[2022-12-15 17:18:40] <%Yorckus_IV> Did you play Knights of Honor back in the day? After 15 years they made Knights of Honor 2, its something between Medieval: Total War and Crusader Kings
[2022-12-15 17:18:44] <%numynu> except Nioh 2
[2022-12-15 17:18:44] <EmbersColby> You full-cleared a few areas early on, and it overleveled you (not unexpected for a first time)
[2022-12-15 17:18:44] <%+AntogLvl99Lgnd> Barb, play Diablo III and you can set the difficulty to obscene levels from the start
[2022-12-15 17:18:46] <%$lansiar> I was kind of shocked you got so sucked into that one, but it's also not my kind of game
[2022-12-15 17:18:49] <%JK_Guys> What game?
[2022-12-15 17:18:49] <%Mr_Panda> youre just super overleveled
[2022-12-15 17:18:49] <TheRealChilltronic> M&B2 reminded me of Dynasty Warriors a bit
[2022-12-15 17:18:49] <%Evergreen_VG> Dude, NG+7 is when things get INSANE
[2022-12-15 17:18:50] <+Cyg2112> That was the Moonlighter post-game for me. Just seemed like a mindless grind
[2022-12-15 17:18:50] <%+Lolwutkkz> @barbarousking what act are you even in?
[2022-12-15 17:18:50] <%Raikk0u> poe players would seethe and cope if you said their game is easy
[2022-12-15 17:18:51] <+h0tpancakes> yeah in ARPGs end game is where the "game begins" its not for everyone for sure
[2022-12-15 17:18:53] <%+SpiralusD> @BarbarousKing this is why I play on hardcore because the thought of dieing makes you think way harder on doing stuff
[2022-12-15 17:18:54] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> the genre is built around it being easy at the start and ball punching at the end so that it hooks you early
[2022-12-15 17:18:57] <%hoodlumroyalty> needs a learning curve
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <ultimike123> kinda like one peice, "it gets good after ep. 2000"
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <%bware001> I’m excited to see barb’s next addiction
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <%BlindRattlesnake> def
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <%+Thorsad> your progress is slow, honestly you should be past act 2 in 3 hour
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <%+SigmaMonkee> yes
[2022-12-15 17:18:58] <$Overroid> Instead of play 100 hours just go faster, stop killing everything
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%chillsalmon> ye
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%$ParAilurus> yes
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <iqmqsd> Play 5000 league of legends games and be stuck in bronze LULW
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <LINKTNPAST> it is
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%snoops_kush> yes
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%imisgrunbula> it is
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%tenebrity> No, it makes sense.
[2022-12-15 17:19:01] <%+Nico_kami> Games like that want you rush to the endgame cycle where things actually get hard. They don't expect you spend a ton of time in the precursor section. It sucks, but that's just how the genre is.
[2022-12-15 17:19:02] <%$MossBeard> Someone that knows what there doing would be where you are in an hour, not saying thats a good thing
[2022-12-15 17:19:02] <%+SilverbackGrappler> @BarbarousKing do yourself a favour and don't full clear. PoE is not a game about exploring
[2022-12-15 17:19:02] <%KoJi_64> NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:19:03] <%midwestgamer69> barbCheat
[2022-12-15 17:19:03] <tg_emc> Yes. It makes complete sense
[2022-12-15 17:19:03] <%+Healthier> yes, and taht's why i knew you wouldn't like PoE
[2022-12-15 17:19:04] <jayzororck> you are saying you are bored
[2022-12-15 17:19:05] <%+TalonXV> Yes and no.  From a first play through you are right, but average time is 8-10 hours to the end game...And thats where new player experience differs
[2022-12-15 17:19:06] <%SparoHawk> I've always said the devs should give the option to jump into the endgame ASAP. Like you do in D3.
[2022-12-15 17:19:06] <%toxicpycnometer> still in the prologue
[2022-12-15 17:19:07] <+bigbigtaco> So we playing marbles tonight?
[2022-12-15 17:19:09] <%Fandango101> The games are for grinding mostly
[2022-12-15 17:19:10] <%+Papa_TheBard> the genre isnt for everyone
[2022-12-15 17:19:11] <upyu> You should not kill everything.
[2022-12-15 17:19:12] <hankhillspancakedumper> You're in normal Barb lmao
[2022-12-15 17:19:12] <%snoops_kush> you're just a god gamer
[2022-12-15 17:19:12] <%waywardfrantz> absolutely it's the same way Diablo 2 work so they copied the same mistake in order to soothe people's nostalgia
[2022-12-15 17:19:14] <Fingoltin> @Lolwutkkz very beginning of act 3, he goes through entire maps and kills everything so he's a few levels over
[2022-12-15 17:19:14] <theBonestorm> I enjoy those games, but surprised you played as much as you did
[2022-12-15 17:19:15] <dye_clc> yep i found the game so esay that i quit
[2022-12-15 17:19:18] <+SQL_Infection> I felt the same in Diablo, I think it's the genre
[2022-12-15 17:19:18] <%ayyyyy_brewbacca> @bigbigtaco bold statement cotton
[2022-12-15 17:19:19] <%Sch1ey> there is a large spike in the final act but I 100% agree
[2022-12-15 17:19:22] <%JK_Guys> POE?
[2022-12-15 17:19:24] <+veddy0> challenging: press 1 button
[2022-12-15 17:19:27] <kirby_kingdom> GIGACHAD
[2022-12-15 17:19:28] <%+Lord_Suiadan> It does make sense. I grew up playing the genre, so I enjoy it but can understand what you are saying.
[2022-12-15 17:19:28] <upyu> just run through until you catch up in enemy level
[2022-12-15 17:19:28] <%$EverytimeDave> I have the same complaint with the genre. It’s boring forever and then you have to minmax micromanage which also isn’t fun
[2022-12-15 17:19:28] <%snoops_kush> NOW Madge
[2022-12-15 17:19:29] <%+SilverbackGrappler> play Ruthless mode then
[2022-12-15 17:19:30] <+TurfTuna> elden ring ruined games, nothing is challenging anymore
[2022-12-15 17:19:31] <$BlackTieBlackSuit> i just think barb is picking the wrong class...
[2022-12-15 17:19:32] <%indieage> so play 29h
[2022-12-15 17:19:33] <%BlindRattlesnake> barbs a gamers
[2022-12-15 17:19:33] <%toxicpycnometer> play ruthless then
[2022-12-15 17:19:34] <%$KingNurN> I heard someone say this is a better odd sands. Is that true?
[2022-12-15 17:19:36] <%+Smartoss> Yeah most ARPG's are easy to start, then get tougher and require more farming/grinding
[2022-12-15 17:19:38] <sim_maroon> Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-15 17:19:41] <+veddy0> challenging: spam same 1 spell
[2022-12-15 17:19:41] <%+SpiralusD> yeah you gotta play hardcore on poe to really feel it
[2022-12-15 17:19:42] <%$AlwaysAtlas> Ask hob how he makes everything a challenge hobbPag
[2022-12-15 17:19:42] <$Xelaxon> I'd say next act probably
[2022-12-15 17:19:45] <%+yooper8246> Anybody surprised Amazon is making a live action God of War show??

[2022-12-15 17:19:46] <%bware001> I’ve been playing Metroid dread and it’s so damn hard
[2022-12-15 17:19:47] <LINKTNPAST> we should tell the game to Be Better
[2022-12-15 17:19:47] <Fingoltin> @KingNurN not at all
[2022-12-15 17:19:48] <%THEchallengephase> ey barb barbKEKD
[2022-12-15 17:19:49] <+TurfTuna> i know :)
[2022-12-15 17:19:50] <%$z9d0> Diablo 2 is the same thing. Normal and Nightmare are easy as hell
[2022-12-15 17:19:51] <hicoder1352> i thought poe was boring and stopped playing after an hour
[2022-12-15 17:19:52] <Count_de_Ville> The game really picks up after 50 hours and you you complete your Master's Thesis on it
[2022-12-15 17:19:53] <theBonestorm> Even the challenge isn't the type that you normally seem to enjoy, which more interactive gameplay
[2022-12-15 17:19:57] <ljr991> it's a problem with a lot of grind heavy games where the challenge is non-existent for most of the game to draw in the most amount of players
[2022-12-15 17:19:58] <%JetsTheChamp> picks the strongest class. gets great uniques. complains game is to ez lol
[2022-12-15 17:19:58] <%$AlwaysAtlas> OOOO
[2022-12-15 17:19:59] <%+Parvovec> If you want challenge immediately, play risk of rain 2 KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:20:02] <%Sch1ey> there where challenging games before souls games too
[2022-12-15 17:20:04] <$mattdiesel69> hoooooooly shit
[2022-12-15 17:20:04] <DJ_Happy_Accidents> @bware001 dread is such a good game
[2022-12-15 17:20:04] <%snoops_kush> progress
[2022-12-15 17:20:06] <%+GaimeGuy> Yoshi looks a little ill
[2022-12-15 17:20:09] <%midwestgamer69> oooo
[2022-12-15 17:20:09] <%+Lolwutkkz> @barbarousking so they are reworking the acts to be more challenging, but she to their skeleton crew I think only act 1 & 2 have been revamped. But yes the game ramps in difficulty very quick later on!
[2022-12-15 17:20:10] <%$KingNurN> @fingoltin yo whats up dude
[2022-12-15 17:20:12] <%+casteia> it's a Yoshi with a Yoshi ass on it's head... wierd
[2022-12-15 17:20:13] <$Xelaxon> act 3 kinda is trivial, they haven't updated it in like 8 years
[2022-12-15 17:20:14] <%KoJi_64> ooooo neat
[2022-12-15 17:20:16] <%+knell_death> so its the genre
[2022-12-15 17:20:23] <%+tehcactusplant> Is... Is yoshi eating ass?
[2022-12-15 17:20:23] <iqmqsd> @TurfTuna I actually agree, after dark souls, playing any adventure game seems extremely boring because of no challenges
[2022-12-15 17:20:25] <%+Eightyeye> adding the extra 5 acts did make the campaign much easier
[2022-12-15 17:20:26] <ostincoolston> It's a butt faced Yoshi
[2022-12-15 17:20:28] <%Buflen> i quit FF14 because of that

[2022-12-15 17:20:38] <%Buflen> took forever to get hard or interesting
[2022-12-15 17:20:38] <+h4kuh4ku> challenges of wit, dexxterity and skill have been around long before the souls games
[2022-12-15 17:20:41] <%Evergreen_VG> I love games that force me to learn their mechanics to succeed
[2022-12-15 17:20:41] <%+yooper8246> Barb wants a game to kick him in the dick immediately
[2022-12-15 17:20:45] <%SuperMegaMimi> Barb have you tried Pokémon scarlet/violet? That’s challenging.
[2022-12-15 17:20:45] <%+jwowillo> There are other games in that genre (diablo 3) that actually have difficulty settings
[2022-12-15 17:20:45] <%$EdgeCloud777> also souls games were not the original hard games. The orginal Nintendo is known for having games that still are pretty challenging
[2022-12-15 17:20:50] <%+ConvictHam> I would like to dedicate this message to my former reformed orthodox rabbi Bill clinton
[2022-12-15 17:20:50] <leakypt> they make games for game-journalists nowadays
[2022-12-15 17:20:51] <%darthbane83> you could try the ruthless mode in path of exile, but thats really the "lmao get fucked" mode and it will challenge you in act 1 aswell
[2022-12-15 17:20:51] <$BlackTieBlackSuit> is there anyway in lunar magic to fix that yoshi sprite bug Barb ?
[2022-12-15 17:20:52] <%+Deadlyrage1989> you can get one shot by fodder in the endgame
[2022-12-15 17:20:53] <%midwestgamer69> lol
[2022-12-15 17:20:55] <%+GaimeGuy> KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:20:59] <+LeroyGankins> PoE is designed currently in softcore to be played witha guide. Run through the acts as fast as possible, to gear up for endgame. Learning from scratch is not the intended experience. Ruthless is honestly probably more of what you're looking for, its masively slowed down and less loot
[2022-12-15 17:20:59] <%+LaLiLupin> can you change difficulty like in diablo
[2022-12-15 17:20:59] <%+carcaussa> if a game doesn’t provide challenge for one hour, for me it means that I reached end-game scenario
[2022-12-15 17:21:00] <Aggressively_Beta> All CBT, no foreplay, got it NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:21:04] <%earlofpeeshire> tbh you picked the tankiest class
[2022-12-15 17:21:06] <hankhillspancakedumper> The stronger you are in that type of game the betterr..............you get items faster lmao
[2022-12-15 17:21:08] <iqmqsd> @BlackTieBlackSuit you need a patch, not lunar magic

[2022-12-15 17:21:11] <%$goodwaon> yep
[2022-12-15 17:21:11] <%SparoHawk> @Lolwutkkz Not really. Only maybe Kitava could pose a challenge. But the game is not a challenged if you are overleveled by ~10-20 levels.
[2022-12-15 17:21:12] <%$TacoBarato> another streamer I watch feels the same about "playing X hours to get to the stuff is bs" :)
[2022-12-15 17:21:13] <%$z9d0> It's about loot
[2022-12-15 17:21:14] <%Crizzle777> Yes
[2022-12-15 17:21:14] <%BlindRattlesnake> it certainly is
[2022-12-15 17:21:14] <%+SigmaMonkee> numbers go brrrr
[2022-12-15 17:21:16] <Kinghorn> mhmm
[2022-12-15 17:21:16] <%Evergreen_VG> @edgecloud777 It goes even further back than that - arcade games could be brutal AF
[2022-12-15 17:21:17] <%$goodwaon> number go up = dopamine go upp
[2022-12-15 17:21:18] <%Mr_Panda> i just dont think you understand the genre so much
[2022-12-15 17:21:19] <%$ParAilurus> yeah most people who love that kind of game like the number shit
[2022-12-15 17:21:21] <%de_surge> its a power fantasy
[2022-12-15 17:21:21] <%+chr1s1986> its all about item collecting
[2022-12-15 17:21:22] <%+Luko_Varius> yeah kind of game that challange goes in end game
[2022-12-15 17:21:28] <%$parael24601> what game we talking about?
[2022-12-15 17:21:29] <%$banana_peel2> poe has a big problem with faceless trash that has no impact on the challenge
[2022-12-15 17:21:31] <%$Drabillord> i assume the late game is probably grindy?
[2022-12-15 17:21:31] <%+TheGreatWalrusini> yes, it's all about getting better trouser, so you can get better trousers
[2022-12-15 17:21:32] <%SuperMegaMimi> Agreed
[2022-12-15 17:21:33] <$Overroid> Dark Souls is too easy when I farm enemies *facepalm*
[2022-12-15 17:21:33] <EmbersColby> play hardcore ruthless lol
[2022-12-15 17:21:34] <$Xelaxon> majority of monsters are fodder, only rares and bosses are the only threat
[2022-12-15 17:21:34] <+TurfTuna> right its too braindead at times
[2022-12-15 17:21:36] <%$EdgeCloud777> @Evergreen_VG true
[2022-12-15 17:21:40] <%com_poser> @BlackTieBlackSuit this is purposefully a "vanilla" hack, Yoshi's sprite slot is dynamic and so when a new Yoshi hatches it overwrites the slot for the grown Yoshi with the baby Yoshi gayDesiGraph
[2022-12-15 17:21:41] <%+DokuHimora> so does that mean no more POE?
[2022-12-15 17:21:41] <%BlindRattlesnake> it's not hard it's just about how much time you put into it

[2022-12-15 17:21:50] <Dhulz> @earlofpeeshire class has absolutely no meaning when he's overleveled by 8 levels in act 2
[2022-12-15 17:21:51] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> i think he understands the genre pretty good, just doesnt like it
[2022-12-15 17:21:51] <%imisgrunbula> what I'm seeing from the comments here is that PoE game design is stupid
[2022-12-15 17:21:52] <%craigx_89> Yeah. It not being right for him doesn’t mean he doesn’t understand it
[2022-12-15 17:21:52] <bolthus> I think the embedded player base just want to be max level as fast as possible so they can play the endgame
[2022-12-15 17:21:54] <+Ariose999> so what easy game are we talking about?
[2022-12-15 17:21:55] <%$Melkog> oh, path of exile
[2022-12-15 17:21:55] <Fishbulb07> So Old School Runescape may not be the game for you either?
[2022-12-15 17:21:56] <%$z9d0> He understands the genre... he doesn't like the genre lol
[2022-12-15 17:21:57] <%+justgamesville> thats the genre tho barbShrug
[2022-12-15 17:21:57] <%hogjosh> try ruthless mode maybe?
[2022-12-15 17:21:58] <%+Eightyeye> but that would also make alot of people leave the game
[2022-12-15 17:21:59] <%$AlwaysAtlas> Jebaited
[2022-12-15 17:22:01] <%+Lolwutkkz> @barbarousking in all honestly you will never be focused on dodging stuff in that game, except for bosses
[2022-12-15 17:22:01] <%Yorckus_IV> Did you play Knights of Honor back in the day? After 15 years they made Knights of Honor 2, its something between Medieval: Total War and Crusader Kings
[2022-12-15 17:22:02] <%DarkScarletMage> peepoTantrum but Barb just do the fart wipe mechanic and the game gets harder
[2022-12-15 17:22:02] <%keith46256> my friends grind monster hunter and diablo, and I just cannot for the life of me understand why
[2022-12-15 17:22:06] <%JetsTheChamp> @BarbarousKing than you should have made a glass cannon build
[2022-12-15 17:22:06] <thegoldendonger> yah poe is very boring to me as well, you run through everything smashing one skill
[2022-12-15 17:22:07] <BasedWindu> Literally play d3 then. You can start on harder difficulty
[2022-12-15 17:22:08] <+h4kuh4ku> it's sounds like  grinder for casual players to enjoy
[2022-12-15 17:22:09] <%$TacoBarato> this section barbGPW3
[2022-12-15 17:22:10] <%+BobSacamano___> Path of exile doesn't ever really challenge the player to get better. The scaling of enemies just gets higher and higher. It is all about building your character to deal with that not playing better
[2022-12-15 17:22:13] <%+yooper8246> But after the 45 minute tutorial though right?
[2022-12-15 17:22:14] <%Mr_Panda> well, you're going really slow to be fair, that's cool if you like that, but you can zoom zoom around
[2022-12-15 17:22:14] <+ThymeLord22> Not everyone enjoys a steep difficulty curve
[2022-12-15 17:22:15] <%UndefinedOrb> that's the genre and it's okay if it's not for you
[2022-12-15 17:22:17] <%+Coach_Kraken> Why’d you quit mount and blade?
[2022-12-15 17:22:18] <%+juannaga> yeah like eventually running around and smashing everything gets boring
[2022-12-15 17:22:18] <Kalrok> its kinda you like the grind or not its not so hard haHAA
[2022-12-15 17:22:20] <$mattdiesel69> so you had to feed the half yoshi to the full yoshi the whole time. machinoHmm
[2022-12-15 17:22:22] <$BlackTieBlackSuit> @BarbarousKing 2 things that may chage POE: Your class is TANKY AF cus your good at games. and the game gets harder when you play with people. You are however 100% right in your opinion
[2022-12-15 17:22:22] <+DarStarcrusher> you were lvl 29 when you got to act 3.. you were literally 7 levels over leveled
[2022-12-15 17:22:26] <%+Khargg> Isn't there a hard mode in Path of Exile now ?
[2022-12-15 17:22:27] <+veddy0> devs figured that once players play 30 hours they have no choice but to spend $30 on skins :)
[2022-12-15 17:22:28] <main_course> finish the game and try to say its easy
[2022-12-15 17:22:28] <$NullNRG> Guys, MARBLES is so hard and challenging immediately. it's sooo tough. barb should play marbles
[2022-12-15 17:22:30] <%Crizzle777> you're way too underleveled because you played too long in te starter areas
[2022-12-15 17:22:30] <%$crackawhat> @keith46256 i got a buddy with over 10k hours in POE. some people love just chillin and grindin
[2022-12-15 17:22:31] <%+Parvovec> Barb what did you think about Risk of Rain 2?
[2022-12-15 17:22:31] <%snoops_kush> barb needs a real challenge
[2022-12-15 17:22:35] <%Crizzle777> You're meant to lbow past that
[2022-12-15 17:22:35] <Ainrave_> @BarbarousKing there is a new gameplay mode ruthless that makes the game a lot harder, maybe try that?
[2022-12-15 17:22:38] <TheTwitcherlll> KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:22:38] <%Mr_Panda> you're like 12 levels over monster level
[2022-12-15 17:22:40] <tg_emc> Barb, the majority of this chat has a singular wrinkle on their brain. They can't comprehend that it's not fun grinding for 100 hours to finally have fun. It's a lost battle and war.

[2022-12-15 17:38:35] <%RoccoLetsPoop> barg isn't wrong about PoE
[2022-12-15 17:38:39] <bluefaintingpig> 1 king, 5000 troops, 1 black casting couch... I'd watch it
[2022-12-15 17:38:43] <%$TheFreakingPope> @tenlittlepiggies Invade Russia during winter
[2022-12-15 17:38:43] <%+Omiweapon> is there a way to adjust the difficulty in PoE?
[2022-12-15 17:38:46] <valkaline> In our lifetime we're probably going to get some legitimately good AI in videos games.
[2022-12-15 17:38:47] <%+tenlittlepiggies> Lmao barb trolling the poe diehards
[2022-12-15 17:38:51] <%waywardfrantz> Diablo 3 you can crank the difficulty from the beginning and you get a wide variety of fun moves. just saying
[2022-12-15 17:38:51] <%psyco_oe> POE is typically steam rolling things and then dying in one shot
[2022-12-15 17:38:54] <%$gumnas> I feel like the beginning is really cool and the feeling of progression makes you playing but it eventually becomes too repetitive.
[2022-12-15 17:38:54] <theBonestorm> Barb was an instant POE genius and stomped all over the game
[2022-12-15 17:38:57] <jkro_> Path has training wheels till act 7
[2022-12-15 17:38:58] <%$TWCblank> @Omiweapon not really, but you can play permadeath mode
[2022-12-15 17:39:00] <%+Beefyfife> Barb, at what point do you just start killing nobels so they can’t reform fractured armies into the 1000 to 1500 armies roaming around

[2022-12-15 17:39:02] <%$AlwaysAtlas> barbChad
[2022-12-15 17:39:02] <RockyAce01> POE is very easy until endgame
[2022-12-15 17:39:06] <%ayyyyy_brewbacca> @BarbarousKing youre just a POE genius
[2022-12-15 17:39:07] <%wolttam> Is there a even difficult MMO in existence, discounting PVP?
[2022-12-15 17:39:08] <%DOCTOR_SCURVY> you can try to play ruthless hardcore mode, but you would have to start over. and it may still be too easy for you
[2022-12-15 17:39:16] <%McTaggy> I felt like that when I played d3, It was way easy, but then you'd randomly explode into 1000 pieces
[2022-12-15 17:39:16] <%keith46256> PoE isn't difficult enough to keep him engaged to end game
[2022-12-15 17:39:21] <%+BougiePower> the stakes in those type of games are either too low, or stupid high (hardcore mode)
[2022-12-15 17:39:22] <@%$deejay4am> "I'm just trying to feel something, PoE!" barbGPW3
[2022-12-15 17:39:27] <paintbucketwastaken> that doesn't stop ppl from keep playing for 20.000 more hours

[2022-12-15 17:39:28] <%$crackawhat> @wolttam pretty sure real end game WoW is very difficult
[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <mik53afk> obviously A
[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <%Buflen> or you are over leveled
[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <%waywardfrantz> wow mythics and progression rating are difficult but most of the game until you get there is not

[2022-12-15 17:39:36] <%Yurizo007> neither. it just gets hard quite late
[2022-12-15 17:39:36] <%$bigvin81> do you understand now why people sink 1000s of hours in the game? LUL
[2022-12-15 17:39:36] <%toxicpycnometer> C  still in prologue

[2022-12-15 17:39:40] <%$sournewt> I heard somewhere you have to play 200 hours before it get hard barbToxic
[2022-12-15 17:39:41] <%+RidleyBadass> or C you got some good items that made it really easy
[2022-12-15 17:39:41] <%$Lexibee86> Mmmm, B
[2022-12-15 17:39:41] <$BlackTieBlackSuit> @tenlittlepiggies not ment to be rude or anything: blackt69GET . KEKW and play on easy. Use some of the defult races first like United humans. Focus on economy before war. You cant win if you cant fund your military. Pretend your the federation in star trek. lowkey the game is actualy a RPG with a 4x skin.
[2022-12-15 17:39:41] <%+Omiweapon> Try Diablo 3, you can increase difficulty right away
[2022-12-15 17:39:42] <%$Ziplocs> You are just really over leveled, but the leveling is pretty easy
[2022-12-15 17:39:43] <$therealJedhigh> jeenyus
[2022-12-15 17:39:43] <%$JPrimeMLG> good job genius barb7
[2022-12-15 17:39:46] <%$FengWeiWay> these games are mostly mindless left clicking
[2022-12-15 17:39:47] <%uropsalis> there are few enemies that do bad damage and some later bosses that drain your HP. But everything else just dies.
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <+doomi93> Early game is easy, it will get more difficult
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <%+chr1s1986> @RockyAce01 its easy until you have to buy stuff that allways the way f2p games work
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <EmbersColby> not your fault but you are lol
[2022-12-15 17:39:51] <%psyco_oe> You're not at endgame are you
[2022-12-15 17:39:52] <%+Lolwutkkz> @barbarousking you're also probably super over leveled because of sanctum. It should take 20 hours to get to act 10, not 3 lol
[2022-12-15 17:39:54] <%JetsTheChamp> your killing every monster
[2022-12-15 17:39:56] <%+Chicken87> Maybe the easiest game I have ever played
[2022-12-15 17:39:58] <TowlTruckGuy> well PoE has some difficulty spikes especially after act 5 you get tested way more than before barb
[2022-12-15 17:39:58] <%$Ziplocs> @psyco_oe no hes at Act 3
[2022-12-15 17:40:03] <+tdurbin24> “You have to use your hands? It’s like a baby’s toy.”
[2022-12-15 17:40:03] <%+syzlak2021> it is because you cleared every zone
[2022-12-15 17:40:03] <Teezull> @wolttam For the casual crowd, not really
[2022-12-15 17:40:03] <%Yurizo007> the grind and challenge is at endgame
[2022-12-15 17:40:06] <%+Lolwutkkz> sanctum gives a fuckload of exp
[2022-12-15 17:40:09] <%$FengWeiWay> sometimes it's addicting
[2022-12-15 17:40:09] <%$PathologicallyFresh> Most of the time people speed through levels and go to the exit ASAP and it was designed that way. It's not your fault you're overleveled
[2022-12-15 17:40:11] <%psyco_oe> @Ziplocs ohh
[2022-12-15 17:40:11] <Shiverwarp> @chr1s1986 What does this even mean, you can't buy power in PoE lol
[2022-12-15 17:40:12] <%ethanrmc> You're over-leveled and it's not your fault - act 2 sucks and is confusing so you end up killing shit for hours.
[2022-12-15 17:40:15] <%betooth> I listen to audiobooks and watch youtube while I play stuff like POE, it absolutely is too easy
[2022-12-15 17:40:17] <%Mr_Panda> you made it easy unknowingly by doing all quests, sanctum, going back and forth
[2022-12-15 17:40:24] <%toxicpycnometer> normally i reacvh act 3 around 3 hours into a new league
[2022-12-15 17:40:24] <GiantSushii> Most MMOs are a huge grind to the end game where things are a challenge
[2022-12-15 17:40:32] <Shiverwarp> Sanctum is cool
[2022-12-15 17:40:33] <RockyAce01> There is a difficulty spike at act 6
[2022-12-15 17:40:42] <theBonestorm> Even without Sanctum, if you do most of the quests you will be overleveled. Just how the game works
[2022-12-15 17:40:42] <Frysdisken> It was kind off like the developers was watching and turned the difficulty down LUL
[2022-12-15 17:40:43] <%ayyyyy_brewbacca> today feels like friday.. anybody else feel that?
[2022-12-15 17:40:46] <%+TerrdFerguson> the resolve system is the sanctum is messing with me
[2022-12-15 17:40:46] <%+tenlittlepiggies> @blacktieblacksuit thanks! I actually really like the exploration and surveying parts of the game too. Any expansions you think are worth getting?
[2022-12-15 17:40:49] <%+Fail_Snail> The sanctum is more in line with later acts
[2022-12-15 17:40:50] <%bizangles> I started a Shadow character and I think I'm bad
[2022-12-15 17:40:51] <waternap> Has POE2 come out yet?
[2022-12-15 17:40:51] <%fight_this> too easy baby game NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:40:55] <%+Mitchinator1> Am I crazy? Is there a water drop sound in this song?
[2022-12-15 17:40:55] <%Crizzle777> I agree
[2022-12-15 17:40:57] <%+chr1s1986> @Shiverwarp no even worse you can buy yourself inventory space and filters that make the game less annyoing xD.
[2022-12-15 17:40:58] <%psyco_oe> The acts in POE aren't really what the games about. Once youve gone through the acts a few times you can run through them in a few hours
[2022-12-15 17:40:58] <%+Omiweapon> feels friday
[2022-12-15 17:40:59] <Frooze_> doesnt poe have multiple difficultys like diablo?

[2022-12-15 17:41:01] <%$SetMin_> man fuck those afflictions in the sanctum LUL i went to the fountain to top off my resolve and it decreased my max resolve by a third
[2022-12-15 17:41:01] <%Mr_Panda> if you do most of the quests you will be overleveled. Just how the game works

[2022-12-15 17:41:19] <%OOOO_Sebby> the afflictions are a bit obnoxious, they'll brick your sanctum
[2022-12-15 17:41:22] <boymeetsvoid> after work on thursday counts as friday
[2022-12-15 17:41:24] <%+Beefyfife> Is the tattoo being live-streamed or off stream?
[2022-12-15 17:41:27] <advantagedmountain> Have you ever tried the one chip challange?
[2022-12-15 17:41:28] <upyu> It is because the sanctum scales with your level. The areas have a set level and you are way too high of level. you need to run through and not kill everything until your level stabilizes
[2022-12-15 17:41:28] <kirby_kingdom> hasComfy its a snow day for me

[2022-12-15 19:12:08] <%+MentallyInept> People need to remember that this stuff is made by people for free, if you don't like it... there is no loss LOL

[2022-12-15 19:12:19] <@%$DanTheVP> @FengWeiWay For me, and some others, it is mostly about motivation. Some things I make, I want them to be special and that is my motivation for making them. So I specifically don't want other people using them. If I were obligated to make them public I would just never make them at all
[2022-12-15 19:12:25] <%+young_ecologist> !flex
[2022-12-15 19:12:25] <%Rosisson> also good to note that hacks are a hobby, it's not a huge studio making a bad product

[2022-12-15 19:15:59] <%Ganongoat> Most creative level is that one that shrunk the level and rotated it
[2022-12-15 19:16:03] <%HandsomeNavigator> That level that rotated was nuts.
[2022-12-15 19:16:06] <+fearagent_> yeah that was awesome
[2022-12-15 19:16:07] <%Rosisson> especially with hacks like jump that are already a team effort, so no reason to separate the GDQ ones

[2022-12-15 23:30:05] <%Zere_Zavier> Ive almost got the victory rode the Khuzait clan to the top and betrayed them and stole most of their vassals now Ive just got to finish off their last few cities
[2022-12-15 23:32:36] <%Zere_Zavier> the improved garrison and diplomacy mods make it a lot easier just send a messager to all the clan leaders to convince them to join you and keep all your garrisons full and trained up
