[2023-01-05 04:45:53] <Jimmy_Page_> 2 mana gnolls seem balanced
[2023-01-05 04:45:58] <%+DMRhythm> Large overdoses can result in liver failure and severe acidosis, some cases patients have needed transplants if it got bad enough
[2023-01-05 04:46:10] <+goudaboi> Hey @meati i played a tempo thief rogue to legend with a lot of success. In legend the wr has calmed down a bit but the deck feels really good and a lot better than Jackpot Rogue
[2023-01-05 04:46:16] <+ruabags> Paracetamol overdoses are gruesome I hear
[2023-01-05 04:46:26] <@zridex> if you get prescribed SSRI when you don't have clinical depression and you need to fix your life, you just become content with the issues you have. at least thats my understaning
[2023-01-05 04:46:34] <+professor_flop> @DMRhythm  yeah, I read that somewhere but it is always a mystery to me. How much would you have to take?
[2023-01-05 04:46:44] <linkseff> @zridex 100%
[2023-01-05 04:46:46] <%+DMRhythm> @ruabags Its easily managable atleast, one of the few cases where we have an antidote for. But sometimes it sjust not enough

[2023-01-05 04:47:11] VIEWERS: 1 172
[2023-01-05 04:47:28] <%+DMRhythm> @professor_flop depends on the type of ingestion, acute ingestions toxic dose is roughly 200 mg/kg body weight, chronic ingestions harder to pinpoint so its trending labs and starting treatment accordingly
[2023-01-05 04:47:48] <%+DMRhythm> @ruabags Antidote is called n-acetylcysteine or NAC
[2023-01-05 04:48:05] <@zridex> NAC is great. it even helps with covid
[2023-01-05 04:48:11] <+goudaboi> Heres the URL for the tempo thief rogue https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/deckbuilder?deckcode=AAECAaIHCKH5A%2FuKBPafBNi2BNu5BMygBeigBeKkBQuq6wO9gAT3nwS6pAT7pQTspwT5rAT03QT13QSS3wTfoAUA
[2023-01-05 04:48:18] <+professor_flop> thanks, nice insight
[2023-01-05 04:48:53] <%+DMRhythm> Yea its a really safe medication overall and primarily works to glucoronidate the NAPQI into an inactive metabolite, but we just use it as a empiric liver tonic too in most cases that present w/ hepatoxicity
