[2023-01-04 19:51:50] <%qbaumi2004> oh I'm an idiot
[2023-01-04 19:51:59] <%qbaumi2004> I was looking at the 7tv v2 api the whole time
[2023-01-04 19:52:04] <%qbaumi2004> but chatterino uses 7tv v3 already
[2023-01-04 19:54:06] <@^Nightbot> Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Nemesis_lol/videos
[2023-01-04 19:55:47] <!%j0sh1g4> I can try it soon

[2023-01-04 19:56:13] <!%j0sh1g4> I would assume that the format query applies to the data on 7tv servers
[2023-01-04 19:56:31] <!%j0sh1g4> So setting it to something doesnt make any sense
[2023-01-04 19:58:06] <!%j0sh1g4> qbaumi2004
[2023-01-04 19:58:08] <!%j0sh1g4> What if
[2023-01-04 19:58:10] <!%j0sh1g4> L118
[2023-01-04 19:58:19] <!%j0sh1g4> That should do it tbh
[2023-01-04 19:58:36] <!%j0sh1g4> Remove last 4 letters and add 'gif'
[2023-01-04 19:59:31] <%qbaumi2004> no
[2023-01-04 19:59:42] <%qbaumi2004> @j0sh1g4 you wanna know why not
[2023-01-04 19:59:46] <!%j0sh1g4> Why
[2023-01-04 19:59:47] <%qbaumi2004> I'm currently investigating it
[2023-01-04 19:59:49] <%qbaumi2004> but
[2023-01-04 19:59:55] <%qbaumi2004> Image is a class they wrote
[2023-01-04 19:59:55] <!%j0sh1g4> Nake doesnt have the extension ?
[2023-01-04 20:00:08] <%qbaumi2004> this image constructor with the url just does get the image from 7tv api

[2023-01-04 20:00:30] <%qbaumi2004> Image::fromUrl gets the image data from 7tv
[2023-01-04 20:00:41] <%qbaumi2004> but if you change the last 4 digits
[2023-01-04 20:00:48] <!%j0sh1g4> It cant find it
[2023-01-04 20:00:49] <%qbaumi2004> it wont find the image because the url .gif doesnt exist
[2023-01-04 20:00:54] <!%j0sh1g4> monkaHmm
[2023-01-04 20:00:54] <!%j0sh1g4> So
[2023-01-04 20:01:06] <!%j0sh1g4> What does it do with the data then
[2023-01-04 20:01:18] <!%j0sh1g4> It makes an image

[2023-01-04 20:02:04] <%qbaumi2004> idk but it gets the file after it gets the data
[2023-01-04 20:02:10] <%qbaumi2004> it makes the link with the data

[2023-01-04 20:19:05] <%qbaumi2004> but maybe we'd have to look into when they're displayed
[2023-01-04 20:19:06] <!%j0sh1g4> Why doesnt it just save it to cache as smth and i just save it to diff name

[2023-01-04 23:24:31] <%qbaumi2004> that does mean that 7tv also serves gif versions of their emotes
[2023-01-04 23:24:37] <!%j0sh1g4> no
[2023-01-04 23:24:38] <%qbaumi2004> which is nothing we couldve known
[2023-01-04 23:24:41] <%qbaumi2004> yes
[2023-01-04 23:24:46] <!%j0sh1g4> they dont
[2023-01-04 23:24:50] <Felanbird> they do
[2023-01-04 23:24:52] <!%j0sh1g4> we just pretend the webp is a gif
[2023-01-04 23:25:04] <!%j0sh1g4> or png
[2023-01-04 23:25:15] <Felanbird> if you place the .webp on any 7tv animated emote with .gif it becomes a gif
[2023-01-04 23:25:18] <Felanbird> and u can save it as a gif
[2023-01-04 23:25:29] <Felanbird> which is why this works
[2023-01-04 23:25:57] <Felanbird> buts it not documented, I only knew about it b/c someone mentioned it to me
[2023-01-04 23:26:01] <Felanbird> thats why I set him in this direction
[2023-01-04 23:27:02] <Felanbird> or maybe we are just tricking it
