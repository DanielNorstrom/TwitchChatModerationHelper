[2022-12-24 13:31:40] <thegreypilgrimstwitch> It's not crazy. What you saying is that everyone has a right to shelter and food regardless of the success or failure of their career. Being articulate and expressing yourself in way you can be understood is critical in many fields of endeavour. Imagine a surgeon asking for a scalpel and his given a knife instead.

[2022-12-24 14:01:07] <%thegreypilgrimstwitch> Crime is a tenuous subject because it means different things to different cultures and perhaps even races. Considering that we exist in society that only allows certain institutions to create money, the shortage of money will always be artificial as it is distributed only to certain sections of society.
[2022-12-24 14:01:08] <ivailo889> and yes. I love you my love

[2022-12-24 15:11:27] <%+Valientt> how does Twitch know, do you put your gender in to your account? Been so long since I created an account
[2022-12-24 15:11:34] <slamy241> no way it's 97% back in 2018 when twitch published the metrics it was 84%
[2022-12-24 15:11:40] VIEWERS: 1¬†081
[2022-12-24 15:11:58] <%JamesAnthony92> twitch is like a modern msn who remembers MSN?

[2022-12-24 15:12:05] <%+Cwarner312> im sure if it was 50-50, men would still lead the toxicity
[2022-12-24 15:12:10] <@%$heavymetalrules> 80% sounds about right
[2022-12-24 15:12:11] <%BiscuitRaider> It's because it started off being entirely games which was male dominated to a huge extent back then, and then because of that the culture is very male, so it's not that appealing for women to be here and interact here LUL

[2022-12-24 15:12:24] <Cadaea> "In 2022, 78.36% of Twitch users are male, and 19.64% are female."
[2022-12-24 15:12:36] <+Ser_Hans> @Cadaea ah thx
[2022-12-24 15:12:38] <%BiscuitRaider> Yeah but the core community is very male and slightly incelly LUL
[2022-12-24 15:12:41] <%Daniel_EU> Oh yeah it's 78% in 2022 my 97% was from 2014
[2022-12-24 15:12:44] <%BiscuitRaider> It's not a friendly platform for women
[2022-12-24 15:12:44] <%+Valientt> that sounds more realistic

[2022-12-24 15:13:07] <+GreyHastur> but women take a lot of abuse online, some cant handle it
[2022-12-24 15:13:08] <+OathBreakerBFME> still male majority no surprise
[2022-12-24 15:13:17] <Cadaea> Gaming has only been male dominated as an interest because of how unwelcome they made it for women. I'm so glad "nerd" stuff is mainstream now
[2022-12-24 15:13:18] <bd112233> your so hot

[2022-12-24 15:13:48] <Queza2> I think twitch as a whole is kinda hostile towards woman though that doesn't help
[2022-12-24 15:13:49] <youtubethedog23> hi
[2022-12-24 15:13:53] <Mrsexbomb> 99% male 1% female

[2022-12-24 15:13:55] <%Daniel_EU> a lot of them just don't type much or at all since it can get really weird
[2022-12-24 15:13:55] <%$Warfiend81> Ive known many girls in online games and such who play male characters and such as well so they get left alone
[2022-12-24 15:13:56] <%BiscuitRaider> Cadaea yeah exactly, twitch is the same, it's historically not been welcoming to women
[2022-12-24 15:13:58] <hungrybath> i only really discovered twitch in late 2019 which was good timing with lockdowns lol
[2022-12-24 15:14:06] <%BiscuitRaider> Cadaea it is getting better though

[2022-12-24 15:14:13] <@%$heavymetalrules> it still is tbh
[2022-12-24 15:14:21] <%Anacott> Twitch hasn't released official figures about gender distribution since 2017 I believe
[2022-12-24 15:14:27] <LilLakeOcean> Let me know if I'm the only one.  so you know how u talk with your friends and family and you aren't afraid as to has u talk to them. but when u meet someone new you are like scared as to how u talk to them because u don't know how they might react when u respond LUL
[2022-12-24 15:14:27] <Cadaea> @BiscuitRaider indeed, hopefully it'll continue in the right direction
[2022-12-24 15:14:33] <+gorillabusiness_> True
[2022-12-24 15:14:35] <XBUDHAX223> Yea but its not counting lurkers and burner profiles i have a lot of homegirls that have multiple profiles like that not to mention the ability to just watch someone without being logged in

Others are preparing for their last. Regardless of the specifics remember that this season of joy is often a season of sorrow for many. Be kind, be generous, give love, give help; if nothing else, just don‚Äôt give people a hard time.

[2022-12-24 17:13:21] <!%AmontilladoWolf> I just cant imagine why you would ask someone to wait unless its for religious reasons
[2022-12-24 17:13:39] <ohbadmattylacy> if ya not having sex ..... ent you basically best mates as well in a way

[2022-12-24 18:42:37] <+Averagegatsbie> only thing i can find on him was  that he was an officer (1LT ) in the army  i cant find a job anywhere so that tells me he was probably non combat
[2022-12-24 18:42:39] <+NerdyBiker> no way they get paid that much, nobody would be having money issues
[2022-12-24 18:42:39] <%Daniel_EU> I read that TLC only pays their plane tickets but they probably get paid to create content
[2022-12-24 18:42:39] <%Heretik1985> now we know how mohamed was able to afford ditching for two weeks
