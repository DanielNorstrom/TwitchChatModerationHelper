[2023-01-03 10:08:04] <%goombaroni> i think it depends on the size of the streamer, no way smaller streamers could afford that

[2023-01-03 10:09:15] <%+ThriftyShell> I think when you're a streamer pulling like quad digits and streaming like 6 hours a day you should pay them. That's an actual job.

[2023-01-03 11:03:13] <!%RJ2theLA2> I agree makeup is to make people look different from how they ACTUALLY look.. So if you look good with makeup..
[2023-01-03 11:03:13] <kiwicoffin> that's like saying shoes are for people with bad feet

[2023-01-03 11:03:27] <%theandeemon> its a beautifying product, if smth can make u look prettier then why not just use it
[2023-01-03 11:03:30] <ABC_itsSpyro123> You can also wear makeup for fun

[2023-01-03 13:17:31] <+maxstew7> wait then how tall are you
[2023-01-03 13:17:39] <!%+ajingus> mari I promise there is no safety or personal concerns to have
[2023-01-03 13:17:42] <%ae914> you can have vtuber orgey
[2023-01-03 13:17:43] <!%+ajingus> especially with your back
[2023-01-03 13:17:44] <!%HardcorexHunter> Yeah Coqui could legally pass as a dwarf due to her height. She said she won't file for disability though because she can work and there are people who really need it.
[2023-01-03 13:17:48] <%+ChunkBeefthrust> I was surprised how many of the vtubers were hanging out IRL during it
[2023-01-03 13:17:55] <woobrmeister> sounds like a good time
[2023-01-03 13:17:59] <!thehousemasterr> why was every vtuber doing a face reveal a few months ago
[2023-01-03 13:18:00] <!%+ajingus> @ae914 marimariSLUG this has probably happened before knowing cons
[2023-01-03 13:18:01] <fabgutwich> woah! drugging people? grimmi14Bigeyes grimmi14Bigeyes grimmi14Bigeyes
[2023-01-03 13:18:01] <!JacerSaYGO> you hear a voice pass by and you start overthinking

[2023-01-03 13:18:02] <!%$RJ2theLA2> They make you wear a badge with your name or channel name but you can always FLIP IT so people cannot see!
[2023-01-03 13:18:03] <MF_Good> tbh if you do meet up then just don't tell anybody but the people you go with
[2023-01-03 13:18:04] <%BLZbubs> i'm surprised tob didn't get photographed by some loser
[2023-01-03 13:18:11] <+maxstew7> but as a vtuber nobody recognizes you
[2023-01-03 13:18:11] VIEWERS: 510
[2023-01-03 13:18:12] <!%garfield1187> definitely avoid twitchcon, go to anime cons instead or something actually good

[2023-01-03 13:19:28] <!%HardcorexHunter> She was pregnant and lost her baby from that

[2023-01-03 14:33:41] <Turrbert_> that is a requirement
[2023-01-03 14:33:41] <!%$RJ2theLA2> @ajingus they don't know how to read or HOW MAGNETS WORK

[2023-01-03 14:33:46] <+autolockon> Why‚Äôs there no voice acting in a franchise this big
[2023-01-03 14:33:51] <!%+ajingus> @RJ2theLA2 ignorance is bliss
[2023-01-03 14:33:56] <!%garfield1187> so she was getting bullied by her own members on purpose at the start?
[2023-01-03 14:34:10] <!%+ajingus> where's the part where they get arrested and executed for terrorism
[2023-01-03 14:34:19] <+Rathalosblue> Mari, pokemon is a small company. Voice acting is very expensive!
[2023-01-03 14:34:20] <!%garfield1187> if theyre gonna have this much dialogue they really should
[2023-01-03 14:34:22] <!JacerSaYGO> just maybe, doesn't have to be
[2023-01-03 14:34:25] <!%+ajingus> they need voice acting yes it will make the story impactful if they're gonna do cutscenes and big 3d models
[2023-01-03 14:34:26] <Zundrli> gamefreak suck nowadays
[2023-01-03 14:34:26] <kiwicoffin> I like that the main character has to stand here and watch this happen

[2023-01-03 14:46:47] <PAK215> Origin: It may also be an inspired caricature of a Playboy Bunny or other bunny girls as seen in popular culture. The bunny girl costumes of Playboy fame are still quite popular in Japanese adult media, which might explain Lopunny's coquettish cry and feminine figure.
