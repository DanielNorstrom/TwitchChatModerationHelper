[2022-12-18 22:39:34] <+jrwoods4> Correa is cracked.
[2022-12-18 22:39:37] <+alcabone69> Correa sucking Messi off no doubt
[2022-12-18 22:39:44] <chillippr21> passing on this game is a disaster

[2022-12-18 22:59:35] <%+xqtJack> yh
[2022-12-18 22:59:35] <uzitapuzi> @Phopper yes
[2022-12-18 22:59:37] <+campersnoop> I think lots of the casuals left the game nep that is why
[2022-12-18 22:59:52] <ys_iam_leeds_fan> not long started fut but is there a much of a difference to having my team on 31 chemistry to 33 chemistry?
[2022-12-18 22:59:56] <+King_rfz14> Elo maybe
[2022-12-18 23:00:00] <%$ItsTr3ple> Casuals don't play champs @campersnoop
[2022-12-18 23:00:02] <%CeltHD> Hopefully casuals come back to the game over the christmas, seems like only hardcores are playing it right now

[2022-12-18 23:00:41] <%+aniron123> @chillippr21 yep
[2022-12-18 23:00:48] <ys_iam_leeds_fan> I've managed to have di Maria on one star it shouldn't affect him to much @aniron123
[2022-12-18 23:00:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> This may sound mad, but do you think it could be how good your internet is? Surely youll only match against others with insane internet who most likely take gaming in general seriously?
[2022-12-18 23:01:02] <%$ItsTr3ple> Lovely touch

[2022-12-18 23:11:09] <%CeltHD> Crazy thing is Correa wont get into alot of peoples teams, unless they actively downgrade. Most people have crazy heroes or icons now.

[2022-12-18 23:12:25] <stemil19> one more goal and he is off
[2022-12-18 23:12:40] <uncommittedgamer> Honestly, Ribéry and di Maria aren’t far off each other and they’re locked to the left side.. can’t believe either can’t switch side :/
[2022-12-18 23:12:46] <%$wantsomechickenlad22> @celthd people complain about having a lot of op players but don’t think that they can have fun with it

[2022-12-18 23:15:29] <uncommittedgamer> Honestly Messi and cr7 should ride off into sunset. Unfortunately one is riding off a hero and one long enough to become the villain

[2022-12-18 23:17:01] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Cause both the Winter Wildcard clip and Di Maria clip didnt go up before the main channel vid. Can do WInter Wildcard starting tomorrow as a clip and hold Benz off for tomorrow?

[2022-12-18 23:17:05] <%AHumanAlien> Messi wouldn't have been a worse player if Argentina lost on pens today
[2022-12-18 23:17:05] <%+aniron123> and to be fair Portugal has the better player on average
[2022-12-18 23:17:05] <+sealdawg> Messi was clear before Ronaldo before World Cup

[2022-12-18 23:17:16] <%leonm1997> Are u serious?
[2022-12-18 23:17:17] <BraylonSnow> Not if just portugal won it. Ronaldo would have needed to have a tourny like Messi did

[2022-12-18 23:17:29] <harrypicko97> Worked a treat
[2022-12-18 23:17:29] <%$lfcplz> excited to use this Di Maria
[2022-12-18 23:17:31] <+garold86> the fact that argentinas players did everything to help Messi win yet Portugal players werent that fussed says it all
[2022-12-18 23:17:33] <uncommittedgamer> sucks this World Cup got this great finale, when overall it was filled with scandals and problems.
[2022-12-18 23:17:34] <$punyay> I think that di Maria is great value
[2022-12-18 23:17:45] <%theJFKexperience0> Yeah my b I meant do you think he worth it now😂
[2022-12-18 23:17:48] <%$wantsomechickenlad22> If Ronaldo goes back to madrid and somehow win the ucl he’s still up there

[2022-12-18 23:17:55] <+philipio1> The final was perfect. Messi confirmed GOAT but mbappe also coming out as a star
[2022-12-18 23:18:00] <%theJFKexperience0> I wanna do him but 500k is so much fodder
[2022-12-18 23:18:01] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Well the ASM clip went up at like 1am so technically that went up too
[2022-12-18 23:18:04] <defter40ru> @brunottigg thats qualification bud
[2022-12-18 23:18:04] <$Eoinft> Ronaldo can still be considered the goat is just Messi has accomplished more then CR7
[2022-12-18 23:18:06] <cheekymang0s> You think this World Cup gets messi his 8th Ballon d’Or nep?
[2022-12-18 23:18:06] <%+Fvley> would you say Correa wa worth the 200k?

[2022-12-18 23:18:45] <lewismason1819> In terms of footballing ability I always felt Messi was the Goat but overall career achievements and stats made it a debate with CR7 but now adding a World Cup at 35 it’s just takes Messi to that next level imo and cements him as the undisputed Goat
[2022-12-18 23:18:47] <uncommittedgamer> @eoinft well, winning the EU is pretty good. Considering there’s just as many great nations as current wc..

[2022-12-18 23:20:35] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The WC makes Messi undisputed all time for me. Maradonna and Pele always had that over him. They don't anymore and it elevates him above CR7 now on several fronts. Absolutely mental that we had them both at the same time.
[2022-12-18 23:20:39] <%$wantsomechickenlad22> @92ish562 still don’t dismiss how good argentina were

[2022-12-18 23:52:28] <%+Fvley> Di Maria is so good for the price, the WF upgrade is insane
[2022-12-18 23:52:44] <f1playsfifa> how long left for champs?
[2022-12-18 23:52:49] <%AHumanAlien> @km411996  Well, zero chance of that, they'll probably more expensive and less reasonable. Especially if they have a likely name change
[2022-12-18 23:52:52] <+Ctime1233211> I like that you play Christmas music not many streamers doing it for some reason
