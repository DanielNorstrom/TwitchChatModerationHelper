[2023-01-04 09:15:44] <%Zeroslayer> Madge TeaTime True
[2023-01-04 09:15:55] <%Zeroslayer> MMO January COPIUM
[2023-01-04 09:15:58] <%Criptonix100> He said 2 days of farming on WoW Madge
[2023-01-04 09:16:28] <%Medias> Now it will be a whole Month PepeLaugh
[2023-01-04 09:16:38] <%Criptonix100> whatever...I'm getting used to MHW for now KEKW
[2023-01-04 09:17:02] <%Criptonix100> switched to Charge Blade
[2023-01-04 09:17:07] <%Medias> Took me many hours getting into MHW
[2023-01-04 09:17:27] <%Medias> The older games have such bad gameplay I can't get into it
[2023-01-04 09:17:30] <%+buffalohandler> MHW?
[2023-01-04 09:17:38] <%+buffalohandler> monster hunter world?
[2023-01-04 09:17:38] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah monster hunter isn't the easiest kind of game to get into. But once you're hooked you're gone KEKL
[2023-01-04 09:17:38] <%Criptonix100> I'm almost at High Rank quests Defender Armor too op
[2023-01-04 09:17:39] <%Medias> Monster Hunter World
[2023-01-04 09:17:41] <%Zeroslayer> Yes
[2023-01-04 09:18:40] <%Criptonix100> should I use Vitality mantle or the HP Booster?
[2023-01-04 09:19:00] <%Zeroslayer> Can't go wrong with HP booster.
[2023-01-04 09:19:07] <%Medias> Yea
[2023-01-04 09:19:08] <%Zeroslayer> If I remember correctly.
[2023-01-04 09:19:32] <%Zeroslayer> Later you'll be able to equip two at once I believe?
[2023-01-04 09:19:55] <%Criptonix100> for now idk but I can use 1 of them
[2023-01-04 09:19:56] <%Medias> I believe so

[2023-01-04 09:24:19] <%Criptonix100> what are your predictions on what class he will play on GW2?
[2023-01-04 09:24:30] <%Zeroslayer> Woyer SMOrc
[2023-01-04 09:24:34] <%Criptonix100> I bet either Warrior or Necro
[2023-01-04 09:24:42] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah
[2023-01-04 09:24:57] <%Medias> I don't like Warrior in gw2
[2023-01-04 09:25:04] <%Criptonix100> let him be the banner slave KEKW
[2023-01-04 09:25:04] <%Zeroslayer> I'll probably make a thief cus all the elite specs look pretty interesting.
[2023-01-04 09:25:36] <%Thelete> as a thief main, they are pretty good
[2023-01-04 09:25:47] <%Thelete> cant say too much about the new one tho
[2023-01-04 09:26:00] <%Zeroslayer> Firebrand is w/e don't care about the nerfs as I liked willbender more but dragon hunter or w/e it's called seemed kinda meh.
[2023-01-04 09:26:09] <%Thelete> just finished EoD campaign and then stopped playing because no new raids
[2023-01-04 09:26:34] <%Zeroslayer> I got burned out before finishing EoD KEKL
[2023-01-04 09:26:48] <%Medias> EoD?
[2023-01-04 09:26:49] <%Thelete> ye but you werent caught up were you :P
[2023-01-04 09:26:52] <%Criptonix100> lmao EoD sure doesn't look like a good expansion for GW2
[2023-01-04 09:26:54] <%Thelete> end of dragons
[2023-01-04 09:26:56] <%Criptonix100> that's why I didn't buy it
[2023-01-04 09:27:09] <%Medias> I only played the retail version of GW2 Sadge
[2023-01-04 09:27:19] <%Zeroslayer> Path of Fire has been the best (from a casual perspective)
[2023-01-04 09:27:33] <%Thelete> i was just really looking forward to new raids and then there were no new raids so i was Sadge
[2023-01-04 09:27:41] <%Criptonix100> not many good elite specs, story is kinda meh....
[2023-01-04 09:27:53] <%Wodiin> Hey Chat!
[2023-01-04 09:27:56] <%Criptonix100> Path of Fire had the best story and elite specs

[2023-01-04 09:28:34] <%Zeroslayer> They are cool in theory.
[2023-01-04 09:28:57] <%Medias> He would forget it immediately PepeLaugh
[2023-01-04 09:29:45] <%Criptonix100> should we help him walk through the deep Tangled Depths map? PepeLaugh

[2023-01-04 10:11:51] <Cimexis> 2nd boss can be dangerous for DPS on Tyra. DoT during soul steal has a habit of catching them off-guard.

[2023-01-04 10:27:19] <+TrashCanRaider> @jamesg1928 2 people get positive, 2 people get negative, and there's a fifth that's not important. You got 15 seconds to go touch a positive to a negative or you get stunned. But you want to wait to clear it till as long as possible cause while you have it you get a dmg and healing buff
[2023-01-04 10:27:22] <%+Spira> +20 today? hype!
[2023-01-04 10:27:26] <Jay_Overdosed> and remember out side of twitch you ever have a problem i wil glady set aside time to make sure you have some ont to talk to
[2023-01-04 10:27:31] <%skematic1> @jamesg1928 you get a 30% damage buff while you have it, avoid the swirlies when its cast, 3 people get positive or negative the other 2 get positive or negative, clear them with the opposite of the one you get, one person gets to keep the buff, the last person keeps it for the duration. if you dont clear it you get stunned.

[2023-01-04 13:04:09] <+larllen> @MediArgentumTF Dungeons are more and more design towards MDI, so each pack has 10-20 abbilities and required kick rotations. Also stuff does way more dmg and healers do not do as much dps as in SL. Everything is much harder (outside of old dungeons)
