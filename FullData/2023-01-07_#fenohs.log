[2023-01-07 15:56:54] <PrinceTheonatrius> or maybe they rotate rogue cards to wild and give the class the priest treatment with carbaggio cards KEK
[2023-01-07 15:56:55] <%chrisvel89> buff the ashbringer

[2023-01-07 15:58:43] <PrinceTheonatrius> it works in wild
[2023-01-07 15:58:44] <babyyshaark_> 3 mana bloodlust ends it
[2023-01-07 15:58:49] <%deezubernuts> no just make it 4 corpses
[2023-01-07 15:58:53] <dhevos666> does 3unholy even have card draw?
[2023-01-07 15:59:00] <%NakataDaskalov> even dk
[2023-01-07 15:59:08] <!%nburst1> it doesn‚Äôt get on the board fast enough, and when it finally does the board doesn‚Äôt matter as much
[2023-01-07 15:59:12] <%deezubernuts> like 3 mana wont matter as much as 4 corpses imo
[2023-01-07 15:59:30] <raven__94> @FenoHS 2 mana + 2 attack
[2023-01-07 15:59:33] <!%nburst1> it just needs faster early game
[2023-01-07 15:59:38] <gosamigo> unholy stacks corpses more than Blood & frost

[2023-01-07 16:00:17] <!%nburst1> u never discover it
[2023-01-07 16:00:17] <EloGiggIe> it should draw a card in base

[2023-01-07 16:00:22] <redk1ller93> i think gain 3 corpses and draw a card is better?
[2023-01-07 16:00:27] <beatforfun21> All this cards are gonna be aggro and the games are gonna end with snap 6 again

[2023-01-07 16:00:54] <PrinceTheonatrius> it's only good if you discover it with school teacher and you play 3 blood so you need the corpses for vampiric blood
[2023-01-07 16:00:59] <+droqqa> a 1 mana card that gives you +4 corpses seems like it should be good so long as you have a solid payoff

[2023-01-07 18:23:43] <@%dogdog> I played like 1 day it was alright
[2023-01-07 18:23:47] <@%dogdog> i think i 'liked last expansion more
[2023-01-07 18:23:59] <@%dogdog> kinda felt shitty to lose to armor druid
[2023-01-07 18:24:14] <%cocaeye> these cards from march of lick king will rotate out at the end ?
[2023-01-07 18:24:16] <cabstero> druid is a dead class now
[2023-01-07 18:24:20] <@%dogdog> yeah, i mean they have no cheats or cool combos
[2023-01-07 18:24:26] <%neonforce123> DK might be the nuts after rotation when everything sucks @FenoHS
[2023-01-07 18:24:26] <@%dogdog> just strong independent cards
[2023-01-07 18:24:29] <%iTvngo> New class this expansion and it didn‚Äôt really feel like it smh. Should have waited until rotation to bring in DK smh
[2023-01-07 18:24:30] <@%dogdog> but that's not enough
[2023-01-07 18:24:33] <thatdotaplayer> they killed druid Sadge

[2023-01-07 18:25:30] <!tsogl> coincidentally every time druid is dead the meta is just bad to play in. Druid probably opposite of priest which is a disease for the meta when its good or something idk
[2023-01-07 18:25:48] <+cinnamonchair> what even was the rogue nerf again>
[2023-01-07 18:25:49] <Dowsha_tv> @FenoHS  So instead of nerfing ROgue mroe they could support controll more?
