[2023-01-04 16:21:43] <BrkasMaras> People calling this Pred lobby? Where are Preds exept these guys?
[2023-01-04 16:21:51] <strugglebusses> the skill gap between top tier preds and high diamonds/low masters is higher than those same diamonds/masters and bronzes
[2023-01-04 16:21:57] <takeshimontoya> @pdb221 Yes please tell the #4 pred how to play KEKW
[2023-01-04 16:21:57] <TsukiSayu> now these are preds obviously
[2023-01-04 16:21:57] <+alucard8732> @brkasmaras bro you're downing yourself before you even fight. preds are subject to the same RNG as you. I've watched Rogue just get ripped sometimes for hours losing RP to masters and dias because they caught the shit end of the RNG stick
[2023-01-04 16:21:58] <Ciliegia2119> @brkasmaras I would take my chances, if I die all well man I move on to the next match and try again, think what I can do better. Be open minded dude. Sounds like you‚Äôre just not meant for ranked
[2023-01-04 16:21:59] <VLuigii> @timidsquirrel24 Aint his fault though. This game is so bad with matchmaking. They cater to higher ranks
[2023-01-04 16:22:00] <+timidsquirrel24> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying @brkasmaras
[2023-01-04 16:22:00] <+khornettv> I mean, what would the alternative, to have 20 minute queue times? While I agree that Plat should not be in their games, D1/D2 is fair game

[2023-01-04 16:26:07] <+khornettv> @VLuigii that's pretty much the current system, wtf is wrong with you? Most Plats you see are teamed with Dia 1/2, that's not the fault of Respawn or Ea or anyone but the Plats own. In extremly low populated servers, it can happen that Plat gets into Pred Lobbies (or vice versa) but then again, what should Respawn do? Give 3h queue to people on low populated servers? Close the server and bring high ping abusers to the other servers?
[2023-01-04 16:26:10] <myrio__> specific or fundamental routines? @HisWattson

[2023-01-04 17:06:00] <+khornettv> I mean, either a) your anti cheat acts like a solid anti virus program and every interaction with the GPU and game files is checked and you get automatically banned if something is interacting that shouldn't (could lead to alot false positives) or b) Games will run in an encrypted sandbox with a valorant like watcher running outside and checking for things that want to interact with the sandbox or the GPU
[2023-01-04 17:06:03] <jelpymax> developing cheat's isn't a bad thing givinig them away or selling them is a bad thing

[2023-01-04 17:24:19] <hrnyjlwrdn> You're right Mcdonalds do require investors to open them in very specific places. Its because mcdonalds owns the land they build on, so theyre more of a property company then they are a resturant
[2023-01-04 17:24:19] <@%$turtleTiff> @Tylerxox3 apparently america is the only place with like 2 or 3 mcdonalds location per city
