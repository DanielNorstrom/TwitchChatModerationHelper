The time of the day turns into what stores are open for intertainment or food

[2023-01-08 12:30:56] <serenityfey> it's good to max 2nd nuke for the CD but 1st is more mana and save CD @singsing
[2023-01-08 12:30:58] <%Ditow> NOTED
[2023-01-08 12:30:59] <%kazundetec> W is yes, but Q is a no
[2023-01-08 12:31:00] <paraoverlord69> q tho
[2023-01-08 12:31:00] <gbg1000> lvl 1 slave
[2023-01-08 12:31:00] <Zangetsu_4> have to follow Arteezy BatChest

[2023-01-08 12:31:02] <%sinister_ramen> hatduck_ Sadeg
[2023-01-08 12:31:03] <%iamanoob> yeah its very debatable imo you dont get that much stats for not leveling it
[2023-01-08 12:31:03] <%darkknighticus> @sinister_ramen NOOOO
[2023-01-08 12:31:03] <Geweldigheid> i think max stun but keep q at 1
[2023-01-08 12:31:03] <%+yonathankevin> 3Head
[2023-01-08 12:31:04] <%Garadoxus> q mana

[2023-01-08 12:31:07] <wematinw> spell 1 use mire mana
[2023-01-08 12:31:07] <rudisang> 3Head Oi
[2023-01-08 12:31:08] <!%kmzia> 3Head
[2023-01-08 12:31:09] <%Desp3ro> from 13s to 7s much more usable
[2023-01-08 12:31:10] <RishabhRC> just keep q 1
[2023-01-08 12:31:13] <%exdeathzzzz> max stun is fine i think, but Q increase by 45mana cost
[2023-01-08 12:31:13] <Geweldigheid> but u need to buy maelstrom if u dont amx dragon slave
[2023-01-08 12:31:15] <fabiwanius> Q 1
[2023-01-08 12:31:16] <%kazundetec> W scaling with stun duration and cd, but for Q is NAAAH
[2023-01-08 12:31:18] <Rafayao> more stat more mana more tank?
[2023-01-08 12:31:18] <%miloenjoyer_> nuke deezNutzzz
[2023-01-08 12:31:22] <TheOnin> Not maxing stun is stupid. Not maxing nuke is a choice.
[2023-01-08 12:31:23] <HensTobs11> extra 35 mana per slave
[2023-01-08 12:31:24] <P4InLeader> even rtz said not maxing q W after ur passiv ofc is bad
[2023-01-08 12:31:24] <KianaTheValkyria> Q 1 W fine
[2023-01-08 12:31:27] <LinksJr> cd is on talent right?
[2023-01-08 12:31:28] <pochi1103> magic damage lina when?
[2023-01-08 12:31:29] <%spinchter66771> isnt it 1 q max e then max w?
[2023-01-08 12:31:29] <fishfishfishfishes> ohfuck
[2023-01-08 12:31:30] <%lofn7> 3Head
[2023-01-08 12:31:30] <%$yumeko__> maybe going no stats is better for mid Lina
[2023-01-08 12:31:31] <!BenjyyX> THey don't max Q not W as far as i know. Because it's pretty useless to max Q compared to stats
[2023-01-08 12:31:32] <%ZuraNotZura> Yeah sumail also said that Lina is always a wave clearing hero so maxing nukes should always be the way

[2023-01-08 13:55:42] <morcock> Ouker, also known as Agent O is one of our premier agents. He is really expensive, so most of the time our customers cant afford his services. When he isn't carrying games with his Arc Warden, Pango or Rubick he is in Zen mode playing Jump King for fun. Unfortunately, what makes him lethal in-game makes him even deadlier when he is activated. You get complacent thinking he is gonna carry as usual; and then suddenly you realise you are playing against a Finn stack and its already over. BOG

[2023-01-08 14:10:40] <morcock> Ouker, also known as Agent O is one of our premier agents. He is really expensive, so most of the time our customers cant afford his services. When he isn't carrying games with his Arc Warden, Pango or Rubick he is in Zen mode playing Jump King for fun. Unfortunately, what makes him lethal in-game makes him even deadlier when he is activated. You get complacent thinking he is gonna carry as usual; and then suddenly you realise you are playing against a Finn stack and its already over. BOGGED

[2023-01-08 23:49:06] <!%yelnaX> tbh it's a very similar situation to baby metal's
[2023-01-08 23:49:19] <!%yelnaX> the label was looking for young girls to sing in the band they were producing
[2023-01-08 23:49:28] <!%yelnaX> so they casted them
[2023-01-08 23:49:53] <%$inoe182> basically
[2023-01-08 23:50:03] <%$inoe182> but that 3 girls from babymetal already worked as idol
