[2023-01-03 01:29:07] <buttsitter> The crystal beam goes crazy
[2023-01-03 01:29:08] <%+Teacher_Tim> Snow burst so good on cast builds
[2023-01-03 01:29:19] <+EldritchPreacher> Don’t let him lie to you. He hasn’t won once. He’s just in denial LUL
[2023-01-03 01:29:19] <Flipnip_Slipgrip> 3 is a prophecy and it's epic so you can sell it for big bucks
[2023-01-03 01:29:25] <buttsitter> Idk what your other boons are though
[2023-01-03 01:29:43] <$ryukosho> snow burst is fun though

[2023-01-03 01:30:02] <Flipnip_Slipgrip> Honestly crystal beam is probably the worst cast ability in the game.
[2023-01-03 01:30:02] <Marshmallum> does crystal beam still give you the mirror bonus for +50% dmg?
[2023-01-03 01:30:17] <%keeran8894> you can turn boons into other boons
[2023-01-03 01:30:21] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> ohhh
[2023-01-03 01:30:23] <%+psykoskream> that could be, don't know for sure
[2023-01-03 01:30:37] <buttsitter> If you build right for it crystal beam is probably the best
[2023-01-03 01:30:57] <$ryukosho> i like zeus thunder burst but beam is really good
[2023-01-03 01:30:59] <%keeran8894> crystal beam is OP but kinda frustrating to watch as it SLOWLY moves to it;'s target LUL
[2023-01-03 01:31:00] <%+Teacher_Tim> Nah, Poseidon best
[2023-01-03 01:31:05] <Marshmallum> I don't like it personally but it's pretty good
[2023-01-03 01:31:10] <Flipnip_Slipgrip> Well what do I know... I've only beaten Hades on 32 heat with every weapon :)
[2023-01-03 01:31:11] <%+Teacher_Tim> Followed by aphro Hera cast
[2023-01-03 01:31:16] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> crystal beam aka "let me solo him"
[2023-01-03 01:31:23] <%keeran8894> @Oroboro you can use fated authority to turn boons into other boons.
[2023-01-03 01:31:54] <chiyo721> Beams are great at building up calls at least

[2023-01-03 01:34:58] <Marshmallum> the damage seems okay it's just fists naturally put you in a lot of danger so will lose a lot of health

[2023-01-03 01:37:00] <Marshmallum> no depending on the aspect hammers are meh
[2023-01-03 01:37:10] <Flipnip_Slipgrip> helf
[2023-01-03 01:37:20] <%SteveSketches> Later on some duos are worth getting over hammers.  But part of the fun is developing your own preferences and styles.
[2023-01-03 01:37:22] <%+N7_Indra> Yeah some aspects dont get crazy benefits from hammers

[2023-01-03 02:09:37] <Laurcus> So Oro, now that you're a certified Papa Hades farmer, would it be okay if I mentioned a cool strat for him that you're unlikely to uncover on your own? If you say no I won't bring it up again lol.

[2023-01-03 03:39:43] <mambamantv> Zeus Attack + Aspect of Ares is the weapon of choice for speed runners
[2023-01-03 03:39:44] <%keeran8894> the ONLY thing i don't like about Eris aspect is the fact that it doesn;t synergize with the weapon buff for 300% dmg because it also hurts you, Sadge i love that build

[2023-01-03 03:40:50] <+siscoross> zeus works great with jolted + fire support is good on the gun
[2023-01-03 03:41:02] <WyvernLink> gun takes a bit to get used to in this, but can be very powerful
[2023-01-03 03:41:04] <+TheAssumingMage> feeeesh
[2023-01-03 03:41:07] <SabreClass> nice
[2023-01-03 03:41:12] <+siscoross> definitely want the hammer upgrade for faster atk speed
[2023-01-03 03:41:17] <%Pogarithmic> Dodge strikes do work with gun btw. increases fire rate of the first few shots

[2023-01-03 03:41:31] <%nola_epeeist> Zeus attack, Pos dash, arty special is the go to. But that requires lots of keepsake swapping.
[2023-01-03 03:41:36] <%l_shadow177> might get ares next and then merciful end duo but depends how rng is gonna be
[2023-01-03 03:41:42] <+siscoross> I did my gun run with 425 hp LUL so had a good roll
[2023-01-03 03:41:46] <Neaan> For the gun I found rebinding reload to another button to be really helpful.
[2023-01-03 03:41:46] <%nola_epeeist> can worry about that stuff once you want to get the heat up
[2023-01-03 03:42:03] <XerraVolos> G'devenin luluffHey

[2023-01-03 04:28:36] <RickyRelucent> always*
[2023-01-03 04:28:36] <+siscoross> your cast weakens and then it lets your doom do continuous damage
[2023-01-03 04:28:36] <WyvernLink> cast is your only weak
[2023-01-03 04:28:41] <%nola_epeeist> the duo requires weak. Cast only way to get weak
[2023-01-03 04:28:44] <+TheAssumingMage> So cast first and then murder

[2023-01-03 04:31:20] <%nola_epeeist> @Marshmallum Yeah. It's 4 specific boons in only 2 possible configurations. And you need poms and secondaries for the damage to be good. Probably the hardest duo to pull off.

[2023-01-03 04:49:01] <MrPeer> broker might have a good deal for keys
[2023-01-03 04:49:01] <!%Ebonslayer> It takes a god with training by one of the greatest mortal warriors, legendary weapons, blessings by the entire pantheon and some weird super diety to escape half the time. Honestly, it sounds like Hades is just trying to be nice.

[2023-01-03 04:50:06] <LilFoxPaws> yeah God's legacy is more fun
[2023-01-03 04:50:12] <%$Illuna_Meira> goes to 10 percent
[2023-01-03 04:50:17] <+TheAssumingMage> @Oroboro legendary boons are unique and have requirements
[2023-01-03 04:50:20] <%OptPlaysGames> I love gods legacy because I like forcing duo builds
[2023-01-03 04:50:21] <%nola_epeeist> If you don't want duos, then the other is way better b/c Epic is always helpful
[2023-01-03 04:50:22] <Aruvella> God's Legacy is better
[2023-01-03 04:50:24] <zxthed> Pride is 20
[2023-01-03 04:50:27] <+siscoross> epic goes muuuuch higher
[2023-01-03 04:50:31] <+siscoross> 20 iirc
[2023-01-03 04:50:32] <%nola_epeeist> And sometimes you don't want duos in the way
[2023-01-03 04:50:43] <LilFoxPaws> duo boons makes builds more funs
[2023-01-03 04:50:44] <RickyRelucent> 20+ it can be heroic
[2023-01-03 04:50:47] <%$Illuna_Meira> 10 for duo or legend beats epic I believe but it depends on person

[2023-01-03 04:54:44] <RickyRelucent> i like shops, always tons of boons
[2023-01-03 04:54:45] <%nola_epeeist> It gets obnoxious with the people who don't show up consistently like Meg or Patty
[2023-01-03 04:54:45] <%$Illuna_Meira> erebus gates will need heat beginning from 5
[2023-01-03 04:54:46] <LilFoxPaws> they are ok, not super amazing
[2023-01-03 04:54:54] <RickyRelucent> money isn't the easiest thing to get tho

[2023-01-03 05:05:55] <%nola_epeeist> You have to swap to the other cast type in your mirror

[2023-01-03 05:05:58] <RedBoss11> @lilfoxpaws does it work? because the feather and Than's keepsake only count the last chamber of each tunnel
[2023-01-03 05:05:58] <%OptPlaysGames> You also need to switch back to “3 casts you pick up” rather than “1 cast that recharges”
[2023-01-03 05:06:01] <MrPeer> not having stygian soul would help
[2023-01-03 05:06:11] <%SteveSketches> Either all in on Exit Wounds or all in on a different cast.

[2023-01-03 05:14:02] <MetaYoutou> 2 is better
[2023-01-03 05:14:02] <%nola_epeeist> shot does most damage as a cast
[2023-01-03 05:14:02] <Pillagius> double the damage and it's safer

[2023-01-03 06:20:38] <%nola_epeeist> sounds about right. That and the shield he doesn't have yet are both really good for that
[2023-01-03 06:20:40] <%Evil_on_Paper> Knock knock!
[2023-01-03 06:20:46] <MrPeer> god damn thats a build

[2023-01-03 06:21:31] <%nola_epeeist> @SteveSketches It took me a while to get good using that weapon, but it's a lot of fun.
[2023-01-03 06:21:32] <+nazzul64> love watching it

[2023-01-03 06:21:44] <@%Pallydan9K> Am also big slep
[2023-01-03 06:21:45] <%OptPlaysGames> This is a great game to have in your repertoire
[2023-01-03 06:21:46] <+TheAssumingMage> Making me want to go back, and I have hundreds of hours
[2023-01-03 06:21:47] <%KroFoSho> Yeah, loving it!
[2023-01-03 06:21:52] <MrPeer> thats what I love about this game when the heat is mot cranked too high you can really experiment with anything
[2023-01-03 06:22:01] <%hokmon_> glad to watch you playing it, you really seem to be having a lot of fun with it, it's fun to watch you enjoy a game I like this much
[2023-01-03 06:22:02] <HigBig> I love Hades, so addicting. Literally every run makes you feel like you progress a lot
[2023-01-03 06:22:30] <HigBig> For sure one of the better rogue-likes in history I dare to say
[2023-01-03 06:22:32] <%+direwolfnotinbed> he's scared of 8 LUL
[2023-01-03 06:22:33] <%hokmon_> 8 is spicy, can't say I've ever gone that far in
[2023-01-03 06:22:33] <!%$Mohl97> it's something other than elden ring so I'm always down
[2023-01-03 06:22:33] <!%xperimentalsubject> Oh, I don't think I ever noticed those things in the corner lol
[2023-01-03 06:22:44] <!%$Mohl97> got that invasion prep fatigue NODDERS
[2023-01-03 06:22:52] <HigBig> lets go PogU
[2023-01-03 06:22:52] <@%Pallydan9K> bowbowbow run
[2023-01-03 06:22:53] <TheEnygma> nearly 200 hours and I never noticed those
[2023-01-03 06:22:55] <%hokmon_> bow is fun, hera bow especially
[2023-01-03 06:22:55] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> I havent unlocked the last one yet
[2023-01-03 06:22:58] <%$LeonidasTDD> Hera is my favorite bow
[2023-01-03 06:23:00] <!%xperimentalsubject> Chiron da Bes
[2023-01-03 06:23:00] <morsecodec> Nice!
[2023-01-03 06:23:06] <%nola_epeeist> aphro cast
[2023-01-03 06:23:06] <SabreClass> hera is interesting loading casts
[2023-01-03 06:23:06] <%OptPlaysGames> Exit wounds take 2?
[2023-01-03 06:23:06] <TheEnygma> Art cast
[2023-01-03 06:23:09] <%SteveSketches> Aphro or Dio cast.
[2023-01-03 06:23:12] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Hera has nasty burst dmg
[2023-01-03 06:23:15] <%hokmon_> I like dio
[2023-01-03 06:23:15] <morsecodec> Hera and Aphro
[2023-01-03 06:23:21] <Heart_Eyez> dio cast is fun
[2023-01-03 06:23:21] <+TheAssumingMage> dio cast is good
[2023-01-03 06:23:23] <%SlamDunkinson> dio is good but u need stygian
[2023-01-03 06:23:24] <%$LeonidasTDD> Dio or Aphro, since those are the highest dmaage wise

[2023-01-03 06:23:54] <mfsolomon> multi
[2023-01-03 06:23:57] <%hokmon_> gives you good burst
[2023-01-03 06:23:58] <%$LeonidasTDD> Multiple, you can load all three into a shot
[2023-01-03 06:24:01] <%SteveSketches> You can stack them all at once.
[2023-01-03 06:24:06] <%SteveSketches> It's INSANE
[2023-01-03 06:24:10] <WyvernLink> multi, you want to stack all of them in at once
[2023-01-03 06:24:11] <%SteveSketches> YES
[2023-01-03 06:24:14] <mfsolomon> bro it MELTS
[2023-01-03 06:24:18] <%OptPlaysGames> I think multi is always better honestly, not sure what recharge is best for
[2023-01-03 06:24:19] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Try it right now lol
[2023-01-03 06:24:20] <+SoullesGaming> multiple but dont skip on hermes for faster returns
[2023-01-03 06:24:21] <%hokmon_> deletes trash mobs
[2023-01-03 06:24:23] <%hokmon_> the issue is bosses
[2023-01-03 06:24:24] <TheEnygma> just max out one of them
[2023-01-03 06:24:24] <%SteveSketches> I just killed Hades in record time with Hera
[2023-01-03 06:24:25] <+TheAssumingMage> Thats more boon specific. Regen for persisting casts like dio and deme
[2023-01-03 06:24:31] <SabreClass> Dio/Zeus has interesting synergy with fog cloud lightning bolts
[2023-01-03 06:24:45] <%Nirouku01> 2023 already starting its crap.
[2023-01-03 06:24:51] <%$Illuna_Meira> I feel like this is gonna be like the last unlucky run
[2023-01-03 06:24:55] <MrPeer> oh shit Oro going to do Hera run
[2023-01-03 06:24:56] <%hokmon_> @SabreClass I absolutely love this combo, it's what carried my second win
[2023-01-03 06:25:02] <Heart_Eyez> yeah the dio/zeus duo is great
[2023-01-03 06:25:08] <%nola_epeeist> dio better with other cast weapons. Hera sings with aphro (and pos secondarily)
[2023-01-03 06:25:11] <+SoullesGaming> festive fog
[2023-01-03 06:25:14] <%hokmon_> yeah
[2023-01-03 06:25:17] <+hinarf> he holy dives
[2023-01-03 06:25:21] <%$LeonidasTDD> Super high damage with no windup anymore like it normally would
[2023-01-03 06:25:30] <%nola_epeeist> dio doesn't benefit from the bow's faster drop time
[2023-01-03 06:25:31] <%SteveSketches> With Dio you want to get Zeus on Special or Dash to get Scintillating Feast.
[2023-01-03 06:25:37] <%$Illuna_Meira> there's also duos with festive fog they're cool
[2023-01-03 06:25:38] VIEWERS: 571
[2023-01-03 06:25:38] <%hokmon_> just delivers the fog straight to the target
[2023-01-03 06:25:39] <+hinarf> hes been down so long you can barely see
[2023-01-03 06:25:41] <WyvernLink> it just puts the cast where the arrow hits
[2023-01-03 06:25:45] <%hokmon_> instead of the little mortar effect
[2023-01-03 06:25:47] <%SlamDunkinson> u gotta wait for the fog to clear before u can pick it up again tho
[2023-01-03 06:25:49] <Ibadss> isnt aphrodite the onw with the auto comeback cast skill?
[2023-01-03 06:25:55] <+TheAssumingMage> @Oroboro if you go dio exit wounds becomes useless
[2023-01-03 06:25:55] <%nola_epeeist> festive fog v fun. But bow not ideal
[2023-01-03 06:26:01] <+SoullesGaming> zeus or demeter both work well
[2023-01-03 06:26:09] <%$Illuna_Meira> ^ I prefer demeter
[2023-01-03 06:26:13] <%hokmon_> bow is fun, but you definitely want that hermes perk to give you stuff back
[2023-01-03 06:26:21] <%SteveSketches> With Aphro you want Athena and Artemis.
[2023-01-03 06:26:25] <%hokmon_> I think?
[2023-01-03 06:26:27] <%SteveSketches> With Dio you want Zeus and Demeter.
[2023-01-03 06:26:34] <%hokmon_> it's been a long time since I played, I forgot what the perk I used for it was
[2023-01-03 06:26:35] <%nola_epeeist> exit wounds great because bow makes them fall out faster
[2023-01-03 06:26:39] <morsecodec> Steve knows what’s up
[2023-01-03 06:27:00] <Hachiyon> the duo dio + demeter is sick tho
[2023-01-03 06:27:03] <%SteveSketches> @morsecodec <3 Finally the affirmation I think I deserve.  sketchyDerp
[2023-01-03 06:27:08] <%SteveSketches> They're comparable.  Both are super fun.
[2023-01-03 06:27:13] <sev_grey> aphodite is the usual choice for hera bow
[2023-01-03 06:27:15] <%$Illuna_Meira> I'd like to see how this run turns up but gotta sleep, have fun, enjoy chat oroOut
[2023-01-03 06:27:18] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Honestly you should just get the first cast thats Epic rarity
[2023-01-03 06:27:19] <+SoullesGaming> demeter dio on hera is very fun imo
[2023-01-03 06:27:20] <%SteveSketches> Aphro is a Shotgun, Dio is a dirty bomb.
[2023-01-03 06:27:25] <%$Illuna_Meira> turns out*
[2023-01-03 06:27:25] <+jPhamPham> I trust Steve with my firstborn
[2023-01-03 06:27:25] <HigBig> Wow, a ds1 speedrunner also proficient in food speedruns? damn Kappa
[2023-01-03 06:27:38] VIEWERS: 571
[2023-01-03 06:27:39] <sev_grey> dio casts take a long time to pick up, which is why most people go aphrodite
[2023-01-03 06:27:39] <HigBig> never stops to amaze an old dog Kappa
[2023-01-03 06:27:39] <SabreClass> can't wait to see what they come up with in hades 2 honestly lol
[2023-01-03 06:27:45] <%nola_epeeist> if you can get aphro, arty, and then pos, you can get the pos / arty duo and do insane damage.
[2023-01-03 06:27:47] <%SteveSketches> Oh yeah.  If you get Dio on Special and get his Legendary that's fun too.
[2023-01-03 06:27:57] <%OptPlaysGames> Fun WutFace
[2023-01-03 06:27:57] <%beau_xo> i remember aphro highing the highest numbers when i played
[2023-01-03 06:28:13] <%SteveSketches> Really there's no going wrong with Dio cast on Hera build.  Ares specs into it too if you get poison on Special.
[2023-01-03 06:28:16] <morsecodec> LUL you’re basically saying what I’m thinking. Cast builds are so fun when you have a plan
[2023-01-03 06:28:41] <%SteveSketches> I hated cast when I started.  Now most of my builds have become cast builds LUL
[2023-01-03 06:28:42] <%Evil_on_Paper> Whatcha eat anyways?
[2023-01-03 06:28:43] <%nola_epeeist> aphro is considerably better on bow. With casts overall dio with those duos is a high roll and major gamble. Lots of fun, but weak if you don't roll lucky
[2023-01-03 06:28:50] <%Evil_on_Paper> Nice
[2023-01-03 06:29:01] <%SlamDunkinson> god i want one of those so bad now
[2023-01-03 06:29:04] <%OptPlaysGames> You should get a gyro next time because it’s on theme
[2023-01-03 06:29:22] <%SteveSketches> Yeah, it helps to have lots of rerolls and optimizing luck and such.  RNG is always a factor.
[2023-01-03 06:29:23] <%Evil_on_Paper> May the god-pools be in your favor then
[2023-01-03 06:29:25] <morsecodec> Yep. When all the pieces fall into place, cast builds are super satisfying
[2023-01-03 06:29:26] <%beau_xo> chaos for extra cast is also important
[2023-01-03 06:29:38] VIEWERS: 571
[2023-01-03 06:29:38] <sev_grey> snow burst from demeter is also extremely good on hera
[2023-01-03 06:29:47] <%nola_epeeist> try to get pos as well. B/c pos arty duo doubles cast damage on bbow
[2023-01-03 06:29:48] <%SteveSketches> Yup, Aphro cast, then athena and artemis.  Dio or Zeus on special for extra spice.
[2023-01-03 06:30:01] <%jigglejuicegamez> dont forget to up the extreme measures Kappa
[2023-01-03 06:30:13] <%SteveSketches> No matter what, good luck, and have fun!

[2023-01-03 06:30:45] <+TheAssumingMage> TD one is actually free
[2023-01-03 06:30:48] <%+William_Kutter> Summons is better
[2023-01-03 06:30:51] <%SteveSketches> Just pause for afk LUL
[2023-01-03 06:30:52] <%nola_epeeist> TD1 mostly just gets rid of that annoying timed roomed in tart
[2023-01-03 06:30:53] <%SlamDunkinson> 9 mins is plenty plus it carries over between biomes
[2023-01-03 06:30:59] <morsecodec> Just have to pause while making decisions
[2023-01-03 06:31:01] <Lymnus> it's per region not run

[2023-01-03 06:31:05] <!%xperimentalsubject> I like Jury Summons NODDERS
[2023-01-03 06:31:10] <%nola_epeeist> But easiest thing is probably EM2
[2023-01-03 06:31:11] <+TheAssumingMage> Summons is more dangerous
[2023-01-03 06:31:11] <%SteveSketches> 9 minutes per region.
[2023-01-03 06:31:16] <%keeran8894> tho TD is really not bad at all
[2023-01-03 06:31:21] <+TheAssumingMage> Yep
[2023-01-03 06:31:23] <%SteveSketches> Yeah, it removes the timer room
[2023-01-03 06:31:24] <sev_grey> yeah
[2023-01-03 06:31:27] <%SteveSketches> Also the time stacks.
[2023-01-03 06:31:28] <rightsidedown> Try forced overtime for funzies

[2023-01-03 06:31:33] <%nola_epeeist> If you can learn it, FO is free, but it changes attack patterns and spawning rate

[2023-01-03 06:34:01] <%SteveSketches> Yup
[2023-01-03 06:34:03] <%nola_epeeist> yes
[2023-01-03 06:34:09] <+SoullesGaming> they do both dmg seperatly
[2023-01-03 06:34:11] <!%Ebonslayer> What's that timer in the corner?
[2023-01-03 06:34:15] <%nola_epeeist> both but mostly cast rn
[2023-01-03 06:34:16] <WyvernLink> it's both
[2023-01-03 06:34:20] <%nola_epeeist> base damage on cast is very high
[2023-01-03 06:34:21] <!%xperimentalsubject> @Ebonslayer Time limit for the biome
[2023-01-03 06:34:22] <%SteveSketches> Art or Aphro on attack.
[2023-01-03 06:34:22] <SabreClass> demeter maybe
[2023-01-03 06:34:23] <+SoullesGaming> any % dmg upgrade
[2023-01-03 06:34:25] <%nola_epeeist> Ideally? arty
[2023-01-03 06:34:32] <carrmig> chain shot is only for attack not cast
[2023-01-03 06:34:34] <+TheAssumingMage> I can't tell either
[2023-01-03 06:34:44] <%SteveSketches> Chain Shot doesn't carry cast
[2023-01-03 06:34:46] <%nola_epeeist> arty attack and pos dash is ideal
[2023-01-03 06:34:56] <%+GIHunter6> I think it just has a narrow bounce angle
[2023-01-03 06:35:08] <Mush_Brains> I prefer Dionysus with that bow.
[2023-01-03 06:35:10] <+SoullesGaming> arrow bounces. cast dosent
[2023-01-03 06:35:17] <SabreClass> it'd be broken af if it carried cast

[2023-01-03 06:48:14] <%nola_epeeist> @kingpinxxx in the speedrun mod, the boat is removed b/c of how annoying it is. Ironically, it's better on higher heat b/c of stuff you can do to speed it up.

[2023-01-03 07:04:31] <%Evil_on_Paper> But it'll drop 3 on the ground iummediately
[2023-01-03 07:04:36] <%nola_epeeist> but do one of them since fated and rare
[2023-01-03 07:04:36] <$arece_> reroll? :)
[2023-01-03 07:04:36] <+SoullesGaming> lightning rod is passive free dmg . capping ur god gage makes u not have the massive burst
[2023-01-03 07:04:36] <%hokmon_> still gets a tick or two in and makes your build more flexible
[2023-01-03 07:04:42] <RickyRelucent> hmmm fatedwhen else r u picking it lol
[2023-01-03 07:04:42] <%OptPlaysGames> if 3 wasn’t fated I wouldn’t take it
[2023-01-03 07:04:44] <%hokmon_> flexible is good
[2023-01-03 07:04:57] <%SteveSketches> No it doeasn't sadly
[2023-01-03 07:04:58] <Sandstormstillop> smoldering is stronger imo
[2023-01-03 07:04:58] <!%Ebonslayer> Capped at 25% though.
[2023-01-03 07:04:59] <%yugo_kale> like I said streamer
[2023-01-03 07:05:03] <RickyRelucent> smoldering would be nice, options optionsmoldering if both!
[2023-01-03 07:05:03] <%SteveSketches> You'll never be able to super ult with 2
[2023-01-03 07:05:04] <%yugo_kale> up to you
[2023-01-03 07:05:06] <%hokmon_> capped at 25% though
[2023-01-03 07:05:11] <+SoullesGaming> capped gauge makes u not have super gauge
[2023-01-03 07:05:11] <%hokmon_> yeah
[2023-01-03 07:05:11] <chiyo721> Rod is fine with hera bow
[2023-01-03 07:05:13] <%hokmon_> unfortunately
[2023-01-03 07:05:15] <+TheAssumingMage> yep
[2023-01-03 07:05:20] <PepeLaugg> But it refills in 5 seconds.
[2023-01-03 07:05:20] <+TheAssumingMage> just the pew
[2023-01-03 07:05:25] <%nola_epeeist> smouldering caps your gauge. So you only get the small one, but you get it constantly.
[2023-01-03 07:05:31] <RickyRelucent> yeah but after 20 seconds it'd already be completely full power
[2023-01-03 07:05:32] <%SteveSketches> Come ooooon Hermes Legendary....
[2023-01-03 07:05:35] <+TheAssumingMage> Any other call would be better
[2023-01-03 07:05:39] <+MackOfHearts> What would he do without chat?
[2023-01-03 07:05:44] <RickyRelucent> if u got one or two more boons for another percentage

[2023-01-03 07:19:56] <%nola_epeeist> @Ebonslayer the non-skull rooms take almost 2x as long. So if you don't need them to beat the game, it's better to grab the skull ones. so you'd have a 75% chance of not having to fight in one of those long-end rooms.

[2023-01-03 07:36:03] <%yugo_kale> yeah no telling about blah blah blah or blah blah  or blah and definitely not blah
[2023-01-03 07:36:05] <YamiXx> 5 to 10 hearts, depends on the person
[2023-01-03 07:36:07] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> You can try Undamaged perk in mirror
[2023-01-03 07:36:13] <%nola_epeeist> Hestia pretty weak without spending like 20 blood on it.
[2023-01-03 07:36:17] <+TheAssumingMage> The bow is already a sniper
[2023-01-03 07:36:18] <%SteveSketches> Yeah, just have to reload before every shot.  If you can't rebind it's a pain in the butt LUL
[2023-01-03 07:36:22] <kingpinxxx> it doesnt say in text but it increases your max range also @Oroboro
[2023-01-03 07:36:25] <RickyRelucent> ...try demeter with kinetic launcher
[2023-01-03 07:36:27] <%nola_epeeist> do you have the special spear yet?
[2023-01-03 07:36:27] <TheEnygma> max this one, the damage is stupid
[2023-01-03 07:36:28] <RickyRelucent> weapon
[2023-01-03 07:36:28] <+Graves102> @Oroboro I can't believe hestia had a glock
[2023-01-03 07:36:32] <%SlamDunkinson> shield?
[2023-01-03 07:36:32] <TheEnygma> the demeter fist
[2023-01-03 07:36:42] <RickyRelucent> or maybe quake cutter and flying cutter
[2023-01-03 07:36:46] <%yugo_kale> you should do a extreme measure run all bosses
[2023-01-03 07:36:52] <+Graves102> @Oroboro
[2023-01-03 07:36:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @Oroboro I'd recommend investing 5 titan blood into each weapon, including what you already invested from unlocking. Effectively, 3 titan blood per weapon except spear since Guan Yu needed 3 already.
[2023-01-03 07:37:01] <%SteveSketches> Beat the Skelly challange.
[2023-01-03 07:37:05] <+Graves102> what is this horrifc emote
[2023-01-03 07:37:08] <+Graves102> and why is it appearing
[2023-01-03 07:37:10] <RickyRelucent> kinda missing flying cutter + kinetic launcher, special is charged quicker and it did 100% extra dmg
[2023-01-03 07:37:15] <%SteveSketches> @Ebonslayer Why?
[2023-01-03 07:37:17] <RickyRelucent> was patched, sadge
[2023-01-03 07:37:27] <%yugo_kale> Graves what you talking about?
[2023-01-03 07:37:31] <!%Ebonslayer> @SteveSketches I'll DM you the reason.
[2023-01-03 07:37:33] <%hokmon_> chaos can be good to rank up
[2023-01-03 07:37:35] <RickyRelucent> no longer even selectable together

[2023-01-03 07:38:14] <%nola_epeeist> @Ebonslayer ^this is the fastest way to progress with weapons rn.
[2023-01-03 07:38:16] <MrPeer> chaos shield runs are really fun IMO
[2023-01-03 07:38:23] <@%Pallydan9K> mmh titan blood
[2023-01-03 07:38:34] <@%Pallydan9K> I need to watch the new owl house

[2023-01-03 07:38:57] <%SteveSketches> Love this game and can't wait to see more.
[2023-01-03 07:38:57] <%Kaine_san> never liked the shield
[2023-01-03 07:39:03] <%yugo_kale> night Steve
[2023-01-03 07:39:05] <YamiXx> so are the 4th aspects opened completely randomly? or is there like a prereq to unlock them?
[2023-01-03 07:39:09] <+VanOnTheMoon> shield was my first clear
[2023-01-03 07:39:17] <kingpinxxx> chaos is easy mode
[2023-01-03 07:39:17] <%hokmon_> chaos could use more investment
[2023-01-03 07:39:17] <RickyRelucent> shields can be good, theres alot of fun stuff there
[2023-01-03 07:39:17] <%SlamDunkinson> i'd throw one more lvl in at least
[2023-01-03 07:39:20] <%hokmon_> it helps
[2023-01-03 07:39:24] <%nola_epeeist> @Kaine_san Best shield is probably the hidden one. But it takes practice
[2023-01-03 07:39:26] <%beau_xo> i remember ares special on chaos shield
[2023-01-03 07:39:29] <%beau_xo> was fun
[2023-01-03 07:39:29] <%Pogarithmic> Chaos Shield really needs levels to shine
[2023-01-03 07:39:30] <%keeran8894> ahh chaos shield, used to be so good, but an upgrade broke it Sadge
[2023-01-03 07:39:32] <%hokmon_> I like having at least 3 shields coming out
[2023-01-03 07:39:33] <+VanOnTheMoon> it's much better ranked up
[2023-01-03 07:39:39] <kingpinxxx> Doom on shield is awsome
[2023-01-03 07:39:39] <%yugo_kale> never got into chaos to deeply fists were my favorite
[2023-01-03 07:39:42] <MrPeer> rank it up a bit yeah
[2023-01-03 07:39:47] <%SlamDunkinson> dio on chaos shield can be pretty solid

[2023-01-03 07:40:02] <RickyRelucent> i like fists and sword, kinetic launcher or piercing wave. hoarding slash :o
[2023-01-03 07:40:04] <%Kaine_san> @nola_epeeist yeah i know its pree good just prefer the longer range weps i think
[2023-01-03 07:40:06] <Hachiyon> dio or demeter would be good
[2023-01-03 07:40:10] <kingpinxxx> doom
[2023-01-03 07:40:12] <RickyRelucent> shields cool too
[2023-01-03 07:40:13] <%SlamDunkinson> any status effect is good on the special
[2023-01-03 07:40:16] <%beau_xo> i did doom
[2023-01-03 07:40:31] <%yugo_kale> DOOOOOOOMMMM
[2023-01-03 07:40:31] <MrPeer> I did something like ares attack and aprho special
[2023-01-03 07:40:34] <%Kaine_san> doom gamer
[2023-01-03 07:40:34] <%nola_epeeist> chaos shield is good for whacky stuff. Use special to paint whatever status you want.
[2023-01-03 07:40:35] <Hachiyon> yep stat effect
[2023-01-03 07:40:56] <+VanOnTheMoon> ares or demeter but if you have privileged status then status effects are good
[2023-01-03 07:40:56] <kingpinxxx> u can block pretty much anything
[2023-01-03 07:41:04] <RickyRelucent> rememer, theres more ways to inflict status then just attack, special, dash or call
[2023-01-03 07:41:12] <!%Ebonslayer> @Oroboro I'd recommend putting 5 titan blood on every weapon, counting what you've already invested through unlocking and, if applicable, upgrading aspects.
[2023-01-03 07:41:12] <RickyRelucent> c :
[2023-01-03 07:41:23] <RickyRelucent> its a big game, sorry for not being more helpful
[2023-01-03 07:41:27] <@%Pallydan9K> Can you block the awesome taste of cinnamon toast crunch
[2023-01-03 07:41:31] <%nola_epeeist> @Ebonslayer I think he's done this with most weapons.

[2023-01-03 07:41:52] <Hachiyon> LUL
[2023-01-03 07:41:56] <WyvernLink> try out Jury summons, might like it
[2023-01-03 07:42:02] <+VanOnTheMoon> I never use tight deadline, just don't like the timer
[2023-01-03 07:42:04] <birbsmas_> You should try Benefits Package
[2023-01-03 07:42:04] <@%Pallydan9K> time trials are such anxiety
[2023-01-03 07:42:05] <%SlamDunkinson> u did a lot of chests which dont pause the timer
[2023-01-03 07:42:11] <Hachiyon> yea especially for trying new build
[2023-01-03 07:42:28] <RickyRelucent> sudden rush?
[2023-01-03 07:42:37] <!%RedtailPinny> That's the cool thing about the pact of punishment: You can do what you want Kappa
[2023-01-03 07:42:37] <%beau_xo> its 2 right?
[2023-01-03 07:42:40] <RickyRelucent> its all fun
[2023-01-03 07:42:41] <kingpinxxx> 3
[2023-01-03 07:42:44] <%nola_epeeist> You'll get faster. If you haven't done the others, I think there's a prophesy for winning with each type of heat.
[2023-01-03 07:42:46] <%keeran8894> speedruns on this game get NUTS!
[2023-01-03 07:42:50] <RickyRelucent> pulverising? ehh person to person basis
[2023-01-03 07:42:59] <%nola_epeeist> yeah, normally if you have TD, you don't do chests
[2023-01-03 07:43:03] <kingpinxxx> depends what ur building towards
[2023-01-03 07:43:03] <%SlamDunkinson> both pretty good
[2023-01-03 07:43:06] <kingpinxxx> i lke 3
[2023-01-03 07:43:08] <WyvernLink> could go with a bull rush build with this
[2023-01-03 07:43:08] <%beau_xo> 3 is good too
[2023-01-03 07:43:09] <RickyRelucent> dashing, its both fast
[2023-01-03 07:43:09] <%yugo_kale> SR
[2023-01-03 07:43:14] <RickyRelucent> maybe take sudden down the line
[2023-01-03 07:43:18] <+headofthewood> 3 with your aspect
[2023-01-03 07:43:19] <RickyRelucent> or the other way
[2023-01-03 07:43:31] <%hokmon_> I find sudden rush makes it flow better
[2023-01-03 07:43:33] <RickyRelucent> theres a fireball for shield too.
[2023-01-03 07:43:36] <MrPeer> both work well tbh
[2023-01-03 07:43:38] <RickyRelucent> like kinetic launcher for fists

[2023-01-03 07:44:18] <%yugo_kale> shield with posidon is good
[2023-01-03 07:44:23] <MrPeer> you don't need to max charge for chaos to take effect
[2023-01-03 07:44:30] <WyvernLink> just holding the charge saves you on many hits

[2023-01-03 07:57:55] <rayne2914> this game worth playing?
[2023-01-03 07:58:05] <!%Ebonslayer> @RickyRelucent Wanna hear some fucked up shit? Demeter is Zeus' (and by extension Hades') sister. Persephone is her daughter. That means Zagreus' mother is also his cousin.
[2023-01-03 07:58:07] <SuburbanSocrates> Too many games, not enough time.
[2023-01-03 07:58:30] <NastyNote> I'm glad people have been playing this game again recently. One of my faves
[2023-01-03 07:58:34] <+kjr59> Goat roguelike IMO
[2023-01-03 07:58:34] <TroIIdier> @SuburbanSocrates FEelsBadMan So damn true
[2023-01-03 07:58:35] <RickyRelucent> thats sounds like greek mythology alright
[2023-01-03 07:58:43] <+kjr59> At least action roguelikes
[2023-01-03 07:58:44] <%+Dazitup> it's controlled rng yeh
[2023-01-03 07:58:55] <%Evil_on_Paper> You can deviate towards your desired build kinda?
[2023-01-03 07:58:59] <MrPeer> you can manipulate your odds better
[2023-01-03 07:59:01] <RickyRelucent> i have one too
[2023-01-03 07:59:07] <RickyRelucent> ..dusa is headless cuz of perseus
[2023-01-03 07:59:11] <%Banjaxed_> @RickyRelucent within this game at least, demeter isn't related to zeus and the boys by blood
[2023-01-03 07:59:32] <%hokmon_> yeah, sure

[2023-01-03 08:00:11] <WyvernLink> thats a 2 reroll room
[2023-01-03 08:00:15] <rayne2914> how many hours of gameplay does this game roughly have?
[2023-01-03 08:00:23] <RickyRelucent> there is, priveledged status
[2023-01-03 08:00:28] <MrPeer> might get lucky with eury to upgrade rarity
[2023-01-03 08:00:30] <SuburbanSocrates> It's the normal enemy version of the witches.
[2023-01-03 08:00:33] <!%Ebonslayer> @RickyRelucent Within the mythology proper that is the case.
[2023-01-03 08:01:17] <SuburbanSocrates> Poseidon has a good duo with Dio.

[2023-01-03 08:02:30] <TroIIdier> Eyyy
[2023-01-03 08:02:43] <WyvernLink> that aid is good
[2023-01-03 08:02:47] <RickyRelucent> stupid maybe, but is there even a Zagreus in mythology?
[2023-01-03 08:02:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @RickyRelucent Yeah.
[2023-01-03 08:02:57] <RickyRelucent> hmmmm
[2023-01-03 08:03:01] <SuburbanSocrates> When in doubt, I usually take the one with the highest rarity.
[2023-01-03 08:03:15] <+The_NightShader> I heard that car
[2023-01-03 08:03:16] <SuburbanSocrates> (Really though, Demeter's Aid is one of the best calls.

[2023-01-03 08:03:55] <%nola_epeeist> @SuburbanSocrates Demeter's aid is also good b/c it keeps Theseus from using it against you.
[2023-01-03 08:04:24] <+The_NightShader> well are you gonna play the beta?
[2023-01-03 08:04:25] <SuburbanSocrates> @nola_epeeist Good point.
[2023-01-03 08:04:27] <Commonness> @oroboro not really. zagreus is very vague character, that's why they were able to do so much with him
[2023-01-03 08:04:32] <TroIIdier> I like how even Supergiant was like "Yeah let's do this one again"
[2023-01-03 08:04:42] <!%Ebonslayer> @RickyRelucent To my memory, he's in some way related to Dionysus.

[2023-01-03 08:07:11] <+kjr59> You should be using the mirror upgrade that gives you a damage boost if you have 2 status conditions. It’s rly strong
[2023-01-03 08:07:19] <SuburbanSocrates> Keep the pom on for now.
[2023-01-03 08:07:20] <WyvernLink> yep just keep that pom

[2023-01-03 08:07:23] <%nola_epeeist> Demeter also has a boon that just flat out kills enemies (even bosses) once they HP is low enough.

[2023-01-03 08:17:47] <SuburbanSocrates> @Oroboro For future runs: When you decline a hammer in Elysium, then take the shop before the boss, there will be a hammer in the shop 100% of the time.

[2023-01-03 08:20:02] <SuburbanSocrates> Basically, the game will try to make sure you have a weapon upgrade even if you turn it down earlier. For example, if you turn down hammers in Tartarus, the first room in Asphodel will almost always have a hammer.

[2023-01-03 08:42:54] <ooups_vl> What's ambrosia for?
[2023-01-03 08:43:11] <SuburbanSocrates> @ooups_vl Premium quality gift. Required to advance the story.
[2023-01-03 08:43:20] <Gebrant> @ooups_vl gettin drunk
[2023-01-03 08:43:42] <chiyo721> diamonds for the thing

[2023-01-03 08:43:58] <YamiXx> now enough dias for both things
[2023-01-03 08:44:18] <shadowblight7> how do you get the hidden aspects?
[2023-01-03 08:44:29] <shadowblight7> nothing I've done has unlocked them
[2023-01-03 08:45:14] <!%Ebonslayer> @shadowblight7 As with everything, it's somewhat RNG dependent.
[2023-01-03 08:45:41] <Rokynn> try to lift
[2023-01-03 08:45:47] <!%Ebonslayer> Did you see the prompt? You can lift them.
[2023-01-03 08:45:48] <+Jaysmooth513_> Lift?

[2023-01-03 08:45:56] <MassivePanda22> good morning oroboro
[2023-01-03 08:45:59] <%Kaine_san> r1 to lift
[2023-01-03 08:46:07] <shadowblight7> @Ebonslayer I've legit started doing suicide runs just to reload the house and I've not gotten  the phrases yet
[2023-01-03 08:46:15] <shadowblight7> rng must really fucking hate me
[2023-01-03 08:46:20] <dagrotus> priviliged is insane dps
[2023-01-03 08:46:30] <%+GIHunter6> Privileged Status is great if you're going for double status boons
[2023-01-03 08:46:38] <chiyo721> Priviliged is better when you know you're getting a status curse, like doom or dio
[2023-01-03 08:46:47] <chiyo721> Or weakness
[2023-01-03 08:47:07] <!AuroraUnit486> styjian
[2023-01-03 08:47:08] <%+GIHunter6> The G in Stygian is pronounced like a J
[2023-01-03 08:47:13] <!%Ebonslayer> @shadowblight7 To my understanding it also requires having invested 5 titan blood in the weapon besides spear.
[2023-01-03 08:47:18] <chiyo721> You should try out priv status since it's new to you
[2023-01-03 08:47:25] <shadowblight7> I've done that
[2023-01-03 08:47:25] <SuburbanSocrates> For example, Priveleged Status would have been amazing on your last run.
[2023-01-03 08:47:26] <makoStygian> moon2S
[2023-01-03 08:47:34] <shadowblight7> I've legit looked up a guide for it
[2023-01-03 08:47:34] <!%Ebonslayer> @shadowblight7 Then pray.
[2023-01-03 08:47:46] <shadowblight7> been about 30 runs since I got the requirements

[2023-01-03 08:47:59] <!%Ebonslayer> Shield?
[2023-01-03 08:48:04] <DeathFrown> Beware.
[2023-01-03 08:48:11] <YamiXx> time to say the magic words and unlock shielf last aspect
[2023-01-03 08:48:39] <+VanOnTheMoon> super fun aspect
[2023-01-03 08:48:52] <chiyo721> Hera bow, but a shield
[2023-01-03 08:49:00] <WyvernLink> like hera but on the rush
[2023-01-03 08:49:01] <%Pogarithmic> Beowulf can be awkward to use at first, but it's absolutely insane when you get the hang of it.
[2023-01-03 08:49:05] <kingpinxxx> omg lol
[2023-01-03 08:49:19] <chiyo721> This is another good one for privileged status
[2023-01-03 08:49:21] <kingpinxxx> sick
[2023-01-03 08:49:34] <%+Teacher_Tim> dio cast really cool with this
[2023-01-03 08:49:46] <+VanOnTheMoon> there's a hammer that turns it into a cannon for casts
[2023-01-03 08:49:48] <Commonness> @oroboro if I remember correctly Beowulf is strongest weapon in the game
[2023-01-03 08:49:54] <%+GIHunter6> Athena & Poseidon with this would be a good ocmbo
