[2022-12-08 16:25:10] <%TardigradesAreAwesome> you think you could finish rank 1 with your old max lvl?
[2022-12-08 16:25:16] <JesssOW> but it's not always the skill right, if your teammates are making it easy to kill them, while the enemy is playing smart, you won't carry more than the other dps
[2022-12-08 16:25:17] <%+TheTurtleHax> I think it orobs needs a cap so new players can catch up and people can drop
[2022-12-08 16:25:36] <@%PayMeToThrow> what to even do against doom 3 second punch
[2022-12-08 16:25:48] <%Fjellern1> when do you know you got 5k sr ??
[2022-12-08 16:25:51] <spaxnooo> emongg might be higher level but he isn't as good as cloudy so he probs won't hit rank1

[2022-12-08 21:35:08] <%+Aceattack> so mercy is now meta because of sojourn? amazing how reworking dmg works in game
[2022-12-08 21:35:10] <%islviking> THATS DISRESPECTFUL
[2022-12-08 21:35:21] <Sakkoliha> when you say that tanks are irrelevant, do you mean tanks or rein?

[2022-12-08 21:36:50] <doomfeminist> Why every game has mercy? Mercy is the hero whose users have no eyes nose and arms
[2022-12-08 21:36:59] <jamescgy> @d1vai there are map pools now
