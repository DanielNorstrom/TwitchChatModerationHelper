[2022-12-27 04:44:56] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-27 04:54:50] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-27 05:03:38] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

And then sometimes if that wasn’t bad enough sometimes you go and just invent new Overwatches. Like just when I’m getting a handle on what “Junkrat kin discourse” is yall show up with “This is my new OC her name is Grandma Sniper” and then SHE’S part of the Overwatchers. “This is Swedish Beefcake” could yall? not?? I still don’t know what a Hanzo is.

Now, hypothetically, what would your response be?

[2022-12-27 06:34:09] <%Electrified14> I don’t know what Overwatch is. There’s a gorilla and some lesbians and guns but yall never play the gorilla I don’t know. And then sometimes if that wasn’t bad enough sometimes you go and just invent new Overwatches. Like just when I’m getting a handle on what “Junkrat kin discourse” is yall show up with “This is my new OC her name is Grandma Sniper” and then SHE’S part of the Overwatchers. “This is Swedish Beefcake” could yall? not?? I still don’t know what a Hanzo is.

[2022-12-27 06:42:39] <drunkrat0> I don’t know what Overwatch is. There’s a gorilla and some lesbians and guns but yall never play the gorilla I don’t know. And then sometimes if that wasn’t bad enough sometimes you go and just invent new Overwatches. Like just when I’m getting a handle on what “Junkrat kin discourse” is yall show up with “This is my new OC her name is Grandma Sniper” and then SHE’S part of the Overwatchers. “This is Swedish Beefcake” could yall? not??

[2022-12-27 16:43:39] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-27 16:55:38] <+kostinoLoL> Automatic is literally better than the best drivers. The only reason they dont have it in F1 is becauser it would kinda ruin the competition like with ABS
[2022-12-27 16:55:38] <slowracer10> @hydrophobicpowder yes so has clutch and have to change gears, kinda like a dirt bike if you know that

[2022-12-27 16:55:48] <rozlen06> automatics are faster than manuals

[2022-12-27 16:56:02] <%night_wolfiez> dont think that there are many manual cars left. Most are now tiptronics
[2022-12-27 16:56:03] <+bab3wley> automatic transmission just gives everyone more opportunity to stare at their phones since they're so disengaged from actually driving.

[2022-12-27 16:56:15] <+MrDabenport> lol
[2022-12-27 16:56:16] <SweSebbe> ok aparently automatic has multiple losses in the drive system wich means they are "less" effective than manual.
[2022-12-27 16:56:17] <%xsansthecomic> was your first ever car a manual?

[2022-12-27 16:56:34] <olliehw1> @SkitzoCTRL okay bro
[2022-12-27 16:56:35] <+WeedBullet> In terms of performance Manual will always outclass Automatic. Automatics are much more "user friendly" though
[2022-12-27 16:56:36] <Korporal_Kagger> Google says old automatics were inefficient because of torque converter slipage. Modern automatics don't have that problem, but the transmission is heavier so the extra weight can counteract increased efficiency

[2022-12-27 16:57:07] <slowracer10> @kostinoLoL nah Automatic would make f1 much slower, controlling the RPS allows you to get the most out of the car.  Now for drag racing most people do automatic and program the car when to change gers per the RPS you want

[2022-12-27 17:03:33] <%black_stabath> I think you’d like hunt showdown. It’s a creature horror game where you need to kill a certain amount of monsters and there are other players in the lobby too so it’s a BR basically with monsters set in the 80s or something. Very fun and exciting game!

[2022-12-27 17:14:20] <%ow_sigmaeats> @weboremerald and 99% of TikTok content is onlyfan users
[2022-12-27 17:14:23] <MizaThePizza> Drama + Niche + Using viral sounds like those Wednesdays dance, will give better algorithm hit. Oh plus doing that, "this is what will happen in this episode" at the start @Flats
[2022-12-27 17:14:33] <%xsansthecomic> I've noticed when I make my anime edits usually the viewership lasts bout 5seconds then they leave

[2022-12-27 17:14:36] <oztw> @frostysquidkid the thing is lootboxes will only work if the game is a paid product but free2play brings more players to the game so its the better option for the health of the game even if it means we are not getting cosmetics anymore ingame
[2022-12-27 17:14:39] <%juicel0l> i hate the people who make part 2s when its so unnecessary but ig it brings more views

[2022-12-27 17:24:40] <%GhostshipRobot> Random thoughts this morning. Fix for Ball. Give Shield a 360 knockback. Would give more use to using Shield in motion and break up the current obvious cooldown rotation. Rolling by an edge and hitting E for boops as well as giving a little more survivability.

[2022-12-27 17:34:25] <@%chompchomp8> QP has skill based match making, but the range of mmr it will give you is much larger than comp because it mostly focuses on building the lobby fast. If it tried to get a game of 10 top500s in qp it would take forever. I would guess the average rank in one of Flats' qp lobbies is masters anywats

[2022-12-27 17:37:29] <%SkitzoCTRL> @truepotatoking1 The biggest thing I miss about two tanks is being able to duo queue with a friend as tanks. Being the tank duo felt really good and you could make a game go any way you wanted as tank duo.

I had this idea floating in my head how Blizz could soft rework his heal so that it would change from a single-time use to a useable at any time, same amout of heal but way slower drain (less heal overtime) and a recharge similar to moiras primary

[2022-12-27 19:10:22] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-27 20:27:38] <%Electrified14> I don’t know what Overwatch is. There’s a gorilla and some women and guns but yall never play the gorilla I don’t know. And then sometimes if that wasn’t bad enough sometimes you go and just invent new Overwatches. Like just when I’m getting a handle on what “Junkrat kin discourse” is yall show up with “This is my new OC her name is Grandma Sniper” and then SHE’S part of the Overwatchers. “This is Swedish Beefcake” could yall? not?? I still don’t know what a Hanzo is.

[2022-12-27 21:27:36] <%oxijinn> how would you buff rein if at all? I feel like charge could be buffed to 250 dmg or the range of grab instead of boop improved, because then it would be worth more of the risk, but then he could be too strong.

[2022-12-27 22:23:39] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
