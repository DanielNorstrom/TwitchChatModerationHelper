[2023-01-03 06:25:44] <medichamp2005> Head or heart?
[2023-01-03 06:25:53] <StarsyNA> The Stars had that happen to one of their players about 6 or 7 years back.. Rich Peverley
[2023-01-03 06:26:16] <%$jrebert1> Cool they suspended game
[2023-01-03 06:26:29] <StarsyNA> he collapsed on the bench and his heart had completely stopped beating for like 20 seconds.. they managed to get him back up in the tunnel
[2023-01-03 06:26:29] <%blondejohn96> if CPR was administered then i think it must have been cardiac arrest
[2023-01-03 06:26:52] <%brightside2016> was argurably the biggest game of the year too
[2023-01-03 06:27:11] <tyb3riuss> heard the bills are flying back to buffalo tonight as well
[2023-01-03 06:27:12] <+EppiDK> He had cpr and they used a AED, his vitals are normal but he‚Äôs not breathing on his own
[2023-01-03 06:27:21] <StarsyNA> damn
[2023-01-03 06:27:26] <eric711> all the fantasy league are in limbo during the finals too.. not that it matters in the grand scheme of this players health
[2023-01-03 06:27:38] VIEWERS: 219
[2023-01-03 06:27:38] <%medricx> so could be heart damage?
[2023-01-03 06:28:18] <%medricx> that's really sad hopefully makes full recovery Sadge
[2023-01-03 06:29:01] <StarsyNA> I think they probably would have asked the players if they wanted to go on with the game and the answer probably came back no
[2023-01-03 06:29:38] VIEWERS: 219
[2023-01-03 06:29:42] <medichamp2005> Can they just agree to a tie
[2023-01-03 06:29:57] <%$OldBlackNerd> They didn‚Äôt want to still play
[2023-01-03 06:30:07] <%$OldBlackNerd> No one
[2023-01-03 06:30:43] <%$OldBlackNerd> They decided not to be ghouls
[2023-01-03 06:30:46] <%$the1pickleking> wot is it?
[2023-01-03 06:30:49] <medichamp2005> Football is quite dangerous

[2023-01-03 06:31:09] <StarsyNA> is football dying off?
[2023-01-03 06:31:21] <StarsyNA> I know baseball is.. not so sure about football

[2023-01-03 06:32:06] <eric711> but in fairness it does not look like the hit is was caused the issue, it was pretty normal plau
[2023-01-03 06:32:14] <%medricx> Google says football popularity has been slowly declining for a decade
[2023-01-03 06:32:19] <StarsyNA> I mean hockey is a dying game too as it combines being really unsafe with being stupid expensive lol
[2023-01-03 06:32:23] <StarsyNA> the worst of both worlds
[2023-01-03 06:32:38] <%$jrebert1> Bad play on his part

[2023-01-03 06:33:45] <%LittleWing322> Football more like CTE simulator
[2023-01-03 06:34:11] <StarsyNA> actually my buddy dove headfirst trying to get a ball in pickleball and ended up ramming a concrete column.. split his forehead open.. I guess no sport is safe
[2023-01-03 06:34:37] <%ApatheticOne> ahh the ole pickleball league
[2023-01-03 06:34:41] <StarsyNA> and it's funny because it's long been claimed that soccer is actually worse for CTE than football.. the repetitive heading of the ball apparently can really cause problems
[2023-01-03 06:34:52] <%ApatheticOne> back in my day all the balls were pickled
[2023-01-03 06:34:57] <medichamp2005> I was never good at heading though lol
[2023-01-03 06:35:06] <%icebergcl> its like playing tennis with a whiffleball i think
[2023-01-03 06:35:12] <StarsyNA> well
[2023-01-03 06:35:28] <StarsyNA> it's kind of a cross between tennis and badminton

[2023-01-03 06:36:29] <medichamp2005> It‚Äôs easier than tennis if you can‚Äôt move very athletically
[2023-01-03 06:36:29] <%LittleWing322> POGGIES pickleball highlights
[2023-01-03 06:36:54] <StarsyNA> you're not allowed to run up to the net
[2023-01-03 06:36:58] <StarsyNA> you have to stand behind the line
[2023-01-03 06:37:01] <%LittleWing322> Competitive frisbeeing  looked cool
[2023-01-03 06:37:08] <%+d3vbr4h> it's like a cross of ping-pong and tennis
[2023-01-03 06:37:19] <StarsyNA> and basically the game is just barely tapping the ball over the net because if you elevate the ball at all you're almost sure to lose
[2023-01-03 06:37:42] <%$abumizaiko> red is too busy w hus competitive dancing career to pick up pickleball

[2023-01-03 06:37:55] <$ralp00> the blue squares are called the picklezones, you're not allowed to advance the ball there until your team has established a full pickle
[2023-01-03 06:38:24] <%LittleWing322> turned himself into a pickle; funniest shit ive ever seen

[2023-01-03 09:18:13] <StarsyNA> really? that spell that did damage to a minion and then the rest to face used 1 on the DS and sent the rest face
[2023-01-03 09:18:13] <%+jascallion> i think overflow works like explosive runes does, it would summon the stats as if it didn't have divine shield

[2023-01-03 09:57:16] <sug0nd33z> Fart fetishism‚Äîalso known as eproctophilia‚Äîinvolves being sexually aroused by anal flatulence. As is the case with many other fetishes, sexual arousal can arise from different situations for different members of the eproctophilia community. Some individuals are at their horniest when farting on their sexual partners, whereas others are most turned-on by the act of being farted upon.

[2023-01-03 11:51:45] <%talrielz> the problem with this meta is like usually the draft is the most exciting part but now im not really sure what im excited to draft. DK means i win but its more boring than it was and then every other class is either boring or u get a deck that could be fun but that just means u get ur hopes up to get shit on lol

[2023-01-03 11:59:40] <@%+smellyhead> i don't wanna know the splits he used
[2023-01-03 12:00:13] <%talrielz> i was lurking earlier when you said that he would be an incompetent lover and it made me laugh

[2023-01-03 12:02:33] <%kaenni> you think people who speedrun a game haven't played thru it normally for like 100 times?
[2023-01-03 12:02:37] <%GenMacAtk> Zfg the #1 100% ocarina of time speedrunner streams and that's pretty great. Think his record is just shy of 3hrs now
[2023-01-03 12:02:55] <KULIXIS> I know it was just funny to say "Clint have you tried playing the game slower? It might be more enjoyable"

[2023-01-03 12:03:43] <%Kaguyavn> can you develop a few more wins for this deck
[2023-01-03 12:03:51] <%talrielz> this deck is the worst pile of puke ive seen and its better than 2 out of my last 3 runs and at worst ties my best of those 3 lmao
[2023-01-03 12:04:16] <%talrielz> i swear i was good at this game once
[2023-01-03 12:04:16] <%GenMacAtk> I normally don't like things like wrong warps but ocarina of time 100% is still so long even with them

[2023-01-03 12:05:57] <Roderlump> the chance of victory strongly resembles the chance of one individual suffering a heart attack in the next minutes
[2023-01-03 12:06:15] <%talrielz> yeah the value of singles compared to the pull rates has always been very sad lol
[2023-01-03 12:06:23] <%talrielz> it is for sure more about like knowing u pulled it yourself and the memory

[2023-01-03 12:07:15] <MagicalBS> what happened to the priest deck? just went to clean my cellar for an hour and you're already deep in another run :D
[2023-01-03 12:07:36] <MagicalBS> oh nice!
[2023-01-03 12:07:37] <%talrielz> its hilarious that this game has become akin to like me studying and forcing myself to do x amount of something before i can do something actually enjoyable
[2023-01-03 12:08:07] <%+fiximol> talrielz sounds like he is in a bad relationship FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-03 12:08:29] <!%GeordieTwitch> 12 wins is doable for RB but the 12-0 runs seem very rare
[2023-01-03 12:08:40] <%talrielz> hearthstone is my longest relationship and boy is it abusive @fiximol
[2023-01-03 12:08:50] <%talrielz> and it very rarely gets me off
