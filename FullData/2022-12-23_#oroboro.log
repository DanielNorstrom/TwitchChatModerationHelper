[2022-12-23 01:38:35] <theoceanmotion> like what?
[2022-12-23 01:38:47] <!%MadGamer> for example give the next one a rocket launcher Kappa
[2022-12-23 01:38:47] <%znowazorza> flying killers
[2022-12-23 01:38:52] <%LuminArcTech> they can do new abilities, but it would require new code and animations
[2022-12-23 01:39:06] <Comb_Tank> @MadGamer Nemesis would be very jelaous
[2022-12-23 01:39:08] <J1mb_0> well they also keep making up that fake survivor killer every 2 days Kappa
[2022-12-23 01:39:22] <%znowazorza> look at these people just sandbagging their teammates
[2022-12-23 01:39:23] <!%Hilink24> problem is when the devs read the forums and see something they specifically make a killer not do that very thing

[2022-12-23 02:07:12] <@%Pallydan9K> @Illuna_Meira that's your primal instincts trying to keep you alive fighting your logical human brain that knows you're not in danger
[2022-12-23 02:07:13] <NeededElsweyr_> I'm no DBD player, but complaining about tunneling feels like the same energy as complaining about roll catch exploit.

[2022-12-23 02:07:30] <VyrealsCosmos> Should the killer just rp and hit everyone once so they can get out as a group lol?

[2022-12-23 03:15:01] <%+a_angry_bunny> @DragonLordRossolon The problem isnt that the knight cant get downs, the issue is that he is easy to counter and he isnt fun to play or play against for most people.

[2022-12-23 05:43:21] <%direwolfnotinbed> How could you use nurse as if it was acceptable in an honorable fight? Don’t you know it’s the best killer because of how it doesn't allow survivors to bully them? Not to mention the blinks and mobilty. Can you really stoop so low as to say you’re good when you’re using nurse?

[2022-12-23 06:23:54] <dleon331> Wait they made that on purpose????I gotta play wesker again that's amazing

[2022-12-23 06:30:44] <+Hypersleep_AU> @HollowYourself having never played the game i can imagine successfully looping and ditching a killer in chase to be the thrill/cool moment
[2022-12-23 06:30:57] <+profpillz> im not sure if she even can heal it at this point
[2022-12-23 06:31:07] <dleon331> every time I play killer, when I lose it sucks. when I win, it sucks. nothing feels good. its just stressful. like dont get me wrong. killing everyone is nice I guess. but it doesnt ever feel that great winning. at least not lately for me. maybe it's time I take a break
[2022-12-23 06:31:26] <+Hypersleep_AU> honestly i think the problem with survivor is that the "ideal game" is one where you literally just do a few QTE's and leave, and the fun is from the killer chasing you
[2022-12-23 06:31:35] <+profpillz> honestly very weird

[2022-12-23 06:40:12] <!%+Nekracyst> Anyone who thinks nurse isnt OP is delusional
[2022-12-23 06:40:18] <Kaminoyouni> you know would be a neat addition to t he game, The Thing, with MacReady as the survivor

[2022-12-23 06:47:59] <thamandalor> okay so what if i use pineapple as the base of the pizza is that okay
[2022-12-23 06:48:00] <sirisecho> i used to get only cheese/mushroom on my pizzas from godfathers, idk dood
[2022-12-23 06:48:01] <!Sir__Nova> It's a psychopath thing if you eat a cheese pizza without any extra cheese

[2022-12-23 06:49:10] <!$Eric4bz> I hope not. Killers don't need any buffs - it's hard enough to play when any killer 'tier' can just camp and tunnel like any brain dead twelve your old. How is it fun let alone fair to face a killer who doesn't play by the rules?

[2022-12-23 06:50:59] <@%Pallydan9K> oh the ubisoft launcher
[2022-12-23 06:51:07] <LeoDeck> why not buy the more expensive stuff so you'd burn through the bps faster?
[2022-12-23 06:51:12] <amazingrdrplayer> I've never played for honor before what's it like?
[2022-12-23 06:51:15] <SkyBlue_DRGN> lol ubisoft
[2022-12-23 06:51:23] <@%Pallydan9K> yeah I don't want to go through the trouble of getting that setup again

[2022-12-23 06:51:35] <dleon331> @eric4bz I'm glad this is ironic
[2022-12-23 06:51:35] <!$Eric4bz> *for as long as we host the live service and you pay us
[2022-12-23 06:51:41] <SkyBlue_DRGN> Played early for honor and lost the game when they added too much new stuff, hope they rebalanced everything
[2022-12-23 06:51:45] <!$Eric4bz> @dleon331 someone out there sure as shit ain't saying it ironically
[2022-12-23 06:52:02] <LeoDeck> fair
[2022-12-23 06:52:05] <%LuminArcTech> it should just have an option for instant fill or slow fill since i figure it's to insure people don't misclick

[2022-12-23 06:52:34] <dleon331> @eric4bz oh definitely. have you ever looked at the comments under DBD instagram posts?
[2022-12-23 06:52:43] <+suboptimal__> FH is probably in its best spot right now. it's still getting support for content and balance changes. new characters
[2022-12-23 06:52:43] <Rune_Brandr> @amazingrdrplayer 50 levels but 100 prestiges
[2022-12-23 06:52:58] <Rune_Brandr> At Prestige 100 it's just infinite I guess
[2022-12-23 06:53:00] <+suboptimal__> old characters getting reworked
[2022-12-23 06:53:04] <dleon331> @eric4bz I saw people UNIRONICALLY saying knight was OP at CAMPING. like bruh just ignore the guards lmao
[2022-12-23 06:53:12] <SkyBlue_DRGN> @suboptimal__ finally, needed
[2022-12-23 06:53:24] <Rennat47> 😭 I got RPD again

[2022-12-23 06:53:36] <+suboptimal__> Jorm rework in testing grounds right now
[2022-12-23 06:53:43] <Rune_Brandr> @dleon331 Knight is good at camping *objectives*. You yourself can camp a hook near a gen and secure the area with guards.
[2022-12-23 06:54:01] <Rune_Brandr> It's not the guards that are good at the camping
[2022-12-23 06:54:08] <+TheFluxSTL> hag? ;)

[2022-12-23 06:54:33] <SkyBlue_DRGN> Dream is in this game?
[2022-12-23 06:54:38] <dleon331> @rune_brandr now that is true. but I've seen people say he is good at camping hooks and I just facepalm everytime. like honestly if you play knight in low MMR he seems stronger than nurse cause survivors are so afraid of the damn guards
[2022-12-23 06:54:38] <Rune_Brandr> Sadge Not wesking time

[2022-12-23 06:55:03] <Rune_Brandr> @dleon331 True, all you have to do is tap a hook and the guard is gone. He is def a good noob stomper.
[2022-12-23 06:55:27] <Rune_Brandr> Oro, I've become a Wesker main and I develop depression when I am not indulging in Wesking times.

[2022-12-23 06:55:38] <dleon331> the amount of times I've died on hook because the survivors are afraid to come near the hook because a damn guard is camping me is ridiculous
[2022-12-23 06:55:43] <melano646> soo cold here.
[2022-12-23 06:55:44] <@%Pallydan9K> Yo fight me

[2022-12-23 06:56:56] <+TheFluxSTL> they should not.

[2022-12-23 06:57:40] <+kryptoking_ttv> @rune_brandr yeah I guess you're right haha
[2022-12-23 06:57:48] <dleon331> I've had a friend say they should make Patrick Bateman as a killer but I said that makes no sense. but then they reminded me they somehow came up with a power for just some normal teenagers sooooo maybe Bateman would work somehow?

[2022-12-23 07:03:10] <dleon331> dead hard first got nerfed and then nobody used it for a short while. I loved that short period where there was basically no dead hard and we could just swing when we saw an injured survivor instead of stare at them for 5 years
[2022-12-23 07:03:10] <%direwolfnotinbed> i remember when DS used to be good
