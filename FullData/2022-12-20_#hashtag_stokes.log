[2022-12-20 11:42:55] <%+palachu_04> in my opinion they needed an extra midfielder versus Argentina and their right side with Dembele and Kounde

[2022-12-20 11:42:57] <+Taylor_98> I won’t varane and Martinez won’t be knackered for the rest of the season now for us, they obviously won’t be playing in the Burnley game tomorrow

[2022-12-20 11:59:23] <SMACKYOU4NOTHING> Same with free kicks. Only need to pass two times to be clear in front of goal.
[2022-12-20 11:59:50] <%DadDy_CoOl7> isn't fifa all about picking right xg shots against different players?

[2022-12-20 12:24:32] <stepdro> They’ve added a new press this year. You tap the R1 twice but on the second press hold it down.
[2022-12-20 12:24:35] <walker1231> double r1 press is useful
[2022-12-20 12:24:41] <stepdro> Its not great though

[2022-12-20 12:46:36] <sammyghj> @ItalianVortix you dont need max chem but it is important would recommend to stay over 20 total and to try and have every player on atleast two chem but in the end is your choice if you have a really good player 1 chem might be better than a worse player
