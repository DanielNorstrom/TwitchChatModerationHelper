[2023-01-04 06:37:46] <StarsyNA> The Stars have the best record in the league when they are winning after 2 and the best record in the league when trailing after 2 but they are 5-9 when tied after 2 now lol

[2023-01-04 06:41:31] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I think the biggest flaw is the predatory store. I had a lot of hope for it

[2023-01-04 06:41:57] <@%gesticulate> Sadge I wanted a demonic tutor
[2023-01-04 06:42:14] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I wrote them PAGES of ways they could make the game feel good and not predatory. did they listen or even reply? Nope. Idk why they let me in the closed beta KEKW
[2023-01-04 06:42:14] <%talrielz> i went to the predatory store once, Harvey Weinstein greeted me at the door and R. Kelly rang me up at the register. I think I saw Bill Cosby watching the changing rooms
[2023-01-04 06:42:17] <StarsyNA> Hearthstone kind of the opposite.. when you start out you have no resources but then after a few months of playing you can kind of do whatever you want
[2023-01-04 06:42:40] <StarsyNA> well
[2023-01-04 06:42:42] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> @talrielz and Alien and Predator were there Kappa
[2023-01-04 06:42:47] <StarsyNA> the constant nerfs help with that KEKW

[2023-01-04 06:43:31] <Emp_Nero> @talrielz u cant really put r kelly in the same sentance as international sex trafficker and a rapist cmon now
[2023-01-04 06:43:54] <%talrielz> i just went with well known people that fit the predator definition
[2023-01-04 06:44:00] <%talrielz> it wasnt much more thought out than that
[2023-01-04 06:44:07] <Emp_Nero> bet
[2023-01-04 06:44:16] <StarsyNA> yeah I often play on new accounts cause I enjoy doing F2P to legend challenges and I often get 2-3k dust after nerfs a while in.. I mean it's not enough to buy a really expensive deck but you can always find a tier 1 deck to play if you're smart

[2023-01-04 08:10:12] <!%BlitzFreeman> They were both good but for different reasons
[2023-01-04 08:10:38] <Impbloody> i think cards like righteous defense and cavern dreamer are on their own tier
[2023-01-04 08:10:49] <!%kingcharles__69> i just remember you rating dreamer as the single most powerful card of all time
[2023-01-04 08:11:09] <%+Thehomedemon360> malignant horror is a really good card but cavern dreamer is at least two tiers above it
[2023-01-04 08:11:11] <!%kingcharles__69> and i believe you said it wasnt even remotely close
[2023-01-04 08:11:13] VIEWERS: 615

[2023-01-04 10:27:39] <%$mrfisher101> So I gotta know. Theres this shuffling sound going on in the background, and its pickled me especially when I watch you on YT cuz theres no music so its very prevalent
[2023-01-04 10:27:41] <%Synastar> But when the game is this broken or the meta with DK I can‚Äôt stand to play it

[2023-01-04 10:28:55] <%$mrfisher101> Not annoying me i've always just wondered if it was a sound added on or an IRL sound

[2023-01-04 10:35:52] <Amulet_Of_Quoz> weapon has no attack delay where the 4/3 is ready to attack

[2023-01-04 13:29:51] <@%gesticulate> @Ellyon I think half the chat players had no idea what they were doing LUL
[2023-01-04 13:30:09] <!%Ellyon> @gesticulate I don't know what I'm doing half of the time either
[2023-01-04 13:30:10] <@%gesticulate> I hadn't played for 2 years and I got 3rd
[2023-01-04 13:30:28] <!%Ellyon> the other half I know what I'm doing but don't care, or play on instinct

[2023-01-04 13:31:02] <!%Ellyon> I'm still trying to get 6969, so it's quite often I go full whelps and actually end top 4 anyway
[2023-01-04 13:31:09] <%+deformedpoet> thats what she said
[2023-01-04 13:31:27] <!%Ellyon> not full whelps, I try to get at least 3 golden red whelps, then a kaleg to buff whelps
[2023-01-04 13:31:33] <!%Ellyon> for some reason it sometimes works
[2023-01-04 13:31:57] <!%$JuicyFunSauce> WOAH Double Rainbow....
