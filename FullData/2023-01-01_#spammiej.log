[2023-01-01 16:07:15] <%Ultar1on> Has happened a couple times in norway last year too, a lot of people have been terrible treated for years, so it matters that the state head gives these people something back

[2023-01-01 16:08:12] <%Kriidy> To me, apologising for a time you never existed, makes no sense to me
[2023-01-01 16:08:14] <%nnuhhan> you could argue apologizing is the least. NL benefited economically and could pay back ;)
[2023-01-01 16:08:17] <%NotEnoughSpeed> @CoolCat_Ward maybe let's not "better than" and just accept that both can be wrong/cringe
[2023-01-01 16:08:17] <%kv0th9> so sometimes with apologizing it's just acknowledging the fact that these things happened. Many people of colonizing countries remain unaware of the evils so it's good to acknowledge it.

[2023-01-01 16:10:11] <boris90sirob> To be fair you should be aware of the history your state has. One point of it is apologising. The other (more important) part should be trying to 'undo things'. eg giving things back that were stolen in time of colonialization

[2023-01-01 16:11:52] <%Ultar1on> A good example is Italy, which as far as I know the kids in school don't really get taught about Italys role in ww2, it's literally not spoken about

[2023-01-01 16:12:04] <%nnuhhan> it's also a real problem in terms of political relations with former colonies. NL, UK etc. might have moved on from history but governments of India, Indonesia etc. have not and it's hurting diplomatic relations

[2023-01-01 16:14:10] <%Ultar1on> Well, Italy was fighting on Hitler's side, my impression was that this part of history isn't really covered in Italian education
[2023-01-01 16:14:25] <%$raimundezz> my PoV from a country that was colonized but not directly affected by it, apology and acknowledgement at least will open paths to set everything to the rest, either by some compensation or any needed actions

[2023-01-01 16:15:12] <%nnuhhan> @cornnatron right but it goes beyond personal family history. it's entire countries. if you're the Indian government and UK is responsible for oppression, famine etc. for 100+ years, it does still matter
