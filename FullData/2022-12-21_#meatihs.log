[2022-12-21 21:23:17] <BananaHammockHero> i can see you achieving something like that
[2022-12-21 21:23:36] <Ybretsev> 14+16 = 30

[2022-12-21 21:24:04] <LonebrowXd> unleash fel still goes face
[2022-12-21 21:24:06] <LonebrowXd> Pepega
[2022-12-21 21:24:09] <LonebrowXd> quite the nerf
[2022-12-21 21:24:10] <+lots_of_regret> Do they have a 15 health minion in hand
[2022-12-21 21:24:16] <bzdyo> Its not that strong because your spells cant target enemy KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:24:26] <!%Meteor316> maybe he has 30 turn 5?
[2022-12-21 21:24:28] <Ybretsev> Yeah, killed a priest on T6 earlier with frost DH
[2022-12-21 21:24:30] <!%Meteor316> 6
[2022-12-21 21:24:41] <BananaHammockHero> theyll probably nerf it another 2 times, unless the incompetence kicks in extra hard and then we need that 4th nerf
[2022-12-21 21:24:44] <Kamikaze1_> KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:24:53] <sneackmcgeeks> REKT
[2022-12-21 21:24:56] <Ybretsev> Yeah DK.
[2022-12-21 21:25:01] <Ybretsev> It can highroll too.
[2022-12-21 21:25:13] <Ybretsev> Yeah.

[2022-12-21 21:25:22] <Ybretsev> Shouldn't go face. Would be fairer.
[2022-12-21 21:25:23] <Vengeance_88> Unleash fel not hitting face would hit harder imo
[2022-12-21 21:25:30] <Ybretsev> Fine with a board clear and even the heal.
[2022-12-21 21:25:34] <ArmsOfMichelleObama> They need to bring back Il'gynoth @MeatiHS YEP
[2022-12-21 21:25:35] <+ucdchris1> i dont know if it can kill the opponent reliably if fel cant go face
[2022-12-21 21:25:36] <+lots_of_regret> Unleash fel is the problem card honestly
[2022-12-21 21:26:01] VIEWERS: 224
[2022-12-21 21:26:04] <+ucdchris1> the heal starting on turn 6 means if u force the opponent to go in on turn 5 u force them to make actual decisions
[2022-12-21 21:26:05] <simr_hs> Unleash fel not hitting face deletes the deck, or at least this version imo
[2022-12-21 21:27:11] <JokerFrags> @MeatiHS how do you find dh after nerfs?

[2022-12-21 21:56:29] <Vengeance_88> 30 cuts the secret package except the 2/2
[2022-12-21 21:56:30] <meltingnt> nah can't fit it

[2022-12-21 22:54:55] <meltingnt> i think they didn't hit radiant because they want that deck with the infinite spell to be a thing
[2022-12-21 22:55:12] <Markuzad> what about ads incentive from Twitch? do you like the system? @MeatiHS
[2022-12-21 22:55:30] <ikilledkenny_44> the relic change is slowing this deck down by a full turn basically?  or am i wrong?
[2022-12-21 22:55:34] <!%FenoHS> yes
[2022-12-21 22:55:39] <!%FenoHS> its the only deck that beat all my decks
[2022-12-21 22:55:46] <!%FenoHS> and did the same exact thing every game the same way

[2022-12-21 23:04:12] <%ChrisIsError_> it's a statement of fact
[2022-12-21 23:04:13] <!ChrisTTime> What if you complain about not complaining is it complaining when you don‚Äôt complain tho?
[2022-12-21 23:04:13] <%metaGL> start a poll to decide if it was a complaint
[2022-12-21 23:04:15] <alexmirash> definitely not
[2022-12-21 23:04:16] <+jeffpmerc> Justified complaint
[2022-12-21 23:04:17] <Tarikmo> Complaint definition: a statement that a situation is unsatisfactory or unacceptable.

[2022-12-21 23:04:33] <+merlotmami> Dammit is subjective not objective so it is a complaint
