[2022-12-11 00:00:20] <+JordanU> Like, elevation wise you are still above sealevel cirLaugh
[2022-12-11 00:00:21] <lumustechtips> you can get through heavy aquifers without pumps
[2022-12-11 00:00:23] <Fharli> That is an option, yes - plus, you might find something worthwhile

[2022-12-11 00:00:36] <lumustechtips> just need to drop some walls down
[2022-12-11 00:00:39] <Karneolius> my default embark search includes no aquifers as a condition for a reason lmao

[2022-12-11 00:01:50] <+JordanU> Oh, water is coming down from the aquifers above. Yeah walls/smoothing will fix it
[2022-12-11 00:01:50] <bantuatha> Yeah maybe...
[2022-12-11 00:01:51] <%LeonDragonCat> yeah
[2022-12-11 00:01:52] <%BestyVT> yes, just construct walls to replace the damp ones @Limealicious
[2022-12-11 00:01:54] <Karneolius> it's running down from above
[2022-12-11 00:01:56] <%LeonDragonCat> kinda

[2022-12-11 00:02:30] <%BestyVT> should yeah
[2022-12-11 00:02:31] <Karneolius> also when you replace walls, make sure the corners are done first, water can seep through corners
[2022-12-11 00:02:31] <%FourtyTwo424242> yes

[2022-12-11 00:03:51] <Karneolius> iron, and lignite is coal which you both need for steel
[2022-12-11 00:04:03] <lumustechtips> they can
[2022-12-11 00:04:05] <giromatt> on the bright side, you own the water, tax the use
[2022-12-11 00:04:09] <%LeonDragonCat> they can yeah
[2022-12-11 00:04:12] <+DormantFlame> sometimes they will and sometimes they won't
[2022-12-11 00:04:14] <%thatcrazycrabs> "I'm trying to fix it" famous last words
[2022-12-11 00:04:14] <%LeonDragonCat> its just 1/7 water

[2022-12-11 00:04:58] <+DormantFlame> I've had to deconstruct walls to make them do it
[2022-12-11 00:05:04] <+Zakaluka15> you might have to click on the build and in the pop up hit the resume button
[2022-12-11 00:05:08] <!%Laimubot> he was even more weird if they didnt use bits from that one room in Diamond/Pearl.
[2022-12-11 00:05:10] <+Zakaluka15> if it has suspended
[2022-12-11 00:05:18] <+RaycuSpades> Did you unflood your fortress, or make a new one?

[2022-12-11 00:06:04] <artemis_fowl_second> find the tiles producing the water and slap them
[2022-12-11 00:06:04] <+JordanU> just keep digging and it wont be able to flood faster than it evaporates :D
[2022-12-11 00:06:05] <+luks180> :)

[2022-12-11 00:06:33] <%$peekas0> you'd have to really try for a light aquifer to flood you out
[2022-12-11 00:06:34] <%FieldMedic4077> limesFine but instead of fire the ferret is under water
[2022-12-11 00:06:37] <+JordanU> Speaking of flooding, rev lost his whole storage by digging into a river LUL

[2022-12-11 00:21:41] <+ztmackin> All the religions are randomly generated
[2022-12-11 00:21:46] <+JordantheKitty> taverns need a chest or two as well

[2022-12-11 00:21:51] <+JordanU> I find myself only caring about a dwarf if something weird happens
[2022-12-11 00:21:58] <%+LaNague> its just larger scale i think, like 100+ instead of 10 people
[2022-12-11 00:22:00] <siriywolf> @Justjake274 there are many
[2022-12-11 00:22:02] <%densvenske22> the dwarves need to do something to justify getting noticed
[2022-12-11 00:22:03] <Karneolius> dining hall can technically go without chest but then dwarves are hauling their mugs around
[2022-12-11 00:22:04] <@%Greygull> It tends to be a bit less personal, since DF's max pop is expected more around 150 - 200 people rather than Rimworld's 15 - 20
[2022-12-11 00:22:06] <%ToasterWings> @JordanU this
[2022-12-11 00:22:07] <Bortonium> it seems like you'll always have too many dwarves to REALLY care about any of them
[2022-12-11 00:22:17] <bub_skebulba> when you have over 100 you don't care if one drowns doing something stupid
[2022-12-11 00:22:17] <%BestyVT> Taverns need chests, fancier bedrooms need chests but you don't need to worry about that until you have like 50+ dwarfs I think
[2022-12-11 00:22:17] <+Koopa_Troopa000> how does it work when you wanna attack somewhere?
[2022-12-11 00:22:18] <%+Kippeves> Dwarven Fortress is more based on what they want, Rim-World is about what they need
[2022-12-11 00:22:24] <%bunglinglummox> thankfully it turns out you can be very vague about what counts as a "temple"... I basically put a solid gold statue in a room and called it a day

[2022-12-11 00:27:57] <%densvenske22> can't smooth sand
[2022-12-11 00:27:57] <%FrankRTWiw> It might be.
[2022-12-11 00:27:57] <%+Mango_Marc> Or just place floor
[2022-12-11 00:27:58] <Joa1103> I hate sand
[2022-12-11 00:28:00] <%BestyVT> it's a good long term idea but you don't have to
[2022-12-11 00:28:06] <+JordanU> Long term rock would probably be best for a fort
[2022-12-11 00:28:16] <+Zakaluka15> top layer of sand is a little fragile, things can cause cave ins
[2022-12-11 00:28:18] <Karneolius> it'll be useful when you want to make more valuable living quarters

[2022-12-11 00:28:32] <%BestyVT> oh doormatt said you can engrave constructed floor now so the only downside to constructed bedrooms would be that a big monster can smash through it
[2022-12-11 00:28:36] <Valhallan597> You also don't need individual rooms. Those are better spent on nobility.
[2022-12-11 00:28:39] <Karneolius> sand can't be smoothed, and thus not engraved

[2022-12-11 00:29:09] <%k0zand> bedrooms are good, but people usually make 3x1 rooms
[2022-12-11 00:29:11] <ThoseHazyDays> It does make them happier to have their own room
[2022-12-11 00:29:13] <MisterChippy> its absolutely worth it
[2022-12-11 00:29:13] <Karneolius> bedrooms lead to good thoughts, dormitories lead to a negative thought

[2022-12-11 00:29:22] <+JordanU> What about under that cirISee
[2022-12-11 00:29:29] <Joa1103> each dwarf should get their own 10x10 room really
[2022-12-11 00:29:29] <ThoseHazyDays> they do get happier the nicer their rooms are
[2022-12-11 00:29:31] <LaSuperPasteque> @CybersynEnZo yes

[2022-12-11 00:29:47] <%+TheWingMan27> Building living areas in stone is good, because you can smooth, and then engrave it. Which is a huge quality boost and makes them a lot happier.

[2022-12-11 01:33:48] <%+TheWingMan27> IMO, you should just have two-ish dwarves assigned to smoothing. Once they are done, they will be insanely good engravers, and almost all of their engravings will be masterpieces.

[2022-12-11 01:34:22] <madain_sari> you need an anvil to make a forge too :)

[2022-12-11 01:36:07] <LaSuperPasteque> some ores can give you different metals (ex 80% chance of lead and 20% of silver)

[2022-12-11 20:58:56] <%LeonDragonCat> for the drincc
[2022-12-11 20:58:56] <%orbitaltuna> i usually put lots of engravings in dinning and meeting places

[2022-12-11 20:59:32] <%LeonDragonCat> dining hall its for the dwarves, taberns will have visitors
[2022-12-11 20:59:33] <%zman12380> One is mainly eat, the other is get drunk and get performers/visitors

[2022-12-11 21:05:15] <ululator> I think the thing with plump helmets is, you only get spawns when it gets brewed or eaten directly, but dwarves prefer real meals. so if you have real meals and brew with other things you never get more spawns I think

[2022-12-11 21:32:41] <tolliamlew> you may consider digging your base slightly deeper so that you're in stone, so later on you can smooth it out and engrave it
[2022-12-11 21:32:41] <+Judexe> they'll just choose whatever, it's basically just costs more of the ingredients, like lame meal takes 2 food, good meal takes 5 foods

[2022-12-11 22:08:09] <stefmorino> Vinny what voice changer are you using, it's really convincing
[2022-12-11 22:08:09] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> I am sufficiently overwhlmed lookin at all this
[2022-12-11 22:08:15] <+drkipp56> Mouse support is a godsend
[2022-12-11 22:08:18] <brrrako> one thing I miss in the steam version is no DFHack or Therapist :(

[2022-12-11 22:08:21] <Jigglyritz> adventure mode is kind of a fever dream though lol
[2022-12-11 22:08:38] <TsunamiAromatic> @brrrako DFHack should be out next month
[2022-12-11 22:08:38] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> I'll stick to stardew valley like a little biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~  this is too much for me methinks

[2022-12-11 23:57:47] <%$peekas0> No Windows
[2022-12-11 23:57:51] <tankstopper> Is this game very CPU intensive?

[2022-12-11 23:57:59] <%JoJo0217> only mac and linux

[2022-12-11 23:58:16] <%+TheWingMan27> You literally can't have elves not hate you. It's deliberately designed to be basically impossible to avoid using a significant amount of wood. So fuck the stupid elves.
[2022-12-11 23:58:17] <%TsunamiAromatic> This game runs pretty well with proton btw
[2022-12-11 23:58:20] <Karneolius> only Linux now 🕶️
