[2022-12-29 03:25:16] <@%+Yawger> The way NFTs are now... its dumb.... however it will replace paper items of value in the future... I.E. your house deed, and vehicle title... etc... stuff will transfer digitally once the GOVT establishes which BlockChain will be on top

[2022-12-29 16:49:38] <+dadon420619> Oh there goes that then lol
[2022-12-29 16:49:46] <+Youngjamaican11> damn I need to get more then haha I literally bought more then I would need before the prices shot up and haven't needed any more üôÉ

[2022-12-29 16:49:51] <+Hazz526> Weird that it shows you what it won't buy, but doesn't show what it WILL buy
[2022-12-29 16:49:58] <lilodot> I'm pretty sure it's telling you they can't buy the junkbox because of the items noted that are inside of it
[2022-12-29 16:50:15] <lilodot> So for a trader that you can sell all that junk to the list is shorter
[2022-12-29 16:50:18] <+Youngjamaican11> thank you for letting me know haha@brutxl_

[2022-12-29 20:14:24] <+PwnzaloT_TV> @SKYS0N1C learn maps, have them up on second monitor if possible. dont worry about gear or insurance too much. find a loot path to a few diff extracts that you like and run them ovr n ovr

[2022-12-29 20:15:57] <+PwnzaloT_TV> @SKYS0N1C find land marks.. to be honest the easiest map to learn extracts i think is interchange.. they are all mostly outside the mall and you can orient yourself easily with the signs

[2022-12-29 20:54:57] <$weazle077> me and my friend just stopped player I join the stream and the topic here is the same as way we stoped playing tonight.
[2022-12-29 20:55:12] <+pineappled1ck> @hypeastros Likely when game goes on sale people buy and then sell for cheaper, along with stealing accounts
[2022-12-29 20:55:13] <hypeastros> A lot are resold for like $25
[2022-12-29 20:55:15] <%+Westie1010> Dynamic IPs make IP banning terrible. Hardware bans should deffo be a thing
[2022-12-29 20:55:15] <%+The_QuietRiot> People who cheat should get a fat charge IRL, Make cheating a mandatory 5K Fine and i bet people will stop
[2022-12-29 20:55:35] <memesiss> @DeadeyeJF IP banning does nothing. You just call ur ISP and swap it...needs to be a hardware/mac ban

[2022-12-29 20:55:53] <%+Westie1010> Hardware banning HAS to be combined with a valid communication channel for false positives
[2022-12-29 20:55:55] <%+Westie1010> cause it does happen
[2022-12-29 20:55:57] <%+DJSquashy> @The_QuietRiot  you cant fine people for cheating

[2022-12-29 20:56:03] <+MozerDozerr> There‚Äôs clips of people getting banned and getting another account within 5 minutes
[2022-12-29 20:56:14] <DeadeyeJF> @memesiss well more strict bans instead of just banning profile and allowing them to buy and download more cheats
[2022-12-29 20:56:23] <+pineappled1ck> @Westie1010 This, but also regular bans as well
[2022-12-29 20:56:24] <%+WeaPWNiZedB> lvndmark is a cheater confirmed XD
[2022-12-29 20:56:27] <%+The_QuietRiot> @DJSquashy I know you can't, But you should be able too

[2022-12-29 20:57:15] <%+Westie1010> Issa true, once a cheater always a cheater.
[2022-12-29 20:57:21] <%Wootloops> no company who has "package deals" for their game really actually cares about cheaters lol
[2022-12-29 20:57:40] <+pineappled1ck> I think that statement should only be applied to a game, rather than the whole character/person

[2022-12-29 20:58:08] <+MozerDozerr> They need a camomo in this game
[2022-12-29 20:58:13] <%+Westie1010> @pineappled1ck Depends. Some people don't have the mental to stick through improving at a game.
[2022-12-29 20:58:15] <+SoHOT12> is there a clip chat
[2022-12-29 20:58:18] <Kennyskill> i cheated the shit out of aoe2 and GTA
[2022-12-29 20:58:29] <+yuhtek> I got false banned before, bought a new copy of eod, then accidentally llogged into banned account just to find it unbanned, not sure if that's due to them realizing their mistake or they just unban all accounts in waves
[2022-12-29 20:58:37] <ethen> the usec guy on the loading screen looks just like hutch lol
[2022-12-29 20:58:50] <ghilliedhutv> last night when u played whit sum   agenst dude whit mp5  dubbel  head eyes   felt liek cheater also

[2022-12-29 20:59:02] <+Ced4437352> have you tried hunt showdown ?@HutchMF
[2022-12-29 20:59:03] <+pineappled1ck> @pineappled1ck That is also a fair point, people can also be shitty and just cheaters overall, but some just like to make X game easier overall
[2022-12-29 20:59:08] <+SoHOT12> oh yeah i got 2000 hours in the game ik
[2022-12-29 20:59:09] <%Wootloops> i want to cheat to catch the cheaters
[2022-12-29 20:59:21] <$weazle077> @SoHOT12 you can watch the VoD of the laast 15 min
[2022-12-29 20:59:37] <+browndown83> I found out someone was cheating and he ended up killing a dev and got a instant ban and the dev emailed him and was like why are you cheating
[2022-12-29 20:59:40] <+loksmiff> Yeah it doest make sense
[2022-12-29 20:59:40] <+Yakuzza_Greg> maybe he was a good player too
[2022-12-29 20:59:41] <Kennyskill> @ikky_0 bro, age of empires 2 back in the day, and GTA San Andreas, cheating was fucking fun in those games

[2022-12-29 21:00:19] <%+Westie1010> @Kennyskill is it cheats if the developer adds it ?
[2022-12-29 21:00:22] <Kennyskill> he has the better gaming chair @HutchMF
[2022-12-29 21:00:32] <+MozerDozerr> Even if it was a stream sniper those plays were out there

[2022-12-29 21:02:04] <%+Westie1010> To be fair I think it'd be more effective to have cheater lobbies rather than just banning accounts. Why let them know they're banned so they can just grab another account?
[2022-12-29 21:02:09] <%+Westie1010> Seems more effective to isolate them and not tell em

[2022-12-29 21:43:16] <%catloafjr> just bought the game an am installing. ready to snipe you hutch Kappa
[2022-12-29 21:43:23] <+jaysunnie> can i hop between streams for drops or is the progress individual
[2022-12-29 21:43:25] <%SMURKlO> @dasMEHDI give a bunch of russians all of our phone numbers lol
[2022-12-29 21:43:25] <+Kreamfire> @dasMEHDI BRIAN! hi
[2022-12-29 21:43:28] <+Technical_13> i got my extracts mixed up and almost didnt make it out LUL
[2022-12-29 21:43:28] <%+Westie1010> and maybe a CSGO overwatch kinda system
[2022-12-29 21:43:34] <%+Westie1010> for people who have X amount of hours
[2022-12-29 21:43:38] <+pineappled1ck> @dasMEHDI If they did that, the only way it would work is using the same phone verification as OpenAI, they don't let like any fake phone numbers or google phone numbers allowed either
[2022-12-29 21:43:44] <+PwnzaloT_TV> @Tibbits1234 if they added a kill cam like warthunder where it shows where bullet lands and shit would be cool
[2022-12-29 21:43:54] <Drunkenadvice> How many times has summit shot you this wipe?
[2022-12-29 21:43:58] <+Chaosmourne> @dasMEHDI right cause they totally dont already have ways to get them besides some video game KEKW

[2022-12-29 21:44:26] <Harrlz> @Drunkenadvice none so far
[2022-12-29 21:44:30] <+bugman1> EoD is the only way to play
[2022-12-29 21:44:32] <sharpsprocket> kill cam after the raid over would make it easy to tell without giving teammates info
[2022-12-29 21:44:34] <%+Taco33433> My guess is no cheats - stream sniping maybe
[2022-12-29 21:44:35] <Mmmmm_Stuff> !brops
[2022-12-29 21:44:37] <@%AyeGavMF> chatr if you have chrome or a chrome based browser download the twitch preview extension you cna drag othe streams onto your screen and make a multistream on twitch no matter where u are

[2022-12-29 21:45:00] <bunglesOG> @bugman1 especially when you bought EoD when it came out for way less money lol
[2022-12-29 21:45:01] <sharpsprocket> @War4ire starting gear basically
[2022-12-29 21:45:09] <nickavellii> killcam when you should get insured gear back would be perfect...
[2022-12-29 21:45:21] <unknownandhidden> that was a nice m4 that u picked up

[2022-12-29 22:03:04] <%+Taco33433> Can't make your decisions based on viewers you'll just burn out
[2022-12-29 22:03:37] <I_LCARS_I> Yeah you gotta watch Hutch. He gives the best drops.
[2022-12-29 22:04:03] <ChesterNugget> the twitch ad incentive is based off Average viewers.  It's not advantageous for streamers to Not play their main game.  Lower average means lower ad revenue.
