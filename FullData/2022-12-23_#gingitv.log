[2022-12-23 12:30:16] <bluesector_> @matotheace yes it is how it work. you sum up the hours spend and see where they are. echo was ahead of them before they did go to sleep
[2022-12-23 12:30:27] <+sirledros> you guys are strange. all the guilds have already said they used liquids strats to progress to this point. thats what a day ahead gives them
[2022-12-23 12:30:35] <eavberbwf> xerwo really out dps's liquids lock
[2022-12-23 12:30:39] <matotheace> no team that kills it first is ahead. echo doesnt have 12h after liquid kill to kill it to get world first
[2022-12-23 12:30:50] <+tiggsy> @matotheace this is correct
[2022-12-23 12:30:51] <+scrubishtones25> @bluesector_ that would be "team with less hours spent wins first" and not "race to worlds first"
[2022-12-23 12:30:54] <bluesector_> @sirledros sure, starting 12 hours ealier is such an disadvantage :-D
[2022-12-23 12:30:56] <tommrtns> They will get it today they are just 3hr in today
[2022-12-23 12:30:58] <therocky08> sirledros definitly not xD echo was p3 before them :')

[2022-12-23 13:09:41] <+clicky91> toxic*
[2022-12-23 13:09:44] <%DragneelL9> boss enrages at 10 min, so atm they are not doing enough dps IIRC
[2022-12-23 13:09:52] <%neverlied> good dmg holy
[2022-12-23 13:10:00] <crankshaft55> they had 4 people down going into last phase last time, though
[2022-12-23 13:10:00] <Addry06> @clicky91 they did cause they need to find 19% to kill so they are changing things before p3
[2022-12-23 13:10:02] <+ontotreefor> @DragneelL9 boss doesnt enrage at 10

[2022-12-23 13:10:25] <+instajordy> is there only 1 add phase?
[2022-12-23 13:10:29] <matotheace> liquid got boss to 41.9% after 2nd phase on their best. echo had it 41.4% now. so pretty much the same
[2022-12-23 13:10:29] <xotic87> if think its time to bring the best buff in... the girlfriends with the baseball bat behind the dors waiting coming home for christmas
[2022-12-23 13:10:33] <+Tamsu> 41%aa
[2022-12-23 13:10:36] <+Sazuret> NO THIS IS PATRICK
[2022-12-23 13:10:39] <doc_blue0> 41 Pog
[2022-12-23 13:10:41] <shaenedh> @neverlied they will need like 35%before 2nd itnermssion so they are pretty far off i think

[2022-12-23 13:22:28] <ohelloo> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this.

[2022-12-23 14:19:50] <+yingyang__o> @emulateee I think if they went from 20% to 8% over the course of 3 1/2 hours, they'll kill it before Liquid, Liquid is a good team just becuase they seem to just go for it. They're near the kill becuase they have 80-100 more pulls then the other teams at times.

[2022-12-23 14:21:30] <+yingyang__o> @Thamarian They'll probably down it before Liquid, takes a few pulls for any team to get back into the swing of things after waking up.
[2022-12-23 14:21:37] <Had_A_GF_B4_This> Someone in Liquids team is walking everyone up screaming “ Echo is at 8% “ 🤣

[2022-12-23 14:49:35] <Had_A_GF_B4_This> There’s a secret phase where the boss turns into Gingi and just BLAST the raid and wipes everyone
[2022-12-23 14:49:39] <+thelabwerks> 50 seconds with no floor space to work with? I think they get a secret phase at 10/5

[2022-12-23 14:55:21] <purrzoned> @noobmasterrrrrrrrr69 Someone mentioned that they cannot deal with it for 8% of the bosses health with a floor full of aoe. It is a dps issue in this case. I am sure they can optimize better but that is what it sounds like.

[2022-12-23 14:57:18] <+the_cle_fan> They are averaging just over 1mil dos a sec as a team. For ever minute they can increase their dps by 5%, that will reduce the boss’s health by an additional 3mil. To make up for the 8% difference (about 30mil), they would need a 5% increase in dos for 10 minutes of the fight.

[2022-12-23 15:00:16] <Hikashuri> Yeah the aoe damage ramps, So I guess they need to find more damage early on so they don't reach the ticking part, a bit more gear or more precision will do that

The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh.

[2022-12-23 17:12:02] <eightexclam> 8-10% is a lot of damage to just find after 200 pulls. That’s the difference of swapping out an entire heal for dps

[2022-12-23 17:22:31] <+aka_tpayne> @thoorus99 at this point, they'd just let another reset happen if nobody kills it this lockout. Clearly within kill range
[2022-12-23 17:22:35] <damptt> it's very competitive this time, I believe Echo gets it first but both are being giga ❤️
[2022-12-23 17:22:42] <%Leviokz> this will never be a real "race" until blizzard decides to makes this whole thing on a tournament server where evey team starts even @theGNL

[2022-12-23 17:23:40] <jordann93> good thing they are healing because this boss does a lot of damage. if they werent healing they would probably die.

[2022-12-23 17:24:04] <+yingyang__o> @Leviokz I mean the racing part is everything lmfao. So it's a "race." You race to gear up pre-race, you race through splits, heroic, and then you race to kill raz.

[2022-12-23 17:30:20] <absv> @Arisolo To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Race to world first. The Mechanics is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the mechanics will go over a typical viewer's head.

[2022-12-23 17:49:34] <Ggx_TV> 8% best pull left is still an insane amount of damage left. I swear this boss wont die until next reset. Not sure how you get that much more dps.
[2022-12-23 17:49:36] <Squeakylegs> boss has to be sub 40%
[2022-12-23 17:49:37] <+lusivity_de> LIQUID FOR WF

[2022-12-23 17:49:41] <Squeakylegs> when they enter last phase
[2022-12-23 17:49:42] <juubecci> Liquid will kill it !
[2022-12-23 17:49:44] VIEWERS: 15 572
[2022-12-23 17:49:44] <%+W0nder87> maybe killable but they need to setup everthing perfect
[2022-12-23 17:49:46] <sykorajakku> I guess they will nerf when Liquid starts
[2022-12-23 17:49:49] <%+Veloxoxo> !best
[2022-12-23 17:49:53] <TheButterRoyale> Yeah, they need like 38-39% going in
[2022-12-23 17:49:56] <%+thoorus99> @Breez_oy with half a Gs behind echo and much more pulls and lower % i am not believing
[2022-12-23 17:49:56] <+genji413> secret phase at 5%
[2022-12-23 17:49:57] <%Deathmarkedx> 8% of this boss is like 50m hp
[2022-12-23 17:49:58] <RednebGaming> @ponthastic @gdax cheers guys sry about that hehe
[2022-12-23 17:49:58] <fell42> that could have been it if 5 didnt die to swirlies
[2022-12-23 17:49:59] <jabbeerawr> mehh if they nerf this and liquid kills it
[2022-12-23 17:50:00] <nolkzor> @krycek__ you're not KEKW
[2022-12-23 17:50:05] <awerton> why dont just echo watch liquid how they do it
[2022-12-23 17:50:05] <VanPercy09xd> it ends at 5%, then alextrazsa appears and deletes the boss EZ
[2022-12-23 17:50:05] <+Recklessqt99> echo = WF POV, LIQUID = world 2nd POV KEKW
[2022-12-23 17:50:08] <%driver1> chill guys they kill it in the next pulls
[2022-12-23 17:50:08] <+Rikkerdine> @juubecci ofc they will, world 2. xD
[2022-12-23 17:50:14] <+Navarri> Honestly, think it will have to be 35 maybe 37%
[2022-12-23 17:50:15] <lastinferno1985> blizz is not gonna tough it annymore
[2022-12-23 17:50:21] <TetrixEffect> @Recklessqt99 100% facts
[2022-12-23 17:50:25] <Ggx_TV> @Squeakylegs they wiped at 8% when boss was at 38% going into p3. The boss needs to be around 35-36% plus they need to squeeze a little extra dps out still.
[2022-12-23 17:50:25] <TheButterRoyale> I hope they nerf it right when liquid wakes up, both guilds are literally at the same exact point. <---if they are going to nerf at all
[2022-12-23 17:50:25] <+yingyang__o> @driver1 there's no "chilling" for this close of a WF lmao

[2022-12-23 17:51:05] <%+thoorus99> @TheButterRoyale they wont do that, cause it is so close in Killrange and that would basically give liquid a rollover

[2022-12-23 17:51:47] <TheButterRoyale> @thoorus99 if they did do it, and it was significant enought o guarantee the boss dies from either guild by the time echo stops raiding, it'd be the way to go if they do a nerf of any kind is all I meant.
[2022-12-23 17:51:52] <awerton> when echo quits, luquid wake up and kill it GG
[2022-12-23 17:51:55] <%+Thoreya> on the reset day

[2022-12-23 17:52:46] <fell42> @SepphiNoSkill it was 24 hrs advantage for week 2 reset no?

[2022-12-23 17:53:02] <Ggx_TV> @FlumbyTV No shot. They have went into Phase 3 at sub 40% with everyone alive, popped lust and all CD's and boss only at 8%. I would be shocked if this gets killed before next reset.

[2022-12-23 17:55:03] <H1yaaaa> MonkaS glaubt unironisch, dass sie das Rennen gegen Gingi gewinnen können, einen Mann, der täglich 450 Gramm reines mageres Protein zu sich nimmt, das seine prall gefüllten Muskeln und 200 Milliarden Gehirnneuronen nährt. Der Strom, den dieser Mann durch die perfekte Ausführung seiner Rotation mit 100 % Betriebszeit erzeugt, reicht aus, um die gesamte Echo-Anlage mit Strom zu versorgen. Was hat Liquid? Triller? Bring mich nicht zum Lachen. Ich denke, wir alle wissen, wer das gewinnt.
[2022-12-23 17:55:04] <%Deathmarkedx> tbh i dont think it will get nerfed because its "close" to kill range atm but at the same time the dmg is not there with current ilvl
[2022-12-23 17:55:05] <safo1903> just replace hunter with another boomy

[2022-12-23 17:59:16] <TheButterRoyale> also, called it! there will be a nerf when liquid gets on and it will be a neck to neck race for5 a few hours. Perfection!
[2022-12-23 17:59:23] <+s_thetic_steve> @xmonk7 timing of a nerf is tricky right now with out giving the kill to whoever is on atm
[2022-12-23 17:59:26] <valianya> They'll nerf after RWF ends
[2022-12-23 17:59:28] <+xaistah> @thebutterroyale lmao keep kidding yourself bruh

[2022-12-23 17:59:35] <abilitytogoeven> @Thoreya they didnt say when nerf will be applied, probably in 2 hours when both guilds awake

[2022-12-23 18:00:13] <+xmonk7> @xmonk7 Yeah, but a 5% nerf is only 3.3%, so Echo is still at 5% on boss
[2022-12-23 18:00:20] <lastinferno1985> 'no blue post yet about nerfs inc how do these guys know ?
[2022-12-23 18:00:20] <Sickpix> no need nerf for echo btw
[2022-12-23 18:00:25] <Ponthastic> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 900 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this

[2022-12-23 18:01:00] <abilitytogoeven> @lastinferno1985 they are in a discord with blizzard devs, its only for RWF guilds

[2022-12-23 18:01:08] <eightexclam> 3-5% nerf and the two guilds trading pulls for a few hours before a kill is best case scenario

[2022-12-23 18:01:32] <lastinferno1985> @SepphiNoSkill thanks but not needed to nerf it
[2022-12-23 18:01:42] <baldkap> @eightexclam they don't need a nerf, they wouldn't keep pulling if they knew they needed 1

[2022-12-23 18:01:49] VIEWERS: 13 380
[2022-12-23 18:01:55] <lastinferno1985> or nerf it now before NA wakes up like blizz normaly does when EU sleeps
[2022-12-23 18:01:58] <TheButterRoyale> Imagine accepting a nerf from blizzard while Liquid is asleep. That'd be the most cowardous way to win. :/
[2022-12-23 18:02:00] <abilitytogoeven> blizzard wants it guaranteed over before tomorrow, its obvious why they are doing it
[2022-12-23 18:02:08] <%Deathmarkedx> that would make their best pull a kill
[2022-12-23 18:02:19] <+ritchey_> is that live or people just talking?

[2022-12-23 18:02:30] <Kalatastz> @TheButterRoyale its noon in america, its the perfect time for a nerf for them what are you on about
[2022-12-23 18:02:30] <Exoduc> meh echo need no nerf to wrap this up
[2022-12-23 18:02:32] <Harrason> liquid should've been up by now
[2022-12-23 18:02:35] <abilitytogoeven> @ritchey_ there is no nerf yet, they just said one is happening today
[2022-12-23 18:02:40] <lastinferno1985> nerfs come in at 3am EU time normaly
[2022-12-23 18:02:42] <+aka_tpayne> @baldkap sure they would. I haven't seen a 100% clean pull yet. Maybe once they were doing it 100% clean and hitting enrage, they might stop pulling
[2022-12-23 18:02:50] <+zami_lol> What build playing their evokers ?

[2022-12-23 18:25:18] <%+Blameitonthe1> theres prob no links, prob in the guild/blizz discord
[2022-12-23 18:25:19] <Squeakylegs> Either p2 is longer so they have more time in p3 or p3 is longer
[2022-12-23 18:25:20] <swiftyisthereason> the only thing that makes sense if no hp nerf is that the lightning in last phase fills room slower
[2022-12-23 18:25:29] <The_Real_Imso> @CharlesLoZ Nerf is not always on hp; and top guild get notified by blizzard when nerf occurs (at least it was the case in previous races)
[2022-12-23 18:25:29] <swiftyisthereason> so they have more time before soft enrage

[2022-12-23 18:39:44] <TetrixEffect> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this. @Arrays

The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh.

[2022-12-23 18:49:14] <icarustwo> @the_koci it’s different because this was additional and should have either not been done since it wasn’t needed, or done on reset day with the other nerf to have a fair competitive integrity. Blizzard hates fun.

[2022-12-23 18:53:18] <+herdal20> clowns trying to undermine echo kill? well deserved for echo
[2022-12-23 18:53:19] <%+AloftPanda> 1day headstart used hitting unkillable boss before hotfixes.

[2022-12-23 19:11:17] <+RelaxExo> Echo had better progess. Only P1 Liquid had an advantage. P2 Liquid already copied Echo Strats. There is no doubt Echo was superior this tier. If the nerf didnt hit, the boss would live through reset and it come down to global timers again.
[2022-12-23 19:11:18] <+dawgh> liquid was awake when the nerf hit so it's not really unfair
[2022-12-23 19:11:20] <kirtyalex> true KEKW

[2022-12-23 19:44:12] <Kwiepz> Blizzard really needs to figure things out... nerfing bosses like this while 1 guild is pulling is just a NO NO

[2022-12-23 19:44:34] <+Millwoods> Blizzard nerfed the boss during NA work hours, not sure how that is a negative for the NA GUILD.

[2022-12-23 19:44:58] <%+bailey131983> NA could wait until a day after EU start the next raid. let them "copy" EU strategy, see how it goes

[2022-12-23 19:45:57] <+verybignice> @Bazzzel go watch the whole kill video it was really amazing how well they played
[2022-12-23 19:46:00] <bbeeeef> arcane has execute?
[2022-12-23 19:46:03] <srze94> Max literally said the players are going home tomorrow no matter what. If they don't care, why should Blizzard :D
[2022-12-23 19:46:04] <DonCaldi> NA lost, get a grip next time. overall you lost no matter what
[2022-12-23 19:46:05] <Zawantetsu> when was the last phase nerf ?
[2022-12-23 19:46:07] <Chetroki> @mmsushii 1st intermission was 50% nerf on the ads there was another 5% nerf on the boss health and they have about 100 pulls more than Echo so they should've been in far better position, but once its fair all NA fans will say that its gifted to Echo
[2022-12-23 19:46:09] <+evilconq> @GingiTV u think u had killed it this try without the last nerf? u were far ahead on damage from the 8% wipe werent u?

[2022-12-23 19:46:19] <getlazy> @mysterious_guy as max said himself, there was no good timing for when to nerf
[2022-12-23 19:46:24] <bbeeeef> oh

[2022-12-23 19:46:37] <CiTRiNiTE> as a liquid fan, I think the biggest difference was them putting prio on sleep. Echo fuckin grinded like 2 19 hour days
[2022-12-23 19:46:40] <Moonlity> Good nerf, because you play it for longer meaning you have to still be perfect mechanic-wise, so people saying it was unfair, it really isn't because you still have to play very well, and since US starts 1 day / 1 reset before, it was pretty fair and GG Echo
[2022-12-23 19:46:40] <BobDaUnicorn> @weissarn he didn't leave - he failed his re-trial
[2022-12-23 19:46:40] <godplayertv> NA fans are like Ronaldo's fans . they just cant accept defeat.
[2022-12-23 19:46:40] <arcaniia007> @weissarn  he didnt leave he got removed.
[2022-12-23 19:46:41] <bangorangg> @getlazy I mean that's also not true. Echo Naowh also straight up disagreed with the nerf timing sooooo

[2022-12-23 19:47:48] <krizz2105> EU had one pull on nerfed last phase state. NA has had what now? 5 pulls? And still hasnt killed it. That + the fact that Echo has had almost a 100 less pulls really shows that it didnt matter that they had it nerfed before Liquid
[2022-12-23 19:47:48] <bangorangg> p3 kinda a joke now lol
