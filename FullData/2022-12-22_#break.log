[2022-12-22 13:23:48] <%SmokinDave73> yep
[2022-12-22 13:23:49] <%Devs1976> yes
[2022-12-22 13:23:49] <%ZCrimes> not really
[2022-12-22 13:23:50] <BornLimitless> with mods, yes
[2022-12-22 13:23:50] <%LeftUppy> Start work at the crack of 11! It's so hard.
[2022-12-22 13:23:51] <%+RJACE_> there's a mod

[2022-12-22 13:23:58] <%LiamG> yes, yes, not really
[2022-12-22 13:24:02] <%ZCrimes> no break. l;imited, unless modded
[2022-12-22 13:24:03] <%ZCrimes> no
[2022-12-22 13:24:06] <%+Pneumoniac> You can normally but itâs clunky and you can get invaded
[2022-12-22 13:24:11] <BornLimitless> the mods isnt offical, but its pretty seamless

[2022-12-22 13:24:14] <%+RJACE_> don't think so, I saw excessive profanity using it tho
[2022-12-22 13:24:18] <%SmokinDave73> you can summon her to help you in areas official normal gameplay
[2022-12-22 13:24:18] <%ZCrimes> its buggy and not official and broken because pvp update

[2022-12-22 13:24:43] <+Agitated_Snail> in the base game you can call in people for boss fights like you summon Oleg but they are only for that fight
[2022-12-22 13:24:44] <BornLimitless> oh yeah, the new update probably borked it
[2022-12-22 13:24:48] <%trafgod> it is fun to help others beat a boss that you have already defeated, pretty good exp too

[2022-12-22 20:23:57] <%EnergyCC> saved Pog
[2022-12-22 20:24:00] <%+RJACE_> my only criticism of elden ring is how convoluted some of these quests are
[2022-12-22 20:24:10] <%Pizzasalad> thats how souls games are
[2022-12-22 20:24:10] <%ZCrimes> get her an arm will ya
[2022-12-22 20:24:17] <%zibabadoo> why's the music so unnerving LUL
[2022-12-22 20:24:22] <+MMaRsu> I like that they dont spell the quests out
[2022-12-22 20:24:33] <%zibabadoo> its making me anxious
[2022-12-22 20:24:35] <%zibabadoo> LUL
[2022-12-22 20:24:39] <%GumboMont> He's gonna need to do a deep dive into some VaatyaVIdya lore videos after this. Always blows my my mind how much I miss in Souls games
[2022-12-22 20:24:41] <%pistrencejx> good talisman
[2022-12-22 20:24:43] <%fredboi1> ZCrimes is this chick the Blade ?
[2022-12-22 20:24:43] <+Fibotus> it makes the game even better tbh
[2022-12-22 20:24:46] <%ZCrimes> @zibabadoo this region is Florida on crack, that's why
[2022-12-22 20:24:52] <%ZCrimes> @fredboi1 yeppers
[2022-12-22 20:25:00] <dingus_maximus> I loom that spins hair
[2022-12-22 20:25:04] <bEn_Ja_m1N> breal slowly going insane monkaS
[2022-12-22 20:25:12] <+MMaRsu> Or underground
[2022-12-22 20:25:15] <%yuzofine> underground also ^^
[2022-12-22 20:25:16] <%zibabadoo> i watched a friend of mine play it quite a bit when it was new, its fun to watch but idk if id enjoy playing it
[2022-12-22 20:25:21] <%ZCrimes> i like this change LUL
[2022-12-22 20:25:21] <%fredboi1> @ZCrimes i cannot wait for that fight LUL
[2022-12-22 20:25:22] <%twilezu> yeah you havent been underground yet LUL
[2022-12-22 20:25:29] <%GumboMont> You can play how through the whole game without stopping to farm or level once. That how it's meant to be played
[2022-12-22 20:25:30] <%Azuray> its grindy if you farm runes like a bitch
[2022-12-22 20:25:33] <%+Tomshepmx> anyone got dying light 2 want to coop
[2022-12-22 20:25:36] <%+rubiks_live> new talisman!
[2022-12-22 20:25:36] <+Satannogria> yes its so big..... Kreygasm

[2022-12-22 20:25:45] <%ZCrimes> @fredboi1 well, she's is like related to her, not the chick itself
[2022-12-22 20:25:53] <%zibabadoo> GumboMont really? the whole grinding for gear and levels and shit always bores me
[2022-12-22 20:26:01] <bEn_Ja_m1N> believe me
[2022-12-22 20:26:05] <%+rubiks_live> I forgot what that Talisman is
[2022-12-22 20:26:05] <%fredboi1> imo you have only done the tip of the iceberg so far
[2022-12-22 20:26:08] <%pistrencejx> Godrick's tower is at the end of the long broken bridge in his castle. run inside the main gate of his castle and turn right.
[2022-12-22 20:26:09] <dingus_maximus> Go toward the glowing tree
[2022-12-22 20:26:11] <%zibabadoo> also, i never liked games like dark souls where the bosses were IMPOSSIBLE to kill lol
[2022-12-22 20:26:13] <%Pizzasalad> shrimpmen
[2022-12-22 20:26:17] <+stonewallace21> has he been to sofria river yet?
[2022-12-22 20:26:23] <%ZCrimes> she gives a great talisman, to increase dmg every hit
[2022-12-22 20:26:26] <%fredboi1> @ZCrimes ah ok i see now, Thank you FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-22 20:26:29] <%zibabadoo> games where beating bosses are just learning fighting patterns are ResidentSleeper to me
[2022-12-22 20:26:32] <+MMaRsu> BreaK only got stuck on the first boss a bit
[2022-12-22 20:26:38] <+MMaRsu> After that hes been owning @zibabadoo
[2022-12-22 20:26:39] <%GumboMont> @zibabadoo You never have to stop to farm. You get enough to level where you need to be just from defeaating bosses
[2022-12-22 20:26:42] <%ZCrimes> @zibabadoo it's so much more
[2022-12-22 20:26:42] <+Luffwoto> the enemy character designs are awesome
[2022-12-22 20:26:45] <@%OutbreakBot> If you want to support me you can sub for free using Twitch Prime! See if yours is available below. brkGood
[2022-12-22 20:26:59] <%pistrencejx> see that tall tower
[2022-12-22 20:27:04] <%ZCrimes> x3 maybe
[2022-12-22 20:27:05] <%fredboi1> way bigger
[2022-12-22 20:27:06] <%pistrencejx> demigod's tower
[2022-12-22 20:27:10] <%FDeppy> about half id say
[2022-12-22 20:27:11] <%zibabadoo> brkHmm maybe ill check it out
[2022-12-22 20:27:12] <+remdogOG> you dont need to level at all to beat any of these bosses tbh
[2022-12-22 20:27:17] <%+rubiks_live> you new Talisman might be worth using. maybe
[2022-12-22 20:27:18] <%FragmentShader> it's actually very dense once you get a proper sense for all of it
[2022-12-22 20:27:19] <%Devs1976> its the only map in the game LUL
[2022-12-22 20:27:20] <+MMaRsu> I think you can fit about 10 vikendi's in here
[2022-12-22 20:27:24] <@%OutbreakBot> Save Â£30 off your order with code BULB: http://pcspeciali.st/break
[2022-12-22 20:27:26] <%twilezu> that tower is really cool and has a good boss
[2022-12-22 20:27:30] <+stonewallace21> what's cool is every thing you see is somewhere you will go
[2022-12-22 20:27:36] <DonerStoom> someone worked out all in with the dungeons it's about the same size as Pennsylvania
[2022-12-22 20:27:42] <%+finalclouds> yeah that tower has one of the best OST
[2022-12-22 20:27:43] <+OldManAlduin> elder scolls map is big as well

[2022-12-22 20:27:44] <%Devs1976> not really
[2022-12-22 20:27:47] <%ZCrimes> @FragmentShader yup, i find it get smaller every run LUL
[2022-12-22 20:27:51] <+asm3llyf4rt> Have you played any of the newer assassin's creed games? those maps are enormous now.
[2022-12-22 20:27:55] <%twilezu> thats 5 levels basically
[2022-12-22 20:28:05] <%FragmentShader> @ZCrimes the verticality does tons of work here
[2022-12-22 20:28:11] <%+rubiks_live> over the twin blade talisman, imo
[2022-12-22 20:28:11] <%pistrencejx> the depth and layers of the map is crazy. But total area is just fine, I think like 45 square km sth, not "super" huge
[2022-12-22 20:28:16] <%ZCrimes> i just received the OST on vinyl BigRon
[2022-12-22 20:28:20] <%fredboi1> nope

[2022-12-22 20:28:34] <+MMaRsu> @asm3llyf4rt Yeah but its all empty and filled with boring quests (but I did grind to lvl 52 or something)
