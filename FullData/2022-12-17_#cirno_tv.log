[2022-12-17 00:52:16] <@%^StreamElements> TITS is the Twitch Integrated Throwing System which lets you throw objects at me with subs, bits, or channel points! Here's a list of what things do: Channel points = 15 object thrown, Bits = 1 - 10 objects thrown, Gift subs = 19 objects thrown per 1 gift sub. Bits and Gift Subs push me off the screen

[2022-12-17 22:38:25] <%PUPHEAD> Spoink bounces around on its tail. The shock of its bouncing makes its heart pump. As a result, this Pokémon cannot afford to stop bouncing - if it stops, its heart will stop

[2022-12-17 23:56:54] <%$Lucoa_Best_Dragon> If you're using Wooper for the entire game Cirno, Toxic Spikes would be good because it poisons the Pokemon that gets thrown out, so It's an extra bit of damage for trainers/gyms.
