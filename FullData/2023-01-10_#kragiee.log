[2023-01-10 11:56:09] <%hewliss> You can hire companies to help collect rent and fix damages

[2023-01-10 11:56:38] <theshaggydogpoo> in the uk, you need to live somewhere for 10 years before you can claim squatters rights. So its a lil hard to do lol

[2023-01-10 11:57:03] <AfterLoLs> u can take them to court if in ur landlord contract has it that they must keep the place as first "delivered" if not , they lose their safety deposit to u since u gotta use that for repairs
[2023-01-10 11:57:04] <goatsucc> @kragiee you can give your property to an agent to mange for you then it's their responsibility

[2023-01-10 11:57:32] <rev4n_1738> nah i mean, they take a small cut
[2023-01-10 11:57:38] <%simonczuzu> even using a agency is a lot of work
[2023-01-10 11:57:39] <Pynkato> they can scam you out of your security deposit

[2023-01-10 11:59:34] <All_Black2011> Market demand decides rent price
[2023-01-10 11:59:36] <backpack_ow> Considering i dont have to work because my tenants pay all my bills, its less stressful than having a full time job and i get more free time.  Ive had a few tenants that leave the place trashed, but they end of paying a cleaning fee and i pay a cleaning company to take care of it.
[2023-01-10 11:59:47] <krelit2835> isn't that already happening? the bigger / better house has higher price, no?
[2023-01-10 11:59:53] <squashyee> roxbury nod

[2023-01-10 11:59:57] <iambatoman> Probably depended on the area and then the state of the appartment/house etc
[2023-01-10 12:00:08] <%+matureadult_69420> @krelit2835 location has a big impact
[2023-01-10 12:00:08] <jchosen> like it's controlled & also sky rocketing how is that possible?

[2023-01-10 12:00:37] <krelit2835> in France I believe you can only rent for 1/3 of your net income, so that limits the market as well
[2023-01-10 12:00:39] <backpack_ow> @jchosen u sound like u dont really know how beinng a landlord works
[2023-01-10 12:00:45] <%+matureadult_69420> you can buy a 2 bedroom apartment in south kensington for the same price you can buy a 6 bedroom house in manama bahrain with a pool and isolated with good security

[2023-01-10 12:49:54] <J4A9> npc chat will just recite seagull's takes and play junkrat
[2023-01-10 12:50:01] <%ketaruz> sojourn takes huh PepeLaughington
[2023-01-10 12:50:04] <CallMeGreeny> but then mercy would suck :P
[2023-01-10 12:50:05] <hawks_sa> but from a viewers pov shes a snooze fest.
[2023-01-10 12:50:06] <Teccon> Playing against a good sojurn though is so oppressive. Makes it so unfun to play against. It was like playing against an insanely good doom player @kragiee
[2023-01-10 12:50:13] <%bebex001_> why would they remove mercy???
[2023-01-10 12:50:21] <%Saber_Ramoth> That‚Äôs why I enjoy his sojourn, see where I can position myself better

[2023-01-10 12:51:53] <Juhis_ow> i was playing sojourn(with mercy pocket) and got totally shut down by a genji. Obviously genji nerfs wasnt enough. they should try 25dmg per shuriken next.
[2023-01-10 12:51:55] <%bebex001_> i think soujourn is fine they just need to nerf her insane mobility. they should make her slide cooldwon 8 or 9 seconds imo
[2023-01-10 12:52:00] <%Saber_Ramoth> Orissas scream when she dies is funny imo
[2023-01-10 12:52:01] <saccone1987> she just need some sort of recoil
[2023-01-10 12:52:02] <+lefthumb> give her 25 per clip lol
[2023-01-10 12:52:24] <%sp33dyal> what do you think about her in first beta but if they nerfed her bodyshot dmg @kragiee
[2023-01-10 12:52:26] <%+cheshirelime> They should nerf her body shot damage
[2023-01-10 12:52:28] <%ketaruz> tbh sojourn is pretty high skill but her mobility outclasses other dps
[2023-01-10 12:52:30] <scopedog7> sojourn is how most characters should be, versatile and skill based

[2023-01-10 12:52:55] <DemonDam> You legit shot her in the chest and that was a headshot LUL
[2023-01-10 12:52:55] <%Saber_Ramoth> Or just make her easier to hit, she seems hard to hit imo when I play against a sojourn

[2023-01-10 12:55:12] <%sp33dyal> Both require bodyshot around same distance
[2023-01-10 12:55:15] <danefive> @Juhis_ow I guess I walked into that one LUL
[2023-01-10 12:55:17] <%grudell> everything is more enjoyable than dying to hook YEP
[2023-01-10 12:55:20] <%sp33dyal> and sojourn gets her right click faster
[2023-01-10 12:55:22] <!%Mikeverv> @tm_901 kragie7
[2023-01-10 12:55:27] <CuddlePrime> I mean true, but that's the worst feeling in the game xD
[2023-01-10 12:55:30] <%sp33dyal> so i'd rather die to hog and let him without a hook for 7 seconds
[2023-01-10 12:55:33] <Teccon> Skill is a strong word
[2023-01-10 12:55:35] <CuddlePrime> But it's easily the 2nd worst
[2023-01-10 12:55:36] <Tsuniko> did they add aim assist to pc?
[2023-01-10 12:55:44] <+lefthumb> nah ill take the hook. that just means i was caught lacking
[2023-01-10 12:55:45] <%sp33dyal> then a sojourn who gets right click within a second
[2023-01-10 12:55:46] <GioS7N> I mean honestly anything is better than a hog hook

[2023-01-10 13:10:20] <ViltsuH1> weight loss is not calories in and calories out. Your body doesnt count calories. Calories just tells the thermic effect of the food, has nothing to do with weight loss or gain. Weight is all about hormonal balance, like insulin and metabolic hormones tht are regulated by your thyroid.

[2023-01-10 13:14:09] <Teccon> @Tuppelura Mind controls the body. Plus depression can cause physiological changes on the body which make it harder to maintain healthy habits
[2023-01-10 13:14:09] <+Shrubx> Ive found that looking after my physical health helped out with my mental health.  its a two-way street imo
[2023-01-10 13:14:14] <ViltsuH1> yes but what you eat changes your hormonal balance. if you have high insulin all the time because of snacking, you cant lose weight. Insulin blocks fat burning. i eat lots of healthy food and definitely get more than my daily 2000 kcal. My weight went to optimal weight in 1 year.
[2023-01-10 13:14:25] <danefive> I eat to live life, not live life to eat
[2023-01-10 13:14:26] <thodoris30> ur insta profile is lame. u could be a model but u chose lame
[2023-01-10 13:14:32] <%thraaace> i lost almost 10kg on a diet of mostly mcdonalds. i just cut kcals.

[2023-01-10 13:14:36] <%thraaace> took about a year though
[2023-01-10 13:14:43] <Tuppelura> Food is like about 80% of weightloss? I√¶ve cut sown on sugar and I try to drink enough water :)
[2023-01-10 13:14:43] <Teccon> You will not be healthy. But you will loose weight KEKW
[2023-01-10 13:14:44] <zaidmal> calorie deficit is the only thing that matters
[2023-01-10 13:14:45] <tuexe> calorie deficit is losing weight calorie surplus is gaining weight that simple

[2023-01-10 13:15:27] <theshaggydogpoo> he kinda has a point. Some dietary restrictions like avoiding carbs or extended fasting effect insulin and hormonal levels which have shown effects on weight. Its just very complicated

[2023-01-10 13:16:54] <theshaggydogpoo> Like if its in vs out, you can eat literally nothing for 2 days and actualyl gain weight as your body goes into starvation mode and stores as much fat for survival as possible

[2023-01-10 13:17:12] <tempsanot> I think hormonal changes do affect it to a degree but it is such a little amount compared to just breaking it down to calories in and calories out

[2023-01-10 13:17:41] <billybalfour> Losing weight is not the same as healthily losing FAT whilst maintaining or increasing muscle. I think chat is having a semantics debate.
[2023-01-10 13:17:43] <ViltsuH1> your body doesn "suck in" calories that you. its not that simple

[2023-01-10 13:26:30] <billybalfour> @Tuppelura eat lots of fermented foods to improve your gut biome, the chemicals it produces have a direct effect on you serotonin etc.
[2023-01-10 13:26:38] <theshaggydogpoo> There absolutely is. Starviung kids in africa are often reported gaining weight for a while as your body turns all its resources into fat and you dont move. its vvery very well documented..
[2023-01-10 13:26:43] <Tuppelura> Yeah the fasting diet is not reccomended
[2023-01-10 13:26:45] <theshaggydogpoo> someone google lol i cant do this all for you

[2023-01-10 14:18:48] <%+ZefiTV> @tm_901 so the incentive to play a role is for it to be broken
[2023-01-10 14:18:51] <%+ZefiTV> i get it

[2023-01-10 14:20:09] <t3tsu1> dps can do tank and tanks can rarely do dpsthe same way
[2023-01-10 14:20:09] <SamHPL_> Most people are annoyed by one rank or another, but not the role itself, I don't think blizzard is nerfing the role as a whole any time soon
[2023-01-10 14:20:09] <%+tm_901> @ZefiTV im saying if theyre not a threat, how will they create space, people would just ignore them

[2023-01-10 14:20:27] <AutomatonCentral> @kragiee I think the point you're making is that it's the exception vs the norm. Most tank players aren't great DPS.
