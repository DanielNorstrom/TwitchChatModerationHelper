[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <%OkYennefer> also hello chat nemeHey
[2022-12-07 17:34:07] <Marxo2> Yeah items became dead broken now
[2022-12-07 17:34:09] <%+dagzyY> Nem I had a thought about zero. since her q is an auto attack but technically an ability so would essence reaver kinda be broken on her?
[2022-12-07 17:34:11] <mentalfishaa> yeah Riot wants a fast pace game
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <Marxo2> It's more about the items and less about the champions
[2022-12-07 17:34:16] <%+dagzyY> zeri *
[2022-12-07 17:34:16] <%vladcranga> true abilities are back up so fast u dont even have time to punish once they get cdr

[2022-12-07 17:34:37] <jammy_pineapple> it's pretty ridiculous it was crazy coming from dota last season basically every hero has every basic ability on less than 10s cooldown

[2022-12-07 17:34:40] <Mud5276> Lucidity boots have needed a nerf for 2 seasons @lol_nemesis
[2022-12-07 17:34:41] <M0rtemx> Ezreal is literally URF at this point

[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <Xeigul> It was worse before when everyone was going for 40% CDR rush and ability spam very early, now with AH it takes longer to have the same/more
[2022-12-07 17:34:51] <Appu_96> I got you @pyoa_

[2022-12-07 17:35:11] <saliaamara> every ad item for bruiser gives 20 30 haste
[2022-12-07 17:35:19] <sprotfruit> @dagzyy it’s good for earlier spike
[2022-12-07 17:35:26] <Cmj0505> is syndra still good after patch
[2022-12-07 17:35:30] <Mud5276> Lucidity boots make all the champs with spammable cd’s turbo broken
[2022-12-07 17:35:34] <+Shepdogg77> Idk I dont mind galeforce because of how long the cd is
[2022-12-07 17:35:38] <DemyxTheNobody> @dagzyy it works, but her base ad is intentionally super low so it’s not like broken, just good
[2022-12-07 17:35:38] <+miniballi> which is the buuld from zeri?
[2022-12-07 17:35:39] <Xeigul> Yeah but it's a trade-off, you lose damage if you're building Galeforce or Everfrost
[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <Xeigul> Now you have a choice
[2022-12-07 17:35:50] <%+Alveneb> remember that thing Baus said about "they need to rework older champs due to new mechanics"? I think they are trying to add these mechanis through items, but this is BAD
[2022-12-07 17:35:54] <lol_END1> riven on full build consistently gets 55%cdr in a normal build, without shojin, urf is 75%cdr btw

[2022-12-07 17:36:08] <@^Nightbot> Check Latest Video: https://youtu.be/da1rMBURBB0
[2022-12-07 17:36:15] <Ereditto> without mobility items, you'd notice a lot more the difference between old and new champs, but that's a different problem now
[2022-12-07 17:36:28] <%OkYennefer> true talon builds cdr and he has r every 20 seconds
[2022-12-07 17:36:30] <!%Nimlaya> Life
[2022-12-07 17:36:34] <splitz1750> can i trust you?
[2022-12-07 17:36:39] <%+dagzyY> @demyxthenobody ah okay just not tried her. I just thought it could be kinda broken on her late game though once she has items...
[2022-12-07 17:36:41] <Xeigul> Galeforce is a little more bursty but Kraken gives way more DPS
[2022-12-07 17:36:42] <Mud5276> @lol_nemesis genuinely just think lucidity boots needs to be toned down. Is turbo breaks so many champs
[2022-12-07 17:36:48] <%+MoonKnight_cr> At least they took the dash from stridebreaker
[2022-12-07 17:37:06] <@^Nightbot> Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Nemesis_lol/videos
[2022-12-07 17:37:27] <Mud5276> Vex is perfect example
[2022-12-07 17:37:49] <sprotfruit> Ksante was a decent release
[2022-12-07 17:37:51] <Blitz76> Old Stridebreaker Aware
[2022-12-07 17:37:56] <splitz1750> I think Ksante is peak display of how a new champ has too much in the kit.. The guy just dashes every second

[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <Cmj0505> is syndra still meta after patch?
[2022-12-07 17:38:11] <SUPREMEIRL1> But like, lee sin is an old champion right? and he is so fun to play, i dont get it why new champs needs to bee fucking insane
[2022-12-07 17:38:14] <Xeigul> Xerath and Ziggs being viable/meta was making the game terrible to play though
[2022-12-07 17:38:14] <iTsBlazeD> idk why riot doesn't do small buff mages, they literally dont even try anything at all
[2022-12-07 17:38:20] <+gods_nr3> old ryze sajj
[2022-12-07 17:38:22] <김치버거1 (ilc1692)> sup is chovy
[2022-12-07 17:38:24] <pyoa_> Annie: throws a fireball
[2022-12-07 17:38:33] <ee1034> old aatrox PepeHands
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <upheyah> is it as simple as buffing outdated champs?
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <Ereditto> riot is prolly waiting for DotA3 so they can copy a new MOBA :/
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <MadTT_> Aatrox rework never forget
[2022-12-07 17:38:42] <%JDsCode> urgot, warwick, voli
[2022-12-07 17:38:42] <Kikuhiko21> @SUPREMEIRL1 lee sin was completely overloaded and broken when he came out compared to other champs
[2022-12-07 17:38:47] <%+hexxic_> what about nerfing cdr?
[2022-12-07 17:38:50] <dmpay222> well they reworked my ap tristana
[2022-12-07 17:38:52] <김치버거1 (ilc1692)> im watching his live
[2022-12-07 17:39:05] <splitz1750> chovy does play senna sup Susge
[2022-12-07 17:39:06] <+brendyTRON> Did they patch jak and hydra yet?
[2022-12-07 17:39:07] <Lynx__oce> is syndra bad  now with the nerfs? @lol_nemesis
[2022-12-07 17:39:10] <%+hexxic_> so they get dashes less
[2022-12-07 17:39:12] <bulaneeel> where is chovy streaming?
[2022-12-07 17:39:14] <그렘린1201 (gremlin1201)> yup can confirm that is indeed chovy

[2022-12-07 17:39:19] <그렘린1201 (gremlin1201)> FUN FUN
[2022-12-07 17:39:27] <Xeigul> I have nightmares thinking about the old Xerath/Ziggs meta where all people did was waveclearing and nothing else for 40 min
[2022-12-07 17:39:28] <%+catge_meow> it def doesnt
[2022-12-07 17:39:31] <+Shepdogg77> no because people in low elo cant dodge skillshots
[2022-12-07 17:39:37] <Mud5276> @lol_nemesis think lucidity boots are one of greatest offenders right now. For how cheap this item is. It breaks so many champs
[2022-12-07 17:39:42] <f4llada> silver, my ziggs is absolutely smurfing
[2022-12-07 17:39:52] <filorin> why? even in gold people know to buy maw
[2022-12-07 17:39:54] <%grimgrimw> seems like him, chovy uses to play senna supp
[2022-12-07 17:39:55] <saudiherohd> whats mages problem?

[2022-12-07 17:40:07] <%+hexxic_> i mean you give me sylas e with 3 second cooldown im hitting it every time in low elo
[2022-12-07 17:40:10] <iTsBlazeD> games are too quick for mages
[2022-12-07 17:40:13] <Belko2k> it is chovy
