[2022-12-07 00:10:56] <kuruki1998> they give mercy 5 more bullet and swap weapon more faster though battle mercy time @grimstab77
[2022-12-07 00:10:59] <+pyromana192> Brig can still be very good

[2022-12-07 00:12:25] <Tasogare_Seibei> oh, first saw this map in OW2, still didnt play after update
[2022-12-07 00:12:27] <%+Puppychu> @Grimstab77 did they really do that as a buff? my god
[2022-12-07 00:12:43] <@%Grimstab77> Gold players got demoted to silver so you're playing with diam players
[2022-12-07 00:12:46] <Tasogare_Seibei> miss this map from ow1
[2022-12-07 00:12:49] <kuruki1998> some support maim getting rage when they heard support "buff" though
[2022-12-07 00:12:56] <%+Puppychu> can't they just give us secondary fire or something on mercy to shoot from her staff like every single freaking support hero that doesn't need to swap weapon :s

[2022-12-07 00:15:42] <@%zyron999> Probably under performing at high level play
[2022-12-07 00:15:58] <@%zyron999> But he gets turret mode 2 seconds faster now
[2022-12-07 00:16:19] <+pyromana192> bastion ult got sped up and can go mobile turret faster
[2022-12-07 00:16:37] <Tasogare_Seibei> after agressive Brig play, when I swap to Mercy, I always play still aggressive, hunting Pharah, Widow and other supports
[2022-12-07 00:16:40] <@%Grimstab77> junker queen got the exact buff I suggested
[2022-12-07 00:16:43] <@%zyron999> I liked the symm changes too

[2022-12-07 00:17:36] <@%zyron999> They also increased her hit boxes
[2022-12-07 00:17:44] <@%Grimstab77> Well, if you remember I played genji with Nali' after genji nerf, and I destroyed the enemy team so hard, I told them they should nerf genji more

[2022-12-07 00:30:49] <@%Grimstab77> they didn't change her dmg because of falloff bug
[2022-12-07 00:30:52] <@%zyron999> @Grimstab77 Because in OW2 her damage fall off was bugged
[2022-12-07 00:31:12] <@%Grimstab77> it was bugged only after mid season patch

[2022-12-07 15:39:02] <AtlantisPrince> I'm a bit passionate about this, but kson is very dear to me. Coco was the first Japanese hololife talent I watched, and after her graduation I kept watching kson, and because of her I got into Gunpla and Gundam as a whole. VShojo is absolutely perfect for her. VShojo is no agency. VShojo is a family.

[2022-12-07 19:53:18] <%InsaneBrain247> Sometimes I love the idea of raising a kid, but I keep getting fits of self doubt over whether or not I'd be a good father.

[2022-12-07 19:53:48] <thefamily010206> i have been like that before she was pushing it but i just left
[2022-12-07 19:54:20] <@%Grimstab77> I think, I'm in a pretty bad situation. But making a kid now, would make me so happy that it would carry my mood and help me getting out of my current situation.
