[2022-12-29 11:18:44] <Osaroki> ( the anti cheat they use )
[2022-12-29 11:18:48] <RunicEchoes> if you close it you have to restart pc before you can play

[2022-12-29 11:20:25] <jonfaa> Just saw a swedish documentary where they changed the code on a keyboard to implement a cheat. They tested the keyboard on CSGO PGL major computers, and it worked. Imagine pro-players cheating on LAN.

[2022-12-29 13:17:57] <electrified1337> and now it becomes a 50% tracer puilse bomb which is almost impossible to attach for me

[2022-12-29 16:30:43] <OneNippleMan> too many tanks for only one player to chose, they should release supports 3 to 1 ratio
[2022-12-29 16:30:46] <+KingQuet90> They already confirmed it’s going to be just supports and tank until 2024 at least to even out the roster
[2022-12-29 16:30:46] <%deadwud> You already have 17 DPS. Tank and support need to catch up.
[2022-12-29 16:30:49] <+iiiRexOverwatchiii> how you know all this?
[2022-12-29 16:30:57] <%Rxenos> i don't think it's considered a release until it hits the live patch

[2022-12-29 16:31:01] <moo_cao> they said next hero is support.
[2022-12-29 16:31:11] <%Rxenos> support and tank need like 10 heros before another dps

[2022-12-29 17:02:41] <veelopa> oh
[2022-12-29 17:02:56] <+rubstergutt> if its included in the price when you order online its cool, but might be an issue if its a seperate bill you get like in norway
[2022-12-29 17:03:07] <tobigcb547> @local_blixt watch killfeed active, fall back when you lose teammembers
[2022-12-29 17:03:11] <drdeeeznuts> VAT is aas

[2022-12-29 17:03:17] <veelopa> overwatch is better then cod for me less toxic and don't have spend so much bloody money
[2022-12-29 17:03:20] <+andygrar> import tax
[2022-12-29 17:03:20] <AbieCherry> probably customs
[2022-12-29 17:03:24] <TheKiki7> yeah cause prices in US dont have VAT added to the price and you probably had to pay customs fee
[2022-12-29 17:03:28] <TheKiki7> or import tax
[2022-12-29 17:03:32] <+ATAC2OOO> ^
[2022-12-29 17:03:38] <+rubstergutt> i think steam ships its products from EU though, so it shouldnt be a problem. but if its from the us idk
[2022-12-29 17:03:42] <reeeddddsaaa> the new tank is good
[2022-12-29 17:03:43] <+andygrar> plus the US doesn't include their tax in their asking price. it's kinda stupid
[2022-12-29 17:03:46] <reeeddddsaaa> ?
[2022-12-29 17:03:54] <Nroak> Can Genji deflect Sojourn's Laser ?

[2022-12-29 17:04:39] VIEWERS: 4 703
[2022-12-29 17:04:39] <TheKiki7> yeah its ass
[2022-12-29 17:04:55] <GracefulCamel> china usually have free shipping
[2022-12-29 17:04:59] <AbieCherry> @kragiee you pay vat + customs from the us. From EU you just pay vat in the price since there's no import cost cause of economic trade agreement Nerdge
[2022-12-29 17:05:09] <!%$CaseyAstarte> kragieP kragieP kragieP kragieP kragieP kragieP
[2022-12-29 17:05:13] <casanovac12> it is, same strategy is used in Norway
[2022-12-29 17:05:22] <+TeresMajor> Its basically a trade agreement within the EU countries. EU could theoretically make a similar agreement with the US
[2022-12-29 17:05:24] <casanovac12> especially for things outside EU
[2022-12-29 17:05:24] <disKreet808> SojournWatch
