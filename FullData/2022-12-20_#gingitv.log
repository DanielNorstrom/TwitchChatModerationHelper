[2022-12-20 09:33:43] <DarkTakaEMS> some Mage players here? im wondering if its worth to cast surge bigpump in the opener without Harmony stacks as gingi is doing. Stacking harmony on the other side costs a lot mana which remains in reduced surge dmg. does someone know the maths?

[2022-12-20 09:37:27] <widdlewage> in fight is insane. seeing liquid have almost there entire rid on one platform in the intermission and only just making the dps check. Let alone splitting to 2 platforms.

[2022-12-20 09:38:12] <+Skyttew0w> Funny thing is that this is probably the easiest phase
[2022-12-20 09:38:13] <+Tombelune> @darktakaems Harmony stacks are for arcane barrage right ? then as u arcane surge full mana right before touch of the Magi u're building your Harmony stacks during TotM and land your boosted barrage right before it ends. So worth it, even tho maybe building stacks before lets u boost 2 barrages during TofM
[2022-12-20 09:38:21] <furkiii1337> Imagine echo had as much pulls as liquid

[2022-12-20 09:53:10] <JakobEll> yeah you keep the momentum even if you blink. So you have to blink twice and alter time
[2022-12-20 09:53:20] <%xavipm98_> gingi the plater profile is updated?
[2022-12-20 09:53:35] <bcrosala> i have no sound out of blue is it only me??
[2022-12-20 09:53:36] <+matching_towels> But how does more ilvl help in p1, is it skill / mechanics?
[2022-12-20 09:53:54] <morghuliz> more dmg= faster transition
[2022-12-20 09:53:58] <morghuliz> less pushback

[2022-12-20 10:47:45] <%+flygarn92> @WVLQ well i admit what you say 110% but tbf echo is prob playing those rogues specs for a reason not becous someone enjoy the other more i mean they leveling 6-9 diffrent chars to midmax the gear so why not specs aswell?   but i agree with you for sure always play for fun but for them its their kindoff jobb  ^^

[2022-12-20 10:50:43] <gachi93> are there any mentioned hotfixes?
[2022-12-20 10:50:45] <JakobEll> I think they know the boss is unkillable at the moment, but there's not really anything else to do beside training the mechanics. When they get better gear after reset it'll be like taking off the weighted training gear
[2022-12-20 10:50:49] <+Haevendyl> What is hard in this encounter ? Mechanics in first phase look not that hard but maybe the damage output is too strong for the amount of heal required ?
[2022-12-20 10:50:50] <Saayn1> Whats Limits progress at this point?

[2022-12-20 10:53:28] <widdlewage> the boss transitions at 65%. Why both guilds are at the same best. Getting past the intermission seems to be a gear issue as they dont have enough dps or health.

[2022-12-20 11:15:51] <TetrixEffect> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this.
[2022-12-20 11:15:56] <+faaalz> liquid will have a 9 hour headstart they could potentially steal the win

[2022-12-20 11:49:55] <Zantro> this wyvern is unkillable before the reset
[2022-12-20 11:49:59] <%+RedWestBE> I do not understand the decision to continue prog this boss now. It seems pretty obvious that the boss is far from being killable before the reset. Surely a kill at the end of week 2 ?
[2022-12-20 11:49:59] <oreo_mintx> @katana_rider doubtful
[2022-12-20 11:50:01] <+elmetor11> @Xnolitz its reset day lets put 2 and 2 together instead of adding 12 periods
[2022-12-20 11:50:02] <Xnolitz> they theen need to know the fight more, before doing HC splits again

[2022-12-20 11:56:27] <+turbul4nc3> the push back mechanic feels like its just put in for no reason if the only way to do a mechanic is having 3 binks and an alter time or block what's the point lol wheres the counterplay?

[2022-12-20 12:13:06] <Diggodyr> @sneakynoob123 liquid got far in it
[2022-12-20 12:13:06] <Nastiluv> This boss is not dying for Christmas if they dont nerf it
[2022-12-20 12:13:09] <csgolnd> @JaCait going to be nerfed. :)
[2022-12-20 12:13:10] <Ationi> Can the bombs be used against the other two enemy targets?
[2022-12-20 12:13:10] <dethbybunnies> @Tabletopdancer mythic isnt for casuals thats why there is lfr
[2022-12-20 12:13:14] <%+Quagster> @GingiTV have you tested if breath does dmg to adds
[2022-12-20 12:13:18] <+Tabletopdancer> Shaman lifelink totem needed there ;)
[2022-12-20 12:13:27] <%DoNutCare286> @areyoudrunkorwhat low on IL? average 406 or something isnt low
[2022-12-20 12:13:31] <Kranium007> They shouldn't nerf the boss just for RWF
[2022-12-20 12:13:54] <JaCait> @csgolnd tbh I want to kill this boss without nerfs, more fun
[2022-12-20 12:13:55] <+Tabletopdancer> @dethbybunnies I think that any class should be able to complete all content not class locked in the game 🤷‍♀️
[2022-12-20 12:13:58] <Alexation> @DoNutCare286 yes it is

[2022-12-20 12:14:08] <eliass0n_lol> @Kranium007 yeah they should, do you think your average CE guilds will clear it if they dont?
[2022-12-20 12:14:14] <eliass0n_lol> they have no chance in hell even with 420 ilvl lmao
[2022-12-20 12:14:15] <csgolnd> @JaCait so they need to spare all their defensives etc for that phase? xD
[2022-12-20 12:14:25] <sp00kp> @Tabletopdancer all classes can do this boss
[2022-12-20 12:14:26] <7he_unborn> " you can use warlock gateway for example" no sh.. Sherlock 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-12-20 12:14:40] <IKneelWithKaep7> @DoNutCare286 for this mythic boss is it apparently
[2022-12-20 12:14:44] <%Didrinator> @Tabletopdancer All classes can finish mythic, it goes on player/group skill over class further out in the expansion.
[2022-12-20 12:14:55] <%Didrinator> Always been that way
[2022-12-20 12:14:57] <dethbybunnies> @Tabletopdancer there is no class that is locked out of any content thats just in your head
[2022-12-20 12:15:08] <+Tabletopdancer> @sp00kp Can you explain how to get around the knockback? I have not played in a bit

[2022-12-20 12:15:23] <Zantro> i doubt they can reach phase 3 before the reset
[2022-12-20 12:15:25] <sp00kp> @Tabletopdancer by using movement abilities, its pretty straight forward
[2022-12-20 12:15:29] <JaCait> @csgolnd they are 405 ilvl average, after 2/3 resets it will be higher and easier lol
[2022-12-20 12:15:36] <+SLJDHL_> @Tabletopdancer then why am I not allowed to tank any m+ on my mage??
[2022-12-20 12:15:44] <csgolnd> @JaCait u must be trolling xD
[2022-12-20 12:15:58] <Kranium007> Then nerf it later. Not for RWF. Nobody asked anyone to play 16hours a day to kill the boss.
[2022-12-20 12:15:58] <+Tabletopdancer> It looks like 3 dashes needed though. How would a class without much movement do it?

[2022-12-20 12:16:20] <SolitaryVision> @Tabletopdancer on non-mythic there is a boss mechanic that helps
[2022-12-20 12:16:25] <Diggodyr> @csgolnd what you mean why would he troll?
[2022-12-20 12:16:29] <sp00kp> @Tabletopdancer liquid uses two death knights, and dracthyr can pick up allies
[2022-12-20 12:16:29] <%Didrinator> @Tabletopdancer That's where your group matters. Priest grip, warlock gate etc
[2022-12-20 12:16:29] <gachi93> boomkin out of sync lol
[2022-12-20 12:16:32] <Diggodyr> about what
[2022-12-20 12:16:34] <%+mr_b85> @twoface9898 that class, that you can play bether :D
[2022-12-20 12:16:48] <+Tabletopdancer> @didrinator Ty for explaining
[2022-12-20 12:16:48] <+ToAndFrom> Ok seriously dumb question but why not dump the static field directly behind the melee group rather than the edges?
[2022-12-20 12:16:57] <Squeakylegs> wtf is happening with this boss, 114 pulls cant get past 65

[2022-12-20 12:17:29] <Kranium007> @toandfrom The static damage to raid depends on distance

[2022-12-20 12:18:20] <Ationi> At 65% the phase 1 ends and boss is untargetable until mext part is solved.
[2022-12-20 12:18:20] <sp00kp> which is why both liquid and echo are 65%

[2022-12-20 13:54:45] <+bigdoor89> I'm guessing both guilds are gonna do a re-clear for the gears
[2022-12-20 13:55:11] <%maddershunt> yeah by looks and some re splits to gear other toons
[2022-12-20 13:55:13] <+FeebaSmash> @chag_23 yeah they are asking how far into intermission bud
[2022-12-20 13:55:34] <YuriyMeln> So while blizz is sleeping no nerfs inc? And right after reset they'll do it which will be good for liquid?
[2022-12-20 13:55:40] <Kylatex> is funny boss gingi? or sucks? :P

[2022-12-20 14:56:44] <+kashew201> probably once everyone gets more gear
[2022-12-20 14:56:51] <+MellunXD> @Frangen89 Probably. But we have yet to see the other phases so who the hell knows

[2022-12-20 18:52:46] <snorrow92> these echo ads only get shown during lunch and dinner time, get over it
[2022-12-20 18:52:49] <@%+niclasvjensen> People have complained about twitch adds the entire race.

[2022-12-20 18:53:22] <abilitytogoeven> the event is in partnership with twitch they are spamming ads on purpose KEKW
[2022-12-20 18:53:24] <xotic87> cry more about ad's wtf...
[2022-12-20 18:53:29] <+Austere_1> i mean if you want to have a race at all you need ads from sponsors

[2022-12-20 18:53:45] <blackpumpkintv> its almost like twitch that gives us free content rely on adds:P
[2022-12-20 18:53:48] <@%+niclasvjensen> @niclasvjensen Twitch is a sponsor of the event, which has pushed the amount of adds up.  Again. A sub is very cheap, and then you get rid of them

[2022-12-20 18:57:15] <%SethSteckler> @niclasvjensen they are, but you telling people to sub to not see ads when subs saw 6 minutes of ads is, in my opinion, tone deaf
[2022-12-20 18:57:15] <snorrow92> @SethSteckler those ads only get played at dinner and lunch breaks, too bad it overlapped with the end of a key now, but normally wouldnt happen
[2022-12-20 18:57:56] <+evilconq> havent seen a single add here

[2022-12-20 19:27:53] <Zhivago399> imagine they play the entire instance and they have 2 mages. The first mage gets all the best shit the first run and now thats his main. Then they both log onto an alt and do the same for the other guy. Now thats a lot of of characters but 2 fully geared ones
[2022-12-20 19:28:12] <Darrows21> Makes sense

[2022-12-20 19:32:49] <abilitytogoeven> they already have 3 evoker healers, thats wubbys alt

[2022-12-20 19:32:53] <konst185> is it frost dk good on last boss?
[2022-12-20 19:33:09] <Nanny> evoker is really strong for raz yes
[2022-12-20 19:33:10] <abilitytogoeven> yes dk is good on last boss, they can immune every single knockback with deaths advance
