[2022-12-27 21:01:47] <%+AttemptedPants> Bro that map tho kleanGasm
[2022-12-27 21:01:55] <siddo__> that m203 better have a massive ergo penalty
[2022-12-27 21:01:56] <nopad_> NODDERS
[2022-12-27 21:02:03] <RyseUpGaming> @siddo__ exactly!
[2022-12-27 21:02:11] <grixvy> @murkyowl I would play rn and get used to guns and movement before tomorrow
[2022-12-27 21:02:20] <@%+fortburke> PMC karma?
[2022-12-27 21:02:36] <%+kp_00x> those new gloves?
[2022-12-27 21:02:42] <%+MurkyOwl> @grixvy Iam :p went from level 1 to 5 in about an hour earlier
[2022-12-27 21:02:43] <siddo__> doesnt PMC karma kind of defeat the purpose of the ffa looter style
[2022-12-27 21:02:52] <Rippetip> classic noobtube
[2022-12-27 21:02:58] <%+zaccray> hopefully aug doesnt turn into g36
[2022-12-27 21:03:00] <tomc1k> I think this map will have problems with fps
[2022-12-27 21:03:06] <jAmzye> aug gonna be the same as g36 i believe
[2022-12-27 21:03:07] <%+ooloafobutter> if its anything like the aug in black ops 1 we'll be okay
[2022-12-27 21:03:13] <bmac1572> @siddo__ Tarkov is supposed to be more than just a looter shooter
[2022-12-27 21:03:15] <@%+fortburke> @siddo__ FFA looter style was never the intention BSG had for the style
[2022-12-27 21:03:20] <+lordcthuluttv> this map if gonna be cool but gonna be nothing but corner campers, not enough to brin me back
[2022-12-27 21:03:25] <siddo__> @fortburke hmm interesting

[2022-12-27 21:05:15] <%+zaccray> maybe it was intentional
[2022-12-27 21:05:17] <+Karmordi> reserve trailer was dope, this one is kinda stale
[2022-12-27 21:05:20] <siddo__> it didnt feel like a trailer to hype people up, just more a quick showcase of streets and the new guns
[2022-12-27 21:05:20] <stunned_> @Klean where is your hat from
[2022-12-27 21:05:21] <Chinuch> compare this to the reserve trailer and the music too :D

[2022-12-27 21:05:43] <+GL0CKenspeil> they didnt really show anything we didnt see apart from more areas of the map i feel
[2022-12-27 21:05:50] <LongOnas> reserv trailer was the best
[2022-12-27 21:05:51] <+Tommy_Kase> this feels like an "epic" one with this music, because they know we've been waiting for so long
[2022-12-27 21:05:54] <+TeeJMcDeeJ> phantom key sound glitch
[2022-12-27 21:05:55] <@%+fortburke> Maybe they have spent so much time developing the actual update they had very little time for a trailer
[2022-12-27 21:05:56] <alxpax> is that a 9x21 smg ?
[2022-12-27 21:06:03] <+orionixward> anyone else have issues with video quality through lpvo sights being significantly worse that normal game quality?

[2022-12-27 21:06:38] <+GL0CKenspeil> if pmc karma actually makes it there could be big changes

[2022-12-27 21:07:40] <Blinkbaby_> Klean maybe that was like a tobacco pipe instead of a nose?
[2022-12-27 21:07:41] <+ClaymationLulz> i def like the trailer was just strange it just had no hype with it
[2022-12-27 21:07:46] <james_76235> There is a new AK muzzle device at 1:26. Don't think anyone has noticed yet. @Klean you recognise it?
[2022-12-27 21:07:46] <xToXni> hey Klean can i still order merch from BSG website?
[2022-12-27 21:07:53] <+Skatchel> JT's so cool, got to meet him with Oompaville the other week
[2022-12-27 21:07:56] <ShmityTV> @klean no info about wipe tomorrow. think it's thursday? who knows
[2022-12-27 21:07:58] <Vonkv> they showed a lot of lack of ammunition so i'm interested
[2022-12-27 21:08:02] <AlphAx0megA> Why do you think bsg used old footage from .12 for this and dropped a trailer last year on .13
[2022-12-27 21:08:08] <siddo__> i think the main reason that the trailer didnt feel that hype is that they barely showed anything new, we already had a streets showcase and saw the new guns @Klean
[2022-12-27 21:08:09] <+Chambiez> as long as they don't kill through floors and walls, i'm not too worried.
[2022-12-27 21:08:11] <asterio_12> how was your range day with brandon and co. you shooting that  svd was lit!!
[2022-12-27 21:08:17] <%+zaccray> impact grenades arent an issue i dont see tubes being a problem

[2022-12-27 21:31:54] <+Dracoon> @Klean i guess the question is how much do you want it to be a game and how much do you want it to be "realistic" there us a "best" round irl sname as a lightest material for somthing so on and so forth. so if you want "realistic" there wil be a best if you want game then you cna have 2 things be equil

[2022-12-27 21:33:22] <%+Nohk__> @Nohk__ Its just interesting. Its kind of like TikTok and China. Its a thread for influence, and I am surprised the US or EU govs havent done something yet. Its kind of interesting is all.

[2022-12-27 21:34:23] <+itzyaboiwhisky> like doing surgery on broken limbs and stapling an open wound. Not realistic, but fun and immersive imo
[2022-12-27 21:34:34] <bmac1572> Certain features are being added with “realism” in mind. Why go through the trouble of adding custom armour hotboxes
[2022-12-27 21:34:46] <cancerous_reply> @MERKYVED i mean the survival part is fun, what isnt fun is the janky combat and animations
[2022-12-27 21:34:56] <siddo__> i hope they change having to examine all the items traders sell tbh
[2022-12-27 21:35:01] <%+Nohk__> @Nohk__ Youre trying to get away from reality about a conflict between the West and Russia... by watching a videogame about a conflict between the West and Russia... hmmm...

[2022-12-27 21:37:38] <+Chambiez> that'd be real nice
[2022-12-27 21:37:45] <+Dracoon> totally correct the hardest thing in a game like tarkov to do is balance the "realism" and the game aspects full realism would make a boring stupid game but a full non real game just turns into COD where a pistol round has the same pen as a 7.62 round and goes 4 times as far

[2022-12-27 21:37:55] <whyworld420> true
[2022-12-27 21:38:01] <+Hey_Person> @Klean As Tarkov gets closer to full release and has better anti-cheat, do you think BSG will roll back on some rmt countermeasures like GPU LEDX limits in raid and bringing cases in raid?
[2022-12-27 21:38:06] <%Summerteeth> that'd be sick

[2022-12-27 21:39:15] <cancerous_reply> what you think if leveling attributes were leveled like ~20x faster but reset when you lose that pmc @Klean so its pmc based until the pmc dies

[2022-12-27 21:41:22] <bazookagamedev> representation is important and so easy for them to add

[2022-12-27 21:41:39] <+Hey_Person> @Docktershok Yes it is coming out this wipe, but only the first iteration of it, it's not going to be the whole map

[2022-12-27 21:57:17] <+blylock7> Tarky has to improve how long your out of raid. Takes forever to get in a raid sometimes
[2022-12-27 21:57:21] <%+SgtValkyrious> ive done 5 USMC and 5 in the army so far. fml lmao
[2022-12-27 21:57:22] <extraskindog> did you ever see combat?
[2022-12-27 21:57:29] <+Zanzabeak> Arena will deff bring in new blood too.

[2022-12-27 21:57:40] <%ColeChiIls> @blylock7  I think their idea to help that is just longer times in raid
[2022-12-27 21:57:40] <BeinionOnTwitch> do you think arena mode is gonnabe like tdm?

[2022-12-27 22:00:08] <+blylock7> I took a break this wipe too seems like there wasn’t much difference from the wipe before
[2022-12-27 22:00:09] <+estateow> Do you still have to bring your own loot into arena then? @Klean
[2022-12-27 22:00:13] <+zombiemeatspin> for the competitive mods and map size

[2022-12-27 22:02:24] <Greyfalll> they should make it stam drain scale up on repeated inputs

[2022-12-27 22:12:21] <%+moosE3knucklE> i just loved Dark and Darker's que times... they NAILED it.. hit Ready and you are in a game. it was amazing
[2022-12-27 22:12:25] <squireous> @Sam_Hall_ i really do not get the hype for dark and darker it looks so simple/boring

[2022-12-27 22:13:07] <+altezza300> it had to have been bigger than that
[2022-12-27 22:13:07] <Muted_Melody> @Klean  Do you know if they will have personal server support so we can host some of our own games with custom game modes?
[2022-12-27 22:13:10] <%KevinSredz> maybe on PC, but on console it was 24 players

[2022-12-27 22:20:55] <%+Justsaywhn> no thermal for me
[2022-12-27 22:21:02] <+DadTacticsTTv> Beer is going for 800K
[2022-12-27 22:21:02] <+hokies4lyfe24> @Klean You ever try the Star Wars mods for squad?
[2022-12-27 22:21:08] <jAmzye> @guessillgrowup haha I love sumsum but man do he complain LUL
[2022-12-27 22:21:09] <MornieTw> @Klean I want supressors and optics are only fir or so expensive or barter only because everyone put vudu on top of everything and be effective long and close range
[2022-12-27 22:21:09] <%+moosE3knucklE> @Wiztardo oh yeah it would they both play the same way... but Smoke doesnt really play this much. he comes back for a few days early wipe and then kinda just stays at DayZ

[2022-12-27 22:21:53] <Vonkv> agreed
[2022-12-27 22:21:53] <cropd_> i wish there would be gas build up when using a supressor

[2022-12-27 22:22:13] <Vonkv> i love pubg sound and gunplay
[2022-12-27 22:22:17] <%ColeChiIls> New cod suppressors are decent, can hear them from like 100m away
[2022-12-27 22:22:17] <guessillgrowup> yeah pubg did it good
[2022-12-27 22:22:18] <%ColeChiIls> sometimes
[2022-12-27 22:22:20] <CaptainSodium> Supressed and subsonic are different things, line gets blured in videogames sometimes
[2022-12-27 22:22:23] <AmaTerasu360> Ya Kar98 Supperesed sounds so GOOD Kreygasm
[2022-12-27 22:22:25] <@%$MustardOG> LUL
[2022-12-27 22:22:32] <MornieTw> and i wanna be happy when i found any supressor because when i use that i am gonna be silent
[2022-12-27 22:22:34] <+achilles531> same with dayz tho it's a little better then tarkov I think
[2022-12-27 22:22:36] <notaBlank> VPOs have a lot of downsides IRL though no? like the 1x is usually not very good iirc
[2022-12-27 22:22:39] <+GoldfishhDK> can you still do the thermal exploit?
[2022-12-27 22:22:40] <guessillgrowup> wish pubg was still like it was the first year
[2022-12-27 22:22:41] <Gogh> Had a raid where I couldn't hear a single gunshot but when I checked out dorms there was 8 bodies, I was around stronghold the whole time..
[2022-12-27 22:22:43] <%potatosacman> Yeah tarkov suppressor past 300 meters is silenced for some damn reason
[2022-12-27 22:22:43] <%+Justsaywhn> pubg was my jam back in the day

[2022-12-27 22:24:42] <Pentaxia> regardless. Playing a character that is "you" isn't roleplaying.... Playing a character that is different from you IS roleplaying...
[2022-12-27 22:24:48] <donefourr> the race accusation always stings on the inside bc there is no real way to say/prove ur not a racist
[2022-12-27 22:24:49] <Droknam> too many entitled babies
[2022-12-27 22:24:54] <+FatherOwens> wait scopes dont work with thermals?  i guess it makes sense, but never had a chance to get thermals in this game
[2022-12-27 22:24:55] <LameMen> gotta do what you gotta do
[2022-12-27 22:24:58] <+Its_TK_> is it safe to think wipe is thursday since thats when most patches get put in games?
[2022-12-27 22:25:03] <%+moosE3knucklE> i dont think they will either. that would lead down a rabbit hole of everyone wanting a race in the game and other genders and alot of drama could come from all that.
[2022-12-27 22:25:11] <viranth> Holy shit, just tested battlebit (the shooting area), the bullet drop and stuff is lit!
[2022-12-27 22:25:13] <+AppleKoreSiegeTeck> @Klean I'm black, been watching you for years and i have never once heard a racist thing come out of your mouth
[2022-12-27 22:25:29] <cappyjack_> Is that how Thermals operate IRL?
[2022-12-27 22:25:33] <+FatherOwens> battlebit just runs so damn good. thats the best part
[2022-12-27 22:25:39] <+FatherOwens> its so smooth
[2022-12-27 22:25:42] <cancerous_reply> im purple and ive never felt insulted by your comments even if you never pick purple characters in games @Klean
[2022-12-27 22:25:42] <+grovak> hindsight is still a good thing to do, toerhwise you cant learn from mistake. self reflection for growth is all hindsight

[2022-12-27 22:26:10] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> @losi_x my ears hurt
[2022-12-27 22:26:12] <acekanzy7> So much customization for character too it’s really sick
[2022-12-27 22:26:15] <viranth> It's a playtest every day at weird hours though
[2022-12-27 22:26:18] <+Its_TK_> does battle bit have aim assist because sometimes i swore it was snapping to players for me.
[2022-12-27 22:26:18] <losi_x> @losi_x what u mean
[2022-12-27 22:26:25] <+TarkBark> I just want battlebit to run on mac so i can play on my work computer lol

[2022-12-27 22:26:58] <Kuznia_> worst thing about battlebit is its not out yet and playtest are too short lol
[2022-12-27 22:27:00] <+Knight_Daddy> I had some funny times with the voip in that game.
[2022-12-27 22:27:02] <%potatosacman> How far can that GL range to?

[2022-12-27 22:27:06] <+FatherOwens> Has Klean said who he is playing the wipe with?
[2022-12-27 22:27:17] <5cavlive5matt3r> When is the Battlebit playtest?
[2022-12-27 22:27:17] <cropd_> @FatherOwens chat
[2022-12-27 22:27:18] <cancerous_reply> is the test in like 3 hours?

[2022-12-27 22:27:35] <+FatherOwens> Is the GL a straight line fire? or does it drop?
[2022-12-27 22:27:38] <+Stalkings_> you sure summit playing? all he does is complaain about the game lol
[2022-12-27 22:27:57] <+RealDealBillMcNeil> Aqua made a video on Battle Bit. It was really funny
[2022-12-27 22:27:57] <5cavlive5matt3r> Klean and Aqua play battlebit! bearkiHypers
[2022-12-27 22:28:01] <+ZayneD420> summit already said he was gunna try out the streets wipe @Stalkings_

[2022-12-27 22:28:31] <+FatherOwens> saw pestily shooting your sr25 thing sounds so chunky
[2022-12-27 22:28:42] <+MetalMilitia74> @Stalkings_ we all complain about the game, but at the end of the day we all come back because there is nothing else like it!
[2022-12-27 22:29:07] <%RyseUpGaming> when BB officially comes out you need to make a custom server that puts all the tarkov streamers tha game togeher and more against community members from all communites that would be sick
[2022-12-27 22:29:51] <BSDilly> cant wait for the wipe tomorrow

[2022-12-27 22:30:53] <%+moosE3knucklE> we dont know still
[2022-12-27 22:30:55] <mynicknameisjj1> @glandbo maybe;)
[2022-12-27 22:31:02] <BSDilly> we dont know for sure, but theres a high chance possibly
[2022-12-27 22:31:06] <+SteamingPileProductions> That would be a lot of our guesses
[2022-12-27 22:31:07] <+ImJho> its either tmw or thursday
[2022-12-27 22:31:08] <5cavlive5matt3r> @glandbo The expectation is yes. If not tomorrow, then Thursday

[2022-12-27 22:31:17] <aidentheg> so if it might wipe tom will they tweet today or tom?
[2022-12-27 22:31:19] <BeinionOnTwitch> whats th erange on the thermal goggles?
[2022-12-27 22:31:25] <BeinionOnTwitch> the range..
[2022-12-27 22:31:26] <+SteamingPileProductions> We all start from the beginning
[2022-12-27 22:31:27] <%+moosE3knucklE> @marklesterb accounts get reset
[2022-12-27 22:31:28] <luxohh> they probably would have put out a post already saying it was tmrw its midnight there so
[2022-12-27 22:31:29] <BSDilly> everything is reset, everyone goes back to 0
[2022-12-27 22:31:39] <+FatherOwens> @BeinionOnTwitch pretty much as far as you can see
[2022-12-27 22:31:44] <5cavlive5matt3r> @marklesterb A wipe occurs when the developers reset all accounts and add in a new patch with fixes and content.
[2022-12-27 22:31:49] <marklesterb> ah i see, so all the loot you got will be gone?
[2022-12-27 22:31:56] <%+moosE3knucklE> yessir
[2022-12-27 22:31:58] <visualized> is there a new event today?

[2022-12-27 22:32:15] <aidentheg> @marklesterb only like every 6 months tho
[2022-12-27 22:32:22] <+The_BMoe> why do people want a wipe I like my stuff
[2022-12-27 22:32:28] <5cavlive5matt3r> @visualized Everyone gets max traders and 99% off. It's historically the last prewipe event before wipe
[2022-12-27 22:32:32] <marklesterb> and from what i can tell this is a regular occurence with this game, right? every 6 months?
[2022-12-27 22:32:42] <visualized> just making sure i figure
[2022-12-27 22:32:42] <5cavlive5matt3r> @marklesterb Generally yes.
[2022-12-27 22:32:45] <visualized> figured*
[2022-12-27 22:33:03] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> I love the wipes
[2022-12-27 22:33:07] <nem0404> How big is street?
[2022-12-27 22:33:09] <kolofome> they gotta do some sort of ladder system right?
[2022-12-27 22:33:21] <+FatherOwens> prolly have ladder seasons
[2022-12-27 22:33:26] <DoodlezGrandpa> @nem0404 1 street big
[2022-12-27 22:33:29] <sequenta> eggyWiggle indeed
[2022-12-27 22:33:30] <marklesterb> right and this is still in beta i mean the version number is like 0.13
[2022-12-27 22:33:30] <+Imkonaldo> season must have at this state of the game
[2022-12-27 22:33:30] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> I quit after level 30 anyway because I hate late game stuff
[2022-12-27 22:33:32] <cropd_> whats poe
[2022-12-27 22:33:34] <+unnamed44> wipes wouldn't be necessary if the progression never ended
[2022-12-27 22:33:36] <kolofome> Street of Tarkov**
[2022-12-27 22:33:39] <guessillgrowup> didn't they say about one that wipes and one that doesn't
[2022-12-27 22:33:40] <sleepypeep0> seperate modes would be nice
[2022-12-27 22:33:41] <Jabootii> I think seasons would be dope
[2022-12-27 22:33:42] <BSDilly> path of exile
[2022-12-27 22:33:43] <+The_BMoe> and also we will combined all the areas into one big map
[2022-12-27 22:33:48] <Dev_24> that would def give people more time to level up their characters
[2022-12-27 22:33:55] <+BuddhaBurna> klean what chair do you have?
[2022-12-27 22:33:59] <marklesterb> @The_BMoe oh that sounds awesome
[2022-12-27 22:34:04] VIEWERS: 1 896
[2022-12-27 22:34:06] <kolofome> Path of Exile style seasonal ladders where you can keep your character but also start fresh w/ the boys....thats what this game needs imo
[2022-12-27 22:34:08] <%+moosE3knucklE> right. i mean its supposed to be harder to get gear when the game becomes what its supposed to be. we are just testing the gear right now lol
[2022-12-27 22:34:09] <BSDilly> talking about poe, the new league is amazing
[2022-12-27 22:34:12] <+Jonnybads> pumped for battlebit tonight, got a new ssd and forgot to reinstall it. glad you brought it up
[2022-12-27 22:34:13] <%+candyman______> from what i can make out they want servers that don't reset and some that do periodically to keep everyone happy
[2022-12-27 22:34:21] <Res_Quant> nikita said they will have 2 characters 1st is permanent the 2nd is seasonal
[2022-12-27 22:34:29] <visualized> no wipe could be sick, i just worry about it because a lot of people nowadays quit games so fast
[2022-12-27 22:34:37] <5cavlive5matt3r> Are you going to play Battlebit when the playtest releases in a few hours?
[2022-12-27 22:34:43] <@%$MustardOG> https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/
[2022-12-27 22:34:44] <+ZayneD420> well the way nikita said one time is if they wanna put new stuff in the game the way to make people want to test it is to wipe, otherwise why would u try out the new t3 armor and new gun when the RD is broken and u have 30mil so u just use slicks, ya know
[2022-12-27 22:34:46] <5cavlive5matt3r> Unless I misheard
[2022-12-27 22:34:47] <Lucas1332> is battlebit coming to early access any time soon?

[2022-12-27 22:34:53] <kolofome> really? i gotta check it out then, I'm a sandstorm guy

[2022-12-27 22:34:56] <BSDilly> have you ever played ready or not and would you reccomend it?
[2022-12-27 22:34:57] <+HypnoticRaven> I like the level playing field of a fresh wipe from a movement and gear perspective, but honestly a week in I am irritated by doing the tasks I have already done soooo many times
[2022-12-27 22:35:00] <guessillgrowup> @visualized i think no wipe will keep people coming back though. like casual people for sure
[2022-12-27 22:35:15] <+BuddhaBurna> cant wait for next Dark and Darker test
[2022-12-27 22:35:19] <+inmysc0pe> @hypnoticraven thank god they are switching them up hopefully

[2022-12-27 22:36:19] <+HypnoticRaven> That would be nice, I hope so with the streets addition. I would love it if we had to acctually unlock the maps this time
[2022-12-27 22:36:26] <%+moosE3knucklE> well i believe eft is gonna be a whole new expierence on release. so you wont really be rich so fast with a ton of gear. so wipes would be as necessary.

[2022-12-27 22:38:40] <%+candyman______> imagine we start up after the wipe and streets is the only map available
[2022-12-27 22:38:46] <oliverqueenll> makes gameplay different

[2022-12-27 22:38:50] <Lucas1332> so many people think tarkov is cod LUL
[2022-12-27 22:38:56] <DoodlezGrandpa> @Klean  golden words about playstile
[2022-12-27 22:38:56] <%+moosE3knucklE> most of them wouldnt prolly W key around either.
[2022-12-27 22:39:01] <+TheeDonut> 100% rather watch your gameplay over someone who runs back and forth between doorways over and over
[2022-12-27 22:39:05] <I__Need__Jesus> You think there’s any chances we get map to map travel this wipe
[2022-12-27 22:39:11] <%LZGxCARNAGEx> Thats why i watch
[2022-12-27 22:39:12] <+grovak> thermal snipes
[2022-12-27 22:39:14] <%Riddvick> Yea a lot of people think they are the arbiter of "valid" playstyles
[2022-12-27 22:39:19] <%phatdongl31> supressed scav i bet
[2022-12-27 22:39:21] <+GuvNaylor> you wont be able to W everywhere eventually anyway lul
[2022-12-27 22:39:21] <+SpaceSteg> @I__Need__Jesus probably not
[2022-12-27 22:39:22] <Booglelele> ah so bright
[2022-12-27 22:39:25] <+HighSenpai92> the way you game in general is what draws me to watch you over others
[2022-12-27 22:39:26] <%DeathlokTheDemolisher> thats how i feel most play the game is W key now
[2022-12-27 22:39:27] <+AntoniusJD> @I__Need__Jesus I think if anything, some time into the wipe but not on release
[2022-12-27 22:39:28] <guessillgrowup> @I__Need__Jesus i know you're asking klean but probalby not
[2022-12-27 22:39:31] <%aikidragon> I love the slow, tactical, methodical way that you approach when playing.
[2022-12-27 22:39:31] <+captmoroni25> Always loved the chill, tactical way you play. Its why I've lurked here for so long. Always chill
[2022-12-27 22:39:33] <%+moosE3knucklE> im too afraid to W key around in tarkov. lol i play solo so im not tryin to get surrounded
[2022-12-27 22:39:34] <+MetalMilitia74> @I__Need__Jesus 0 %
[2022-12-27 22:39:38] <+darth_vato> i find the slow gameplay more tense and entertaining in the long run
[2022-12-27 22:39:42] <RustySpaceNick> You could say your playstyle is Klean TPFufun
[2022-12-27 22:39:44] <%Dev_24> do you think tarkov going more hardcore in the end would turn a lot of people away from the game?
[2022-12-27 22:39:49] <%+candyman______> i would rather see a more tactical and methodical play style, W key actually bores the shit out of me to watch
[2022-12-27 22:40:02] <horsewood> @Dev_24 they never intended it for casuals..

[2022-12-27 22:40:17] <+vlafyus> the way you play this game is refreshing
[2022-12-27 22:40:17] <+FatherOwens> more and more people crave hardcore games

[2022-12-27 22:40:27] <%Dev_24> true, I cant wait for arena.
[2022-12-27 22:40:29] <sleepypeep0> the want for hardcore style games is only increasing
[2022-12-27 22:40:30] <bmac1572> @dev_24 It was always supposed to be more hardcore. People should read about a product before they buy it
[2022-12-27 22:40:36] <+grovak> arena will make raiding against most players much more sweaty
[2022-12-27 22:40:41] <Shrenko> @Klean hate to bring in bad news but did you see that the STALKER dev Volodymyr Ezhov got killed in Bakhmut last week? so fucking sad....
[2022-12-27 22:40:53] <JiggyT> @bmac1572 lol it wasnt too hardcore back then bro
[2022-12-27 22:40:58] <CaptainSodium> Identity.
[2022-12-27 22:40:58] <emrjinc> Speaking of playstyles: I really appreciate how you can match your style of play to your mood.  Sometimes you like to slang and bang.  Sometimes you like to rat.  And sometimes you like to be the TarGod.  And I'm here for all of it.
[2022-12-27 22:41:00] <aidentheg> ppl used to say im trash cause i learned on SPT but ima beast on Live now thanks to SPT honestly
[2022-12-27 22:41:02] <%koiks_> what about any other editions to current maps? or are the finished 100%
[2022-12-27 22:41:04] <%aikidragon> What I'd love the most in Tarkov would be faster matchmaking/hopping into raids.
[2022-12-27 22:41:05] <%Dev_24> 100% agree I love tarkov for the fact that its in depth in the way that it is.
[2022-12-27 22:41:07] <Zeel0t> normies REEEE
[2022-12-27 22:41:09] <+SpaceDuckGG> Is Arena going to have loseable gear the same way EFT will? Or is it going preset loadouts or something?
[2022-12-27 22:41:10] <sleepypeep0> this how how great games are made, out of love and certain niches
[2022-12-27 22:41:18] <%+candyman______> a gun nuts dream of a game lol
[2022-12-27 22:41:29] <%nalluska> Game also literally made a ton of money already so they dont have to aim for the most mainstream shit anymore
[2022-12-27 22:41:33] <%+famedultrafox> What do you think of insurgency Klean?
[2022-12-27 22:41:39] <bmac1572> @jiggyt Tarkovs planned plans which have been know since 2016 have always been hardcore

[2022-12-27 22:42:14] BITS: HypnoticRaven (100)
[2022-12-27 22:42:14] <+HypnoticRaven> Cheer100 I am hopeful but doubtful that "quest overhaul" means we progress through the maps this time and everyone has to start on streets. I cant wait for the day that I never have to leave raid.
[2022-12-27 22:42:20] <cropd_> have you managed to kill the goons?

[2022-12-27 22:42:24] <mastakilla__> @Klean what you think about SQUAD
[2022-12-27 22:42:26] <+garyjohn80> i love that game
[2022-12-27 22:42:42] <%+candyman______> i've never fired real steel, how does tarkov recoil compare in terms of realism?
[2022-12-27 22:42:44] <b0shii> would someone who was never into battlefield games enjoy battlebit. is it that much better?
[2022-12-27 22:42:45] <+j_wise_> gamemodes in sandstorm are boring and outdated
[2022-12-27 22:42:47] <%+StealthyHazboola> Escape from Tarkov is a great game for what it is, a game current in development kleanActually
[2022-12-27 22:42:50] <%TheSamuelC> they barely added anything to the game either over time it seemed
[2022-12-27 22:42:51] <+AntoniusJD> Squad is meh, but kinda of scratches that itch from time to time for me
[2022-12-27 22:42:51] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> SQUAD is great. The people who play it arnt... its sad
[2022-12-27 22:42:59] <bypized> I have a hard time enjoying games without progression
[2022-12-27 22:43:01] <%RyseUpGaming> what about ground branch? heard an update is coming and it will revamp maps and night vison and more
[2022-12-27 22:43:05] <cropd_> have you read nikitas tweet about the new tasks?
[2022-12-27 22:43:07] <+SpaceDuckGG> Took a break from EFT this wipe but I'm super stoked to come back
[2022-12-27 22:43:08] <horsewood> Stepping Stone, 1.

[2022-12-27 22:43:26] <lilROOKZ> will we have to re-buy the game?
[2022-12-27 22:43:29] <+alex_in_stl> I like hearing your logic. What are your thoughts about Squads?

[2022-12-27 22:44:22] <Ravejeuit> solo for life
[2022-12-27 22:44:26] <shinegrog> pmc karma will help i guess
[2022-12-27 22:44:27] <+SyrBryn> I love how excited you get when you talk about potential of a game.
[2022-12-27 22:44:33] <Shrenko> having no one to play with sucks
[2022-12-27 22:44:35] <%aikidragon> Some sort of shared quest progress would be great for groups
[2022-12-27 22:44:36] <Rawsick> problem is when you queue as a solo, you can get thrown against only groups of 5. theres no balance to it to make it only 1-3 man groups
[2022-12-27 22:44:36] <%Dev_24> trailer heavy hinted at maybe PMC karma which would be cool

[2022-12-27 22:45:04] <lilROOKZ> thought i remembered hearing way back when, if you only got the Standard Edition, you'd have to re-buy whenever it launched. idk, glad thats not the case
[2022-12-27 22:45:06] <sumuk4> its all about squads and teamates killing each other KEKW
[2022-12-27 22:45:07] <%Dev_24> @JohnnyMerkem i dont think they would ever do revive
[2022-12-27 22:45:09] <moosyah7> people grouping against AI Kappa sure thing

[2022-12-27 22:45:14] <Lucas1332> im actually very excited for pmc karma, my favorite thing to do in this game is teaming up with random people mid raid
[2022-12-27 22:45:14] <bmac1572> @jiggyt I understand. My point is that I bought this game in 2018 knowing that stuff like interia/other hardcore features would be added later because I read the games development plans. So you shouldnt invest in a product that is going to keep changing into something that you don’t like.
[2022-12-27 22:45:22] <+HypnoticRaven> Hell thats what the Raid series is about, they fight then team up
[2022-12-27 22:45:28] <%+candyman______> i personally think and more than a 3 man gets too confusing, "is that you" lol
[2022-12-27 22:45:32] <JohnnyMerkem> I thought a revive was planned
[2022-12-27 22:45:39] <Raava25> its has been 7 years from tarkov beta relase if ım not wrong ı dont any expectation any more
[2022-12-27 22:45:43] <%Dev_24> I love solos too tho
[2022-12-27 22:45:43] <lilPUGB> that makes sense if your squad has a bear an a usec with pmc karma
[2022-12-27 22:45:45] <%$trickypig> I love all of the content you put out don't get me wrong but DAMN does Blean back on Tarky hit diff

[2022-12-27 22:45:53] <CoockooMcGoo> @candyman______ for real i hate 4 and 5 mans
[2022-12-27 22:45:55] <+JayD_92> PMC karma makes no sens
[2022-12-27 22:45:55] <+Fonziety> What’s up klean ! Hoops you had a happy holiday !
[2022-12-27 22:45:57] <aidentheg> there needs to be a team kill system because joining random teams in EFT is not IT lol
[2022-12-27 22:46:02] <+Fonziety> Hope*

[2022-12-27 22:46:42] <%Dev_24> @AugustMV im still hoping for it to be a secret change this wipe but I doubt
[2022-12-27 22:46:46] <+Zalan03> yeah perma-alpha state = developer excuse to have broken game. 7 days to die comes to mind
[2022-12-27 22:46:49] <deciBel42> Howdy everyone
[2022-12-27 22:46:55] <+DomB_QC> The worst word of all "early access"
[2022-12-27 22:46:56] <+AntoniusJD> Any insights on when they'll think about shoulder-swapping? @Klean
[2022-12-27 22:47:00] <kolofome> i heard unconscious state was shelved for the time being
[2022-12-27 22:47:02] <%+StealthyHazboola> Not a true beta, kleanStare well best Alpha in existence

[2022-12-27 22:47:15] <gonz0e> How long till the game hits 1.0 you think?
[2022-12-27 22:47:18] <CoockooMcGoo> @Zalan03 ya but imo tarkov isn't trying to do that.
[2022-12-27 22:47:20] <jakkuba99> @Klean so in full release all the location will be a single map?
[2022-12-27 22:47:21] <%aikidragon> Shared progression for some tasks and faster matchmaking would be what I'd love the most in the game.
[2022-12-27 22:47:27] <%+candyman______> @candyman______ i can see that but you'd have to be very coordinated, i feel that people play more sloppy when in larger groups because they feel more confident
[2022-12-27 22:47:30] <+GeTLikeshooK> oh god afk

[2022-12-27 22:53:54] <Burepishta> That's why it's good to take them after you eatr

[2022-12-27 22:58:29] <Dom4Glory> It shoots, it’s technical, it’s physical, you can hunt game, its a sport, you can dump thousands of hours into into it to refine your knowledge and grow as a person. Pretty solid hobby
[2022-12-27 22:58:29] <DoodlezGrandpa> sadly in my country civilian gun culture is supressed by years. every ear the amount of owners lowers, prises rise and laws to get you a gun is more complex

[2022-12-27 22:58:50] <%ColeChiIls> @Klean Dude no one listens to me when I tell em to watch Black Mirror, that show called so much LUL
[2022-12-27 22:58:51] <ArtyLite> it been happenin in the US with the vax passports
[2022-12-27 22:58:51] <+JayD_92> The problem is the Americans who don't practice gun safety which is why you hear about a ton of shootings. People like Klean and others who you'd call gun "fanatics" are never going to go shoot anywhere up. They have their guns for their own enjoyment.
[2022-12-27 22:58:51] <Dulius6> Alot of them dont like it LUL
[2022-12-27 22:58:51] <FennorBellic> @Booglelele yup and sites are tested regularly for it

[2022-12-27 23:04:11] <+Dudeface85> the whole vitamin thing is a scam. minerals are the important thing. i am 37 years into nutrition and health. supplementing minerals is important. if you have proper mineral balance your body naturally pulls all your needed vitamins from good natural fruits and veggies

[2022-12-27 23:09:50] <rollatorsved> If people are looking for a fun sport then I can highly recommend mountain biking. Its really fun and lots of parts to upgrade ect..
[2022-12-27 23:09:50] <%+AgoraphobiSnack> lack of trigger discipline in television and movies is really irritating to me.
[2022-12-27 23:09:52] <hhdyc> why does everyone have a nade launcher?
[2022-12-27 23:09:53] <%TypeOneOperator> @klean you ever kit up and go "larping" out inawoods or anything?
[2022-12-27 23:09:54] <+DarkPrometheus112> @Akkrecola bruh fact checkers doesn't mean anything cause you can fact check something through circular reporting and have something completely untrue be true cause it's been reported as such somewhere else
[2022-12-27 23:09:56] <notaBlank> @witbull09 lol, fair enough

[2022-12-27 23:10:31] <+HypnoticRaven> BSG's master plan to desensitize us to the coming undermounted GL's with this event is brilliant LUL

[2022-12-27 23:10:47] <notaBlank> @DarkPrometheus112 fact checker generally links primary sources, just fyi
[2022-12-27 23:10:57] <+AppleKoreSiegeTeck> sensitivity training is important.
[2022-12-27 23:10:57] <DoodlezGrandpa> @HypnoticRaven they will be ultra rare i bet, i never found GL since they been added KEKW

[2022-12-27 23:11:08] <+Herr_Scharfi> @TheJokesOnYou  i guess it will be on the 31.12 .. because the trailer video was released at 21:13 ... read it backwards and yeah .. thats why i think the wipe comes on 31.12.22 ^^
[2022-12-27 23:11:12] <%+GotJuh> so how rare are the underbarrel launchers going to be. because that sounds annoying af

[2022-12-27 23:11:52] <jay_muro> Wow so all these Rssas games where last wipe then. My life is going by so fast in Tarkov wipes

[2022-12-27 23:11:55] <rainsomemore> i bought that dwarf game yesterday and had to refund immediately lol too hard for me smh
[2022-12-27 23:11:56] <notaBlank> @doctorj76 how enlightening, thank you
[2022-12-27 23:11:57] <Akkrecola> @Akkrecola What? Are you claiming that fact checking works by taking an another (news) article and contrasting it by the original claim? I'm not native English speaker so I might miss something, sorry.
[2022-12-27 23:11:58] <+shyintrovert_> Kotton too
[2022-12-27 23:12:00] <Ale_NH4> I loved bannerlord :D

[2022-12-27 23:12:07] <+Sam_Hall_> Did Seq start off in EFT?
[2022-12-27 23:12:12] <deciBel42> I loved when you started playing zomboid on stream. I started learning a lot about that game.
[2022-12-27 23:12:14] <CoockooMcGoo> You really need a big following to branch out to variety streaming though

[2022-12-27 23:12:25] <+HypnoticRaven> the original Chad Dad 41 is all variety LUL
[2022-12-27 23:12:25] <%+GotJuh> I'd like to see WillerZ do more variety. Lvndmark played a little of COD atleast
[2022-12-27 23:12:26] <notaBlank> @DeathlokTheDemolisher you can if you want, like i sad they list primary sources
[2022-12-27 23:12:32] <%$trickypig> Rando question but what DPI do y'all play tarky at
[2022-12-27 23:12:40] <BigBodyBerz> few go variety and don't come back. lol Sacriel was one of my faves.
[2022-12-27 23:12:44] <notaBlank> @doctorj76 i do, thats why i believe you, and am now enlightened
[2022-12-27 23:12:47] <kangtaum> discovered deadlyslob not long ago and its ez top streamer for me thos days

[2022-12-27 23:13:03] <+alex_in_stl> Yup
[2022-12-27 23:13:03] <+fundraser> Viewers want to see you enjoy playing the game. When the streamer isn
[2022-12-27 23:13:04] <+Jurgenaut2> deadlyslob's super funny..."barry smallhands" and "The Weasel"
[2022-12-27 23:13:05] <+HypnoticRaven> Kotton hardly ever plays EFT too
[2022-12-27 23:13:05] <ArtyLite> following and fanbase is different ninja was on fortnite with 200K viewers, where they at now
[2022-12-27 23:13:07] <cope__addict> @trickypig 800 it doesn't matter though like at all.
[2022-12-27 23:13:09] <witbull09> 40k was lit, bannerlord online was really cool. mortal online. You have had a good content variety man
[2022-12-27 23:13:12] <%thenamesshane> damn stight fax.

[2022-12-27 23:13:20] <+fundraser> Viewers want to see you enjoy playing the game. When the streamer isnenjoying it we can tell and it isnt as fun to watch
[2022-12-27 23:13:22] <+MissingNumb> @Klean It is also a risk for the solo streamer: if a game dies or a community dies the streamer go's with it
[2022-12-27 23:13:22] <wisnia74> loved seeing you play DF, last thing I expected on twitch was seeing a guy that plays mostly tarkov, play DF and ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT
[2022-12-27 23:13:23] <%ziixxyy> Do you have any tips for someone wanting to get their foot into the door with streaming? @Klean
[2022-12-27 23:13:24] <%+doctorj76> @notaBlank it's pretty funny you think a fact checker is legit though, I'll give you that
[2022-12-27 23:13:24] <%+StormDevv> Do you think venison, shot myself, processed from a local butcher, is good for you?
[2022-12-27 23:13:31] <+Herr_Scharfi> well its your stream , you can do what every you want !
[2022-12-27 23:13:34] <%$Jakeman951> true and always stocked to see range streams
[2022-12-27 23:13:34] <Ramsesmfg> i remember the anomaly streams back in the day with 300 people, this year you had around 1.2k playing gamma
[2022-12-27 23:13:36] <+KugelWerfer88> i watch you for tarkov, but im not mad when you play other stuff i mean its your thing to do what you want to

[2022-12-27 23:13:37] <%OldNorse> @BigBodyBerz Sacriel has been around since the wee days of DayzMod...

[2022-12-27 23:13:47] <%KimorySelkies> you can have actual fun working instead of stuck playing 1 thing
[2022-12-27 23:13:48] <LoesoeLuukk> tbh watching some of the big only tarkov streamers, half of them doesnt even seem happy
[2022-12-27 23:13:49] <whitecinder> Im really looking forward to seeing Smoke jump back in for this next wipe
[2022-12-27 23:13:50] <daz_enners> streamers having variety is so much better and opens up more things. seeing you and sac playing D&D has been so good. the banter you two have has been great to watch
[2022-12-27 23:13:54] <%Borlng> Jokes on you I just so happen to only be interested in all the games you variety with.
[2022-12-27 23:14:03] <wisnia74> nice man, keep it up, love to see it

[2022-12-27 23:14:32] <%ColeChiIls> I like that you dont really act different when viewers are low, or high. Some streamers seem to complain when numbers are low
[2022-12-27 23:14:33] <EricTheSwedishGuy> Hey Klean, been lurkin for a while due to school. Did you decide on making a new Discord?
[2022-12-27 23:14:33] <daz_enners> you both have similar playstyles on tarkov so thatll be good to see
[2022-12-27 23:14:35] <notaBlank> @doctorj76 no, i didnt ever say that, youre mistaken or cant read

[2022-12-27 23:28:33] <TheWaveintheDark> the meta will always shift and it will be something new..but they change it so much and make it impossible for casual players to find an equalizer
[2022-12-27 23:28:33] <+izmariozz> What is your opinion on battlebit?
[2022-12-27 23:28:35] <%$Jakeman951> kleanVodka
[2022-12-27 23:28:38] <Synthabilly> IMO 5.56 guns should have way more ergo and less recoil if they're supposed to compete with 7.62 guns
[2022-12-27 23:28:51] <bmac1572> @whitecinder Just a better mag fed ak shotgun irl
[2022-12-27 23:28:55] <+FatherOwens> man drinking water makes me nauseous, always has, have to force myself to drink it
[2022-12-27 23:28:55] <CoockooMcGoo> @Klean have u heard of using all natural ginsing pills for appetite boost and weight gain?

[2022-12-27 23:28:59] <%+moosE3knucklE> @notaBlank its not as bad as it was tho... 32 recoil 762 gun.. kid yourself lol
[2022-12-27 23:29:05] <+kakeris> what is the best ammo for the sks?
[2022-12-27 23:29:11] <+MolagAmur> I still hate they gutted the 9x39 guns :/
[2022-12-27 23:29:12] <+fundraser> trey was disappointed that didnt happen
[2022-12-27 23:29:14] <%Dev_24> would like to have a hour of nikita
[2022-12-27 23:29:14] <+Sam_Hall_> Klean, not sure how involved you still are with Jon Kyoto, but I always recommend his music/playlist when I get the chance to other streamers. Thanks again for helping out all that together, one of my favorite chill playlists!
[2022-12-27 23:29:18] <%MagicMeech> have they implemented anything toward larger mags having more failure to feed issues?
[2022-12-27 23:29:23] <notaBlank> @moosE3knucklE anything that shoots bp with low recoil is meta, its still a laser
[2022-12-27 23:29:26] <Qcbeast13> @kakeris bp when you can get it, early lvl ps
[2022-12-27 23:29:32] <cirkules> Whats the deal with arena? I thought it was coming this wipe.
[2022-12-27 23:29:32] <+shyintrovert_> The Tarkov community is so toxic man. Everyone just moans all the time. Can people not just enjoy the game for what it is
[2022-12-27 23:29:35] <%ColeChiIls> @MagicMeech pretty sure they already have
[2022-12-27 23:29:35] <+MolagAmur> They were too good. But now they are too bad. Its like you said...they are extremes
[2022-12-27 23:29:39] <+edgelord535> arenas not coming out for six years just like streets
[2022-12-27 23:29:41] <Akkrecola> Do you think they'll keep the gun stats same between base game and Arena? And not adjust the meta separately?
[2022-12-27 23:29:44] <notaBlank> @moosE3knucklE but yes its not AS bad for sure, mutant was super broken when it released
[2022-12-27 23:29:47] <TheWaveintheDark> the value of good gear is to keep pace with the hardcore players..but if the hardcore players are also running the good gear nobody is having fun but them
[2022-12-27 23:29:58] <devinelife> same with the ap sx ammo i want that back, its impossible to get
[2022-12-27 23:30:00] <%Freckles619> with LucasTREX or not on the podcast?
[2022-12-27 23:30:01] <+Champ24life1> we on battlebit later?
[2022-12-27 23:30:04] <+Rewarc> Well there is a couple of easy ways to balances weapons. You balance them by caliber, you balance them with attachments or you make every single gun playable and just tweak the modern guns to be slightly better
[2022-12-27 23:30:06] <KushMyLastName> In a perfect world meta guns do not exist

[2022-12-27 23:30:39] <%mosqeet> It's almost like guns are as useful as their operator makes them
[2022-12-27 23:30:40] <+BullitK> A big step to getting rid of the meta would be changing the way attachments work.

[2022-12-27 23:30:59] <lj535> the M4 recoil on the first 3 - 5 rounds is so annoying, when the AK kick is ez with BP
[2022-12-27 23:31:00] <Peakasso> @abnjeremy i like that one

[2022-12-27 23:32:32] <%+moosE3knucklE> you like Dwarf Fortress youd prolly enjoy RimWorld. ive been playin a shit ton of Rimworld the last few months
[2022-12-27 23:32:37] <TheWaveintheDark> what we end up with is a bunch of mid level players running meta builds stuffing it to the hardcore guys who quit leaving the newbies uninspired so they quit and the mid players in a meta circle jerk
[2022-12-27 23:32:38] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> DCS Cinematics get me hard
[2022-12-27 23:32:39] <Akkrecola> Making best attachments FIR only BUT have them appear at max lvl Fence when left to map would be cool.

[2022-12-27 23:33:18] <+BullitK> All attachments of the same type should give the same stat changes. Then its just a chage to ammo then almost all guns would be meta

[2022-12-27 23:47:34] <lj535> I seriously hope 545 AK ammo doesn't not 1 tap headshot scavs, early wipe its brutal

[2022-12-27 23:47:54] <Dulius6> Whos Idea was it to give Scavs Nade Launchers
[2022-12-27 23:48:02] <guessillgrowup> @Vonkv they are adding something. i think it's supposed to have an animation and everything so it won't just be scroll and it's done

[2022-12-27 23:50:38] <+MetalMilitia74> addiction needs to be added
[2022-12-27 23:50:48] <%BerlinCB> I think people are reading WAY too much into the trailer.
[2022-12-27 23:50:58] <witbull09> maybe the two different kinds will mater.
[2022-12-27 23:50:59] <+Terpzs> Take off the tinfoil hats people
[2022-12-27 23:50:59] <+kingkobra45> there would have to be some serioys benefits for the risk of tryting to befriend other pmcs.
[2022-12-27 23:51:00] <+SpaceSteg> people saying cant scav on streets cause they nodded no
[2022-12-27 23:51:04] <bootyraider420> I think it could work, we would see a lot more voiping interactions. but I dont think they're adding pmc Karma
[2022-12-27 23:51:05] <%mosqeet> They would need to add factions for pmc karma to mean anything, otherwise it's all player interactions anyway
[2022-12-27 23:51:09] <+SpaceSteg> the tin foil hat going on right now
[2022-12-27 23:51:10] <avaris_gr> anything new with EFT the last couple of months? i am taking big changes
[2022-12-27 23:51:11] <p0lsevas> pmc karma is coming at some Point anyway
[2022-12-27 23:51:13] <Dulius6> Anyone else stuck on a Disconnected Server?!
[2022-12-27 23:51:15] <+jelyfrosts> i just think the trailer was only to show off streets and maybe the lighthouse keeper dude
[2022-12-27 23:51:16] <Peakasso> @stealthyhazboola but honstly Ibuprofen is quit helpful even im not a huge fan of pharma
[2022-12-27 23:51:17] <x40calx> So is wipe still unknown ? Sorry if u said something already just got in here heard u say something bout patch notes tomorrow
[2022-12-27 23:51:21] <moosyah7> probably, but I think the factions are way in favor for USEC for it to work. This aint World of Warcraft aliance vs horde balance, and even that one was bad on some servers
[2022-12-27 23:51:23] <p2wftl> Being it's only 2am in Russia, we will see on their twitter within the next 10 hours. They will 100% give a days notice for the wipe, they announced a tech update the day before KEKW @Klean
[2022-12-27 23:51:23] <+RunScottyRun> But Klean reddit said Kappa LUL
[2022-12-27 23:51:28] <guessillgrowup> pmc karma would be cool i think. could possibly slow people down if it effects certain traders. some people will be more prone to not kill i think just to voip and find out what you are
[2022-12-27 23:51:28] <%+AgoraphobiSnack> i'm still crossing my fingers for random flatulence for the bush wookies.
[2022-12-27 23:51:31] <siddo__> @x40calx yeah nothing confirmed but very very likely tomorrow or day after
[2022-12-27 23:51:51] <+Terpzs> Pmc karma or not, it’s still on sight for any pmc regardless. Just me
[2022-12-27 23:51:54] <siddo__> @AgoraphobiSnack eating beans increases the chance by 100%

[2022-12-27 23:52:11] <moeykaner> they could just give bonus xp for a kill of the other faction. would be enough

[2022-12-27 23:52:24] <%+AgoraphobiSnack> @siddo__ exactly. bunny hopping would be hysterical.

[2022-12-27 23:53:01] <avaris_gr> @avaris_gr its also kind of a big deal too, its a bit game breaking to only get squads of 3
[2022-12-27 23:53:03] <%mosqeet> I think people forget the game is barely playable for the first ~12 hours after wipe

[2022-12-27 23:55:18] <+TheUrbanApache> @TheUrbanApache if i wanted to rat i wouldnt be playing dead tho? it was more a thought of if theres people running up on you maybe you could play dead and if they go to loot your screwed but maybe they pass u up idk could be fun but hey im a rat :)
[2022-12-27 23:55:19] <KiNGCOMMAND> Is gear hella cheap now?
[2022-12-27 23:55:22] <+Sam_Hall_> @madmartigan32 it’s fun, but performance anxiety was high for me at first bc second was friend of gf. Wild times lol
[2022-12-27 23:55:29] <jarudah> i think it sucks for solo players.. it feels like bsg encourages to play in group

[2022-12-27 23:56:02] <siddo__> @jarudah you do have one massive advantage as a solo, nothing is friendly. you can shoot everything

[2022-12-27 23:56:04] <+Lucifer626> us lonely players just gotta be smarter
[2022-12-27 23:56:06] <LuteGoblinz> game is easy enough for solo players tbh
[2022-12-27 23:56:07] <Booglelele> playing as a group is harder though unless u know what ur doing
[2022-12-27 23:56:08] <justcarbunkle> even all the trailers have people in teams
[2022-12-27 23:56:09] <+BeCarter> @FunkieIsFresh its not. You good?
[2022-12-27 23:56:11] <countnefario> game is more fun solo, all the loot is yours
[2022-12-27 23:56:13] <%$Jakeman951> gn mr streamer and have a fun BB play test
[2022-12-27 23:56:16] <siddo__> @Klean IRL, how much does something like a simple foregrip matter for recoil compensation?
[2022-12-27 23:56:19] <BeinionOnTwitch> HeyGuys
[2022-12-27 23:56:19] <+SonReyes> Or you lonely players can start finding people to play with
[2022-12-27 23:56:20] <%+StealthyHazboola> duo best
[2022-12-27 23:56:21] <%+moosE3knucklE> which is why as a solo play i try to group with other solo's to fight the groups lol
[2022-12-27 23:56:22] <jarudah> we will make it work :D
[2022-12-27 23:56:24] <%BerlinCB> Not every game should be tailored to your individual desires.  jlmRoan
[2022-12-27 23:56:26] <%+StealthyHazboola> solo second best
[2022-12-27 23:56:30] <+SonReyes> plenty of discords to group up with if no friends play
[2022-12-27 23:56:30] <Wulfgar_RED> and my friends don't want to play :(

[2022-12-27 23:56:34] <anchovyjones> Duos is where this game shines
[2022-12-27 23:56:45] <avaris_gr> i dont get it, how is the game designed for groups?
[2022-12-27 23:56:48] <avaris_gr> there are no roles
[2022-12-27 23:56:49] <DirecThreat> duos is best
[2022-12-27 23:56:50] <count3rnova> playign with friends is way more entertaining doing on point comms and control
[2022-12-27 23:56:51] <+MetalMilitia74> @Booglelele 4+ eyes are better than 2!!!
[2022-12-27 23:56:52] <%+impecabletimeing> Most of my groups five mans are chaos
[2022-12-27 23:56:52] <+rakeden> When are drops scheduled to start?
[2022-12-27 23:56:55] <+rgbsketchers> cant flood comms
[2022-12-27 23:56:57] <+jelyfrosts> four is prolly my limit for group play so much communication needed
[2022-12-27 23:56:57] <%BerlinCB> I love 2 and 3, 4 gets really chaotic.
[2022-12-27 23:56:58] <+EbakZarr> @Klean I keep wanting to hang some firearms in my room, and I've checked out that system you've got, but then I go look at more luxury options, and I get burnt out because they're so expensive. Anything you dislike about that system now that you've got it
[2022-12-27 23:56:58] <Altoption> I don't care if I get slapped as a solo, I just wish it didn't take half an hour before getting into another raid FeelsBlyatMan
[2022-12-27 23:57:04] <moogichan> Love watching Drewski and his squads play
[2022-12-27 23:57:07] <%Kitkatzlol> @Klean bro, I love watching your GAMMA past streams, I would love u playing it again <3
[2022-12-27 23:57:09] <Booglelele> @Booglelele not always
[2022-12-27 23:57:14] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> Its almost like theere are groups.... so its designed for it.....
[2022-12-27 23:57:14] <+Mujahidz> What game is BSG?
[2022-12-27 23:57:16] <p2wftl> solo is easiest, kill anything that moves. \
[2022-12-27 23:57:16] <siddo__> @avaris_gr with how insurance works, if you die you buddy can always toss stuff. and of course you always have an advantage being with more people
[2022-12-27 23:57:19] <+volcomwolf_> people think this is just another COD game
[2022-12-27 23:57:21] <%ziixxyy> What if you don't have friends to play with? Kappa
[2022-12-27 23:57:24] <%MagicMeech> im interested in a ACE like medical system akin to arma 3 modded version
[2022-12-27 23:57:25] <Danas_K> Watch how Airwingmarine plays with Tower and more ppl. Their coms are ON POINT
[2022-12-27 23:57:32] <guessillgrowup> i can only do duo's with my friends. every time we did trio's they'd yell "IT'S ME IT'S ME" and then i'd get shot. by them.
[2022-12-27 23:57:32] <Peakasso> 3 is a Magic number.  Great Song
[2022-12-27 23:57:34] <LuteGoblinz> groups vs solo is always in the group favor but comms and experience normally swing it towards the solo players favor
[2022-12-27 23:57:34] <+Kaniela1904> Didnt they say its a group game that you CAN play solo
[2022-12-27 23:57:38] <Rephlex___> Playing solo is a fun challenge, but to really succeed groups are the way
[2022-12-27 23:57:40] <+ViolentDecay> batterstate
[2022-12-27 23:57:49] <+GGTremble> lmao
[2022-12-27 23:57:50] <mc_st0nerr> Was your response to my statement passive aggressive or am i tweaking? Lol @klean
[2022-12-27 23:57:52] <+SpaceSteg> russia 2028 when
[2022-12-27 23:57:53] <Synthabilly> I mean there's factions in Tarkov. They don't function entirely yet but factions are teams lol

[2022-12-27 23:57:53] <Altoption> YEP
[2022-12-27 23:57:54] <ImBigWheel> @Klean bro I've been watching you on and off for a while, but I've got to say and no offence, it seems like every time you play Tarkov it just drains the life out of you man. You just seem down. Hope all is well big G
[2022-12-27 23:58:03] <joeybeanslive> u should try hunt showdown
[2022-12-27 23:58:03] <anchovyjones> Customs looks like it actually runs well now
[2022-12-27 23:58:04] <countnefario> reason this game is so good is people who play fast dosent always work, campers are rewarded.
[2022-12-27 23:58:07] <+jelyfrosts> have they said anything on their arena game they talked somewhat about?
[2022-12-27 23:58:09] <+boomjahha> its like modern warfare dark and darker
[2022-12-27 23:58:10] <+eljebus0> @SpaceSteg Probably about 5 years.
[2022-12-27 23:58:11] <daz_enners> @Klean did you see one of the Stalker devs died fighting in the war. So fucking sad dude
[2022-12-27 23:58:23] <hot_jake> oh they are just developers that support russian aggression on ukraine in the middle of europe
[2022-12-27 23:58:25] <mc_st0nerr> @klean the time window for errors

[2022-12-27 23:58:50] <siddo__> @hot_jake how do they support russian aggression? by being russian or what
[2022-12-27 23:58:54] <%+SirKapPeela> flipped the script real quick
[2022-12-27 23:58:54] <avaris_gr> at the end of the day this is a product right? let them first put solo queue and see if it is successful. its all i am saying, maybe people like it
[2022-12-27 23:58:59] <%Kitkatzlol> @daz_enners no fucking way, source?

[2022-12-27 23:59:35] <KhaosKommander> Like Ukraine VS Russia lol
[2022-12-27 23:59:46] <count3rnova> nikita has aid on multiple times tarkov is ment to be harsh and hardcore they wont make it easy for solos or for anyone
[2022-12-27 23:59:52] <LuteGoblinz> killing teams as a solo makes you better though, why play solo?
