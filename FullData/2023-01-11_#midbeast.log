[2023-01-11 13:43:47] <+ASAPdvn> TF has had quite a few AP ratio buffs and stuff like that over the last year so it's probably ok to gravitate away from the support RFC type build and go a bit more dmg

[2023-01-11 13:44:35] <boopx2> @jukeboxwastaken ya but i think the best way to do that is make champs cheaper in be so when new players start they can toyaround more with champs letting the find the one ezier instead of them being completly boerd with the 30 champs they have

[2023-01-11 13:45:38] <jukeboxwastaken> @boopx2 very true! I think that's why they allowed you to get all the Champs with the Xbox games pass. which is cheaper than buying all the Champs anyways

[2023-01-11 13:46:01] <MrSluck> @jukeboxwastaken dont think thats permanent tho
[2023-01-11 13:46:09] <jukeboxwastaken> @boopx2 we can never get a complete W. Rito too mean for that
[2023-01-11 13:46:15] <newacccusbannedandforgot> lmao fiora
[2023-01-11 13:46:19] <ApocalypsePlease0> @jukeboxwastaken gamepass only gives you access, you dont own the champs
[2023-01-11 13:46:24] <Dandulf> Nice team

[2023-01-11 13:46:38] <streetje> @jukeboxwastaken i've been playing alot of taliya, but feels like she is so squishy vs. kata

[2023-01-11 13:46:45] <+Adam_Glanza> @jukeboxwastaken you do get chests though which give you shards so its definitely cheaper long term
[2023-01-11 13:46:55] <el_nobbez> @midbeast have you been to the Mt Cootha lookout yet
[2023-01-11 13:47:12] <jukeboxwastaken> @streetje mechanics have to be a little faker like to call Taliyah a counter
[2023-01-11 13:47:26] <espartanodemacrao> how is that champ balanced
[2023-01-11 13:47:39] <+commonpredator> Anything with easy hard cc is good enough vs kata
[2023-01-11 13:47:41] <jukeboxwastaken> @adam_glanza yeah bro, can never get the complete W from Rito
[2023-01-11 13:47:52] <eastsidelb> U do hella dmg
[2023-01-11 13:47:56] <+rmsprowler> why did zeri's bf dump her? because she was always too "zeri"-ous (serious). get it?

[2023-01-11 13:49:34] <+commonpredator> Key to beat kata is or outpush her so she can‚Äôt roam and get kills or make sure she can‚Äôt kill u with good cc. Think malz can do that Idd from around 7
