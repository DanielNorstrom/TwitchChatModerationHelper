[2023-01-08 00:05:02] <%+aamef> These SCAV penalties needs fixing. Penalized for protecting yourself vs rogue player scavs only to receive a 0.1 loss is bullshit.

[2023-01-08 00:47:01] <%ekozaur> My Aeron was built in 2002. I only changed the gas cylinder once. If you have a fear that's too expensive, just remember that it can hold up for 20 years.
[2023-01-08 00:47:03] <jjoker_> bro my desk is a set of draws and my chair is a sofa broke gaming xD
[2023-01-08 00:47:21] <steve_v5ttel> Bro came out the corner bathroom out of nowhere lmao
[2023-01-08 00:47:26] <mugunsux> I eant to know what happened to the faceshielded helmets this wipe cant seem to find any
[2023-01-08 00:47:26] <@%SpottedTango> @ekozaur no fear, I know what they're worth. It's just a lot to have all ready to go!
[2023-01-08 00:47:32] <%$Unarmed_Tadpole> @SpottedTango I got a cheap gaming chair on amazon a year ago and it was life changing for my Old Man Back. just make sure whatever you buy has steel frame construction and is rated for a non-stupidly low weight
[2023-01-08 00:48:05] <%$Unarmed_Tadpole> a lot of the cheap shit online looks slick but if you open the manual it'll say like "rated 125lbs load"
[2023-01-08 00:48:14] <%siddo__> @SpottedTango ive been rocking a 60 buck ikea chair for the past 6 years. probably not the best thing for your back lol

[2023-01-08 00:49:12] <%ekozaur> @SpottedTango if you don't mind the aspect of it, check refurbished sites. They are basically half off (around $500-$600) and because there is no sponge/fabric, it's less of an "icky" factor. I won't post links here, but you can find them I'm sure
[2023-01-08 00:49:31] <@%SpottedTango> I have the costco special managers chair right now. It's better than my last el'cheapo gaming chair from amazon. But I need to get it together and grab something real. H-M is the running for sure.
[2023-01-08 00:49:49] <churrovendor_val> whats with running the paca

[2023-01-08 00:55:41] <%Nasty_Nate91> @playdoob im so bad at the game it doesnt matter what i use lol i just die
[2023-01-08 00:55:49] <cheddarrrrr> @playdoob id say a 6-7, if you get the jump it turns it less
[2023-01-08 00:56:13] <%SparkKMaster> @playdoob That will turn after around 1000h+ at least
[2023-01-08 00:56:22] <Marcus_Helius> having better gear can make you practically invincible against a weaker caliber weapon... or if you pack the best ammo you can shred through the best armour...
[2023-01-08 00:56:28] <%SparkKMaster> But the rewarding feeling is so worth it

[2023-01-08 01:17:47] <%KevinSredz> @SparkKMaster you can just use the Instant Replay that saves the last X minutes+seconds on hotkey
[2023-01-08 01:18:00] <%SparkKMaster> @KevinSredz The most hectic and actiion packed moment, pressiing "Save last 5 miin" is the last thiing on anyones mind
[2023-01-08 01:18:01] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> tarkov feels more broken his wipe than ever and iive palyed since .9
[2023-01-08 01:18:06] <%Ravejeuit> woods best map this wipe i dont no why
[2023-01-08 01:18:36] <%KevinSredz> @SparkKMaster eh. I do it everytime after something interesting happens lol
[2023-01-08 01:18:57] <%SparkKMaster> @KevinSredz I do, explained why I want it back to automated tho... they removed iit because you could tell if you killed a guy if you got a replay saved

[2023-01-08 01:22:06] <deezyyeezy> all headphones or just comtacs? @Klean
[2023-01-08 01:22:18] <%SparkKMaster> @SiiPP I am speaking for myself... what you mean non-exiistent fiights?
[2023-01-08 01:22:20] <@%SamuraiSavv> @f0xxzz Not a PCR but i've shot CZ 75s

[2023-01-08 01:22:22] <tushonkaislife> i agree. miss being able to sneak up on people
[2023-01-08 01:22:28] <@%+Sev07Sniper> Man if Tarkov had Hunt showdowns audio it would bee so good

[2023-01-08 01:23:28] <+Zeitox> miss the sneaking hard
[2023-01-08 01:23:32] <%Ravejeuit> Steam audio 7.5 / 10 patch 13 audio 1.5 / 10
[2023-01-08 01:23:34] [Notification] Royalflushakqj10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2023-01-08 01:23:47] <+SiiPP> directional cues are soooo rough right now
[2023-01-08 01:23:50] <%SparkKMaster> @Ravejeuit Think Steam is based in America, BSG in Russia. You watch the news II reckon? That's why I think they are removing steam audio
[2023-01-08 01:24:00] <%+bobbythebold> it would be dope if prone crawl was almost soundless
[2023-01-08 01:24:00] <%bobthemutant> the new sound problems just make it so you can't sneak. Slow play now requires you to hold perfectly still to play stealthily
[2023-01-08 01:24:18] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @Klean I genuinely like the game more without comtacs but I HAVE to use them to be on a somewhat level field
[2023-01-08 01:24:23] <%f0xxzz> @samuraisavv I don't think too much. think it's just a little smaller for concealed carry
[2023-01-08 01:24:28] <@%+Sev07Sniper> I think it just sounds better
[2023-01-08 01:24:29] <%SparkKMaster> BSG should hire Hunt Showdowns audiio team for a couple months
[2023-01-08 01:24:35] <%Ravejeuit> i dont no man @sparkkmaster  but steam audio was 100 times better
[2023-01-08 01:24:49] <%+bobbythebold> so the headsets really are the difference.. huh
[2023-01-08 01:24:52] <Tie_NZ> meh i reckon remove all comtacs, and the hearing better skills. get the sound working 100% first and keep everyone equal. atleast initially
[2023-01-08 01:24:55] <%+bobbythebold> i'll check out the sound video
[2023-01-08 01:24:57] <deezyyeezy> any communication with bsg about this problem? @Klean
[2023-01-08 01:24:57] <%SparkKMaster> The sound iin that game iis INSANE, can piinpoint players with closed eyes. Never heard anything like it

[2023-01-08 01:25:11] <+thefakegorkzz> the new comtacs?
[2023-01-08 01:25:15] <+ADStrike> petition do  remove comtacs
[2023-01-08 01:25:19] <%+MasonJarrd> so are comtacs also causing some of the audio issues players are complaiing about
[2023-01-08 01:25:19] <+SiiPP> I almost never sprint this wipe because of the audio
[2023-01-08 01:25:21] <%Fiffy__> @Ravejeuit so now they are going with oculus audio so that doesnt really make sense
[2023-01-08 01:25:23] <@%+Sev07Sniper> They are basically the audio version of thermalss
[2023-01-08 01:25:26] <Rojesku> yeah but i think people should be able to hear me through the floor while im crouching at my slowest
[2023-01-08 01:25:29] <%bobthemutant> yeah, some occlusion volumes are fucked. sneaking isn't really viable because you can't rely on people not having comtacs.
[2023-01-08 01:25:33] <Rojesku> shouldn't
[2023-01-08 01:25:35] <%+vinjense> comtac to strong

[2023-01-08 01:25:40] <omzehn> I agree with Klean
[2023-01-08 01:25:46] <%Ravejeuit> people
[2023-01-08 01:25:47] <deezyyeezy> headphones are just to strong
[2023-01-08 01:25:49] <%SparkKMaster> @Ravejeuit But there's a war going... and that's just my theory of why they suddenly dropped steam audio
[2023-01-08 01:26:03] <%+belobeatz> peltors irl are pretty op.  in game is busted tho
[2023-01-08 01:26:04] <@%+Sev07Sniper> I don't think anything needs removing from tarkov. Everythign has a place no matter how OP or how Strong, it should just be rare
[2023-01-08 01:26:30] <+lord_ofthelemmings> wish they just reduced the ambient sound around you

[2023-01-08 02:15:41] <huckwild> super late night early morning streets runs like a dream for me. normal hours its barely playable with the banding
[2023-01-08 02:15:51] <JohnnyMerkem> Is it planned to have a revive if in a knocked out state? I thought Nikita said it would be a thing
[2023-01-08 02:16:22] <@%SamuraiSavv> @succulenthamm Why do you say that

[2023-01-08 02:23:21] <dyaxrist> which fuckin monkey brain at BSG had the bright idea to let player scavs spawn at the start of the raid, cant play streets or interchange without getting swarmed by player scavs within minutes of the raid starting

[2023-01-08 02:23:31] <halebzio> bro i just seen ur vid abt the ADS freelook bug thing, i wish it was just a feature ingame lowkey
[2023-01-08 02:24:12] <%KiIroyishere> @Klean It's true that the LABS neon is really sick, I'd love to get some neons like this
[2023-01-08 02:24:12] <%zGhostface> @succulenthamm yeah, they'd light the guns but keep the low light vibe in the room
[2023-01-08 02:24:23] <+Thynne21> I’ve been playing this game for a year and a half and I have to be honest. It’s easy
[2023-01-08 02:24:23] <Deeman52055> oh thats fun need awareness an a lot in a 4 man you play in one this wipe or you first right now
[2023-01-08 02:24:43] <%+mavvkek> @halebzio ADS FOV should for sure just be a toggle
[2023-01-08 02:24:59] <huckwild> does the map have performance issues or is it server end cuz at different times of the day it runs great others not
[2023-01-08 02:25:02] <%+Nivek_Relyk> seeing the evolution of customs over the years has been awesome too

[2023-01-08 02:25:32] <@%SpottedTango> me too
[2023-01-08 02:25:37] <+emmom> i dont like that you need edge of darkness for coop
[2023-01-08 02:25:48] <%+Nivek_Relyk> would be nice, lighting being the biggest thing
[2023-01-08 02:26:09] <%+ll_DMC_ll> yeah coop should be open to all versions imo
[2023-01-08 02:26:23] <%+ll_DMC_ll> just to help friends learn shit
[2023-01-08 02:26:30] <merw2g> Guys do i have to claim the ,,first" drop to receive second one or i can go sleep and in the morning claim all 4?
[2023-01-08 02:26:45] <%+ll_DMC_ll> use an auto claim extension
[2023-01-08 02:27:01] <%madkeked> How do I aim with a PU scope, above or on the triangle
[2023-01-08 02:27:02] <merw2g> oh gonna look for it thanks
[2023-01-08 02:27:04] <%+ll_DMC_ll> Automatic Twitch works well
[2023-01-08 02:27:04] <@%SpottedTango> interchange has a lot of potential. More extracts (helicopter on the roof like train on reserve maybe?), Fix lights & sounds, expand the outside, rework scav & playerscav spawns and pathing. You got the best map in the game rt.
[2023-01-08 02:27:06] <+mr__matla> @merw2g you need to claim the first one ! but you can install a chrome add that auto claims everything

[2023-01-08 02:40:59] <cptcookedaus> @dek4spt Just play more sneaky and pick your fights when you can, if you don't think youll win let them pass etc.
[2023-01-08 02:41:04] <%The1Electricity> @dek4spt Yeah they also share screen discord and that you know
[2023-01-08 02:41:18] <OGWello> @dek4spt All i do is solo. Very worth it, just need to find your play style. I like to be slow and tactical. People get so demotivated from this game cause of how brutal it can be. Just need to push thru that bro
[2023-01-08 02:41:22] <Vonkv> @dek4spt you need to change your playstyle then if you are constantly running into groups

[2023-01-08 02:42:34] <OGWello> I like to get immersed and play tarkov like im actually my character. Helps a lot with surviving, cause in real life im not going to take bad fights and stay hidden when i can

[2023-01-08 02:47:02] <+michael140203> @D8J_TV all the pmcs spawn at the start and as the raid progresses players can load in as player scavs along with the ais
[2023-01-08 02:47:06] <%+succulenthamm> a set amount of PMCs spawn at start, but people can play as scavs and will the join the raid at random times
[2023-01-08 02:47:15] <Tribodyproblem> @D8J_TV There's a fixed number of PMCs per raid that spawn at the beginning. Player scavs can come like 15 mins into the raid

[2023-01-08 03:44:47] <+RebelFoxtrot> 100% agreed

[2023-01-08 03:44:55] <Halzakk> ima start playing tarkov the way you play it all tactical and shit
[2023-01-08 03:44:59] <+LegaIizeRanch> yeah i think for new players its not as much they want to rat and hear you, they just feel like theyre being heard by everyone constantly
[2023-01-08 03:45:06] <%+aamef> What's even worse is the sounds other players hear YOU make when YOU don't even HEAR it yourself.

[2023-01-08 04:02:36] <%+q_chubs_p> @Klean Yeah, the only think I like more about Dolby is that it gives you a more dynamic EQ, more channels to mess with but my experience is DTS so a lot of that for you. So I agree DTS is great for basically all audio.

[2023-01-08 04:11:51] <%+aamef> 3090 is like butter too on EFT. There isn't a huge difference between the top tier 3000 series cards and 4090 on EFT. But other games sure.

[2023-01-08 04:12:28] <+ChefHall> thats why they dont do so good in 2k

[2023-01-08 04:12:33] <+Divine_wanderer> @Klean some companies are treating them like aio's and routing hoses to an external radiator like you do with a cpu cooler. its the best way to fix the issue with the card being to large

[2023-01-08 13:53:29] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @DoubleOttBuck well, firefights are always the most intense load part in an online game. Your hardware can barely hold the game and suffer during firefights. It's definetly your hardware tho. Lot's of people i know were forced to upgrade to play this wipe. It's surely an optimization issue, but that's the fact.
[2023-01-08 13:53:30] <%darcss> hello blean
[2023-01-08 13:53:31] <rs10rs10> Is this a good poem?: Tarkov, a game that cuts my life in two 🔪 Overwatch can't compare, it's not as true 🙅 In Tarkov, I fight for survival's sake 💀 In Overwatch, it's just a game, no real stakes 🙄 Tarkov's the one, it's my last resort 💔

[2023-01-08 13:55:23] <%darcss> @j4rra there is a fun app called battle buddy made by vertas its helpful
[2023-01-08 13:55:25] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @DoubleOttBuck you're welcome! Try some optimization video, there's plenty on YT. But it'll help you barely manage at least. The truth is that the more we go on, the heavier Tarkov is going to be on hardwares, and it's a shame.
[2023-01-08 13:55:34] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> @Klean I've got a few ideas for it, like bring a rangefinder to streets, have me run at you from like 300m away until you can hear me so we can guage distances

[2023-01-08 13:58:35] <@%+fortburke> Hasnt headsets always been an 'essential' though
[2023-01-08 13:58:44] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> I can't count how many times when Drew and I play together that one of us makes this exact callout: "I HEARD AN ADS" and te dude is like, across the street
[2023-01-08 13:58:58] <SarntRoos> It’s a shame that the coolest game out there has so many issues. I wonder if the full release will still have the problems :/
[2023-01-08 13:59:11] <rs10rs10> is this game smoother and more fluid than say OW2? Like what game offers the more enjoyably gameplay objectively?
[2023-01-08 13:59:18] <ukly0> @SarntRoos probably bur hopefully no
[2023-01-08 13:59:25] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @DoubleOttBuck i'd recommend NOT to upgrade if it's just for Tarkov, but only if Tarkov is your main game.  Either way, CPU+Ram definetly

[2023-01-08 14:03:37] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @DoubleOttBuck Yeah good call. CPU's are expensive as fuck nowadays. Even tho a better CPU is a WIN/WIN upgrade cuz Tarkov is heavily CPU bound. Either way, Ram are way cheaper so start from there.
[2023-01-08 14:03:40] <bert_shoelace> yeah I see the video you made. its insane difference for ambient audio

[2023-01-08 14:30:22] <alanek2011_> no, his voice is very distorted when he gets too close to the mic recently. If you can't hear it you need to listen on something else than razer kraken
[2023-01-08 14:30:27] <Logun_> Is there binaural on or  off?
[2023-01-08 14:30:28] <박올리버나무 (x_quiz)> Is he running on the spot? KEKW

[2023-01-08 14:32:58] <%+ll_DMC_ll> I have a theory though. People are talking about his voice being distorted when he has his stream music on. and he usually plays phonk, which is distorted. So people may be thinking his stream audio is distorted, when in fact its the music he's playing
[2023-01-08 14:33:05] <+Katalyst3o5> Ill help

[2023-01-08 14:59:23] <+mixtapes4coupons> It’s time to buff my 6th sense
[2023-01-08 14:59:26] <LankMasterJ> @Klean do you think all of this audio analysis is also exacerbated by the fact this early in wipe, covert movement levels are low?
[2023-01-08 14:59:28] <%Enti911> yep tactics not using sweat lord bugs within the game
[2023-01-08 14:59:28] <iNooKii> i miss the Dark and darker sound
[2023-01-08 14:59:30] <Synthabilly> The sound is barely occluded or not at all
[2023-01-08 14:59:35] <+goongoblinn> the worst part about is that they made it worse from last wipe
[2023-01-08 14:59:36] <%Ravejeuit> ibterchange is the worst
[2023-01-08 14:59:37] <+xhess93x> Everybody sounds like meal team six right now. lol
[2023-01-08 14:59:51] <Calik0> Don't even open your inventory. LUL
[2023-01-08 14:59:54] <MrEur0pa> @Klean and if you dont move inside you hear player outside better then you wuld be outside and him moving the same spot.
[2023-01-08 14:59:57] <%+Ramboness> @LankMasterJ People barely get your covert levels over 10+ in one wipe so no
[2023-01-08 15:00:01] <%RichyLovy> Everyone is running around with GEISHA WOODEN flippers
[2023-01-08 15:00:03] <ExCAL1BURx_x> so when i was in the raid if i popped a mule would it change the effects of audio ?
[2023-01-08 15:00:04] <%Ravejeuit> extualy the game is not playebel whit this sound
[2023-01-08 15:00:06] <OMFGoddess> @xhess93x KEKLEO
[2023-01-08 15:00:08] <de_charny> @LankMasterJ Its mainly the weight system exacerbates how loud movement sounds are
[2023-01-08 15:00:08] <%Enti911> @klean it's like xray vision but for sound
[2023-01-08 15:00:11] <mediocre23rd> @Klean I would be much more happy when there is no sound at all for slow movement :D that would be dog shit too but way better then this...
[2023-01-08 15:00:15] <%+Dirtymitts> You make a lot of sense Klean
[2023-01-08 15:00:21] <m01Ta> i'm wondering, perhaps they added this 'ability' to make covert movement very silent if you have like 'covert movement skill greater than 10' or something like that...

[2023-01-08 15:00:34] <LankMasterJ> It's funny how this game has the potential to me AMAZING and they can't get the basics right

[2023-01-08 15:00:46] <Synthabilly> That's a good point.
[2023-01-08 15:00:46] <mptyy_> i noticed this a little bit ago and im so glad you guys are bringing this to everyones attention.
[2023-01-08 15:00:47] <12kphil> Ocolus audio is inconsistent af
[2023-01-08 15:00:50] <teeq_010> audio is still a problem in this game
[2023-01-08 15:00:57] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> irl do comtacts amplify sound?
[2023-01-08 15:00:58] <Altoption> Imho the whole headset concept is kinda stupid just even from a game design perspective, like messing with muscle memory by having sensitivity penalties on gear
[2023-01-08 15:01:03] <+goongoblinn> klean just did more audio testing than bsg did in an hour
[2023-01-08 15:01:05] <%Enti911> when it cut out when they both ran @klean
[2023-01-08 15:01:05] <LabMade> I didnt really notice fully until this demonstration
[2023-01-08 15:01:08] <+shai_gg> I don't agree with that overweight shouldn't have sound debuff. It should, but just not that ridicoulus as it is right now.
[2023-01-08 15:01:15] <%+dallasfan315> When I try, and am drunk, I can sneak up on bears and steal their fish.
[2023-01-08 15:01:18] <tsiigaaja> @12kphil It wouldnt be if they implemented it properly

[2023-01-08 15:01:21] <Synthabilly> @DeathlokTheDemolisher They do yeah
[2023-01-08 15:01:22] <MrEur0pa> audio was a problem for YEARS and now its just at the lowest ever been.
[2023-01-08 15:01:23] <%semivild> headset audio is what makes me not play
[2023-01-08 15:01:24] <de_charny> Thats the other end of the problem. If you can hear out to 50m+ you cannot decern how far close a player is. on top of the broken directional audio
[2023-01-08 15:01:32] <m01Ta> @DeathlokTheDemolisher nope, they reduces the sound of gunshots, so you dont get earing issues
[2023-01-08 15:01:36] <szu_the_snake> @DeathlokTheDemolisher certain frequencies. but not THAT much
[2023-01-08 15:01:44] <%+Ramboness> @Altoption same with the recoil, it does everything a shooter game shouldn't do
[2023-01-08 15:01:45] <+xDeltrix> yup, game is a sound whore fest
[2023-01-08 15:01:48] <%RichyLovy> nikita is crying while watching this
[2023-01-08 15:01:59] <%+MTReese_> Yep, it’s happened to me a lot this wipe. Tempeted to not even using comtacs until it’s fixed
[2023-01-08 15:02:09] <%+Dirtymitts> I remember those times
[2023-01-08 15:02:14] <%Ravejeuit> in the garage above you think he is behind you
[2023-01-08 15:02:14] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> i always thought comtacts would hurt your ability to hear footsteps irl
[2023-01-08 15:02:17] <%Enti911> kleanActually
[2023-01-08 15:02:21] <ExCAL1BURx_x> when i was listening to the audio while in raid and from stream i was very surprised at how loud i was, now i know to run light weight lmao
[2023-01-08 15:02:22] <Ghestulsalbatic> yep, i noticed that something is fishy with the sound but couldnt describe it.

[2023-01-08 15:03:09] <CerealKillerDude> @Klean also you being louder because of weight should be at certain thresholds, shouldnt be based on strength level.
[2023-01-08 15:03:16] <+SENIOR_> 100
[2023-01-08 15:03:16] <+pichoto> Would u recommend having oculus on or off?

[2023-01-08 15:03:54] <$510radar> @klean do you know if WLiST items will likely have a check mark when in raid in the future

[2023-01-08 15:04:16] <de_charny> @klean how would you design comtacs/headsets to work so that they balance gameplay and verisimilitude?
[2023-01-08 15:04:30] VIEWERS: 1 455
[2023-01-08 15:04:35] <Synthabilly> Only way you can "be silent" for sure is to not move at all
[2023-01-08 15:04:37] <Renny_UK> So is that with the third party programme that was being tested with Hutch or is that just base game audio?
[2023-01-08 15:04:39] <%+IAMBIGBOY> anyone else have click off screen issues while in raid? baomoteModcheck
[2023-01-08 15:04:46] <DevilFistX> Multiple viewers have noticed slight distortion/over gain on one of your audio channels during your recording of that test just now. Not sure what causes it though @Klean
[2023-01-08 15:05:03] <%semivild> +1
[2023-01-08 15:05:05] <+epixLarious> @Klean How about just simply removing background noises?
[2023-01-08 15:05:18] <xJustPayBacKx> I feel like they should only dampen noise and not increase any sound at all.
[2023-01-08 15:05:19] <CerealKillerDude> @Klean also, you being louder because of weight should be at certain thresholds, shouldnt be based on strength level.
[2023-01-08 15:05:19] <%+gorfy00> yeah, wouldn't go from nothing to loud, comtacs are great IRL, but not magic. xD
[2023-01-08 15:05:19] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> I remember when the selling point of Comtacs was they changed the way gunshots sounded :)
[2023-01-08 15:05:25] <Cacafutimartin> i also notice how much silence there is in contrast with every character sound, headsets could pick up sounds like wind and rain too
[2023-01-08 15:05:36] <DevilFistX> yes, your mic
[2023-01-08 15:05:37] <+pichoto> Sordins do that, Sordins remove a ton of sounds
[2023-01-08 15:05:37] <+xhess93x> As a new player who started after this wipe. This audio has really made me sink or swim when learning the game. lol
[2023-01-08 15:05:41] <박올리버나무 (x_quiz)> Yeah of your mic
[2023-01-08 15:05:42] <LabMade> mic only pretty sure

[2023-01-08 15:06:11] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> @xhess93x i think you should still learn the game. audio is fucked but at least understand the core gameplay for when it does get fixed

[2023-01-08 15:07:21] <+pichoto> @Klean in ur opinion, Is it worth having oculus on or off? I'm having a hard time hiring people :(
[2023-01-08 15:07:22] <teeq_010> @Klean in reserve i cannot hear the difference if its underground or upstairs in the pawn buildings

[2023-01-08 15:07:40] <CerealKillerDude> one more thing, being louder should be at certain weight thresholds, shouldn't be based on strength level @Klean

[2023-01-08 15:09:35] <+Notsofun710> All the maps are using it, isnt it just that they havent adjusted sound locations/occlusion on certain maps?
[2023-01-08 15:09:36] <+LittleFatKid420> @tsiigaaja every map uses the occulus sound. Customs, woods, streets, and factory all have full binaural audio
[2023-01-08 15:09:36] <teeq_010> yea underground fukked reserve up
[2023-01-08 15:09:39] <Wulfgar_RED> I hear same opinion on Shoreline that it was better without resort
[2023-01-08 15:09:44] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> Reserve is the best Scav Map now. Everything above ground is unlooted

[2023-01-08 15:10:11] <tsiigaaja> @LittleFatKid420 I thought so, but I have to disagree - binaural doesnt work at all currently. But the oculus occlusion is in use, yes
[2023-01-08 15:10:16] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> @tsiigaaja they havent added all the proper occlusion zones. i know its not set up for interchange and you can be in the parking garage under the mall and hear everything above you clearly

[2023-01-08 16:01:35] <@%Ring> Fragmentation is like a crit

[2023-01-08 16:01:39] <@%Ring> insanity that it exists
[2023-01-08 16:01:44] <%blakee199> What was the name of Klean headset?
[2023-01-08 16:01:46] <+NihilunV> To this day, taking a shot to the face and seeing the cracks on the shield still makes me piss a little
[2023-01-08 16:01:47] <%KevinSredz> personally I love fragmentation and ricochet
[2023-01-08 16:01:49] <+lilprawn2> hahahaha
[2023-01-08 16:01:54] <Pwnish0r> naaaah we need moar RNGeee
[2023-01-08 16:01:59] <+RebelFoxtrot> 100% it's like a flash KO in a fighting game. Makes no sense.
[2023-01-08 16:02:04] <%darcss> this is a case where the more the better doesn't apply
[2023-01-08 16:02:27] <@%Ring> Crits in my combat simulator Pog
[2023-01-08 16:02:27] <AxCardBoardxBox> I need to find a way to get better at playing solo. I can do fine in sup, trip, or squad but I struggle solo and panic and get filled with anxiety
[2023-01-08 16:02:31] <@%OddBawZ> 7.62 HP does the frag chance even through level 4, btw.
[2023-01-08 16:02:32] <+suhFrenzyy> The last wipe I played was before this one was inertia; did they rework the comtac 2s?
[2023-01-08 16:02:34] <+XL_Beany> is that chance calculated at muzzle exit or impact?
[2023-01-08 16:02:38] <Nugeimi> anyone seen the underbarrel gl yet?
[2023-01-08 16:02:40] <@%OddBawZ> It's really OP right now.

[2023-01-08 16:02:54] <+pebzi> @Klean got 1 shot by sniper scav from factory roof to big red train platform, 1 shot thorax, frag with 762 54r ps
[2023-01-08 16:03:14] <Synthabilly> Oh I can't imagine what kind of damage an HP 7.62 would do IRL
[2023-01-08 16:03:15] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> i think its cool when a ricochet happens and should still be in the game but i think it should be based on how the bullet its a helmet. like the angle. not a RNG
[2023-01-08 16:03:15] <CerealKillerDude> i got one shot with lps from sniper scav
[2023-01-08 16:03:19] <+serial_bus> will BSG ever really be open to criticism / change anything seems like there's a lot of poor changes and its kind of frustrating
[2023-01-08 16:03:20] <rjMalinois> I think ricochet should stay at super shallow angles, but there are some 90 degree bounces that just shouldn't exist
[2023-01-08 16:03:20] <%wubnoxious> pepeJAMMER
[2023-01-08 16:03:25] <%Swako21> pepeD
[2023-01-08 16:03:26] <PopfisDjV2> you have another RGN in your pocket klean you could have naded him
[2023-01-08 16:03:28] <@%Ring> @KevinSredz true but I don't think how fragmentations work in game are how they occur irl
[2023-01-08 16:03:48] <%KlngofGods> I think it would be hard to program real fragmentation
[2023-01-08 16:03:50] <%KevinSredz> @Ring well no. For example, RIP rounds dont fragment at all lol. They just deal raw damag
[2023-01-08 16:03:52] <%+EzPickenz1> is the 308 nozlr any good?
[2023-01-08 16:03:52] <+itsMaverick4TW> @pebzi I had the same thing from Radar on shoreline from the Power sniper scav lol I couldnt even see him shooting at me
[2023-01-08 16:03:54] <EmilGervig> what was it that the audio plugin was called?

[2023-01-08 16:04:07] <msieju> Chat is he on some Quest? or just for fun? or trying to get grenadier Quest?
[2023-01-08 16:04:17] <%KlngofGods> grenadier
[2023-01-08 16:04:23] <birkabork> as a shooter is there a sound or visual clue to let you know your perfect hit turned into a ricochet?
[2023-01-08 16:04:25] <+suhFrenzyy> @msieju grenadier
[2023-01-08 16:04:43] <CerealKillerDude> @Klean do you use windows sonic  for headphones?

[2023-01-08 16:04:45] <Nomicakes> @birkabork Yeah, the person you shot is still standing.
[2023-01-08 16:04:48] <@%Ring> @KevinSredz IRL a bullet that fragments won't deal double the damage upon hitting armor.

[2023-01-08 16:05:03] <+serial_bus> @rjMalinois another technically complicated feature to add that BSG is too incompetent to implement without it breaking the game completely

[2023-01-08 16:05:14] <$RedDemize25> Do you have Binaurul on or off now @Klean ?
[2023-01-08 16:05:20] <birkabork> @KevinSredz lol, ok, but you don't know if they're hacking or something, that could be frustrating
[2023-01-08 16:05:27] <%KevinSredz> @Ring Im aware, but a bullet fragmenting in your body will do considerably more damage than just entering/piercing
[2023-01-08 16:05:31] <%JDoGGsa> played with the new revolver yet?
[2023-01-08 16:05:38] <+oddfellah> should I get EOD as a pleb?
[2023-01-08 16:05:44] <$RedDemize25> Sounds good. thanks
[2023-01-08 16:06:03] <msieju> Will the Underbarrel  work for grenadier Quest or even at All? i had one but before shooting range and never checked it out.
[2023-01-08 16:06:03] <%KevinSredz> Standard gets harder and harder every wipe as the grind gets harder
[2023-01-08 16:06:05] <+LittleFatKid420> @oddfellah having EOD is a game changer, I played for like 2 years with a standard account and could never go back
[2023-01-08 16:06:06] <shaggymanson> you can upgrade
[2023-01-08 16:06:11] <%lord_ubah> it took me until level 14 before I found my first box of matches, been a very interesting wipe
[2023-01-08 16:06:14] <@%Ring> @KevinSredz Ah gotcha that's fair SeemsGood
[2023-01-08 16:06:16] <+RebelFoxtrot> I like upgrading the stash personally but I get it.

[2023-01-08 16:06:21] <0Guest> I'm definitely a pleb, but 1k hours in, I don't regret EOD at all
[2023-01-08 16:06:21] <Soundtechboy> Is there a place I can look at to get the mods you use for Zomboid?
[2023-01-08 16:06:22] <%imCyle> man audio in interchange is crazy weird atm

[2023-01-08 16:06:26] <lj535> I asked here recently about EOD I said I had 3K hours, should I get it, everyone said yes, I dont regret getting it.
[2023-01-08 16:06:28] <+suhFrenzyy> @oddfellah if you like playing EFT without playing with EOD, consider getting it the next wipe around
[2023-01-08 16:06:28] <Its_Trynon> already tried that haha
[2023-01-08 16:06:34] <+suhFrenzyy> the game plays so different

[2023-01-08 16:07:07] <DevilFistX> anyone notice Peacekeepers prices going up and down? like last night the UMP was over $500, and now it is back to $285
[2023-01-08 16:07:13] <MindRUsh_> Thats why I never upgraded to EOD :)
[2023-01-08 16:07:16] <rjMalinois> hopefully that's the case with no-wipe release
[2023-01-08 16:07:27] <Neerlander> @Klean umm im assuming we all start with alpha container at release, what do you think ?
[2023-01-08 16:07:28] <+suhFrenzyy> although, the dailies/weeklies are nice
[2023-01-08 16:07:29] <+Wiekuisty> One thing i hate about EOD is more vendors rep.
[2023-01-08 16:07:31] <+xLESTORxFIENDx> the revenue for battlestate is just too good though.
[2023-01-08 16:07:31] <kangtaum> eod = p2w
[2023-01-08 16:07:32] <de_pressed02> agreed i finally upgraded from standard to eod and its literally like triple the stash space sooo broken
[2023-01-08 16:07:32] <maxxrageous> standard is i hate life version
[2023-01-08 16:07:32] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> as much as i love EOD, i agree. im able to progress so much faster just from sheer stash space
[2023-01-08 16:07:34] <@%GameFreakDP_> well if they do that now, they need to refund every non standard package
[2023-01-08 16:07:37] <Pwnish0r> Gamma is not the problem imo, trader rep is quite unfair
[2023-01-08 16:07:38] <OMFGoddess> that visor is still cracked nice
[2023-01-08 16:07:46] <+agentcallen> @rjMalinois I hope there will be always a wipe
[2023-01-08 16:07:48] <%KevinSredz> a wipe wouldnt get stale 2 months in
[2023-01-08 16:07:49] <+Wiekuisty> @Pwnish0r Indeed
[2023-01-08 16:07:53] <rastafaz> I played through 3 wipes before upgrading to EOD, I kinda liked the exstra work I had to go through to get the upgrades to hideout and stash + trader rep
[2023-01-08 16:07:53] <DaevaRai> While I agree with that, with the constant wipes its a pain in the ass
[2023-01-08 16:08:02] <%Daco1> I can agree wtih that
[2023-01-08 16:08:14] <Zamikaze> a difference between casual vs hardcore player would benefit more the player base
[2023-01-08 16:08:18] <rjMalinois> @rjMalinois supposedly they might do 2 separate instances
[2023-01-08 16:08:20] <+pichoto> people is getting the office kills xD
[2023-01-08 16:08:31] <+GettinRekt_> If the game didnt wipe its player base would be so small and there would be a "meta" way to play that would never change

[2023-01-08 16:09:04] <+GettinRekt_> Wipes keep Tarkov alive. Especially since they dont release content to keep things new and exciting.
[2023-01-08 16:09:07] <+thedenim_> Klean do you think you should get some money back / compensated for insurance if your items are taken ? Would that not align more so with typical insurance ?

[2023-01-08 16:22:25] <+lacr3> Has a realistic feel. That’s what scavs would do
[2023-01-08 16:22:26] <boolin616> I love spawning as a scav, finding a PMC and screaming "HE'S OVER HERE" and a bunch of other player scavs come and we fuck em up lmfao
[2023-01-08 16:22:29] <GhostofCrypto> faction vs faction
[2023-01-08 16:22:30] <+wrong_format> i think its just dying to a swarm of player scavs after youve zero'd out armor and killed a bunch of PMCs and youre overweight that shit sucks

[2023-01-08 16:27:40] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> Just found one of them power mags yesterday. Can't wait to try it out

[2023-01-08 16:28:10] <+Zikane> M1911 also good!
[2023-01-08 16:28:16] <%DeathByVodkaBottle> @Truck_OG car extracts, joint pmc scav extracts, killing pmcs and surviving scav raid. Car extracts and joint extracts have diminishing returns, so goes .25, .14 etc.
[2023-01-08 16:28:38] <ImMickalow> I feel I’m not progressing at all when I play this game
[2023-01-08 16:28:38] <+RandCLR> oh man, i love me some powermag saiga
[2023-01-08 16:28:41] <+glazetrain> Definitely a mental game to use/hear handguns
[2023-01-08 16:28:41] <WelcomeTheValkyries> My grach's have saved me many times already
[2023-01-08 16:28:41] <annual_anteater> I like that you can tag mags, I have scav mags and pmc mags xD
[2023-01-08 16:28:41] <EhceMaple> Thats a good idea if you could actually hear suppressed shots outside of like 80m
[2023-01-08 16:28:44] <tsiigaaja> Ive ran the PB 9x18 for sneaky scav kills
[2023-01-08 16:28:44] <+suhFrenzyy> @Zikane two world wars!
[2023-01-08 16:28:46] <stardaddyq> handguns always make me feel like Jango Fett so I usually always run handguns
[2023-01-08 16:28:50] <frosty103> appreciate the tip :)

[2023-01-08 16:29:35] <jaymcflurry17> faster than emergency reload too?
[2023-01-08 16:29:40] <+Notsofun710> i like to run a glock with the Big stick. my aim sucks so i like the round count

[2023-01-08 16:29:53] <+glazetrain> An AP USP is dirrttyyyyyy
[2023-01-08 16:29:58] <EhceMaple> Pistols would be better if you could swap to them the same speed all the time as if you jammed
[2023-01-08 16:30:04] <jaymcflurry17> good looks good looks, ty
[2023-01-08 16:30:05] <stardaddyq> I really like the 357 rhino for a back up. Makes me feel like a gunslinger
[2023-01-08 16:30:06] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> @Notsofun710 Accuracy by volume
[2023-01-08 16:30:06] <+tacosbad> @Notsofun710 cant go wrong with a big stick
[2023-01-08 16:30:08] <Divi0621> do the Quick Reload by double taping R?
[2023-01-08 16:30:10] <bri4nski> @Klean just tuned back in did you tell chat about the pistol draw speed bonus

[2023-01-08 16:50:02] <+Devil_Ferret> it really is more fun shooting scavs with a bolty than it is reloading the damn thing over and over

[2023-01-08 16:52:54] <iBussin> why cant you put a flashlight on the RFB so dumb

[2023-01-08 16:53:08] <%Sigwada> just wondering are battle rifles any good in this game?
[2023-01-08 16:53:09] <Moon_Man_Miles> tarkov is post-real-world anyways so the economy shouldnt matter
[2023-01-08 16:53:12] <bdill90> Did you have to use D8 quite a while to notice a difference in anxiety?
[2023-01-08 16:53:15] <ItsRajev> hia @Klean

[2023-01-08 16:53:44] <D8J_TV> @bdill90 why would he take me?> Kappa
[2023-01-08 16:53:44] <+Devil_Ferret> lore wise it's also affected by what oppurtunistic arms dealers can smuggle into the area
[2023-01-08 16:53:45] <LabMade> @arogani this is how cannabis should be, free markets. fuck prohibition
[2023-01-08 16:53:45] <kangtaum> also real world values depends on location, like you said m4 goes for 900$ in NA, but here in EU it cost much more
[2023-01-08 16:53:49] <+brokoda> massive head rush from those vapes?

[2023-01-08 16:54:03] <GeneralGangsta> fact
[2023-01-08 16:54:03] <+deweyvi> depends on the strain i find
[2023-01-08 16:54:04] <%wubnoxious> @Booglelele its hemp basically covered in the Farmers Act here in the States. kind of like a grey area
[2023-01-08 16:54:05] <+nutterbird2> fax
[2023-01-08 16:54:08] <+tylerwiththetommy> yeah makes me super paranoid and it sucks
[2023-01-08 16:54:09] <+tacosbad> d8 is pretty legit. In a state without legal THC its as close as you can get
[2023-01-08 16:54:09] <ItsRajev> Yea I suffer from  that @Klean trying to not use now

[2023-01-08 16:54:31] <+roadsidetv> D8 for me make me super sleepy and basically hits a reset on my memory every couple minutes, I'll completely forget what I'm doing in the middle of it

[2023-01-08 16:58:02] <+RebelFoxtrot> I think they've got some serious spaghetti code issues with the audio. They don't know how to fix it without breaking something else.

[2023-01-08 17:00:43] <+JaimeBerlynn> Yo Klean! So the game hasn't implemented vertical game sound dynamics in garages.
[2023-01-08 17:00:49] <tsiigaaja> I think its this wipe

[2023-01-08 17:01:18] <+Accuracy158> We've had comtacs forever though and it used to work but right now crouch walking is about or equally loud to normal walking
[2023-01-08 17:01:21] <DrumPunk100> Is crouch walking ever advantageous or just useless now?

[2023-01-08 17:01:28] <tsiigaaja> @phatraptor Nice conclusion mate... Or maybe BSG didnt implement it properly?  Because steam audio and oculus can sound the same

[2023-01-08 17:01:39] <Pwnish0r> @notvaderr you mean like implementing steam audio? LUL
[2023-01-08 17:01:47] <%skylockcrewgaming> its only started this wipe like it i have had so many probs with sound this wipe only
[2023-01-08 17:01:47] <%wubnoxious> Pog im in
[2023-01-08 17:01:49] <+RebelFoxtrot> I would love to see a proper test with no headsets.
[2023-01-08 17:01:52] <Feltt> That would be awesome

[2023-01-08 17:01:57] <%+BabaYaga0550> I've noticed that issue, i can hear people far away and get confused as to how close they are
[2023-01-08 17:01:58] <Azuriae> We crept on a kitted dude at a airdrop in heavy rain, I was injured and healed while he was like 25m away, I couldn't even hear myself healing in the rain but he approached us and VOIP'd that he heard us and to GTFO :(
[2023-01-08 17:01:58] <LabMade> @notvaderr hunt is so much more simple though, in terms of variability. Its a bad comparison, eft is very in depth
[2023-01-08 17:01:59] <+mall_rats> I wish theyd never added headsets at all
[2023-01-08 17:01:59] <qronis> all of my friends play without headphones cause you just hear everything
[2023-01-08 17:02:04] <wehata> when you are heavy ,so you start stomping like a fat battletank
[2023-01-08 17:02:05] <pineappldev_> real life testing SeemsGood
[2023-01-08 17:02:11] <+PsychodelicSalad> I think itd be awesome if headsets just altered the levels of everything in the game, instead of increasing range of hearing
[2023-01-08 17:02:13] <%+mikennedy_> i think that would make a good youtube vid
[2023-01-08 17:02:13] <+suhFrenzyy> my friends and I are working up to literally do that atm
[2023-01-08 17:02:15] <+phatraptor> @phatraptor oculus should be easier to implement even simpler sum up bsg literally have nfi and are just shit devs

[2023-01-08 17:02:21] <kayc187> should weight affect the way you make noises or would it be enough to just have less stamina.. ?
[2023-01-08 17:02:23] <tsiigaaja> @notvaderr Oculus binaural is capable of being as good as Steam Audio. Just looks like BSG forgot to turn it on LUL
[2023-01-08 17:02:32] <Pentaxia> audio and lighting need a lot of attention going forward..
[2023-01-08 17:02:37] <%excitednewt> not wearing headsets feels so nice but sucks because it puts you at a disadvantage
[2023-01-08 17:02:47] <+notvaderr> @notvaderr ive played both extensively, i dont see how its a bad comparison tbh. the sound in eft has always been ass
[2023-01-08 17:02:50] <lLo0py> agree
[2023-01-08 17:02:50] <%AmoryWars> you and 4 of your viewers vs hutch and 4 of his

[2023-01-08 17:03:00] <01100110_> i also agree that i think multiple ear pros should have just been skipped and we all assumed everyone wears one without equipping it
[2023-01-08 17:03:01] <+Scimitar0> I hate the headsets in this game, but not wearing them is such a disadvantage

[2023-01-08 17:03:41] <+notvaderr> @notvaderr we can hope
[2023-01-08 17:03:48] <huckwild> this game is so much more immersive when you are walking through a map and being stealthy and it feels natural that way but its an advantage to chad and run around pre firing all doors, this is where im torn most with this game
[2023-01-08 17:03:54] <Moon_Man_Miles> id be on board with the weight-noise system but there isnt any 'light gear' like cloaks or real ghillies that allow you to sneak
[2023-01-08 17:03:56] <LabMade> 100%
[2023-01-08 17:04:04] <%wubnoxious> hope audio in arena works LUL

[2023-01-08 17:04:17] <tsiigaaja> @notvaderr @Saro4president Finally someone who knows his shit!  I tested Oculus and Steam Audio side by side in Unity and they are very similiar
[2023-01-08 17:04:20] <MattonixTV> And thats how it should be

[2023-01-08 17:05:01] <TrashlKitten> dont understand why they cant revert the audio to last patches and work on making the new audio better

[2023-01-08 17:05:08] <Moon_Man_Miles> BSG we need a temporary comtac removal!
[2023-01-08 17:05:08] <+Scimitar0> I only not wear a headset because of a helmet with facemask. Which sucks right now because you cant hear shit lol. Someone can be right next to you and can't hear them at all

[2023-01-08 17:05:23] <+Tehfailure> Completely agree, in Veritas' audio video I think it's ridiculous how far away you hear footsteps
[2023-01-08 17:05:34] <tomasjholy> How is it even possible that the game is worse each wipe ? Each wipe all of my friends quick faster and faster
[2023-01-08 17:05:35] <Pwnish0r> speed and audio as well
[2023-01-08 17:05:50] <huckwild> it kinda depends even without coms on some spots of some maps you still hear things for ever away i think the coms just over exaggerate the issue
[2023-01-08 17:06:01] <+Tehfailure> I shouldn't hear someone outside 50 m away stepping. on pavement. I don't hear my neighbors walking around on the sidewalk from inside my house
[2023-01-08 17:06:12] <LilDevil_Ja> @Klean whats with that protect equipment warning anytime a marker is placed. noone rushes you or doesnt alarm anyone. do you think that eventually they are going to implement that or use that warning somehow?
[2023-01-08 17:06:19] <tsiigaaja> The only sound that can be heard from 50m should be gravel

[2023-01-08 17:06:54] <+MashJP> I Heard that the AUG was terrible?
[2023-01-08 17:06:54] <tsiigaaja> too
[2023-01-08 17:06:56] <%Enti911> kleanActually
[2023-01-08 17:07:04] <plsbanmeimtoxic> reminds me of the frostb<te engine. there is sound cutting out a lt in that engine
[2023-01-08 17:07:04] <%sk8nn> hah remember you could spam shift and silent run
[2023-01-08 17:07:09] <+xxghostproxyxx> @MashJP someone capped on you

[2023-01-08 17:07:16] <+suhFrenzyy> does that also affect stuff like when i walk through barbed?
[2023-01-08 17:07:16] <huckwild> im convinced russians just have the hearing level of dogs
[2023-01-08 17:07:16] <lLo0py> definitely not terrible
[2023-01-08 17:07:17] <DrMantisTBaggin> Aug is good at single fire

[2023-01-08 17:07:34] <+suhFrenzyy> i literally can never hear myself or other people hit barbed wire on maps anymore
[2023-01-08 17:07:37] <Pwnish0r> it's in a good position
[2023-01-08 17:07:38] <xenirubia___> kleanBooty
[2023-01-08 17:07:39] <Existhx> adar or aug ?
[2023-01-08 17:07:44] <+suhFrenzyy> i only hear the getting hurt sound
[2023-01-08 17:07:44] <%Lourio> meta guns prolly
[2023-01-08 17:07:47] <xAtticus_> Yeah AUG pops off on single fire
[2023-01-08 17:07:48] <hainesftw> Feels like every wipe, everyone thinks every gun sucks because nobody has maxed recoil control anymore
[2023-01-08 17:07:51] <%wubnoxious> its basically like the SCAR
[2023-01-08 17:07:51] <LabMade> super chad meta is hard to compete with
[2023-01-08 17:07:54] <CheezeMarine> 2 tap to the face is a 2 tap to the face doesn't matter if its aug or the most jacked up m4
[2023-01-08 17:07:54] <%+A17Shifty21A> @klean whats the best Low Buget weapon in Tarkov ?!
[2023-01-08 17:07:58] <Moon_Man_Miles> you use guns bcuz theyre good, i use guns bcuz they look cool, we are not the same
[2023-01-08 17:07:58] <tsiigaaja> @suhFrenzyy I think that sound is completely bugged
[2023-01-08 17:08:07] <+lacr3> Lol Tony hates the AUG
[2023-01-08 17:08:07] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> AUG is a mid tier rifle in the meta. sweats wont use it but i think itll be used pretty often. especially at this time of the wipe
[2023-01-08 17:08:10] <Azuriae> RFB
[2023-01-08 17:08:11] <xAtticus_> I'm an Aussie so I love the AUG haha
[2023-01-08 17:08:13] <JackalsGekko> Since I'm lvl 14 I'm using the AUG A1, it's actually very decent, you can't hold automatic fire, but burst of 4-5 bullets are actually very good.
[2023-01-08 17:08:14] <%wubnoxious> UMP
[2023-01-08 17:08:17] <Zenseiii> Mike said the aug is bad. He might lean towards more meta stuff
[2023-01-08 17:08:22] <huckwild> 545 bp is slapping for now
[2023-01-08 17:08:27] <hainesftw> @A17Shifty21A You can get by running an OP-SKS for a long time for 80% of engagements.

[2023-01-08 17:08:40] <DrumPunk100> Why is BSGs priority adding now content, instead of improving QOL, reducing matchmaking times, etc.?
[2023-01-08 17:08:41] <jaymcflurry17> how does the new underbarrel noobtube work? OP with expensive rounds?
[2023-01-08 17:08:53] <tectonic_nils> Bullpup design has drawbacks, it's good that it's recognized in the game
[2023-01-08 17:08:53] <+suhFrenzyy> @huckwild hard for ppl lvl 1-15 to get 5.45bp

[2023-01-08 17:09:42] <LilDevil_Ja> @Klean whats with that protect equipment warning anytime a marker is placed. noone rushes you or doesnt alarm anyone. do you think that eventually they are going to implement that or use that warning somehow?

[2023-01-08 17:09:44] <D8J_TV> @DrumPunk100 prolly just doing the whold seasonal thing to keep things "fresh". Bungie kinda does the some thing to and is horrendous with fixing bugs.

[2023-01-08 17:21:21] <CerealKillerDude> @Klean that's in close quarters and buildings, but in woods for example, better to have comtacs
[2023-01-08 17:21:30] <tsiigaaja> @Dirtymitts Well done my man

[2023-01-08 17:29:16] <ItsRajev> do com-tacks make your hearing acctually better in real life?
[2023-01-08 17:29:19] <%excitednewt> what would be the fix? just lower the range on comtacs?

[2023-01-08 17:29:32] <+CodyT88> @klean it would be cool if they nerfed comtacs to the same as no ears but also added a slight concussion to shooting unsuppressed a ringing in the ears for a second or 2

[2023-01-08 17:29:42] <Pwnish0r> I also wish footsteps would not sound like a pirate with two wooden legs
[2023-01-08 17:29:45] <mediocre23rd> when u are average player u cant even hide... from chads... silly
[2023-01-08 17:29:45] <Dulius6> With ComTacs IRL youll hear somone chat a pop can across the street but I doubt ull hear somone ADS
[2023-01-08 17:29:52] <dmtpalace> do you squat klean please we need to know
[2023-01-08 17:29:58] <CaptWiiTuHi> Could you say that the average person who wants to pvp and push, that they run no headset? Or take it off once you lock in on a player? @klean
[2023-01-08 17:29:58] <+Matraxxs> Gonna do one with comtacs?
[2023-01-08 17:29:59] <wee_pizza> @yoscar__ But they are really needed for shooting lol, wouldnt make sense to just remove them
[2023-01-08 17:29:59] <%KimorySelkies> what if comtacs required batteries, and batteries for it were rare? might be interesting
[2023-01-08 17:30:00] <+Scimitar0> got it. audio is shit, headsets are shit, no headset is shit
[2023-01-08 17:30:03] <%RollerMobbed> imo for the sake of gameplay, they should make it so it only lowers louder volume sounds. The quieter sounds would only be "louder" because they arent being over powered by the louder stuff
[2023-01-08 17:30:06] <!%SourSweet> that'd be really good fun
[2023-01-08 17:30:13] <!%SourSweet> would open up for some cool encounters

[2023-01-08 17:30:26] <+Introspekt_TV> I wore an amplified headset at the range not long ago and while it was cool how I could hear what people around me were saying, I don't recall having superhuman hearing by any means
[2023-01-08 17:30:28] <lLo0py> @Klean How come you don't use any balaclavas, really?
[2023-01-08 17:30:29] <%RollerMobbed> even though in reality it actually does help you hear things better
[2023-01-08 17:30:36] <%+KARMERICAN> @Klean they should remove the car key jingle jangle from aiming, and then just ditch the weight/sound scaling. rather than have to rework all comtaccs
[2023-01-08 17:30:36] <%+zerodark_met> Can't you bait scavs with voip as well?
[2023-01-08 17:30:38] <%+Hamanschie> @xcraziexm  thx for the sub man

[2023-01-08 17:31:02] <tsiigaaja> I bet they had sound range set high so they could test occlusion easier. Then they forgot to tune it down
[2023-01-08 17:31:09] <%+Landon7K> @SourSweet Love the vids <3

[2023-01-08 17:31:15] <Dulius6> A bit too much TBH
[2023-01-08 17:31:19] <CitsSlate> comtacs irl also cancels out loud sounds, in this game you hear everything

[2023-01-08 17:31:35] <Dulius6> I have comtacs IRL and in game they are a bit overpowered
[2023-01-08 17:31:37] <+RebelFoxtrot> They should just be different EQ's, not boost audio range.
[2023-01-08 17:31:39] <dooby__Snoogans> Turbo sound Mt Dew mode
[2023-01-08 17:31:40] <+TuggManFoo> This is the wipe of the W key pussher is what you're saying.

[2023-01-08 17:31:45] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> Is there a reason you don't equip a melee weapon? Is it in case you find a good one in raid?
[2023-01-08 17:31:51] <Pwnish0r> @CitsSlate aren't they adjustable to some point?
[2023-01-08 17:31:51] <yoscar__> agreed
[2023-01-08 17:31:53] <MrMuckshow> True
[2023-01-08 17:31:53] <topsvop> so you cant sneak anymore?

[2023-01-08 17:31:59] <wee_pizza> @yoscar__ I agree they need a nerf to player movements
[2023-01-08 17:31:59] <smasheuw> is it with all comtacs or only comtac2
[2023-01-08 17:32:06] <+fotsopp3> @klean how many pmc kills?
[2023-01-08 17:32:14] <+eric0_o> I agree with you on the sound. I think its stupid that you can't move whatsoever or they will hear you
[2023-01-08 17:32:16] <+suhFrenzyy> @eolanp going into a raid from like 17:00 will be dark by the time u finish itt
[2023-01-08 17:32:19] <huckwild> now that would be a crazy feature is no discord somehow and only being able to talk in game to communicate and coms allow you to communicate over distance without the whole map hearing you.
[2023-01-08 17:32:22] <buggysalmon> is the aug good
[2023-01-08 17:32:23] <+Introspekt_TV> any headset @smasheuw
[2023-01-08 17:32:24] <%OddsTV> does antique axe weigh less and do more damage? or am i trippin
[2023-01-08 17:32:29] <+sBenger> there should be a "no comtex" challange:)
[2023-01-08 17:32:31] <%RollerMobbed> @topsvop You can but if they are wearing comtacs. they will likely hear you
[2023-01-08 17:32:31] <%Booglelele> i just use the 0.2kg knife
[2023-01-08 17:32:32] <ITIfall> does it works like that irl or not?

[2023-01-08 17:32:43] <tsiigaaja> Or maybe audio is busted and headsets just exaggerate that

[2023-01-08 17:40:09] <+YaBoiShaboigin> @Dulius6 you might be bottlenecked with your CPU. I recently upgraded from a i7-7700k to an i7-13700KF and I gained 50+ fps on all maps due to being bottlenecked
[2023-01-08 17:40:11] <michinoshi> are drops over?

[2023-01-08 17:42:40] <+King_of_Ramen> without it game has horrible frametimes
[2023-01-08 17:42:40] <+suhFrenzyy> @suhFrenzyy no, the smoke is to cover you from people trying to kill you for their Shooter Born in Heaven quest
[2023-01-08 17:42:48] <+suhFrenzyy> but someone else said the smokes don't work just now
[2023-01-08 17:42:50] <Barikkade> so klean do you use 60 or 63 in the end,didnt get that i think KEKW

[2023-01-08 17:46:16] <+Vacheron> i think the big red dot and viewer count offsets it klean ;)
[2023-01-08 17:46:16] <+mall_rats> maybe make the triangle Caution Yellow
[2023-01-08 17:46:17] <+goofie13> need diff colors

[2023-01-08 17:46:20] <%ekozaur> I'd suggest a black & yellow logo, or yellow & black

[2023-01-08 17:46:22] <huckwild> haha\
[2023-01-08 17:46:22] <+BAMTHEBA57ARD> just get a white circle round it aswell might pop more

[2023-01-08 17:46:28] <+rivershenmain> @Klean yes, some people have green circle around it, then you can keep monochrome theme but indicate being online
[2023-01-08 17:46:31] <CaptWiiTuHi> Depends on follow list size I feel like
[2023-01-08 17:46:32] <+BAMTHEBA57ARD> but put notifications on ahah

[2023-01-08 17:47:09] <+suhFrenzyy> its minimal but still has some variance to give it some character still

[2023-01-08 17:50:15] <FlakBaitGaming> @Vacheron Regardless, if you are just looking at quick glance, you may not pick up on the other queues. Or if the person doesnt follow a lot of people and the list is short.

[2023-01-08 17:52:49] <+kris_p_bacon_> If it doesn’t have the grandma operator like 2042 I’m not interested @klean
[2023-01-08 17:52:50] <lj535> three maps shit on 4 maps
[2023-01-08 17:52:50] <Thefabijan> agreed
[2023-01-08 17:52:55] <@%+fortburke> NO BF4 was it!!!
[2023-01-08 17:52:55] <+suhFrenzyy> how come you didn't insure anything?
[2023-01-08 17:52:56] <%ekozaur> I ripped BF3 like a madman
[2023-01-08 17:52:57] <SaintXany> Isn’t battlebit made on the same engine as Mario? LuL
[2023-01-08 17:53:00] <+wizardfight13> god i love bf4
[2023-01-08 17:53:00] <%+MTReese_> I started on Battlefield 3, friggin loved that shit
[2023-01-08 17:53:01] <%23rubel> true, 4 had shit maps and too much gadgets
[2023-01-08 17:53:01] <%OddsTV> @Klean just learned about harsh doorstop. saw its coming out next month, thoughts on that? looks pretty good, but havent seen too much gameplay
[2023-01-08 17:53:03] <ThankYuComeAgain> @RebelFoxtrot So whats the move?
[2023-01-08 17:53:04] <+ripleysdadd> I loved 3 more then 4. Bad Company 2 was peak for me
[2023-01-08 17:53:05] <%+KatDaddy_> @stillforlorn Facts
[2023-01-08 17:53:10] <@%+fortburke> Naaaa BF4 had everything dude!!!
[2023-01-08 17:53:10] <%loraxtreewood> it just occurred to me the younger generation has never gotten to play one of the good battlefields
[2023-01-08 17:53:11] <Overcast22> Aside from naval strike BF4 was so so
[2023-01-08 17:53:13] <+Accuracy158> I'm totally one of those BFBC2 people if we're talking about newer one.
[2023-01-08 17:53:14] <+monkeytrumpetz1> bc2 was the best for me
[2023-01-08 17:53:16] <%+MTReese_> I actually really disliked BF4, it was cool but it didn’t feel like 3 to me
[2023-01-08 17:53:19] <tedwward> bf3 was the game that made me wanna get a pc FeelsStrongMan

[2023-01-08 17:53:40] <lj535> given the state of that game, they are bad devs.,
[2023-01-08 17:53:42] <@%+fortburke> BF4 was the peak not the downfall

[2023-01-08 17:54:01] <+mall_rats> Rush was so fun on BC2 and BF3
[2023-01-08 17:54:04] <+SimplyDebonair> BF4 was fun, but BF3 has a special place in my heart. However... the Vietnam Bad Company 2 DLC was awesome.

[2023-01-08 17:54:47] <dinkledorf55> BF changed after BF1
[2023-01-08 17:54:50] <+ripleysdadd> That's another thing. The destruction stopped being destruction
[2023-01-08 17:54:56] <+DankinWithJesus> the only beta map from any battlefield that I still loved after the beta
[2023-01-08 17:54:58] <Divi0621> the Vietnam Battlefield was lit
[2023-01-08 17:55:07] <%+TheYellaKing> @proyoto no one talks about planet side. It was cool
[2023-01-08 17:55:09] <dinkledorf55> Even BF1 was a little funky and casual
[2023-01-08 17:55:13] <@%+fortburke> Dude remember MAG?!?!

[2023-01-08 17:55:48] <+best_limes> we didnt realize it but we were in an FPS golden age from like 2010 - 2014
[2023-01-08 17:55:53] <2Laxx> the gave us shitfield 2042 when what we really wanted was Bad Co 3
[2023-01-08 17:55:58] <+DS3DGamer> i play 2042 casually, its a good time for small stints imo
[2023-01-08 17:56:15] <dinkledorf55> I also put 200 hours in the first year of BF4 playing solo and it was ass
[2023-01-08 17:56:36] <plsbanmeimtoxic> only fps games i ever loved was stalker because reflexes dont matter an its my kinda slow
[2023-01-08 17:56:37] <%whzky> @best_limes more like 2007 cod 4 was sick

[2023-01-08 17:57:54] <TrinityWarden> Tbh.. most games or at least FPS are kinda bad in their firat 1-2 years after release. Some stay meh and some make it through to the actually playable state.. like EFT. Sure it took a long time and we arent there yet BUT any game has bugs and cheaters nowadays. In that regard, EFT is baaaaallin kleanTeef

[2023-01-08 18:44:23] <+theNerm333> they need to put cases back in the loot pool too. all the other changes make it so the rmt risk is basically gone anyway.

[2023-01-08 18:46:10] <+DankinWithJesus> its usually a few shots it will protect you from
[2023-01-08 18:46:20] <+Yamamoto78> I extract camp from time to time, but it’s not the only thing I do, has to be the right situation
[2023-01-08 18:46:38] <+NtiSociaI> idk if im just having shit luck or what but its crazy how often i get one tapped
[2023-01-08 18:46:41] <%+aamef> @xRydis But if you go out and fight 50 times, you'll learn and eventually be able to win more than you lose. Camping an extract teaches you NOTHING.

[2023-01-08 20:02:36] <bjtc_brian> @ekozaur I don't feel that way nor do I live in an apartment.  But if it was loud like that with just walking around, it would definitely mentally break people.

[2023-01-08 21:42:06] <+Jarred56> @seba_s96 this game seems to be having more of those kinds of issues this wipe. I think its just the state that the game is in combined with your lower pc specs. perfect storm

[2023-01-08 22:13:16] <rabeeh_rokzzzz> I am very afraid to go with 4 or 5 man , because of the sound bug. Any solo player can lurk into the teams very easily
[2023-01-08 22:13:26] <+yolo__baggins> the .45 1911 is a banger this wipe for lvl 1 traders

[2023-01-08 22:14:03] <I_am_kyo_kyo> @lLo0py  pl15 is a nice alrternative

[2023-01-08 22:14:12] <lLo0py> oh yeah, pl-15 is sick NODDERS
[2023-01-08 22:14:24] <lLo0py> but i love the p226 customization and stuff u can do, think it has the most except maybe the glock? but it kinda sucks Sadge
[2023-01-08 22:14:27] <%DestroyerProject> Comtacs just need a nerf, they are too strong, just one of the things that you cant go without even if your using a budget kit
[2023-01-08 22:14:44] <I_am_kyo_kyo> shrimp is great
