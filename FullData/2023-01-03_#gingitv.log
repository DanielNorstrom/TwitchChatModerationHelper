[2023-01-03 15:29:56] <hzwo> thats what im doing, it drops significantly the more targets you chose @jpwastaken_
[2023-01-03 15:30:03] <+tweed_13> shouldnt a healer clear as fast as possible a mate with thunder debuff if he is buffed by thunder?

[2023-01-03 15:30:26] <caughingdonkey> yea healers hate 30% extra healing

[2023-01-03 15:30:47] <caughingdonkey> so to everyone who keeps clearing storming during my burst with 12 seconds left
[2023-01-03 15:30:58] <+jpwastaken_> @hzwo it outperforms every other trinket besides puzzle box and storm eater but storm eater is super unrealistic to use on hunter
[2023-01-03 15:31:11] <%1tapkingg> i think arcane
[2023-01-03 15:31:13] <+sql1010> i guess like arcane shot ?
[2023-01-03 15:31:14] <+jpwastaken_> It can "drop" but it's still top 2-3 trinkets on mm hunter for both ST and AoE
[2023-01-03 15:31:17] <Macc__O> weak auras ?
[2023-01-03 15:31:21] <Ooobubbles> @GingiTV at higher keys like 20 and above, do you think BM with 4 set and bow is better than MM? Or is it just always MM currently?

[2023-01-03 15:33:18] <Qliimaaxx> @tweed_13 You want to clear it as late as possible since the player you clear with also looses the buff, aka less damage. Doesn't matter if you are a healer, dps or tank
[2023-01-03 15:33:55] <caughingdonkey> what u do is stand next to someone, then when it gets low, you run from them and make them chase you forever

[2023-01-03 15:38:41] <Qliimaaxx> @tweed_13 Yea, they both have the same effect on players (the damage increase and makes you immune to root effects), so clearing it as late as posible is the way to go. Then there are some times when you need to clear early cus you gotta spread or whatever :)

[2023-01-03 17:37:28] <headache_04> I Got a hand tier piece and ras bow from vault which should i pick?
[2023-01-03 17:37:30] <873ndj> a trinket saves 35 mins per run XDD
[2023-01-03 17:37:42] <Muttermundharmonika168> @GingiTV Is it possible to get the heroic rasz bow out of the vault? ty
[2023-01-03 17:37:44] <unholyhoit> it takes a ton of valor to upgrade weapons
[2023-01-03 17:37:46] <fat_european0> Yeah, but it eventually gets uncapped. 421 though, i'd always pick
[2023-01-03 17:37:46] <zenniik> Do you know if they will uncap valor at some point?
[2023-01-03 17:37:46] <+fakiife> @BARCON92 when do u get unlimited valor?
[2023-01-03 17:37:47] <%+Skruffy87> when would u use valor to upgrade gear?
[2023-01-03 17:37:53] <Chillcitysnipz> Cap should go away in like 2 weeks
[2023-01-03 17:37:55] <unholyhoit> 415 ye
[2023-01-03 17:37:56] <Tregi> yes
[2023-01-03 17:37:57] <fat_european0> Yeah 415 is max
[2023-01-03 17:38:00] <global_klashinkov> i did more than 40 runs for court of stars trinkit
[2023-01-03 17:38:04] <Zarhyu> @Majuckfu I think you can, a friend looted a heroic version of tier set without killing the boss on heroic
[2023-01-03 17:38:07] <BARCON92> @fakiife not sure, u get extra 750 valor cap every week rn
[2023-01-03 17:38:09] <unholyhoit> at all 2400

[2023-01-03 17:38:19] <fat_european0> ye

[2023-01-03 17:39:14] <fat_european0> HC rasz Is better I think
[2023-01-03 17:39:22] <%+Skruffy87> yeah way better
[2023-01-03 17:39:29] <jeavex> pretty sure normal ras is basically same if not better than 421s lol
[2023-01-03 17:39:39] <873ndj> the equip makes it 10x times better
[2023-01-03 17:39:46] <Izze7> im pretty sure 418 raz bow is better than a 421 gun, the 405 raz bow sims better than the 418 craft for me @GingiTV
[2023-01-03 17:39:48] <%+Franaticcc> sim it, im pretty sure the razageath weapon is like 3k dps or some crazy shit

[2023-01-03 17:41:27] <bzzd_E> @GingiTV what do you think of tome of unstable power for arcane mage btw ?
[2023-01-03 17:41:36] <mutkamak3> can you show your secondary stats?

[2023-01-03 17:41:43] <%+lostlenia> could choose this week a set shoulder, but got last week shoulders with avoidance
[2023-01-03 17:41:46] <%eopti> you could also convert other items than the 5 bonus ones with the catalyst to maybe get better stats
[2023-01-03 17:41:50] <+SivvSins> Don’t tell me what to do @gingitv SMOrc
[2023-01-03 17:42:02] <+Lekanol> we all know blizzard, we have to collect new gear which can be used in the catalyst

[2023-01-03 23:43:01] <KraggHC> @33hinol Yes, all classes are good, it sometimes depends on what spec you're playing though, and it can basically change from month to month in extreme cases, so just play whichever class you think feels the most like your style :)
[2023-01-03 23:43:02] <+korver_> only class that is usually supreme across all specs is mage. streamer is playing arcane but frost does pretty much exact same overall in M+ content
[2023-01-03 23:43:08] <+RWhooopsz> Ofc some classes are bad, if you dont get invs in keys and you are not able to play the game then yes some classes are bad
