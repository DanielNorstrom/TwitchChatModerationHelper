[2022-12-20 08:53:47] <@%+daisy82078> @dieterlaser_ There is a vod
[2022-12-20 08:53:50] <%+FailedVenture69> @Fedorabattlemaster it's just frustrating if I play support it's either a tank or dps diff or both when I play dps I get absolutely no healing so I have to play soldier to heal myself and almost outheal my supports when I press tab and as tank either Hog to heal myself or Dva/winston/doom to jump to healpacks
[2022-12-20 08:54:03] <%+FailedVenture69> @daisy82078 yeah sorry
[2022-12-20 08:54:05] <%mossyyyyyyyyy> I‚Äôm low rank (gold tank) (silver dps) (started at literal bronze 5) but I feel like most games people are trying their best. the best way I‚Äôve found to reduce the really shit games is be friendly and find other people doing they‚Äôre best and start queuing with them. if you‚Äôve got a couple of people really trying there best even if someone‚Äôs throwing it‚Äôs winnable sometimes. just my 2c on the low SR comment
[2022-12-20 08:54:41] <road90210> nerfs weren't that effective

[2022-12-20 08:56:27] <+AGirlCalledJim> @frostjasonvii They decided that DPS shouldn't have stuns
[2022-12-20 08:56:30] <Zeirem> @frostjasonvii it was part of removing CC from the game

[2022-12-20 09:00:26] <%+Anexere> as a soldier play how often should you play sitting behind your tank or going on flanks/high ground?
[2022-12-20 09:00:29] <+MTR__> give cassidy a horse and the character is fixed 100%
[2022-12-20 09:00:32] <+Iccy_H0T> Orisa was all ready really good

[2022-12-20 09:00:43] VIEWERS: 1¬†400
[2022-12-20 09:00:44] <+djeesus> I feel like she needed more damage, but they should of adjusted her tankiness
[2022-12-20 09:00:46] <Fedorabattlemaster> they should give rein a jetpack
[2022-12-20 09:00:47] <road90210> devs never know what they're talking about
[2022-12-20 09:00:47] <MoonwalkingBird> rein is bad
[2022-12-20 09:00:48] <SD_ee> Wait they buffed her recently?
[2022-12-20 09:00:48] <+ZiChaoz> Orisa was not bad at all post buff
[2022-12-20 09:00:49] <Fedorabattlemaster> and let sigma fly
[2022-12-20 09:00:53] <+entertainmebruh> Just go zarya farm grav ez
[2022-12-20 09:00:54] <InfernoDemon_> orisa is good into roadhog, thats probably why
[2022-12-20 09:00:57] <geara_lancer> They should give JQ 500 hp
[2022-12-20 09:00:58] <T3rminatria> I always dominate with orisa, lmao she was not bad LUL
[2022-12-20 09:00:58] <Fazuul> The buffs didn't even affect her survivability.
[2022-12-20 09:01:01] <%+CleinMaster> One guy complained and she got buffed iddKEK
[2022-12-20 09:01:01] <@%+daisy82078> @SD_ee yup
[2022-12-20 09:01:01] <Ski751> @iADQ Think her fall off range is less and now her ult goes through all shields
[2022-12-20 09:01:05] <%+FailedVenture69> Meanwhile they gutted Sombra so hard she doesn't exists anymore :)
[2022-12-20 09:01:06] <+zspade_> prob low pick rate
[2022-12-20 09:01:06] <+inuakurei> Ever since release all I heard from higher mmr players was how bad Orissa was.
[2022-12-20 09:01:08] <+Iccy_H0T> Orisa is also a pretty good hog counter
[2022-12-20 09:01:11] <IBeatsIX> Blizzard used a random hero generator to buff
[2022-12-20 09:01:11] <+SnakeQueen> I heard it was to combat the roadhog meta
[2022-12-20 09:01:12] <scopedog7> they made it seem as though it was to keep roadhog in check while they dont nerf here
[2022-12-20 09:01:21] <Kobiza> buff orisa -> add new orisa skin -> profit
[2022-12-20 09:01:24] <%fatpig1826> her ult can go though shield too isn;t it?
[2022-12-20 09:01:24] <+PR4C71C3> They said she was bad?!?! Lol
[2022-12-20 09:01:32] <%The_Andy_Mac_Show> They buffed her to counter Roadhog since they couldn't adjust him in most recent patch

[2022-12-20 10:03:16] <Phunkadeliic> @iddqd genuine question, when you were playing on stage or having a tough time against another team while playing in front of all the fans what were some devices you may have used to get over nerves or fear of making mistakes while in OWL. Everyone makes mistakes but how were able to bounce back when you are playing on a stage like OWL?

[2022-12-20 12:33:05] <Makoprima> You socialize with other people, you consume media, therefore, social media :)
