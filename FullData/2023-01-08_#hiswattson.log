[2023-01-08 18:33:14] <%sleepy_aries3> @bad3203 some people who are hard stuck in a certain rank (say, diamond for this example) will smurf because they’re hitting a plateau in their skill level and they’re not making it higher or lower. then they repeatedly farm lower lobbies bc they literally can’t make it any higher on their main

[2023-01-08 18:38:00] <Bad3203> @MrBigBadCon its just that the word smurf resonates with me as cheating
[2023-01-08 18:38:02] <jrfiggz> Also, he even says his main reason is bc he loses too many points in his main for it to be fun… he’s playing the same lobbies without the same point loss system

[2023-01-08 18:38:49] <jrfiggz> @bad3203 cheating means there is some unfair advantage… same lobbies, same players, same Watson
[2023-01-08 18:38:57] <jrfiggz> He just doesn’t lose as much rp
[2023-01-08 18:39:03] <MrBigBadCon> @Bad3203 okay well the words you choose matter. the reason people are coming at you is because you said "isnt this literally cheating" which sounds both ignorant and accusatory, so if you're asking genuine questions, you have to phrase things more carefully. no hard feelings
[2023-01-08 18:39:05] <Bad3203> I get it now
[2023-01-08 18:39:12] <@%BESTGlRL> it’s only caused a disturbance bc you’ve repeated yourself 20 times about it

[2023-01-08 18:46:41] <%+chase_intern_jammer> Maybe that seer was just different
[2023-01-08 18:46:43] <!%friedchickentenders> I'll be using the buffed Prowler instead @Squiglez
[2023-01-08 18:46:43] <+moose0003> @Squiglez R99 will likely be more visible

[2023-01-08 18:59:08] <%Hitosherizu> TSM Hal is the greatest player there ever is or will be. His energy is just unmatched. Now that he's on controller it's just insane to see how well TSM is doing again, because of him specifically. I believe that TSM will win ALGS Split 1 and 2 on the back of Hal. #TSMWIN

[2023-01-08 18:59:30] <@%^Nightbot> Honestly, nobody puts in as much work as TSM, they train for hours, and Hal's even working on controller so he can be even better at this game. Verhulst is literally beaming kids with his eyes closed with how much time he's put in on apex. The addition of Reps and Raven to their team just proves that they have a winning mindset and are focused on the grind. With all of this hard work and effort, they can easily secure a top 15 spot in the next ALGS, #TSMWIN

[2023-01-08 19:42:30] <%Hitosherizu> D2 PVP Didn't get "Good" until season 5, and got worse in the last 5-6 seasons... All the top D2 pvpers left to play valo/csgo anyways
[2023-01-08 19:42:31] <CoriSmiff> D2 pvp is way too unbalanced to be considered competitive
[2023-01-08 19:42:31] <drbeamed> Pay to win game tbh
[2023-01-08 19:42:33] <+Skipperdedoo> D2 pvp literally doenst work on a technical level, it uses ghetto af peer 2 peer netcode, you get shot so far around corners its gross

[2023-01-08 20:56:33] <ajjohnson9800> I will never understand how cheating in video games is fun
[2023-01-08 20:56:34] <%BigRobertoDiscordKitten> @notgood3741 I did
[2023-01-08 20:57:03] <VLuigii> @ajjohnson9800 they're mostly cheating to piss people off
[2023-01-08 20:57:07] <%hush_nw> cheating in video games is fun if you're terrible at them and refuse to get any better
[2023-01-08 20:57:11] <spacerocket_> Whats weird to me is that some people actually spend hundreds of dollars to cheat LUL
[2023-01-08 20:57:19] <%hush_nw> can't relate personally
[2023-01-08 20:57:20] <+SamAddams> So does it control your PC with screen share or something? @hiswattson
[2023-01-08 20:57:33] <shesprettyodd> @spacerocket_ there was a dude streaming his cheats last night talking about how much money he spent on all of it lmfao
[2023-01-08 20:57:35] <ajjohnson9800> @vluigii That’s a very sad life they live lol
[2023-01-08 20:57:40] <cody_raves> @SamAddams capture card + obs
[2023-01-08 20:57:46] <shesprettyodd> it was so embarrassing
[2023-01-08 20:57:52] <%adomemphys> monkaGIGA
[2023-01-08 20:57:52] <wiiblaze> @shesprettyodd and how much was it
[2023-01-08 20:58:10] <VLuigii> @ajjohnson9800 unfortunately it'll always be a thing no matter what game you play. People are weird like that
[2023-01-08 20:58:14] <shesprettyodd> he said each account was $35 and he has been through 12
[2023-01-08 20:58:17] <shesprettyodd> and he paid for a month of cheats
[2023-01-08 20:58:22] <+bloozeh> do you know the new Scarz Coach Landon ? @HisWattson
[2023-01-08 20:58:24] <shesprettyodd> so probably quite a bit
[2023-01-08 20:58:26] <+ImJustjuh> no wayyy
[2023-01-08 20:58:29] <cody_raves> @SamAddams check out the "waldo anti cheat" that is being devloped

[2023-01-08 20:58:35] <%TropicTv> So weird I didn’t know people spent hundreds on cheats LUL SeemsGood
[2023-01-08 20:58:59] <%hush_nw> it's braindead easy to hide cheats in this game, if you get banned you're actually just a brick
[2023-01-08 20:59:03] <cody_raves> @TropicTv thats why cheats get made, its about $.
[2023-01-08 20:59:04] <ajjohnson9800> @vluigii Makes it even worse part is they talk crap like it’s their skill being used in the game lol
[2023-01-08 20:59:06] <spacerocket_> @shesprettyodd its kinda sad because its so easy to improve and get good at a game, but apparently these people lack the ability to grow
[2023-01-08 20:59:15] <shesprettyodd> he said he likes to do it because it makes people upset
[2023-01-08 20:59:17] <shesprettyodd> actual sociopath behavior
[2023-01-08 20:59:19] <YashaYZ> @HisWattson  how do you know t this?
[2023-01-08 20:59:35] <+DtSkyy> why do i cheat in apex you ask? my penis is small.
[2023-01-08 20:59:36] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-08 20:59:40] <+cickser> In the future it will only get easier to cheat with new software coming out everyday
[2023-01-08 20:59:47] <kajde2ste> what is his main loadout

[2023-01-08 21:00:02] <ClassyOasis> remember when that FaZe kid streamed Fortnite cheats, got banned forever, and cried on camera

[2023-01-08 21:00:24] <chefvonvorteilspack> @ClassyOasis that was funny as hell
[2023-01-08 21:00:25] <cody_raves> @spacerocket_ people arent determined enough to go to the gym everyday to loose a couple pounds after one month. they want the easy way out even if it costs $$

[2023-01-08 21:00:49] <VLuigii> So many streamers cheat (not saying Wattson). But warzone specifically had a period in time where a new streamer was exposed for cheating like weekly
[2023-01-08 21:00:49] <lelijkeGerard> hello mr hisWattson I hope you are having a good day!!
[2023-01-08 21:00:53] <VLuigii> It's sad really

[2023-01-08 21:01:10] <ajjohnson9800> Can companies not sue the seller of the cheats? Or is it a loophole they use
[2023-01-08 21:01:11] <@%^Nightbot> No.

[2023-01-08 21:02:06] <VLuigii> @ajjohnson9800 It doesn't help...more companies will just form to create cheats since the "main" company is being sued

[2023-01-08 21:03:00] <VLuigii> @ajjohnson9800 it also depends on where the cheats are based from. It could be in a different country that doesn't care for stuff like cheating in a game
