[2023-01-09 19:47:37] <makserolsad> Playing Protection Warrior is the hardest thing in World of Warcraft Dragonflight. It requires a lot of attention to detail and focus. Do I press my Ignore Pain button hard enough or do I need to press it harder? It requires a second monitor to be able to watch a Netflix show in a background while you roll the face on a keyboard while playing the game. Only true and real players can handle the depth of the gameplay of such tank, some people will never understand. Pathetic you all are.

[2023-01-09 19:59:09] <july> Playing Protection Warrior is the hardest thing in World of Warcraft Dragonflight. It requires a lot of attention to detail and focus. Do I press my Ignore Pain button hard enough or do I need to press it harder? It requires a second monitor to be able to watch a Netflix show in a background while you roll the face on a keyboard while playing the game. Only true and real players can handle the depth of the gameplay of such tank, some people will never understand. Pathetic you all are.
