[2022-12-25 03:47:19] <Lukas_Ipsum> tujanga was in boy meets world
[2022-12-25 03:47:19] <%ssdeluxe> It was around 17 years ago when he arrived in these cold, foreign lands. Through that cruel mirror he was sucked into the hands of himself of another world. He even foolishly allowed himself to once again fall in love, even if it was an echo of him.
[2022-12-25 03:47:21] <%mattmk_ll> and i am a strong lad with no weakness like sanity

[2022-12-25 03:49:01] <%$snow_x_fall> space is one of the most confusing battlegrounds you can think of you can be shooting someone in front of you but then someone comes up from under you.

[2022-12-25 03:49:08] <!%socialistOtter> I think a space war implies humanity has spread off the earth, so it's too optimistic
[2022-12-25 03:49:10] <DwarvenCrusader> I thought space war was romancing blue women this is just war crimes and the cold vacuum of space
[2022-12-25 03:49:10] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I could take or leave the war part.
[2022-12-25 03:49:16] <NateMManning> Doom Guy style.
[2022-12-25 03:49:23] <+scumbagpossum> I want to be a simple guardsmen and fight for the Emperor
[2022-12-25 03:49:31] <%$snow_x_fall> most conflict space battle I can think of is the opening to Xenoblade x.
[2022-12-25 03:49:37] <!%socialistOtter> a horrific space war is really too utopian to be realistic

[2022-12-25 04:50:24] <%Quilltaz> Remember how in the first game guns had infinite ammo and then they ”upgraded” them inlore to have ammo clips cuz infinite ammo is obviously worse from a military logistical standpoint

[2022-12-25 05:13:55] <IgnoredKassandra> Even if he is guilty, allowing this kind of torture is essentially admitting there's no point in trying to reform them.  If that's where you're at, why even hold them prisoner?  Just execute them and be done with it.
[2022-12-25 05:13:56] <Sira_6> Maybe they were applying medigel exactly as  much as they hurt him.

[2022-12-25 05:36:12] <!%socialistOtter> if it doesn't have a soul, does it matter if it goes to an afterlife?
[2022-12-25 05:36:27] <%$LoremasterofSotek> Think we have to figure out what the heck souls are/if they truly exist before we worry about the robits
[2022-12-25 05:36:29] <+heftychonkster> We can fix them. That's not a moral statement we could bring them to a mechanic

[2022-12-25 05:36:40] <IgnoredKassandra> I guess it probably depends on whether your God is a jerk or not.  It doesn't have to be one way or another, the big man could just decide to give them souls if they wanted to.

[2022-12-25 05:37:08] <TitansBaneYT> For me, I just think if a robot has free will and thought then I’d say a robot can have a soul.

[2022-12-25 05:53:37] <TitansBaneYT> Nah, space terror ist probably force you to join in a renegade action LUL
[2022-12-25 05:53:45] <+xMrPhilGoodx> @socialistOtter You also find out she has gone through hell and then some, won't go into detail to spoil anything. But she is understandably a walking definition of trauma. A lot of this is missed out on if she isn't romanced.
