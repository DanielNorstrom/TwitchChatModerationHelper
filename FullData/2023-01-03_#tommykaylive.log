[2023-01-03 15:12:49] <f1niee> You can get lords under 100k if they dont have any fiefs.

[2023-01-03 15:46:21] <voltangel14> @TommyKayLIVE the value of converting depends on how much land they have, landless lords can have like 8 men in their clans and just need a castle to be happy
[2023-01-03 15:46:22] <%theTimmysh> LOL
[2023-01-03 15:46:23] <+vaporrwave> which mod is this
[2023-01-03 15:46:23] <ragazzzz> why would you make a landless lord? because you have land and you need lords
[2023-01-03 15:46:23] <cacajjkodo1> @TommyKayLIVE i think that stat count overall garrsion strength too in all castles and towns
[2023-01-03 15:46:25] <!kizelet> it cost millions if they have settlements, if they have no fiefs and their relation is good with u, its way cheaper. @TommyKayLIVE

[2023-01-03 16:03:36] <%+The_Yazoo> Check to see if any of their captured lords are cheap to recruit, not all of them cost millions
[2023-01-03 16:03:41] <%+marty_z12> population in bannerlord would be cool
[2023-01-03 16:03:42] <xunfortunate> but that would be too easy no?
[2023-01-03 16:03:50] <%GrandAdmiralEron> Maybe nobles lose notable popularity for losing battles.

[2023-01-03 16:03:58] <%GrandAdmiralEron> So it's harder to recruit,
[2023-01-03 16:04:02] <%wardenhere> The downside to them making armies so fast is it’s all new recruits. Easier to destroy them

[2023-01-03 16:26:32] <%frankiarrow> Prisoner lords will attempt to escape captivity every 48 hours, their chance of success is dependent on where you are holding them: 5% from within your party, 3% from a town or castle without a Prison Tower, and 0.5% from a town or castle with a Prison Tower (1% in With Fire & Sword).

[2023-01-03 16:42:49] <filamamolo> The function that calculates escape chance has at the denumerator (number of prisoners*power of prisoner) and at the numerator (power of garrison). so more powerfull the escapee the higher the chance/less prisoners lower chance

[2023-01-03 20:44:43] <ablazing_> @maxlevelnerd Currently we are moving towards companies having more power than countries so it would be one company that controls the earth instead of a country
[2023-01-03 20:44:50] <%pootis_poow> I feel like realisticly if an alien comes out into the oppen and the world would be a better place. Racism GONE. Sexism GONE. wars GONE
[2023-01-03 20:45:13] <!%Thewanderingplayer> @pootis_poow Who says that? Aliens might be racist af?
[2023-01-03 20:45:17] <%c0sma23> its not only that its retarded it can get retarded quite fast,like u could have a nice dictatorship at the begining and then it does an 180

[2023-01-03 20:45:34] <%$Kubbaa> yea the alien would just end racism
[2023-01-03 20:45:43] <%pootis_poow> @pootis_poow could be. But if an alien peeps his head out of the white house over all the world would be a better place
[2023-01-03 20:45:44] <The_Balding_strategist> @pootis_poow that is a very optimistic take i think those problem would still exist despite the aliens

[2023-01-03 20:58:36] <%Jarl_Thoman> well if you get JK's skyrim only it overhauls most of skyrim adding ruins and stuff in wide open spaces, changes a few cities ect
[2023-01-03 20:58:46] <%+oldghostfgh> for me they looked more realistic like dawnstar is a small ass village and it shouldnt be

[2023-01-03 21:12:22] <ablazing_> 🤓☝️ eum actually this is the most optimal start for ...
[2023-01-03 21:12:23] <%+oldghostfgh> hey no shitting on restoration its a valid school of magic
[2023-01-03 21:12:29] <%FoxSierra52> light armor is fun because you can move faster, but in early game you take more damage which makes fighting kinda hard sometimes
[2023-01-03 21:12:30] <%TheGolden35> Raging, though you got lots of wolf pelts looks like
[2023-01-03 21:12:47] <gude_thedude> but magic resistance
[2023-01-03 21:12:47] <%$Kubbaa> nerds
[2023-01-03 21:12:54] <!%+Bence9811> but as a human breton is the best

[2023-01-03 21:13:10] <%kevstermates> legacy of the dragonborn is awesome, also gives you more reason to complete everything as you have a place to "showcase" everything you've achieved
[2023-01-03 21:13:18] <gude_thedude> you can get almost immune to magic as a breton with their perk

[2023-01-03 21:27:13] <GrimeyTune> always go mage
[2023-01-03 21:27:27] <%+lil_adosan> spellblade
[2023-01-03 21:27:34] <%+black_death00> mage with really good magic mods is amazing

[2023-01-03 21:29:17] <ablazing_> Poison either doenst do anything or it does a milion dmg if you abuse that alchemy bug
[2023-01-03 21:29:21] <@%+wolfpoops> its a viable class

[2023-01-03 21:29:38] <%Jarl_Thoman> i remember a mod for skyrim 2013 version called Pirates of Skyrim and Northern cardinal, it was a pirate mod for skyrim, it was so fun
[2023-01-03 21:29:46] <%+lil_adosan> i feel like stealth archer is the most basic skyrim class
[2023-01-03 21:29:47] <!%+Bence9811> as far as i know in the base game only archery has dot dmg by poisoning the arrows
[2023-01-03 21:29:48] <%Jarl_Thoman> shame it was never ported
