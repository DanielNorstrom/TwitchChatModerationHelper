[2022-12-20 09:39:05] <%Zirconix> Any good home insurance policy should include cover for burst pipes and water leaks as standard. In fact, it’s one of the most common reasons for home insurance payouts in the UK – according to the Association of British Insurers, providers pay out £2 million for burst pipes and water leaks every day.

[2022-12-20 09:46:16] <Ducklettz> you can dry out most electrical equipment with a hairdryer
[2022-12-20 09:46:16] <%$TrowGundam> Ehh, that stuff is in plastic bags, packaging might be ruined, but the card should be fine

[2022-12-20 09:46:20] <Pixiemix> It's the thought that counts
[2022-12-20 09:46:21] <%PvtHudson093> arnt they usually wrapped in anti static bags
[2022-12-20 09:46:23] <emoalll> Preach are you not at the World First Race ?
[2022-12-20 09:46:24] <+NixxyAI> @Wrenton aw right :( if it was shutdown you could just let it dry out a week or so and it would be OK
[2022-12-20 09:46:25] <Sarconick> can it get refunded after the flood ?
[2022-12-20 09:46:25] <%Freki42> @Preachlfw you made him happy anyways.
[2022-12-20 09:46:30] <hadoukyn> how big was that flood wtf
[2022-12-20 09:46:31] <Knups> they are usually seal up pretty tight in plastic. hopefully its ok
[2022-12-20 09:46:36] <seattlecoffee> Insurance? Building taking care of it?
[2022-12-20 09:46:41] <afreak10> depends on how good was the packaging
[2022-12-20 09:46:42] <%Hupu_a> if it was inside the package it might be ok since they are wrapped in blastic COPIUM

[2022-12-20 09:55:32] <zenkodac> the team production of echo was alays better then liquid or complexity when it was that, normaly only maxes stream is over the echo one

[2022-12-20 09:56:20] <THECooja> there's honestly a massive difference in the quality of Echo's production and casters vs everyone else. both Liquid and Method productions don't get anywhere close to this quality
[2022-12-20 09:56:20] <zenkodac> yea 100% your bants with jeath just makes it really understandable
[2022-12-20 09:56:21] <%maplelost> feels liike every caster so far is a hype caster LUL

[2022-12-20 10:03:14] <%0acht> I think the add phase needs to be nerfed. There is no way the shields are breaking even after the reset
[2022-12-20 10:03:15] <zenkodac> it all depends on how much power they get with the reset
[2022-12-20 10:03:16] <%+Sintry123> It's mathematically impossible rn. THey sent 18 people to one side and couldn't break the shield
[2022-12-20 10:03:17] <%+SchwarzStork> they need reset gear 100%
[2022-12-20 10:03:19] <%+Morkid> My money's on early next reset
[2022-12-20 10:03:19] <xFastidiousx> a WoW raid has never trumped the importance of Christmas, even after all these years

[2022-12-20 10:03:20] <%+SupoxFlytrap> gonna be hard for it to die before christmas unless they nerf the hell out of it

[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <%ばかです (baka4real)> @preachlfw this would be water damage not flood, you should double check with the insurance team
[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <Ducklettz> Surely the damage will be reimbursed?
[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <Lamadar> This is not Flood Insurance, this is building owner fuckup
[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <Moocifur> holy shit
[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <%+OrdinaryOlly> @Preachlfw its not flood protection you need, its water pipe insurance so maybe its covered?

[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <Achny01> What kinda bs is it that this counts as flood
[2022-12-20 10:08:26] <@%+HannatsCorner> @preachlfw it is covered under base insurance due to it being pipes
[2022-12-20 10:08:27] <+SaikoS7ven> how did it get flooded?

[2022-12-20 10:08:29] <%+epicspacebears> @traveler_103 this is on the landlords side as Chris has said.
[2022-12-20 10:08:31] <%+Malkalen> This isn't a flood though, flood's refer to ris8ing water not a burst pipe
[2022-12-20 10:08:32] <+Hellnolf> as someone who works in insurance, this isnt a flood. this is en escape of water, you should be covered.

[2022-12-20 10:08:41] <%+Sintry123> It's not a flood though. A flood would imply act of god or some other sort of water overflow. It's general insurance due to pipe damage

[2022-12-20 10:11:59] <FelicitySmoak> 'flood insurance' doesn't seem to cover burst pipes from what i'm googling, should be covered under generic insurance
[2022-12-20 10:12:00] <MrsPreachcon2017> 😭😭😢😢
[2022-12-20 10:12:01] <%Dragonnan> Hello there lovelyfaces, missed you all <3

[2022-12-20 10:12:05] <%+manthelazy> @Cara1977 omh hi!!
[2022-12-20 10:12:05] <%0acht> @birdnorf Brits have water tanks under the roof for some reason...
[2022-12-20 10:12:05] <%+Impurite> @weertangel I was being pithy. I didn't think you didn't understand water moon2S It's basically water + time though.
[2022-12-20 10:12:07] <%Marach> @ein_sof93 probably on the buildings roof
[2022-12-20 10:12:07] <%rekr3> @ChunkeyNinja Hopefully that is a short list and not a short list of what's not been damaged.
[2022-12-20 10:12:07] <Nifona> @birdnorf it's unsually cold in the UK compared to UK standards
[2022-12-20 10:12:08] <%kuuhaku08> ah i see, truly a Sadge moment

[2022-12-20 10:12:20] <%+Wenlocke> @birdnorf it was that cold here end of last week. With the offices empty for the weekend, nobody will have been running teh heating
[2022-12-20 10:12:21] <%Vinestra28> @Succath No flood insurance for a 2nd story office
[2022-12-20 10:12:23] <zabroom> it's been so damn cold, I'm not surprised some pipes have frozen. fucking sucks still
[2022-12-20 10:12:25] <%OldRavyn> @kuuhaku08 100% Sadge / PepeHands moment
[2022-12-20 10:12:29] <%KrazeBee> If the water flow is strong enough it just spreads throughout the attic before slowly seeping down the walls/ceiling
[2022-12-20 10:12:31] <+weertangel> i hope i can donate at least a little to ofset some of the damage that coused, couse for a company like Preach's its catastropic.
[2022-12-20 10:12:31] <+SaikoS7ven> did the roof break or something?? i
[2022-12-20 10:12:34] <%+Zargnof> knowing most insurance companies though they are gonig to try something to get out of paying. Scum

[2022-12-20 10:12:47] <%maplelost> Won't they need to tear down the drywall and everything incase of mold? Sounds like its gonna be a long time before they can move back in
[2022-12-20 10:12:48] <Maliysa> maybe tge landlord has so e sort of insurance?
[2022-12-20 10:12:55] <+hollijain> To all of Team Preach, I’m so so sorry. I’ve been watching you build the office and this must be absolutely devastating for you all
[2022-12-20 10:12:56] <%+justin2112> @ChunkeyNinja that fuckin sucks mate best of luck getting it sorted and always talk with insurance
[2022-12-20 10:12:56] <%+ein_sof93> @dktrj ah ok that's nuts you would think the rough would be well made enough for it to spill off but I know nothing about this kinda thing idk

[2022-12-20 10:13:04] <+Kappy_AU> @maplelost yeah, months out of action for sure
[2022-12-20 10:13:04] <@%ChunkeyNinja> the building itself is is covered since we're renting, but contents is unclear atm
[2022-12-20 10:13:05] <%Cara1977> not flood, water damage covered under contents insurance includes pipe bursting
[2022-12-20 10:13:06] <%+toobored> @chunkeyninja make sure the main switch is off

[2022-12-20 10:13:16] <+Mitune> oh no @MrsPreachcon2017
[2022-12-20 10:13:16] <@%+HannatsCorner> @toobored it is most likely shutoff at the main breaker
[2022-12-20 10:13:17] <%Lithirrdys> not an expert, but im sure burst pipes are covered under the kind of standard contents insurance, but yeah this truely sucks
[2022-12-20 10:13:19] <%$TrowGundam> Do they have like Renter's Insurance? I know my renter's insurance covers things like damage from burst pipes and stuff like that.

[2022-12-20 10:13:50] <%equipbasicsword> Man, so sorry to hear @MrsPreachcon2017 @Preachlfw @ChunkeyNinja
[2022-12-20 10:13:51] <%+DktrJ> @ein_sof93 Tank is internal to the building, not sitting on top. So when pipes go, you have a super large volume of water contained within the shell of the building
[2022-12-20 10:13:57] <+NeekTheNook> or at least the easily replaceable things, as thats their responsibility
[2022-12-20 10:14:03] <+weertangel> @Impurite if they discovered it to late then yes, its indeed possible, i myself had a leak at home and was able to cut it off in time,thought he neighbors below me still got some water in their house. But this looks like no one noticed untill a day later.
