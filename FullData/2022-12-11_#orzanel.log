For more experienced players/good players the previous tanks also apply + Su-130, Skopion G, Progetto, ShPtk,Object 274a for grinding credits. Other OP premiums that suck at moneymaking can be Chrysler, Skoda T56, Bourrasque. For Light Tanks, M41 GF and LT432.

[2022-12-11 10:11:18] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.
[2022-12-11 10:11:37] <@%mdc5000> I like the E50m
[2022-12-11 10:11:40] <@%$superreiska> Today is a special day so 500 copper gets you a tank request YEP

[2022-12-11 13:33:07] <@^Nightbot> Very fun derp tank, amazing dispersion on the move like borrasque, bad aimtime but it doesn't matter since you can just point and shoot, amazing velocity on the hesh shells so it's accurate, bad top speed, very good traverse speed, trollish armor so it might bounce some shots, it's a bully for paper tanks. Overall a nice derp!

[2022-12-11 14:06:26] <hannibalbonapart> i'd love this tank would fit my playstyle, its more like a paper medium which i like and i desperately need a second good prem tank, only got borrat

[2022-12-11 14:07:39] <@%mdc5000> Indeed,people that complaign about 15-5 games should play WT for a while and see its the same regardless of the game .
[2022-12-11 14:07:39] <fmvgomes> u can imagine how the gaming expewrience went

[2022-12-11 14:11:35] <joe1944eu> Hi Orzanel, which tank do you recommend to get better at the game? Which class/tier? A tank to stay with for a while to learn? Thanks!
[2022-12-11 14:11:43] <fmvgomes> !new
[2022-12-11 14:11:44] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics
[2022-12-11 14:12:00] <%wims80> do people still use xvm these days?
[2022-12-11 14:12:16] <redgreyhound> @mdc5000 do you have the AEC MK II in wt?

[2022-12-11 14:17:39] <!$btesla> It's nothing to do with life, it's only a game, nothing else, it's supposed to be a relaxation and not to determine your life style...if the game getting to interfere with your real life now that is a big issue my friend! ;) @Orzanel
[2022-12-11 14:17:53] <%MomixBoyToy69> @stevie__ray_vaughan hola kind sir orzPog
[2022-12-11 14:17:59] <srki_fall1n1> Haha i understand what you‚Äôre saying and i agree but i heres an example from this morning: i do 5,5 k dmg with renegade with 3 kills and we lose 15:6 and you‚Äôre suggesting that it‚Äôs my fault for not killing whole enemy team
[2022-12-11 14:18:05] <srki_fall1n1> Ok
[2022-12-11 14:18:10] <srki_fall1n1> My bad then

[2022-12-11 14:19:14] <akseee45> @srki_fall1n1 you propably got most of the damage while baiting your team to death so you need to get the damage done when it matters
[2022-12-11 14:19:15] <+Mmonstrul> hey Orzy, did you buy any upgrade for the dog, Chaffee, are there any bonuses to get ? or is it purely cosmetic ?

[2022-12-11 15:03:43] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.

[2022-12-11 15:34:25] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.
