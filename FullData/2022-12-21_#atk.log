[2022-12-21 16:39:23] <@%+Shikiro> @MRxVIKO It's only more expensive because there's a much higher demand for support accessories that are already expensive
[2022-12-21 16:39:25] <%lostsoulz1010> Gonna be more expensive on release cause high demand

[2022-12-21 18:26:39] <+shypandy> i mean i quit lost ark cause its so boring i just wanted artist since the game came out and yeah, well
[2022-12-21 18:26:40] <mmayhem7> issue is less about changes but more about how BAD amazon changes are, like the ugly replacement faces/hairs that nobody uses, removing legendary skins entirely, shadowhunter graphics, etc
[2022-12-21 18:26:40] <+Uncle_Druidus> not be a year behind constantly
[2022-12-21 18:26:47] <@%+Shikiro> wait when did aeromancer come out?
[2022-12-21 18:26:49] <+Uncle_Druidus> wheres the fun in knowing literally everything you get a year in advance

[2022-12-21 18:26:56] <%+Gr1ffyx> idk if Zeals is purposely being ignorant, we wouldn't care if it takes longer if we were caught up
[2022-12-21 18:26:58] <mmayhem7> ags changes tend to be very low effort and jarring

[2022-12-21 18:27:10] <pepegalos> @shypandy if the game is boring for u why u care about a class Dentge
[2022-12-21 18:27:18] <+DevuIge> @mmayhem7 Amazon doesn’t make the changes, smilegate does, Amazon just hosts their game
[2022-12-21 18:27:21] <@%+Shikiro> oh it's been like 6-7 months
[2022-12-21 18:27:23] <+shypandy> @shypandy ? cause the calss looks fun
[2022-12-21 18:27:26] <%killuazan> @Uncle_Druidus we will never be on par with kr, simple reason: the time they take to make the build for na takesa round 6 months, so technically we will always be 6 months late from kr
[2022-12-21 18:27:31] <%+deadlypants112> new classes in a game where only 6 are effective and getting a new class at content is bad af and atkDes
[2022-12-21 18:27:34] <summaknotts> @Uncle_Druidus we cant catch up, its honestly for the best that we dont, "catching up" is the sole reason for lost ark burnout for the west
[2022-12-21 18:27:40] <Kluzien> i swear this game lives rent free in so many people's heads that don't even play it

[2022-12-21 18:28:27] <mmayhem7> @DevuIge then its smilegate giving 0 effort to these changes for a bad outcome
[2022-12-21 18:28:45] <summaknotts> why are they making more dps classes when there should be a new support to make the role more enticing
[2022-12-21 18:28:56] <%killuazan> @Nozerkg I hope they released with skins that they serve there lore purpose
[2022-12-21 18:29:14] <@%+Shikiro> @summaknotts because dps classes make more money probably
[2022-12-21 18:29:18] <%Vyse_Hex> @shypandy holy tf this guy Denting
[2022-12-21 18:29:29] <@%+Shikiro> or maybe they have some revamps in mind to help
[2022-12-21 18:29:38] <Nozerkg> @killuazan Hopefully so, yeah. I was thinking of that aswell. Would they release skins like in bulk, to catch up? or just the normal way. Hmmm

[2022-12-21 18:30:04] <+shypandy> @shypandy ? this game is boring and repetetive
[2022-12-21 18:30:07] <summaknotts> @summaknotts thats true, lots of holes in the game but as some content creators said, "its not my job to figure out the game, im just a player"
[2022-12-21 18:30:08] <%killuazan> @ATK Do you have an artist interview on the thinking or can you suggest someone to look in to it since I'm changing to artist as my main.

[2022-12-21 18:42:28] <+cosmos_reaves> yeah brel in april is good 100%

[2022-12-21 18:42:47] <+dani949> yeah artist is sadge but brel is definitely gonna be a long climb. tried g2 but still couldn't clear

[2022-12-21 18:43:02] <fedtothelolis> im pretty sure the main reason people are upset is because we have to wait 4 months for artist, releasing her earlier would also alleviate some support shortage, hopegully
[2022-12-21 18:43:08] <iloverice18> brel in april is good timing imo it's just the class cadence  Smoge

[2022-12-21 20:29:47] <OverpoweredOW> thats true but isn't the end goal to be 1:1 with kr? or is that not the case
[2022-12-21 20:29:56] <%+er_buffalo> Its already hard to find party's at anything lower than valtan
[2022-12-21 20:30:01] <Fatamerikans> @OverpoweredOW nope

[2022-12-21 20:30:21] <%+arcanegast> Im okay with everything besides class release schedule
[2022-12-21 20:30:23] <%buttlerfredrick> they said at least 3-6 months behind
[2022-12-21 20:30:25] <+Uncle_Druidus> everyone who plays the game wants it
[2022-12-21 20:30:26] <saichotic_> ^
[2022-12-21 20:30:33] <saichotic_> its always gonna be 3-6 months behind
[2022-12-21 20:30:35] <frm_da_bush> @OverpoweredOW probably more like 3 months behind KR

[2022-12-21 20:30:37] <+Uncle_Druidus> but ags legit said we'll always be several months behind

[2022-12-21 20:30:43] <maelfamous> @OverpoweredOW no in the best case the west version will be 6 months late

[2022-12-21 20:31:05] <Junichi8369> NA wants to catch up. but dont realize the dead times between updates that will occur once we catch up. you think they crying now? wait til we have to wait 6months - a year for content
[2022-12-21 20:31:06] <+ObsoleteThree> I would rather have them delayed Brelz so it didn't come out when WoW Raid

[2022-12-21 20:31:40] <%+Gr1ffyx> right, as long as they don't go back on that I'm fine with however they pace us
[2022-12-21 20:31:49] <%+Gr1ffyx> but it seems like they are planning on keeping us behind forever now
[2022-12-21 20:32:01] <perrrmaaa> I feel like there will always be atleast one month delay before NA gets the patches from korea.
[2022-12-21 20:32:03] <Junichi8369> we should be behind all the time
[2022-12-21 20:32:08] <%+lGimmeNameChangedl> @locomash So you wouldnt be mad if they didnt release content at all?
[2022-12-21 20:32:29] <locomash> argos valtan vykas clown brel,  we got contnent

[2022-12-21 20:33:29] <locomash> i took KR like 4 years for brell, it took us 1 year
[2022-12-21 20:33:31] <saichotic_> im curious if theres any korean mmo on the market that has their global counterpart caught up 1:1

[2022-12-21 20:33:58] <%imkai__> he said he will finish it by Christmas
[2022-12-21 20:33:58] <+sll1y> he said hell try to hit max again in 3 days
[2022-12-21 20:34:09] <%+lGimmeNameChangedl> @Junichi8369 Just more curious why hold artist till April though? Why not release it February or 3rd week of January. I want to have more supports then I have for dps.
[2022-12-21 20:34:17] <%+lGimmeNameChangedl> That is my main quip with holding content for awhile

[2022-12-21 20:34:58] <sintiadaria9> I think having this 4 months breaks also allows new players to catch up
[2022-12-21 20:35:04] <%+arcanegast> I only want classes faster not content

[2022-12-21 20:35:22] <+lazyhoar> west andys have it
[2022-12-21 20:35:26] <Canidae5> the highest i've seen in game was like 1540
[2022-12-21 20:35:33] <%+er_buffalo> What they are thinking is we will get a massive honing nerf and power passes to get to that level since we would be in "catch up" mode but we are not going to get that
[2022-12-21 20:35:36] <Valkyrion89> @Junichi8369 yeah they release with brel hard so you swipe hard to get the artist ready for brel hard.
[2022-12-21 20:35:36] <%+Gr1ffyx> I've seen 1 1575 in my life it was wild
[2022-12-21 20:35:36] <%imkai__> My group only has one at 1575; everyone else was 1520-1530

[2022-12-21 20:35:55] <+sll1y> only 1575s are gigawhales, there's a few in NAW but not many
[2022-12-21 20:36:04] <%+Soft_tofu318> we dont even have api to check. their argument isnt even based on data. it is based on feeling
[2022-12-21 20:36:04] <maelfamous> I saw like 1 or 2 1575 but I see way more 1500- than 1500+
[2022-12-21 20:36:06] <Canidae5> i feel like 1575 zerkers don't count
[2022-12-21 20:36:08] <sopamaruchanvencido> i saw brel 1575 4/8 party
[2022-12-21 20:36:10] <Canidae5> zerkers in NA are weird

[2022-12-21 20:36:24] <+shank_qt> The point is I don't want to "catch up". I have a roster of 8 alts, I'm disapointed Artist has been delayed. It seems pushed back for the Lost Ark anniversariy
[2022-12-21 20:36:30] <epik168> 1575 it like a saw once in 2 month and he can't even do vykas orb

[2022-12-21 21:01:22] <%+er_buffalo> @heakr I hate to see that too and agree with you but i think they are just trying to get fast party's to try to finish more dailys or alt raids and not be slowed down by "lower level noobs" or something like that. Personally i also help with learners as much as i can and think that is the best way to keep from getting trolled in the future and keep a healthy community by helping others learn and not gatekeeping

[2022-12-21 21:03:17] <Kluzien> @LZ96 if you are in a party of 1490s another 1490 won't make it any faster
[2022-12-21 21:03:20] <terribletimber> @yoohyeonisn how they caused wipe? party not stacked enough to fast clear?
[2022-12-21 21:03:26] <%heakr> well they are a mokoko what did you expect LuL @yoohyeonisn
[2022-12-21 21:03:26] <%+lGimmeNameChangedl> @heakr Dont get me wrong buts it sort of discouraging when you are at the point of 1460 and not getting into parties. I know they are tryna to get their hw done cus it do be taking a hot minute to complete some of the raids.
[2022-12-21 21:03:47] <%yoohyeonisn> you know raid wipe mech?
[2022-12-21 21:03:53] <%+er_buffalo> @heakr Same i do valtan at least 7 times a week and if i have time i work in more alts ( i have 18 characters) im not a learner either but i like helping in learner partys to try to help ppl learn and get better so they can end up joining those high level raids

[2022-12-21 21:09:00] <%+LZ96> dont think i ever had problems not able to finish valtan or dying in ghost mode on my rosters of 1490s
[2022-12-21 21:09:11] <%+LZ96> without balthor
[2022-12-21 21:09:13] <%+lGimmeNameChangedl> @heakr Yeah the worst part is once you reach 1430, and need to do vykussy. You barely get that many wings, I think 6-7 wings from NM and you need good amount. That is like 3-4 resets to get your gear once you reach 1445. That is if you dont push to 1460 to do HM instead to get 12 or more... that would be like 2-3 resets maybe less.
