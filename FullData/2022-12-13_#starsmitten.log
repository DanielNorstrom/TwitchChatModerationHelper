[2022-12-13 23:28:18] <%totallynotahealermain> do you want some tips from what i noticed?
[2022-12-13 23:28:51] <%totallynotahealermain> swipe also gives a combo point
[2022-12-13 23:28:54] <%totallynotahealermain> but you dont have it talented
[2022-12-13 23:29:03] <%totallynotahealermain> thrash leaves a dot and costs more energy
[2022-12-13 23:29:07] <Limdaer> thrash applies dot, swipe does more dmg
[2022-12-13 23:29:07] <%totallynotahealermain> i think FeelsDankMan
[2022-12-13 23:29:09] <%Sisleyx> Swipe is what you use in big aoe. Thash shoudl only be used one to leave a dot
[2022-12-13 23:29:31] <%totallynotahealermain> even then swipe is only used after you spread moonfire
[2022-12-13 23:29:47] <%totallynotahealermain> moonfire spread + sunfire does more damage than sunfire + swipe spam
