[2023-01-06 06:10:53] <!%BasilWoof> this is my personal theory
[2023-01-06 06:11:01] <!%BasilWoof> but I think Twitch is lenient with the art category
[2023-01-06 06:11:02] <+Im_Shroomer> twitch cares if you have nipples
[2023-01-06 06:11:05] <%$nemafow> How is she nude if shes not got bits or human
[2023-01-06 06:11:19] <!%CoopKaiju> Donald duck is walking around no pants, I think this is good
[2023-01-06 06:11:24] <%JBookwyrm> As long as no nipple it should be ok i think
[2023-01-06 06:11:29] <%Smores_mores> No bits to have
[2023-01-06 06:11:30] <!%BasilWoof> for example, Dya worked on Nyan's model for 2 months straight and it was only when Nyan streamed with it that it got her in trouble
