[2022-12-17 00:20:35] <Atreidie> If they have other roles they will do the change equip, then do a single job, go back change equip rinse repeat. The fix is to just force them to ONLY be military
[2022-12-17 00:20:36] <AlmondRoll> there's another bug where squads don't acknowledge armor that was created after it was formed
[2022-12-17 00:20:50] <%Spinel97> limesShy limesShy
[2022-12-17 00:20:57] <AlmondRoll> so you have to disband and remake the squad

[2022-12-17 00:21:01] <ionlich> You have to reassign the uniform for squads for them to notice the new armor.
[2022-12-17 00:21:04] <AlmondRoll> it's incredibly annoying

[2022-12-17 00:23:15] <SaverinM> Sometimes they don't like wearing armor over clothes. You can set it to replace their clothes instead
[2022-12-17 00:23:17] <EternalFireseal> Is it a burrow thing?
[2022-12-17 00:23:18] <ionlich> Do they have armor of appropriate size? I saw see some humans there.
[2022-12-17 00:23:20] <1waferthin> Maybe they prefer boob armor?
[2022-12-17 00:23:30] <%BestyVT> @EternalFireseal I don't think she has any burrows set up

[2022-12-17 00:24:33] <%Heimrdoodle_The_Squirrel> I think it can be in a stock pile but also claimed ie by an off-duty dwarf in another squad.
[2022-12-17 00:24:54] <samiam1616> the Dwarf Fortress subreddit has really taken off as of late, lots of incredible stories
[2022-12-17 00:25:07] <Atreidie> Could try putting all weapon/armor stockpile in the barraks

[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <AlmondRoll> @Atreidie you'd think it'd be fixed by now!!!
[2022-12-17 00:26:14] <derap41> The only one to survive the zombie attack was  a dwarf baby
[2022-12-17 00:26:17] <Atreidie> Google answer I keep seeing "The best way to solve this (though also the most tedious) is to manually assign individual pieces of armor to dwarves. No "individual choice" at all; just explicitly "*steel breastplate*" and whatnot."

[2022-12-17 01:21:46] <Atreidie> monkaS is that door wood
[2022-12-17 01:21:47] <AlmondRoll> cover it with floor
[2022-12-17 01:21:47] <%TsunamiAromatic> You can't anymore

[2022-12-17 01:21:52] <emmy_115> Happy holidays Laimu all the way from idaho to you
[2022-12-17 01:21:58] <AlmondRoll> or cover it with a hatch and lock it
[2022-12-17 01:22:13] <d0monor> Hatches work as they cant be destroyed from below, as long as its locked.
[2022-12-17 01:22:17] <+Todini11> put a hatch on it, functions like a door (but it might be a door breaker)
[2022-12-17 01:22:23] <%Spinel97> Cock sticks? limesShy
[2022-12-17 01:22:28] <%TsunamiAromatic> You'll wanna cover that hole up though

[2022-12-17 01:23:22] <littlegam> check the surface
[2022-12-17 01:23:29] <Manhuntre> they call it a forgotten beast bc the game forgot it existed
[2022-12-17 01:23:39] <+Vvaldir316> its gunna break the floor beneath you so everything caves in monkaS
[2022-12-17 01:23:42] <+Todini11> hmm, it might destroy trees/shrooms. Do those count as "cave ins" ?

[2022-12-17 01:24:02] <%EnigmaticRepose> @Todini11 If it destroys enough support, yes.

[2022-12-17 01:24:19] <%AK_Zephyr> they are drawing straws to see who does it
[2022-12-17 01:24:20] <%EnigmaticRepose> Considering it also caused a massive flood, I can only assume he's destroying SO much support
[2022-12-17 01:24:39] <d0monor> Make sure no one is walled outside your fort. A dwarven pastime to die is walling yourself outside the fort with no way back inside.

[2022-12-17 01:25:25] <$Oomlie_Wrap> definitely not acting like they're being chased by a fire monster
[2022-12-17 01:25:29] <AlmondRoll> are the miners busy with other tasks? should probably unassign them from anything that isn't mining

[2022-12-17 01:28:36] <AlmondRoll> yeah, the Gigantic Mining Designation might be keeping them busy
[2022-12-17 01:28:41] <%AK_Zephyr> priority mining is worth using

[2022-12-17 01:28:46] <$meiramystery> @EnigmaticRepose except sea sponges
[2022-12-17 01:28:50] <%SlimyGooblin> you can set priorities for mining if you go to the advanced options

[2022-12-17 01:28:54] <%TsunamiAromatic> @BigYanno It is, and sometimes laughably easy if they are made out of like ash or vomit
[2022-12-17 01:28:55] <AlmondRoll> near impossible with how deep you can go
[2022-12-17 01:28:55] <%Cpt_Chug> @BigYanno its possible but this particular one is really difficult to

[2022-12-17 01:28:56] <Leud_De_Grace> yeah, but that takes a long time for it to happen

[2022-12-17 01:29:35] <%SlimyGooblin> of course, why do you think elves exist?
[2022-12-17 01:29:38] <+Jovial7> Remember: pillage before you burn.
[2022-12-17 01:29:39] <tcman2000> Like dwarfs in every other fantasy franchise, you dig too deeply first
[2022-12-17 01:29:41] <%Cpt_Chug> NODDERS
[2022-12-17 01:29:45] <stochastic_guy> yeh, and similarly you can return to your own former forts if you make a new one in the same world
[2022-12-17 01:29:47] <$meiramystery> you can, should, must and will pillage the elves
[2022-12-17 01:29:47] <%zman12380> You are NOT gonna run out of 190 layers of ore LUL
[2022-12-17 01:29:50] <AlmondRoll> raiding is just importing but spicy
[2022-12-17 01:29:52] <Atreidie> They become trade centers, and affect the words further lore.

[2022-12-17 02:03:19] <@%Greygull> If they're too severely injured, an orderly will take it to them while they're in a hospital

[2022-12-17 02:03:27] <%TsunamiAromatic> You don't need a well
[2022-12-17 02:03:30] <%Karneolius> or a water gathering area
[2022-12-17 02:03:34] <smaug133> @EasySqueezy01 was it a troll or some other thing?
[2022-12-17 02:03:34] <Leud_De_Grace> also needs clean water or else they will have a higher chance of getting infected
[2022-12-17 02:03:35] <%AK_Zephyr> well is easier, they'll go outside to get it though

[2022-12-17 02:03:58] <@%Greygull> Build a hole above a water source and you can place a well on top of it--needs a rope/chain, a block, and a bucket.

[2022-12-17 02:11:26] <%TsunamiAromatic> That aquifer is pretty handy for getting water Kappa
[2022-12-17 02:11:30] <%AK_Zephyr> if they can get to the caverns they'll get water there
[2022-12-17 02:11:37] <ululator> you need a water source, they don't drink booze in hospitals I think

[2022-12-17 22:07:43] <%GiantEnemyGrunt> some missions are worth doing, like the materia ones, because they'll unlock summons for the roulette.
