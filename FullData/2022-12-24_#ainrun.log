[2022-12-24 09:49:13] <%AzaZ_ow> battle axe seems to be the play if you can just buy it from roundtable
[2022-12-24 09:49:14] <%Android_Saya> or war pick is already 2.5? dagger is 2.0 it might not changed your weight tier for Blue Dancer
[2022-12-24 09:49:15] <angry_mobman> blue dancer carrying?
[2022-12-24 09:49:23] <FelidaeSocialis> Try whip and caestus, they are best in 2.0 and 1.5 weight categories respectively

[2022-12-24 11:14:10] <%BigPissser> okay strategy: you did about 4% of their total health just fighting the noble while the apostle was asleep. Can you hold 25 sleep pots? cause that basically secures a victory if you keep sleeping the apostle

[2022-12-24 12:13:25] <sylmir_> Parrying Noble is quite easy. Parrying Apostle is more difficult as there are attacks that come out so fast you basically need to parry on the first frames
[2022-12-24 12:13:26] <ddiffen> 17 more dmg KEKW

[2022-12-24 13:16:36] <eladidu3> @ArhamSAA it's implied to convert "extra 20%" to 120%, which you then multiply (1.2), it's really not that farfetched
[2022-12-24 13:16:38] <Harmonixer123> pepeLaughing
[2022-12-24 13:16:39] <SpicyWe1ner> That 80% is huge in that math
[2022-12-24 13:16:41] <%SpecCop> It is additive increases, you just change the base each time

[2022-12-24 13:25:44] <SpicyWe1ner> So all that for the kick to do 96 instead of 50?
[2022-12-24 13:25:44] <%AzaZ_ow> do we consider this leg day?

[2022-12-24 13:25:48] <%sad_goblin_96> why is he so serious
[2022-12-24 13:25:50] <Harmonixer123> PepeLaugh that's not even all the stuff tbh, the boosts from reinforcement levels are also multipliers applied to the base values of weapons, same with scaling values, then you have more multipliers for each attack, 2h uses different multipliers, etc...
[2022-12-24 13:25:51] <pirl_from_sunwell> xD
[2022-12-24 13:26:02] <%+AzizYaLeL> Call him, he might make your kicks do 1K damage
[2022-12-24 13:26:20] <zrattyL> ok can u tell me what the damage from the kick is?

[2022-12-24 13:27:51] <%IGotSacked> this is useful because it can shorten the fight by 50-100 kicks

[2022-12-24 13:28:14] <%domelord420> the only bullying happening here is this dude doing 25x damage to bosses
[2022-12-24 13:28:18] <Harmonixer123> it's not just Elden Ring either, a lot of games have tons of maths that no one even considers that exists in the game LUL
[2022-12-24 13:28:20] <$MoonveiI> just get a strong ass kick to start the fight
[2022-12-24 13:28:31] <%sad_goblin_96> is  not lasting long enough a problem for you often?
[2022-12-24 13:28:39] <%IGotSacked> why would it be any harder after this combo
[2022-12-24 13:28:40] <%AzaZ_ow> it's good information to know NODDERS

[2022-12-24 13:29:15] <%IGotSacked> he can also use this to burst them down after 30-40% hp
[2022-12-24 13:29:19] <%AzaZ_ow> it would have probably been better LULW
[2022-12-24 13:29:19] <chefboyerdeee> If you can sleep the bosses next to eachother occasionally and kick them at the same time after buffing, it's gotta be pretty good damage
[2022-12-24 13:29:23] <%LtMurloc> KEKW
[2022-12-24 13:29:24] <%hiwago> @igotsacked because you need to rebuff many many times mid fight?
[2022-12-24 13:29:25] <%IGotSacked> and almost skip phase 2
[2022-12-24 13:29:35] <%AzaZ_ow> but that's why buffs are crazy in this game
[2022-12-24 13:29:38] <%IGotSacked> he only needs to use it once
[2022-12-24 13:29:45] <%IGotSacked> once per kill
[2022-12-24 13:29:52] <%$yharnam_babyface> is this him: https://www.twitch.tv/titusactual/about
[2022-12-24 13:29:57] <%+AzizYaLeL> If it's not the base damage, should you equip the talismans in order Hmmge
[2022-12-24 13:29:57] <%AzaZ_ow> I believe you get like 2-3 multiplicative damage sources in DS3
[2022-12-24 13:30:01] <%IGotSacked> he sleeps them both for every time
[2022-12-24 13:30:03] <+fluffyjesus666> that math speaks for itself

[2022-12-24 13:42:15] <%TheCorgiClan> Ye but look at it this way. If it works the fight will be way shorter
[2022-12-24 13:42:16] <%IGotSacked> you lose the 2 80% buffs and the 2 charge attack buffs
[2022-12-24 13:42:22] <BadWithNames> wouldn't it just be easier to recode the game at this point
[2022-12-24 13:42:23] <%IGotSacked> you can get at least 3-4 kicks

[2022-12-24 13:43:35] <zrattyL> i think its worth it
[2022-12-24 13:43:43] <%+AzizYaLeL> Level arcane for sleep EZ
[2022-12-24 13:43:57] <illumignostic> if you can kill one after 3 sleeps, a new one will respawn
[2022-12-24 13:44:00] <zrattyL> so u get about 584% damage
[2022-12-24 13:44:06] <%oldmonk_97> have u tried telling ur mom to call their mom to play fair? Hmm
[2022-12-24 13:44:08] <illumignostic> then you can sleep again
[2022-12-24 13:44:23] <bowletaria> try it or titus will be disappointed in u
[2022-12-24 13:44:24] <Rubickasd_xD> just sleep them GIGACHAD

[2022-12-24 13:51:44] <%oldmonk_97> @Ainrun realistically any more buffs than 2~3 buffs would start eating into the kick time Hmmge like.. you would be spending more time buffing than kicking.. and the time spend buffing would eat the time of the earlier buffs cast... idk how to phrase it better FeelsDankMan but u probably know this already FeelsDankMan

[2022-12-24 14:16:17] <@%ArhamSAA> discard all the unnecessary talismans too
[2022-12-24 14:16:18] <!%Amerrr> Doesn't having all 99 stats give you high status resistance? Or is that all armor?
[2022-12-24 14:16:30] <zrattyL> cuz u can go to the thing while the seppuku  animation is going
[2022-12-24 14:16:37] <%hiwago> definitely one of the stats does increase resist
[2022-12-24 14:16:46] <%hiwago> since all the resistances is affected by one of the other stat
[2022-12-24 14:16:48] <%IGotSacked> some stats give you status resists i think
[2022-12-24 14:16:53] <%hiwago> one or the other *

[2022-12-24 14:32:30] <+alexcon18> it seems like couple of things in the game, that kick doesnt benefit from certain buffs
[2022-12-24 14:32:31] <+paipai314> make sure you upgrade your feet
[2022-12-24 14:32:33] <$luciferslicht> tbf it did take you like 10 minutes to get to 90% before
[2022-12-24 14:32:41] <%+kamalesh_16> this conclude tht kick sucks
[2022-12-24 14:32:41] <@%ArhamSAA> I think the greaves buff is a flat damage so it doesn't get the buff
[2022-12-24 14:32:43] <zrattyL> try the normal kick
[2022-12-24 14:32:49] <!%Amerrr> what was the normal damage? 80ish?
[2022-12-24 14:32:52] <LCorazza> well, you missing a few buffs + RKR+Charged Damage
