[2022-12-27 23:51:43] <swordfush> @seraphmichael1 Considering how fast technology progressed in Korra, the new series will probably be in the space age.
[2022-12-27 23:51:59] <%Conankun66> she certainly makes my alarm go off
[2022-12-27 23:52:03] <%+seraphmichael1> @seraphmichael1 atomic age avatar would be interesting ngl
