[2022-12-24 20:30:38] <Bone_Spurs> im still working ffs

[2022-12-24 20:31:06] <%+leroy_jenkins28> They don’t celebrate Christmas same as us

[2022-12-24 21:04:07] <5cavlive5matt3r> Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it important to act "slowly" during wartime? Life isn't a video game where you have infinite lives
[2022-12-24 21:04:09] <Kaiall_> Has tarkov wiped anyone?
[2022-12-24 21:04:09] <+prohuntyt> strimer why dont you use the exact same microwave settings as me? do you enjoy cold and dry food?
[2022-12-24 21:04:10] <rochadota> its sad
[2022-12-24 21:04:14] <+Ag1tated> people hate when you have self satisfaction without needing outside confirmation

[2022-12-24 21:04:34] <+kingrelapz> tarkov especially can be played almost however one wants anyway.
[2022-12-24 21:04:35] <mastermindxlk> My raids last almost the whole time for PMC. Love the idea of spending 35+ min in a raid and chatyting and interacting with the late player scavs. Gives all the tarky vibes

[2022-12-24 21:13:48] <yno7_> is audio delayed for anyone else or just me?

[2022-12-24 21:14:29] <%+mavvkek> If audio is delayed clicking pause and unpause typically fixes it for me
[2022-12-24 21:14:32] <%ColeChiIls> @OctaeveusWinters Same! and fallout. Favorite atmo and lore of any game

[2022-12-24 21:15:54] <OctaeveusWinters> @ColeChiIls I wholeheartedly agree! People say games is a way to escape from the real world and they are right, but that game actually makes you exit this world and get lost in it like the real one doesn't exist.

[2022-12-24 21:16:11] <Saro4president> @lookingforslatt 8k but its because its inside, the problem with tarkov bitrate is because when streamers are on green outside make the stream blurry

[2022-12-24 21:17:51] <%Ljosapaldr> It's easier not to be angry and dissappointed about a game not reaching your desired level when you have many games to jump between

[2022-12-24 21:18:37] <Lourio> the lyrics are apparently controversial, after 20+ years -> cancel culture in full effect
[2022-12-24 21:18:46] <+JoeyTwopair> are you a fan of the Armored Core series?
[2022-12-24 21:18:46] <Saro4president> @jAmzye i mean if you want an example, cod gameplay its the same since mw2

[2022-12-24 21:29:59] <%Ljosapaldr> the gun customization in this game is the only reason I play it, lol. I suck at fps, but it's so fucking detailed. Makes sense for a DF nerd, I guess, that it would be the draw.
[2022-12-24 21:30:00] <ConfinedComedy> I'm of the mind that the recoil system should be removed and replaced with controlling your recoil with your mouse

[2022-12-24 21:48:30] <T_Thatcher> Natural pvp da best in my personal opinion :)
[2022-12-24 21:48:34] <masonloll> just because you sprint everywhere doesnt mean youre good
[2022-12-24 21:48:37] <jAmzye> there's just gonna be more W key players and chads, good luck to the people playing slow LUL

[2022-12-24 21:48:42] <tt1m> the title got me
[2022-12-24 21:48:50] <%+KARMERICAN> then theres those that play single player mod
[2022-12-24 21:48:51] <Suspicious_Potatoes> it'd be nice to have both, but not in every raid. Much agreed
[2022-12-24 21:48:53] <%+TheYellaKing> my theory is the pvp folks will start missing the original core tarkov. Which is all good. it will be a great mode to have
[2022-12-24 21:48:54] <oni_pepega> I like being a rat :)
[2022-12-24 21:48:55] <Summerteeth> NODDERS

[2022-12-24 21:49:03] <%darcss> I am worried ppl will only wanna watch their streamer play arena and nothing else if u play rpg tarkov they will start bitching about it @Klean

[2022-12-24 21:49:39] <jAmzye> @Penaleve thats not true, but sure buddy
[2022-12-24 21:49:40] <Keulenkonrad___> @The_kRazed yeah but later. at middle of wipe

[2022-12-24 21:53:24] <masonloll> IMO traders should have more, but you should have to barter for good shit, and maybe even remove the flea
[2022-12-24 21:53:24] <+BrewtusMaloney> @EsiMiDobar18 new cod attachment system is by far the dumbest they have come up with

[2022-12-24 21:54:02] <oni_pepega> crafting is what I enjoy in the games I play the most, it is not that perfect in Tarkov but still like it in a way

[2022-12-24 22:34:29] <+TheSoupNaz> people love to shit on star citizen cause everyone else does
[2022-12-24 22:34:29] <oddwaan> Dayz SA took a long time too
[2022-12-24 22:34:32] <%+KARMERICAN> BSG invented a new game loop. more than anyone can say about western studio trash
[2022-12-24 22:34:37] <Babyeekz> never played a game that had this much dsync with only 12 players on the map
[2022-12-24 22:34:38] <+TheSoupNaz> the tech already in place for SC is fucking insane
[2022-12-24 22:34:41] <PutinIsSmallAndBald> @Retnik If by that time we wont fuck ourselves
[2022-12-24 22:34:48] <siddo__> @the_Saltyn also yeah tarkov is still called being in beta but its more finished than a lot of games that left beta anyways
[2022-12-24 22:34:59] <%+mahhndo> Tf was that a vase on that barel?
[2022-12-24 22:35:00] <chilly_s4m> nice spawn :)
[2022-12-24 22:35:05] <shieldclock> ratJAM
[2022-12-24 22:35:05] <%ColeChiIls> @mavvkek no, Dayz was in beta for 8 years to be finished incomplete and the last year theyve added more to it then in those entire 8 years. Dayz is only still played because of mods and community servers
[2022-12-24 22:35:11] <%the_Saltyn> @the_Saltyn Exactly. Could be 2042 KEKW

[2022-12-24 22:35:22] <Babyeekz> @the_Saltyn beta just means an excuse for the devs to have when their game takes 6+ years to make
[2022-12-24 22:35:26] <siddo__> @Prisjakt not yet
[2022-12-24 22:35:29] <Babyeekz> this game is broken

[2022-12-24 23:19:01] <kaosokris> Just started EFT with the last wipe, but got so many CIs and died to that, besides to all the chads, that I never got into it...think I stopped at lvl24 and never came back. I just played on servers in my country, but still every 2nd game CI issues and never found out what to do about it. No way I play via VPN. Was there another option to get only "good servers"?!?

[2022-12-24 23:30:58] <%+StealthyHazboola> maybe because the word rat in other shows is being thrown around, lot of labels in gaming
[2022-12-24 23:30:59] <downlikeaklown> People don't realize that there's multiple ways to play this game. That's why this game is unique.

[2022-12-24 23:31:19] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> you want the game to be slow and tacictal so the fast paced people will not feel teh same

[2022-12-24 23:31:29] <truemikeyd> do u watch others enough to say they dont get treated like that
[2022-12-24 23:31:32] <SoroTheWeeb> Any new animes as of late Klean?

[2022-12-24 23:31:36] <%+TheAlbinoShow> Do you also think you notice back seaters more when its your own channel or? I feel like everybody yells at their sports teams too but streaming has a more personal relationship with the entertainer

[2022-12-24 23:32:52] <kaosokris> that'S just the backseating-syndrome combined with saying the world how good they re...plus the self-centred POV...  when I play Hunt: Showdown, there are always ppl bitching about longrange loadouts, when they run CQB and the other way around... fuck that, as long as you have fun it's good, if you also play as good as you do, even better...just enjoy yourself and don'T feed the trolls

[2022-12-24 23:44:30] <%+KARMERICAN> @Klean  mid range scopes are unusable in BB when firing full auto, if they tune that i'd agree with you
[2022-12-24 23:44:31] <siddo__> @HonestRazorback well TBF tarkovs systems and animations are also far more complex. the small things in tarkov definitely take more time to implement than in battlebit

[2022-12-24 23:45:28] <%ColeChiIls> @Ring yeah anytime im puttin in work flanking in that game you shoot me in the back KEKLEO
[2022-12-24 23:45:32] <@%SpottedTango> @Ring 's my bell
[2022-12-24 23:45:38] <+eljebus0> It has destruction, it has squad play, it has good vehicle play, it has a long weapon grind, the shooting is amazing, view distance is incredible...
[2022-12-24 23:45:38] <%ColeChiIls> portal D: eww
[2022-12-24 23:45:40] <siddo__> the sound when you get a kill is so satisfying too
[2022-12-24 23:45:40] <%+mavvkek> Barely LUL

[2022-12-24 23:45:45] <+jasp3rs> It was great when I played one of the playtests but I'll definitely get bored of it fast. I just lose attention to arena/big team battle style games.

[2022-12-24 23:46:26] <@%Ring> Its ttk until a support player with fkn fort armour rocks up to the crib
[2022-12-24 23:46:26] <%ColeChiIls> i like the ttk on BB, esp with some classes being lighter armored
[2022-12-24 23:46:32] <+devcloudxd> give me some things you dont like about battlebit
[2022-12-24 23:46:35] <@%Ring> low ttk*
[2022-12-24 23:46:35] <%+MTReese_> @colechiils kleanDad
[2022-12-24 23:46:38] <%+DomEdition> oh battlebit, word
[2022-12-24 23:46:39] <siddo__> my biggets complaint with the game is that scope glint goes through foliage and that scope glint should be in a cone from the scope IMO instead of full range
[2022-12-24 23:46:40] <+eljebus0> I think the only thing I would want in BattleBit is the Hell Let Loose style of squad make-up.
[2022-12-24 23:46:43] <%ColeChiIls> Scar H says haha to Support
[2022-12-24 23:46:48] <+blackkillder> @HonestRazorback how a game with a dozen of animation lot of customization lot of feature for healt and gun with more than 50 weapon have lazy dev ?
[2022-12-24 23:46:53] <%Tylerjku> cant stand hit markers on snipers though
[2022-12-24 23:46:56] <AyeWho> tactical team killing
[2022-12-24 23:47:07] <Babyeekz> That would be a fun option, make it more like squad, more tactical.
[2022-12-24 23:47:11] <glajman8512> Maybe low FF?
[2022-12-24 23:47:16] <Peakasso> kind of looks like fps version of Minecraft on steroids
[2022-12-24 23:47:16] <mixtellow> And that forge mode will allow that
[2022-12-24 23:47:16] <glajman8512> *friendly fire
[2022-12-24 23:47:21] <%+mavvkek> FF was aids in 2042 without the markers
[2022-12-24 23:47:22] <%RedboneGaming> sounding like Battlebit X Squad
[2022-12-24 23:47:23] <llVOYAGER> will there be aircraft?
[2022-12-24 23:47:25] <+damitsbare> Can you make custom maps in battlebit
[2022-12-24 23:47:28] <siddo__> @Tylerjku ehh, making snipers one shot bodyshot would be unbelievably broken
[2022-12-24 23:47:34] <glajman8512> word
[2022-12-24 23:47:46] <siddo__> @llVOYAGER they are working on helicopters i think
[2022-12-24 23:47:48] <@%SpottedTango> I disagree with that last one. Teammates blocking your shots is putting me back in the counter-strike GO ptsd
[2022-12-24 23:47:58] <+skehll> less grenades?
[2022-12-24 23:48:00] <llVOYAGER> nice okay
[2022-12-24 23:48:00] <+thathighbigguy> 1 bullet headshot would be my cup of fuckin tea
[2022-12-24 23:48:03] <%Tylerjku> @Tylerjku maybe only for bolts? yeah I would see that. I usually play hardcore anyway
[2022-12-24 23:48:03] <+devcloudxd> there is team damage in csgo?
[2022-12-24 23:48:17] <Babyeekz> That's the problem lol I talk about BB and I want to play so bad,
[2022-12-24 23:48:17] <+soulkeeper012> did the wipe happen?
[2022-12-24 23:48:22] <@%Ring> I really wanna play it, I can't believe that playercount change was so potent, I was kinda mid on it until I played 128 players
[2022-12-24 23:48:25] <%+DomEdition> just waiting for that release date basically
[2022-12-24 23:48:26] <@%SpottedTango> @devcloudxd ff is ranked only. casual is klean's description

[2022-12-24 23:48:33] <%+KARMERICAN> make mid range optics not rattle like a brick in a dryer when you shoot them @Klean
[2022-12-24 23:48:34] <ChuckYoga> kleanKool sup
[2022-12-24 23:48:46] <siddo__> @Tylerjku even for bolts that would be too OP IMO, the zeroing already makes sniping relatively easy in my opinion. atleast now you have to hit a headshot
[2022-12-24 23:48:47] <+devcloudxd> @SpottedTango casual gross xd
[2022-12-24 23:48:53] <+sirsylvesterr> the gun progress system is perfect too, its not these OD task
[2022-12-24 23:48:56] <@%SpottedTango> no one plays ranked
[2022-12-24 23:49:05] <+sirsylvesterr> its just simple, get kills
[2022-12-24 23:49:13] <@%SpottedTango> can't kick a cheater
[2022-12-24 23:49:14] <Alziiii> Is the wipe live?
[2022-12-24 23:49:16] <gregoryiscute> unpopular opinion here : mid-late wipe is my fav part of time to play because I like the realism of playing full kit ppl . in real life I will be geared and so will the enemy (probably)
[2022-12-24 23:49:23] <@%Ring> God I'd play all day
[2022-12-24 23:49:23] <+eljebus0> Ok, so BattleBit on the 27th at 9pm Eastern, the 28th at 2:30pm Eastern, 30th at 8:30am Eastern

[2022-12-24 23:49:57] <siddo__> i had the sickest killstreak last playtest, was sitting on a building as sniper with acog, enemy had no clue where i was just popping head after head. the game is so unbelievably good
[2022-12-24 23:50:00] <+PunchFruit> wipe but no loot raids? what's the reason for that?
[2022-12-24 23:50:02] <%RedboneGaming> @Klean someone just asked Lvndmark about wipe at the same time as they asked you and you both said almost the same thing KEKW

[2022-12-24 23:50:21] <salgolkin> @Klean you gonna try diablo 4 when it comes out? or you not really an ARPG kinda guy?

[2022-12-24 23:51:06] <NoShotAstronaut> @Klean any dark and darker today?
[2022-12-24 23:51:08] <siddo__> @Tylerjku i had some struggles at first but after playing a bit (using the m200 helps a lot too, that thing has insane muzzle velocity) i can hit heads pretty consistently
[2022-12-24 23:51:13] <%RedboneGaming> it says something to me about the tarkov community KEKW

[2022-12-24 23:51:46] <%Tylerjku> @Tylerjku maybe thats the case only have a few hours into the game
[2022-12-24 23:51:47] <%+KARMERICAN> only complaint with d3 was artstyle
[2022-12-24 23:51:50] <+CastleVolf> alright, Im going to try Bannerlord, Any tips to make it fun?
[2022-12-24 23:51:54] <African_Abroadd> ive seen the way with DND and how insane fighter can be for a solo player, having a bow + sword and shield is a game changer
[2022-12-24 23:51:58] <Suspicious_Potatoes> I low key hate how people call it DnD instead of maybe DaD. DnD is already a game
[2022-12-24 23:51:59] <%+DomEdition> id hope D4 revitalizes the franchise, soon to be seen
[2022-12-24 23:51:59] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean but it's turn-based
[2022-12-24 23:52:03] <siddo__> also @Klean question about IRL vs ingame in battlebit, in battlebit suppressors reduce accuracy and muzzle velocity, dont they do the opposite IRL?
[2022-12-24 23:52:10] <ShadyBoBandy> @klean do they sell that labs lamp anywhere? Or is that for like partnered Tarkov streamers?

[2022-12-24 23:52:56] <siddo__> @Tylerjku IMO use the first DMR you get until you unlock the m200, its the only bolt worth using as the muzzle velocity is pretty low on the others
[2022-12-24 23:52:58] <@%SpottedTango> Pog
[2022-12-24 23:52:59] <%+MTReese_> Oh heck yeah that’s cool
