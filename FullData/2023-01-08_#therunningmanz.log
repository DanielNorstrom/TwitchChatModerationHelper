[2023-01-08 14:14:43] <%Brother_Garrett> @TheRunningManZ I have to say this  4090 eats DayZ for breakfast LUL no regrets here man
[2023-01-08 14:14:45] <!%QuantumAI> vsync is the opposite @commanda__, it limits the games framerate when its fluctuating
[2023-01-08 14:14:45] <Kobasiburek> @TheRunningManZ @Brother_Garrett If it's 165, doesn't it come with the ability to go lower? Like 144, 120,75,60... Also, locking the FPS at something like 120 would stress the GPU out less = more lifetime, it would produce less heat, use less power plus I've heard a lot of people who went over 120 say they can't tell the difference
[2023-01-08 14:14:53] <+J1inja> @TheTorlay love mine

[2023-01-08 14:16:04] <%Brother_Garrett> @Kobasiburek you could also put the  4090 on 80% powerlimit so it uses 20% less power but 2-3% less performance
[2023-01-08 14:16:04] <The_2_Faces> I had the same issue on my screen. I bougt 2 1/2 years ago an LG screen and it went "kaputt" with black lines (it was by the a widescreen, would never change back to something different) After the issue with the monitor I had sadly to go back to LG, due to the issues VA panels and 144hz freesync issues.

[2023-01-08 14:42:13] <%the_dailynomad> man i dont understand i hear dayz two many times, but what would be dayz 2??
[2023-01-08 14:42:15] <%turoksierra115> It's crazy DayZ is ten years old and still kicking
[2023-01-08 14:42:20] <$luktac> yes. cheap
[2023-01-08 14:42:27] <%payton111b> can't wait I'll be there
[2023-01-08 14:42:28] <uncle__rucku5> what the longest you had a character survive
[2023-01-08 14:42:29] <erik_does_gaming> In my opinion I think the primary issue in DayZ is the KOS mentality. Sure it‚Äôs necessary some times but usually I find that it‚Äôs not justified based on the circumstances.
[2023-01-08 14:42:33] <midlander1> The Bunker on  Livonia really helped the map get played on console
[2023-01-08 14:42:39] <%+crslk> @akinator1410 gotta use keyboard and mouse on console for it to be playable

[2023-01-08 14:43:07] <Buueatuup> respectfully, is a dayz 2 ever comes please realise that it needs a new engine, this one is literally hanging together with bandaids. they could not even upgrade this dayz to full-enfusion, dayz is the best game, agree on that. but under the hood its a mess. (there is goldsource engine stuff left lols)

[2023-01-08 14:43:33] <watasiur> and what if we get a Dayz mod in Arma 4 ? that would worth checking out?
[2023-01-08 14:43:34] <%Viking_Saint> The Arma 4 test didn't look much different than DayZ now. I think a DayZ 2 would just split the player base

[2023-01-08 14:44:32] <Buueatuup> current dayz is a mess of 3 game engines hanging together with patches, still the best game do not get me wrong. but lets not state it doesnt need a new engine for a second version. this version is ok but dayz 2 can be ran on a mix of 3 engines lol
[2023-01-08 14:44:37] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> If they do like 6 updates a year ‚Ä¶ do we need dayz2?

[2023-01-08 14:45:45] <+KjacMyers> i mean, i feel like they would just update this game over to full enfusion at some point rather than try to force everyone onto a dayz 2. splitting the playerbase like that seems like a big risk

[2023-01-08 14:50:44] <Kobasiburek> The only kind of upgrade DayZ needs IMO (fixing the few big bugs is a must too) would be updates to the interiors of most buildings, updates to the zombie and animal behavior and pathing (could be considered bugs) and an update to the lighting, so they wouldn't have to make the artificial darkness like we see in the underground areas of Namalsk. The last one could be added with the newer versions of the Enfusion engine for ARMA and if so, hopefully it can be integrated into DayZ.
[2023-01-08 14:50:52] <erik_does_gaming> If they make another DayZ 2 it better have some type of reverse compatibility
