[2023-01-03 01:34:59] <%escrimah> gally snuffPunch
[2023-01-03 01:35:16] <!%Nastychain> i can touch grass in a virtual world NODDERS
[2023-01-03 01:35:21] <%Nuggit_36> COPIUM
[2023-01-03 01:35:24] <%gallyfz> nasty you could get into making/building things
[2023-01-03 01:35:53] <!%Nastychain> i have absolutely 0 creativity
[2023-01-03 01:35:57] <%gallyfz> you could make a custom snuffy sphincter
[2023-01-03 01:35:57] <!%Nastychain> im the most uncreative person in the world
[2023-01-03 01:36:07] <!%Nastychain> that would be a good idea
[2023-01-03 01:36:15] <%Nuggit_36> HUH
[2023-01-03 01:36:42] <%gallyfz> I can help you with it, would just need basic tools and some paint
[2023-01-03 01:37:43] <%escrimah> do you live somewhere where there's a lot of snow nasty? I've always wanted to learn how to snowboard or ski
[2023-01-03 01:38:42] <!%Nastychain> nah i get snow like once every 4 or 5 years
[2023-01-03 01:38:56] <!%Nastychain> although i have tried skiing
[2023-01-03 01:39:00] <!%Nastychain> i quit after 20 minutes
[2023-01-03 01:39:13] <%gallyfz> have you ever tried mountain biking? or any action sports like that
[2023-01-03 01:39:34] <%Nuggit_36> mountain biking is a great one
[2023-01-03 01:39:49] <!%Nastychain> snuffHmm no i havent
[2023-01-03 01:40:50] <%Nuggit_36> snuffHmm although i found its a lot more fun with a good bike, which can be expensive...
[2023-01-03 01:40:57] <%gallyfz> it's pretty fun. I'm getting back into it after the winter. plus you can technically do it completely alone (so long as someone knows where you're going)
[2023-01-03 01:41:11] <%gallyfz> yeah you can get away with something real basic for a long time in most cases though
[2023-01-03 01:41:39] <!%Nastychain> interesting
[2023-01-03 01:41:55] <%escrimah> if you get a bike you could put snuffy stickers on it Pog

[2023-01-03 01:54:22] <!%Nastychain> ive never thought i would enjoy hiking
[2023-01-03 01:55:41] <%Nuggit_36> i dont do it a lot, but its a nice way to just get away for a few hours Okayge
[2023-01-03 01:57:51] <!%Nastychain> i usually just go to sleep if i feel the need to get away
[2023-01-03 02:00:21] <%Nuggit_36> its way easier to think through problems when hiking though
