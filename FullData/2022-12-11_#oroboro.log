[2022-12-11 00:51:57] <Nyanbro> @whitebat_ivi you mean the main theme's leitmotif which appears during the radagon fight for example? GoW's composer relied on two motifs exactly, which is why they're so anchored in my brain. the TGA orchestra just didn't put a lot of emphasis imo
[2022-12-11 00:52:14] <pink_dumb> they technically said that they have more planned for elden ring so that could mean dlc or books and stuff

[2022-12-11 01:02:57] <!%$Mohl97> @KungFuAndrew mechwarrior 5 is pretty fun, think of it like mount and blade, where you go around the map, except where mount and blade has you just pick fights with people, you do missions at different star systems in mechwarrior. The customization took a hit between online and 5 though, and you don't get to change engine, armor type, or some of the finer details of your mechs. This is fixable with mods though

[2022-12-11 01:13:25] <alisasr> @idontsmurf69 maces are kinda good now, namely the morning star. Crouch poke and running r2 are very strong now. Fist weapons (my favorite) are actually viable now, speed and recovery buffs for every attack.

[2022-12-11 01:56:51] <SuburbanSocrates> If you have flies and you don't know where they're coming from, it's frequently because something died in your walls and flies laid eggs in it. But if you don't smell anything, that usually rules it out.
[2022-12-11 01:56:52] <SoupIsTasty5> Are they small fruit flies or house flies @Oroboro ?

[2022-12-11 01:58:18] <Austinkane> Oro gets his nutrition from suppositories

[2022-12-11 02:23:27] <@%Peeve> @AuroraR6 for Elden Ring? the game is so large that I'd say it doesn't have as much replayability as Demon's Souls. But your first playthrough could take you like 200+ hours.

[2022-12-11 02:27:40] <@%Peeve> @AuroraR6 Well, the map is so massive that the idea of re-exploring everywhere you did the first time around in the hopes of finding something new is pretty daunting, coaxing you to just sort of run through areas instead of genuinely exploring them all over again. Demon's Souls followup playthroughs can be pretty quick and satisfying to run through
[2022-12-11 02:28:23] <@%Peeve> which is why if you pick Elden Ring for your next game, you should take your time exploring everywhere you want as slow as you want

[2022-12-11 02:34:14] <+Bragdras> Latenna dies very quickly
[2022-12-11 02:34:15] <%$GloriousDutch> Use the Land Squirts
[2022-12-11 02:34:18] <+Bragdras> Like, very quickly
[2022-12-11 02:34:18] <+captain_balrick> Latenna has been pretty effective from what I've seen. So long as you can keep her alive lol
[2022-12-11 02:34:19] <@%Pallydan9K> Tricia is in the catacombs by the perfumer’s grotto
[2022-12-11 02:34:30] <YourSponsor_> getting uplifting aromatic from the perfumer is big epic but it's kinda RNG
[2022-12-11 02:34:30] <+captain_balrick> Yeah she's pretty squishy

[2022-12-11 02:34:46] <+Bragdras> She can deal some damage but getting her in a good position is pretty hard
[2022-12-11 02:34:48] <SincereVastir> Mausoleum Soldiers are pretty beefy. but down in Deeproot.
[2022-12-11 02:34:49] <!%$Mohl97> not sure if the three you can summon are big enough
[2022-12-11 02:34:50] <quickdraw202> I wonder if your teammate summons wolves and you summon latenna if she will get on one
[2022-12-11 02:34:51] <@%Peeve> if Latenna is in a fight against someone using wolf summons, will she ride one LUL

[2022-12-11 03:07:53] <powerless_imp0> if they do that it will come to playstation first for at least a year
[2022-12-11 03:07:53] <@%Pallydan9K> Because Bloodborne is owned by Sony
[2022-12-11 03:07:56] <EltonHed> @bullymaguiree_ how about u stop spamming all the time
[2022-12-11 03:07:59] <+RaziWraith> @Ebonslayer hard disagree about removing jumping but you are right that currently it is way too safe in pvp
[2022-12-11 03:08:00] <ihateoroboro> oroboro are you scared of me?
[2022-12-11 03:08:08] <suspiciouslymissingsock> When do you think Bloodborne Kart is going to come out?

[2022-12-11 03:08:14] <%Mofosweetness> that trade tho lol
[2022-12-11 03:08:15] <@%Peeve> summons at this level are fucking pointless LUL seems like it's better suited for 70-90
[2022-12-11 03:08:16] <!%AuroraUnit486> sony are never letting demon's souls and bloodborne out of their deathgrip
[2022-12-11 03:08:16] <SoupIsTasty5> Fun build
[2022-12-11 03:08:19] <@%Peeve> it's like having a snack before the fight
[2022-12-11 03:08:24] <+captain_balrick> 666 damage
[2022-12-11 03:08:25] <Mittmotto> 666 damage  EZ
[2022-12-11 03:08:25] <%awaken1992> BluePoint needs to save us by remaking Bloodborne and then generating the buzz for the sequel.
[2022-12-11 03:08:26] <+RaggleFraggl3> @oroboro have you used dung eater summon in arena yet?
[2022-12-11 03:08:27] <+boosserbud> Has he seen anyone using Tyche yet? I’m curious how well she does

[2022-12-11 03:08:34] <!%Ebonslayer> @RaziWraith Again, my issue is it closes distance easily. I'm a spear user, the way to beat me is to get in. Jumps make that a non-challenge.

[2022-12-11 03:56:35] <powerless_imp0> @Austinkane I would agree with oro
[2022-12-11 03:56:35] <!%Ebonslayer> @poggers299 My point is reaction speed can be due to factors other than skill.
[2022-12-11 03:56:36] <+lSam_l> Hhh hes stylish

[2022-12-11 03:57:00] <%KungFuAndrew> @zekrond Sure, but when the reaction time is grossly separated, it doesn't make you a good player. Imagine a pro tennis player beating someone who's played tennis for 3 days, then claiming to be awesome. the really good players test themselves against people who are similar or better than them, then overcome it

[2022-12-11 03:57:28] <poggers299> @Ebonslayer better reaction speed = more skilled
[2022-12-11 03:57:34] <%+zekrond> If you can’t react in time going against a moonveil then you’re bad. Imo

[2022-12-11 03:58:04] <powerless_imp0> that is one of the sweatiest setups, the only way I have found to deal with it is a similar set up or parrying
[2022-12-11 03:58:07] <!%Ebonslayer> @poggers299 It can be, but you can be extremely skilled but 40 years old and not be able to react to some things. Skill is one of many factors, not the only one.
[2022-12-11 03:58:07] <@%Pallydan9K> Must do jump

[2022-12-11 03:58:21] <%KungFuAndrew> @poggers299 As a martial arts instructor, I can basically tell you from experience that this is not factual. I've had students with zero skill that are fast. They don't do well against a moderately fast person that has more skill.

[2022-12-11 03:58:25] <chicasloco11433> But is fs responsible for that or bandai for the servers?

[2022-12-11 04:14:10] <will_dota> What bothers me the most about the moonveil is the stagger. They can keep the damage, just don’t make my character stand still for 2 full seconds when getting hit
[2022-12-11 04:14:16] <%+zekrond> Moonveil is def a pride weapon LUL

[2022-12-11 04:14:50] <%$Leonardo_07> @Oroboro Moonveil or Frayed Blade, what do you like more?
[2022-12-11 04:14:55] <2inverse> Good to see the connections still look terrible in the game lol. Guess they don't factor in PvP when talking about goty stuff
[2022-12-11 04:14:55] <+Marauder0670> baiting out those panic dodges is nice haha
[2022-12-11 04:14:58] <will_dota> @kungfuandrew that sounds fair

[2022-12-11 04:15:46] <OnlyTees> moonviels weaponart so good. but I still like blood katana
[2022-12-11 04:15:47] <powerless_imp0> at that point in the game's life cycle
[2022-12-11 04:15:56] <!%Ebonslayer> @powerless_imp0 You could easily bleed early on, but they nerfed it to shit.

[2022-12-11 04:16:33] <%KungFuAndrew> I do wish they would buff Rivers just a tiny bit so it's not totally useless

[2022-12-11 04:16:39] <%+zekrond> @ebonslayer yea shit used to bleed from one L2

[2022-12-11 04:17:09] <1pancakes> why is rivers useless? because it doesn't outtrade literally everything?

[2022-12-11 04:19:53] <%$Leonardo_07> No, he was cool.
[2022-12-11 04:19:54] <%+zekrond> Next balance patch is gonna be great I feel like. So much more shit is getting light shone on it
[2022-12-11 04:19:59] <PickleSteinTM> It was me oro we know this 4Head
[2022-12-11 04:20:00] <val_draconis> hopefully they just block use of waves of gold in arena
[2022-12-11 04:20:00] <%beau_xo> frost stitcher let the hate flow through you
[2022-12-11 04:20:06] <!%Ebonslayer> This is the guy you first destroyed on your return to Moonveil.
[2022-12-11 04:20:09] <TheDropOutDragon> I'm sorry man. I've honestly run into the same stuff you're running into, and I didn't realize it was actually you. I'm not here for drama, GG's and all that.
[2022-12-11 04:20:14] <o0Olli0o> "i think this guy is pretty honests" -> hits him with moonveil 5 times KEKW

[2022-12-11 04:20:24] <%KungFuAndrew> @zekrond That's a really good point. The Arena is making a very stark contrast between certain setups
[2022-12-11 04:20:26] <GillyOfficial> i figured the arena would end up kinda boring
[2022-12-11 04:20:26] <WakeX> forgot the other at work
[2022-12-11 04:20:34] <goverment_calamari> Figured it’d be best 2 of 3
[2022-12-11 04:20:40] <TheDropOutDragon> @Oroboro Being honest, I punish that out of muscle memory from invasions because of how strong it was. Jebaited
[2022-12-11 04:20:41] <%KnownAsOzone> I have been enjoying themed spirit summon 1v1s
[2022-12-11 04:20:58] <%$Leonardo_07> @TheDropOutDragon He is talking about other person now. Someone using the Stitcher who was toxic af.
[2022-12-11 04:20:58] <%+zekrond> @kungfuandrew like wave of gold was seen as fine in regular pvp I feel like. But now in arena it covers almost the entire arena
[2022-12-11 04:20:58] <yvngchvd> The arena where you fight one person and you get to respawn was pretty cool until people start evading after the get 1 kill up on you
[2022-12-11 04:20:58] <OnlyTees> ds 2 pvp arenas were fun

[2022-12-11 04:22:02] <GillyOfficial> @OnlyTees DS2 is pretty much best pvp confirmed at this point
[2022-12-11 04:22:03] <%+zekrond> @KungFuAndrew Right dude! Hopefully we see some good changes. ESP if they add 6 player invasions oh my

[2022-12-11 04:26:13] <%hokmon_> it's hard to imagine axes actually being good, but lets find out
[2022-12-11 04:26:13] <yvngchvd> Collosal great sword with fingerprint sheild
[2022-12-11 04:26:14] <doshuevos_> have you tried the twin curve sword blood build ?
[2022-12-11 04:26:17] <+J1nx_13> cleavers have that fun R2
[2022-12-11 04:26:18] <chicasloco11433> yes sir
[2022-12-11 04:26:18] <FoxKnight32> did they buff axes?
[2022-12-11 04:26:21] <!%Ebonslayer> @Oroboro I'd recommend either Hand Axe or Iron Cleaver. They're the best movesets imo.
[2022-12-11 04:26:22] <Bizhop_Ownz> Invasion compass is broken. Doesn't show position of Host.
[2022-12-11 04:26:26] <Marshmallum> you can invade chat the compass is broken
[2022-12-11 04:26:29] <$TheSortingHelmet> Dual Flails for Chat
[2022-12-11 04:26:32] <sirbarlionel> single cleavers is more than enough
[2022-12-11 04:26:34] <%$Leonardo_07> Ohhh
[2022-12-11 04:26:36] <%$Leonardo_07> I see
[2022-12-11 04:26:37] <+satori_hanzo_san> Iron Cleaver R2 + RKR + Axe Talisman hits like a truck
[2022-12-11 04:26:39] <%+rnblaze> chopa chopa
[2022-12-11 04:26:40] <moonbath> try taunters tongue. no compass means more organic surprises?
[2022-12-11 04:26:43] <%+bullymaguiree_> double claws @Oroboro
[2022-12-11 04:26:44] <%KungFuAndrew> Oh yeah, it's pushing forward a lot more on the R1s
[2022-12-11 04:26:47] <sirbarlionel> love this weapon , especially it's r2
[2022-12-11 04:26:47] <alisasr> the r1 mashing is fast on those
[2022-12-11 04:26:47] <!%$Mohl97> I wanna see if you can do anything with shabriri's woe in spirit summon fights. I know it definitely works for pulling the aggro of every summon in the area, but the hyper-specialized build I made is shit for actually fighting them
[2022-12-11 04:26:53] <%KnownAsOzone> oro, 2hand one of them and attack
[2022-12-11 04:27:01] <%hokmon_> the r1s actually seem sort of good
[2022-12-11 04:27:02] <!%Ebonslayer> chop chop chop chop chop chop
[2022-12-11 04:27:04] <+Sn0rkle> that fast

[2022-12-11 04:27:10] <%KungFuAndrew> Wow that speed is nice!
[2022-12-11 04:27:18] <%hokmon_> that plus rkr could be pretty good
[2022-12-11 04:27:19] <chicasloco11433> Ps flails got buff too I think
[2022-12-11 04:27:22] <sirbarlionel> I don't recommend having powerstance on those
[2022-12-11 04:27:23] <Bizhop_Ownz> Cragblade axe kek
[2022-12-11 04:27:26] <!%Ebonslayer> @Oroboro Hand Axe is also really fast.
[2022-12-11 04:27:29] <$TheSortingHelmet> Only dual flails @chicasloco11433
[2022-12-11 04:27:31] <+caligowen> That's kinda dope
[2022-12-11 04:27:32] <+J1nx_13> i used to use this with flaming strike then use the wierd R2 after the flaming strike
[2022-12-11 04:27:32] <%KungFuAndrew> Didn't flails get the same buff?
[2022-12-11 04:27:35] <+Sn0rkle> powerwield?
[2022-12-11 04:27:38] <+J1nx_13> would catch a lot of people
[2022-12-11 04:27:39] <boostergoldz> give me back ds3 twin axe moveset
[2022-12-11 04:27:40] <%KnownAsOzone> use this axe with gravitas and fully charge the R2 if you land it, it's a great panic roll catcher
[2022-12-11 04:27:40] <%hokmon_> only dual flails got buffed, for some reason
[2022-12-11 04:27:40] <$TheSortingHelmet> only dual @kungfuandrew

[2022-12-11 04:28:27] <%hokmon_> that's why you use rkr, pretty sure I remember rkr plus that running attack hitting like a truck
[2022-12-11 04:28:34] <%hokmon_> the charged r2
[2022-12-11 04:28:42] <Gorvin> yes

[2022-12-11 04:28:46] <+Zanman1224> rkr is scummy in duels
[2022-12-11 04:28:47] <TheRealWholehorse> Flails do hammer poise damage, it's actually pretty good also considering they can't be parried.
[2022-12-11 04:28:49] <+satori_hanzo_san> yeah rkr/axe talisman makes the R2 almost a one hit
[2022-12-11 04:28:53] <sirbarlionel> you can catch a lot of people by surprise with the running animations of the R2 attack , you could call it "scare catch" instead of "roll-catch" LUL
[2022-12-11 04:28:57] <+Yobolight> two handing can go over 99

[2022-12-11 04:36:31] <+RGB__98> There a different between being a meta gamer and a tryhard. A tryhard do their best with the tools they choose, a meta gamer chooses the only the OP stuff
[2022-12-11 04:36:32] <!%Ebonslayer> @psycbn The point of a game is to have fun.

[2022-12-11 04:50:59] <%Qwozle> did you end up doing ~ no respexs ~
[2022-12-11 04:50:59] <baconbitesu> warcry build my beloved
[2022-12-11 04:51:00] <%KungFuAndrew> @FRIED_SQUIDS Celebrants Cleaver has it, the rest do not
[2022-12-11 04:51:04] <Tetsaiga> Magnet spell so you bring them to you?
[2022-12-11 04:51:08] <@%Pallydan9K> all the roars should give a damage boost
[2022-12-11 04:51:11] <+teb0so> use the wild strikes ash of war with this weapon
[2022-12-11 04:51:16] <podlong> war cry would change the r2 though right?
[2022-12-11 04:51:32] <@%Pallydan9K> war cry and barbaric roar are faster but braggart's roar also gives you stamina regen and defense
[2022-12-11 04:51:36] <roose644> Is determination weaker than RKR?
[2022-12-11 04:51:41] <krakenoneopen> gravitas to pull into charged attack

[2022-12-11 04:52:21] <krunchysox9> @roose644 yes. Determination is a 10% boost and RKR is 15% iirc
[2022-12-11 04:52:21] <+satori_hanzo_san> Thing about this build, if you've got enough poise, you can trade hits because very seldom will you get out damaged
[2022-12-11 04:52:22] <sirbarlionel> long rage bestial roar, or whatever that's called you get as reward from Gurank
[2022-12-11 04:52:23] <%hokmon_> why would you trade with rkr
[2022-12-11 04:52:24] <boostergoldz> good trade
[2022-12-11 04:52:30] <%$Leonardo_07> But the damage is good. lol
[2022-12-11 04:52:33] <+caligowen> Funny seeing that axe do more damage than a 7 foot chunk of metal

[2022-12-11 04:52:53] <boostergoldz> frost is really good on certain weapons
[2022-12-11 04:52:59] <akatosh_1318> This weapon may help me win PVE Evo 2023
[2022-12-11 04:53:00] <TheOneNamedQ> Does Celibrant’s Cleaver have more or less range?
[2022-12-11 04:53:01] <chicasloco11433> Rks makes any weapon good, right?
[2022-12-11 04:53:17] <%KungFuAndrew> @Seylamander Probably because the frost will proc even if they roll the attack due to a glitch
[2022-12-11 04:53:19] <boostergoldz> don't think i'd do it on an ultra gs tho
[2022-12-11 04:53:19] <%$Leonardo_07> Looks like a heavy Falchion.
[2022-12-11 04:53:30] <1021022> maybe glintblade phalanx could stun them to combo into it

[2022-12-11 04:58:02] <val_draconis> @zekrond ive just been toying around with figuring out a setup to match my ds1 Artorias build i had and he unluckily got stuck with me while i was trying bleed infusion on my iron greatsword
[2022-12-11 04:58:03] <%KungFuAndrew> @chicasloco11433 Yes it is
[2022-12-11 04:58:09] <+caligowen> The r2 animation can be tricky to adjust to when trying to roll away

[2022-12-11 04:59:03] <johny7> neat, thx bud
[2022-12-11 04:59:06] <TayCoMi> maybe replace axe
[2022-12-11 04:59:08] <+satori_hanzo_san> it lets you close distance so quick with that R2

[2022-12-11 06:14:16] <bobthemutant> @Noob_Almost Yeah, I mean, I'm really interested in seeing what the game is, but a pretty announcement trailer doesn't tell if it's something I want to play

[2022-12-11 06:14:55] <%KungFuAndrew> @Noob_Almost A pretty announcement trailer from From Soft tells me I want to play it. They've been nailing it since 2009. I doubt they're going to just suddenly drop the ball.
[2022-12-11 06:15:04] <%$Noob_Almost> @Noob_Almost oh i want to play it. i just temper the hype until we get to see the real deal
[2022-12-11 06:15:25] <@%Pallydan9K> Is someone trying to say that armored core 6 isn't going to be awesome
[2022-12-11 06:15:34] <kill_bill1984> Two reduvia i guess
[2022-12-11 06:15:36] <bobthemutant> @Noob_Almost I don't doubt their competency, but I'm also not interested in Deracine just because FromSoft made it
[2022-12-11 06:15:37] <%+SayonaraSoma> people are saying you're not allowed to be excited

[2022-12-11 06:16:33] <%LuminArcTech> So brave to be using that axe. they are definitely just for fun
[2022-12-11 06:16:38] <@%Pallydan9K> like, if anything, fromsoft always makes a FUN game
[2022-12-11 06:17:00] <+Tcrror> Elden Ring is the first Souls game I have played, and I fell in love HARD
[2022-12-11 06:17:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @Pallydan9K I'm on the fence because AC is commended for its good PVP. But Fromsoft has shown they don't care about PVP anymore.

[2022-12-11 06:17:05] <@%Pallydan9K> the serpent hunter huh, right

[2022-12-11 06:17:18] <@%Pallydan9K> yeah can't give you one of those
[2022-12-11 06:17:23] <Drytin> at least it is easy to get
[2022-12-11 06:17:24] <%mururasa> Yeah the one where Rykard is
[2022-12-11 06:17:35] <Sunrun176> Correct, gotta grab it oneself
[2022-12-11 06:17:38] <boostergoldz> night rider halberd
[2022-12-11 06:17:41] <%KungFuAndrew> If it were any other developer, I would be tempering my hype. From Soft is just killing it over and over
[2022-12-11 06:17:52] <+Tcrror> I wish you could use the Ash of War from Serpent Hunter. It's so damn cool.
[2022-12-11 06:18:12] <!%Ebonslayer> I have no doubts AC6 will be good. I doubt the PVP will be good.
