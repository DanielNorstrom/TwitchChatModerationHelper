[2022-12-15 17:24:48] <veriquay> yeah it got nerfed a while ago
[2022-12-15 17:24:56] <enui___> this always seemed so weird to me that the expected drop chance had to be exactly 1.05
[2022-12-15 17:25:05] <%Shizoko> 1 gold + %5 1 gold more

[2022-12-15 17:25:16] <%Zedaine112> every 2 cast gets one gold, and on average 1 in every 40 is 2 gold
[2022-12-15 17:25:17] <BigBubbalu> With a chance to drop one more gold as well
[2022-12-15 17:25:17] <%robotSabotage> that seems not great
[2022-12-15 17:25:19] <+j0d0> and it tracks between rounds
[2022-12-15 17:25:30] <%DM_MonkeyMan> It's like 1 extra gold a turn unless you get stomped
[2022-12-15 17:25:33] <krolpejas> triple shojin sivir Pog
[2022-12-15 17:25:33] <%robotSabotage> ohhhh if it tracks between rounds thats not bad
[2022-12-15 17:25:34] <veriquay> @j0d0 oh it does?? PogO
[2022-12-15 17:25:36] <BonesGamingLive> Gotta get blue buff, and other stuff so she casts at least 4 times each match
[2022-12-15 17:25:38] <goldrogertft> I think first cast gets gold then. Every 2 after that
[2022-12-15 17:25:45] <+j0d0> so if you cast 3   times in one round, it gives you a gold on the first one
[2022-12-15 17:25:48] <Papalotapuss> sup gv8
[2022-12-15 17:26:09] <kaziriz> triple shojin sivir monkas
[2022-12-15 17:26:18] <%Zedaine112> @robotSabotage i wouldnt say it tracks between rounds, its just 5% change is 1/20, and every 2 casts so that means 1 in every 40 is 2 gold on average
[2022-12-15 17:26:22] <veriquay> i don’t think it’s always first cast i think it’s cause it tracks between rounds
[2022-12-15 17:26:33] <veriquay> oh maybe not then idk i’m trusting chat
[2022-12-15 17:27:53] <+j0d0> @robotSabotage That's the double gold math, lol.  It tracks the number of casts between rounds. So if you end a round on an "off" cast, you proc on the first cast the next round.

[2022-12-15 17:28:07] <kaziriz> it's a meh augment
[2022-12-15 17:28:33] <%Zedaine112> @robotSabotage ohhhh i see what you mean. it tracks the odd number of casts between rounds. thanks for clarifying
[2022-12-15 17:28:33] <+j0d0> @kaziriz every time I've gotten it I go fast nine and 1st/2nd with a shojin investment.
[2022-12-15 17:29:02] <+3g0_glitch> I think it counts as more gold just because it allows to hit breakpoints
[2022-12-15 17:29:03] <kaziriz> I shall try it then, cheers
[2022-12-15 17:29:13] <veriquay> it’s gold over a long time though, isn’t that much less valuable
[2022-12-15 17:29:26] <+j0d0> @veriquay it spikes you to 50 faster.
[2022-12-15 17:29:37] <%Zedaine112> gold over time helps econ in the long con

[2022-12-15 18:06:41] <Luis39091> plot is irrelevant
[2022-12-15 18:06:45] <%+sirculedhel> story is bad, graphics are epic. overall it is over hyped.
[2022-12-15 18:06:46] <veriquay> ok we’re talking about the last airbender right

[2022-12-15 18:09:35] <Rondeer> ok fair, but for sure the action will involve those whales from the trailer
[2022-12-15 18:09:39] <veriquay> the best movie ever is “The Room” (2003)

[2022-12-15 18:10:12] <+pureTFT> the best movie is The Room by Tommy Wiseau
[2022-12-15 18:10:15] <+pureTFT> simple as
[2022-12-15 18:10:16] <%Zedaine112> pretty sure it's still considered shawshank redemption
[2022-12-15 18:10:21] <veriquay> i just said that ok @puretft
[2022-12-15 18:10:22] <Rondeer> 0% on Rotten Tomatoes means 0% rotten reviews

[2022-12-15 18:11:10] <Luis39091> i think god of war ragnarok was a better game than elden ring
[2022-12-15 18:11:15] <Luis39091> for goty
[2022-12-15 18:11:17] <%Zedaine112> imdb still has shawshank redemption as the top movie of all time
[2022-12-15 18:11:17] <ValiantVincent> Tropic Thunder the best comedy ever dont @ me there isn't an argument

[2022-12-15 18:13:50] <%+sirculedhel> Interstellar was overhyped.
[2022-12-15 18:13:52] <%DM_MonkeyMan> I liked Tenet
[2022-12-15 18:13:54] <stinkydoodiediaper> I thought inception was kinda dumb
[2022-12-15 18:13:55] <ma1ef1c> Tenet is fine
[2022-12-15 18:13:57] <%Zedaine112> pretty sure christopher nolan only has 1 movie in the top 10 on imdb 250
[2022-12-15 18:13:57] <ValiantVincent> Tenet is fine, just weird
[2022-12-15 18:13:57] <%+Cale199> the twist is Tenet was super obvious
[2022-12-15 18:13:59] <%+J4Justin2> I want to know what he was on during Tenet
[2022-12-15 18:14:00] <%Zedaine112> and it's dark knight
[2022-12-15 18:14:07] <Luis39091> Ban sirculedhel
[2022-12-15 18:14:09] <+jscullymagic> overhyped, but still good
[2022-12-15 18:14:11] <SicHoNE> how bizzare
[2022-12-15 18:14:12] <+mintyhippo67> i would bet almost all of his movies are in the imdb 250
[2022-12-15 18:14:12] <ma1ef1c> the guy goes back in time to recruit himself
[2022-12-15 18:14:13] <%Shizoko> intersteallar was a masterpiece
[2022-12-15 18:14:15] <dddddddddee> interstellar was boring
[2022-12-15 18:14:18] <+mintyhippo67> inception memento and the dark knight are for sure
[2022-12-15 18:14:22] <%+J4Justin2> Interstellar is good not my favorite ending but everything else good

[2022-12-15 18:14:32] <+paint_huffer_24_7_365> Batman vs superman was dogish
[2022-12-15 18:14:33] <f1r3st4rt3r> Tenet was actually a lot more enjoyable the second time watching it, no joke
[2022-12-15 18:14:35] <%+sirculedhel> that's Hans Zimmer not Christopher Nolan
[2022-12-15 18:14:37] <miwaloxx> interstellar best comedy movie
[2022-12-15 18:14:38] <+mintyhippo67> and none of them should be

[2022-12-15 18:15:19] <Luis39091> Oppenheimer was a good movie, specially the ending

[2022-12-15 18:49:26] <wheat4days> they are kind of overrated. it's not that they're not good movies theyre excellent but people act like theyre fkn dostoyevsky
[2022-12-15 18:49:28] <wian__> i don't like watching movies now what
[2022-12-15 18:49:31] <Menomeento> i can see why people would say pulp fiction is overrated as it is marketed as a life changing movie
[2022-12-15 18:49:38] <Menomeento> by word to mouth
[2022-12-15 18:50:00] <FooBarBazQuux> Who talks about Pulp Fiction changing your life?
[2022-12-15 18:50:04] <+xXxBlazeIt420Xx> Ass to ass:)
[2022-12-15 18:50:15] <Menomeento> as i said word to mouth
[2022-12-15 18:50:15] <%Shizoko> acting was awesome too
[2022-12-15 18:50:24] <Rondeer> it's possible that they appreciate movies that speak personally to a small audience instead of something that attracts widespread acclaim
[2022-12-15 18:50:46] <+Ruu0101> it means they hate popular shit
[2022-12-15 18:50:55] <+Ech0phantom> Same mentality that gets people to only value deep cuts from an album instead of w/e the radio single was
[2022-12-15 18:50:58] <+CeRyde> Inglourious basterds is a underrated movie
[2022-12-15 18:50:59] <Menomeento> people hype it up too much which creates a feeling of being overrated when you watch it
[2022-12-15 18:51:01] <%+J4Justin2> Pulp Fiction should be something that those people like though XD
[2022-12-15 18:51:02] <%Shizoko> cannes shit
[2022-12-15 18:51:06] <%+J4Justin2> It is so original
[2022-12-15 18:51:21] <+xXxBlazeIt420Xx> These people are movie snobs and hipsters
[2022-12-15 18:51:22] <FooBarBazQuux> Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is underrated
[2022-12-15 18:51:24] <Menomeento> not that i care movies as a medium, just pointing out why a person would think something is overrated
[2022-12-15 18:51:31] <wheat4days> thats not what it means. there are 50 movies in indb top 100 better than shawshank.
[2022-12-15 18:51:33] <Papalotapuss> did you see tarantino's original list of actors for pulp fiction? pretty interesting. would've been a totally different movie
[2022-12-15 18:51:34] <Menomeento> when  it is still good

[2022-12-15 18:55:34] <FooBarBazQuux> DD good
[2022-12-15 18:55:37] <@+Sammyraii> last GoT season was the best
[2022-12-15 18:55:39] <+mintyhippo67> donnie darko is probably underrated now
[2022-12-15 18:55:44] <+mintyhippo67> people have been shitting on it for like 20 years
[2022-12-15 18:55:47] <Luis39091> GOT is just AOT with nudes
[2022-12-15 18:55:51] <+Ruu0101> i can agree thrones went downhill but i still enjoyed it enough to watch it through 3 times lol
[2022-12-15 18:56:02] <%+J4Justin2> DD ahead of its time
[2022-12-15 18:56:11] <%+J4Justin2> at the time
[2022-12-15 18:56:15] <Rondeer> ahead of its time and ahead of Southland Tales
[2022-12-15 18:56:25] <%Shizoko> DD is timeless
[2022-12-15 18:56:43] <+mintyhippo67> idk the movie is the opposite of timeless
[2022-12-15 18:56:47] <+mintyhippo67> but it's good
[2022-12-15 18:57:00] <FooBarBazQuux> How we feelin about Teletubbies?
[2022-12-15 18:57:09] <+Arcane_Eli> scary
[2022-12-15 18:57:19] <FooBarBazQuux> most underrated horror show?
[2022-12-15 18:57:27] <+mintyhippo67> DD is purposefully a very end of the 80s movie and they blast 80s songs to make sure you know it
[2022-12-15 18:57:43] <Rondeer> Terence Malick, Lars von Trier, David Lynch are the sort of directors whose fans call movies overrated, imo
[2022-12-15 18:58:11] <+lolPoetic> he took daily vitamins
[2022-12-15 18:58:13] <+Ruu0101> matchmaking diff
