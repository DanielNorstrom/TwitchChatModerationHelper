[2022-12-15 17:07:16] <OMegaContent2> Thanks @Emongg for the drop!
[2022-12-15 17:07:17] <ddeme20> I think the skins for ramattra are only gonna get better, can't wait for a halloween skin

[2022-12-15 17:07:23] <%+CDAnimator> The crab skin looks...delicious ü¶Ä üßà
[2022-12-15 17:07:24] <%$mathmandude> Vortex def needs a height buff, but it's an easy fix. Though oddly, I think the horizontal effects of vortex were more disappointing. It doesn't feel like it works like it should. It could be patched to work like a non-Newtonian fluid: the faster you try to move through it, the more resistance there is. I feel like that's kind of how it should work. Or it could have a flat speed limit where you can't move any faster than a certain speed regardless of any ability you use.
[2022-12-15 17:07:29] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> this is very exciting
[2022-12-15 17:07:32] <tr1ckst3rcat> I thought the queues would at least be a little bit shorter now

[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <+Thenorthranger> Much like many other metas, when you need to pick a hero or be accused of throwing it gets old quick

[2022-12-15 17:40:00] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> but i think one shot meta continues
[2022-12-15 17:40:10] <Damien_Luminien> @memeking1515 I‚Äôd think that they should change hook to pull enemies to the ground, slow for a couple seconds, and prevent jumping while they are hooked. Hog can still shoot and heal while the hook is latched on, Then the hook retracts. It would eliminate his one shot pull, encourage team effort to pick hooked enemies, and give targets more options to evade death

[2022-12-15 17:51:09] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @FlowerWater_ well tbf, buffing/nerfing items enables bottom of the barrel heroes of both games. take elise for example, with the preseason jungle camp item and camps, she now has the capability to clear camps. with OW2, blizz has the time in the world in OW1 to add more heroes and they just f with up
[2022-12-15 17:51:11] <sunsetyellow> @Antarctic_Citizens I think frequent minor patches with the mid season and season intro patches being aggresive
[2022-12-15 17:51:17] <Antarctic_Citizens> The difficult thing with more patches is just a conflict with the development process... QA and patch lead time... They want to balance off data... but they released that have a 1 -2 week lock time for qa and change process.

[2022-12-15 17:53:34] <Damien_Luminien> I honestly can‚Äôt believe they buffed Sojourns ult. It was already a win-condition ult and they made it even stronger
[2022-12-15 17:53:38] <Antarctic_Citizens> so the problem is the balance philosophy blizzard wants to take... lets say a patch every 3 weeks.... that means you release a patch but you don't have data of more then a day or two of data to make balanced decisions on.

[2022-12-15 17:58:53] <HermanZeMandrak> how much heal does carnage do
[2022-12-15 17:58:56] <+ApatheticJake> @Antarctic_Citizens yeah, I'm pretty sure it's mostly in test servers
[2022-12-15 17:59:01] <+tjepp38> I'm pretty new to the game, low rank, and orisa wrecks my team everytime. Are there good counters for her?
[2022-12-15 17:59:04] <+jarrhead2> is suzu too strong then?

[2022-12-15 17:59:24] <%+DylanInSpace> @tjepp38 killing her supports first is usually best

[2022-12-15 17:59:31] <Surv1vor1993X> Anyone else‚Äôs Ramattra drops not showing up in the inventory?
[2022-12-15 17:59:33] <+dookieshoes93> @hermanzemandrak a huge carnage is the difference between being able to engage than having to run away and be off cooldown. Not huge heals but enough
[2022-12-15 17:59:35] <sarrick21> seagull's orisa was clean yesterday

[2022-12-15 18:05:02] <BananaCake395> What does the damage multiplier means? If you do 200 can you one shot a dps?
[2022-12-15 18:05:06] <ChristianSharkTV> All tanks are fun in their own way. I shall do Orisa or Sigma but Queen & Ram are definitely gonna be added to that if the buffs are good

[2022-12-15 18:06:36] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @acidface14 if you've got the mentality that it's fun to play against good players to know how you'll hold up, it's gonna be fun

[2022-12-15 18:08:05] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @kobykat6 true but that's the way game is. if you're unable to adapt or not having fun then it's time to find a different game

[2022-12-15 18:08:54] <+dookieshoes93> Javelin is top 10 abilities in the game

[2022-12-15 18:17:45] <+Drumer07> I don‚Äôt mind the cleanse or invulnerability I think it‚Äôs part of what defines the character. It just shouldn‚Äôt be so readily available. Single target could work too though. It keeps synergy with step but doesn‚Äôt make it so the whole team can get cleansed if they stack etc

[2022-12-15 19:06:01] <+NeededFriend_> Wrap hot is fine there‚Äôs literally no reason to nerf him. He already has so many counters literally his whole character just revolves around his book.
[2022-12-15 19:06:04] <jarpsyy> At least hog has some counters. Can't say the same for sojourn
[2022-12-15 19:06:07] <Geagiteerd> @wargwolfspirit just here rn. not released yet

[2022-12-15 19:06:16] <%MidLif3Crisis> i.e. Sombra nerf
[2022-12-15 19:06:16] <%+friendlyparalysisdemon> ohhh
[2022-12-15 19:06:16] <ADefiantGoose> none of my hooks ever result in a kill anyway so im already living that patch

[2022-12-15 19:06:35] <yorandomman12> Doom got 9 buffs and 3 nerfs now

[2022-12-15 19:06:46] <%+friendlyparalysisdemon> lmaoo i think that one of the main reasons why people play hog for the one shot clips
[2022-12-15 19:06:50] <gr33n_t3a_> EU already playing alot of orisa shes gonna be so strong
[2022-12-15 19:06:51] <+GKLGAMING> welp rip roadhog another tank nerfed into the ground. gonna be useless
[2022-12-15 19:06:52] <%+DriverSim> The Roadhog is bad patch KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:06:55] <%Nennai> emongDesk down with hog emongDesk
[2022-12-15 19:06:57] <%iliketoeatpineapples> supports will now live!!
[2022-12-15 19:06:57] <+NeededFriend_> No reason to change roadhog. Just because of all the new tiktokers complaining about him they making that change
[2022-12-15 19:06:59] <%floralis> let‚Äôs gooooooo
[2022-12-15 19:07:03] <Lyskir> guess roadhog trash tier onces again until he gets bufed again lel
[2022-12-15 19:07:11] <kaleebisnthere> kiriko is the problem hog did nothing wrong
[2022-12-15 19:07:12] <%RhettOfBodom> slightly less one shots EZ
[2022-12-15 19:07:13] <+mrpicklebeen> "weaker" so can still one shot 200 health ??
[2022-12-15 19:07:18] <jarpsyy> Now I'm wondering what hog even does if he doesn't one shot lol.. not that I enjoy the one shot
[2022-12-15 19:07:18] <%+Samkeisha> where can I find these notes? lol
[2022-12-15 19:07:24] <TheOneMartial> one more month of waiting till hog is nerfed Sadge
[2022-12-15 19:07:27] <%$darthoprah_> Are they gonna buff Sombra tho
[2022-12-15 19:07:28] <+meatballv> bruhhh the doom nerf????
[2022-12-15 19:07:28] <%$wasabiroot> I'd rather a low skill hero have less impact than a high skill one so I'm fine with hog nerfs
[2022-12-15 19:07:39] <+Tsaku007> @PBnicos thing is, hog usually just rises when other tanks are nerfed quite a lot and the meta is not fully defined because he kinda works. as soon as that is over he is no must pick. he wasn't before the nerfs of the other dominant tanks
[2022-12-15 19:07:45] <gr33n_t3a_> doom has so many bugs atm that need fixed
[2022-12-15 19:07:46] <fireblazewolf420> well the doom meta was nice while it lasted
[2022-12-15 19:07:53] <Paralycyst> doom right back where he started lol
[2022-12-15 19:07:57] <%Nennai> @mrpicklebeen could see it being similar to what they did with sojourn rail, make it so he almost one shots but has to deal addtional dmg
[2022-12-15 19:08:04] <Hamstra> Doom stil gonna be very good
[2022-12-15 19:08:05] <kaleebisnthere> doom F tier gg

[2022-12-15 19:08:16] <+meatballv> its one thing to nerf his passive, that‚Äôs understandable but why nerf the block? üò≠
[2022-12-15 19:08:30] <+meatballv> i understand power block is really strong but its easy to stop it
[2022-12-15 19:08:35] <+Lui003Gi> where can the patch notes be read?
[2022-12-15 19:08:40] <aggrotomate> Here can I find these patch notes?

[2022-12-15 19:10:43] <TheOneMartial> his power block will just be harder to use but this is changed isn't too bad for doom
[2022-12-15 19:10:44] <%GarikLoran_> Where are these patch notes, I can't find them?
[2022-12-15 19:10:45] <%iliketoeatpineapples> i think just reverting the block to 90 instead of increasing it to 100 is just too much of a nerf

[2022-12-15 19:11:01] <!Blizz_Craig> Hopefully Doomfist can still be a threat but can be focused down by a good team counterattack by the opponents
[2022-12-15 19:11:04] <%$wasabiroot> @r3sistor Alec Dawson, lead hero design
[2022-12-15 19:11:04] <acidface14> Pretty sure doom is in every top 10 tanks lineup lol
[2022-12-15 19:11:08] <acidface14> He is not useless
[2022-12-15 19:11:10] <qeshmer> @meatballv Yea, you can also CC but it is what is. I think ppl just aren't used to it which is an issue
[2022-12-15 19:11:12] <+meatballv> his rocket punch is still gonna be nice and in the right hands, will be playable
[2022-12-15 19:11:12] <+mrthingdude> where is this located? these notes?
[2022-12-15 19:11:13] <%iliketoeatpineapples> i can understand the 4 sec rocket punch and passive nerf but that block mit damage though
[2022-12-15 19:11:16] <ellybunnii> where can you find these patch notes? all i find is a bug list fix and winter wonderland
[2022-12-15 19:11:17] <bonehardt> JQ buffs Prayge
[2022-12-15 19:11:21] <+Sir_ELK> I didnt catch whats happening to hog are they removing the oneshot this patch or midseason?
[2022-12-15 19:11:21] <%+AutonomousTurtle> Is there a link to the patch notes?
[2022-12-15 19:11:22] <+bossfrisone> @NeededFriend_ Pretty sure tons of the OG GM's quit OW when Doom came out.  I knew a couple of them.
[2022-12-15 19:11:24] <+mrpicklebeen> @acidface14 Only in the last weeks
[2022-12-15 19:11:30] <fireblazewolf420> Doom never really bothered me as a mercy main. I just super jump up in the air and he poses no threat to me lol
[2022-12-15 19:11:33] <TheOneMartial> PauseChamp TeaTime
[2022-12-15 19:11:33] <%artboyo> but were are the Genji nerfs??
[2022-12-15 19:11:44] <+meatballv> @qeshmer yeah, it definitely is an issue of people just not being used to it. imma still stick to using him just like it was season 1 ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-12-15 19:11:45] <%iliketoeatpineapples> genji nerfs at the bottom Kappa
[2022-12-15 19:11:45] <!Blizz_Craig> @mrthingdude This is an exclusive preview, they will be published soon
[2022-12-15 19:11:45] <%Culein_> Orisa S tier
[2022-12-15 19:11:46] <%Nennai> @artboyo wait for it KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:11:48] <+mrpicklebeen> Rein and Sigma just easy counter Orisa Ult so I'm happy about this

[2022-12-15 19:12:03] <%iliketoeatpineapples> niceeeeeeeeee
[2022-12-15 19:12:03] <acidface14> @mrpicklebeen yeah but he was always viable. Ppl saying it like he wasn‚Äôt good before his buffs
[2022-12-15 19:12:07] <qeshmer> @Blizz_Craig I found it easy to run over Doom as Sigma, but even then it felt like I have way less margin of error compared to the Doom player. Good think his uptime is reduced
[2022-12-15 19:12:11] <%+sticknick55> It‚Äôs wild polarizing genii is haha
[2022-12-15 19:12:11] <+mrthingdude> @mrthingdude neat.. thx
[2022-12-15 19:12:11] <%iliketoeatpineapples> i love that buff for her primary fire

[2022-12-15 19:12:18] <+mrpicklebeen> @acidface14 I agree. He was always viable

[2022-12-15 19:12:39] <%+BobDoorbell> was Zarya nerf really that bad?
[2022-12-15 19:12:45] <%iliketoeatpineapples> and here i am practicing doom
[2022-12-15 19:12:49] <ADefiantGoose> another rein nerf no big deal. lol
[2022-12-15 19:12:49] <acidface14> Can we just skip to sojourn nerf now? Lol
[2022-12-15 19:12:53] <%iliketoeatpineapples> guess i'm still orisa main!  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-15 19:13:01] <%+DriverSim> Orisa is so much more fun to play in 2
[2022-12-15 19:13:02] <+NeededFriend_> @bossfrisone But if you think about it if it wasn‚Äôt for his recent buff there wouldn‚Äôt be any doom players. But now they‚Äôre nerfing him instead of letting him sit for a bit. When there‚Äôs others like souljorn who are still able to destroy literally anybody.
[2022-12-15 19:13:10] <trupczyk> move the patch notes or show more
[2022-12-15 19:13:10] <Paralycyst> shes gonna be a sniper now
[2022-12-15 19:13:12] <%Nennai> @BobDoorbell to her? no, but doom got buffed and nothing happened to hog, so they became meta
[2022-12-15 19:13:15] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @acidface14 hopefully yeah but dang she's the face of OW2 right now  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-15 19:13:19] <%+Windofchange13> Is the Augmented Fusion Drive her left click? Or her shift?
[2022-12-15 19:13:20] <+Sa1yanZ> alright orisa is free elo lmfao
[2022-12-15 19:13:20] <ojarrett99> I think they shouldve reverted damage blocked to 90 instead of up to 100? i think thats kind of stupid
[2022-12-15 19:13:26] <fireblazewolf420> Orisa is one of the Horse's of the apocalypse
[2022-12-15 19:13:27] <%+BobDoorbell> @nennai cohhGG

[2022-12-15 19:14:14] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @itchybanjo it's preview. it's gonna be later released
[2022-12-15 19:14:14] <%+Windofchange13> @Sir_Wolvesbane "Augmented" sounds like effect of the shift, and I was curious if that range increase only happened while shift was active.

[2022-12-15 19:14:45] <+NeededFriend_> @bossfrisone There‚Äôs counters to him though. If you have a well rounded team  and communication then doom is easy to deal with.
[2022-12-15 19:14:47] <ojarrett99> doom was okay, they couldve given him slightly more damage and a way to fight cc like every other dive tank

[2022-12-15 19:15:01] <%bill0b0b> @NightRemedy yea its like how doom slam is now just "extra damage button"
[2022-12-15 19:15:02] <greatina> The primary attack in Nemesis form should be stronger

[2022-12-15 19:17:49] <troll_ow> Why didnt the Vortex buffs?
[2022-12-15 19:17:50] <Geagiteerd> THIS ENDS NOW
[2022-12-15 19:17:53] <%Culein_> not a big nerf tbh

[2022-12-15 19:18:01] <Sesevenen> they really didnt do anything to roadhog?

[2022-12-15 19:18:02] <vawkie> Still broken Right Click
[2022-12-15 19:18:03] <gr33n_t3a_> ummmm????
[2022-12-15 19:18:05] <+meatballv> the spread should hopefully help sojourn not be as quick with the one tap. i love the disruptor shot nerf, rhat was the main thing that made sojorun irritating.

[2022-12-15 19:18:40] <+mrpicklebeen> Solider just be far, and Sojourn should be near. I like the direction
[2022-12-15 19:18:41] <+Apolla_Geez> whre can I see these patch notes?
[2022-12-15 19:18:44] <fireblazewolf420> alec has walmart wifi he cutting out a lot
[2022-12-15 19:18:46] <%Culein_> you can still charge shot with a tank
[2022-12-15 19:18:49] <%+Windofchange13> I really hope that Roadhog wasn't mentioned in the patch notes because he was deleted. Least fun hero to play against.
[2022-12-15 19:18:53] <%Culein_> still broken
[2022-12-15 19:18:53] <!Blizz_Craig> Primary fire spread is how wide the projectiles from the primary fire flies from the gun, the bigger the weaker the damage output overall
[2022-12-15 19:18:54] <+Sa1yanZ> even as a support main i dont think sojourn needed this much of a nerf
[2022-12-15 19:18:55] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @janonymous same with zarya season 1. we're gonna be "patient" for the hog "rework"
[2022-12-15 19:18:56] <+cbossthebeast> if we get closer we will just be one shotted by roadhog tho?

[2022-12-15 19:19:30] <jarpsyy> This will make Sojourn a lot worse in the metal ranks which is great imo. Blizz kept saying she wasn't a problem there but she definitely has been
[2022-12-15 19:19:31] <luazri> I don't think these Sojourn nerfs are enough
[2022-12-15 19:19:31] <kaleebisnthere> the issue I see with this is it's almost a stealth buff to disruptor in low ranks, players may not notice they are in disruptor shot now since their movement speed is unchanged

[2022-12-15 19:24:29] <%Vagnoosvensnerg> @Recklesshunter1 I don't think they are online yet
[2022-12-15 19:24:31] <+bossfrisone> @kork82 Brig = brain dead.  Ana = bae.
[2022-12-15 19:24:31] <alomebugasa> yessir fortnite

[2022-12-15 19:24:35] <jarpsyy> @Xeynium they are excited. these are all good changes. much better than s2 launch patch
[2022-12-15 19:24:38] <%VibratingPanda> Doom needs a buff
[2022-12-15 19:24:39] <dalcots69> instead of nerfing hog, make everyone OP 5head
[2022-12-15 19:24:40] <YoYoMP> since when does ana dominate the ladder? @kork82 its all mercy kiriko lucio
[2022-12-15 19:24:49] <+Saltymuffingaming> where are these patch notes at?
[2022-12-15 19:24:49] <%artboyo> @xeynium it's nice of devs to do this so can't be too mean
[2022-12-15 19:24:50] <cc22> Tracer probably going to struggle again at low elo
[2022-12-15 19:24:50] <%+rahakanariwa> nerf ana
[2022-12-15 19:24:51] <MisuWisu> Be absolutely truthful or we have to deal with this for months
[2022-12-15 19:24:51] <%Grakthis> Ana 2 shots tracer lfg
[2022-12-15 19:24:52] <%$wasabiroot> say it with me chat üëè heroes that are easy to play üëè shouldn't be better than heroes that are hard to play
[2022-12-15 19:24:54] <%Nennai> @Jokoyaki doom punch 3->4 seconds, dmg mit on block 80 -> 100 and his passive gives 35 shields
[2022-12-15 19:24:55] <vawkie> kiriko still way too strong
[2022-12-15 19:24:58] <iSwarm> no changes to hog?
[2022-12-15 19:24:58] <f1rstr1te> Whats above that i missed
[2022-12-15 19:25:00] <%artboyo> say it with me chat üëè heroes that are easy to play üëè shouldn't be better than heroes that are hard to play
[2022-12-15 19:25:01] <miggzfnbr> where  can i find these notes
[2022-12-15 19:25:03] <+Recklesshunter1> why are they buffing ana again??
[2022-12-15 19:25:06] <stinglul> get rid of suzu ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-15 19:25:07] <kork82> Ana has fan armor
[2022-12-15 19:25:10] <nuj_e> Suzu needs more nerfs
[2022-12-15 19:25:16] <+NOIIZEmusic> @iSwarm coming mid january, one shot removal
[2022-12-15 19:25:16] <%artboyo> @recklesshunter1 ml7 karq subs
[2022-12-15 19:25:19] <VonCali> When are these live?
[2022-12-15 19:25:21] <luazri> Kirkio is good for support but she's not OP
[2022-12-15 19:25:26] <YoYoMP> @artboyo so hammond should be the best tank?
[2022-12-15 19:25:26] <$schubiez> @iSwarm I think Ana buff is going to have severe impact on Hog
[2022-12-15 19:25:26] <PBnicos> @recklesshunter1 because she needs buffs
[2022-12-15 19:25:27] <Retinolgaming> Suzu has gotten like 8 other heroes changed instead of the one ability. LUL
[2022-12-15 19:25:32] <+4weirdbuff> anyone have a link to patch notes
[2022-12-15 19:25:32] <Crosis86> wheres the junkerqueen buffs smadge
[2022-12-15 19:25:33] <acidface14> That‚Äôs the last buff on the list?
[2022-12-15 19:25:33] <+Kevinakey> Hey I missed orisa changes what happened to her
[2022-12-15 19:25:35] <Knittens> So does Ana officially 1 shot tracer out of sleeps? :(((
[2022-12-15 19:25:36] <%Nennai> @schubiez I think thats the idea KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:25:39] <Sesevenen> increase the cooldown
[2022-12-15 19:25:39] <%redkakti> @Nennai emongHmm nothing crazy... i wonder if we will even feel that change KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:25:40] <%LightsAurora> Why did the official Overwatch twitter not announce this call and conversation? So many people are missing this discussion
[2022-12-15 19:25:43] <+NeededFriend_> Any junker Queen buffs
[2022-12-15 19:25:44] <acidface14> Was looking for zen kick nerf
[2022-12-15 19:25:46] <stinglul> @Retinolgaming yea classic OW devs
[2022-12-15 19:25:49] <+Apolla_Geez> link for balance changes?
[2022-12-15 19:25:54] <%Nennai> @redkakti maybe the suzu one KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:25:55] <luazri> Orisa changes are buffing her ult
[2022-12-15 19:25:55] <+NOIIZEmusic> @Kevinakey ult goes through shields, less falloff on gun
[2022-12-15 19:25:56] <miggzfnbr> where can u find these changes?
[2022-12-15 19:25:57] <poiesdon> Were there hog nerfs?
[2022-12-15 19:26:01] <%Grakthis> Ana needed a buff.  she can't defend herself and provide utility, it's one or the other, she needed a buff
[2022-12-15 19:26:08] <RustyBTD> @LightsAurora maybe they dont want to play favorites idk
[2022-12-15 19:26:09] <VonCali> @poiesdon no but some are coming
[2022-12-15 19:26:11] <jarpsyy> kiriko is still the strongest support due to the nature of her kit but she is becoming more and more balanced
[2022-12-15 19:26:15] <+Akyurem> what about Junker Queen
[2022-12-15 19:26:15] VIEWERS: 4¬†995
[2022-12-15 19:26:22] <YoYoMP> flats "I like the way youre making small changes" ???????
[2022-12-15 19:26:26] <%LightsAurora> @RustyBTD so... they play favorites by not telling anyone they're playing favorites?
[2022-12-15 19:26:28] <acidface14> Dont sleep on bap tho
[2022-12-15 19:26:29] <+bossfrisone> @jarpsyy Her kit just doesn't make sense to me for some reason.
[2022-12-15 19:26:30] <vawkie> i wish there was more, but this isn't bad
[2022-12-15 19:26:30] <luazri> Hog changes are not coming this patch
[2022-12-15 19:26:30] <%redkakti> @redkakti oh that definitely KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:26:31] <kitsie_> why are they only delicate with supports and not other roles?
[2022-12-15 19:26:31] <x_redhoodx> WTF is this patch? no Hog nerfs?
[2022-12-15 19:26:31] <Crosis86> junker queen =(
[2022-12-15 19:26:32] <miggzfnbr> please where can i find these changes and read for myself

[2022-12-15 19:26:42] <Colin731> @x_redhoodx mid jan
[2022-12-15 19:26:43] <%LightsAurora> @RustyBTD at least not ahead of time, they're doing surprise playing favorites
[2022-12-15 19:26:44] <%AstroCha0s> Not sure dropping Suzu from 1 sec to .85 secs is going to make support feel good - it's just going to make players have to adjust timing again - but sure

[2022-12-15 19:27:16] <+Saltymuffingaming> Is there somewhere to read theses? I came in late, and these arent on the website
[2022-12-15 19:27:19] <Grav__> Chat when do these changes drop

[2022-12-15 19:27:28] <RustyBTD> Junker Queen got no love, except for the suzu nerf. tough luck
[2022-12-15 19:27:29] <MisuWisu> Game is doomed
[2022-12-15 19:27:33] <kernel9> where the junker queen buffs?
[2022-12-15 19:27:34] <aleague13> I'd like to see a favorite option for skins and random skin option so I can cycle through my favorites
[2022-12-15 19:27:35] <$Scaarecrow> Wonder if Kiriko's teleport cooldown should be like ball grapple on spawn
[2022-12-15 19:27:37] <+novusprime25> @Emongg Ask about Brig please Mr Strimmer? :)
[2022-12-15 19:27:42] <ncclayton116> When is the patch?
[2022-12-15 19:27:44] <%$wasabiroot> hog getting a dedicated rework patch in January
[2022-12-15 19:27:45] <+nothinggood27> So, Ana/Orisa meta? KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:27:46] <+BK_III> How about bans for Cheaters, Throwers, etc...? So many leavers per games and backfilling into 5 second losses...
[2022-12-15 19:27:46] <+themicson> I think Suzu should be back to 1sec duration and just not cleansing debuffs.
[2022-12-15 19:27:47] <+NOIIZEmusic> @Luka___Tim shes mega nerfed all together now. No more one shot, no slow, wider spread, slower cd on slide
[2022-12-15 19:27:50] <RandomGuy9O9> did they do anything to hog?
[2022-12-15 19:27:50] <%Vagnoosvensnerg> @ncclayton116 Later today or tomorrow

[2022-12-15 19:32:29] <+mrpicklebeen> @chillCOFFEEvibes game dev
[2022-12-15 19:32:31] <PBJammy> I think it's good that they are looking to make changes like these early in a season. Set's precedent
[2022-12-15 19:32:31] <neighborhoodspiderman21> Hogies lives
[2022-12-15 19:32:34] <+nothinggood27> @MavillaGorilla I think it will actually help, suzu length reduction leads to less healing and more damage to the target, so lots of breakpoints!
[2022-12-15 19:32:35] <Recury> mid jan
[2022-12-15 19:32:35] <%LightsAurora> Hey @Emongg, let them know that they should've at least tweeted about this conversation, I missed all but the last 5 minutes and that is really frustrating
[2022-12-15 19:32:41] <Barkh4n> woah
[2022-12-15 19:32:41] <TheCapDavid> oh hell yes
[2022-12-15 19:32:46] <TrinityTV94> epic
[2022-12-15 19:32:46] <flannelmonke> wait that's pretty huge
[2022-12-15 19:32:49] <Grav__> WHAT
[2022-12-15 19:32:49] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-15 19:33:03] <%bolbi_in_canada> He said reduced ability to one shot not completely impossible
[2022-12-15 19:33:03] <%+Windofchange13> THANK GOODNESS. Such an unfun hero to play against, especially with suzu to counter his counter.
[2022-12-15 19:33:05] <+mrpicklebeen> Didn't he say there might not be a one shot. So reduce damage slightly
[2022-12-15 19:33:05] <neighborhoodspiderman21> Not hogies. Lol
[2022-12-15 19:33:06] <%Saraxx> KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:33:09] <+MsMaomao> hmmmm roadhog has always been the two piece combo master. i wonder how theyll change it so he still feels like roadhog
[2022-12-15 19:33:09] <TrinityTV94> finally i wont be getting jumpscared by hog when playing support :^)
[2022-12-15 19:33:09] <xGooodluck> RIPBOZO HOG
[2022-12-15 19:33:10] <+NOIIZEmusic> @apotatobird these changes today or tomorrow, roadhog in january
[2022-12-15 19:33:10] <%$mathmandude> I asked for 10% speed for ram and they gave 20%
[2022-12-15 19:33:13] <%7thSea> rip p1tp1g :(
[2022-12-15 19:33:15] <%$janonymous> I'm surprised they didn't throw a small nerf in for this patch
[2022-12-15 19:33:17] <tapwaterperson> L HOG
[2022-12-15 19:33:21] <+Tasta08> HOG DELETED COGGERS
[2022-12-15 19:33:21] <ChristianSharkTV> Did he say NO one shot or just that it‚Äôs harder to get? Because he sounded like he wanted to correct you there @emongg
[2022-12-15 19:33:22] <%+tm_901> should have asked about ball
[2022-12-15 19:33:25] <myseglis> why not nerf him today then
[2022-12-15 19:33:26] <hypobromite> they need to give more help to hog's teammates
[2022-12-15 19:33:28] <+mrpicklebeen> Did he specifically say it won't be able to one shot? @Emongg not even on tracer
[2022-12-15 19:33:28] <+fingerpoppin99> Can one shot anything?
[2022-12-15 19:33:29] <%AstroCha0s> Oh thank god
[2022-12-15 19:33:30] <%+BigRobDidIt> Means nothing to me since I couldn't One shot with hog anyway LUL
[2022-12-15 19:33:31] <Barkh4n> nerfed into the damn groun
[2022-12-15 19:33:31] <iPRIxMAi> I cannot believe you didn't ask about ball
[2022-12-15 19:33:33] <+fingerpoppin99> Cant*
[2022-12-15 19:33:33] <LaBaguette223> So his primary fire does less damage?
[2022-12-15 19:33:34] <%SpookyAzul> dont even bother with the rework, just make hog unplayable and call it a day
[2022-12-15 19:33:34] <flood_33> Oh no all the Hog players throwing my games after the nerf NotLikeThis
[2022-12-15 19:33:35] <ArcaneLight> that alone will put 60% of people q's for tanks LUL
[2022-12-15 19:33:35] <%Culein_> so we have to play hog all month now
[2022-12-15 19:33:36] <+n3z_type_9_star> scroll

[2022-12-15 19:33:37] <Sir_Wolvesbane> No Mercy changes good
[2022-12-15 19:33:38] <a0ri> those Doomfist changes look pretty lackluster, but I guess we will have to see
[2022-12-15 19:33:40] <%+Jokoyaki> how good is doom with the new patch notes?
[2022-12-15 19:33:40] <Sesevenen> hanzo bug fixed?
[2022-12-15 19:33:41] <%artboyo> @bigrobdidit LUL
[2022-12-15 19:33:41] <+NeededFriend_> So basically the only fun tanks left are rein and orisa
[2022-12-15 19:33:41] <%apotatobird> Are these changes besides for hog coming soon?
[2022-12-15 19:33:41] <+nothinggood27> @LightsAurora you're right, but should be able to go to the VOD to review :)
[2022-12-15 19:33:42] <flannelmonke> @myseglis he just said they cant do those nerfs in the hotfix
[2022-12-15 19:33:42] <%Nennai> @ChristianSharkTV could see it being like what they did with sojourn rail
[2022-12-15 19:33:42] <+ChuckIGuess> any lucio chanmges he spilled?
[2022-12-15 19:33:45] <+Meddraut> hog hook just should have had range shortened
[2022-12-15 19:33:45] <+AnxiousDev> is this already live?
[2022-12-15 19:33:48] <TheCuddlySpartan> what time is patch? 2pm est?
[2022-12-15 19:33:50] <%Nennai> @ChuckIGuess nope
[2022-12-15 19:33:51] <thegoodness603> What about Junker Queen?
[2022-12-15 19:33:58] <yeetmcduggy> no more roady one shot?
[2022-12-15 19:34:05] <+AndtheMGs> @Emongg did you talk about Ball at all?
[2022-12-15 19:34:06] <%Nennai> power block didnt need another nerf imo
[2022-12-15 19:34:09] <%+jinjerbear> Hello Caleb!!!
[2022-12-15 19:34:13] <Minaloc> @ChuckIGuess what do you think could be changed, just curious, dont think they said anything
[2022-12-15 19:34:16] VIEWERS: 5¬†077
[2022-12-15 19:34:17] <+nothinggood27> @thegoodness603 no change yet but a tease to future buffs that are more substantial
[2022-12-15 19:34:17] <%+Trunksies> so excited about junker queen
[2022-12-15 19:34:23] <Hedennina> @thegoodness603 She's getting changes mid season. Devs said the changes will be "spicy"
[2022-12-15 19:34:23] <Crosis86> can use nemesis form to run away tech if u need to
[2022-12-15 19:34:32] <%$wasabiroot> I think the doom nerf is more a rocket punch nerf than a block nerf
[2022-12-15 19:34:35] <+NakiKataki> It seemed like he didn't want to explicitly say "no oneshot" but wanted to say it'd be way less powerful
[2022-12-15 19:34:44] <hypobromite> no spread until 9th shot though, right?
[2022-12-15 19:34:45] <vahl0x> mini heart attack, thought that said speed not spread
[2022-12-15 19:34:47] <+EfnMD> SHe used to be a lazer while soldier was awful lol
[2022-12-15 19:34:52] <+MayorOfTocsin> no longer slowing enemies with her bubble is a MASSIVE nerf
[2022-12-15 19:34:52] <flannelmonke> so is this hotfix coming today? @Emongg
[2022-12-15 19:34:52] <SkandarSan> I‚Äôm lost‚Ä¶ is Roadhog getting nerfed?
[2022-12-15 19:34:54] <+ChuckIGuess> @ChuckIGuess I think he could use his self heal back to where it was
[2022-12-15 19:34:57] <Retinolgaming> @Emongg Why are they changing like 6 heroes that are being enabled/disabled by kiriko's suzu instead of just changing suzu?
[2022-12-15 19:34:58] <arkyroz> SOUJURN DEAD ?! Kreygasm PogChamp PogChamp
[2022-12-15 19:35:01] <+RachellaaTV> Ana buffs!!!!
[2022-12-15 19:35:02] <+AnxiousDev> @SkandarSan it will, not now
[2022-12-15 19:35:03] <+BK_III> The Anna fix is just putting her damage/heal numbers back where they were two years ago
[2022-12-15 19:35:07] <%$wasabiroot> @skandarsan he's getting reworked in january
[2022-12-15 19:35:08] <the_oz> Sojourn spread will only be a nerf at low elo
[2022-12-15 19:35:09] <%+Trunksies> @thegoodness603 he said she will be buffed mid season and it's going to be "spicy"
[2022-12-15 19:35:15] <flannelmonke> that is a very good change
[2022-12-15 19:35:16] <luazri> why didn't they nerf Genji? weird
[2022-12-15 19:35:20] <Minaloc> @ChuckIGuess ahh yeah I could see that
[2022-12-15 19:35:22] <itsjukebox_> ANA CAN 2 SHOT TRACERS NOW LFG
[2022-12-15 19:35:25] <TheCapDavid> Good
[2022-12-15 19:35:29] <+MayorOfTocsin> disruptor was a guaranteed 1v1 win before this is much better
[2022-12-15 19:35:36] <i_am_bilal> hog nerf too?
[2022-12-15 19:35:40] <SkandarSan> I was being sarcastic guys. But love the love
[2022-12-15 19:35:46] <+BK_III> @itsjukebox_ seriously... finally
[2022-12-15 19:35:53] <%$wasabiroot> emongVibe

[2022-12-15 19:35:59] <ShaiHuludBlessHisWater> Genji?
[2022-12-15 19:35:59] <acidface14> Ana lowkey is a crazy nerf she was pretty balanced aside from movement
[2022-12-15 19:36:02] <%+Trunksies> do you think they should have buffed vortex though?
[2022-12-15 19:36:05] <%Nennai> @Retinolgaming imagine changing an already exisiting skill and having to balance that around 38 other heroes instead of balance the existing one thats enabling 6
[2022-12-15 19:36:06] <+nothinggood27> @Retinolgaming they DID change suzu, there's not much to do in a hotfix
[2022-12-15 19:36:09] <+mrthingdude> what does 5.5 round to? up or down?
[2022-12-15 19:36:11] <+ukeitupp> Links to patch notes?

[2022-12-15 19:38:45] <+Steph_You_Up> Hog changes cannot be hot fixes. these are just number changes. They'll probably remove Hogs one hit combo and make it so he is more about displacement with his hook

[2022-12-15 19:40:18] <%urban69ing08> ro3d p1g fieels pretty good problem is most other tanks feel awful to play.
[2022-12-15 19:40:21] <DiscordedKarma> what are the Roaghog changes?
[2022-12-15 19:40:21] <Retinolgaming> Hog is so hard to balance, if he cant 1 shot he is worthless.
[2022-12-15 19:40:23] <TomRockamora> Is that in reference to his hook/melee?
[2022-12-15 19:40:25] <deceivertwin> i like how hog was useless for years and now that he's meta for like a month he's losing his main function and getting nerfed into the ground again
[2022-12-15 19:40:27] <+Jakemer07> how do i get the gingerbread bastion skin
[2022-12-15 19:40:31] <%$wasabiroot> ball is in a weird spot because he's actually pretty good but doesn't vibe well in 5v5. with his shields he gets up to 1300 ehp and is basically unkillable. so I imagine they want to be careful with ball
[2022-12-15 19:40:40] <+ca26eb> @emongg I missed the notes. will there be a vod soon.
[2022-12-15 19:40:41] <+ech0cide> @deceivertwin yup, it's garbage
[2022-12-15 19:40:41] <+GreyFalcon1> my guess with Hog, they just change how close the hook pulls to like 7m
[2022-12-15 19:40:42] <MisuWisu> Any Ball changes?

[2022-12-15 19:41:55] <deceivertwin> @deceivertwin all they had to do was nerf his self heal and maybe make his hook have shorter range so he's harder to 1-shot. But nah, let's rework him
[2022-12-15 19:41:58] <+ech0cide> @AndtheMGs nah, people don't think about the consequences of a nerf, they just whine until it happens, then whine until the next thing gets nerfed

[2022-12-15 19:51:16] <%+baggadyx> Mid-season patch also has JQ buffs <3
[2022-12-15 19:51:17] <+healerdiff88> does the 25% affect his ult too?
[2022-12-15 19:51:36] <%+baggadyx> For Ram? It's a 20% movement increase and yeah it affects ult.
[2022-12-15 19:51:38] <+radkab> ml7 is mad
[2022-12-15 19:51:39] <owenxk> so this is obscure but does anyone else notice ramatra doesnt have vibrate for his weapons on console?
[2022-12-15 19:51:39] <%+rahakanariwa> guess it's time to uninstall

[2022-12-15 19:53:11] <%$janonymous> When it says pierce shields - does it just go through them entirely or damage shields first, then continue
[2022-12-15 19:53:18] <Nersicah> so I can no longer hold my Rein shield in Orisa's face when she ults?
[2022-12-15 19:53:19] <Paralycyst> that means try Orissa ULT goes through zary bubb too?
[2022-12-15 19:53:28] <%TheNastyFridge> @janonymous It does both IIRC, it goes through them, but also damages them
[2022-12-15 19:53:35] <%+DylanInSpace> @Paralycyst nah nothing damages zarya when bubble is up
[2022-12-15 19:53:43] <Paralycyst> got it makes sense
[2022-12-15 19:53:48] <%Nennai> @Paralycyst probably not considering pummel doesnt

[2022-12-15 19:54:40] <%+baggadyx> That seems lame. I would've thought bubble would block it.
[2022-12-15 19:54:40] <Crosis86> @Emongg it will go through sym wall now

[2022-12-15 19:55:02] <%+DylanInSpace> It'll probably "go through it" in the sense it'll hit people behind whoever is bubbled, but not the person that's actually bubbled
[2022-12-15 19:55:02] <ChristianSharkTV> Yeah his vortex was the one thing I really wanted buff
[2022-12-15 19:55:03] <aomaryllis> Good changes tbh

[2022-12-15 19:55:31] <%Nennai> well pummel is "piercing" but doesnt hit zarya in the bubble, not anyone behind a mei wall, so I imagine those would still block orisa ult

[2022-12-15 20:51:33] <!%blizz_winter> Not hotfixable.

[2022-12-15 20:51:40] <+Slashoom> no notes anywhere for this?
[2022-12-15 20:51:43] <sunsetyellow> I imagine an animation means adjusting assets
[2022-12-15 20:51:44] <+Zaldryc> @juliusqhl its been 2 seconds
[2022-12-15 20:51:47] <henrizzle> itt looks so gross
[2022-12-15 20:51:50] <noneckgiraffen> what's wrong with hanzo?
[2022-12-15 20:51:51] <hornetdabug> when are you gonna stop streaming?
[2022-12-15 20:51:53] <djrocks3921> what are the doom nerfs?
[2022-12-15 20:51:55] <iseky> its sp icky
[2022-12-15 20:51:55] <markittystuff> Wait so hog won't get nerfed until next month?
[2022-12-15 20:52:03] <+Slashoom> was tracer nerf just to her recall?
[2022-12-15 20:52:05] <+Sneaks> Im still surprised Suzu is at a 14sec CD with Ana sleep dart
[2022-12-15 20:52:07] <flamboyant__1> Hot messes are not hot fixable ;)
[2022-12-15 20:52:08] <%$Schutkleur> I got applying update bug :( Restart didnt fix it
[2022-12-15 20:52:21] <%+RouzenSSM> said they can only change numbers and other small tweaks
[2022-12-15 20:52:23] <capt197> do they have patch notes for the hotfix?
[2022-12-15 20:52:28] <+Acerx101> Where's the notes?
[2022-12-15 20:52:29] <%TheNastyFridge> @Slashoom No, tracer got a nerf to her damage, it went from 6 per bullet to 5.5 emongHmm
[2022-12-15 20:52:29] <neurosoma> @Schutkleur having a lot of leavers rn, I think its common
[2022-12-15 20:52:32] <+kushinboots420> sojourn nerfs are not enough lol
[2022-12-15 20:52:32] <%+nothinggood27> @Schutkleur did you restart the launcher?

[2022-12-15 20:52:35] <SickQuilver> my game got stuck when updating
[2022-12-15 20:52:41] <hawaiiansh1rtday> Yeah like its easier to update a database setting (hot fix) and not as easy to update an animation
[2022-12-15 20:52:41] <sunsetyellow> stuff like bits and number values are probably what can get hot fixed
[2022-12-15 20:52:42] <Purplesun_> Basically if you can do it in custom games you don't need a full patch
[2022-12-15 20:52:46] <yeetodafeeto> Overwatch finally acted like a live service game for once

[2022-12-15 20:55:05] <%Vent0_> the slow removal is good, the other 2 changes on sojourn seem completely useless tbh, her ttk is probably increased by 0.2s. with that spread you're still hitting the tank to charge shot... so it feels kinda meh
[2022-12-15 20:55:05] <JustMartin2004> @pattymac25 just restart your game
[2022-12-15 20:55:17] <veeus> soujorn at long range feels funny

[2022-12-15 21:01:50] <+Punky_Brewmeister> I feel like Q should cancel the ult not Shift
[2022-12-15 21:01:52] <MattyTheBoi> Any links to the patch notes?
[2022-12-15 21:01:54] <halimtech> you can cancel ult wtf
[2022-12-15 21:01:54] <SPREE> this makes me happy too
[2022-12-15 21:02:00] <mguardian09> Is that tank good? @emongg
[2022-12-15 21:02:02] <thatbbytwink> its bc you can get out of nemesis mode
[2022-12-15 21:02:07] <thatbbytwink> and that cancels ult
[2022-12-15 21:02:09] <%+ronn5451> @ColonelBT not yet, but emongg went through it earlier on stream
[2022-12-15 21:02:13] <!%blizz_winter> @KAVE_M4N So that he can place shield to block things like dva bomb and Cass ult that would kill his team.
[2022-12-15 21:02:19] <+lucebree> @KAVE_M4N so she can swap to range and shield. she could cancel the block shatter
[2022-12-15 21:02:19] <tempdr> does his speed boost stack with kitsune?
[2022-12-15 21:02:20] <ColonelBT> @ColonelBT ok thanks
[2022-12-15 21:02:20] <thatbbytwink> they shouod make it so you cant toggle during ult
[2022-12-15 21:02:27] <%+nothinggood27> @KAVE_M4N so you can flip back to ranged attack if someone is getting away
[2022-12-15 21:02:27] <Forsakei> I personally don't think that Ram's ult should last forever when someone is in it. Rather, maybe it halves the rate of consumption for every person in it?

[2022-12-15 21:03:18] <Buizeru> Shield blocking it helps though, you can just avoid the ult effect and let it drain

[2022-12-15 21:13:00] <Sesevenen> if you altf4 while ulting does it heal the whole team?
[2022-12-15 21:13:07] <Buizeru> I think removing speed from Disruptor is a bit weird. Like why not make it 15% like Symmetra's turret? It seems odd to just do away with it entirely.
[2022-12-15 21:13:15] <fakekeks> @Sesevenen it won't help in comp anyway

[2022-12-15 21:14:15] <ChristianSharkTV> See & I feel like that spread actually balances well for low rank since they usually play more close range anyway

[2022-12-15 22:16:26] <dulkintuu> did orisa really need buffs doe

[2022-12-15 22:21:05] <%+Damnitbinks> @Damnitbinks Ahhhh fair enough. I was thinking wait Ana has been a pretty good balanced hero for the last few patches. But that does make sense though.
[2022-12-15 22:21:20] <%ne0n_black> I'm not a support player I just want ana to be viable. Tracer genji sombra etc etc will still have a good matchup into ana. Ana just has a chance now

[2022-12-15 22:30:36] <%ne0n_black> I think sojourn is much more balanced in lower ranks now. This patch didnt really address mercy+sojourn one shotting still, which will dominate high level play
[2022-12-15 22:30:53] <%ne0n_black> maybe the increased cooldown on the slide helps kill sojourn like what they did with widow grapple nerf?

[2022-12-15 22:32:49] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-15 22:33:26] <%ne0n_black> the mobility nerf goes a really long way. Winston is arguably the strongest sojourn counter and his mobility is now on a 2 sec shorter cooldown than sojourn. With hog likely taking a back seat, winston can more reliably deal with a sojourn

[2022-12-15 23:37:34] <%+fschabd> push is better than 2cp no question for me
[2022-12-15 23:37:40] <therakiat97> you are being unironic?
[2022-12-15 23:37:54] <littlenomadoo> @fschabd everything is better than 2cp lol
[2022-12-15 23:38:01] <huntergansey> push maps are ugly, at least the 2 cp maps had character
[2022-12-15 23:38:09] <+BuenPoco> they both suck
[2022-12-15 23:38:11] <%michimochii> 2 cp was awful but push feels no better üò©
[2022-12-15 23:38:17] <%michimochii> They both need reworking
[2022-12-15 23:38:22] <%+fschabd> @huntergansey that I can agree with I miss hanamra just to look at stuff lol
[2022-12-15 23:38:24] <goto_fge> SeemsGood
[2022-12-15 23:38:26] <GreysDraws> i hate push so much
[2022-12-15 23:38:30] <huntergansey> i think 2cp would feel a lot better with 5v5 though
[2022-12-15 23:38:34] <+kamikazekittiez> I actually like the push maps lol
[2022-12-15 23:38:42] <littlenomadoo> at least push is dynamic
[2022-12-15 23:38:43] <shadowkatcher1> push is ok, but it'd be better if long range characters weren't all 10√ó better on those maps
[2022-12-15 23:38:47] <%Presarius712> push is better because of the forward spawns
[2022-12-15 23:38:48] <%michimochii> Push feels like more running than 2cp
[2022-12-15 23:38:50] <+kamikazekittiez> it's just fun

[2022-12-15 23:56:54] <%Nennai> wait we got the 40 elims?!? WOWERS
[2022-12-15 23:57:07] <Type_etoile> !patch
[2022-12-15 23:57:08] <@%^StreamElements> New balance patch is out NOW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sd-2_H1Wdg
[2022-12-15 23:57:08] <declaring_intent> Is this hero just a better version of Sigma?
[2022-12-15 23:57:09] <+Mike2621> I like that his nemesis is basically a self speed boost now, less tanks are reliant on Lucio and I think that‚Äôs a good thing

[2022-12-15 23:57:42] <%greg0409> @Em__K Exactly. Id rather they revert the spread and make the railgun not crit lol
[2022-12-15 23:57:44] <Bbistheman21> 20% kind of feels like it may have been overkill
[2022-12-15 23:57:46] <%$Marwa_HAW> peepoAngy why so balanced

[2022-12-15 23:57:57] <canadianplatypus> @greg0409 yea that's unfortunate. Take away one part of her and her rail gun is her only thing. Should have done the opposite

[2022-12-15 23:58:23] <+Em__K> @greg0409 yeah they could easily just nerf the railgun. no reason it should be able to one-shot people, especially when you need to damage with her primary to charge it
[2022-12-15 23:58:26] <Type_etoile> rammatra nemesis Movespeed is LIT
[2022-12-15 23:58:32] <%greg0409> @canadianplatypus and like, it feels BAD even aiming well you just miss because spread. I hate spread in games
[2022-12-15 23:58:44] <Mapleer> @Type_etoile he was running with lucio lol
[2022-12-15 23:58:48] <%N30NxL1T3x> now you will suffer as..... Bedge
[2022-12-15 23:58:58] <canadianplatypus> @greg0409 such an odd choice to screw with the spread
[2022-12-15 23:59:01] <+Em__K> @greg0409 preaching to the choir.  cheapest and worst way to nerf a gun ever
[2022-12-15 23:59:05] <+Mike2621> We‚Äôll Ana definitely looks stronger now lol
[2022-12-15 23:59:13] <shvagroos> bastion is a way to go now lol, no spread
[2022-12-15 23:59:16] <+crazybigfoot28> i thought ana was fienbefore
