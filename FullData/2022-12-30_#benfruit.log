[2022-12-30 12:56:26] <%+SaberTSGaming> @TheSausageContinuim Yeah I seen that and that sucks man but tbh CyberpunkVR has a lot of bugs just like FalloutVR and a few others so you have to download mods and config your games to get it working proper. Fallout 4 VR works great now for me after the tweaks
