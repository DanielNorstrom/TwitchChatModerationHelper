[2023-01-02 14:53:40] <%Warfiend81> the process they go through to get the milk from stuff is crazy
[2023-01-02 14:53:41] <@%$heavymetalrules> soy is lowkey trash
[2023-01-02 14:53:43] <%maomolinaaa> never taste it
[2023-01-02 14:53:43] <%CowboyAquatica> if they call the pond a tank ITS NOT A POND its a reservoir

[2023-01-02 14:54:10] <@%$heavymetalrules> almond is prob my fave alternative milk
[2023-01-02 14:54:14] <glaxxoc> all non dairy milks have seed oils which are so so so bad for the body
[2023-01-02 14:54:16] <mylittlechap> do you drink tea or coffee??
[2023-01-02 14:54:18] <@%$heavymetalrules> pea protein is the best food wise
[2023-01-02 14:54:18] <+Fromac40n9> soy is bearable with flavoring for me, but oat milk is pretty good
[2023-01-02 14:54:22] <%+Splattercatt> I once convinced my best friend that Kentucky Fried chicken genetically modified their chickens to have three legs. that's why you always got more drumsticks in buckets. He didn't find out until like, 15 years later that it wasn't true when he tried to tell someone else. :D
[2023-01-02 14:54:23] <%6books> oat milk

[2023-01-02 14:54:23] <!%$Tonez2111> i got buffering during that whole part of almond milk   why is it bad?
[2023-01-02 14:54:29] <%techmanalbin> exactly...enjoy eating...don't do volume
[2023-01-02 14:54:30] <%Ddroppded> Unsweetened almond milk NODDERS
[2023-01-02 14:54:33] <%$Double_Dees_> I saw a thing the other day arguing against the anti meat movement, saying that growing tofu means the farmer has to kill all voles, moles, mice, insects, etc, etc and so is worse for the environment and more is killed
[2023-01-02 14:54:39] <%maomolinaaa> three leg chicken lol
[2023-01-02 14:54:41] <+MagikLimbo> imagine wasting almonds that could be eaten fresh just to make milk
[2023-01-02 14:54:45] <!%$AmontilladoWolf> I thought you gave up the cinussy
[2023-01-02 14:54:47] <@%BadGamerDan> the proper cinussy or the knock off?
[2023-01-02 14:54:51] <%+qorrect> @Tonez2111 Almonds take tons of water, and California doesnt have much but they farm it anyway because money

[2023-01-02 14:55:44] <rollinupdabs> i trust in Gods creation ,i eat animals ,fruits n cashews, n fresh veggies
[2023-01-02 14:55:49] <%techmanalbin> plant based is really because we can't raise enough to feed everyone
[2023-01-02 14:55:52] <D3DT3CHNO> But most soy is grown for animal feed... That argument makes no sense.
[2023-01-02 14:55:59] <@%$heavymetalrules> vegan food is a lot better than it was
[2023-01-02 14:56:08] <%CowboyAquatica> i want to eat waygu steak butt naked ontop of a moutain, thats not for everyone

[2023-01-02 15:00:47] <%Warfiend81> I think the only time your body is going to outright reject meat is if you've gone a really long time without meat and then go immediately to the greasiest and fattiest meat right away the first time

[2023-01-02 15:30:08] <+PhilomathMike> Honestly, it's because that's the cheapest area to live. They can't afford leaving, but their homes aren't destroyed every year or few years. A lot of the worst areas hit are trailer parks.

[2023-01-02 16:34:37] <@%$InfinityKitty51> When I worked at a car shop in upstate NY. I met more customers that were in their 40s and 50s with their first vehicle and just learned how to drive. They were all from NYC. You cant justify paying upwards of $500+ a month to just park your car somewhere
[2023-01-02 16:34:45] <%+Cwarner312> you must be a pro at looking at bus/train maps
