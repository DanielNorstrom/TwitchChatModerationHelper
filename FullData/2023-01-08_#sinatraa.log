[2023-01-08 06:57:26] <@^Nightbot> contract with Sentinels ended 1/2/2023, Sinatraa is no longer with Sentinels. He has no plans of competing again
[2023-01-08 06:57:29] <%QUOTE_IF_HIKO_BALD> You'll see Sinatraa taking full advantage of Phoenix's recent buff on the Pearl map, as well as teaming up with Sharky and Guard Trent in duo queue. With expert use of Phoenix's abilities, such as Firewall, Flashpoint, Hot Hands, and Run It Back, and impeccable game sense, Sinatraa consistently comes out on top in ranked matches.

Do you abbreviate apple juice too? " Hey yeah, let me have some AJ?" - said by no one ever. I just think it sound annoying *** Edit: I don't have any issues with abbreviations, except for OJ as orange juice. Sorry if I offended some of you with sensitive feelings.

After three straight incidents of his behavior recently, I have disowned him. He is no longer a son of mine. I urge a boycott of Sentinels until they begin behaving like respectable men again.
