[2022-12-02 15:49:18] <%thewolfman22> I just started with twitch
[2022-12-02 15:49:18] <%kirberbert> vtubing be hard lol
[2022-12-02 15:49:22] <%Zanpa> yes now there is
[2022-12-02 15:49:26] <%DJSayori> I remember when i just started out  got raided with 250 viewers, and ii was just surprised and tried to entertain djsayoLol
[2022-12-02 15:49:26] <%+xMASTRYx> I raid people I follow, and somewhere where I want to relax and watch their content.
[2022-12-02 15:49:30] <%KisaiTenshi> yeah you can turn it off or set a raid size limit
[2022-12-02 15:49:31] <%+racoonwithmatches> I think the point of a raid is to help another streamer - sometimes your raid can be harmful (even if unintentionally)
[2022-12-02 15:49:32] <%Spacekivvi> Yeah but they learn by experience
[2022-12-02 15:49:32] <nitemare96> yeah you can disable it
[2022-12-02 15:49:33] <@%CptTinko> yeah, they added those a couple of months back

[2022-12-02 15:49:46] <%GrayOfSloth> you can set minimum and maximum amounts for raids your channel can recieve

[2022-12-02 15:49:52] <deltib> raids are such a big avenue for growth on twitch, though.
[2022-12-02 15:49:53] <scienceteam_member> how does one become a streamer without experiencing the stream culture first KEKW
[2022-12-02 15:50:01] <+neoninjax07> yeah theres also fear of follow botting and hate raids too
[2022-12-02 15:50:08] <Rubi_Dragon> @AiCandii oh god, i'm reminded of my first ever raid while playing warframe a while back, had 80 people raid into me monkaS
