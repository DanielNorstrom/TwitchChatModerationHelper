[2022-12-10 01:23:25] <@%^StreamElements> girldmHuh Mistress, I noticed you haven't read any of my previous 20 messages out loud despite my name taking up over 70% of the chatbox at any given time. I can see your model turning to read chat so I know you're purposely ignoring me. Mistress, is something wrong? girldmHuh

[2022-12-10 01:50:59] <@%^StreamElements> I’m canceling my tier 3 sub. 3 years, dm. 3 years I donated to you, moderated your chat and kept the scum at bay. 3 years of asking you how your day is, defending your honor in chat and even on Twitter. 3 years… wasted. You danced right out of my life… and my heart. I’ve just followed rosedoodle, so long, dm. Hope it was worth it.

[2022-12-10 02:16:28] <@%^StreamElements> I am the fear of my panic. anxiety is my body, and fright is my blood. I have survived over a thousand jumpscares. Unknown to calm, nor known to composure. Have withstood poise to create many dreads yet those hands shall never hold anything. so, as I pray, unlimited panic works

[2022-12-10 03:47:50] <%ProvokedTree> @iammean15 When he grows up he is half t rex half battle tank. So I agree how could anyone be afraid of something so awesome

[2022-12-10 03:51:23] <%ProvokedTree> Seriously though the whole "our digimon aren't going to eat us" would be a lot easier if Falcomon didn't have two full sets of teeth in that beak of his

[2022-12-10 03:51:48] <DistantOne> I don't really get the logic. YES they saw someone die, but they also saw that same person be extremely toxic and abusive to the digimon that killed him, a digimon that clearly lost control of itself.

[2022-12-10 03:53:10] <%+bluedude153> Chat as far as they know these are just Yokai. The digimon also dont know the things they usually know
[2022-12-10 03:53:17] <DistantOne> I guess I have a hard time putting myself in their mindset because I have enjoyed digimon for a very long time.
[2022-12-10 03:53:27] <%$Bazeio> girldmWah At least Falcomon is logical

[2022-12-10 03:54:27] <%RussHoff70> also digimon are never really the most put together themselves. most have the mentality of teenagers

[2022-12-10 03:54:38] <Kuroji_Zillax> You think the rent is reasonable?
[2022-12-10 03:54:41] <%barrettsmithbb> But the rent is outrageous!
[2022-12-10 03:54:42] <%ViteRamen> my fav is the egg man who offers you a drink when you are sad
[2022-12-10 03:54:49] <%$jbrew123> Are yokai basically treated like Fae when it comes to logic/reasoning with them?
[2022-12-10 03:54:51] <@%$zMiyuZ> talking does not solve anything
[2022-12-10 03:54:51] <%+bluedude153> If I remeber right the digimon fights you get via pictures in this chapter has some fun guys

[2022-12-10 03:55:32] <bigsadge> yokai is like a supernatural creature
[2022-12-10 03:55:37] <%ProvokedTree> If there is some form of natural phenomena that someone needed to explain at some point in time there is probably a yokai that causes it

[2022-12-10 03:57:01] <%Lavaros> nah I get it I had to use it as well because it was all over the place and is specific to each digimon even by stage not just line I pulled my hair out before I found a guide

[2022-12-10 04:36:04] <Ceerion_> so angemon is the only one that can evolve in ophanimon? or he cant either?

[2022-12-10 05:50:02] <skeletal_jelly> I like Agumon's doofy voice
[2022-12-10 05:50:02] <%+Kenlesu> they just need to use friendship punch and it will solve everything
[2022-12-10 05:50:04] <+JadePharaoh> But at the same time they're afraid that their Digimon will turn on them the same way Lopmon did on Shuuji...
[2022-12-10 05:50:19] <MoggiiJunkit> digimon isn't as wholesome as we remember LOL
[2022-12-10 05:50:20] <Ser_Lagsalot> I remember Digimon being really dark compared to the other shows on at the time
[2022-12-10 05:50:24] <@%$JustSainThings> I said Leomon doesnt count
[2022-12-10 05:50:26] <Jaysky> Those were just kid friendly deaths!
[2022-12-10 05:50:26] <sp145h> HUH

[2022-12-10 05:50:46] <%Amazinger> Leomon girldmLUL
[2022-12-10 05:50:50] <skeletal_jelly> I remember my mom walking in on the scene where ladydevimon was tickling the tied up kids, and I wanted to die

[2022-12-10 05:50:54] <+PopsicleMoon> Digimon was always trauma pokemon. It was the added spice!

[2022-12-10 05:51:00] <%mitnakaesh> I've never seen any digimon shows so I remember none of this :)

[2022-12-10 05:51:09] <%Lavaros> Or that time that Myotismon straight up killed a human woman
[2022-12-10 05:51:09] <%Tinchade> Digimon fun and wholesome
[2022-12-10 05:51:09] <$kenku_kenny> Pokemon with issues
[2022-12-10 05:51:15] <+g3t_racket> We had dubbed scraps... that's why we didnd't think it was that dark as kids...
[2022-12-10 05:51:15] <misermark> Or when Piedmon was torturing Wargreymon while the rest of the team was regrouping?
[2022-12-10 05:51:22] <Jaysky> Listen it's fine those were child friendly deaths, these are adult deaths. girldmWhyF

[2022-12-10 05:51:45] <%+SkyHawk0> Ghost Game has a crazy body count
[2022-12-10 05:51:46] <%Lavaros> The dub is still dark it just used creative language to get around the word kill
[2022-12-10 05:51:55] <@%$JustSainThings> we all watched digimon when we had small kid brains so we mostly didnt understand what was going on
[2022-12-10 05:51:55] <Ser_Lagsalot> At least the plague of 4Kids is gone now.
[2022-12-10 05:52:06] <%Tinchade> Less Myotismon picking up women in his carriage though
[2022-12-10 05:52:08] <%GreggoWaffles15> Izzy having an existential crisis in the void girldmPanicF
[2022-12-10 05:52:09] <atigerwithlaserbeams> Wizards only have like 4hp, he was doomed from the start Kappa

[2022-12-10 05:52:14] <+darkmagics0601> How about that time all the Numemon sacrificed themselves to save Kari from Machinedramon
[2022-12-10 05:52:14] <%Lavaros> until tamers where they couldn't anymore and they just went with it
[2022-12-10 05:52:17] <$evildrcatfish> I remember how broken the 4kids dub was on some episodes. took the gun from TK in that one puppetmon episode
[2022-12-10 05:52:17] <%+bluedude153> You were a kid and missed like every third episode so you ended up confused about the trauma
[2022-12-10 05:52:17] <%PirateArtisans> pondering the Orbmon
[2022-12-10 05:52:21] <%mitnakaesh> hey dm, since you and this game have made me interested in digimon, is there a show you'd recommend to check out first?
[2022-12-10 05:52:23] <%$Bazeio> monkaW 1700 dmg
[2022-12-10 05:52:23] <misermark> Ohhhh! Speaking of Wizardmon, is Wizardmon in this game? That is my favorite digimon, especially after his iconic self-sacrifice.

[2022-12-10 05:52:41] <%+NiamhKami> Never really had a chance to watch the anime back in the 90s since where I grew up we didn't have TV (well that channel)
[2022-12-10 05:52:52] <%barrettsmithbb> LUL
[2022-12-10 05:52:52] <%DedlokPM> Digimon was not 4Kids. It was studioplis.
[2022-12-10 05:52:57] <Ser_Lagsalot> Which is the worst digimon show? And which is the darkest?
[2022-12-10 05:52:58] <%BloodAsp20XX> girldmDizzy girldmDizzy girldmDizzy
[2022-12-10 05:52:58] <ApatheticProcrastinator> I think Tamers is usually the most highly recommended
[2022-12-10 05:53:03] <%Sun_Rendered> girldmLUL
[2022-12-10 05:53:03] <%+Kenlesu> i like 2 and 3 the most
[2022-12-10 05:53:03] <noctis_3d> Or that horrible Digimon Angela Anaconda intro that caused many people to walk out on the movie.
[2022-12-10 05:53:08] <%Miano_SEA> yeah, tamers is a gateway to digimon games...and the safest one
[2022-12-10 05:53:08] <%+theyepetos> but frontier has the best opening
[2022-12-10 05:53:11] <%Tinchade> Was Frontier your first digimon DM?
[2022-12-10 05:53:12] <%barrettsmithbb> That really hurt to say, eh? LUL
[2022-12-10 05:53:12] <@%$JustSainThings> Frontier is ok... just not the best
[2022-12-10 05:53:15] <Mr_Metus> no wait, the female girl got into depression when her digimon died in front of her (not dying)
[2022-12-10 05:53:15] <%mitnakaesh> girldmNoted tamers and frontier
[2022-12-10 05:53:17] <Jaysky> Frontier had cool designs, I also loved the english opening for it
[2022-12-10 05:53:18] <%+NiamhKami> But did Digimon have jelly filled donuts?
[2022-12-10 05:53:19] <%+Kenlesu> i don't frontier as much
[2022-12-10 05:53:20] <+JadePharaoh> The Saban dub sanitized a lot of it, but yeah, the Digimon anime had plenty of dark and creepy moments.
[2022-12-10 05:53:21] <+Lucaan> I remember not really liking Frontier as a kid. Loved Tamers, though.
[2022-12-10 05:53:23] <%Miano_SEA> If you're new to Digimon, listen to DM. Go play Tamers

[2022-12-10 05:53:39] <Ser_Lagsalot> Anybody else remember that Digimon movie which was baically just Discount Summer Wars?
[2022-12-10 05:53:40] <%+SkyHawk0> Frontiers is also the most different so starting with it may give a weird impression

[2022-12-10 05:53:43] <misermark> I personally liked Digimon Savers. Just the idea of a guy punching a digimon was funny concept to me.

[2022-12-10 05:53:52] <ApatheticProcrastinator> Frontier is BETTER than I thought as a kid, but I wouldn't say the best.
[2022-12-10 05:53:54] <%Miano_SEA> Agreed
[2022-12-10 05:53:55] <%Lavaros> Even Xros wars which I'd argue is the most light hearted one had its main character never refuse to help some one because he didn't help a friend once and they died in a car accident.
[2022-12-10 05:53:55] <%+GhostV2> I literally know nothing about digimon other than "CHAAAANGE into DIGITAL CHAMPIONS tooooo save the Digital **WORLD**"

[2022-12-10 05:58:03] <+Lucaan> Also, 01 and 02 was a TV show in Tamers iirc
[2022-12-10 05:58:05] <$evildrcatfish> in the games there's also that purple haired lady that does toos

[2022-12-10 22:09:22] <otakon17> Dragonball was very comedy based
[2022-12-10 22:09:22] <Harbingerofpickles> @Countryboy00 surely you mean "Dr. Ned"
[2022-12-10 22:09:38] <%MyDiceRollOnes> Dragonball was an adventure series with combat, Dragonball Z was a combat series with adventure.
[2022-12-10 22:09:45] <%zelul13> I mean, a lot of the 2000's was putting Z and X where they shouldn't be to make it sound edgier, imo
[2022-12-10 22:09:48] <+Countryboy00> @Harbingerofpickles Ah yes my bad
[2022-12-10 22:09:54] <Harbingerofpickles> @Countryboy00 which is clearly not a Z rotated
[2022-12-10 22:09:57] <otakon17> @Streptocarpus you got it, but generally Z is more serious compared to the shenanigans of the first series
[2022-12-10 22:09:59] <+Asheri_Hrafn> Dragon ball was very much a slapsticky comedy manga until the timeskip where it became a lot more about power-ups and screaming
[2022-12-10 22:10:12] <MrSpiteful> it looks like a monster collector similar to pokemon, tem tem, monster sanctuary etc.

[2022-12-10 23:21:23] <%PileofBlep> you see because kiryu doesn't actually kill anyone, he can't actually die when they bring a knife to the fistfight
