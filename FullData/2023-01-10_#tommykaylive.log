[2023-01-10 14:22:21] <%+yepcomeshot> only thing to say about Islam is that he hasn't really fought the top level guys. He's a masheen, but to compare him to other champions that have beat the best of the best in their weight class at this point is a stretch.

It starts you in 1933 as the Weimar, brings you through the historical path (You can deviate a tiny bit, but not politically). So yep! A buildup from 33.

[2023-01-10 17:44:06] <%WaterIsHydrating> @c0sma23 there is a modifier in the civil war that is applied to tiles in Spain, it basically makes the combat much less intense so it lasts longer

[2023-01-10 17:45:58] <KristofTwitch> True!
[2023-01-10 17:45:59] <%+Amatthew123> and you can defend cities better, they are like actual bastions instead of a 1 tile battle
