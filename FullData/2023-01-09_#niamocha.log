[2023-01-09 05:30:19] <%+Elkateth> MJ had tons of popular songs. He was a powerhouse in the 1980s, which is why he was able to buy the entire Beatles song catalog and owned the rights for them for years.

[2023-01-09 06:18:36] <shoeless_hobo> @Elkateth i guess best thing i could ask on that is are you doing something you would enjoy doing or just doing something that you feel you're supposed to? only way to stay on a routine is to do something you enjoy
[2023-01-09 06:19:19] <%+Elkateth> @shoeless_hobo Plus I haven‚Äôt had a workout routine in years. I used to swim professionally and back then I had a Rhythm. Plus it‚Äôs no fun to work out alone
