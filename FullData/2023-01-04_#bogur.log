[2023-01-04 13:30:20] <+lilyie_ow> I liked how ow1 didn't change much, even though double shield was meta I think it didn't define the lower ranks even in diamond and low master
[2023-01-04 13:30:25] <+ChironTheRuby> Overwatch 2 is soooo better, I agree with You maaaaan
[2023-01-04 13:30:33] <%katmosk> @Shinobi612 abusive relationships and overwatch 1 being shit
[2023-01-04 13:30:33] <%alenaistyping> I love ow2 more. I could never go back to double shield

[2023-01-04 15:27:01] <@^Nightbot> Of course bogur has a circular window! You might think it is a bad architectural design a circular window seperating the bedroom from the kitchen but it actually serves a great purpose. It allows the person on the bed to view the people in the kitchen without all the smells and sounds coming through. The circular window motives bogur to get up, be happy, and play winston Monke
