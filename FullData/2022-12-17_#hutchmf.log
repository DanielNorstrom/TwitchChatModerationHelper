[2022-12-17 22:32:25] <%justchillinjay> maybe more ppl playing, they moved servers to "the highest tier available" hour one, maybe that is not good enough either @HutchMF
[2022-12-17 22:32:34] <+HazeyStages> the arrows have random drop compared to the set drop it seems like

[2022-12-17 22:33:35] <%+DeadlyPineapple13> @taraist_ Servers arent split like that Im pretty sure thats total
[2022-12-17 22:33:35] <Ninjad> how is this game going to monetize

[2022-12-17 22:35:09] <+HazeyStages> @Lairend theres a cosmetics shop out now, but you dont buy currency you earn it from escaping/looting/killing stuff
[2022-12-17 22:35:20] <%+DeadlyPineapple13> @Ninjad Devs are primarly looking at single payment, dev team are ex koren MMO devs who hate modern day monetization

[2022-12-17 22:36:14] <%+DeadlyPineapple13> @DeyDae Cleric is a must need in a team of 3, Ranger and rogue are best solo
[2022-12-17 22:36:16] <+HazeyStages> hunter is 1 of the easier ones to learn though
[2022-12-17 22:36:18] <mortythemort> rogue/mage/archer are all i can play cause the movement debuffs with others are sooo high

[2022-12-17 22:54:11] <+smooshpig> once you have decent gear the game is much easier. as far as extracts they def made less of the blues and 2x the reds. purposely so they can test things

[2022-12-17 23:54:01] <%defiantal> Kill him fast and steal his water!
[2022-12-17 23:54:01] <@%RemState> last oasis had that
[2022-12-17 23:54:06] <+Shmief> Harvest your enemies for their water
[2022-12-17 23:54:07] <+Stephen1237890> are there multiple planets?
[2022-12-17 23:54:08] <tomc1k> not new, that's just survival xd
[2022-12-17 23:54:12] <%taraist_> League of Legends?
[2022-12-17 23:54:26] <%$bu11dogjones> it will be like tarkov you find water u will have campers
[2022-12-17 23:54:30] <wilbur377> This game literally seems sooo much like last oasis but more funding cant wait
[2022-12-17 23:54:33] <tomc1k> main question is there other planets
[2022-12-17 23:54:34] <%$b4none> @art_cm you didn't get my point

[2022-12-17 23:54:55] <%stomaha> what's another example of a survival mmo?
[2022-12-17 23:55:01] <tomc1k> can't wait to get aimboted in this game
[2022-12-17 23:55:04] <%defiantal> Depends on how they manage the base combat.
[2022-12-17 23:55:05] <+ZeroTNitrous> this seems sick
[2022-12-17 23:55:10] <+KalumStorey> as long as there's no Chinese zergs I'll be hooked
[2022-12-17 23:55:18] <Alpha_nony> there isn't any good survival mmo tho
[2022-12-17 23:55:21] <Mr_Sk4z> have u played spice wars?
[2022-12-17 23:55:26] <+smooshpig> @stomaha mario
[2022-12-17 23:55:29] <+ZeroTNitrous> rust like raiding or something
[2022-12-17 23:55:29] <bekie1> If they dune leave
[2022-12-17 23:55:30] <%$lPainfull> and arakis is the host of spice
[2022-12-17 23:55:33] <@%RemState> can't wait for the chinese to dupe all the best shit and sell them to the top guilds
[2022-12-17 23:55:37] <+Stephen1237890> still could be a competitor to star citizen maybe?
[2022-12-17 23:55:37] <EpicJune> they should keep it simple with one planet and make it sick
[2022-12-17 23:55:41] <%taraist_> i hope they go to URANUS
[2022-12-17 23:55:43] <+Art_CM> @stomaha i got raped by AI in that game

[2022-12-17 23:55:51] <%Velocilemon> Ark is where it is at for survival
[2022-12-17 23:55:52] <+wulftrn> the vampire one?
[2022-12-17 23:55:55] <+BeOnEDJ> ARK?
[2022-12-17 23:55:56] <%Cutter254> isnt this by the creators of Conan Exiles???? probably going to be very similar i would imagine

[2022-12-17 23:56:08] <%stomaha> @stomaha i did not do that to you
[2022-12-17 23:56:14] <%+HORIZONTALHOURGLASS> the game is literally a desert, with no trees, so in a UE5, they can make the world insanely large, they can create a world not flat earth, and have the scale be large
[2022-12-17 23:56:14] <%+atreyq> The whole point of Arrakis is that it is the only planet with spice
[2022-12-17 23:56:14] <%taraist_> Tarkov
[2022-12-17 23:56:21] <%Velocilemon> Ark to this day is top notch when you learn it
[2022-12-17 23:56:34] <tomc1k> who needs new games, we have tarkov
[2022-12-17 23:56:35] <%stomaha> is EFT really an MMO though?
[2022-12-17 23:56:39] <@%RcAdam> and you can sign up for the beta test rn chat
[2022-12-17 23:56:41] <EpicJune> yea there's still space for a very good survival mmo

[2022-12-17 23:56:51] <@%RemState> too bad the devs have the combined brain power of an arcorn @Velocilemon
[2022-12-17 23:56:51] <+FinalChance21> ark is sooooo good

[2022-12-17 23:56:58] <%$b4none> I think the reason behind it is that there its hard to find a balance between survival and mmorpg , only game that has done it well is albion online

[2022-12-17 23:57:02] <Alpha_nony> I played for like 800hours ark , i hate it as much as i love it
[2022-12-17 23:57:02] <%+AltF4ForNudess> bruh ark is buggy as fuck
[2022-12-17 23:57:03] <%Velocilemon> @RemState truuu

[2022-12-17 23:57:25] <+RemyIV> conan exiles was the same too
[2022-12-17 23:57:25] <+FinalChance21> ark 2 is fixing that. it will be more souls like combat
[2022-12-17 23:57:28] <+RealSideLegs> Soooo Francis on crack Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:57:28] <TnT_Ciggy> bobs
[2022-12-17 23:57:31] <EpicJune> I like modded ark, but the game is very janky imho
[2022-12-17 23:57:36] <%fasterrthanyou> official servers are ass in ark
[2022-12-17 23:57:38] <Jakcld> yo buddy
[2022-12-17 23:57:41] <%+AltF4ForNudess> ark is only fine if you do single player and that is it
[2022-12-17 23:57:41] <Dienastea> LUL ye official is terible 24+ hours to tame a T-rex or spino unofficial made it really fun
[2022-12-17 23:57:42] <tomc1k> it was highly unbalanced and devs were lazy idiots
[2022-12-17 23:57:44] <+hypxrbeam> thats what I do when I play  KEKW
[2022-12-17 23:57:50] <%+atreyq> @taraist_ or another planet for everything nice
[2022-12-17 23:57:53] <%jbakerrr04> are you banned from gta again?
[2022-12-17 23:58:00] <%nomcalm> so much lore in dune they cant really mess it up and to make it a survival mmo fits perfectly
[2022-12-17 23:58:07] <%+mattymicg> im keen for dune 2
[2022-12-17 23:58:10] <+bombrng> do we know how much it will be?
[2022-12-17 23:58:14] <@%RemState> no jbakerrr04 lol
[2022-12-17 23:58:34] <%$b4none> will it be survival or will it be just open world pvp?
[2022-12-17 23:58:37] <+hypxrbeam> unreal engine 5 is too OP
[2022-12-17 23:58:37] <+RemyIV> this looks like its gonna give my pc  a heart attack

[2022-12-17 23:58:47] <%+AltF4ForNudess> @HutchMF are they working off of unreal 5 or their own ip?
[2022-12-17 23:58:56] <Alpha_nony> please tell me you played the mad max game @HutchMF
[2022-12-17 23:58:58] <d4n1kcs> that looks awesome
[2022-12-17 23:58:58] <+badlucksuccubuss> cam off bruh?
[2022-12-17 23:58:59] <tomc1k> I'm just afraid that you gonna need a really good pc to play this game at 60 fps+
[2022-12-17 23:59:09] <grim62> Is ramee going to play?
[2022-12-17 23:59:09] <%stomaha> hair is crazy
[2022-12-17 23:59:11] <@%RcAdam> @RemState thats awesome
[2022-12-17 23:59:14] <EpicJune> this gonna be on Unreal 5?
[2022-12-17 23:59:20] <DarkSectorLive> @HutchMF this is just cinematic tho
[2022-12-17 23:59:20] <%Emywox> graphics mean nothing in a trailer
[2022-12-17 23:59:24] <@%RemState> yeah it's on unreal 5.1 atm
[2022-12-17 23:59:28] <benjiisin> Did you like the movie??
[2022-12-17 23:59:28] <+smooshpig> he wins ez
[2022-12-17 23:59:28] <+pb_ok> The last Dune movie was so good that I read the book so I knew what happened lol
[2022-12-17 23:59:29] <D4VY_W4VY> that's a cinematica, no way that's rendered in game
[2022-12-17 23:59:31] <+Art_CM> this isnt in engine graphics btw
[2022-12-17 23:59:33] <+RemyIV> definitely gonna have my pc in a chokehold fs tryna run this
[2022-12-17 23:59:35] <tomc1k> no Nvidia hair fix
[2022-12-17 23:59:35] <D4VY_W4VY> cinematic*

[2022-12-17 23:59:43] <%taraist_> that was my dad
[2022-12-17 23:59:43] <Alpha_nony> nah fck trailer , it mean nothing nowadays
[2022-12-17 23:59:44] <+hypxrbeam> @tomc1k Unreal engine 5 is really well optimized so super intense graphics doesnt mean u need super computer
[2022-12-17 23:59:48] <%+wyatt89> the last scene in Dune where that woman is riding the worm is sick
[2022-12-17 23:59:51] <Iittle_wenir_boy> thats not in game lol
[2022-12-17 23:59:52] <@%RemState> that is unreal 5 it's not a render
[2022-12-17 23:59:55] <+KalumStorey> It says the player built outposts are temporary so I'm guessing the sand worms will always come for them
[2022-12-17 23:59:58] <nuke_fla120> cinematics always look good LUL
[2022-12-17 23:59:58] <EpicJune> @RemState noice
