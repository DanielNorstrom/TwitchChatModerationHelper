[2022-12-22 02:29:25] <%MoorieceSalty> One of my art teachers said I had an anime style and I gave up on art
[2022-12-22 02:29:26] <!%TheSBR> Anime is that feeling you get when your foot falls asleep
[2022-12-22 02:29:29] <Ghin_Aoiichi> @LFVelasco X for Doubt

[2022-12-22 02:31:56] <!%+maximum_meatball> I did a painting of Peter Griffin in my Senior year and my art teacher hated it while everyone else loved it
