[2023-01-08 00:53:34] <saitax_07> The edge is iron, the spine is steel for katanas.

[2023-01-08 20:02:38] <@%Mikulex> i just farted
[2023-01-08 20:08:18] <Kagumiiin> chills
[2023-01-08 20:25:07] <@%Mikulex> yo kagu, im now at around the same progress on eu like na lmao
[2023-01-08 20:26:10] <@%Mikulex> @Kagumiiin, am i understanding correctly that hu tao is gonna be in the next banner
[2023-01-08 20:28:24] <Kagumiiin> next banner is xiao + alhaitham
[2023-01-08 20:28:26] <Kagumiiin> after that hutao + yelan
[2023-01-08 20:29:17] <Kagumiiin> after that likely dehya
[2023-01-08 20:29:41] <Kagumiiin> shenhe and eula and ayaka are the most likely to comeback after that
[2023-01-08 20:30:41] <hawichii> cyro patch with dehya
[2023-01-08 20:30:43] <@%Mikulex> ok, then i just misunderstood something
[2023-01-08 20:31:16] <Kagumiiin> she's in the next update but not next banner
[2023-01-08 20:31:26] <@%Mikulex> cause i got a newsletter about 3.4 and saw hu tao in it
[2023-01-08 20:31:37] <@%Mikulex> so a patch usually has like 2 banners
[2023-01-08 20:31:43] <hawichii> 2 phase
[2023-01-08 20:31:49] <@%Mikulex> i c
[2023-01-08 20:31:51] <hawichii> each phase can have up to 2 banners
[2023-01-08 20:32:02] <hawichii> 2 char banner
[2023-01-08 20:33:15] <@%Mikulex> i still dont really have a genshin waifu
[2023-01-08 20:33:43] <Kagumiiin> watch yelan's trailer
[2023-01-08 20:33:52] <Kagumiiin> have a bag of tissue ready

[2023-01-08 20:34:47] <hawichii> pull raiden rn ig
[2023-01-08 20:35:24] <@%Mikulex> shenhe looks intriguing
[2023-01-08 20:35:51] <@%Mikulex> im pulling on the raiden banner, but all i got until now is rosaria c2
[2023-01-08 20:36:08] <hawichii> you can go for her but prob not the greatest idea bc she only buff cryo dmg and nothing else
[2023-01-08 20:37:11] <@%Mikulex> guess we'll see
[2023-01-08 20:37:21] <Kagumiiin> for overworld content anyone works so she's not unworth
[2023-01-08 20:37:28] <Kagumiiin> unworthy
[2023-01-08 20:40:39] <@TheHoneyedOwl> im kinda felling for GI but also not
[2023-01-08 21:39:22] <@%Mikulex> youre right about overworld but some chars are just fun to play
[2023-01-08 21:39:43] <@%Mikulex> or in other games i sometimes have a character i just instantly like designwise
