[2023-01-01 14:07:53] <@%^Nightbot> @JohnnyStrelok  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 14:18:51] <@%^Nightbot> @HammerMan_99  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 14:37:03] <@%^Nightbot> @OblivionGming  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 16:15:58] <+TerranceSkill> on another stream the streamer said he got word from nikita that they did not change a thing on scavs. i cant believe =D
[2023-01-01 16:16:03] <avalansche_> !fps
[2023-01-01 16:16:03] <@%^Nightbot> Enabling FPS Counter: while in raid, gently press on the '~' key, then type "fps 1" without quotes, and hit enter.
[2023-01-01 16:16:06] <+KofeB> done do gunsmit 11 until they fix it my game is fucking broke i cant buy sell anything man
[2023-01-01 16:16:07] <TheBlackGlacier> Muting the stream, discounts/removes you as a viewer/lurker. But, muting the tab avoids that. Twitch and their making sure viewers ain't cheating.

[2023-01-01 16:35:04] <lee_erratic> im scared of scavs now more than players its CRAZY
[2023-01-01 16:35:09] <%$Drison101> @Axel_tv basic scavs are now more accurate and more of a threat than real PMCs
[2023-01-01 16:35:12] <The_Silverbacks_Loose> i dont mind the scav buff but it's when they shoot through multiple bushes that get me
[2023-01-01 16:35:14] <+Murcovsky> no way they didnt got 1 tapped by scavs multiple times already
[2023-01-01 16:35:22] <+pepe_legal> the scavs are leveling up each wipe haahah soon everyone will b killa
[2023-01-01 16:35:29] <lee_erratic> @The_Silverbacks_Loose and walls bro they shoot thro walls  now!
[2023-01-01 16:35:33] <TALEEE> i was feeling i was getting killed by them more as well
[2023-01-01 16:35:37] <DrBerny47> question for you guys did the raider or agro on scav all the time ?
[2023-01-01 16:35:41] <%byThePaul> killa trained them
[2023-01-01 16:35:42] <ehjayconcuba> i dont like it when the scavs laff after killing me with 7mm buckshot
[2023-01-01 16:35:53] <The_Silverbacks_Loose> @ehjayconcuba haha ikr
[2023-01-01 16:35:57] <%iTz_Nick013> Nikita is watching Streams with popcorn and laught when they die due op scavs
[2023-01-01 16:35:57] <+FondaYou> They probably didnt buff scavs but they did mess with some code that indirectly affects the scavs. Happens a lot in software engineering. Fix one thing to break another.

[2023-01-01 16:56:14] <+protissog> It's possible that they actually didn't change anything, but perhaps netcode improvements mean that they need to decrease their abilities because they're doing things more efficiently than they used to.

[2023-01-01 17:36:52] <+Derpitor> So I've foundthat if your scav standing is high your scav queue is fucked.  I have to invite a random person to my group and start it with them to get into matches quickly

[2023-01-01 17:37:43] <Verdano> Derpitor add more servers
[2023-01-01 17:37:46] <+Derpitor> The group queue then is definitely quicker.. 4min avg vs 10+ mins

[2023-01-01 17:38:18] <+Celestial51500> so i should not do auto select, and just manually select a bunch of servers for faster times?
[2023-01-01 17:38:22] <Cuailo> @Derpitor because they will be on different servers
[2023-01-01 17:38:34] <PutinIsSmallAndBald> Can you cross bridge towards lightkeeper or no?

[2023-01-01 18:17:53] <@%^Nightbot> @oktan2345  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 18:49:47] <swift3rz> @Toxicben_ttv dont forget to restart your game every once in a while to avoid memory leaks
[2023-01-01 18:49:54] <banerou> @MrSchmo_ There is but not huge. You can say if they detect an enemy, if frag is out or when a scav dies

If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 21:49:30] <@%^Nightbot> @dwarf_wolf  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-01 23:01:42] <+FellKin> @yaididit skier is best in my opinion, biggest reward. however just be aware you will lose big rep with the other two. so if money isnt really an issue for you, turn it in to the person with the lowest rep/who you value higher trader level the most.
[2023-01-01 23:01:42] <@%mfrayd> @Axel_tv nope

[2023-01-01 23:02:40] <NordicBattalion> If twitch unban them, it will be open season on all live streams for that content. The legal liability against twitch would be insane
[2023-01-01 23:02:48] <%+certifiedfrogboy> i think it during the drops / promo event they can get out of the ban easier. because there is paperwork between twitch and BSG
