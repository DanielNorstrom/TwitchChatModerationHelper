[2023-01-01 11:48:50] <ozzzzeey> cuz u were drunk and wrote an email to tthe boss and now u are sorry :D
[2023-01-01 11:48:52] <+ComfyDegen> i'd prolly sooner die than go back to a job i quit lmao
[2023-01-01 11:48:56] <Distxnct_> i left the company i was working for because i went to school Shruge
[2023-01-01 11:49:32] <+xKr0w> i left my corpa job too and start my small business
[2023-01-01 11:49:36] <gionnisins> u can easyly finda another Corpa job if u are competent and know what u do

[2023-01-01 11:55:03] <Distxnct_> like in terms of mmos i feel FFXIV has one of the best balancing
[2023-01-01 11:55:07] <Anatrus> even then they would say its unbalanced lmao
[2023-01-01 11:55:15] <Distxnct_> every class is pretty well balanced
[2023-01-01 11:55:21] <Distxnct_> besides maybe machinist in ff

[2023-01-01 13:27:40] <+phreakinblade> i doubt that in the west the game is gonna get many new players because its so hard to get to the endgame just to get gatekept there
[2023-01-01 13:28:34] <%OniiFans> I've cleared g6 9 times so far. Surely I don't get gatekept in 1-2 with my downbad alts
[2023-01-01 13:28:58] <+Excoupe7> @xPaxton how are you dealing with being so behind? if I didn't have friends 1500+, I'd quit completely
[2023-01-01 13:29:09] <%+Cylozs> dps alts are kinda timewaste anyway cause you cant find supports for hours

[2023-01-01 21:14:30] <+CrispyFishTacos> @atk how do you tell when to go x3 or +1 on hard g5?
[2023-01-01 21:14:54] <Rathim_> @AFK_Crying That doesn't stop bots at all
[2023-01-01 21:14:58] <happy_but_sad> first shape is x3 second is +1
[2023-01-01 21:15:02] <vegetasaiyanking> Whenever I tune in, ATK always has killer beats lol
[2023-01-01 21:15:04] <happy_but_sad> and reason is bec of her attack patterns
[2023-01-01 21:15:10] <+TheAssIsStillFat> @AFK_Crying Subs w/o pheons, I would've played this
[2023-01-01 21:15:13] <happy_but_sad> if u go first shape x3+1 u will get hit while trying to land shape
[2023-01-01 21:15:33] <+CrispyFishTacos> @happy_but_sad That is normal. I asked for hard

[2023-01-01 21:16:07] <+AFK_Crying> @AFK_Crying wouldn't completely destroy ALL bots, but it would definitely help the situation if every bot costs like $15/mo to run and with the possibilty to ban
[2023-01-01 21:16:38] <Rathim_> The card enhancement is so fast in KR
[2023-01-01 21:17:15] <+Slemlul> would make them less numerous but $15 wont stop them entirely (e.g. WoW)
