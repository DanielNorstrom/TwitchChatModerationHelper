[2023-01-04 00:00:24] <@%pilllowofbees> KEKL ye if youre cryo, rip anyone building geo
[2023-01-04 00:00:28] <@^StreamElements> Come check out my new YT video at https://www.youtube.com/c/MaiRubeeVT
[2023-01-04 00:00:41] <!%Runato> Unless your Geo is Zhongli lmao
[2023-01-04 00:01:06] <@%pilllowofbees> rubeePepega crit zhong for big meat balls
[2023-01-04 00:01:30] <!%Runato> bless MHY for making ER/HP scaling characters like Yelan, they do so much dmg and are tanky/fast rechargers

[2023-01-04 00:02:18] <@%pilllowofbees> agreeGe id agree if i actually had her
[2023-01-04 00:02:27] <!%Runato> ...hm. I get the feeling I might wanna spend my gold dust on non gloves/boots now, a ton of my pieces are off-ele for my Volt team
[2023-01-04 00:03:01] <!%master_quadrillion> zhongli's really f2p friendly to build just need hp and black tassel
[2023-01-04 00:03:30] <@%pilllowofbees> ye just having him makes the game so much more playable too
[2023-01-04 00:03:45] <!%Runato> Engine is Frost, Legs are Volt/Flame, Belt is Frost but mostly HP, Bracers are Volt, Armor is Flame/Phys, Spaulders is Frost, Helm is Flame..

[2023-01-04 00:08:17] <!%Runato> I feel like spending gold dust on non gloves/boots would be good with my equipment dilemma rn
[2023-01-04 00:08:19] <!%master_quadrillion> ye fr u can do a crit build with zhongli but u need a 5 star weapon like homa or pwjs to make it work, not f2p friendly KEKL
[2023-01-04 00:09:17] <@%pilllowofbees> gold dust is honestly not hard to get now, i always use it on non gloves and boots
[2023-01-04 00:09:40] <!%Runato> What're the sources for it other than Phantasm again? I need to do my Raids for some of those too..

[2023-01-04 00:11:28] <!%Runato> ...I just realized, my Island stuff is at all lvl 8's atm lol, so behind..
[2023-01-04 00:11:51] <@%pilllowofbees> nah thats good im only getting everything to 9 now there

[2023-01-04 00:12:17] <!%Runato> Is this Pokemon event just afk and watch them fight or so if you're F2P?
[2023-01-04 00:12:29] <!%Runato> Cause otherwise I'd have to rely on the parade, which is just awful for gains
[2023-01-04 00:12:34] <@%pilllowofbees> best thing about island build is the red matrix every month
[2023-01-04 00:12:58] <@^StreamElements> Come hang out with me on my other platforms! I'd really appreciate it rubeeH : https://mairubee.carrd.co/
[2023-01-04 00:13:15] <@%pilllowofbees> parade is easier than whale battling lol id rather do that
[2023-01-04 00:13:41] <!%Runato> Yes but it's also super limited time-wise isn't it? Specific time frames and I only have 1K gained total...and I have like 7 days to max out
[2023-01-04 00:14:04] VIEWERS: 191
[2023-01-04 00:14:06] <@%pilllowofbees> there is still one more part to that event to come so well see how effective that is
[2023-01-04 00:14:24] <!%Runato> So I guess I have to queue up the Pokemon event and just afk or something...afaik Reddit says it's hella awful but that's reddit lmao
[2023-01-04 00:14:29] <@%pilllowofbees> 1k a day is the daily increase/limit so its good
[2023-01-04 00:14:38] <%josh_ninjaomify> ga pillow

[2023-01-04 00:15:10] <@%pilllowofbees> i mean it was god awful at the start bc if you lost you  got basically nothing

[2023-01-04 00:16:35] <!%Runato> Damn, I feel like I need to switch A0 Lin out for either A6 Huma, A1 Shiro, A3 King, A2 Meryl or so, she's just not shattering enough for my volt comp of Samir/Neme
[2023-01-04 00:17:27] <@%pilllowofbees> shes not the best shatter option tbh shes just a universal buffer
[2023-01-04 00:17:45] <!%Runato> Yeah, which is very iffy especially for this comp
[2023-01-04 00:17:58] <!%Runato> I love her utility similar to Scara for flying
[2023-01-04 00:18:06] VIEWERS: 206
[2023-01-04 00:18:12] <!%Runato> But she's faltering when it matters most atm
[2023-01-04 00:18:37] <@%pilllowofbees> i mean shes a god send for any f2p bc she makes any base ssr effective
[2023-01-04 00:19:27] <!%Runato> I'll have to send my Asc deets over for the sake of letting ya know what's going on but I really am reconsidering going Volt from the person who advised me to do so
[2023-01-04 00:19:58] <@%pilllowofbees> volt is like the most free damage type in the game
[2023-01-04 00:20:01] <!%Runato> Sure my Samir's A5 and Neme is A2 but vs A5 Zero and A6 Huma, I'm very uncertain esp since I have A0 Ruby

[2023-01-04 00:25:39] <@%pilllowofbees> samir/nem/lin is like go too easy volt team, ruby/huma/lin would be good flame, if you had meryl at a5 or tsubasa at a3 you could put them with frigg/lin
[2023-01-04 00:26:10] VIEWERS: 196
[2023-01-04 00:26:56] <!%Runato> What about in terms of Shatter? That's my biggest problem with Samir/Nem/Lin atm. Ruby/Huma/Lin would be a good idea I agree, only concern would be healing... I'm at 81 wep currency atm so not too much later and I could A3 Tsubasa soon
[2023-01-04 00:27:49] <JayGon_Toozee> Any chance of pulling a single copy of Tian?
[2023-01-04 00:28:06] <@%pilllowofbees> you gotta think about what role you wanna play and go from there, humma spinns have crazy shatter on them but if you really need more swap lin for king

[2023-01-04 00:30:59] <!%master_quadrillion> ok
[2023-01-04 00:31:02] <%Jeddek_> For my DPS build I have Lin/Tsubasa/Saki, Tank I have Meryl/Frigg(or venus if I require extra healing)/Saki
[2023-01-04 00:31:41] <@%pilllowofbees> ye i think thats like the general meta ice comps rn
[2023-01-04 00:32:06] <%Jeddek_> Can apparently do Lin/Frigg/Saki as well? But I only have A4 Frigg, but A6 tsubasa
[2023-01-04 00:32:09] VIEWERS: 191
[2023-01-04 00:32:27] <@%pilllowofbees> om only a4 he says
[2023-01-04 00:32:27] <%Jeddek_> So until Frigg's rerun, I'll be doing Tsubasa

[2023-01-04 00:32:33] <%Jeddek_> om
[2023-01-04 00:32:41] <%Jeddek_> I got insanely lucky with Frigg
[2023-01-04 00:32:59] <%Jeddek_> a4 in the first 120 pulls
[2023-01-04 00:33:14] <@%pilllowofbees> thats busted

[2023-01-04 00:34:47] <%Jeddek_> Only 1 or the other
[2023-01-04 00:34:51] <%Jeddek_> never both
[2023-01-04 00:35:22] <@%pilllowofbees> a6 tsubasa is honestly really good, depending on how good your saki or lin is id consider swappig and testing
[2023-01-04 00:36:09] VIEWERS: 185
[2023-01-04 00:36:13] <%Jeddek_> The short CD on her skill makes me think so, but the passive damage from 4 set Frigg is nothing to sneeze at

[2023-01-04 00:36:39] <%Jeddek_> I also didn't know there were those target dummies in Mirroria so I'll do some testing
[2023-01-04 00:37:22] <@%pilllowofbees> i mean her skill isnt even the best part of her, a6 gets you a 25% boost for landing a few dash/aim shots
[2023-01-04 00:38:01] <%Jeddek_> Oh for sure
