[2023-01-04 17:28:21] <%$emka395> @skill4ltu  i get what you mean, but to compare it with other marathons isn't kinda fare cus it's not jus pixel that wg created, it's about licensing from James Cameron and Warner Bros. and plus the tank is pos actually just as collectible. so yeah only problem is that they even made it marathon form
[2023-01-04 17:28:23] <%$MballsEzHary> Is this the duck-killzor tank?

[2023-01-04 17:28:49] <%+TheUberRam> @crimsonthebesmircher lottery, like 4 premiums available. for me it took the guaranteed drop, then next drop had the premium light. 56 boxes total
[2023-01-04 17:28:54] <%EpherealX> @skill4ltu I think the way they could balance the BZ is to make the fire chance much higher because of the rockets on it and also 100% chance of fire if you hit the rockets
[2023-01-04 17:29:05] <%+NoLuckPureRNG> it would be cheap but tank looks to be at most average

[2023-01-04 17:29:07] <%+Szulson> @skill4ltu Now we should expected other Marathon for only 80% off price...
[2023-01-04 17:29:11] <+XtremeXwing> @skill4ltu I think war gaming are dangling a carrot to the f2p players to spend a little bit of money on the game and try and get them hooked
[2023-01-04 17:29:12] <+k3ve__> @Fherot And your time to grind it. Remember. Before this, it was just your time. Now it is time+15dollars.

[2023-01-04 17:29:14] <%+T3ddyRuxp1n> @skill4ltu  wooden dildo might be worth more to some people ;)
[2023-01-04 17:29:19] <alexei1242> wooden dildo is more worth than bread Kappa Kappa @skill4ltu
[2023-01-04 17:29:22] <+granaxxx> @EpherealX they must nerf the accuracy and the armor

[2023-01-04 17:29:29] <swiftwolf10> @EpherealX I think like an ammo rack explosion chance to be higher
[2023-01-04 17:29:29] <%google_kereso> @skill4ltu buddy, today magic happened... I started with 2 win out of 6 games, at 15 games I have 10 wins... wtf happened?

[2023-01-04 17:29:37] <%The_GhostOwl> @skill4ltu not just 3,500g it is also 40 hours or so of grinding in 2 weeks
[2023-01-04 17:29:38] <styopata> @alexei1242 good one :D
[2023-01-04 17:29:38] <%+Fherot> @skill4ltu What about 90% of people who don‚Äôt have the crazy time to finish a marathon 100% free and had to open wallets for tanks but now I only need to spend tiny bit of gold

[2023-01-04 17:30:06] <crimsonthebesmircher> @TheUberRam ok
[2023-01-04 17:30:09] <%hootowot> I don't think the value is the problem. Some people never want to spend money on this game and they should still have access to the tanks released in marathons in my opinion.
[2023-01-04 17:30:09] <%google_kereso> @momix99 buy cucumber, that's cheaper, no?
[2023-01-04 17:30:14] <%+Nasdasdy> pisses me off: they didn't use Arnold Terminator Voice!

[2023-01-04 17:30:21] <@%Basleader92> Previous years we had even calendar where people could buy stuff with gold, this year it wasn't there so WG needs a new way to sink the gold (even though gold value isn't what it used to be)

[2023-01-04 17:30:50] <+Zhamnov> I mean, its not like the premium is that good, its not a new shitpack or borrat... we can just skip it like most everyone skipped the T42
[2023-01-04 17:30:54] <%stonk2811> Can someone explain me what's the problem ? no tank for marathon or smth ?
[2023-01-04 17:30:58] <gasperzupancic> @skill4ltu to late

[2023-01-04 17:31:05] <%$emka395> @skill4ltu they should just realised it as 150‚Ç¨ bundle without all marathon shit
[2023-01-04 17:31:06] <@%Basleader92> @Slistex not defending them, just pointing out that it's not as black or white as some people say ;)
[2023-01-04 17:31:07] <%google_kereso> @momix99 until you toss it into the fire accidentaly
[2023-01-04 17:31:07] <$TesserTheLost> Thats mostly how battle passes work though, ANY other game you play thats how they work THOUGH, I would like to get enough gold from one battle pass to pay for the next one, which is how most of them work
[2023-01-04 17:31:11] <@%momix99> @google_kereso but finding the proper size ... also it might not be great after a few uses :\

[2023-01-04 17:31:33] <itz_adamek_31> E100 or AMX 50 B ? I need this
[2023-01-04 17:31:36] <%chirop_> some people just won't get what your saying they can't think further ahead they are chasing FTP away and this will hurt the game in the long run
[2023-01-04 17:31:43] <+nicudinu05> HeyGuys
[2023-01-04 17:31:51] <%+Fherot> Will people stop crying if the next normal marathon is the same as before?
[2023-01-04 17:31:54] <$TesserTheLost> @chirop_ Thats why fortnight is failing so hard
[2023-01-04 17:31:55] <+Kraemer311> I would much rather pay for a sub in this game then all these fkn micro transactions
[2023-01-04 17:31:56] <%PrinsOf> 3500 gold is not much? It is like paying 30% of the tanks value after grinding it fully. No way am I going to do it
[2023-01-04 17:31:59] <%+machin8> @skill4ltu I just think they are testing it out, thyts why they gave us a mediocre tank as reward.
[2023-01-04 17:32:08] <$TesserTheLost> @chirop_ thats why apex legends s failing so hard
[2023-01-04 17:32:12] <@%momix99> @Fherot obviously no LUL people will always cry
[2023-01-04 17:32:15] <+wrenoc> maybe they figured F2P players can already get the T32 for credits anyways
[2023-01-04 17:32:18] <fromkaku> @skill4ltu what would be a tank I should save my gold for?

[2023-01-04 17:32:38] <@%Basleader92> @itz_adamek_31 can't compare those, completely different playstyle, 50B is good but really hard to play for most people, E100 is also good but kinda slow so in big open maps you will struggle, but I still suggest the E100 over 50B because it's a LOT easier to play
[2023-01-04 17:32:39] <vladtmhb> yeah and p2w players will also get experimental equipment because why not
[2023-01-04 17:32:43] <%+Fherot> @momix99 and if they got tank for free they‚Äôd cry that it sucks too skilStopcry never happy!

[2023-01-04 17:33:16] <%average_maus_enjoyer> @skill4ltu is there a premium tank for gold in the game available that‚Äôs worth it or u would wait for special offers?
[2023-01-04 17:33:19] <$TesserTheLost> @chirop_ im being sarcastic, those games are HUGE and keep growing and they have this style of model
[2023-01-04 17:33:24] <%$emka395> @skill4ltu they should just realised it as 150‚Ç¨ bundle without all marathon shit. and you just changed my mind, maybe from yt I didn't fully understood your point

[2023-01-04 17:33:40] <Slistex> @Basleader92 yes, they didnt made event calendar and need to sink gold. So they are lazy and greedy. Not white and black ;) @Basleader92
[2023-01-04 17:33:44] <%NunexTK> @skill4ltu problem is most people will buy the pass just because they have a lot of gold from boxes

[2023-01-04 17:37:16] <Cadifor_> @skill4ltu Hi King Babboon is it worth spent bonds for tier9 kapz i have allready concept 1b which is awesome
[2023-01-04 17:37:20] <+wrenoc> @wrenoc if you have a BZ already you have the most OP tank for a while anyways, so dont worry about it
[2023-01-04 17:37:22] <%NunexTK> why didnt u leave old videos up?
[2023-01-04 17:37:23] <@%Basleader92> @paingod_73 that was always the case, but in the same time the amount of prem days you can get from events, x4 XP weekends etc etc etc made it MUCH easier to f2p, and don't forget the blueprints either. Compared to 6 7 years ago it's much better for f2p honestly
[2023-01-04 17:37:40] <%NunexTK> i watched quite a few
[2023-01-04 17:37:41] <!%Paid__Actor> @skill4ltu I watch the stream in 0p anyways DarkMode

[2023-01-04 17:37:42] <swiftwolf10> @whizbangfrenzy1 Yeah i haven't been happy with the direction of the game in the last several years so ive made sure to stop spending on it.
[2023-01-04 17:37:43] <%PrinsOf> The reason for all these premium currencies is because once someone purchases them, they loose the sense of the value and are more eager to spend it

[2023-01-04 17:55:54] <%arcantoar> because of the economy, premium account is the most worth it, because it saving time, maybe Prem a tank or teo

[2023-01-04 18:01:46] <knezboss> @skill4ltu what is better to pick on t54 ltwt boosting camo or boost view range as 7 field mode?

[2023-01-04 18:02:04] <@%Basleader92> @arcantoar honestly, don't worry about WN8 to much, just try to learn from mistakes you make and set a goal for yourself, something like "do my HP in damage EVERY game" if you can do that 9/10 times then make it harder, that's a good way to improve

[2023-01-04 18:21:59] <%+WarHawk_47> @ibontech Hi there
[2023-01-04 18:22:01] <LunarSkitter> @skill4ltu has there been some changes to  Progetto tier X medium, since its release? I distinctly recall it being your favorite tier X after it was introduced, but now I've seen your fav tier X mediums video and I was surprised not to see it there.
[2023-01-04 18:22:06] <%EasyEight7> chat: what is your opinion on Panther II? skip or grind through?
[2023-01-04 18:22:13] <1xSpectraL> @skill4ltu best sniper shnicel in your opinion?
[2023-01-04 18:22:18] <%+Fherot> @lunarskitter nerfed a while ago
[2023-01-04 18:22:19] <%presidentrafael> What was the result from the poll??

[2023-01-04 18:22:59] <@%Basleader92> @EasyEight7 it's not great but playable for sure, there's other tanks that ar a lot worse to grind through so I wouldn't spend free XP on skipping it personally

[2023-01-04 18:33:13] <@%Basleader92> @LunarSkitter because marking bad ones during this event is less painfull becuase of extra credit income
[2023-01-04 18:33:19] <augustusrome> this tank does only 200 dmg?
[2023-01-04 18:33:26] <%+kriskaem> I have overall WR above 54% but i cant make Type59 WR higher than 36% Something is very wrong here

[2023-01-04 19:09:50] <LunarSkitter> @friosama it was. way back when all premiums were still available in-game for gold LUL
[2023-01-04 19:09:54] <@%Basleader92> @Fherot tried saying no when he picks Cearn? Kappa
[2023-01-04 19:09:58] <j4mes45> Skill, is the Iron Arnie a good one to pull from the boxes?

[2023-01-04 19:10:33] <@%Basleader92> @NunexTK bond equip isn't really worth it compared to getting a premium which can grind you credits IMO

[2023-01-04 19:52:22] <%+Ernut> was that a bit of stat shaming ?
[2023-01-04 19:52:26] <%+lemkotir_> u well again meet BZ :D
[2023-01-04 19:52:33] <%babilon> phase one 340 heat thats unlucky for you
[2023-01-04 19:52:39] <%+ikeas0fa> why did you rate ebr 105 as max beginner friendly tank? I really want to know @skill4ltu :)
[2023-01-04 19:52:39] <vuuuuuuuuuuk> can someone help when can i buy skorpion g
[2023-01-04 19:52:40] <gen_alex_> @THE___Diablo the problem with WT is the p2w bushes and the grind, no?
[2023-01-04 19:52:46] <Mike_of_All_Trades> @Ernut it was tank shaming
[2023-01-04 19:52:47] <%st4linium_rng> @falcazoid not against bz just 2 shoted meatball frontally ezy pen
[2023-01-04 19:53:00] <Kuebelwagen> @skill4ltu But WG earned maybe 2 Mio. Euro with this tank (10.000 worldwide players 200‚Ç¨ each for loot boxes). So why fire this guy ?
[2023-01-04 19:53:00] <+spinzoub> @Skill4ltu, I wish The Foch plays a week against BZ everywhere and make a salty video as he knows to do
[2023-01-04 19:53:01] <THE___Diablo> @gen_alex_ but power creep cant ceep on going.... if they continoue we will have like 500mm armor plates and 600mm prem ammo soon in the game
[2023-01-04 19:53:08] <%bongcloud42> @skill4ltu will you play with claus kellerman

[2023-01-04 19:53:12] <%+petersulyok96> Half year or maybe more and BZ 176 will be outdated also. XD Or WG will decide to nerf it to the ground and than they will release an another tier VIII prem probably...
[2023-01-04 19:53:18] <%dark_yinepu> @skill4ltu exactly what i like...skill and sarcasm skilLove skilLove skilLove skilLove skilLove
[2023-01-04 19:53:24] <gen_alex_> @THE___Diablo also true
[2023-01-04 19:53:25] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> @vuuuuuuuuuuk WG is putting Skorpion up to sale from time to time, you just need to be patient and wait for them to sell it once more.
[2023-01-04 19:53:32] <THE___Diablo> @gen_alex_ yeah I mean it is for sure, but still cheaper to buy thosoe bushes once instead of whole tank every month :P
[2023-01-04 19:53:34] <%$snausages32> @bongcloud42 claus doesn't play anymore
[2023-01-04 19:53:37] <opos_the_hacker> when was the last time you got a tier 6 mm?
[2023-01-04 19:53:40] <TheUntiltable> Whenever I get mad because of bz, I play a game with arta and if enemy has bz I only shoot him.
[2023-01-04 19:53:42] <vuuuuuuuuuuk> @ItzAndreyZhak ok bro thanks
[2023-01-04 19:53:43] <%+tremicikis> @skill4ltu do you like tanks irl ?
[2023-01-04 19:53:44] <+Toraake> its amazing that caliban and bz are just one year away
[2023-01-04 19:53:45] <shadycharlatan> Next year's loot box tank: hover tank.
[2023-01-04 19:53:45] <THE___Diablo> @gen_alex_ also there is always arcade mode in which bushes dont help
[2023-01-04 19:53:45] <aeng1s> hate the company, not the game VirtualHug
[2023-01-04 19:53:59] <Bosenator> You complain because you care enough about it, to want it to be the best it can be

[2023-01-04 19:55:57] <Mike_of_All_Trades> @StefanUltr4 did you enjoy it?
[2023-01-04 19:56:19] <+StefanUltr4> @Mike_of_All_Trades no
[2023-01-04 19:56:22] <THE___Diablo> @Mike_of_All_Trades yes I do play it and I enjoy it much more than wot
[2023-01-04 19:56:28] <%st4linium_rng> @skill4ltu i cant even do 2k combined with this tank no armor no alpha dmg derp gun wtf xD
[2023-01-04 19:56:30] <Johansson_88> would be interesting if they made a gamemode only with tanks from 2k17
[2023-01-04 19:56:38] <syntrav> su 122 44 3900 dpm is crazy

[2023-01-04 19:57:02] <andrei_anton> @skill4ltu do you know what Top of the Tree will be next?
[2023-01-04 19:57:10] <Mike_of_All_Trades> it's a matter of flavor I guess , played them both but find both games frustrating in a different way

[2023-01-04 19:58:19] <1xSpectraL> gg
[2023-01-04 19:58:23] <nebvbn> If they were to buff the t-44 390 gun like the t-34-2, more dpm and amazing pen, would that outplace the 100mm?
[2023-01-04 19:58:23] <$ElTorro__4ever> Better
[2023-01-04 19:58:24] <%Scowler> @darkdjin it's in the garage, at the bottom right

[2023-01-04 20:02:08] <+Ramino86> 8 games and it's marked
[2023-01-04 20:02:09] <Johansson_88> is this mark more miserable than emil1 mark?
[2023-01-04 20:02:11] <@%Basleader92> @TargaryenNotDany and tanks like E100 can shoot down on your upperplate which is an easy pen, so like Skill said try to play on something that angles the tank backwards

[2023-01-04 20:03:22] <sleepyNessi> @skill4ltu is it worth to get the t-103 so that I have a tank which can better pen BZ-176 and iron arty?
[2023-01-04 20:03:35] <EgIue> speaking of sleepy hello sleepyNessi
[2023-01-04 20:03:36] <blackfeardragon> @skill4ltu you can play more 2 min games per day :)
[2023-01-04 20:03:41] <%+Cutdarthvader2> not much better
[2023-01-04 20:03:50] <%Vlassy> MM before holiday OPS was fine, all good no BZ no tourists

[2023-01-04 20:04:04] <+javamonster10x3> Skill... just want to say... still 10/10 magic :D
[2023-01-04 20:04:08] <d4v3_233> hey @skill4ltu  i wanna ask how do you rate tanks on index page? Cuz i saw vz 55 having 2-3 stars and 5 stars overall and i dont get it,how can combination of bad things work well?
[2023-01-04 20:04:15] <NightKiller77> wot is broken today.... i have 75% wr
[2023-01-04 20:04:19] <%fromkaku> @skill4ltu do you believe EBR 'broke' the meta less than BZ?
[2023-01-04 20:04:19] <%NunexTK> @skill4ltu what was the worst marking experience you ever had?
[2023-01-04 20:04:23] <akseee45> you think the game will be better after holiday ops?
[2023-01-04 20:04:24] <%edevjoe> @skill4ltu I think tech tree version is way more powerful than this tank
[2023-01-04 20:04:24] <martis606> skill just handing out asswipes for enemies
[2023-01-04 20:04:25] <@%Basleader92> @Cutdarthvader2 sucks man, hope it improves, and I understand that daily WR can be really frustrating but as long as your monthly WR or past 3 months is still good it shouldn't matter to much ;)
[2023-01-04 20:04:28] <+Ramino86> 8 more games and it's marked
[2023-01-04 20:04:28] <EgIue> sleepyNessi me too me too

[2023-01-04 20:04:40] <TrioBlitz> @skill4ltu which tech tree line would you recommend to claim the discount from holiday ops?
[2023-01-04 20:04:43] <%bongcloud42> 5k coming?
[2023-01-04 20:04:55] <@%Basleader92> @TrioBlitz the one you're grinding

[2023-01-04 20:05:35] <TrioBlitz> @Basleader92 ah i was think about spending it on another line which i would grind in the future

[2023-01-04 20:05:44] <luketic_> meh
[2023-01-04 20:05:45] <@%Basleader92> VZ-55 isn't epic at anything but good enough at everything which makes it a really good tank
[2023-01-04 20:05:46] <+panzerknacker21671> with APCR
[2023-01-04 20:05:49] <davit1309> @skill4ltu  i cant make wz5
[2023-01-04 20:05:50] <Araiq> No idea, never played it. Waiting for the Top of the tree
[2023-01-04 20:05:51] <%+Durmanush> @skill4ltu no it is underpowered, needs buff, maybe autoreloader 4 shells
[2023-01-04 20:05:51] <shadycharlatan> My VZ 55 still has small PP
[2023-01-04 20:05:54] <%+petersulyok96> The tech tree Caernarvon is better than this premium tank right?
[2023-01-04 20:05:55] <@%Basleader92> @TrioBlitz smart move
[2023-01-04 20:05:56] <%+martelskiy> There is nothing better than being on a ski resort and watching Skill streams in the evening
[2023-01-04 20:06:01] <%bongcloud42> VZ 55 is amazing
[2023-01-04 20:06:01] <%spartans_kill> @skill4ltu sometimes may be good, sometimes may be shit
[2023-01-04 20:06:02] <%+aatuudeetuuR2D2> I have no opinion. I am just a baby baboon.
[2023-01-04 20:06:07] <%+007jackass> @skill4ltu For a heavy tank is it worth going for the IS4 or better to go for the 705A?
[2023-01-04 20:06:14] <baksteen_1> I am going for it now @Skill But the TNH  is holding me back
[2023-01-04 20:06:14] <anonpaweu> Oof
[2023-01-04 20:06:17] <AJCeu> Poor guy

[2023-01-04 20:06:45] <@%Basleader92> @Michaelao they used to have a boost but WG removed it before they came into the game
[2023-01-04 20:06:46] <baksteen_1> And Skill is going into my vz55

[2023-01-04 20:07:52] <TrioBlitz> @Basleader92 thanks @Basleader92 thinking about either the sconq line, the vz55 line or if mediums, the prog 65 or the tvp
[2023-01-04 20:07:58] <%+aatuudeetuuR2D2> (tank commander voice is Chuck)

[2023-01-04 20:08:17] <%+spiritx522> i think BZ make all marking values less on t8 tanks xd
[2023-01-04 20:08:19] <MadisonOne> @bongcloud42 depends on the tank and how you play but honestly I love it on my tds. but probably worse if you play a lot of different tanks

[2023-01-04 20:12:24] <@%Basleader92> @TrioBlitz VZ55 is more current meta, but S Conq is still really good as well and I think a bit easier to play than VZ55
