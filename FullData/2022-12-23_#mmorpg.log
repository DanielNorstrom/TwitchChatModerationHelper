[2022-12-23 16:59:23] <+Metalona> so they would stack with something like a super combat
[2022-12-23 16:59:27] <cyndrakial> Do you have to wait two ticks before attacking initially? @mmorpg
[2022-12-23 16:59:28] <+Metalona> and make you even more busted

[2022-12-23 17:03:16] <+GettinRekt_> GIM was done so poorly its insane
[2022-12-23 17:03:26] <+CleveliOSRS> so if he is NOT a UNRANKED GIM I cannot play with him?
[2022-12-23 17:03:26] <+Metalona> @Lightninglash or just add more content without making a "skill" that gives you even more of a buff than a super combat potion to your skills. Numbers arent everything, we dont need to be able to hit 99s on mobs lmao
[2022-12-23 17:03:33] <+bor97> whats rank 1 kc?
[2022-12-23 17:03:45] <FilipinoGirl> Denise complains your always in the node
[2022-12-23 17:03:59] <+Metalona> Technically jace if you add in clue scrolls haha
[2022-12-23 17:04:04] <Burrkle> Opswronghole
[2022-12-23 17:04:07] <Lightninglash> @Metalona allows casual players to reach the 'old' endgame while allows the best older players to start the new content/explore areas and monsters never before seen before
[2022-12-23 17:04:07] <gurskiii> rank 1 has 15k
[2022-12-23 17:04:07] <Burrkle> lmao 15k kc
[2022-12-23 17:04:13] <Presify> youre rank 1 to us Pog
[2022-12-23 17:04:17] <+CleveliOSRS> Thank you for your answer Curtis, so if he is NOT a UNRANKED GIM I cannot play with him? is this what I got out of it ?
[2022-12-23 17:04:24] <+YoGappa> Confirmed. I switched GIM.. when they recruit you, they will be asked if they want to become an unranked group and they just have to hit yes and you go with all your stats and items
[2022-12-23 17:04:31] <+KentLab_> I hope you dont retake that!

[2022-12-23 17:05:18] <Lightninglash> @Metalona what if the new contientn has an entirely new economy, and a seperate ge form the OLD WORLD
[2022-12-23 17:05:20] <SplungeGunt> oh man you're considering becoming a Softcore Unranked Group Ironman?
[2022-12-23 17:05:22] <+Metalona> @Lightninglash that would completely change oldschool from what people want to keep it to a degree to something completely morphed. yes, current osrs isnt "oldschool" but it has the combat and aesthetic.
[2022-12-23 17:05:26] <+pSharkie> you're rank 1 rex kc haHaa
[2022-12-23 17:05:28] <Lightninglash> @Metalona that would make things so much more interesting
[2022-12-23 17:05:30] <+Metalona> @Lightninglash so.. make a whole new game?

[2022-12-23 17:06:18] <Lightninglash> @Metalona no a game boosted off the old game,because your current achievement will help on this "NEW world"
[2022-12-23 17:06:21] <+pSharkie> do you do the harmony herb patch as well? whats the quickest way there
[2022-12-23 17:06:28] <+CleveliOSRS> bro sorry this is gonna sound really stupid, but his symbol is also blue, but it's like my icon is a bit larger as his and like my icon has bigger mouth or something but he is not green.. lol
[2022-12-23 17:06:32] <+Gicke> i actually hate juggling
[2022-12-23 17:06:45] <+Metalona> @Lightninglash personally, no i dont think it would be worth it. But time will tell on what the masses think

[2022-12-23 17:08:28] <+Metalona> @Lightninglash How would this idea change how the future of the game would be versus without it. It would destroy the whole meaning of the early game and grinding, aka what people play oldschool for, because they can almost immediately do near end game content after a few levels
[2022-12-23 17:08:36] <%thomasgerber> Just derank? @CleveliOSRS
