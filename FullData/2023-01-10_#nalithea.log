[2023-01-10 00:43:45] <%wavemotion1006> They match players on losing streak with players on winning streak
[2023-01-10 00:43:46] <@%zyron999> The other reason is because in 6v6 1 thrower you can make up for better than in 5v5

[2023-01-10 00:45:07] <%Nickgman101> your mmr is what does it
[2023-01-10 00:45:11] <@%zyron999> @Grimstab77 It uses MMR, not SR, and if they link your accounts it can affect your MMR even if your SR is Plat
[2023-01-10 00:45:18] <%Nickgman101> it's all about mmr not sr
[2023-01-10 00:45:22] <@%Grimstab77> Well, my account is currently master 4, and today I played 80% of my games in GM1 lobbies
[2023-01-10 00:45:26] <%$Arx_UK> But remember, SR is not MMR, one person can be Diamond and one person GM, but they can have the same MMR
[2023-01-10 00:45:49] <%$Arx_UK> because the Diamond player hasn't played enough games to get their SR to catch up with their MMR yet
[2023-01-10 00:45:49] <!sappive> i am plat with top 1 mmr :)

[2023-01-10 00:47:13] <@%Grimstab77> Yeah I if the game recognize sim's smurf as a GM player with MMR, he can be matched against GM players or GM MMR players that are smurfing
[2023-01-10 00:47:14] <%Nickgman101> the bigger your win streak the better players you go up against
[2023-01-10 00:47:20] <@%Grimstab77> that's basically how it works

[2023-01-10 00:47:38] <%$Arx_UK> Imagine at the start of Overwatch 2, they reduce everyone's SR by 1000, but they don't change anyone's MMR.
