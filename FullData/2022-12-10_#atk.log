[2022-12-10 10:45:33] <Canidae5> the line indicates the highest for that category
[2022-12-10 10:45:33] <socreatives> golden line or whiteline is highest
[2022-12-10 10:45:34] <%Xsquire> simpew it means you were the highest in that category

[2022-12-10 10:50:19] <estelleluvl> i reallly understand why global server has 99% sorc main players, is really chill class and does big dmg but i preffer flashy classes and supports

[2022-12-10 10:50:45] <smashartist> then why berserkers are treated like that:))
[2022-12-10 10:50:48] <%Marcey97> Sharpshooter just doesnt really stand out in a good or bad way IMO
[2022-12-10 10:50:49] <%+lugachonl3> They just looks not cool enough to play
[2022-12-10 10:50:56] <%+Kaizeo_> u can say outdated

[2022-12-10 10:51:03] <%+Kaizeo_> compared to the rest
[2022-12-10 10:51:06] <socreatives> i wish the sharpshooter had similar weapon switch like GS so bow and swords maybe could have been much better

[2022-12-10 14:24:22] <%ItsDivination> @meemoopy Whatever works, it's a chance either way, and you have to convert them to Brel stones at a 5 to 1 ratio

[2022-12-10 14:57:50] <FallstarAOE> P2W is just a term for a game where you pay to succeed at in game objectives e.g. by increasing player power. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game, but i think it's disingenuous to say that Lost Ark isn't massively P2W/
[2022-12-10 14:57:51] <%+diiarmuid> @NukeMastah i gatekeep everyone above 1520 for that reason
[2022-12-10 14:58:00] <NukeMastah> @NukeMastah PepeLaugh
[2022-12-10 14:58:03] <OPoneKenobi> But paying with time to win is generally more acceptable. Say an athlete spend a lot of time to get good instead of paying to use roids

[2022-12-10 15:00:45] <FallstarAOE> That's fine, but the term P2W has a clear meaning for western audiences, and it's paying with money not time. Ofc you're right that time is still a resource you can 'pay' with.

[2022-12-10 15:02:18] <%BUSTheid> @FallstarAOE I feel like P2W over the years transitioned from straight up paywalls (exclusive cash shop items which make you the best) to getting a time advantage, which is dumb tbh

[2022-12-10 15:03:15] <%StarseekerVII> For something to be P2W I feel like you would have to be blocked from progressing by monetary barriers. For example, a certain boss damage check requiring an item from the store or something.

[2022-12-10 15:05:48] <jambest> depends on the level you define it, you can have the true form which is literal barrier to entry unless you pay, then you have lost ark
[2022-12-10 15:06:02] <EzylKou> @BUSTheid most people havent player a real p2w game (some gachas that require x unit for some content for example) so they dont understand that

[2022-12-10 15:07:59] <%BUSTheid> @FallstarAOE As long as it doesn't affect other players if the low-skill players clear the content, I wouldn't stress the game being P2W too much - if it directly affects someone else that you cleared it by paying and they didn't, then sure
[2022-12-10 15:08:01] <K_y_on> the one with MJ

[2022-12-10 15:08:38] <FallstarAOE> I agree @BUSTheid it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the game, but still does mean the game is not completely free of P2W.

[2022-12-10 15:10:10] <%BUSTheid> Oh ok, I base P2W solely on either being completely paywall gated or affecting other players (ie you'd be able to buy BiS gear in New World for example)
[2022-12-10 15:10:12] <+Sooty_Tooty> Lost Ark do require either very heavy time investment or you pay up

[2022-12-10 18:55:12] <beshaj> Pog
[2022-12-10 18:55:17] <ChaslavTheExile> Yeah you need to decide in advance because it takes a lot of fame to level up other weapons and gear
[2022-12-10 18:55:26] <ChaslavTheExile> later on you level up other gear
[2022-12-10 18:55:29] <OSik099> @ATK thats nothing (well for new people its good) but for veterans its not even one set

[2022-12-10 18:57:18] <%SalemVendetta> I know Lost Ark content is done...but a guy just defended a bot in my Boss Rush run saying he (the bot) will lose its ticket
[2022-12-10 18:57:23] <ChaslavTheExile> Its like a world war
[2022-12-10 18:57:23] <%SalemVendetta> what is this world...

[2022-12-10 18:59:00] <ChaslavTheExile> later on its unplayable xD
[2022-12-10 18:59:03] <ChaslavTheExile> you can't even farm alone ahahha
[2022-12-10 18:59:08] <OSik099> @ATK also you want to stay away from crafting untill you understand the game, there are cartels and stuff so not a good thing to go into uninformed
[2022-12-10 18:59:56] <ChaslavTheExile> Use thos for fame
[2022-12-10 19:00:03] <OSik099> that gives you xp into currently equiped gear
[2022-12-10 19:00:08] <ChaslavTheExile> yeah xp

[2022-12-10 19:04:32] <OSik099> also dungeons (solo) are probably worst source of fame at this point in game probably
[2022-12-10 19:05:08] <OSik099> corrupted prob. is not that better. Open world mobs "age" and those give way more fame
[2022-12-10 19:05:57] <!myodyne> is this #ad ?

[2022-12-10 19:23:16] <OSik099> @ATK depends on the crossbow type, but u want cloth for max dmg with xbows
[2022-12-10 19:23:43] <!myodyne> GIGACHAD just throw arrows by hand
[2022-12-10 19:23:43] <OSik099> Plate = defensive body, Leather is both def and atk. and cloth is for max dmg
[2022-12-10 19:24:17] <OSik099> so Plate you take for CC weapons, leather depends, cloth for healer/dos

[2022-12-10 19:39:58] <OSik099> the only things that could be considered as level is adventure and reaver levels in the B tree
[2022-12-10 19:40:22] <OSik099> reaver affects dmgd done to  and taken from mobs
[2022-12-10 19:40:31] <OSik099> adventure affects capes, mounts, bags you can use
[2022-12-10 19:40:34] VIEWERS: 767
[2022-12-10 19:42:00] <OSik099> basically if you dont wear gear -> you lose the fame, if you are full it goes into fame credits, gathering gear -> lose the fame
[2022-12-10 19:42:13] <OSik099> botom left ish is crossbows
[2022-12-10 19:42:22] <OSik099> its a warrior weapon

[2022-12-10 19:52:15] <OSik099> @ATK because its 4.3

[2022-12-10 19:58:53] <OSik099> also do xbows even have 3 Q ? i remember only auto fire and explosive shot

[2022-12-10 19:59:19] <Kirae_e> so
[2022-12-10 19:59:42] <Kirae_e> thats corrupted one
[2022-12-10 19:59:46] <OSik099> @ATK well 1. your items are (3 tiers lower than what you had before) 2. your reaver level is 4 and you are fighting t5 mobs (the V on bottom right of monster portrait) which means you get hurt more and do less dmg to it
[2022-12-10 20:00:13] <themandarinman> lol

[2022-12-10 20:59:56] <%lostsoulz1010> is there no way to repair in dungeon?
[2022-12-10 21:00:12] <OSik099> nope
[2022-12-10 21:00:30] <OSik099> you are just not supposed to die 20x while inside ;D
[2022-12-10 21:00:34] <+microseiv> the autoattacks are too much for Donki Sadge
[2022-12-10 21:00:46] <%lostsoulz1010> thats rough

[2022-12-10 21:01:51] <OSik099> A out repair, try open world mobs for better fame
[2022-12-10 21:02:04] <OSik099> nope
[2022-12-10 21:02:11] <OSik099> solo dungeons close after 1 min after entry

[2022-12-10 21:03:38] <OSik099> you can repair but it might be cheaper to buy new hard to say economy is a bit wonky in this regard on low tier gear
[2022-12-10 21:05:04] VIEWERS: 557
[2022-12-10 21:05:09] <OSik099> t4.1 is essentially same as t5 gear btw
[2022-12-10 21:06:03] <OSik099> there might be differences in available skills (as some weapon lines dont have all skill till T6 / T5 artifact) but for you it dont matter
[2022-12-10 21:06:10] <OSik099> you can repair one item at a time

[2022-12-10 21:07:30] <OSik099> after done repairing pres M
[2022-12-10 21:07:54] <OSik099> check which town exit has a t4 zone unless you already hit t5 reaver
[2022-12-10 21:08:40] <OSik099> IV = 4, V=5
[2022-12-10 21:08:43] <OSik099> press B
[2022-12-10 21:08:51] <OSik099> go center then follow left the middle line
[2022-12-10 21:09:04] VIEWERS: 572
[2022-12-10 21:09:11] <OSik099> k u got T5 reaver you can do T5 zone
[2022-12-10 21:09:31] <OSik099> master is T6 that don't need to worry you
[2022-12-10 21:10:06] <OSik099> each tier of zone = more fame/mob but also harder mobs. When you were T4 reaver fighting t5 mobs you were oding less dmg and taking more dmg

[2022-12-10 21:12:31] <OSik099> @ATK try open world mobs next time they are bettre fame than solo dungeons
[2022-12-10 21:12:32] <youngdrgn> i used to play it
[2022-12-10 21:12:47] <OSik099> solo dungeons because they are +- safe they have nerfed fame/loot

[2022-12-10 21:13:26] <OSik099> in albion -> level of danger increaes rewards. Blue (safe) zones give less than yellow (semi safe) less than red (pvp danger) or black (full pvp)
