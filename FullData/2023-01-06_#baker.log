[2023-01-06 18:37:15] <%Failchon> sometimes you see reflux, sometimes you see igniter
[2023-01-06 18:37:21] <%Failchon> it depends a lot on how a person plays

[2023-01-06 18:37:59] <%+UnzipsRS> i dont think thats because reflux is stronger KEKW just that the igniters are bad

[2023-01-06 18:39:00] <%SyzzAMV> I mean to be fair - Stoopzz had juiced the fuck up igniters and reflux and the igniters lost every single time - could be skill issue but you NEED to excute igniter or you are ehhh
[2023-01-06 18:39:33] <+klone_iron_fist> what I REALLY love about lost ark is when you watch and avergae player of a class/spec and then watch a god gamer, the difference is insane with all their set up being equal

[2023-01-06 23:19:40] <%+TrickmasteH> Mainly getting all 4 players into same party. We move 2 and 2 each party, then goto the green / purple zone, get moved, then move eachother back to same party in the 2nd zone.
[2023-01-06 23:19:54] <%+TrickmasteH> Cool trick to keep 4 players in same party once merge.
