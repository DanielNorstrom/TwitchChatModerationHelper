[2023-01-03 17:42:40] <Rauvetii> maybe you should swap the dance pad with a controller too

[2023-01-03 17:43:09] <carn1c> can someone help me I am new to co op so i dont know some rules. So about the people in front of malenia's  door. Shoulld I let them solo her or help them?

[2023-01-03 17:43:36] <%brianthebroken85> @brianthebroken85 It's the stagger. So being aggressive and just trying to stagger her. The wondrous physk tear that increases chance of stagger also helps.

[2023-01-03 19:11:54] <%+johnny1111one1> The fact that you're doing *any* of this is impressive. If you get stuck, the headline will still be "Mikkaa beats Elden Ring using in-game equipment as intended." Yes, people will focus on anything they think is "cheating," but the community is already toxic about that.

[2023-01-03 19:16:27] <!%bmap72> and then never used it haha
[2023-01-03 19:16:27] <%RegentOfOrigin> An alternate take on the Wild Strikes thing: I think it works in large part because it's you, and it's carried you a lot through this run. A lot of people have trouble with malenia so seeing someone double delete her with ease would honestly be super impressive. But you feeling good about the run is also super important so
[2023-01-03 19:16:34] <%Berserkr_Bo> she's 6'1
[2023-01-03 19:16:54] <angrybeaver32> No way she's 6'1
