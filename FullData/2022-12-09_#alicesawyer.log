[2022-12-09 22:02:45] <%ARivalAppears> Won't know without seeing. I think normally it's visible enough
[2022-12-09 22:02:55] <~%alicesawyer> its very small on the radio scene
[2022-12-09 22:02:58] <~%alicesawyer> i suppose we can adjust on the go B)

[2022-12-09 22:03:43] <%ARivalAppears> idk I think it's cute like that. The focus of the stream is on the questions so I think it's fine
[2022-12-09 22:04:06] <~%alicesawyer> i like having chat on screen so if somebody watches the VOD 6000 years from now... i don't look like a psycho who talks to themsleves
