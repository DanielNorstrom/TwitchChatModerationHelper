[2022-12-07 17:32:39] <+cisco236> not good against 100 c lutri lists
[2022-12-07 17:32:39] <%+PlaneshiftWill> If you die against mill do you die in real life?
[2022-12-07 17:32:40] <%Aquinas9> Chat rapidly separating into Amulet Lovers v. Amulet Haters. It's like West Side Story CoolStoryBob
[2022-12-07 17:32:45] <YourBoyFuzzySlippers> if you play mill you should only have to win 1 game to take the match
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <%rayjd93> https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5274014#paper
[2022-12-07 17:33:02] <%+SolemnMTG> UR mill with Moons and Galvanic Iterations
[2022-12-07 17:33:09] <ValeckSeimu> y he s not olayn the land dat give us a plain if it get destroyed
[2022-12-07 17:33:09] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Someone has AmuLIT the beacon...
[2022-12-07 17:33:24] <%rayjd93> This v2, I’m committed to trying to get this to work, but most just committed to having fun
[2022-12-07 17:33:31] <%+swinda_> Think Bosh n Roll did a video on this one @aspiringspike
[2022-12-07 17:33:35] <+Carneage> I am in the school of thought that if you want to test if a card is good in a deck, it is tough to do that with 2 or fewer copies which I think is what is happening here @rdrk
[2022-12-07 17:33:35] <%Nillarvis> wasnt greater good an old combo deck
[2022-12-07 17:33:37] <%tugboatmaguire36> yo is that the bosh n roll deck?
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Haha check out bosh and rolls dragon deck video if you didnt know about greater good (posted yesterday)
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <%rayjd93> Binding could not work, mana was tough
[2022-12-07 17:33:39] <ValeckSeimu> gift ungiven?
[2022-12-07 17:33:42] <+sirkonradd> !card greater good
[2022-12-07 17:33:42] <@%^MTGBot> Greater Good, {2GG} | Enchantment | Sacrifice a creature: Draw cards equal to the sacrificed creature's power, then discard three cards.
[2022-12-07 17:33:44] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> I'm 90% surte I lost to this deck in standard.
[2022-12-07 17:33:46] <Renroh> dono KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:33:47] <@%+ItsSimonDS> that's a lot of 4s
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <@%+DoctorBodgapopolus> i just had a flashback to extended with this list LUL
[2022-12-07 17:33:50] <%Aquinas9> Oh man, BoshnRoll was just playing this Greater Good deck on his channel. It did NOT go well. I think this chatter is using v.2.
[2022-12-07 17:33:52] <%+alp_mtg> 2 Regrowth
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%+sinalco87> good vs Tashas Laughter
[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <+HealthLoss> so... play more and add karuga? Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:34:21] <%+alp_mtg> Wasn't this a standard deck? It played Kodamas Reach and Steve at that time
[2022-12-07 17:34:22] <aghi16> @aspiringspike hey they won't lose to Tasha's Hideous Laughter though!!!
[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <+Peachvizzle> There is an old standard version of that deck that looks better
[2022-12-07 17:34:30] <%lucuzo54> unless you have 8 black lotuses
[2022-12-07 17:34:31] <BobTheNinja23> Its to fight against the tasha's I'm guessing?
[2022-12-07 17:34:35] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> The secret sauce is playing two yoseis to stack the triggers.
[2022-12-07 17:34:36] <%rayjd93> Direction was to make the early game control focused.
[2022-12-07 17:34:40] <%forward_aerial> @aquinas9  I watched that video last night, cool idea, but deck seemed like ass tbh
[2022-12-07 17:34:48] <+MCFraught> Like the WKUK hot dog sketch... "How many 4+ drops would you say, in an average deck?"
[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <%logo6719> Greater good isn’t modern legal lol
[2022-12-07 17:34:56] <ValeckSeimu> this is a good deck in DRAFT LU
[2022-12-07 17:34:56] <%Aquinas9> @forward_aerial Lol, so right.
[2022-12-07 17:34:57] <%+swinda_> @logo6719 yes it is :)
[2022-12-07 17:35:07] <%logo6719> What set?
[2022-12-07 17:35:07] <%+Banebot> Goryo giant thing that does neat stuff when it dies, then sac it for 2 cards ez
[2022-12-07 17:35:14] <%+Softnum> Spike can you ask op for their decklist plz?
[2022-12-07 17:35:15] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Yeah it was in a core set. Saw it in standard, Kami-Ravnica
[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <+loureeds> battlebond i think
[2022-12-07 17:35:24] <%+swinda_> ninth editionb
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <%+alp_mtg> They were inspired by this old T2 deck https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/standard/jack-tien/gifts-ungiven/39142
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <%Aquinas9> I think Greater Good was a legitimate deck in Extended. That window closed in 2008.
[2022-12-07 17:35:30] <%rayjd93> Yosei taps and “time walks” opp.
[2022-12-07 17:35:32] <+BOLO4J> just watched this deck or similar last night on either thraben or bosh
[2022-12-07 17:35:37] <lilpumpkin121> What happened to the reshape deck from yesterday? Seemed really cool
[2022-12-07 17:35:37] <+Pika500> this looks like an EDH deck
[2022-12-07 17:35:43] <%logo6719> Didn’t know 9th was legal lol
[2022-12-07 17:35:45] <%+swinda_> you can just check gatherer and scryfall :) but also mtggoldfish will alert you if its not legal
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <pochesun> 15 bucks well spent lol
[2022-12-07 17:35:59] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Theyre actually just inspired by boshnroll's video today
[2022-12-07 17:36:01] <%+rdrk> does hidetsugu kinda replace explosives?
[2022-12-07 17:36:05] <@%+ItsSimonDS> @lilpumpkin121 it uhhh didn't go well
[2022-12-07 17:36:11] <chikokumang> hana kami death denied infinite value PogBones
[2022-12-07 17:36:12] <+BOLO4J> I would just go like the old small package, from when gifts ran things like loam
[2022-12-07 17:36:19] <ValeckSeimu> 1K ? just buy 30th anniverdary proxy tho
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <+sirkonradd> !card yosei
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <@%^MTGBot> Yosei, the Morning Star, {4WW} | Legendary Creature — Dragon Spirit 5/5 | Flying / When Yosei, the Morning Star dies, target player skips their next untap step. Tap up to five target permanents that player controls.
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <Ross_Merriam> If you want to time walk your opponent in Modern you can do it for 5 mana and 1 card.

[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <%+meanfannypack> $15 for a deck tech, $150 for spike to tell you your bad deck is good
[2022-12-07 17:37:17] <%+devoncoltrane> Can I post a link to a Bosh N Roll video about a similar deck to the deck tech spike?
[2022-12-07 17:37:45] <%fourdeltavictor> Remember when there was a "confidence boost" channel point redemption where spike would tell you your deck was perfect?
[2022-12-07 17:37:50] <%fourdeltavictor> Those were the days

[2022-12-07 17:39:19] <%Aquinas9> @DrTerrier Yeah, I believe this deck tech is for the updated version (Bryan added Prismatic Ending, Teferi, and Verdict at the end of the video).
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <%d0gula> Whew almost didn’t make it out of the mana tithe boom bust landfall deck
[2022-12-07 17:39:49] <%rayjd93> Thanks for the deck tech! In the sauce

[2022-12-07 17:40:17] <%+mailuburu> Time to refill channel points
[2022-12-07 17:40:27] <%+eedo> since i moved to the netherlands, you can't bet channel points and it has made IMPOSSIBLE to become VIP
[2022-12-07 17:40:29] <!%Hotashi> dont burn out!
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <patricklj> can you run an ad before this match?
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Initial impression, intent good? I'll be playing this deck this weekend and trying to pick a list
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <+DrTerrier> @Aquinas9 no way thats the updated version, it's still playing the wonky cards no?
[2022-12-07 17:40:35] <+ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney> was that the intent?
[2022-12-07 17:40:39] <+DrTerrier> Like Kokusho and stuff
[2022-12-07 17:40:43] <+darkovyaa> what exactly is a bad matchup for this deck?

[2022-12-07 17:41:28] <%Aquinas9> @DrTerrier Compare the deck tech to the end of Bosh's video. I think it lines up. I could be wrong.
[2022-12-07 17:41:29] <Ross_Merriam> I don't care about variety. I'm only here for comfy Lucy vibes.
[2022-12-07 17:41:33] <Ohunt3r> Hey spike its me here to ask an annoying question :) Thoughts on UW leyline binding control in modern at the moment?
[2022-12-07 17:41:39] <WanderThereYonder> shoot, missed the prediction

[2022-12-07 17:44:18] <half_taco12> It always feels like whatever deck you’re most comfortable with is the best deck to play
[2022-12-07 17:44:18] <ValeckSeimu> btw i saw a Infect player 5-0 monkaS

[2022-12-07 17:44:57] <ValeckSeimu> couse murktide is top 4
[2022-12-07 17:45:06] <HERETI_CO> U Tron is basically the best deck in the format no doubt
[2022-12-07 17:45:12] <%+devoncoltrane> Mirktide is like UW control and Jund. Copium
[2022-12-07 17:45:15] <Ksmith78> @mememachine18 can't stop the meme

[2022-12-07 17:45:33] <@%+ItsSimonDS> swing out opponent
[2022-12-07 17:45:34] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Murktide is ACTUALLY Mid, not magic-mid (which means bad)
[2022-12-07 17:45:37] <@%+ItsSimonDS> what's the worst that could happen
[2022-12-07 17:45:54] <ValeckSeimu> every deck with EI is top 3
[2022-12-07 17:45:55] <%+juicybrick> i think people call it the best because of how adaptable it is and just generically good but i dont think it's ever the best
[2022-12-07 17:45:56] <nleal2> yawgmoth always has the highest win rate @aspiringspike
[2022-12-07 17:45:57] <%+mailuburu> Which are your most disliked meta deck?

[2022-12-07 18:01:47] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Turn 1 fury against murktide. Didn't believe in it, but did the math and it was way better than I thought

[2022-12-07 18:02:13] <%ARichards24> I just find that t1 fury into t2 dashed ragavan seems way stronger than rag first. That is just what I've found though

[2022-12-07 18:02:32] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Yeah I also prefer fury into turn 2 dash ragavan
