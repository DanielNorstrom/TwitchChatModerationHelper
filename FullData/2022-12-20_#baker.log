[2022-12-20 19:51:07] <purplecakee> i have 2 chars at 1485 and cant enter in a clown party

[2022-12-20 19:53:56] <purplecakee> yeah but thats the thing i outdamage or at least be alive in some vykas hards
[2022-12-20 19:54:04] <purplecakee> when demon roars die
[2022-12-20 19:54:07] <purplecakee> or do no damage
[2022-12-20 19:54:29] VIEWERS: 622
[2022-12-20 19:54:38] <purplecakee> so having vykas tittle is not enough to enter in a clown party?
[2022-12-20 19:54:50] <purplecakee> since that was the last raid before it
[2022-12-20 19:55:10] <+FireZky> its not
[2022-12-20 19:55:10] <Spootyboots> I think roster level is a terrible way to gatekeep, it only proves that they want to do horizonal content, nothing to do with skill
[2022-12-20 19:55:11] <cloc_toc> Yeah the reality is, if you are not willing to start groups and you are "behind" then you are just going to make yourself unhappy
[2022-12-20 19:55:12] <+FireZky> u need clown title
[2022-12-20 19:55:40] <purplecakee> so to do clown for the first time i need clown tittle
[2022-12-20 19:55:44] <purplecakee> i dont think it works that way
[2022-12-20 19:55:50] <+FireZky> i try actual 3 hours find ppl to clown
[2022-12-20 19:55:57] <+FireZky> i think i try enough for it
[2022-12-20 19:56:02] <+Private_Shorty> @purplecakee No, you need to make your own clown group and title it learning party
[2022-12-20 19:56:07] <Spootyboots> show your collectables

[2022-12-20 19:57:57] <Spootyboots> honestly I feel like your an exception
[2022-12-20 19:58:07] <+Nerdpoints> im 96 roster and im still a noob
[2022-12-20 19:58:18] <Spootyboots> most i've seen with high roster level has mostly all done
[2022-12-20 19:58:29] <cloc_toc> I unfortunately lost my main account just before brel and am currently only 103 roster. Rarely do i even feel gate kept by my roster level

[2022-12-20 20:01:26] <+FireZky> and u get in with rainbow stats
[2022-12-20 20:01:30] <+FireZky> i seen it so many times
[2022-12-20 20:01:39] <Spootyboots> ok then i'd agree with you about roster level
[2022-12-20 20:01:55] <+mayed167> Game doesn't gatekeep... party leaders do.. just get around them. create your own party or apply to a leader with similar game experience.
[2022-12-20 20:02:03] <@%+strengthie> Is it possible that some of the people being "gate kept" are just shitty and never bothered to learn fights and are getting removed?

[2022-12-20 20:02:34] <%naujokas3> bro i got so unlucky today
[2022-12-20 20:02:46] <+mayed167> you wana apply to parties that are good, you gotta be at least equally good... if you're a 6.. don't go hitting on a 10
[2022-12-20 20:02:46] <%naujokas3> it took me 30 taps on my weapon for quality and it went from 58-59..
[2022-12-20 20:02:49] <plz_spam_t0ucan> nah its because they dont allow dps meter
[2022-12-20 20:02:51] <purplecakee> im pushing my last alt thats a striker what should i run for a 4x3 build deathblow?
[2022-12-20 20:03:05] <plz_spam_t0ucan> if they allowed it they would just kick the people with low dps instead of gatekeeping by random shit like roster lvl
[2022-12-20 20:04:05] <%naujokas3> i just did another weapon tap went from 59 to 74 atleast abit better

[2022-12-20 22:27:56] <%Kristolicious> the fact that the term "jailed" even exists, show how bad the gatekeeping is
[2022-12-20 22:28:54] <%+Niki_xyOn> its not gatekeeping if someone fails 3 times in a row and noone applies for gate 2 xD
[2022-12-20 22:29:09] <%Kristolicious> people consider themselfs "jailed" after 2 wipes, a dude cant even make mistakes without someone calling jailed, so people opt for getting carried by overgearing instead

[2022-12-20 22:29:37] <%+Niki_xyOn> i consider 40 min in gate 2 as jailed
[2022-12-20 22:29:37] <%Kristolicious> leaving new guys in the dust, which also means in the long run, it will kill the game

[2022-12-20 22:32:03] <%Kristolicious> @polig I mean sure, but putting in rewards for teaching someone is still gonna take time, which means you STILL wont have time for your raids, so that hardly helps
[2022-12-20 22:32:03] <+FireZky> Problem some ppl think "becaus i can everyone can"
[2022-12-20 22:32:04] <%polig> find guild at that suits you
[2022-12-20 22:32:08] <%polig> create groups
[2022-12-20 22:32:10] <+FireZky> that mentality is something else

[2022-12-20 22:35:53] <%polig> @Kristolicious i dont know in RU i had somewhat casual guild with which i managed to get to learn things and on some things i tried to organize learning groups myself, sometimes you need to just make group yourself

[2022-12-20 22:36:49] <%polig> exactly there is plenty of people who get gatekept and they will join you
[2022-12-20 22:36:59] <%+Niki_xyOn> noone wants to be like this, but with limited time you want to have fun, and getting wiped and wiped again doesnt make fun, then i could waste my time anywhere else, sounds bad, but is the reality for most of us
[2022-12-20 22:37:26] VIEWERS: 474
[2022-12-20 22:38:08] <%polig> you are gatekept in any game that has any chance of wasting someone's time, its not just LA issue
[2022-12-20 22:38:30] <%+Niki_xyOn> the only tip you can give against gatekeeping is to rotate sups with other ppl, only thing that helps
[2022-12-20 22:38:33] <%Kristolicious> LA has it by far the worst though
[2022-12-20 22:38:42] <%Kristolicious> Of the games and MMOs  played at the least
