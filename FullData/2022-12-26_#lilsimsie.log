[2022-12-26 17:00:12] <xikanlittle> my sim won the lottery once
[2022-12-26 17:00:15] <+luizadutra> I NEVER won the lottery this game must hate me :(
[2022-12-26 17:00:19] <esther_idk> I won lottery only once when I deleted everyone else
[2022-12-26 17:00:19] <the_greatest_JJ> You really win the motherload
[2022-12-26 17:00:21] <@%+MrsTomato101814> sometimes i make rich sims burn money in the fireplace just for funsies
[2022-12-26 17:00:22] <joseption> i need that problem in my life
[2022-12-26 17:00:26] <+Rheeth> i am playin a family right now with 200k+ money and at this ponit i don't know what should i do
[2022-12-26 17:00:26] <%+caseyisoutoftouch> i wish i could win the lottery irl but i dont like it in the sims either. too much money takes the fun away i think
[2022-12-26 17:00:30] <%north_cub> @esther_idk this made me snort
[2022-12-26 17:00:34] <%mcgoddess2> entered the lottery and my sim's baby daddy that she doesn't talk to won
[2022-12-26 17:00:35] <averyroz> although. my sims who won the lottery also had triplets so I feel like something was really off with that save's randomization
[2022-12-26 17:00:35] <electric_saprotroph> my not so berry family won the lottery and now i'm like????? what do i do????? they are a three sim household, i'm not gonna get i giant house lol

[2022-12-26 17:00:38] <%afrench1520> i won one time but i dont remember what i did with it
[2022-12-26 17:00:38] <heyitsrandi23> even when i won i still made them go to work cause i hated having them not do anything üò≠
[2022-12-26 17:00:39] <ostothewin> my legacy save once won lottery so I changed the storyline and made them snobbish until they finally went poor again
[2022-12-26 17:00:39] <%justRayxox> Oh yeah that‚Äôs excessive
[2022-12-26 17:00:40] <anndutchie> i dont know what to do with all this money in the sims
[2022-12-26 17:00:41] <%+katertot098> Lol I meant ur not urn oops
[2022-12-26 17:00:41] <strawberrydaiquirie> @sapphire_m00n_ I like them to have a bunch of money because I love to go over the top decorating. What I never do is cheat their cooking skill, because I make them cook a bunch of meals and then throw parties to eat it all

[2022-12-26 17:18:18] <+mastersheps> I have bought grocery store cheesecake from cheesecake factory but it's just not the same experience as being in the restaurant. TPFufun
[2022-12-26 17:18:20] <heather__feather> their appetizers are the size of entrees

[2022-12-26 17:18:21] <%+eggomymeggo730> The cheesecake honestly is fairly decent
[2022-12-26 17:18:21] <%+darknstormy_nails> its so much food too
