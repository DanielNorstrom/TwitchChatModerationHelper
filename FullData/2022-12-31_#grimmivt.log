[2022-12-31 03:30:05] <%supersweethoneybunny> Jones is probably stuck in a storyline quest and can't leave until he resolves it.

[2022-12-31 03:30:39] <%kabii_sama> the wiki says it's determined which one warps you per dream, but I've heard people talking about datamining this game saying the guy that warps you gets reshuffled each time you reenter the map

[2022-12-31 03:59:28] <%ArthurAbbott> Today was a 5 hour stream and 50% of it was zatsu
[2022-12-31 03:59:28] <%SaiaiChan> oh, so they're like grimmi sometimes
[2022-12-31 03:59:28] <thehousemasterr> he has autusm
[2022-12-31 03:59:36] <%$Tempest_52> Arthur 1000% has ADHD

[2022-12-31 04:00:52] <!%socialistOtter> so what you're saying is Arthur is weak

[2022-12-31 04:01:04] <%supersweethoneybunny> Thats a full waffle house night shift grimmi, thats not normal
[2022-12-31 04:01:23] <%indigokin> Not going left, going along the left wall
[2022-12-31 04:01:33] <%LeonidasUmbra> she doesn't get the concept of following the left wall
[2022-12-31 04:01:36] <%$Tempest_52> Grimmi cannot stick to walls
[2022-12-31 04:01:44] <!%socialistOtter> she doesn't know how mazes work, Jones
[2022-12-31 04:01:55] <%indigokin> Missed a wall
[2022-12-31 04:02:00] <%synapse_0000> Every curve and entrance you skip is a wall you are not sticking to
[2022-12-31 04:02:10] <SirRyu> makes sense
[2022-12-31 04:02:11] <%SaiaiChan> this isn't a normal maze though
[2022-12-31 04:02:22] <SirRyu> lol
[2022-12-31 04:02:28] <CotePathos> Main issue here is Isolated segments that loop around

[2022-12-31 04:02:49] <!%socialistOtter> that maze does have disconnected islands but if you're not Grimmi you do eventually notice you're looping
[2022-12-31 04:03:00] <SirRyu> LOL
[2022-12-31 04:03:01] <%SaiaiChan> @synapse_0000 It loops though
[2022-12-31 04:03:06] <@%GrevlenNOX> Something that always impresses me is when Grimmi tells me she had a good day eating and sleeping and then she says she was up for 36 hours, I think Grimmi's standards are just different
[2022-12-31 04:03:15] <%kabii_sama> ...
