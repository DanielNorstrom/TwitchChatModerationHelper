[2023-01-05 00:12:26] <CrowFlies00> rule of thumb is once you stop having fun, it is far easier to pick and complain about something
[2023-01-05 00:12:28] <+SLZF> he needs to switch that to toggle mute so he can talk

[2023-01-05 01:18:25] <%lI_Phantom_lI> Should hide screen before you join map so you don’t get sniped man
[2023-01-05 01:18:25] <%IUltraxx> @HutchMF steamer mode does not shit, it still shows your name. Since this wipe people dont see you in pre-lobby andymore, only if you look for people/group, dont listen to this guy

[2023-01-05 01:51:26] <+dr_thrax010> they said they would though
[2023-01-05 01:51:27] <%sleepyjuicee> actually u can add Tarkov to steam manually
[2023-01-05 01:51:29] <+Stealerb> this game will never go to steam.  they also don't want the negative reviews from new players
[2023-01-05 01:51:30] <@%$astrosardonic> A little bit?  They take a lot
[2023-01-05 01:51:32] <SimmonsGS> they cant launder money using steam
[2023-01-05 01:51:33] <airair64> Imagine letting 30% of profit be taken away lol. They are good righ tnow
[2023-01-05 01:51:40] <%rogue_zar> Reaching a larger audience
[2023-01-05 01:51:43] <%CReaper210> There is the possibility that the game gets exposed to way more people on steam though

[2023-01-05 01:52:15] <%+MF_Monsters> you need more wires
[2023-01-05 01:52:15] <EskimoBrather> but you also get exposure on steam, probably a tradeoff

[2023-01-05 03:58:45] <%Bailz94> bad comms to thinking it's judd
[2023-01-05 03:58:52] <%MXIPOV> He doesn't know to peak it better bc no comms from Judd. So yes it's not entirely his fault
[2023-01-05 03:58:57] <+Diamond_dt> bro he ran way the fuck in there, can't do that in tarkov
[2023-01-05 03:58:58] <%Wootloops> that wasn't a peek. that was a "run in to the hallway and look". you learn and move on
[2023-01-05 03:59:10] <@%^StreamElements> Check out HutchMF's YouTube at: https://youtube.com/c/HutchMF
[2023-01-05 03:59:19] <%MXIPOV> Judd was already in there fighting.
[2023-01-05 03:59:23] <smokekg> he was 2nd floor
[2023-01-05 03:59:23] <%MXIPOV> No good comms letting him know someone is on first

[2023-01-05 03:59:45] <%+Rway27> he didnt know where judd was upon entry had to ask when he sees some one. ded
[2023-01-05 03:59:46] <%Bailz94> like I said he needs to pick up the game start of wipe before trying to teach new players
[2023-01-05 04:00:03] <MOBBII_Q> 1 death and summit is ready to quit again LUL
[2023-01-05 04:00:13] <%lI_Phantom_lI> Judd told Jared like 1min before that he was in the 2 story with Curtis
[2023-01-05 04:00:20] <%itsgolfman> That’s the problem. Everyone is in a separate building doing their own thing instead of sticking together

[2023-01-05 04:08:41] <+VViking98> @sonyx777 the game is not made to have fun tho, its made for the 1% players who likes to be punished for doing something

[2023-01-05 04:09:18] <%+RoninTheCollector> @jokerjoe he’s not having fun, and he doesn’t seem to notice he need a legit vacation. Not a day or two, like two weeks off.
[2023-01-05 04:09:18] <smokekg> TBH summit has been complaining about every game he plays. Give him a few hours and he will be madling at SOT lol
[2023-01-05 04:09:19] <%BreakZw> @scavsherenowayman I mean, no, he can just stop playing if he doesn't like it. It's that simple. he's not Tweaking for not liking something lol

[2023-01-05 04:09:23] <Jaken70> is summit over reacting or is the game worth playing?

[2023-01-05 04:09:55] <+lleoj> @Jaken70 the game is not good
[2023-01-05 04:09:58] <+eiznooN> @Jaken70 IMO its worth. No other grind like it
[2023-01-05 04:09:58] <+NovaScotiaBred> If it’s not inertia it’s the audio or the de-sync or the scavs or anything else
[2023-01-05 04:10:01] <+jokerjoe> @roninthecollector  totally agree, he needs to take a month off or something

[2023-01-05 04:10:20] <%$MansaTTV> @Jaken70 the game is great.
[2023-01-05 04:10:21] <Bambi_AKz> Deep Inside Summit loves EFT, but it Hurts Him obviously. when I DiE and got back to MainMenu I am FULL Reset   :D
[2023-01-05 04:10:23] <+priest_holmes> @HutchMF now that Summit has rage quit you are my go to Tarkov streamer
[2023-01-05 04:10:30] <%MrZomb1es> Hutch is just pissed because thats his boy and he enjoys playing the game so much with him

[2023-01-05 04:10:42] <%demonboix> nah just from watching him hes been getting just fucked. audio is dogshit crazy cheaters and no ones seems like they give a shit about the game problems but instead look shiny new map with a way more fkn problems that wasnt resolved
[2023-01-05 04:10:44] <scavsherenowayman> @BreakZw He is tweaking because he is calling the game shit just because he gets mad when he dies. obv he can just stop playing but he tries to make a point and prove how bad the game is and his arguments are stupid.
[2023-01-05 04:10:44] <%SeeraX2> @Jaken70 @Jaken70 Cheaters is the worst thing. Other things are all good, the grind and everything
[2023-01-05 04:10:48] <$cVn44> youre mom sounds kinda fucked
[2023-01-05 04:10:48] <+Silvia240> @Jaken70 he quits every wipe, nothing new
[2023-01-05 04:10:52] <Playermodd> summit needs to play with willerz, running around with noobs doesnt help
[2023-01-05 04:10:55] <%theStudyGaming> Everyone’s different chat, we all like and dislike things, but just imagine having to deal with serious emotions in front of thousands of people. Y’all gotta take it easy

[2023-01-05 04:11:13] <B3KA> when devs start adding annoying as mechanics for the sake of "realism" it's over.
[2023-01-05 04:11:15] <ZTheReaper> God I love VOIP in this game.
[2023-01-05 04:11:15] <%BreakZw> @eggysaint no ofc not haha he is just unhappy with the game

[2023-01-05 04:12:06] <HabitualButtonPusher> It just sucks with that steep learning curve and being new + all the issues makes the game rage inducing

[2023-01-05 04:13:30] <%Bailz94> yup comes back to wipe and he's expected to teach / carry squad of new players... needs to play with experienced people at first
[2023-01-05 04:13:31] <B3KA> concept of the game is so good bu what can you do
[2023-01-05 04:13:32] <+Braska7> It is a lot of communication to play more than 2

[2023-01-05 04:13:51] <Bambi_AKz> @HUTCH but if it has PROBLEMS, Why Summit does Positive STREAM Description, 1 Hour Later Negative Description aka Tarkov sucks. and then later on it's all good. Then rather ROAST da FUQ out of BSG  and speak how we all feel about it.  Sound/Server Code
[2023-01-05 04:13:51] <%+itsbuffinmuffin> man i just wish we had some hutch summit duos
[2023-01-05 04:13:52] <atpickle> wonder who killed him
[2023-01-05 04:13:52] <lurkerbibb> @meta_rayjr same here that ego comes out
[2023-01-05 04:14:01] <%IUltraxx> summit is out of EFT since intertia is in the game. Thats it

[2023-01-05 04:14:16] <%stuffowf> tark... one of the only game where playing with friends isn't necessarily more fun
[2023-01-05 04:14:16] <%+RoninTheCollector> @meta_rayjr ya man… sucks to enjoy his content and constantly have him get into this headspace, tough to watch over and over.
[2023-01-05 04:14:17] <l1lch0de96> I honestly sucked at the game but still played to just hang out with my friends
[2023-01-05 04:14:18] <+jmh8509> @meta_rayjr That's me rn lol
[2023-01-05 04:14:20] <MajoraSW> sum has to lower expectations

[2023-01-05 04:14:25] <NCartwright15> It seems like he tries to play EFT like CoD or CS.

[2023-01-05 04:23:07] <+SpernWhale> i personally dont like how much this game favors giga chads based on how much bossses spawn now and how little keycards
[2023-01-05 04:23:09] <+koolkguy> @HutchMF maybe see if curtis wants to play?
[2023-01-05 04:23:09] <+tru3purp> @Bailz94 how did you know lol.. all i said was try and learn the mechanics a little more and try to take it a little slower and well bang here i am!

[2023-01-05 04:24:45] <+DropSkizm> @Bailz94 I'm not disagreeing, I think some of the mechanics shoot themselves in the foot to be a great looter shooter. Game rewards camping more than looting and running around

[2023-01-05 04:24:46] <lurkerbibb> angry child ban me hutch

[2023-01-05 05:02:38] <scavsherenowayman> pre-lubing would make it so when his leg gets blacked he can still move and isnt hobbling around
[2023-01-05 05:02:44] <+TheGr8Dayne> if anything should give you an adrenaline boost

[2023-01-05 05:02:49] <+koolkguy> Does pk just let you move like normal or does it do anything else?
[2023-01-05 05:02:51] <evanp1922> @swen24 It wouldn't stagger and slow his movement
[2023-01-05 05:02:52] <%+DrewGamer> @swen24 allows you to ignore blacked limbs (so you don't hobble or have terrible gun sway)
[2023-01-05 05:02:52] <%+DiMEMM0> You can just hit key morphine and use it before fight if you have time they’re so quick
[2023-01-05 05:02:54] <%+jm0on> yea having blacked legs is extremely punishing
[2023-01-05 05:02:55] <khrukmstr> @swen24 a painkiller would allow him to continue to run, instead of limp
[2023-01-05 05:03:05] <+swen24> oh ok got it

[2023-01-05 05:04:32] <+Dubyuu_> I was thinking about that before, when you get shot you should get like an adrenalin rush which allows you you to move for like 3 - 5 seconds then drops out stamin unless its leg fracture/black

[2023-01-05 05:37:58] <Samiboy1511> @hutchmf you have probably been asked this question a thousand times, but what map do you recommend for newer player ?
[2023-01-05 05:37:59] <%Bailz94> problem with lighthouse is you have to loot at crack head speed as its open loot
[2023-01-05 05:38:27] <jakelewisreal> woah woah what is this DTS thing, is there a video going over how it helps, specifically with the new tarkov audio?

[2023-01-05 23:50:17] <Puke_tv> he is not wrong :D
[2023-01-05 23:50:18] <+Parental_Advisery> just wants to play the game the way he wants to play it. not the way it needs to be played which is fair enough.
[2023-01-05 23:50:20] <gregoryiscute> and it goes away

[2023-01-05 23:50:47] <gregoryiscute> it takes time to level up strength to make inertia almost gone and he doesn't realize I guess
[2023-01-05 23:50:49] <hustleman850> he said how difficult do i want my day to be
[2023-01-05 23:50:50] <%Bailz94> it's not half as bad as what hes making it out to be though. but I'm probably fully adjusted to it now
[2023-01-05 23:50:54] <%GOW1N28> he gets you off dayz to play gta he lasts 8 days ish on tark
[2023-01-05 23:50:55] <+bigfatpurple> @parental_advisery I disagree he likes the game when it was less realistic without weight which is a fine opinion to have imo
[2023-01-05 23:50:55] <+itz_yiddy65> What sound enhancement does hutch use chat, please?
[2023-01-05 23:51:02] <%+TheGameForce> I think he's biggest problem is the way he enjoys the game is fundamentally against how the devs are updating the game
[2023-01-05 23:51:03] <+GeneraIDude> i remember him complaining about people doing the wiggle peak a couple wipes ago, now he says he wants that back
[2023-01-05 23:51:11] <+Parental_Advisery> I think biggest problem is he WANTS to like the game and just cant because of things outside of his control
[2023-01-05 23:51:15] <%huueygaming> Ello Hutch how we doin today
[2023-01-05 23:51:16] <%GOW1N28> love sum but hes lost love for games to just play and enjoy
