[2022-12-30 05:25:26] <%WalkTheFox> !yulha
[2022-12-30 05:25:26] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-30 05:46:18] <420generic> ml ray i mean
[2022-12-30 05:46:26] <Patatepon> i mean didnt know that she will be in the mystics rotation
[2022-12-30 05:46:27] <coolsilverstar> its jenas hero NOWAY
[2022-12-30 05:46:30] <%sum1Kind> @Jenazad clilias,riolet,lionehart,arby next rotation after ml ray
[2022-12-30 05:46:37] <%barald> I will never pull for Belian. Remove her
[2022-12-30 05:46:38] <HzHammy> what kind of comps is she good with
[2022-12-30 05:46:40] <%rein_kraus> I saved up 20 pulls for Belian hope I get her
[2022-12-30 05:46:41] <%Rasiro_> ML Celine can work rarely with great gear in specific circumstances. Great unit.
[2022-12-30 05:46:44] <%rein_kraus> ok
[2022-12-30 05:46:50] <%ML_Zahhak> Guys i think ML Ray is op, but i think you need ML Flan.  With ML Ray and 250 effectiveness ml flan you can control the entire match
[2022-12-30 05:46:52] <%Douma1302> maid chloe armpit yumyum
[2022-12-30 05:46:56] <+MisterKira7> ml ray is worse than the first venom unit since he requires someone else to apply injury
[2022-12-30 05:47:08] <%+noxozora> Riolet worth the coins? Got 40… jenazTrigger
[2022-12-30 05:47:20] <just303030> @ML_Zahhak and then Green Armin counters and stuns your entire team KEKW
[2022-12-30 05:47:29] <HzHammy> what kinds of comps is belian good for
[2022-12-30 05:47:31] <%rein_kraus> They could be so much more creative with their units
[2022-12-30 05:47:33] <%sum1Kind> @Jenazad i was right about belian rotation. just they didnt put aravi inside because she had a rerun due to her rta skin
[2022-12-30 05:47:34] <%ML_Zahhak> @just303030 no one picks green armin, ever
[2022-12-30 05:47:34] <nyxxlul> 250 eff just to get 15%ed ICANT

[2022-12-30 05:47:38] <%Rasiro_> I think ML Ray is gonna be a huge game changer for non-meta lobbies.
[2022-12-30 05:47:42] <+DarkTuner> Apoc Ravi vs. C Lilias for Selector?  Or are there any others I should consider?

[2022-12-30 05:50:53] <%sum1Kind> @HzHammy go for clilias instead of belian, she gets pre-ban a lot.
[2022-12-30 05:50:54] <%Z1nsmiter> is epic7x up to date?
[2022-12-30 05:50:56] <%+customgrower> i kinda regret taking handguy over stene :( never should have chosen a dude
[2022-12-30 05:51:07] <%+SaveTehWorld> I only use e7x for looking up characters skills and seeing like cata info. everything else is bad.
[2022-12-30 05:51:09] <%AuKi39> @Z1nsmiter in the sense of adding new units, kinda.

[2022-12-30 05:51:17] <+Sylpix> Does immunity matter on Briseria?

[2022-12-30 08:26:09] <%Mr_Sparcler> you know what would be interesting? when they decide to change a character, they put the character in a special trial state, they give her the change, and still reserve rights for additional tweaks once people have tested the unit in actuality and after few tweaks lock in the final one and then start the proper unit recall, imo this would work a bit better, everyone has more say and with increased chance of unit still being usable post changes, its subsequent banners could be more profitable

[2022-12-30 08:41:40] <Fethalarani> @jenazad Giselle and Karina are good in PVE but bad in PVP
[2022-12-30 08:41:43] <aespafan1> hehe
[2022-12-30 08:41:43] <tolaz0> s2 should proc on herself as well
[2022-12-30 08:41:46] <potatosamb> thats way too much
[2022-12-30 08:41:52] <tunococman> her damage relies on arti too
[2022-12-30 08:41:53] <%noresindansgame> KEKW
[2022-12-30 08:41:53] <morrseh> and also her passive needs to proc on herself

[2022-12-30 08:41:54] <%hinagikukatsurachan> yah, her multiplier is so shit

[2022-12-30 08:42:06] <aespafan1> ye, more dmg is good
[2022-12-30 08:42:06] <potatosamb> maybe senya multiplier

[2022-12-30 08:42:11] <+WarauTR> big numbers
[2022-12-30 08:42:11] <+ApePecs> I think self-cleanse is much more valuable
[2022-12-30 08:42:15] <MysteIic> i think her damage is fine as is - but the issue is she often is missing the defense buff so she loses out on alot of damage ; so instead of def buff proc on s2, maybe make it so def buff on s3 before attack @Jenazad
[2022-12-30 08:42:16] <kasukuroki> Im watching you
[2022-12-30 08:42:17] <%Evaligon> sounds like someone misses hwayoung

[2022-12-30 08:42:23] <+SavingJ> now thats a lotta damage
[2022-12-30 08:42:23] <souvlaki5910> give her passive 30% DEF ok
[2022-12-30 08:42:24] <KIaasje> Not every unit needs to be good in PVP tho Sadge
[2022-12-30 08:42:24] <Fethalarani> The damage on the showcase video? TPFufun
[2022-12-30 08:42:25] <+ApePecs> because then you build her def set and invest the er stats into more def

[2022-12-30 08:53:52] <+ApePecs> I think the thing that bugs me most about the AESPA collab is that the unit designs were really lazy

[2022-12-30 08:54:00] <%casseerolee> Consider that 10 transmit stones would be a 3*

[2022-12-30 08:55:00] <MysteIic> winter is the nicest kit wise
[2022-12-30 08:55:01] <chodi_b> better to get the imprints with gold transmit instead of elson copies
[2022-12-30 08:55:01] <Deezy_Nilla> ningning was first RGB barrier inversion which is kinda a big deal since only other option is ML5

[2022-12-30 08:59:44] <Aam_Shagar> Roy is like whale STene
[2022-12-30 08:59:51] <unclipse> water units don't counter roy's mechanics it's outspeeding or gear gapping with tank gear that does it KEKW
[2022-12-30 08:59:55] <%Xamess> ok
[2022-12-30 08:59:56] <dazai1v9> but then he needs 240 speed to follow up and no damage

[2022-12-30 09:00:37] <%FruziaFTW> jena please tell us whats the next underrrated op unit like yulha
[2022-12-30 09:00:37] <atlasxvi_> I used him on LS set, I'm always surprised on how much damage he deals. He 2 taps def buffed Belians with mit like how crazy is that.

[2022-12-30 09:00:42] <SozNerfed> it was decent ok
[2022-12-30 09:00:44] <HzHammy> is rimuru not good anymore?
[2022-12-30 09:00:51] <%Sabdog> You just reminded me that Riza Hawkeye is a unit
[2022-12-30 09:00:51] <+ApePecs> FMA was flavorful, powerful units
[2022-12-30 09:00:59] <nyxxlul> ICANT and we thought riza was the best of the 3 back then
[2022-12-30 09:01:01] <%+IronTetsuo> Does any1 use Riza nowadays for anything...?
[2022-12-30 09:01:03] <%casseerolee> It'd be nice if Riza had a niche somewhere
[2022-12-30 09:01:03] <%nowimpanickin> worst collab was re:zero but the units were dope
[2022-12-30 09:01:04] <thefrozenhero> ICANT
[2022-12-30 09:01:04] <Aam_Shagar> And everybody forgot Riza
[2022-12-30 09:01:06] <kasukuroki> ....So when rolling out the feedback that Tagah Book should not stack and a new 5* Guild arti that gives 20 souls+the first sb that cost 10 souls is free once per battle?

[2022-12-30 09:01:13] <tolaz0> did they buff after the collab finished?
[2022-12-30 09:01:19] <%JollyRagerFPS> ngl riza isn't that bad
[2022-12-30 09:01:21] <+mipples0409> best collab most op is rimuru
[2022-12-30 09:01:21] <%ElTrigeno> would it be better to go for immunity, eff res, or hp alongside speed for yulha?
[2022-12-30 09:01:24] <MysteIic> @Jenazad i think riza has her place - as best pve support for 1 shot
[2022-12-30 09:01:38] <@%Lacari> books stacking is fine
[2022-12-30 09:01:42] <%Rasiro_> I remember when people thought Riza was gonna be the best collab unit
[2022-12-30 09:01:44] <+ApePecs> Like look at Riza's unique protection ability and compare it to something totally boring and useless like Giselle
[2022-12-30 09:01:49] <@%Lacari> it adds more skill to the game
[2022-12-30 09:01:52] <nyxxlul> ignore er soulburns are not fine ok
[2022-12-30 09:01:53] <@%Lacari> because you need to be aware of mages
[2022-12-30 09:01:56] <%sum1Kind> if book cannot stack means belian stocks will go down
[2022-12-30 09:01:57] <+mipples0409> rnl proc'ng twice in a row shouldn't be a thing
[2022-12-30 09:01:57] <@%Lacari> theres ways to counter it
[2022-12-30 09:02:02] <inferno2918> @jenazad let us stack PoV then :)
[2022-12-30 09:02:03] <%boneymcboneman_> I like the book stacking
[2022-12-30 09:02:03] <Deezy_Nilla> mages just shouldn't come with extra turn SB
[2022-12-30 09:02:04] <!%PotatoesHUH> I like belian so I'm ok with books ok
[2022-12-30 09:02:06] <%Rakjaar> Every cleave unit a mage KEKW

[2022-12-30 09:02:21] <%nowimpanickin> I think if book is unstackable it makes other mage artys better and makes what soulburn you use more impactful personally

[2022-12-30 09:02:25] <peepperjulius> hello @jenazad I have come to you so you may help me I was told clilias is the logical choice but here's the thing I only now have 29 days and I don't if I will have enough time to get clilias from headhunt so would it be better to just choose briar or rehunt and try for clilias
[2022-12-30 09:02:30] <rhnshad0w> I use Riza in banshee one shot
[2022-12-30 09:02:36] <+sociallink> I think they should just remove belian and not let books stack like top guilds suggested they should in year 1 @Jenazad
[2022-12-30 09:02:42] <nyxxlul> FeelsStrongMan

[2022-12-30 09:05:12] <kasukuroki> You know whats also cool, not letting people play with speed gapping and Lua plays
[2022-12-30 09:05:12] <Tig3rKnee> book stacking makes almost every other mage arti useless lol
[2022-12-30 09:05:18] <nyxxlul> i think flidica shouldn't have an ignore er soulburn ok
[2022-12-30 09:05:18] <@%Lacari> knight and mage artis are just trash honestly
[2022-12-30 09:05:21] <%Rasiro_> I like book stacking, I just hate that book is so overwhelming for mage artifacts. I want variety
[2022-12-30 09:05:23] <Mohixter> should I go for ML kawerick or SSV from headhunting?
[2022-12-30 09:05:25] <samusthunder> my humble suggestion: take dark corvus and make it a pen set, it increases an unbelievable 3% of damage in s1 and s3, the most stolen for any content, even more than stene
[2022-12-30 09:05:29] <@%Lacari> theres only like 3-4 in each catagory that are good
[2022-12-30 09:05:38] <@%Lacari> nah thats not true
[2022-12-30 09:05:41] <@%Lacari> mage artis are just bad
[2022-12-30 09:05:47] <+DarkTuner> Is there any reason to build Taeyou?
[2022-12-30 09:05:47] <CinCinDaisuki> they just need to make a good mage arti
[2022-12-30 09:05:50] <CinCinDaisuki> the rest bad
[2022-12-30 09:05:57] <@%Lacari> theres only 2 others that are good
[2022-12-30 09:06:01] <@%Lacari> abyssal crown and fairytale
[2022-12-30 09:06:05] <@%Lacari> and they JUST buffed fairytale
[2022-12-30 09:06:11] <kasukuroki> Sezans Arti is pretty good
[2022-12-30 09:06:13] <Shirousa> @Lacari to be fair, there are only like 12 five star knights in the game,
[2022-12-30 09:06:16] <%Mr_Sparcler> book stacking is fine because of belian and artifacts like ran's that remove nearly full book on trigger
[2022-12-30 09:06:17] <nyxxlul> ICANT literally just a stat stick
[2022-12-30 09:06:20] <%noresindansgame> 4Head jut get it bro

[2022-12-30 09:06:36] <%nowimpanickin> @Lacari yeah no I think that there are benefits to book stacking and cool combos that come out of it, however I think that you'd have more cool combos if they did some sort of mage arty rework and made book unstackable
[2022-12-30 09:06:44] <JoeK5> No saving Knowledge Seed

[2022-12-30 10:00:31] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-30 10:35:13] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-30 11:05:07] <skoomah69420> but we get UrTrippin from aespa
[2022-12-30 11:05:08] <shanerater> one can cope
[2022-12-30 11:05:13] <%lLord> i just started counterside and they have a holo live collab
[2022-12-30 11:05:16] <just303030> what we need is FGO collab EZ
[2022-12-30 11:05:18] <@%ProfessorBloak> Oh shit okay
[2022-12-30 11:05:18] <%ie_g> kiara popping off with the gacha collabs she was just in cs holo myth collab and now she's doing a song for e7 ? xD
[2022-12-30 11:05:24] <%akciel> definitely, I'd take holo collab over aespa ahy time
[2022-12-30 11:05:29] <%beaup> Elena got a good design tho 💯

[2022-12-30 11:05:52] <skoomah69420> kpop is much bigger but vtubers probably have higher conversion rate, probably a wash

[2022-12-30 11:05:57] <myouimina94> came back to e7 after 5 months for aespa

[2022-12-30 11:06:07] <just303030> vtubers and gacha players are overlapping, gacha players and kpop normies arent
[2022-12-30 11:06:11] <%akciel> not saying aespa collab is bad, but smth they just dont really fit in e7 I think
[2022-12-30 11:06:13] <0RE0N> Gura s3 turning into Forsen Pog
[2022-12-30 11:06:21] <Droiver> @whitebase82 the biggest vtuber group in the world

[2022-12-30 11:06:29] <%nagsenpai> holo live makes more sense, kpop fans that also play gacha games can't be a high rate of them

[2022-12-30 11:07:14] <LaSaizel> just dont make them characters if they collab

[2022-12-30 11:08:22] <maganashaker> Cookie run is pretty generous unless you want to whale to top pvp
[2022-12-30 11:08:22] <%Xamess> Rip fgo sponshorship KEKW
[2022-12-30 11:08:22] <Droiver> @Jenazad pekora was a good example, the news of her playing the games was huge in the fgo community
[2022-12-30 11:08:22] <just303030> oh yeah the biggest uma musume whales in KR are kpop artists
[2022-12-30 11:08:26] <%nagsenpai> I think japanese games in general don't care about content creators
[2022-12-30 11:08:26] <%WalkTheFox> if u had to choose one restaurant to eat for a year, wat wud u choose? @Jenazad

[2022-12-30 11:08:39] <%+laxiusvp> fgo is carried by art and story i think

[2022-12-30 11:19:08] <%Zetaphax> I only like ranch dressing on carrots. I cannot eat it with literally anything else.

[2022-12-30 11:19:14] <%ie_g> it smells like spoiled milk

[2022-12-30 11:19:29] <%+demios4540> i used to work at a regional burger chain that did not have ranch.  got customers from the midwest who walked out after waiting 20 minutes to order when they found out we didn't have it
[2022-12-30 11:19:30] <%+GrayMagikarp> different pizza places have different ranches, though. some are garbage and some are amazing
