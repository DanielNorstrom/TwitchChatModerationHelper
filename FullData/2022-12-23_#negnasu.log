[2022-12-23 13:16:20] <DMphobia> I mean, in the older style video game consoles like the Atari Purple was commonly used to indicate shadows--and thus darkness--on black backgrounds
[2022-12-23 13:16:38] <%TheLastTriceratops> FACTS light mode is inferior. Light modes are often pure white and dark modes are often pure black because developers don't know what 'shades' are. Pure black looks better than pure white
