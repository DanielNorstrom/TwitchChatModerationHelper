[2022-12-23 13:16:19] <%Artourr> Is that rock star nasu?
[2022-12-23 13:16:20] <DMphobia> I mean, in the older style video game consoles like the Atari Purple was commonly used to indicate shadows--and thus darkness--on black backgrounds
[2022-12-23 13:16:38] <%TheLastTriceratops> FACTS light mode is inferior. Light modes are often pure white and dark modes are often pure black because developers don't know what 'shades' are. Pure black looks better than pure white
[2022-12-23 13:16:40] <%carlosboom22> your drawing looks like a character from genshin impact.

[2022-12-23 14:43:44] <%Argomundo> I wouldnt mind harem so much if the writers wouldnt sck at writing it

[2022-12-23 14:44:47] <DMphobia> I enjoy Slice o' Life anime like that. Lucky Star is like my guilty pleasure anime in that it feels like it shouldn't be something I enjoy, but I love it
[2022-12-23 14:44:53] <%Argomundo> My first non tv anime was Zero no Tsukaima which is a 'tolerable' harem
[2022-12-23 14:45:16] <%krymz0nstreams> I love Tenchi Muyo because Tenchi is an actual character in his show and you can see him frustrated but resigned to his situation
[2022-12-23 14:45:36] <%+EvinGod> My first and second anime are pretty awesome to this day, dont think thay class as harem though Cardacaptor Sakura and Escaflowne
[2022-12-23 14:45:42] <%Argomundo> wouldnt say ZnT aged very well
[2022-12-23 14:45:53] <!%ClioAite> Terrace House had the incident where one of the people on the show was bullied online so much that they ended up taking their life
