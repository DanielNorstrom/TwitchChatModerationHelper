[2022-12-07 12:49:16] <xe97x> is mid R9 worth it or is ginola better for price?
[2022-12-07 12:49:22] <+YoneCast> ye.. Portugal and Brazil are looking scary no lie
[2022-12-07 12:49:38] <%+gdodds455> boufal for 40k is an unreal card
[2022-12-07 12:49:53] <%+gdodds455> Switzerland were awful
[2022-12-07 12:49:55] <dzsangtcho> your Jersey bro i love it üá©üáøüî•

[2022-12-07 12:50:13] <%+V3nom85> Winner of France v England makes it to the final I think.
[2022-12-07 12:50:18] <%+PineapplePUBES> Maybe not if Saiss is injured, he's massive for them and played extra time with his hamstring all wrapped up at the back
[2022-12-07 12:50:30] <lfc_777> W
[2022-12-07 12:50:36] <!%ma4rten> portugal is way better than spain, and had to win against spain on pens
