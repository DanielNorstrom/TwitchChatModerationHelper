[2022-12-11 08:22:43] <%$WorkingHardTieflingBard> tinkaton is the definition of fuck around and find out
[2022-12-11 08:22:58] <%CalisAlley> tinkaton is 10/10 design, the design is violence and i love it
[2022-12-11 08:23:02] <%$mayachooo> your surprise of the violence from a pokemon that makes a hammer out of pokemon it has killed?
[2022-12-11 08:23:11] <%sweetbloodseth> Tinkaton is the definition of 'quiet kid memes'
[2022-12-11 08:23:15] <%+Dumbass_Gremlin> @sweetbloodseth isnt the reason like laid out in the pokedex entires. isnt it because corviknights steal their hammers when they are baby
[2022-12-11 08:23:24] <@%carthage67> Apparently one of the most broken pokemon in this generation is the family of mice, it learns a move that can attack 10 in 1 turn
[2022-12-11 08:23:38] <!%$PaperxRose> yeah moushold
[2022-12-11 08:23:50] <!%$PaperxRose> 4 of them

[2022-12-11 12:37:47] <%mikks_wav> I actually think appletun or whatever is cute, but i think it'd be cuter if it was just a weird chonky dragon
[2022-12-11 12:37:49] <@%Shaktihana> nagiquDerp
[2022-12-11 12:37:51] <%mikks_wav> instead of being an apple turnover
[2022-12-11 12:37:59] <%mikks_wav> "food" is a dumb theme for a pokemon imo
[2022-12-11 12:38:19] <%kharnchampionofkhorne> Tho ig it would be an insane amount of work to include the old gens on top of all the new stuff so understandable
[2022-12-11 12:38:26] <%Libiteena> If it was a weird chonky dragon it'd just be more forgetabble than if it was a boi who can provide ya free pie anytime.
[2022-12-11 12:38:27] <%mikks_wav> @kharnchampionofkhorne not that much, they're mostly modeled already
[2022-12-11 12:38:28] <LunaWolfclaw> @Rennslyaer if you want to keep seeing pokemon as an innocent game, don't read the pokedex entries of some of the pokemon, there's a few that's dark
[2022-12-11 12:38:30] <%mikks_wav> its more for game balance.
[2022-12-11 12:38:32] <Wall_Lock> i am still creeped out by these vehicle pokemon

[2022-12-11 12:39:36] <%mikks_wav> rock types are inanimate objects for the most part though

[2022-12-11 12:40:33] <%mikks_wav> renn just doesnt like them because she's infatuated with the boring "cute fairy' aesthetic of gen 6 lol
[2022-12-11 12:40:34] <%Libiteena> he said anything based on inanimate objects.
[2022-12-11 12:40:42] <%kharnchampionofkhorne> I love that my boi Aron literally eats the metal off of railroads. Doesnt imply anything about messed up train tracks or anything wdym? LUL

[2022-12-11 12:42:21] <+TomoAries> X and Y is aesthetically superior, it has the best Pokemon design, its revivals are so lovely and full of color, the towns are beautiful, the gyms are pretty, it's the best game
[2022-12-11 12:42:31] <!%$PaperxRose> xy was one of the easiest

[2022-12-11 12:43:20] <%mikks_wav> its art direction was decidedly "meh"
[2022-12-11 12:43:21] <%Libiteena> Kleffkey is THE WORST DESIGN

[2022-12-11 12:43:40] <!%$PaperxRose> i love booboo keys
[2022-12-11 12:43:43] <%mikks_wav> it was missing compelling gameplay

[2022-12-11 13:09:21] <@%TheMoenia> Cheer100 fun fact about vaporeon: did you know that In Pokémon Yellow, Vaporeon is programmed to learn both Haze and Mist at level 42; however, a bug prevents a Pokémon from learning more than one move at the same level when leveled up outside of Pokémon Day Care, so Vaporeon can only learn Mist if it reaches level 42 in Pokémon Day Care.

[2022-12-11 13:42:34] <%kharnchampionofkhorne> nah, he'll just go straight Kiriyu
[2022-12-11 13:42:46] <%CaptainHounde> He doesn't even shake like everyone else does when they use it. That means he must secretly be VERY strong.

[2022-12-11 13:57:39] <%+HoratiusTheDwarf> the color does serve a purpose but its mechanically complicated and involves another pokemon and both of them being in a doubles battle

[2022-12-11 15:14:31] <%LordSkizzik> may i mention another creature collection game that may or may not be to your liking renn ?
[2022-12-11 15:14:45] <!%+BastenCathulhu> I don't have an issue with the game, but then again, I grew up in a day where games didn't ever hand-hold ya. x.x
[2022-12-11 15:14:57] <balrabbus> The yellow pad at this pokymon center, you are supposed to be able to use the pokymon materials there.
[2022-12-11 15:14:58] <!%+BastenCathulhu> Blue and Red were limited to hardware restraints!
[2022-12-11 15:15:00] <@%TheMoenia> digimon cybersleuth is the superior pokemon game you cannot change my mind
