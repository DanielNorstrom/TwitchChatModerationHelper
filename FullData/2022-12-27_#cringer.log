[2022-12-27 14:12:16] <%trivialmind> Hmm. So they'll use the Cold War stuff and the Soviets as the bad guys?
[2022-12-27 14:12:21] <VilneeusSchoolmaster> Maybe Indy is going to go to the moon… moon landing July 31 1969 wasn’t it lol
[2022-12-27 14:12:31] <%RyuSheng> it's nazis again
[2022-12-27 14:12:47] <%sshen13> ya it's something about the space race, at least that's what the sypnosis says

[2022-12-27 14:12:58] <H2O4S> And another clip of Carrie Fisher trying to remember how she got the role.. "I banged some dude. I hope it was George".
[2022-12-27 14:13:14] <%trivialmind> Nazis and zombies, the two things it's ok to shoot in games and movies.
[2022-12-27 14:13:37] <VilneeusSchoolmaster> I wonder if they’ll remaster old footage not used from the first Indy movies for fbs flashbacks
