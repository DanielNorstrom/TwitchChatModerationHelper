[2022-12-24 05:08:06] <%Ezzlin> Oh right, even if you use Sahabot you have to use the link to the main website
[2022-12-24 05:08:31] <%Ezzlin> Yeah it's unfortunate that the main website is kind of inflexible
[2022-12-24 05:08:32] <madskirl> Dark Mode add-on for your browser is paramount.

[2022-12-24 05:46:20] <%+Hyperstryke> That's why I say it breaks the world.
[2022-12-24 05:46:38] <%MhikaLharona> also because 0 means nothing, and numbers only can define 'something' and not 'nothing'
[2022-12-24 05:46:45] <@%ReynZephyr> I once crashed a MUD with an in game calculator by trying to divide by 0
