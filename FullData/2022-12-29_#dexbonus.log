[2022-12-29 14:45:36] <$rosemaster888> That's actually kinda genius, i might borrow that idea
[2022-12-29 14:45:40] <+OhHelloMere> It's really great to hear this conversation. My husband works from home so does a lot of the household things and since I work outside of the home I do feel the "guilt" of not being a 'good wife' who takes care of the house like he does.

[2022-12-29 14:45:53] <IndieBuns> oh hey, thats exactly what my mom did too when i was little! she hired a cleaner, feel bad to dump the whole job on her, so they split the jobs
[2022-12-29 14:45:58] <%candyandcloves> doogHug
[2022-12-29 14:46:03] <@%Amarienn> @Amarienn yeah my parents did not do it on purpose and as I was growing up and questioning these things my mom especially agreed that me and my brother should share all kinds of chores but these things leave their impact on you
[2022-12-29 14:46:31] <%konataizumi1982> My husband def takes on the majority of the household chores, though he does a lot of it while I am still working
[2022-12-29 14:46:34] <%smoonsky6> the second cleaning is for someone elses needs im down. if its just for me my brain says nah bro
[2022-12-29 14:46:46] <%$Tannah_ONeill> Its interesting to see what people consider clean, I find this can be a real friction point in relationships..
[2022-12-29 14:46:46] <%DecadaentAusterity> personal standards of tidiness can also be really hard to navigate
[2022-12-29 14:46:53] <%tellyrose_> @lunanne oh I getcha, I have ptsd issues involving people entering my home so I totally understand that allowing someone in is another challenge on top. I hope you find a solution that suits your situation, don't be ashamed for needing or wanting help sometimes doogHug

[2022-12-29 14:47:19] <+MrDarthGaber> @smoonsky6 same. god id love to be a stay at home husband who did housework for a partner that worked lol
[2022-12-29 14:47:20] <custardmeshi> in my culture the regular practice in having someone come clean your house would be that you'd clean beside them most of the time but it's considered a little on the upper middle class bar so not everyone does it
[2022-12-29 14:47:42] <%floneus_lufts_dreames> Doogs your so awesome. I wish you much luck with making your home happy and wonderful!
[2022-12-29 14:47:55] <%Beatrice0> @Amarienn Totally agree.  I still remember one time where I like took the trash out because it was full and you know, it needed to be done.  I'd never done it or had it assigned.  Next week I was scolded for NOT doing it.  I was then asked a few years later why I never took initiative around the house and cited this specific issue.  My folks were stunned.

[2022-12-29 14:47:59] <%candyandcloves> that leads me down a logic rabbit hole of maybe families shouldn't be a small unit, it should be a community that divides tasks not just two adults. In a perfect world and all that
[2022-12-29 14:48:11] <+Xjere> yeah, even more than just terms of cleaning, creating definitions is important for any relationship.

[2022-12-29 14:48:42] <%DecadaentAusterity> on a related note, I keep telling my mom to engage me when she needs help, but she is used to doing everything herself and I am a slow starter on my own
[2022-12-29 14:48:47] <@%Amarienn> @Amarienn yeah that is also very common

[2022-12-29 14:48:58] <%+commanderavocado> I see this argument a lot with bedmaking, some people don't make the bed because they argue its going to get messed up again, others wanting to make it regardless

[2022-12-29 14:49:49] <%konataizumi1982> I grew up similarly to that my mom was a person who did everything herself and I didnt learn until later on how to do a lot of household chores
[2022-12-29 14:49:51] <%Beatrice0> @jstpeaches Because no one actually likes hanging around toxic hate mongers, but it also takes folks actively cultivating the opposite to end up where you want to be.  This has occurred here.

[2022-12-29 14:50:01] <winteristda> I did an absolute 50% with a previous domestic partner and it became a lot of aggressive negotiating as to where that 50-50 line was. Now the idea of 50-50 just gives me anxiety lol
[2022-12-29 14:50:23] <%laemia_arkane> what will always amuse but also annoy me is my mom saying "I don't want stuff to pile up on the kitchen counter" and then being the one always piling stuff there.

[2022-12-29 14:50:29] <ThrynValravn> if my brainspace starts slipping, cleaning is legit the first thing out the window and i kinda hate it. causing problems for future me when the brainfog clears  stripBurn (at least i live solo so its not ruining other peoples space)
[2022-12-29 14:50:31] <@%+AlexRatman> Hoovering is very cathartic to me; especially when I learnt about "hoover lines" and the perfectionist in me is like "gotta make those lines straight"
[2022-12-29 14:50:37] <%konataizumi1982> roombas are also great for people like me who are a bit lazy about vacuuming

[2022-12-29 14:51:46] <+divineheretic> My wife and I decided it was the most fair for us specifically if I did the general house basics as long as I don't have to do the literbox ever again.

[2022-12-29 14:55:18] <%konataizumi1982> the biggest thing for me is my husband is always on my case about putting stuff in the dishwasher right away vs the sink

[2022-12-29 15:08:45] <Jellooze> it all depend on the freezer and how you packaged the meat. Vacuum packed last longer and those auto defrost freezers apparantly warm up the walls and if the meet is in contact with the wall there is a thaw freeze cycle going on and its not good

[2022-12-29 15:14:05] <bluubeard> Does that apply both ways? Like I for sure feel less performative for the younger gen but still feel pressure with the older gen
[2022-12-29 15:14:11] <ashy_h> one thing to keep in mind is that old people clothes used to be young people clothes, so seeing young photos of old people, it seems like they dress older, but they were dressing time appropriate
[2022-12-29 15:14:19] <%$Tannah_ONeill> I really try not to compare myself to my parents. As they had a house, several cars, a boat, and a shop full of tools, by the time they were my age.. And here I am still renting..

[2022-12-29 15:16:44] <%+QueirdKryptid> lego has a botanical collection now! I want all of it

[2022-12-29 16:05:35] <%Sangkster> As someone who was bullied for not having as nice clothes as the others, I can say uniforms are a godsend (I experienced both in my school)

[2022-12-29 16:06:27] <Leysfort> uniforms suck but hey they are all equal at school so good luck finding ur kid in a crowd
[2022-12-29 16:06:32] <Nemonal> I feel like kids will find a way to bully others regardless LUL
[2022-12-29 16:06:32] <Drathak> if they provide ample uniforms for free perhaps but I rarely see a school that does that
[2022-12-29 16:06:36] <%DecadaentAusterity> uniforms aren't the problem, just how strictly they are enforced

[2022-12-29 16:06:41] <%Badgerconda_> as someone who never knew (and still doesn't) how to dress, and got relentlessly bullied over my second hand clothes and stuff, i would have loved to have uniforms.
[2022-12-29 16:06:45] <%W_Tile> I hate them with all my heart :)
[2022-12-29 16:06:55] <+El_raginho> the main reason they have them is to teach kids to be good little drones
[2022-12-29 16:06:58] <%Sangkster> but I do agree it is harder work on the parents in keeping the child wearing the right thing at the right time lol
[2022-12-29 16:07:10] <Heltoff> I did not think they started with uniforms that early though. Thoguht it was 6 years up or something like that
[2022-12-29 16:07:11] <%nickoftime16> doogCoffee
[2022-12-29 16:07:13] <Abeautifulpigeon> I had uniforms up until highschool
[2022-12-29 16:07:55] <%Sangkster> how's the nametags on the uniforms, have you finished sewing all of them on?
[2022-12-29 16:08:07] <+Xjere> I wore uniforms in middleschool, and the big problem there was if you couldn't afford uniforms after a growth spurt you were stuck with ill fitting or ratty stuff. But this is probably primarily a USA problem.
[2022-12-29 16:08:13] <ToasterWings> I had uniforms in high school. Wasn't bad. I wore a chained wallet as self expression lol

[2022-12-29 16:08:52] <Heltoff> So you pay for the uniforms, or does the school provide?
[2022-12-29 16:08:52] <ToasterWings> @DecadaentAusterity right? LUL
[2022-12-29 16:09:01] <Nemonal> wait but what if you have to resell it

[2022-12-29 16:09:58] <Nemonal> ooh mb
[2022-12-29 16:10:00] <+Snangle> @Heltoff Reception onwards you wear a uniform, so age 4 + upwards
[2022-12-29 16:10:09] <%+Caxsry> I had uniform accommodations in place because of my sensory needs (I can't wear polo style tops at all) They would rather I went to school in the wrong uniform than never go in because I couldn't put on the 'right' uniform
