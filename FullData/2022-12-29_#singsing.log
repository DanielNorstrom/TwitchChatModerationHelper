[2022-12-29 01:48:57] <%trolsopol> Camera? Battery?
[2022-12-29 01:49:12] <%Xepionic> also depends what you use it for
[2022-12-29 01:49:18] <%trolsopol> Affordable?
[2022-12-29 01:49:37] <!%Sscuzzy> camera is whatever since my current one is dog
[2022-12-29 01:50:11] <!%Sscuzzy> under 1k prolly. though im getting swayed by fucking foldables
[2022-12-29 01:51:02] <%Xepionic> do you play games on your phone?
[2022-12-29 01:51:07] <%Xepionic> and do you Piratege them?

[2022-12-29 01:51:40] <%trolsopol> Pixels are okey
[2022-12-29 01:51:42] <%Xepionic> screen size?
[2022-12-29 01:51:50] <%Xepionic> do you like smaller screens?
[2022-12-29 01:51:55] <!%Sscuzzy> small is fine
[2022-12-29 01:52:00] <!%Sscuzzy> but i think hz matters more
[2022-12-29 01:52:05] <%Xepionic> zenfone 9
[2022-12-29 01:52:16] <!%Sscuzzy> if pixel 6a actually had proper refresh it would have been great
[2022-12-29 01:52:17] <%trolsopol> YEPP zenfone is also very good
[2022-12-29 01:52:43] <%Xepionic> isnt really big
[2022-12-29 01:52:55] <%Xepionic> and 120hz
[2022-12-29 01:53:03] <%trolsopol> Xiaomi mi series are nice
[2022-12-29 01:53:21] <!%Sscuzzy> i used mi before its fine but
[2022-12-29 01:53:27] <!%Sscuzzy> their OS are wonky
[2022-12-29 01:53:30] <%trolsopol> Not sure how they work in sng world. I know for eu they are kinda bad because of chinese embargos
[2022-12-29 01:53:36] <!%Sscuzzy> they can either break shit in updates
[2022-12-29 01:53:40] <%trolsopol> OhISee
[2022-12-29 01:53:50] <%Xepionic> mi phones are nice but OS kept crashing for me
[2022-12-29 01:54:03] <!%Sscuzzy> i got my mum a mi 11t? earlier
[2022-12-29 01:54:09] <!%Sscuzzy> the em

[2022-12-29 01:54:18] <!%Sscuzzy> navigation buttons were insufferable
[2022-12-29 01:54:25] <!%Sscuzzy> unresponsive and laggy
[2022-12-29 01:54:32] <%Xepionic> well i had it like 7 years ago i think
[2022-12-29 01:54:33] <!%Sscuzzy> then somehow it got fix in a os update
[2022-12-29 01:54:38] <%Xepionic> so it was pretty unpolished PepeLaf
[2022-12-29 01:54:45] <%trolsopol> I have oneplus 6t but think that newer one s are shit
[2022-12-29 01:54:58] <%Xepionic> or you could wait til they release s23
[2022-12-29 01:55:03] <%trolsopol> So wouldn't reccomend it
[2022-12-29 01:55:09] <%Xepionic> it would still be under 1k

[2022-12-29 01:57:09] <%Xepionic> so cant comment on it
[2022-12-29 01:57:24] <!%Sscuzzy> but is china only etc
[2022-12-29 01:57:38] <!%Sscuzzy> so apps might not play nice on it, like banking apps etc
[2022-12-29 01:57:39] <%trolsopol> Isnt oppo just cheap oneplus ? Thinkge
[2022-12-29 01:57:46] <%Xepionic> i think so

[2022-12-29 01:58:05] <!%Sscuzzy> theres alot of branding under BBK
[2022-12-29 01:58:18] <!%Sscuzzy> i guess realme or vivo is the cheaper branding
[2022-12-29 01:58:31] <!%Sscuzzy> wait realme might be under xiaomi
[2022-12-29 01:58:59] <%Xepionic> wasnt it redmi under xiaomi?

[2022-12-29 02:02:46] <!LinLin_nn> i dont think pixel is good price wise
[2022-12-29 02:02:53] <%trolsopol> But zenfone is very good battery
[2022-12-29 02:02:53] <!LinLin_nn> wouldnt a poco be better?
[2022-12-29 02:03:19] <!%Sscuzzy> pixel has a bigger batt
[2022-12-29 02:03:26] <%trolsopol> Poco? What is this?
[2022-12-29 02:03:28] <!%Sscuzzy> i think im more wary about pixel's fucking chip
[2022-12-29 02:03:41] <%trolsopol> sscuzzy bigger but hardware is not as efficient
[2022-12-29 02:03:43] <!LinLin_nn> old chip?
[2022-12-29 02:03:54] <%trolsopol> Pixel chip is good okey
[2022-12-29 02:04:00] <!%Sscuzzy> is using the google tensor chip
[2022-12-29 02:04:07] <!LinLin_nn> oh right
[2022-12-29 02:04:15] <!LinLin_nn> instead of the usual exynos or whatever stuff
[2022-12-29 02:04:15] <!%Sscuzzy> that no one else is using so u cant really tell
[2022-12-29 02:04:25] <%trolsopol> Exynos is just samsung
[2022-12-29 02:04:34] <%trolsopol> Others are snapdragon
[2022-12-29 02:04:39] <!LinLin_nn> snapdragon thats the one
[2022-12-29 02:04:44] <!LinLin_nn> couldnt put the name on it
[2022-12-29 02:04:59] <!%Sscuzzy> SEA used to get shafted by samsung
[2022-12-29 02:05:07] <!%Sscuzzy> and is impossible
[2022-12-29 02:05:12] <%Xepionic> wdym used to
[2022-12-29 02:05:14] <!%Sscuzzy> cause they sell us exynos chips
[2022-12-29 02:05:15] <%Xepionic> they still do
[2022-12-29 02:05:21] <%trolsopol> Exynos is not bad
[2022-12-29 02:05:22] <!%Sscuzzy> not for the recent series anymore
[2022-12-29 02:05:41] <%Xepionic> they still sold it with an exynos last year pepeW
[2022-12-29 02:05:55] <!%Sscuzzy> iirc is SD here
[2022-12-29 02:06:04] <%Xepionic> i think select countries
[2022-12-29 02:06:06] <%Xepionic> are still exynos
[2022-12-29 02:06:07] <!%Sscuzzy> @trolsopol, is not bad but SD is way more efficient and
[2022-12-29 02:06:27] <%trolsopol> They are very close tbh. Um gets exynos too sometimes
[2022-12-29 02:06:27] <!%Sscuzzy> is so misleading as fuck when u watch reviews and all but u have to remember the chip is diff
[2022-12-29 02:06:30] <%trolsopol> Its weird
[2022-12-29 02:06:36] <%Xepionic> but i just use my phone for videos so
[2022-12-29 02:06:39] <%Xepionic> it doesnt really matter
[2022-12-29 02:06:52] <%trolsopol> One series is exynos the next one is SD then again exynos Shrugeg

Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask "is this ranked?", but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid frog with a megaphone instead of answering me. Fuck you, you just lost another viewer and chatter.

[2022-12-29 13:54:44] <kforkappas> It's 5pm and I just got home from work, my wife is not at home because she is staying the night over at her boyfriend's place. Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask "is this ranked?", but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid frog with a megaphone instead of answering me. Fuck you, you just lost another viewer and chatter.

Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask "is this ranked?", but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid frog with a megaphone instead of answering me. Fuck you, you just lost another viewer and chatter. PepegaPhone

[2022-12-29 20:57:09] <%RaseRasee> Is it any good? Thinkge
[2022-12-29 20:57:17] <@%AuLoen> no idea
[2022-12-29 20:57:20] <@%AuLoen> its a mod
[2022-12-29 20:57:41] <@%AuLoen> on their 1st playthrough
[2022-12-29 20:58:14] <%RaseRasee> Ah not the new DLC thingy they did the Colosseum
[2022-12-29 20:58:15] <%$Darth_Pantsu> oh its end pepeW
[2022-12-29 20:58:26] <@%AuLoen> nah
[2022-12-29 20:58:37] <%$Darth_Pantsu> how was the games with grubby Thinkge
[2022-12-29 20:58:45] <%Nutzzz96> coop is only mod
[2022-12-29 20:58:45] <%RaseRasee> Straight up co-op thru the normal game then?
[2022-12-29 20:58:47] <@%AuLoen> just a mod that make the normal playthrough to a multiplayer
[2022-12-29 20:58:55] <@%AuLoen> yea
[2022-12-29 20:58:56] <%RaseRasee> Yeah figured
[2022-12-29 20:58:58] <%RaseRasee> sounds nice
[2022-12-29 20:59:01] <%$Darth_Pantsu> fuq it VodFriends
[2022-12-29 20:59:06] <%Nutzzz96> ye its pretty thought out
[2022-12-29 20:59:07] <%RaseRasee> Might get some good laughs out of it
[2022-12-29 20:59:10] <%RaseRasee> PepeLaf
[2022-12-29 20:59:17] <%Nutzzz96> like the way they deal with people Death
[2022-12-29 20:59:21] <%RaseRasee> @Darth_Pantsu First one was really good
[2022-12-29 20:59:25] <@%AuLoen> i guess it make it easy?

[2022-12-29 20:59:29] <%RaseRasee> 2nd missed more than half of it
[2022-12-29 20:59:32] <@%AuLoen> since every boss 2v1
[2022-12-29 20:59:35] <%Nutzzz96> not too easy
[2022-12-29 20:59:39] <%$Darth_Pantsu> RaseRasee, okey
[2022-12-29 20:59:39] <%RaseRasee> Should defnitely make some bosses easier
[2022-12-29 20:59:47] <%Nutzzz96> the hps numbers are higher
[2022-12-29 20:59:49] <%RaseRasee> since you can switch aggro
[2022-12-29 20:59:59] <%Nutzzz96> and if one guy dies, the 2nd has to deal with more hp boss
[2022-12-29 21:00:09] <%RaseRasee> seems fair
[2022-12-29 21:00:19] <%Nutzzz96> it should be definitely easier
[2022-12-29 21:00:20] <@%AuLoen> maybe 1 range 1 melee tank
[2022-12-29 21:00:35] <@%AuLoen> oh wait
[2022-12-29 21:00:35] <%RaseRasee> Yeah I guess that would work out nice
[2022-12-29 21:00:41] <%Nutzzz96> but I'm not sure if they added more difficulty aspects for bosses
[2022-12-29 21:00:43] <@%AuLoen> elden ring doesnt have actual range right
[2022-12-29 21:00:53] <%RaseRasee> Can't say tbh
[2022-12-29 21:00:54] <%Nutzzz96> there's magic and crossbow
[2022-12-29 21:00:59] <%Nutzzz96> for ranged
[2022-12-29 21:01:12] <@%AuLoen> those cant shoot infinite
[2022-12-29 21:01:21] <@%AuLoen> only few shot
[2022-12-29 21:01:29] <%Nutzzz96> plenty weapon arts are decent ranged too but yea its not infinite
[2022-12-29 21:01:57] <%Nutzzz96> generally most things die within your manapool
[2022-12-29 21:02:06] <%Nutzzz96> or your build sucks cock
[2022-12-29 21:02:31] <@%AuLoen> 2 person, so no matter how sucks is the build
[2022-12-29 21:02:39] <@%AuLoen> is still have avantage
[2022-12-29 21:03:01] <%Nutzzz96> you say that but then BOGGED teammate is just gonna feed PepeLaugh
[2022-12-29 21:03:14] <%Nutzzz96> but it should be mega easy in late game Thinkge
[2022-12-29 21:03:26] <%$Darth_Pantsu> chuulstice, DinkDonk
[2022-12-29 21:03:32] <%$Darth_Pantsu> CHUU CHUU
[2022-12-29 21:03:40] <@%AuLoen> also all boss always very close to bonfire
[2022-12-29 21:03:52] <@%AuLoen> even it die also can come back fast
[2022-12-29 21:04:05] <%Nutzzz96> that doesnt work I think
[2022-12-29 21:04:12] <@%AuLoen> it doesnt?
[2022-12-29 21:04:20] <%Nutzzz96> the way they kept it is, if one guy dies, they have to wait until everyone dies
[2022-12-29 21:04:25] <%Nutzzz96> and then they can respawn
[2022-12-29 21:04:33] <@%AuLoen> oh
[2022-12-29 21:04:35] <%Nutzzz96> rykardTogethaaa
[2022-12-29 21:04:44] <@%AuLoen> will make it fair then
[2022-12-29 21:04:49] <%Nutzzz96> YEPYEP
[2022-12-29 21:07:09] <%Nutzzz96> also the part about aggro'ing 1 by 1 there are so many random bullshit attacks that you'd think are gonna hit your friend but then its you getting ANASLEKS
[2022-12-29 21:07:36] <@%AuLoen> its friendly fire?
[2022-12-29 21:08:26] <%Nutzzz96> not sure about that, I'd imagine no
[2022-12-29 21:08:31] <%Nutzzz96> or you cant use any aoe spells
