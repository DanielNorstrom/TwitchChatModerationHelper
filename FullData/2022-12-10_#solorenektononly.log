[2022-12-10 14:47:47] <+elfredopanda> Good morning Mr Baldinny
[2022-12-10 14:48:21] <%+Jhazlos> nah bro if youre not challenger its low elo
[2022-12-10 14:48:30] <%+Jhazlos> KEKO
[2022-12-10 14:48:33] <jack_the_sniper9> Low elo is gold 3 and lower
[2022-12-10 14:48:36] <%TotallyNotACopBro> pisslow KEKL
[2022-12-10 14:48:37] <%+Tabartank> gold is basically the top of low elo IMO. Mid elo starts at plat
[2022-12-10 14:48:39] <+RemarkableSeiF> id say anything below plat 2 is low elo
[2022-12-10 14:48:52] <%+Jhazlos> yo i LOVE the rune picker thing
[2022-12-10 14:48:55] <%skinnyfatbear> Low elo players are worse at the game. Crazy

[2022-12-10 14:48:59] <%TotallyNotACopBro> @Tabartank i'd agree with this

[2022-12-10 14:49:35] <+drkwhitewolf> my friends and I played against a group that felt like they had some bought accounts. We're a bunch of unranks playing a casual match and got put up against a team of Plats and managed to steam roll them.
[2022-12-10 14:49:52] <Aaahhhron> low is actually like silver and bronze.  gold and plat is med.
[2022-12-10 14:49:53] <+RemarkableSeiF> thats fine
[2022-12-10 14:49:55] <%TotallyNotACopBro> what's your definition mike Hmm

[2022-12-10 14:50:37] <%skinnyfatbear> Silver is the half way mark?! Holy

[2022-12-10 14:51:52] <%+Tabartank> but it makes sense
[2022-12-10 14:51:52] <+RemarkableSeiF> I think its better to look at the skill gap when comparing elos, not percintile
[2022-12-10 14:51:53] <%TotallyNotACopBro> money LOST

[2022-12-10 14:52:25] <%TotallyNotACopBro> i didn't fuck up my lane so i must be challenger 4Head
[2022-12-10 14:52:25] <EcchiSketchyJared> but the challenger streamers i watch tell me d2 is the same as silver
[2022-12-10 14:52:25] <pythonbeschwoerer> is there a reason that riot does not do snow maps anymore on christmas?

[2022-12-10 14:52:50] <%+Tabartank> its not a definition thing. its just how statistics work. Makes sense when its explained, but still is counter intuitive sometimes
[2022-12-10 14:52:58] <+RemarkableSeiF> @EcchiSketchyJared  Because they look at skill gap. Eventhough thats an exaggeration
[2022-12-10 14:53:12] <+camelpoggies> i  just joined and is this an attempt to counter k'sante?
