[2022-12-07 12:47:19] <FuzzleCS> most people who are lazy as fuck are unemployed plebs from nordic countries which have great welfare so they can live off of other people's tax money, they have the time to complain and be lazy
[2022-12-07 12:47:23] <impia> Well, I can't change my condition KEKW
[2022-12-07 12:47:32] <%NoWay923> Kandy is giving great advice, but this is twitch. all of us are lazy
[2022-12-07 12:47:36] <KhristophesaurusDinosarus> Oh ok yeah I don't care haha I know I'm poor because I don't work a lot KEKW

[2022-12-07 12:47:56] <%jonteno> @bluet1tan thank you
[2022-12-07 12:47:56] <Jorahldo> If you can't get a job, usually the solution is to just try to get really bad jobs

[2022-12-07 12:49:35] <olenmuna> i see two beautiful melons
[2022-12-07 12:49:37] <+dieter3000> its smart to stream instead of working a wage job :) <3 and u also worked hard on ur streams
[2022-12-07 12:49:45] <%jonteno> kandy what do you think about working a 100% yob for 18kr timmen i ett helt √•r f√∂r dem s√§tter en p√• arbetstr√§ning. och man g√∂r samma job som dem anst√§lda?... that fuckikh sucked
[2022-12-07 12:49:46] <impia> I would love to have a job within sales, but I can't really maintain it. I tried and it got so bad that my doctor had to take me out of work. Now I am just stuck at home doing nothing beside taking programming/coding course twice a week and working on my own with that
[2022-12-07 12:49:55] <+Viper_db> Then you will be successful at having easy life. I think you got the right idea
[2022-12-07 12:50:01] <%BlueT1tan> @jonteno that's a paid internship ....

[2022-12-07 12:50:56] <impia> It's not an excuse. My doctor said he had never seen anything that bad. I had 70% of my body covered in rash which made sleeping impossible, let alone work

[2022-12-07 12:51:42] <+dieter3000> what does 18kr timmen mean

[2022-12-07 12:52:11] <impia> But it doesn't apply to absolutely everyone. I've just had very bad luck in my case
[2022-12-07 12:52:28] <%NoWay923> oh no

[2022-12-07 12:53:23] <%jonteno> felt like they put me there just to get me out of the " arbetsl√∂s kategori"
[2022-12-07 12:53:26] <%NoWay923> would you pick a job you loved making minimum wage vs a job you hate making a lot of money
[2022-12-07 12:53:37] <Jorahldo> Once you get a job you'll be sad about your lack of free time and regret not making more of your unemployed time LUL
[2022-12-07 12:53:38] <%$simpX> @khristophesaurusdinosarus then what do the ppl in 3 world countries do for a living?

[2022-12-07 12:54:27] <RikkuAlBhed30> you can't survive on minimum wage, maybe in sweden it's different
