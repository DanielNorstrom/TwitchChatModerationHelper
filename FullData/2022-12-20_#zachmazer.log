[2022-12-20 10:27:56] <+gordballl> question for anyone in chat: why not just switch the CAR to light and hold all light?
[2022-12-20 10:27:58] <Nashocheese> some look better than others for sure tho
[2022-12-20 10:28:24] <lilpuffbar> @gordballl to keep track of how much ammo you have for individual guns and to keep yourself from going through it too qucikly
[2022-12-20 10:28:26] <+partypenguin24> is london or tokyo server more popular?
[2022-12-20 10:28:30] <lilpuffbar> quickly*

[2022-12-20 10:59:46] <lilpuffbar> @winkyy11 its usually preferred that you're not running two guns with the same ammo. helps you keep track of how much ammo you have left, and not go through it as fast.

[2022-12-20 13:08:35] <slackkems1738> @antotheterrifying They have never won a lane. TSM hasn’t won an ALGS since year 1. They one this one in specific but this is the first time they have one since before Snipedown. Placing high is not the same as winning. So my question still stands hown do they get back to dominating.

[2022-12-20 13:49:03] <%cactusvic> @dntp33k Right 3 stacking preds and killing diamonds doesn’t seem hard at all tbh
[2022-12-20 13:49:18] <ignore_shode> @dntp33k sounds good if they improve matchmaking
[2022-12-20 13:49:34] <%cactusvic> Especially this early with these loonies

[2022-12-20 13:50:33] <dntp33k> best soultion imo is to have a option where you can say if you prefer to wait more for a fair game,or to get a match asap
[2022-12-20 13:50:55] <%cactusvic> @bloomboy69 everytime I win and try inviting my teammates to run it back it never works out

[2022-12-20 17:49:35] <%errryberry> Nick is lowkey the main streamer I watch. I think their biggest issue is they don't really have a dedicated igl so they're all making conflicting calls. or deeds is just in complete silence
[2022-12-20 17:49:36] <cruelvenom> im making money at work

[2022-12-20 17:50:25] <+Phazed89> @errryberry I like Nick but i feel he needs to talk less during end games and let Gent IGL
[2022-12-20 17:50:38] <cruelvenom> nothing to say to that eh champ
[2022-12-20 17:50:44] <faunihuh> y r streamers so sens
[2022-12-20 17:50:47] <+Vik_Vinegar> @errryberry yeah i think they should let gent make all the calls although i know he isnt a very vocal guy. i just dont think nick is experienced enough to make calls in algs
