[2022-12-10 17:09:43] <%Alasdair> Mikka do you think it would be viable for you to watch them via the main OBS previewing to fullscreen, so you see what we see?
[2022-12-10 17:09:47] <@%xblom> they are pretty synced rn mikkaaDamn
[2022-12-10 17:09:48] <%bob_of_thunder> maybe she can evade with the controller version half paying attention while killing the dancepad version first, then when it's dead she can focus on controller boss and then victory!
[2022-12-10 17:09:49] <%OGLiquidPickle> Double horse action. Wait, that sounds bad mikkaaHide

[2022-12-10 20:50:16] <%+xavi_cash> yea you can tell youre using more brain power on dance pad
[2022-12-10 20:50:18] <@%Kano> I think the left one is the best one
[2022-12-10 20:50:23] <VagabondJC> isnt it just like 2? horrah lou (or how ever its spelled) and this guy? lol
[2022-12-10 20:50:23] <!%bmap72> you usually survive longer and do more damage
[2022-12-10 20:50:26] <!%bmap72> unless you fall
[2022-12-10 20:50:27] <@%Kano> Kappa

[2022-12-10 20:53:29] <dmwtopshotta> is that appropriate to wear
[2022-12-10 20:53:39] <%RegentOfOrigin> technically fire giant has gravity
[2022-12-10 20:53:50] <!%bmap72> @xblom I think his arena is much larger but there are cliffs at the edge
[2022-12-10 20:53:52] <Turstlye> wat i just saw one of your emote somewhere else and was curious , did not expect that
[2022-12-10 20:53:52] <$fallout7295> ok @ahalle95

[2022-12-10 21:14:27] <%Lionhart> It'll definitely get easier! I had a similar issue when I had to learn to type two different sentences at once (one with each hand). I genuinely don't think I could ever be able to do the challenge you're doing now though!
[2022-12-10 21:14:50] <@%Kano> please no
[2022-12-10 21:14:50] <yawntoe> valiant effort

[2022-12-10 21:39:29] <@%^y0shi_b0t> The Imperial guards are still on high alert and a heist now would be foolish. Give it another 39 minutes 59 seconds and try again.
[2022-12-10 21:39:29] <+Immortal_216> I'm wondering if you're paying more attention to the dance pad just because it's the more complicated control scheme and that's why you get hit more on the controller.

[2022-12-10 21:41:17] <%Hodor0817> I mean she also played a lot on the dance pad recently, so might be muscle memory is better with it now than with the controller, or it might be because it's involving moving the legs and feet and not only the fingers apolThink but no idea tbh, we gotta hook mikkaa up to a brainwave machine thingy mikkaaMlem
[2022-12-10 21:41:18] <+zambonien> xblom everything is 50/50 :p even if you farm for a special item in a dropchance, no matter what game devs say the % is, its still 50/50 :P
