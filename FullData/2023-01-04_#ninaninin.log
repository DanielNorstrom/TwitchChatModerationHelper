[2023-01-04 21:21:56] <%Ninas_neeners> I'd just settle for an original fantasy world
[2023-01-04 21:21:58] <%isakcoffee> That's why KonoSuba is good. Make the protag a sleezy scumbag that suffers
[2023-01-04 21:21:59] <%Utsurosu> Honestly, in isekai manga I do be liking my yakuza reincarnator or kage no jitsu nininSip

[2023-01-04 21:22:39] <thebadger404> I hate how everyone says the new boring Isekai is actuall cool and subversive or whatever
[2023-01-04 21:22:41] <RavenSuzumiya> did you watch "the executioner and her way of life"?
[2023-01-04 21:22:42] <!%tatsunical> party wipes are so good!!!
[2023-01-04 21:22:44] <Gdammit> I like The Eminence in Shadow, it's pretty self-aware for an isekai
[2023-01-04 21:22:45] <%CrungeRiver> Grimgar more like Grimdark lmao
[2023-01-04 21:22:45] <BranflakesinWater> about a week ago all my bookmarks reverted to like a month ago, so bookmarks i deleted came back and the ones i moved around went back to where they were before.

[2023-01-04 21:23:29] <thegreatmike101> is there an Isekai where the MC is transported FROM a magical world INTO our boring one?
[2023-01-04 21:23:31] <%RGBHD> Last anime I actually liked the story of was Goblin Slayer
