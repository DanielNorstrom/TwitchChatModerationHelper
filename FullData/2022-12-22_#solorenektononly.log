[2022-12-22 16:13:58] <%$yungshibe> When both teams are even in gold, my bot feels that it is at a great advantage and thus does not hesitate to start a team fight. When bot is 3k behind in gold, bot thinks that it is at a small advantage, and so it starts a team fight to secure their "lead". When bot is behind 7k in gold, bot thinks that it is at a disadvantage and so it looks for a team fight to regain control of the game. When bot is 10K behind in gold, bot thinks that the team has reached a desperate situation and they fight.

[2022-12-22 16:47:57] <SuperSmashBroski> it's hard to explain it all in a twitch chat, but for the most part, all of it. Food you eat daily is fortified in maco/micro nutrients making multis a waste and if you aren't on a heavy caloric deficit - protein isn't needed etc

[2022-12-22 16:51:40] <+jaketw562> The argument is purely based on the person's diet. If you get all your nutrients from food and you aren't deficient, then no supplements needed. But for most people, that's not realistic.

[2022-12-22 16:54:19] <+jaketw562> It is also much easier for your body to absorb high concentrations of nutrients in supplements. Many people who are iron deficient anemic just cannot absorb enough iron from meat. Supplements have a much higher concentration and are more easily absorbed.

[2022-12-22 17:01:41] <Skoplio> Honestly, the biggest challenge to fighting ranged top is staying awake
[2022-12-22 17:01:44] <%the_misanthrope13> is your team so gapped with 10 kill difference cmonBruh
[2022-12-22 17:01:50] <%+crocsftw> Sux to play against this, but fun to watch!
[2022-12-22 17:01:56] <+c20h25n3o_is_fun> Who the fuck voted no, the point of the game is for a video
