[2022-12-19 15:05:14] <Trigawastaken> You can max a tree without swiping
[2022-12-19 15:05:21] <Trigawastaken> It just takes time and ambition LUL
[2022-12-19 15:05:41] <+Zacpac> @cookiezxy Dont needa play meta mate... i play fire stick and that shit is ass right now
[2022-12-19 15:05:45] <Trigawastaken> 700 on a tree is actually quite fast
[2022-12-19 15:05:58] <cookiezxy> but if i fame farm is better to use what i want to spec up or to use what i have 100 spec and use credit fame
[2022-12-19 15:06:01] <%CelicaArfonia> 110-120k favor = if u buy full chest min 6.5m-7.0m fame you got

[2022-12-19 15:06:53] <%CelicaArfonia> Sorry i typed wrong 110-120k favor = if u buy full chest min 6.5m-7.0m silver you got
[2022-12-19 15:07:32] <+Zacpac> @CelicaArfonia Can just buy tomes for fame hehe
[2022-12-19 15:07:38] <Trigawastaken> @RumpleStiltskin_DaiN for example faction warfare, the amount of tomes out of chests is insane. Or you just do any other content. But if you do dungeon fame farm it will probably get expensive because you need auto-respec. You dont need that when you use tomes
[2022-12-19 15:07:51] <%CelicaArfonia> @CelicaArfonia yeah yeah i typed wrong first

[2022-12-19 15:08:04] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken Only issue with faction warfare is finding a good group to run it all with

[2022-12-19 15:09:27] <+Zacpac> Soo whats the best way to farm points?
[2022-12-19 15:09:27] <Trigawastaken> I wish they rework faction now, points have been nerfed hard
[2022-12-19 15:09:36] <RedMaxKing> beast is turning to gega rat rn xD jk
[2022-12-19 15:09:43] <Trigawastaken> when faction was the buffed event ingame I easily made 500k faction points an evening
[2022-12-19 15:09:47] <Trigawastaken> wich is a lot of fame
[2022-12-19 15:09:58] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken Just by capping things?
[2022-12-19 15:10:01] <Trigawastaken> Cap outposts in small grps
[2022-12-19 15:10:02] <Trigawastaken> yes
[2022-12-19 15:10:04] <Trigawastaken> and pve sets
[2022-12-19 15:10:09] <Trigawastaken> But now you need huge fights
[2022-12-19 15:10:15] <Trigawastaken> they nerfed pve in faction and buffed pvp
[2022-12-19 15:10:15] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken and i have 550k faction points rn but apparently 1 weapon from 0-100 is 1.2m faction points

[2022-12-19 15:11:13] <+luisasdw> now healer
[2022-12-19 15:11:19] <Trigawastaken> So also, regarding faction, you will actually save money because you dont need to use auto-respec right? Caus you can put tomes on any build you want
[2022-12-19 15:11:25] <@Garahaith> PogChamp
[2022-12-19 15:11:27] <Trigawastaken> Thats a good upside I think, specially for new players

[2022-12-19 15:11:42] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken Yes its good for new players
[2022-12-19 15:11:54] <+Zacpac> but you need to find a good group and get good standing in a faction
[2022-12-19 15:12:03] <+Zacpac> thats my issue rught now
[2022-12-19 15:12:15] <+Zacpac> i have ok standing but the group i have been running with is shit no lie
[2022-12-19 15:12:24] <Trigawastaken> @Zacpac That doesnt sound too bad, ive been very active on 1 faction event with 20 % bonus and I did like 2 mil points in 3 days and got 600k extra just on the weekly reset
[2022-12-19 15:12:40] <Trigawastaken> Ye true, im glad i joined BW
[2022-12-19 15:12:40] <+Zacpac> WEll my 550k points has been like 3 weeks

[2022-12-19 15:13:04] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken Like is there a kapping group going all day?
[2022-12-19 15:13:19] <Trigawastaken> @Zacpac almost at any time of the day yes
[2022-12-19 15:13:26] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken How big is the group?
[2022-12-19 15:13:38] <Trigawastaken> Atm there are 55 ppl in coms for the end of bandit
[2022-12-19 15:13:48] <Trigawastaken> 46*
[2022-12-19 15:13:49] <+Zacpac> @Trigawastaken I mean just suual cap
[2022-12-19 15:13:57] <+Zacpac> because i wanna get the big points by capoping
[2022-12-19 15:14:05] <Trigawastaken> Ppl ping for normal caps like every 2 hours at least, when points are big
[2022-12-19 15:14:19] <Trigawastaken> Sometimes they go pvp with pve swaps, sometimes pure pve
[2022-12-19 15:14:35] <+Zacpac> idk i just really wanna get about 10m points soo i can juice a tree then stop playing faction for a while xD
[2022-12-19 15:14:41] <Trigawastaken> But since points got nerfed i mostplay play bandits and look for pvp
[2022-12-19 15:15:07] <Trigawastaken> @Zacpac you can also just take a weapon you like and play it open world or in mists, its not too bad fame

[2022-12-19 15:27:33] <yonipoka69> new to this game any tips already have T5 gear but still struggling
[2022-12-19 15:27:38] <Trigawastaken> I think the fact that people like me actually dont enjoy so many weapons (like deathgivers for example) actually speaks for itself. The weapons in the game have different taste and thats super cool
[2022-12-19 15:28:08] <shamado33> how you go in safe city in mist?

[2022-12-19 15:28:48] <@^StreamElements> "The new city Brecilien is accessed by gaining 50k rep in the mist. After that you have too find the entrance in a mist zone. (look for a mushroom circle)" Here you are.
[2022-12-19 15:29:04] <%zr08> @shamado33 search up how to get to brecilien
[2022-12-19 15:29:18] <Trigawastaken> I dont understand why ppl come in a channel like this with obvious questions they could just rather google or youtube it LUL
[2022-12-19 15:29:21] <Trigawastaken> its faster for everyone
[2022-12-19 15:29:44] <%zr08> or actually ill explain it u need 50k then u can either tp to it or go in an uncommon or higher mist and theres a 10% chance of the portal spawning
[2022-12-19 15:29:59] <%xxxTotemFuryxxx> Morning
[2022-12-19 15:30:08] <%zr08> @Trigawastaken some pplz are new and want information from ppl cuz tjeu get extra info sometimes
