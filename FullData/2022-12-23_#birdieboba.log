[2022-12-23 04:24:44] <@%kdlutz> @Cocobutterpanda thats so awesome! i think my favourite variety of death metal is the 90's swedish melodeath type sound (it's kind of a particular sound and guitar tone, but its bands like At The Gates, Entombed, Gluttony, etc.)
[2022-12-23 04:24:50] <@%kdlutz> but glad you liking it

[2022-12-23 04:25:48] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/

[2022-12-23 04:33:49] <@%kdlutz> @Cocobutterpanda dude its such a good fucking feeling. Try to get into sweeps asap as there are some very common shapes you can apply across a few different scales easily, then u only gotta learn those few shapes and already you have big access to shredding

[2022-12-23 04:35:31] <!%Cocobutterpanda> @kdlutz I’m assuming learning to shred is gonna be the same feeling as learning to kick flip lol.

[2022-12-23 05:14:44] <@%^Streamlabs> Tengu are a type of legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. They are a type of mischievous supernatural being. They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.

[2022-12-23 06:08:38] <%oD_Static> oh, i mean the brand is "AK Racing". Herman Miller has "gaming versions" of normal chairs. they cost like 100-200€ more for some undiscernable reason
