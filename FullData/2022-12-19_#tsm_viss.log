[2022-12-19 17:44:25] <%+CoachMulvi> Taq 56?
[2022-12-19 17:44:25] <%sinisterriffle> my personal favorite is the taq 56. you can build that gun out real good for mid range.
[2022-12-19 17:44:31] <%+dawnofthedave387> you mean the Taq 56?
[2022-12-19 17:44:54] <%+natedk85> @shermanjames it's basically the SCAR with a larger 7.62 round.  it has high DPS, but like the rest of the assault rifles, it's damage at ranges falls off... so it's not great for WZ where the ranges are longer.
[2022-12-19 17:45:16] <haluni97> @spammusubiii thx dude haha
[2022-12-19 17:45:22] <ShermanJames> Most likely. My bad guys. Thanks lol

[2022-12-19 21:20:13] <JuicyTurkeyTV> I just wish they’d remove 2v2 gulag altogether. 1v1 gulag was far superior IMO

[2022-12-19 21:22:16] <%nasbuckeyes> 2v2 is a cool concept if you go in with your teammate....2v2 gulag with a random is awful

[2022-12-19 21:24:22] <%+Purplesmurf24> unpopular opinion but I think all Gulags should be 1v1 and thats the only chance you get to be respawned. No buying in teammates if they lost etc. You die and lose gulag, you spectating now boy

[2022-12-19 21:25:30] <%nasbuckeyes> Yeah @Purplesmurf24 I tend to agree with you, however, I would like to see a timer like Apex or Fortnite as far as buying back teammates. You should have to get their "ID Tags" to be able to res them but they are only available for a couple minutes
