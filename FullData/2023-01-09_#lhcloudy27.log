[2023-01-09 18:03:12] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side
[2023-01-09 18:03:18] <thefancysock> nice necklace :)

[2023-01-09 18:40:11] <GIRLinMaleBody> @ItsSevenD then ur pins would just miss

[2023-01-09 19:24:59] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side

[2023-01-09 19:45:22] <kaymaroarts> dps moiras are better that 90% of mercy mains, no cap
[2023-01-09 19:45:43] <GIRLinMaleBody> mercy forgives so many mistakes, she is op to pocket ur dps
[2023-01-09 19:45:55] <kaymaroarts> Yes

[2023-01-09 19:46:30] <%WinstonsNK> @FlaccidSssnake a certain type of ana cannot help jump on the payload in a big melee and die
[2023-01-09 19:46:31] <GIRLinMaleBody> dps moiras dont play frontline, theyre flanking the backline

He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2023-01-09 22:26:00] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side
