[2022-12-30 13:37:19] <realbgz10> Because they haven't been in Ucl in 6 years
[2022-12-30 13:37:20] <+I_am_Gretts> Has team 2 been leaked other than the one player?
[2022-12-30 13:37:30] <$antman372> 600 mill in 6 months and they‚Äôre still shit
[2022-12-30 13:37:37] <+thewalshman> Remember when Arsenal tried to furlough gunnersarus and Ozil stepped in to pay his wages LUL
[2022-12-30 13:37:42] <arminatorrrrr> its good to see Arsenal back, if only Milan and Inter can get back
[2022-12-30 13:37:43] <matt__jame2> @i_am_gretts gabriel Jesus is leaked to come also
[2022-12-30 13:37:44] <+tenma_1019> @I_am_Gretts sii

[2022-12-30 13:37:51] <futassassin> lets go nep
[2022-12-30 13:38:02] <$antman372> No?
[2022-12-30 13:38:05] <fodinho97> Arsenal are hilarious because they have the most expensive season tickets in Europe and haven‚Äôt won the league in 20 years
[2022-12-30 13:38:06] <sterudd123> Big factor
[2022-12-30 13:38:10] <jo3r100> Money helps tho
[2022-12-30 13:38:10] <dangoodwin1> Do you think Arsenal just have a different belief to previous years, they look really solid this year?
[2022-12-30 13:38:10] <SHANEALEX91> look at United man my team has spend so much and we're awful
[2022-12-30 13:38:10] <$antman372> Look at brighton

[2022-12-30 13:38:14] <dean71888> Well money is the biggest factor yeah
[2022-12-30 13:38:15] <$antman372> Insane recruitment
[2022-12-30 13:38:17] <@%Witchwalker70> I have a few ligamx players, looking forward to it starting
[2022-12-30 13:38:19] <NYKANILMAGICIAN20> hi nep how are you

[2022-12-30 13:38:29] <fisa42> Nep do you still talk to skillz?
[2022-12-30 13:38:31] <newgillette> Is it just me or servers are so bad and game works so slow??? @NepentheZ
[2022-12-30 13:38:33] <matt__jame2> If money is everything in football why have psg not won a champions league yet?
[2022-12-30 13:38:40] <$antman372> Boehly just signing players for the sake of signing players
[2022-12-30 13:38:41] <arminatorrrrr> money is a big key now in football its 80% money these days
[2022-12-30 13:38:43] <zeeboogie10> What you munching on neppo
[2022-12-30 13:38:43] <prottogt> How much MS r u playing on nep ?
[2022-12-30 13:38:56] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> it took arsenal awhile to gel to arteta
[2022-12-30 13:39:00] <+RyanMM97> How many daily logins should we have completed?
[2022-12-30 13:39:05] <$darwinswift> 6 points off 4th with a game In hand hardly bad after all the takeover an manager changes
[2022-12-30 13:39:12] <+Kiittsy> Arsenal have had half a good season
[2022-12-30 13:39:14] <realbgz10> Shows there not even a top 4 club
[2022-12-30 13:39:16] <fodinho97> It‚Äôs like saying your good at fifa but can‚Äôt qualify for fut champs
[2022-12-30 13:39:23] <%+Kieran96cfc> Arsenal are proof you have to give a manager time instead of sacking them every year
[2022-12-30 13:39:24] <%+nickblandmcfc> as a city fan im dreading the arsenal game
[2022-12-30 13:39:40] <JxPell> If i already have a decent team is it worth spending 5 mil on 94 r9? (he would be replacing rulebreakers r7) or spread coins out on 3 players.
[2022-12-30 13:39:42] <%+Kieran96cfc> Arsenal are literally a top 4 club right now aswell
[2022-12-30 13:39:43] <schefeyyy> lol
[2022-12-30 13:39:56] <JSiggy> Arsenal are actually the top club
[2022-12-30 13:39:57] <arminatorrrrr> arsenal was always in top 4
[2022-12-30 13:39:58] <JSiggy> COYG
[2022-12-30 13:39:59] <+banco_billy> Arsenal we‚Äôre the top four club!
[2022-12-30 13:40:00] <JammieDodge191> @nickblandmcfc we have to beat you at home if we have any chance of the league nothing for you to worry about

[2022-12-30 13:40:39] <%+nickblandmcfc> @JammieDodge191 yeah but we've been a bit shaky recently i.e brentford

[2022-12-30 13:40:56] <+thewalshman> I‚Äôm not convinced with City either

[2022-12-30 13:41:23] <%+athwalas> Arsenal are building a good young squad
[2022-12-30 13:41:25] <%+mikekozy23> is this still the 4 day rtg
[2022-12-30 13:41:26] <here4rewards_> United have been awful since SAF left, so sad for me
[2022-12-30 13:41:26] <$antman372> What happened to smith rowe thought he was supposed to be back by now
[2022-12-30 13:41:27] <$Navi_gate> Everyone is ether in div 1 or div 6
[2022-12-30 13:41:28] <SHANEALEX91> Arsenal being 5 points ahead of city is massive.
[2022-12-30 13:41:33] <+james_thomas565> What do you think has changed to this season then?
[2022-12-30 13:41:34] <kaskadior> we suffered much in this 5-6 years
[2022-12-30 13:41:38] <primejbf> Have u lost yet?
[2022-12-30 13:41:44] <bols87> Is baby maldini good?
[2022-12-30 13:41:48] <xgreatedi> Chelsea ?
[2022-12-30 13:41:55] <%+nickblandmcfc> @JammieDodge191 i think jesus being out could cost you a few points
[2022-12-30 13:41:56] <fungafufu> if arsenal can stay fit until the end, i say they win it
[2022-12-30 13:41:57] <%+Kieran96cfc> Chelsea wont be LUL
[2022-12-30 13:42:03] <schefeyyy> does arsenal have the funds to compete with city and newcastle?
[2022-12-30 13:42:04] <realbgz10> You played
[2022-12-30 13:42:04] <%grrimez> Saka is HIM
[2022-12-30 13:42:07] <xjmb1996> Arsenal look great this year. I‚Äôm a Man U fan and arsenal could of got the win but I think arteta went all out attack and we took advantage of that. Excited to see what happens. I like arsenal even though I don‚Äôt support them. Hope Utd can get top 4 this season and start challenging again
[2022-12-30 13:42:08] <arminatorrrrr> what do u think nep, what player do Arsenal need, cb cm st ?
[2022-12-30 13:42:09] <+JakFrain> man united? we're lookin better?
[2022-12-30 13:42:09] <here4rewards_> Maybe chelsea in 2-3 years time
[2022-12-30 13:42:16] <+thewalshman> Arsenal need to hit 90 points first to even be considered
[2022-12-30 13:42:18] <@sorarejosh> it took us so long to get rid of the dead wood players
[2022-12-30 13:42:18] <+MackTominay> Chelsea get enzo, they‚Äôre a different team, already secured nkunku
[2022-12-30 13:42:19] <%+dtf1325> remember last season when the toon were bottom lol. now 3rd . a lot can happen. and we aint even splashed the cash
[2022-12-30 13:42:21] <derdreckigedan> Why is the music so loud lol
[2022-12-30 13:42:22] <%+brendanmcd8> arsenal just need a bit of depth to me - theyv'e got a few positions with a lot of "key man risk"
[2022-12-30 13:42:22] VIEWERS: 1¬†210
[2022-12-30 13:42:23] <%+idontroam> I¬¥d compare this Arsenal with the first season Liverpool challenged City in 2019
[2022-12-30 13:42:24] <$antman372> Only hole in arsenals team rn is Gabriel and even still he‚Äôs pretty good
[2022-12-30 13:42:24] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> i think arsenal are missing a leader
[2022-12-30 13:42:25] <+backwardz__> @bols87 not bad, low on agression lets him down a bit
[2022-12-30 13:42:28] <kaskadior> it looks like kroenkes are backing arteta
[2022-12-30 13:42:30] <+sealdawg> Feel Arsenal need  5-6 more players to compete, esp when they get champs league
[2022-12-30 13:42:31] <+thewalshman> Chelsea will turn Enzo into Jorginho
[2022-12-30 13:42:34] <+titch927> league sbc so cheap right now
[2022-12-30 13:42:38] <arminatorrrrr> what do u think nep, what player do Arsenal need, midfield, strikers wingers fullbacks?

[2022-12-30 13:42:41] <%+tobywankenobi101> experience will be the big factor for you, whether you can keep it going or like in the last few seasons you drop points in the games you should be winning
[2022-12-30 13:42:41] <%+jamespike> you do realise that man utd are being bought in the first quarter of 2023. With ten haag in charge, you'd be silly to count them out.
[2022-12-30 13:42:43] <JammieDodge191> @nickblandmcfc yeah I think so too, hence we need to strengthen or else Thursday-Sunday fixtures will kill our challenge
[2022-12-30 13:42:44] <%+Kieran96cfc> does he even play for his new club now?
[2022-12-30 13:42:46] <CactusJoee> how do u green time finesse goals?
[2022-12-30 13:42:46] <nc_99> Arsenal about to play UCL next year, no doubt of that. 10 points clear of the 4th position right now
[2022-12-30 13:42:48] <arminatorrrrr> what do u think nep, what player do Arsenal need, midfield, strikers wingers fullbacks??
[2022-12-30 13:42:55] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> we at united have loads of dead wood

[2022-12-30 13:43:04] <mickao7> Chat I‚Äôve been playing this fifa for like 2-3 weeks and don‚Äôt like the gameplay. My team feels slow and heavy, with the opponent been way faster. Any tips

[2022-12-30 13:43:07] <finoallafineforzajuve> Now we have been stuck with Ramsey and his massive salery
[2022-12-30 13:43:08] <realbgz10> You will see when you play the Citys and Newcastles you will fold you lot already folded to United
[2022-12-30 13:43:11] <%+nickblandmcfc> how long is jesus out for?
[2022-12-30 13:43:18] <ajohno28> David luiz
[2022-12-30 13:43:19] <fungafufu> tbh arteta done a great job
[2022-12-30 13:43:20] <+MackTominay> Chelsea already having nkunku and looking good for enzo could be scary
[2022-12-30 13:43:21] <+jsarrami> you think Newcastle will be consistent up there from now??
[2022-12-30 13:43:36] <+jrossino> Haven‚Äôt we lost like one game lmao

[2022-12-30 13:44:09] <realbgz10> What im saying is arsenal are not all that

[2022-12-30 13:44:28] <arminatorrrrr> its better to lose at start of the season then in the end
[2022-12-30 13:44:32] <+jtsnipe7> personally thought United deserved that win. Arteta has got your team playing well above expectations this season
[2022-12-30 13:44:33] <JammieDodge191> @leavesley999 you lot are great atm. We will struggle at your place
[2022-12-30 13:44:33] <%+chriscfcwooooo> I completely thought Liverpool would steam roll arsenal but got to say i was beyond impressed with arsenal
[2022-12-30 13:44:35] <$Navi_gate> Man U won while lengthy was still meta ten gag had rash Ford with an architect
[2022-12-30 13:44:36] <RamiboooiPlays> its insane

[2022-12-30 13:44:55] <adamkelly1304> i deffo think arsenal will win the league, in my brain it'll go 1) arsenal 2) man city 3) newcastle 4) liverpool 5) spurs
[2022-12-30 13:44:56] <%+nickblandmcfc> @htsolna08 not  yet
[2022-12-30 13:45:06] <+keidisfg44> you probs aint beating liverpool at home
[2022-12-30 13:45:08] <SHANEALEX91> was at the United and Arsenal game. Arsenal played better and deserved something from the game
[2022-12-30 13:45:08] <%+curtismosley1> Still got 2 games against city, think that will tell who‚Äôs going to win the league
[2022-12-30 13:45:09] <xjmb1996> Utd just took advantage of arteta going all out after we got the equaliser and managed to counter. Arsenal look great apart from that and I‚Äôm a Man U supporter. My best friend supports arsenal too and it‚Äôs good to talk to him about how they are doing well under arteta because he‚Äôs been given time
[2022-12-30 13:45:09] <%+Kieran96cfc> Brentford also beat Man city

[2022-12-30 13:45:13] <$Navi_gate> I cant ser city winning comfortably however it‚Äôs gonna be a good game honestly
[2022-12-30 13:45:16] <$antman372> City had some dumb losses too
[2022-12-30 13:45:17] <+TimmyLH44> Spurs are in that position arsenal were in we have so much deadwood that needs to go
[2022-12-30 13:45:19] <cm301998> Do you think you will go out and try sign another striker in jan? Considering jesus is injured
[2022-12-30 13:45:22] <%+GKBHAFC> Looking forward to our game tomorrow Nep. Should be a really interesting matchup
[2022-12-30 13:45:29] <fodinho97> Don‚Äôt think your maths is correct Nep
[2022-12-30 13:45:34] <+h_b_b00> city is to strong imo, city will win both games vs arsenal cuz off the depth in the squad
[2022-12-30 13:45:36] <+smokeymcpot_99> Arsenal will struggle against Brighton tomorrow imo
[2022-12-30 13:45:37] <mikem106> As a Newcastle fan, it‚Äôs nice hearing us being spoke about like a true top 4 contender ü§™
[2022-12-30 13:45:40] <LawsonJP> not that hard to beat Liverpool this season unfortunately ü•≤
[2022-12-30 13:45:44] <fodinho97> City beat you twice thats 6 points
[2022-12-30 13:45:48] <+smokeymcpot_99> Norwich are in the championship LUL
[2022-12-30 13:45:49] <Zecka201> that happens in Portugal all the time, big teams lose against each other and the most consistent against the "smaller" teams is the champion
[2022-12-30 13:45:51] <%+GKBHAFC> @smokeymcpot_99 We're missing both Mac Allister and Caicedo tomorrow
[2022-12-30 13:45:52] <%+tobywankenobi101> Do you think you'll win or still think Cuty are the faves?
[2022-12-30 13:45:52] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> if u are top at new year then u are the best in league u deserve to be there no ifs or buts
[2022-12-30 13:45:58] <itsRamzilla> be hard to lose against Norwich with them being in a different league LUL
[2022-12-30 13:45:59] <+tenma_1019> i hear u
[2022-12-30 13:45:59] <+0libyr> that logic flawed vs this city team

[2022-12-30 13:46:02] <james_spruce> Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll lose to Norwich

[2022-12-30 13:51:55] <$antman372> Newcastle getting Bruno g completely changed them aswell
[2022-12-30 13:51:56] <%+jordy061> he was mint at arsenal
[2022-12-30 13:52:01] <soapysoutar04> do u think Gakpo will be a success at Liverpool?

[2022-12-30 13:52:04] <+jtsnipe7> average player with pace. Slightly better Dan James üòâ
[2022-12-30 13:52:05] <tbwinsx> you‚Äôre forgetting him at southampton
[2022-12-30 13:52:06] <%+mykill91> rashford is probably not far of 108
[2022-12-30 13:52:07] <meadenharley_> he's at Southampton

[2022-12-30 13:52:20] <+MackTominay> Theo Walcott is a McTominay wannabe
[2022-12-30 13:52:21] <samjh43> Nep do you think arsenal need a new striker. As a leeds fan Eddie was always inconsistent and scored in patches

[2022-12-30 13:52:30] <here4rewards_> Rashford has elite ball striking and La pausa
[2022-12-30 13:52:31] <thewalsallswift> he burst onto the scene aged 16 didnt he at Southampton

[2022-12-30 13:53:07] <notlaw__> A fully fit martial bags goals
[2022-12-30 13:53:09] <hoodiemelou> did walcott play up top for arsenal
[2022-12-30 13:53:09] <mh200510> walcott a winger tbf
[2022-12-30 13:53:12] <%+MassiveBanna> I said Marcus Nep not Martial
[2022-12-30 13:53:13] <%+brendanmcd8> Walcott's biggest problem was that expectations/hype were too high for him to be great when he was "just" a very good player at his peak - so in an odd way it makes him feel like a failure to people
[2022-12-30 13:53:15] <lpd1996> Walcott was hot stuff when he burst onto the scene, just never pushed on and lived up to his full potential and injuries hurt him late on
[2022-12-30 13:53:16] <$jamiedarragh> What about dele alli nep?
[2022-12-30 13:53:16] <badr_4321> agree

[2022-12-30 13:53:44] <%+sams1995> That‚Äôs what separates the good players from the great players

[2022-12-30 13:53:57] <+smokeymcpot_99> Probably not cos he‚Äôll pick up injuries

[2022-12-30 13:54:14] <%+sheriffshinetop> We're all fucked on FIFA if Martial hits the heights again
[2022-12-30 13:54:14] <@sorarejosh> best of luck
[2022-12-30 13:54:16] <+fawkes6191> The lack of work rate that Ronaldo talks about   Is what‚Äôs holding martial back I think..
[2022-12-30 13:54:17] <+jamietwitch_> Martial never performs when he has competition, I.e. zlatan, Ronaldo

[2022-12-30 14:49:12] <%+jsh66> I've started using player lock a lot more,creates different angles and actually makes people have to defend
[2022-12-30 14:49:18] <%+LukeO94> If you jockey with your CBs 9/10 you already have defended poorly. Best thing I've learnt this year is the LB and RB dribbling
[2022-12-30 14:49:26] <archermelvo> in pro clubs it is so hard to get past the ai defence if you don't have momentum

Even at +1 or +2 I face teams with Al Owairan, Mbapp√© (mostly special) and more high end meta Icons and special cards and every opponent plays like at least DIV 3.

[2022-12-30 15:11:19] <+Josh3004> not toxic imo, he skipped because now bcz he hasn't got to thank u now
[2022-12-30 15:11:19] <+hiberrry_> so of course he'll skip

[2022-12-30 15:11:33] <%$liamfifa91> The best thank you is to not celebrate at all. Just take your win and move on
[2022-12-30 15:11:33] <%+tobywankenobi101> I've had people message a heart when they get a free win, after they skip celebration. not hard to do
[2022-12-30 15:11:35] <+TheGreenePotato> only reason he cele'd first is to thabk you, so then he skipped I'd say
[2022-12-30 15:11:35] <%+jsh66> @connorrm14 Same
[2022-12-30 15:11:36] <+ruftkut04> dont get your logic

[2022-12-30 15:11:41] <%KC_Runz> Thats always my thoughts, if you want to say thanks simply message, ANY custom cele is only ever meant as toxic
[2022-12-30 15:11:42] <+GJXRV> nep youre wrong pal
[2022-12-30 15:11:43] <Post_FUT_Clarity> genuinely a thank you celly
[2022-12-30 15:11:43] <lpd1996> like that celebration is mesnt to be a player showing respect and not celebrating against an old team or something but why not just skip then
[2022-12-30 15:11:45] <+SMSDXB> it is a thank you here.. at least in my circle
[2022-12-30 15:11:49] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> the sory celebration dosent mean thank you, why would the other dude be sory?

[2022-12-30 15:12:04] <barneywilson1> didn‚Äôt he make a sub when he paused?
[2022-12-30 15:12:06] <+dacosta120589> Bro stop being petty and just rise above these fools stop caring man seriously
[2022-12-30 15:12:07] <+krock44457> narcissistic and petty
[2022-12-30 15:12:14] <%+Jabbaland> celebration is never a thank you. A message is after the game.
[2022-12-30 15:12:17] <+OdiammoTutti> I mean he‚Äôs clearly better than you
[2022-12-30 15:12:18] <grenadier2> people criticizing clearly haven't read the Toxicity Handbook pugzFINE
[2022-12-30 15:12:19] <Post_FUT_Clarity> I am sorry Nep but you're wrong here
[2022-12-30 15:12:19] <choppazzzz> looking for trouble
[2022-12-30 15:12:19] <gazcarcan> I personally don't believe the apologise celebration to be toxic
[2022-12-30 15:12:21] <+football_fifa_fut> You instantly he assumed he was toxic let‚Äôs be real
[2022-12-30 15:12:23] <flexwheezy> LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-30 15:12:23] <+SMSDXB> its not toxic in my opinion
[2022-12-30 15:12:24] <lionel_the_one> this is one of thoese rare cases you're in the wrong @NepentheZ
[2022-12-30 15:12:24] <+TurtlesHeadsPopinOut> afternoon Nep and chatters
[2022-12-30 15:12:25] <hammerswhu> you're wrong nep haha
[2022-12-30 15:12:26] <%+DirtyDishFC> You sure it isnt the fact the Fifa community is toxic and so it impacts your rationale here? I didnt know that celebration is toxic till you said something
[2022-12-30 15:12:26] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think the ‚Äúthanks‚Äù cele and then skip makes sense. Thanks for the free win. Then when he isn‚Äôt getting the free win he doesn‚Äôt cele. That to me is the least toxic way of doing a cele imo
[2022-12-30 15:12:28] <beans6904> I agree with you nep like just get your win and move on
[2022-12-30 15:12:29] <%+riff_hunter44> Saying TY
[2022-12-30 15:12:32] <flexwheezy> it wasnt toxic
[2022-12-30 15:12:32] <+banco_billy> You have to rise above toxic people, not join them.
[2022-12-30 15:12:32] <rdd020> Chil man is een game
[2022-12-30 15:12:32] <+dacosta120589> Who cares just rise above it and carry on
[2022-12-30 15:12:32] <barneywilson1> I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs toxic.
[2022-12-30 15:12:34] <%+always_rainy98> not sure its toxic, i use it to be nice to people
[2022-12-30 15:12:35] <%+brendanmcd8> if the cele was a "thank you" you can skip half way through
[2022-12-30 15:12:35] <+sergibonga> People do the sorry celebration when they score a shit goal against me which I don‚Äôt consider toxic
[2022-12-30 15:12:36] <hashtag_mizo> drama
[2022-12-30 15:12:37] <+thokiee> Just be easier to leave at 0-0 in all games you plan to give away. Avoids all of this and rarely anyone else gives free wins so f everyone else
[2022-12-30 15:12:39] <$jamiedarragh> nahhhh its not toxic though nep honestly
[2022-12-30 15:12:41] <boatacus> thats the least toxic celeb in the game
[2022-12-30 15:12:43] <xyr01337> do you now when pope gets to a 88 rated
[2022-12-30 15:12:43] <pecticjr> if he wants to thank you for the win would he of thanked after the game instead of expecting a free win
[2022-12-30 15:12:44] <+berryjamie1> 75% of chat says your in the wrong Nep ü§°ü§°ü§°
[2022-12-30 15:12:44] <+TheGreenePotato> @spreadsheetfifa agree
[2022-12-30 15:12:44] <+philipio1> I‚Äôm with Nep. Nothing is more toxic than when the other guy does a full celebration and then pauses for you
[2022-12-30 15:12:45] <%divkush> what is meant by "custom" cele?
[2022-12-30 15:12:45] <$yayatoure12399> even josh said it come on nep
[2022-12-30 15:12:46] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> WHAT DID THE OTHER PERSON HAVE TO BE SORRY ABOUT? it was a toxic celebration
[2022-12-30 15:12:46] <+memphisdepie88> a nepo baby is this years buzz word apparently

[2022-12-30 15:12:50] <Bret__> It is 100% toxic
[2022-12-30 15:12:51] <+jye247> if you say sorry to someone irl is that toxic too?
[2022-12-30 15:12:52] <+memphisdepie88> time to get it marketed

[2022-12-30 15:13:06] <lowkey_cole> Nep thats not a toxic celli
[2022-12-30 15:13:08] <Ad_aamm> Legit whenever I tune into Nep he's beefing someone or chat. No other streamer does that lmao.

[2022-12-30 15:16:42] <%+danii6789> I personally only celebrate when im trying to be toxic to the opponent, so id see his 1-0 celebration as toxic as well
[2022-12-30 15:16:44] <%krk0707> simple solution he should of took the w then message u thanks or something
[2022-12-30 15:16:47] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think a lot it is perspective. I could see an awful lot of stuff as toxic. It goes back to the Derek thing right? Like he might actually be trying to say thank you. Then when he‚Äôs not getting a free win he doesn‚Äôt celebrate right? That makes sense and is the least toxic thing to do after the second goal. Admittedly, his griddy on the third kills my argument but still.

[2022-12-30 15:29:42] <+bdub2890> Cheer100 a bit off topic but as an Arsenal fan from the states what are your thoughts on the plan they have for the transfer window. much love been watching for years.
[2022-12-30 15:29:47] <%lpd1996> i know its very rare but if a game irl cannot be continued due to the other team the team lose
[2022-12-30 15:29:55] <%+3omar_astro> what about dissconecting from the game?
[2022-12-30 15:30:00] <%+nathjasper95> Bit of a weird way to put it from me but when you type your password in wrong on your phone so many times you get blocked out for a minute then 2mins the more you do it the higher time your blocked out for.. if you quit games should work the way in fifa haha
[2022-12-30 15:30:08] <%divkush> i dont want a 30 minute cooldown if i quit a game that im losing 3-0 though
[2022-12-30 15:30:09] <%lpd1996> they had that rule in past fifas but removed it, its so silly
[2022-12-30 15:30:11] <%+tobywankenobi101> happens in draft when the opponent quits when you're winning it's classed as a 3-0, why not just transfer that across everything regardless of the score
[2022-12-30 15:30:29] <%+jphil489> Feeling like Arsenal could use a Partey backup IMO
[2022-12-30 15:30:43] <%lpd1996> all they need to do is give a 3-0 loss thats it
[2022-12-30 15:30:45] <%+nathjasper95> Yeah true haha
[2022-12-30 15:30:48] <%+3omar_astro> yeah fair
[2022-12-30 15:30:57] <%SimpleSimi> if it‚Äôs a draw and your opponent quits no matter how it should be a win
[2022-12-30 15:31:06] <bdub2890> i know they like tielemans as well but he's on a free if they sign him
[2022-12-30 15:31:12] <%+anth0ny0rrell> theyd have to turn pc cross play off if they did that
[2022-12-30 15:31:13] <@%$ItsTr3ple> The Toulouse defender you had in Sorare scored a mad own goal too, he defo didn't want you to win a reward LUL

[2022-12-30 16:08:40] <@sorarejosh> yh every team has a couple players who are too good for the league
[2022-12-30 16:08:42] <%+brendanmcd8> i would say the pace at which MLS is played at has changed quite a bit in the last 2-3years - it used to be HARD to watch
[2022-12-30 16:08:45] <%+DirtyDishFC> MLS isdefinitely stepping up and the WorldCup coming to USA will bring more
[2022-12-30 16:09:05] <%+stackmillz> lots of players are leaving mls and going over seas and vice versa

[2022-12-30 16:10:08] <%+jphil489> games are usually 2+ goals

[2022-12-30 16:10:13] <%+mikekozy23> plus messi's coming
[2022-12-30 16:10:14] <%+Pokes21228> With all of the new soccer specific stadiums and the budgets, its getting pretty decent. MLS has done a good job of farming South American talent in the past few years
[2022-12-30 16:10:14] <%+kikasfp1990> they are investing so much in good players and marketing for WC en USA Canada
[2022-12-30 16:10:18] <%+cerys_fifa> fully agree
[2022-12-30 16:10:22] <%+Brandez84> The MLS final I thought was an awesome advert for them!
[2022-12-30 16:10:22] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> World cup 2026 will be huge for them
[2022-12-30 16:10:24] <%+DirtyDishFC> I think Academies for every club has helped the technical level of your normal MLS players
[2022-12-30 16:10:36] <%+always_rainy98> do they not have relegation in MLS? Feel like it adds element of risk and excitement

[2022-12-30 16:11:36] <%+DirtyDishFC> I think MLS will go to 40 teams and make two tiers for a faux relegation/promotion but in a controlled situattion where owners investments arent completely destroyed
[2022-12-30 16:11:36] <%+brendanmcd8> best thing MLS did was embrace the Pacific Northwest - they lost most major sports teams outside of the NFL team and its made the fans "super supporters" if you will
[2022-12-30 16:11:38] <%+jphil489> Pheonix Rising?

[2022-12-30 16:12:16] <%chrisdepot> Sacramento as well I think
[2022-12-30 16:12:21] <%+Declan_lfc> i used to watch the Mls back in like 2015 when i used to play topps kick and it was very hard to watch
[2022-12-30 16:12:24] <+Lukeflynn89> Ruidiaz for Seattle Sounders is basically gaurunteed goals
[2022-12-30 16:12:24] <%+stackmillz> the world cup being in the usa in 4 years will deffinately help as well
[2022-12-30 16:12:35] <%+DirtyDishFC> Sacramento

[2022-12-30 16:12:40] <%+SportingMoose> Sacramento was coming, but their investors backed out
[2022-12-30 16:12:47] <@%Witchwalker70> I thought it was just St Louis

[2022-12-30 16:13:52] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The other thing is they‚Äôre building to 2026. They want a really competitive national team so they‚Äôre doing everything possible to give American youth players a chance. And I think it‚Äôs their quality that is dragging the League up rather than European imports.
[2022-12-30 16:13:52] <%+stackmillz> the world cup being in the usa in 4 years will deffinately help as well
[2022-12-30 16:13:57] <%+jphil489> Austin would put 5 past Louisville
[2022-12-30 16:14:01] <+SCF08onFIFA> San Diego Loyal in that league will join in MLS in 2024. That's Landon Donovans team
[2022-12-30 16:14:04] <%+sheriffshinetop> Do they have an expansion draft in the MLS when they add a new team, like they do in the NHL?
[2022-12-30 16:14:06] <%+jphil489> its also that a lot of US players go the college route
[2022-12-30 16:14:07] <%+Pokes21228> it would be like Wrexham getting promoted from the National League into the Prem lol
[2022-12-30 16:14:27] <%andysoccer2> The one good thing is the USA national team is playing in the Copa America

[2022-12-30 16:18:31] <%$SmallBearSports> To be fair, as someone who follows the USMNT very closely, our manager Berhalter is about as useful as a shit flavored lollipop
[2022-12-30 16:18:31] <%+Pokes21228> Berhalter's team selection is horrific. He played the likes of Shaq Moore and Yedlin over Joe Scally. Scally has been starting for Gladbach at the age of 19/20

[2022-12-30 16:18:48] <%andysoccer2> Gregg Berhalters main objective was we will take players who are in top form right now. And players that will play a major role in the World Cup run
[2022-12-30 16:18:49] <%+jphil489> There is no reason the US wouldn't be able to attract a top level manager at this point

[2022-12-30 16:20:36] <%+DirtyDishFC> Yes. We  got to the knockouts IN SPITE of our manager
[2022-12-30 16:20:37] <%+jphil489> The US job is top 5 in the world leading to 2026 IMO
[2022-12-30 16:20:40] <%awaydayoffender> sounds like the old boys network

[2022-12-30 16:20:45] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Imagine if Southgate did something like that, he would be absolutely crucified
[2022-12-30 16:20:51] <%+Pokes21228> he is probably going to get extended. I pray he isn't in charge in 2026, I think it could be a coming out party for us if we have a decent manager
[2022-12-30 16:20:55] <%+motadace> all this talk is making we want to join in the sorare hype

[2022-12-30 16:30:33] <%DmacPrototype> I hated FB with the fact that if I comment on your stream all my friends list and family see it
[2022-12-30 16:30:36] <%+kingofthekop> i hate the meta that they have too you have to have a facebook to use the vr
[2022-12-30 16:30:36] <jess___> Or like Instagram. (Ima sub when I get to my computer)
[2022-12-30 16:30:36] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Itd be like them acquiring whatsapp, deleting it and replacing it with texts.
[2022-12-30 16:30:46] <%+Smudge__Cat> 100%, I didn't talk on facebook streams because it's linked directly to my account - posting the stream onto other people's walls.. I don't want my gaming preferences bleeding into other people's feeds.
[2022-12-30 16:30:49] <%+Apple22> i enjoyed mixer alot tbh
[2022-12-30 16:30:56] <trghz> The Facebook streaming layout is so backwards. Couldn‚Äôt get on with at all as a viewer
[2022-12-30 16:30:57] <%chrisparks21> Youtube is really clunky too
[2022-12-30 16:30:59] <%+joshua12012000> that's madness
[2022-12-30 16:31:03] <%chrisparks21> That's why I dont use it
[2022-12-30 16:31:05] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> One of the problems with Facebook is people have to use their own accounts, so if they send a message anyone could look them up
[2022-12-30 16:31:24] <%+kingofthekop> its a nightmare to start up an account on there to start streaming on there too i tried a long time ago
[2022-12-30 16:31:29] <%+penson37> I really enjoyed watching you on Twitch, sometimes watched you on Mixer when you were there, but I can't lie I never thought to myself to watch you on Facebook so I watched very few FB streams

[2022-12-30 16:32:20] <@%$ItsTr3ple> I just bookmarked your Facebook stream, but if I hadn't I would have been so annoyed LUL

[2022-12-30 16:32:36] <%DmacPrototype> Which when doing what you want for fun it makes content even more enjoyable
[2022-12-30 16:33:09] <%+athletico_pathetico> apart from mom's, does anyone use Facebook anymore?
[2022-12-30 16:33:13] <%+taylorallen133> even with Elon breaking Twitter its still better than FB

[2022-12-30 16:44:06] <%+shemlaa> 6 months is a LONG time especially in that business
[2022-12-30 16:44:06] <%nightfly89> the problem is he does things that go against the grain just because he can. It's unheard of to put a week deadline on a coding project unless you want to fire those people anyway

[2022-12-30 16:44:11] <%+SterlingWinter> It just raised to 6 months was like 60 days when this was all happening so folks on visas in the US have to find a new job and when tech was implementing hiring freezes in the US across the board plus it's hard to find a job that sponsors visas

[2022-12-30 16:48:56] <%nightfly89> of course musk knows what he's doing he is making money by having employees not being able to vest their stock and creating cap space, it's just imoral and that's why i was reactionary

[2022-12-30 16:49:09] <%+grumpysrtg> didn't tesla price tank for a short time because of what he did on the joe rogan experience
[2022-12-30 16:49:11] <%+SterlingWinter> it was highest because of the price he agreed to pay per share though to acquire it
[2022-12-30 16:49:11] <%$SmallBearSports> That was based on the valuation of the share buyout to be fair
[2022-12-30 16:49:15] <%+ReazMimic> @SpreadsheetFifa that was tesla not twitter
[2022-12-30 16:49:18] <%chrisparks21> Didn't it go up because he was locked into buying it for too much?

[2022-12-30 17:01:06] <%+xxacehitmanxx> i assume if youre fired without "cause" you get severance. If there is a cause or you dont fulfil your requirementsthen no severance
[2022-12-30 17:01:12] <%+Pokes21228> My understanding of it is you can be fire for "cause" but don't really have to prove/explain the cause. You can simply say fired for cause xyz

[2022-12-30 17:02:22] <%$SmallBearSports> Its very likely that there are contractual reasons. IE if you are fired for cause you don't get severance, where as if you are laid off or let go through redundancy they get severance. The tasks that are impossible to complete Twitter would then argue shows that the worker was fired for performance and therefore not entitled to severance
[2022-12-30 17:02:23] <%czechmate92576> surely you wouldn't quit knowing that
[2022-12-30 17:02:25] <johnthegg> @dbabbs87 make even more jobs by firing 75% of the people that work for Twitter? that's some logic
[2022-12-30 17:02:26] <%EasyGriezy> @dbabbs87 but thats what people want Elon to do, but we know taking just WeWork as an example that's not how you run a business
[2022-12-30 17:02:33] <%+mikekozy23> right but you'd still be out of a job along with the other 3000 top level software engineers, and then have to struggle through finding one
[2022-12-30 17:02:41] <%+ReazMimic> also, why is it a bad thing if you get a 3 month pay packet, then you get 1/3 months to find a new job? sound alright to me
[2022-12-30 17:02:41] <%+joebalazek> We don't know all the specifics of their individual contracts, or the agreements that were made when he purchased the company.  The are almost all likely salaried employees.  There is no 9-5, its work to get the job done.
[2022-12-30 17:02:45] <%+xxacehitmanxx> If youre fired with cause you dont always get severance

[2022-12-30 17:04:24] <%+joebalazek> That is for non contract employees.  The twitter employees in question almost certainly had contracts.

[2022-12-30 17:07:22] <%+ReazMimic> The way i see HR is a separate board  that rules on issues between the company and employees
[2022-12-30 17:07:30] <%+Smudge__Cat> the HR team will be there to protect the company from potential lawsuits - one of the main ones would be people not working over the 'working time directive'
[2022-12-30 17:07:31] <%EasyGriezy> Yes if a company makes you work 20 hours a day the employee can sue the company. HR is a front and makes out like they are stopping workers being exploited, but they are only stopping explotation to prevent lawsuits
[2022-12-30 17:07:34] <%$BobbyTambling> we all have an ego to a degree

[2022-12-30 17:08:09] <%+jokehereee> so this is coming from someone who was unfairly dismissed at my previous job after submitting a grievence against a manager this was in UK. I didnt have enough money for legal fees so i studied it myself for 2 years in April i won a employment tribunal for unfair dismissal. So if they were given an impossible task and were fired for failing the impossible they have a case for unfair dismissal unless people dismissed had a bad record for sickness lateness or poor KPI's
[2022-12-30 17:08:17] <%+Pokes21228> I think what happened at twitter probably happens at other companies in the US. But since it was Musk and Twitter, it was highly publicized

[2022-12-30 17:14:07] <%$SmallBearSports> To be clear free speech in America is a function of protecting the citizens from being prosecuted by the government for what they say, and even there the Supreme Court has ruled there are limitations there (can't yell fire in a crowded theater etc.). There is zero correlation between the first amendment and requiring a platform to allow all types of speech.

[2022-12-30 17:21:39] <%$SmallBearSports> There was an interesting point brought up earlier which I think deserves more of an exploration on many levels, which is that in labor disputes, very often the public sides with the opulently wealthy owner versus the employees. Its especially true in American sport, whenever there is a strike or lockout. Where the public stands against the "millionaire" athletes and agrees with the billionaire owners calling the players greedy. I've never really been able to wrap my head around why.

Also Biden signed budget with 45 billions of USD to Ukraine.

[2022-12-30 17:38:09] <%BobbyTambling> i agree that racism shouldn't be in football, i mean, you have to be braindead to disagree with that. but i don't think it's right to call a player racist if he doesn't want to take the knee, if he says, im not racist but im not doing that, like Alonso, he and his family got so much abuse for that

[2022-12-30 17:47:29] <%+LukeO94> Everything you say will is scrutinised and it boils down to the fact that people are taking offence. Offence is taken not given and it seems to hold some sort of power. "Oh you can't do that, they'll be offended"
[2022-12-30 17:47:34] <%+brendanmcd8> the real problem is media picks up extremes because it sells news papers or generates clicks - most people are incredibly moderate

[2022-12-30 17:52:04] <%$SmallBearSports> A lot of this stems from 2016-present when for a myriad of reasons, everything became either Left or Right. They are trying to kill off the moderate viewpoints both in politics and media. However, things have still held up because in elections, the moderates/independents still vote in droves. However, it really does feel like 45% of the people hate the opposing separate 45% of the people and we're down to 10% of people who have to keep their shit together in order for us to function.
[2022-12-30 17:52:05] <%EasyGriezy> I used to like Tate but the more I watched the more you see he is a massive hypocrite

[2022-12-30 17:53:13] <%+LukeO94> He has the influence, but is irresponsible with it (at times). On the flip side, you have an (unwanted) influence but are generally responsible with it

[2022-12-30 17:53:45] <%Dezalleycat> It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs right though,and while people are not free of thought they see Jordan Peterson as a threat
[2022-12-30 17:53:51] <%nightfly89> Jordan Peterson has a lot of intelligent things to say and a lot make sense, but a lot of them are also debunked. check out Nassim Taleb and his takes on Jordan Peterson.

[2022-12-30 18:35:27] <Bazatelli> Unless someone hits his release clause of 120mil only way he goes this window
[2022-12-30 18:35:42] <%+tommy121083> if they meet his release clause he will, and it sounds like theyll actually do that
[2022-12-30 18:35:47] <%+rpc84> No official bid or release clause made for Enzo by any club Fabio saying

[2022-12-30 18:35:57] <%lpd1996> they are apparently only a few mil from his asking price
[2022-12-30 18:36:02] <%+jezzatee2x> Chelsea cant pay the release clause. Thats why we are paying more
[2022-12-30 18:36:07] <%lpd1996> around 115 mil

[2022-12-30 18:36:18] <%+blazzgaming> What Rui Costa said was that he would only leave for his release clause and I think Chelsea are ready to offer it
[2022-12-30 18:36:18] <%SeanSPX> have they even sold anyone

[2022-12-30 18:36:24] <%+mr_nmk> chelsea dont want to pay the 120e, they want a deal for a transfer amount close to release clause
[2022-12-30 18:36:27] <%lpd1996> as a Chelsea fan i honestly have no idea after spending 300 mil
[2022-12-30 18:36:35] <here4rewards_> 600m spent in 6 months if they get Enzo
[2022-12-30 18:36:41] <%+rpc84> financial fair play might look into that
[2022-12-30 18:36:49] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> the thing holding them back is that they want to pay 130m in a few payments, whereas benfica want 120M outright
[2022-12-30 18:36:51] <%Dezalleycat> How TF are Chelsea not being investigated for the money they are spending,,it doesn‚Äôt add up
[2022-12-30 18:36:52] <mrcheeks617> Going two windows without being able to spend helps
[2022-12-30 18:36:56] <%lpd1996> and also apparently nkunku is coming end of the season with the Croatian CB ü§£
[2022-12-30 18:36:56] <%+chad__white> btw nep i found angers in ligue 1 was a good club for the 1 team sbc could be different now but i was spending max 12k for the whole team

[2022-12-30 18:37:37] <%lpd1996> @tommy121083 yeah but he's not a starter
[2022-12-30 18:37:37] <+viperkeith> Chelsea paying more than release clause so they can pay it over instalments
[2022-12-30 18:37:37] <%BobbyTambling> Jorgino
[2022-12-30 18:37:41] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> i'd start him over Kova or Jorginho
