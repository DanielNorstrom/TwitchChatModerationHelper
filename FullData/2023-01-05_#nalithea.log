[2023-01-05 15:32:00] <%Subconscious__> Grim is right, even if they actively tried to keep your payout and not want to give it to you they’d have to have a legitimate reason with evidence otherwise it’s an easy win for you legally nalithPopcorn nalithPopcorn
[2023-01-05 15:32:05] <@%Borky97> u being allowed to stream is pretty much the contract so u can't just sue it has to be with legit proof of twitch causing harm to u but her Changing her email stuff is something that needs to be resolved
[2023-01-05 15:32:08] <kayde_redacted> keep file a complain until they fix your problem
[2023-01-05 15:32:09] <+OfficialDelcos> Wym can't double stream?

[2023-01-05 15:40:43] <+Garouken00> yes, but what are the sanctions? you get kicked from the program?
[2023-01-05 15:40:44] <+Bammtea> their support is horrible

[2023-01-05 15:40:54] <+OfficialDelcos> I see Twitch did a common Twitch thing
[2023-01-05 15:40:57] <lexzoo> is it possible for others to create tickets for you?
[2023-01-05 15:41:14] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea think more positive. It's gonna be fixed. Stop thinking like that. Really. Stop "feeling like". They WILL come back.

[2023-01-05 15:46:03] <%Subconscious__> It’s okay to let it out Nali, but don’t think of this as the end. It’s been a rough thing to deal with i’m sure but it’s not over. Twitch might be very slow on the response but they’ll get back to you. If it comes down to it send them an email asking about your tickets every day if you have to, but don’t let this discourage you from doing what you love. We’d all hate to see your streams end and we’ll gladly do whatever we can to help nalithLove nalithLove nalithLove nalithLove

[2023-01-05 16:40:42] <%Nickgman101> charge her balls and use here balls more frequently

[2023-01-05 16:42:40] <@%Grimstab77> welcome here
[2023-01-05 16:42:42] <JGHorror> I think they wanted to make her more aggressive with her teleporter and less for Stalling
[2023-01-05 16:42:52] <%Nickgman101> they did it so you can't just perminently boost your team to the point constantly
[2023-01-05 16:43:25] <Danysovy1> playing quick?
[2023-01-05 16:43:27] <@%Grimstab77> Yes her new TP is a better movement tool than the previous one. They put a duration on it to force player to use it more as a movement tool
[2023-01-05 16:43:29] <+truehache> was a nice one!!
[2023-01-05 16:43:29] <+ellystrawberry> nicesu u r doing great nali

[2023-01-05 16:43:51] <@%+zyron999> The teleporter only lasts 10 seconds now
[2023-01-05 16:44:12] VIEWERS: 319
[2023-01-05 16:44:26] <@%Grimstab77> Since you wont read. The TP lasts 10s Nali'. it goes faster than in ow1 so you can use it as a movement tool but you can't just use it in spawn.
[2023-01-05 16:44:43] <Danysovy1> @Grimstab77 nali gonna play dps in comp? ù

[2023-01-05 17:15:33] <@%Grimstab77> @xx_wolfi_the_ghost_xx I'm a zen main, but I know how to play the game arxukRave
[2023-01-05 17:15:41] <JGHorror> Mercy is so dependent on her team
[2023-01-05 17:15:43] <%Nickgman101> same
[2023-01-05 17:15:57] <ac3_supernova> how do you permanetly fly with mercy without ult
[2023-01-05 17:16:12] VIEWERS: 374
[2023-01-05 17:16:32] <ac3_supernova> I thought it was shift and then space I skiped the crouch
[2023-01-05 17:16:34] <%farhood3000> you can also hold crouch i think
[2023-01-05 17:16:57] <%Nickgman101> I don't even use the crouch jump technique
[2023-01-05 17:16:59] <%farhood3000> for floating
[2023-01-05 17:17:11] <@%Grimstab77> Do not hold crouch
[2023-01-05 17:17:21] <ac3_supernova> im new on mercy
[2023-01-05 17:17:31] <ac3_supernova> I main tanks
[2023-01-05 17:17:42] <%Nickgman101> I just use the new movement which is where ever your looking
[2023-01-05 17:17:44] <+ellystrawberry> i play mercy a lot but newish to overwatch
[2023-01-05 17:17:46] <ac3_supernova> yeah shes pretty fun
[2023-01-05 17:17:52] <%farhood3000> @Grimstab77 can you not hold crouch to float like space?
[2023-01-05 17:17:53] <@%Grimstab77> You press crouch during your shift to gain height, then you hold space until your next shift. You use your shit on CD and you crouch as soon as your shift starts. And you'll be flying
[2023-01-05 17:17:59] <@%Grimstab77> nope
