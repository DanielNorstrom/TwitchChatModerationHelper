[2022-12-05 22:46:38] <AslanGrants> it's used for largescale raids
[2022-12-05 22:47:02] <AslanGrants> basically, on its default settings, it'll nuke chat, put it in slow mode, where only 1 month subscribers or more can talk

[2022-12-05 23:01:56] <%FloofyMaki> The people who dox are small sad ppl. If ever you see them talking or in a interview they are weak sounding nerds. Doxxing is a power fantasy, they want to feel powerful to hide from their own self hate.

I just deleted the tweet they replied to and have been privated again. Can't wait to go unprivate and make fun of them again. Kiwifarmers are so sad.

[2022-12-05 23:11:36] <%KaiSakurai> @nathan103grem why chansey and not blissey though? but yes for supp its good. but as attacker: flutter mane. for charizard even better than azumarill. also since azumarill is completely broken on raids... damage cant be calculated correctly... hp bar jumps like crazy

[2022-12-05 23:12:27] <@%NautAJerman> chansey because eviolite doubles def and special def so it would make it more tanky than blisseu @KaiSakurai

[2022-12-05 23:16:31] <@%NautAJerman> @KaiSakurai chansey more tanky than Blissey with Eviolite. Blissey only has 5 base more Hp than Chansey, but chasey has 23 more special defense than Blissey when having the eviol;ite equpped so imo chansey would be better @KaiSakurai
