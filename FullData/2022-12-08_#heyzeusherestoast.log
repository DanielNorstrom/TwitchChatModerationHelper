[2022-12-08 12:55:27] <%$akaWrecks> Zeus needs to start streaming at 5am so I have something to watch while I work.
[2022-12-08 13:55:09] <%klevas17> good morning
[2022-12-08 14:00:16] <%nwmn420> heyzeusScooch
[2022-12-08 14:00:35] <%nwmn420> 8am sharp, he says OpieOP
[2022-12-08 14:00:46] <%nwmn420> heyzeusHi
[2022-12-08 14:00:53] <%nwmn420> heyzeusLove
[2022-12-08 14:06:45] <%$akaWrecks> Well, he's online.  He just needs to hit that stream button.
[2022-12-08 14:07:17] <%$akaWrecks> I'm curious what is his plans with that streamelements bot I saw yesterday, or was it the day before?  I can't remember.
[2022-12-08 14:07:38] <%$akaWrecks> *are his plans.  Grammar is hard.
[2022-12-08 14:07:50] <~%heyZeusHeresToast> punishment for mitch for saying cheese pizza again
[2022-12-08 14:08:04] <%nwmn420> seemed like it came on by accident when he left stream (idk i went to wash my hands, then turned around and stream was over) tuesday. yesterday i jokingly said go away streamelements and then its mesage was gone oh hey Zeus
[2022-12-08 14:08:04] <%$akaWrecks> Haha, I'm all for mitchbot punishment
[2022-12-08 14:08:47] <~%heyZeusHeresToast> It's for a potential sponsor. I was supposed to do it that day but there have been some contract negotiations so I took it off lol
[2022-12-08 14:08:49] <%Skyzark_Vic> whats up nerds
[2022-12-08 14:09:03] <~%heyZeusHeresToast> Give me a few minutes guys, just want to walk rori and I'll be on
[2022-12-08 14:09:21] <%$akaWrecks> @heyZeusHeresToast So next captain's auction is this weekend.  Nothing on my must have list so I may actually not need to rearrange my garage this weekend.  Also none of the pinball machines on your list are there either.
[2022-12-08 14:09:24] <%nwmn420> oh nice
[2022-12-08 14:09:53] <%$akaWrecks> @heyZeusHeresToast Though, he still has another 100+ lots to add to the catalog, so we'll see if that changes by tomorrow afternoon.
[2022-12-08 14:09:56] <%nwmn420> i used to really enjoy playing this High Roller Casino pinball game, then one day it was just gone from the local arcade :(
[2022-12-08 14:10:27] <%$akaWrecks> I have too many pinball machines as it is in my currnet space, well, too many everything really.
[2022-12-08 14:10:32] <%nwmn420> @Skyzark_Vic yo
[2022-12-08 14:10:42] <%Skyzark_Vic> @nwmn420 well if it isnt thick dick nwmn
[2022-12-08 14:10:47] <%nwmn420> LUL wrecks time to open that dream arcade/pinball shop of yours
[2022-12-08 14:10:55] <%nwmn420> LUL sky OpieOP
[2022-12-08 14:11:06] <%Skyzark_Vic> wrecks i would make a pilgrimage to your pinball place if you did that
[2022-12-08 14:11:18] <%$akaWrecks> Well the warehouse is still under construction, but it's on track for march/april completion, so I can probably move in and finish it up in may, which is perfect since D4 launches June 4th
[2022-12-08 14:12:02] <%nwmn420> brittney griner is coming home finally
[2022-12-08 14:12:06] <%klevas17> hey all
[2022-12-08 14:12:09] <%$akaWrecks> Haha, the barcade won't open until 2024 most likely, unless I get a sudden surge of cash before the  summer to start all my license filings.
[2022-12-08 14:12:31] <%nwmn420> ah i see
[2022-12-08 14:12:44] <%nwmn420> it'll be here before you know it, at least
[2022-12-08 14:13:22] <%$akaWrecks> I might need to drop a couple contracts when the time comes.  That will be weird.
[2022-12-08 14:13:32] <%nwmn420> yeah that's not like you LUL
[2022-12-08 14:13:49] <%nwmn420> wow coldest morning so far this year, 66F
[2022-12-08 14:14:07] <%nwmn420> well i can't say this year, it gets colder in the early months and i recall it was colder in feb so nvm
[2022-12-08 14:14:25] <%nwmn420> :D
[2022-12-08 14:17:22] <%Skyzark_Vic> @nwmn420 thats about the coldest florida gets yeah?
[2022-12-08 14:17:42] <%nwmn420> nah
[2022-12-08 14:17:52] <%nwmn420> we'll get a lot of 40 and 50s in feb
[2022-12-08 14:18:17] <%nwmn420> the rare 30s maybe one or two nights and if we're really lucky it'll be in the 40s during the daytime, though that typically happens once a decade
[2022-12-08 14:20:03] <%klevas17> its 45 in the place where i work...

[2022-12-08 14:33:39] <%nwmn420> @Skyzark_Vic when i played it i was messing around in co-op and apparenlty there's a glitch, you can't let your summon co-op into the boss arena during phase 1 or it would get stuck. i assume it's been patched

[2022-12-08 15:00:53] <%+antonijoe> i think they buffed the greatswords
[2022-12-08 15:00:53] <+Makani87> I like Ds3 PVP, but not really Elden Ring. It just doesn't fit as well, too much crazy shit.
[2022-12-08 15:01:23] <%SilverWind19C> long hairs and beards is what fromsoftware’s character creators need
[2022-12-08 15:01:26] <%+antonijoe> the like reduced the time it takes to between swings i think
[2022-12-08 15:01:26] <%$akaWrecks> only slightly, the crouched poke is like, a few frames faster.  That's the whole greatsword buff.
[2022-12-08 15:01:29] <%JohnnyBullet> u gonna be live for game awards or watch it off stream?
[2022-12-08 15:01:44] <@%MitchP1983> @JohnnyBullet Yep, live and streaming it!

[2022-12-08 15:22:28] <%$akaWrecks> sous vide steak is how i do it like 80% of the time.  Set the temp to like 15 degrees shy of medium rare, and i set that shit up in the morning.  it will maintain that until i'm ready to cook and it's literally impossible to overcook.  Then throw it in cast iron at nuclear temp to reverse sear and butter baste the outside for a min, and done.

[2022-12-08 15:47:17] <WinnieBagel> I was wondering what GRRMartin contributed since the lore seems typical fromsoft, but this character makes it clear, it’s the soap opera LUL Just who’s shagging who and who doesn’t like it - game of thrones in a nutshell.

[2022-12-08 15:48:10] <Necropsygist> but you need the map west side to see it
[2022-12-08 15:48:12] <%$frigidligament> I think carinan manor is where you quit on the whip run @heyzeusherestoast

[2022-12-08 15:49:47] <%SilverWind19C> remember that when radahn is locked you have that gank fight against a lion dude and the knight, although their AIs are more passive now
[2022-12-08 15:49:48] <7ckingmad_bw> are you thinking about some quest already?
[2022-12-08 15:49:51] <%houssodheim> imagine when he finds out there's a trio fight

[2022-12-08 15:57:23] <LisbonSenpai> to breath of the wild like lul
[2022-12-08 15:57:24] <+mooredore> but isnt BloodBorne linear?
[2022-12-08 15:57:25] <%nwmn420> give it time and you'll know it like the back of your hand, i bet
[2022-12-08 15:57:27] <@%MitchP1983> @swagaroni Yes, hence the title.
[2022-12-08 15:57:29] <third_voice> this game is awsome, but its just tooo open, and this is reason why i never played it again

[2022-12-08 15:57:47] <Necropsygist> just stick to the left side , you will find a path
[2022-12-08 15:57:48] <%nwmn420> optional bosses makes it non-linear for sure
[2022-12-08 15:57:50] <%daddyshaggy12> What time is the game awards

[2022-12-08 15:58:03] <%faisal_db> bloodborne is the best game of all time

[2022-12-08 15:58:53] <%$goodguypatches> I feel that all boss runs are too much for Elden Ring, but an all remembrances run is the business

[2022-12-08 15:59:02] <%houssodheim> I see it as a fun thing personally. trying to figure out how get to places, but i get what you mean
[2022-12-08 15:59:04] <Necropsygist> you will need a gesture to unlock this place
[2022-12-08 15:59:05] <%a1eph_zer0> @mebloscianka2115 Completionist tendencies are OG, that is why Bloodborne rocks.

[2022-12-08 16:21:10] <%+InkBlotTest> I've contemplated trying to run for Congress solely on the platform of let's reform the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Pretty sure I would get elected.
[2022-12-08 16:21:11] <Necropsygist> yup
[2022-12-08 16:21:19] <Dysfunkshnl> The fact that game publishers aren't getting paid from these streaming services is NUTS.
[2022-12-08 16:21:25] <+MajinSR> YouTube's just scared of getting sued by the music industry, that's why it's so skewed. they're not even following the law.
[2022-12-08 16:21:29] <urbanknight> it's stupid, especially since you're technically advertising the music as well?
[2022-12-08 16:21:35] <%Zolton_theAirman> I'd argue that since you paid FromSoft for the game, you shouldn't have to give them a split

[2022-12-08 16:21:56] <%Speed_84> I always had no clue how people upload Guitar Hero/Rock Band videos without getting that. Not sure if those are demonetized or not.
[2022-12-08 16:21:57] <+DidYouKnowGaming> @Zolton_theAirman Disagreed - you buy a BluRay, you can't distribute it online as a result
[2022-12-08 16:21:58] <%$MsLatina> my goodness

[2022-12-08 16:26:57] <%$MsLatina> lore is good on all games but bloodborne hits you different
[2022-12-08 16:27:04] <hagardhonky> not bloodborne or dark souls level
[2022-12-08 16:27:05] <%$oubbascooba> I like the lady who eats grapes
[2022-12-08 16:27:07] <%Blog_12345> the Paleblood Hunt cemented BB lore as being the best
[2022-12-08 16:27:12] <Dysfunkshnl> But there's so much more narrative in Bloodborne that just isn't here in ER
[2022-12-08 16:27:12] <ropzyy_> its simpler than the other soulsborne lore

[2022-12-08 16:47:37] <G__han> Oil is actually cheap right now. but companies like to rip people off.
[2022-12-08 16:47:38] <%+AlexShotFirst> Should ask Russia for help

[2022-12-08 16:47:44] <%Skyzark_Vic> i think USA's endgame world strat for oil is to hold on to alaska's reserves
[2022-12-08 16:47:48] <%$DinkyDolphin> why would oil companies want to extract more oil when they have record profits right now?
[2022-12-08 16:47:57] <Itsyaboyjj> Fun fact the bats singing is an ancient Japanese dialect that only just over 300 people can sort of understand

[2022-12-08 16:48:48] <%+shinra441> heard at a white house press briefing there are like 90 unused drilling permits in the US that companies arent using for some reason
[2022-12-08 16:48:48] <%+AlexShotFirst> Also I tell everyone I’m from central Jersey and no one believes me. Central Jersey exists right?
[2022-12-08 16:48:51] <%+Jartasm> Not only are there places we haven't checked, but one of the reasons oil is so expensive these days is how many large oil companies already own exploration leases and aren't using them.
[2022-12-08 16:48:59] <%SilverWind19C> i'll be in my 70s by then

[2022-12-08 16:57:56] <$Jessy103> @grant_us_ice Aien Isolation has great vents imo
[2022-12-08 16:58:02] <$herbal_kent> @mothdaddywubs unbalanced weapon arts, glitches like you just saw against the wyrm.  Performance issues, etc.  a great game but far from perfect
[2022-12-08 16:58:03] <%DaveyBanana> Kinda like Bloodborne Chalice Dungeons?
[2022-12-08 16:58:05] <sparrowmcjack> it's just a very big world to fill, kinda impossible for all the bosses to be unique

[2022-12-08 16:58:58] <+bubududufan> the map needed to be at max 50% of its current size
[2022-12-08 16:58:59] <$herbal_kent> But ER is my number 2 or 3 From game (including Sekiro)
[2022-12-08 16:59:00] <$Sionistic> what is there is great, but it gets a bit too drawn out
[2022-12-08 16:59:04] <%$phan_the_mighty> but if you cut stuff out of the world the map won't be shaped like a finger
[2022-12-08 16:59:05] <%$harpocr4te> All the snow could have been cut
[2022-12-08 16:59:11] <+bubududufan> and 75% of copy and paste dungeons and repeat bosses removed

[2022-12-08 16:59:29] <grant_us_ice> @jessy103 I agree. Most terrifying too

[2022-12-08 17:01:00] <%mercvrias> the weapon is kinda fun
[2022-12-08 17:01:02] <%+volf4321> @spinochio It happens all the time
[2022-12-08 17:01:09] <%sirbarlionel> do you like the sword it gave you, @heyZeusHeresToast  ?

[2022-12-08 17:01:41] <%DaveyBanana> Biggest issue is that there’s no Cleric Beast

[2022-12-08 17:01:42] <$herbal_kent> I’m VERY HAPPY to see Zeus playing ER
[2022-12-08 17:01:48] <GodDamSully> Yeah i deff dont think its perfect also

[2022-12-08 17:01:58] <$Sionistic> for the most part its a great game, just some weird stuff here and there and a bit too long
[2022-12-08 17:02:01] <$herbal_kent> I was 12 vigor my whole run! All about being skilly!
[2022-12-08 17:02:06] <%SilverWind19C> 60 vigor is ideal, but that's a lot of points
[2022-12-08 17:02:08] <%Sif_VI> I cannot wait for malekith and Godfrey fights. Def my favorites in this game
[2022-12-08 17:02:08] <$herbal_kent> Exactly @heyzeusherestoast !!!

[2022-12-08 17:02:25] <%+TTVBeardedRuckus> that makes sense about vigor
[2022-12-08 17:02:26] <%+Minmatar0> Yeha by the end even with 99 vigor you get three shot. Malenias grab attack does 80% of your health.
[2022-12-08 17:02:27] <grant_us_ice> Vigor is hard mode
[2022-12-08 17:02:29] <%$phan_the_mighty> 60 vigor is for pvp
[2022-12-08 17:02:34] <$herbal_kent> @antonijoe facts, but I didn’t run it bc it was too easy
[2022-12-08 17:02:35] <%+TTVBeardedRuckus> 2 shot anyway

[2022-12-08 17:03:43] <%SilverWind19C> procs fire...but maybe you need more faith
[2022-12-08 17:03:45] <Putrefy> The thing is Open World formula is just so easy to sell. Its easy to hype people up with it, they dig it and buy it. I think there is a huge correlation between daily hours invested and repeated patters, longer sessions often show more flaws of those games but most people won't see it given the fact they play 2-3 hours a day at most

[2022-12-08 17:22:54] <%+Minmatar0> Honestly Zeus that weapons isnt great. THe L2 is a tad weak imo.
[2022-12-08 17:23:00] <+Sleeping_Giants_> @swagaroni yeah a little deeper
[2022-12-08 17:23:03] <%klevas17> cant he just kill him now and take the wepon?

[2022-12-08 17:23:12] <%frankie_baxter> He just has to be at the Warmasters shack
[2022-12-08 17:23:20] <%nwmn420> @swagaroni he also vastly upgraded his mic/amp setup since then
[2022-12-08 17:23:24] <+Sleeping_Giants_> @Minmatar0 but.. but it has a snake on it lol
[2022-12-08 17:23:26] <%+Minmatar0> might as well get the giant club and call it a day

[2022-12-08 17:24:09] <%frankie_baxter> Warmasters shack
[2022-12-08 17:24:10] <CountHedgehog> @heyZeusHeresToast this guy is the same guy that is in warmaster shack selling weapon arts. just clap his cheeks there and he drops all his stuff
[2022-12-08 17:24:10] <%+Minmatar0> You missed it. u needed to kill him in the shack
[2022-12-08 17:24:11] <+bubududufan> you can kill him in limgrave and get it
[2022-12-08 17:24:13] <Zaki_Yagi> you cant anymore he left the shack
[2022-12-08 17:24:15] <%$vecci64> I don’t think you can
[2022-12-08 17:24:15] <+shaye_the_doll> you cant get it ealrier now, he's not in the shack anymore
[2022-12-08 17:24:17] <%$MsLatina> at the end of this whole playthrough
[2022-12-08 17:24:17] <%bugsbunny_xd> Its too late i think
[2022-12-08 17:24:20] <%+Grayfawks509> You have to kill him in Limgrave at the war masters shack before he moves here
[2022-12-08 17:24:21] <%$phan_the_mighty> you just kill him in warmasters shack

[2022-12-08 17:24:31] <%$MothDaddyWubs> Bummed that vol 2 of the hardcover guide doesnt drop until march, but vol 1 is so awesome, pretty stoked
[2022-12-08 17:24:32] <%+DadBeard4> But he’s gone now
[2022-12-08 17:24:32] <%eldritch_lie> Just tell him to check something out in the next room, hope he leaves his weapon, then take it and leave :)
[2022-12-08 17:24:32] <%+antonijoe> @eldritch_lie where do i get it?
[2022-12-08 17:24:34] <+bubududufan> i think you are locked out of that possibility because he moved to volcano manor
[2022-12-08 17:24:41] <%$MsLatina> check the letter you got zeus
[2022-12-08 17:24:44] <+Sleeping_Giants_> why wouldnt killing him now drop it
[2022-12-08 17:24:47] <%eldritch_lie> @antonijoe I think amazon sells it
[2022-12-08 17:24:47] <+bubududufan> now you need to finish his questline and kill him in farum azula
[2022-12-08 17:24:49] <%$phan_the_mighty> now you have to finish his quest
[2022-12-08 17:24:58] <%$phan_the_mighty> can't kill him now
[2022-12-08 17:24:58] <CountHedgehog> oh, doesn't he leave the shack only if you open volcano manor door?
[2022-12-08 17:25:01] <+bubududufan> you cant kill him now, no weapons allowed
[2022-12-08 17:25:02] <%+DadBeard4> You can’t hurt him here because you’re in a saferoom
[2022-12-08 17:25:07] <%+Minmatar0> You cant attack him in volcanic manor
[2022-12-08 17:25:08] <+Sleeping_Giants_> damn
[2022-12-08 17:25:09] <DaddyTTown> He doesnt go back
[2022-12-08 17:25:15] <CloakedSage> It's because you can't fight in Volcano manor.
[2022-12-08 17:25:17] <DaddyTTown> And warmaster shack is in limgrave below the colosseum
[2022-12-08 17:25:17] <+shaye_the_doll> saferoom mechanic bullshit imo
[2022-12-08 17:25:19] <%+Minmatar0> do his quest you get some nice armor then kill later
[2022-12-08 17:25:20] <%bugsbunny_xd> I can drop you one
[2022-12-08 17:25:27] <+Sleeping_Giants_> boss isnt that great but still awesome llooking

[2022-12-08 17:25:44] <%swagaroni> Have you tried the bloodhound fang?

[2022-12-08 17:26:04] <+shaye_the_doll> yes you can lol
[2022-12-08 17:26:05] <%bugsbunny_xd> You can
[2022-12-08 17:26:08] <houssodheim> You totally can pick them up
[2022-12-08 17:26:09] <%$phan_the_mighty> yes you can

[2022-12-08 17:26:10] <%frankie_baxter> LUL you can
[2022-12-08 17:26:12] <CloakedSage> f course you can
[2022-12-08 17:26:13] <%swagaroni> Give it a shot
[2022-12-08 17:26:13] <%$vecci64> Yes you can
[2022-12-08 17:26:14] <%SilverWind19C> what who said that lol
[2022-12-08 17:26:15] <%$MsLatina> yes you can
[2022-12-08 17:26:16] <angeredsnowmen> @swagaroni He did yes
[2022-12-08 17:26:16] <CountHedgehog> @heyZeusHeresToast that's deliberate bait. when he's in warmaster shack he wields different weapon than this scepter (but still drops the sceter tho), probably so players don't kill him early for that weapon
[2022-12-08 17:26:17] <+shaye_the_doll> you can but not upgraded
[2022-12-08 17:26:17] <%$vecci64> The fuck

[2022-12-08 17:26:28] <%bugsbunny_xd> I can upgrade it if you want
[2022-12-08 17:26:29] VIEWERS: 893
[2022-12-08 17:26:29] <%nwmn420> golden runes you can, i think
[2022-12-08 17:26:32] <%nwmn420> but not stones?
[2022-12-08 17:26:40] <%$vecci64> @themarkedhunter94 I literally did it last night
[2022-12-08 17:26:44] <Dizul> @ovisy11 there are rules for droped items, check it out.
[2022-12-08 17:26:51] <themarkedhunter94> false he drops saptor warly
[2022-12-08 17:26:51] <DaddyTTown> But the weapon cannot be like for example ur strongest weapon is +5, if they drop u a weapon more than +5 you cannot pick it up
[2022-12-08 17:26:53] <%+TTVBeardedRuckus> another player gave me the bloodhound fang, you can get peoples drops
[2022-12-08 17:26:54] <%SilverWind19C> @bugsbunny_xd don't think zeus will be able to pick it up if you upgrade it
[2022-12-08 17:26:56] <%$MsLatina> you got a letter from the castle to do a mission
[2022-12-08 17:26:56] <CountHedgehog> @heyZeusHeresToast also this scepter needs 25 Faith to wield, so probably a while untill you could use that anyway
[2022-12-08 17:26:56] <brunosantos123456789> Y can drop weapons max out if y already have one max upgraded
[2022-12-08 17:26:57] <%+Minmatar0> this is a bad ass and annoying af area. you should love it Zeus lol
[2022-12-08 17:27:00] <%frankie_baxter> You cant drop upgraded items to other players, if they themselves havent upgraded to that level yet
[2022-12-08 17:27:14] <%SilverWind19C> @frankie_baxter yeah that's it
[2022-12-08 17:27:15] <Zaki_Yagi> this guy whopped my ass for like half an hour

[2022-12-08 17:51:54] <%frankie_baxter> It's not ashes of war thats prohibited, its spirit ashes
[2022-12-08 17:51:55] <@%MitchP1983> @frankiesill It is.

[2022-12-08 18:19:28] <%SilverWind19C> people don't like to get told to follow rules on the inetrnet and wonder why they're excluded from communities
[2022-12-08 18:19:39] <%koosa00> you can get the spell parry from this area

[2022-12-08 18:20:03] <%+NobleKind92> Shoot, I've broken rules before and I'm still here.
[2022-12-08 18:20:06] <%SinistersQuest> Rules mainly don't be a dick and don't be annoying. Easy
[2022-12-08 18:20:12] <@%MitchP1983> I typically give a 3 strike ruling system. I warn them about something/delete the message. Then it's a time out for the next one, then a ban after that. There are exceptions of course, depending on the offense. Like that guy earlier, of course he was going to get banned for that after time out message.
[2022-12-08 18:20:13] <%nwmn420> @Blog_12345 yeah... imagine heyzeusEyes
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <%SilverWind19C> they don't like to admit they're wrong

[2022-12-08 18:35:02] <%$akaWrecks> Roguelike also randomizes the world around you on respawn.  Even roguelite isn't accurate since DS/ER doesn't have a majority of the concepts in those games like permadeath or random world generation.

[2022-12-08 18:38:14] <%$akaWrecks> Now that I think of it.  Imagine how insane that would be if Bloodborne was a true roguelike.  The entire world randomly generates every time you die.  When you die you spawn in the dream, and whatever you died with is how much you have to buff up.  Go back into the world and you have 0 echos and no consumables.

[2022-12-08 19:28:57] <KiNgPAin108> @heyzeusherestoast It's not a cool thing to do, but you can kill the merchants so that they drop their Bell Bearing to give the Twin Husks at Roundtable hold. Handy if you don't want to go back to an area and don't have Runes to buy everything (besides infinite stuff like arrows or whatever).

[2022-12-08 20:18:03] <%$MistaWenis> The other Fromsofts are paced in a way that helps you feel like you're really progressing. ER just has a higher curve/slower pace, I guess?

[2022-12-08 20:33:52] <@%MitchP1983> @Tensei_XV Welcome back to the stream! He put 200+ hours into this game on his first playthrough and loves it! This is the 3rd playthrough, he tried a 2nd one a few months back with dual whips, but didn't finish it!
[2022-12-08 20:33:53] <%Solemiargoylelan1> they nerfed him? why?

[2022-12-08 20:35:01] <%SilverWind19C> yeah they REALLY didn't need to tweak his HP, i hated it

[2022-12-08 20:35:25] <%$omegatron4128> after some stuff
[2022-12-08 20:35:25] <vincentmorelli> i think you need to beat radhan first
[2022-12-08 20:35:25] <%+KillJoyChef> after beating the boss
[2022-12-08 20:35:25] <%jetta_bunny> i think you can't do it until after this
[2022-12-08 20:35:26] <GSD1998> Made the fight less than what it should be
[2022-12-08 20:35:27] <%SilverWind19C> @heyZeusHeresToast some of his damage output, speed of his arrows, HP, and i think hitboxes
[2022-12-08 20:35:27] <%$noflowaction> Sleep again
[2022-12-08 20:35:28] <%+sheezybreezy> It's not a fight at night, it is a fight asnytime the festival isn't on

[2022-12-08 20:35:32] <%jetta_bunny> you can get it before this too i think
[2022-12-08 20:35:36] <%Dies24> @noflowaction you're wrong
[2022-12-08 20:35:37] <%$MsLatina> you did the side quest so the wolf guy killed the boss in there
[2022-12-08 20:35:38] <%$omegatron4128> the crucible and misbegotten fight
[2022-12-08 20:35:38] <+Kerrion_Sama> it's available eitheer before or after the festival
[2022-12-08 20:35:40] <%RubenSenna> There's a different boss before or after the festival
[2022-12-08 20:35:43] <%Jay7stone> Before if you get here too early like Cody
[2022-12-08 20:35:45] <+mr_hyde98> after or before but not during the quest from ranni

[2022-12-08 20:36:06] <%Sif_VI> Only before if you haven’t yet reached the Altus plateau
[2022-12-08 20:36:12] <%Jay7stone> After the ads
[2022-12-08 20:36:13] <%DuosLeo000> You went to Altus before this castle and pushed Radahn's quest.

[2022-12-08 20:36:15] <%RubenSenna> Yup

[2022-12-08 20:36:18] <%Blog_12345> you'll get it after. unavailable right now
[2022-12-08 20:36:18] <+TuckerLeigh> As long as the radahn festival isnt triggered you can get it
[2022-12-08 20:36:20] <Houdini303O> SeemsGood
[2022-12-08 20:36:28] <%SilverWind19C> yeah if you come here before reaching altus it's a boss in this arena
[2022-12-08 20:36:32] <%$noflowaction> @heyzeusherestoast you may to rest again
[2022-12-08 20:36:32] <%jetta_bunny> oh, supposedly Radahn is back to normal....?
[2022-12-08 20:36:36] <@%MitchP1983> @Tensei_XV It is something that he has some issue with, but overall does really like the game. He's just unfamiliar with it yet and is still trying to figure all the routes and where items are and such to speed things up a bit!

[2022-12-08 20:46:32] <+Kerrion_Sama> Elden ring devs might be right implying that the greatest warriors aren't all male characters with the maiden's presence at the festival. However they can't challenge the fact that the greatest warrior of all has a huge pp. And goes by the name of Zeus.

[2022-12-08 20:52:32] <vincentmorelli> yeah i wish they would have given radagon another phase and some more moves
[2022-12-08 20:52:36] <%+antonijoe> they thought they could do a bloodborne

[2022-12-08 20:53:00] <%$CharlesZane> The 1HP attack makes her pretty damn strong. It wont 1 shot the player but it does against other bosses.

[2022-12-08 20:53:46] <mike_helbret> Radagon and Elden Beast are just 2 shitty bosses
[2022-12-08 20:53:49] <sahaj67> bro after 400 hours i can confidently say that this game is shit and an absolute 10/10
[2022-12-08 20:53:55] <%+turtiebear> is there a way to turn on auto resub for prime? I don't use twitch but watch YouTube. whenever I remember I always resub.
[2022-12-08 20:53:56] <mike_helbret> (my opinion)
[2022-12-08 20:54:00] <glue_eater_69> it makes sense but the boss sucks
[2022-12-08 20:54:02] <%$omegatron4128> I was so op in ng+ it ruined the fight for sure
[2022-12-08 20:54:02] <ford9863> honestly elden beast would be 70% better if most of the fight wasn't running across a massive arena
[2022-12-08 20:54:03] <almightytitan> Dying to maliketh should technically end the game
[2022-12-08 20:54:04] <%+Ryan_FromCanada> I think that's a fairly lukewarm take. Definitely amongst the weakest final bosses
[2022-12-08 20:54:12] <%yuno_hoo> i love how it turns radagon into a sword
[2022-12-08 20:54:12] <sahaj67> i think you got hit
[2022-12-08 20:54:12] <%+f7lthy_megatron> Radagons tracking on his delayed attacks is ridiculous. Literally sticks to you lol
[2022-12-08 20:54:20] <LoranDarkstar> @mike_helbret Radagon is not shitty by any stretch of the imagination, but yea i guess its your opinion
[2022-12-08 20:54:23] <DaveH_uk> Could have made it a gimmick fight and have it before Radagon
[2022-12-08 20:54:25] <+roniersilva> I would make more sense if you fight Marika first and then fight Radagon

[2022-12-08 20:55:53] <%nwmn420> you beat him with a sock puppet last time though, that's the best thing anybody has ever done in this game, i don't care LUL
[2022-12-08 20:56:04] <DaveH_uk> Or would have been cool if there was a boss you only got to fight if you did a particular ending
[2022-12-08 20:56:38] <+Kerrion_Sama> Some kind of Radagon + Marika similar to the the twin princes dynamic in ds3 would have been the perfect ending boss
[2022-12-08 20:56:51] <DaveH_uk> Damn I forgot he used the sock puppet HA!
[2022-12-08 20:56:59] <%+antonijoe> did the horse just phase through the ground?

[2022-12-08 21:31:20] <%$justin6ix9> @mikezilla724 I’m saying for the price and performance it’s a good deal. A gaming pc or laptop that could outperform a PlayStation 5 would be a whole lot more money than $500
[2022-12-08 21:31:27] <%mebloscianka2115> i think I remember tuning into your stream couple of times in the span of couple of hours just to find you still attempting this boss the first time you fought it damn

[2022-12-08 21:39:04] <@%MitchP1983> @GDON1988 All his runs are. He doesn't use magic, summons and rarely fights on the horse. It's pretty much melee only.
[2022-12-08 21:39:06] <$herbal_kent> I love dodging that
[2022-12-08 21:39:17] <thefurtive_hunter> Oogway vs Radahn. Interesting
[2022-12-08 21:39:18] <%$CharlesZane> I think you can break his AI by turning around and walking away right at the start until he starts running around, and he wont shoot at you. That's what Dist does in speed runs.
[2022-12-08 21:39:20] <%+volf4321> @1Paxi1 tru, Elden Ring doesn't have any fans and nobody really has heard of the dark souls games LUL Kappa

[2022-12-08 21:39:53] <%$CharlesZane> Gets rid of the irritating part.
[2022-12-08 21:39:55] <DaveH_uk> There is a way to reset his aggro so he skips the arrow part and goes straight into melee. Iguess you prob rather not?
[2022-12-08 21:40:00] <$herbal_kent> No magic though
[2022-12-08 21:40:05] <ford9863> if those 3 days on Malenia didn't cause rage quits for Zeus nothing will

[2022-12-08 21:40:12] <%Zolton_theAirman> @CharlesZane it doesn't break the ai, it puts you far enough away to despawn him which sets him to melee mode
[2022-12-08 21:40:18] <@%MitchP1983> @mebloscianka2115 This would be the closest I've seen. https://clips.twitch.tv/FastSpookyBibimbapGingerPower

[2022-12-08 21:40:23] <%+rofpt03> i guess rage quitting is like letting your emotions dominate you

There’s supposed to be a new Star Wars game where Cal Kestis gets a blaster that no one asked for and that will be the highlight. If we are lucky we may get a Lies of P release date or Black Myth Wukong but everyone hoping for Elden Ring DLC is about to be really disappointed

[2022-12-08 23:21:44] <%$justin6ix9> @heyzeusherestoast if you want an animal weapon you get a beast Jaw that you can use that’s actually pretty good
[2022-12-08 23:21:50] <%+Minmatar0> Legacy dungeon is a hand crafte area with a major lore boss. its the closest to dark souls content ER has
[2022-12-08 23:21:50] <%+chaosemperordragoneote> I think 6 in total
[2022-12-08 23:21:54] <%sirbarlionel> Stormveil and the capital are much better imo ...the aesthetic is cool but the level design is lacking ..
