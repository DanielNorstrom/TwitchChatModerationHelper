[2022-12-17 05:27:16] <crazypromt> somebody asked this question already but I zoned out - what happened to the last fort? beasts?
[2022-12-17 05:27:35] <crazypromt> I see
[2022-12-17 05:27:36] <%TheOriginalFelord> you should be potioning
[2022-12-17 05:28:12] <%TheOriginalFelord> oh suprised Lakart hasnt been spamming it for weeks
[2022-12-17 05:28:20] <%TheOriginalFelord> potioncraft alchemist simulator its alot of fun
[2022-12-17 05:28:28] <%TheOriginalFelord> that checks out
[2022-12-17 05:29:10] <crazypromt> I don't think there's alchemy or magic in this game
[2022-12-17 05:29:22] <%TheOriginalFelord> fair enough
[2022-12-17 05:29:24] <crazypromt> imagine if there was magic in dd
[2022-12-17 05:29:32] <crazypromt> df
[2022-12-17 05:30:40] <%TheOriginalFelord> yeah not a fan of magic playthroughs generally
[2022-12-17 05:30:46] <%nickelVeneer> But psionics. Those slap
[2022-12-17 05:30:53] <crazypromt> but you would get some army of magic attacking your ass and turn dwarfs into piglets

[2022-12-17 05:32:05] <crazypromt> I wonder if there ever will be a moment where the development is done
[2022-12-17 05:32:19] <crazypromt> or will it go for another 18 years
[2022-12-17 05:32:34] <+SpaceGhost8> the version number corresponds to how far Tarn considers the game to be done
[2022-12-17 05:32:42] <$alpha_5h311> i would be all about magic if it was based on runes
[2022-12-17 05:32:54] <crazypromt> @spaceghost8 ih
[2022-12-17 05:32:57] <crazypromt> oh
[2022-12-17 05:33:27] <$alpha_5h311> so you could pull something like the magic door of moria
[2022-12-17 05:33:27] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-17 05:33:38] <$alpha_5h311> that's what you need runic magic for
[2022-12-17 05:34:14] <$alpha_5h311> so you can legit set a password for your fortress like in tolkien
[2022-12-17 05:34:49] <$alpha_5h311> im a moderate tolkien fanboy, i admit it
[2022-12-17 05:35:07] <$alpha_5h311> it would please *me* to see that in the game, that's why im floating the idea
[2022-12-17 05:35:17] <$alpha_5h311> totally not denying it
[2022-12-17 05:35:23] <+SpaceGhost8> i just joined, why is this level covered in water LUL

[2022-12-17 05:36:14] <crazypromt> I guess Richard is not a fan of Harry Potter then LUL
[2022-12-17 05:36:18] <styyygian> i mean, magic being overpowered makes sense though
[2022-12-17 05:36:26] <%$kuakae> rimworld psychic powers? kind of like magic and okayish balanced imo
[2022-12-17 05:36:34] <%TheOriginalFelord> more shit no one ever uses
[2022-12-17 05:36:46] <$alpha_5h311> totally down with more mechanics too
[2022-12-17 05:37:18] <styyygian> what, you dont like a good chunk skip?
[2022-12-17 05:37:46] <%K9kroz> richBobble
[2022-12-17 05:37:56] <%$kuakae> yeah fair. there are indeed quite some useless ones. bit also useful yet not op ones imo
[2022-12-17 05:38:06] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> chat, how come there is a term for simultaneous oral sex but not for simultaneous fingering?
[2022-12-17 05:38:24] <styyygian> mutual masturbation
[2022-12-17 05:38:24] <crazypromt> Richard I started following you since the Isaac speed run championship
[2022-12-17 05:38:32] <crazypromt> those were the times
[2022-12-17 05:38:39] <%K9kroz> im down
[2022-12-17 05:38:40] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> what?
[2022-12-17 05:38:43] <%K9kroz> what
[2022-12-17 05:38:46] <+SpaceGhost8> circle jerk
[2022-12-17 05:38:48] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> thats just two people jerking off in a room together
[2022-12-17 05:39:03] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> I specifically said fingering
[2022-12-17 05:39:10] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> as in, you finger a girl and she fingers you
[2022-12-17 05:39:17] <%K9kroz> @blazeit69YOLOswag lets try it and come up with a term
[2022-12-17 05:39:32] <%+12yno> i'd rather her finger me and me not have to reciprocate
[2022-12-17 05:39:39] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> nah dog, masturbation is when you do it to yourself
[2022-12-17 05:39:40] <Ruinkind> I dunno, M/F mutual fingering is kinda unique.
[2022-12-17 05:39:56] <bdres> nice, the cavern outpost is still going
[2022-12-17 05:40:02] <Ruinkind> I usually don't get my butthole fingered.
[2022-12-17 05:40:02] <@%MiniKatalyst> if theres an arousal its masturbation, touching your own nipples count
[2022-12-17 05:40:02] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> how the fuck is it unique?
[2022-12-17 05:40:03] <%K9kroz> what about m/m
[2022-12-17 05:40:19] <Ruinkind> I think it should have a special name.
[2022-12-17 05:40:28] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> not gonna lie, I havent got a side. I just wanted to spice the chat up
[2022-12-17 05:40:39] <%K9kroz> sure bro
[2022-12-17 05:40:46] <crazypromt> Interfingering
[2022-12-17 05:40:53] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> ok
[2022-12-17 05:40:53] <+SpaceGhost8> m/m fingering
[2022-12-17 05:41:02] <%+12yno> if their fingers aren't girthy, it's a no go
[2022-12-17 05:41:08] <%K9kroz> m&m
[2022-12-17 05:41:10] <bdres> the water floor is new. thats a nice touch
[2022-12-17 05:41:35] <PAEforever> m/m like one of those finger traps?
[2022-12-17 05:41:37] <bdres> I just lost 30 people to a bar fight sadge
[2022-12-17 05:41:45] <Ruinkind> Why do we gotta call 69 69in' then?!  That is just masturbation with your mouth.
[2022-12-17 05:41:47] <styyygian> the definition on google is "stimulation of the genitals with the hand for sexual pleasure"
[2022-12-17 05:41:57] <%$kuakae> the question is, if a man fingering his butt can be called masturbation
[2022-12-17 05:41:58] <styyygian> no mention that it has to be your hand
[2022-12-17 05:42:00] <%$vidarr__> i just thought you had an overly enthusiastic mop dwarf

[2022-12-17 05:42:17] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> @kuakae your ass hole isnt a genital. Therefore I'd say no

[2022-12-17 05:42:47] <styyygian> what about the prostate
[2022-12-17 05:42:53] <%+12yno> @kuakae an asshole is simply genital storage
[2022-12-17 05:42:54] <%K9kroz> what aboutit
[2022-12-17 05:43:00] <crazypromt> what about it NotLikeThis
[2022-12-17 05:43:09] <+SpaceGhost8> still scared of birds
[2022-12-17 05:43:30] <%$kuakae> @blazeit69yoloswag yeah im with you on that. although would you then say if someone had anal sex, only the one who had a genital involved actually had sex?

[2022-12-17 05:50:37] <%$PrismaticDuck> I think I remember like 15 years ago, when I was learning DF that people said that's why you don't want to build on an aquifer. I don't think I was smart enough to figure out why

[2022-12-17 06:19:42] <%DruggedYak> My friend told me he ended up with drunk cats in this game cause they walked through fermented/spoiled goods and then cleaned themselves
[2022-12-17 06:20:02] <%DruggedYak> nah
[2022-12-17 06:20:14] <%DruggedYak> he might have told me the truth, but I wasn't listening that closely
[2022-12-17 06:20:41] <bdres> cats dont get drunk in the steam version

[2022-12-17 06:21:29] <%DruggedYak> Still an absurd level of detail and system interaction
[2022-12-17 06:21:47] <+davidlecl> i think it was just that cats licked their paws
[2022-12-17 06:22:03] <+davidlecl> i don't think it was a bug per se
[2022-12-17 06:22:27] <%zinix5> In the no clip doc they talked about how every time they licked their paws it counted as a full mug of ale
[2022-12-17 06:22:58] <%DruggedYak> That's one hell of a foot

[2022-12-17 06:25:45] <+davidlecl> i think if that tile wasn't in the corner it would help

[2022-12-17 06:26:19] <+davidlecl> so that it had 7 tiles to spread into
[2022-12-17 06:26:28] <%DruggedYak> Yeah. Water doesn't compress well

[2022-12-17 06:27:22] <hypatian_kat> Do a diagonal wall pressure reduction step at the top, maybe?
[2022-12-17 06:27:40] <+davidlecl> I think move the wall to the right and then make the south outflows 4 tiles
[2022-12-17 06:27:42] <hypatian_kat> Moist Fortress.
[2022-12-17 06:27:44] <ItsSplendid> the cats seem to be having fun int he water

[2022-12-17 06:39:43] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I wonder if you could pump it off the map 🤔
[2022-12-17 06:39:49] <+curry_murmurs> Fluid will drain off the map *if* the last tile at the edge is a fortification. You can set up drainage systems that way.

[2022-12-17 06:41:47] <$Zanoxis> this game seems incredibly complex...even more so than the other games like it. do you like it about the same? (I know this is an older game)
[2022-12-17 06:41:59] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I came here to learn what you do because my fortress is a disaster after I've hit 50+ dwarves richFine
[2022-12-17 06:42:22] <%SkyLineAce> the games age has nothing to do with anything. It's a great game imo, and holds up pretty much to any other game
[2022-12-17 06:42:30] <rty275> there is no dwarf fortress but dwarf fortress
[2022-12-17 06:42:39] <DavieDonna> How does RimWorld compare to this game?
[2022-12-17 06:42:44] <bdres> you just have a different bar for spoilers than anyone else, tbh. ppl in chat just think they're describing mechanics
[2022-12-17 06:43:00] <NotMiniMe> what is 1, 6-7? is it depth?
[2022-12-17 06:43:02] <$Zanoxis> ya know....I'm high and I probably could've phrased that question better

[2022-12-17 07:19:30] <%rty275> a warm warning, a warmning if you will
[2022-12-17 07:20:49] <%EpicPumaNess> just mine into the lava and let it sort itself out richLUL
[2022-12-17 07:21:23] <TheKanAry> I’ve never heard of too deep or too greedy before, myself.
[2022-12-17 07:21:32] <Daenerys9595> what's the Main goal of the Game? i just started to play 1 hr ago and i'm kinda lost
[2022-12-17 07:21:57] <%rty275> i think this dwarf is dead
[2022-12-17 07:22:01] <%$nohamtaB> live and then lose at some point
[2022-12-17 07:22:36] <%EpicPumaNess> or reach lag death
[2022-12-17 07:22:56] <%Sycon89> hey @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-17 07:23:27] <%$nohamtaB> alright... guess im gonna go lay down and wait for this 3d print to finish up before actually sleeping
[2022-12-17 07:23:31] <%$nohamtaB> have a good night all
[2022-12-17 07:24:03] <%EpicPumaNess> night nohamtab
[2022-12-17 07:25:14] <+davidlecl> I guess the "goal" is to become a mountainhome
[2022-12-17 07:25:23] <+davidlecl> or find adamantium
[2022-12-17 07:25:45] <!%Calastigro> one reason i like a vape with removable 18650 batteries
[2022-12-17 07:25:49] <%EpicPumaNess> goal is honestly whatever you want it to be, it seems
[2022-12-17 07:25:54] <!%Calastigro> they only last a few hundred charges
[2022-12-17 07:26:09] <IsAnElement> yeah i have so many ideas for dwarf forts once im done with my current
[2022-12-17 07:26:35] <!%Calastigro> yeah, i'm saying you need like 2 every year or so
[2022-12-17 07:27:00] <%+dilupus> @Daenerys9595 The goal is to have FUN. FUN, in this case, being to lose memorably. It's been the Dwarf Fortress community's goal for the past 20 years
[2022-12-17 07:27:05] <!%Calastigro> huh, i'm vaping all day, don't replace mine more often than that
[2022-12-17 07:27:51] <!%Calastigro> does your charger have a screen? is it a 500mA or 1000mA charger?
[2022-12-17 07:28:14] <wzrdn> don't leave a full battery on the charger. trickle charge without software protection kills batteries.
[2022-12-17 07:28:33] <!%Calastigro> better chargers won't do that as bad, but yeah
[2022-12-17 07:28:40] <tipereth6> that is true, it will lower its total threshold
[2022-12-17 07:28:48] <!%Calastigro> also vapes will discharge batteries way more than they should be

[2022-12-17 07:28:57] <+Karmiini> mining adamantine was fun, I didn't get to use it though
[2022-12-17 07:29:03] <tipereth6> that cat lol!
[2022-12-17 07:29:07] <wzrdn> yes I absolutely understand. just saying if you find a good spot during the day when you are awake, see the battery is charged, pull it
[2022-12-17 07:29:19] <!%Calastigro> if you wanna be kind to a vape battery, you charge it when the vape says like 30%, at least the way mine reads
[2022-12-17 07:29:44] <+DrJonez> is it possible to fill a well up with buckets or is that too slow? i feel like the water would evaporate before they could fill it up
[2022-12-17 07:29:44] <wzrdn> expensive products will include a top-off protection feature
[2022-12-17 07:30:39] <IsAnElement> you can make 4 overlapping dumping zones
[2022-12-17 07:30:43] <wzrdn> if the pond is small enough you can fill a bucket with a pond
[2022-12-17 07:30:53] <IsAnElement> have a dwarf dumping from each side
[2022-12-17 07:31:05] <+DrJonez> I've got a well that's 1x1 and like 5 deep in my hospital that I want to fill just for the doctors to wash up with
[2022-12-17 07:31:08] <!%Calastigro> lithium cells are tricky, like, when you've just been using them, the voltage is lower, if you want to be kinder to a vape battery you've just killed, you won't put it on the charger right away, you'll wait an hour or so for it to recover somewhat from being used before you charge it
[2022-12-17 07:31:57] <%DrTaru> New run? Did the performance get unbearable?
[2022-12-17 07:32:39] <chase_alakai_cruz> lol

[2022-12-17 07:37:18] <Jebediah_xD> Use ramps to make a pool like structure
[2022-12-17 07:37:51] <+DoubleNutz> dont go chasing waterfalls
[2022-12-17 07:38:19] <wzrdn> just stick too the massive lava lakes that you're used to, oooosed to
[2022-12-17 07:38:26] <JohnDoeRadio> i did the same.  also lost half my dwarves cause they went to the edge of the canal i dug way too deep almost at the same time and fell in for some ungodly unknown reason

[2022-12-17 07:47:45] <Trisgrand> so is this a reskin of the original? I never played the original
[2022-12-17 07:48:15] <Trisgrand> I see
[2022-12-17 07:48:31] <%+Cynder_Dragon> It does have some mechanical differences from the classic, so I've heard.
[2022-12-17 07:49:18] <%+Cynder_Dragon> People told me that the creator said he's like, 42% done. LUL
[2022-12-17 07:49:22] <%mitcheell> like the oprgeon trail game on mac ion the mid 90'd

[2022-12-17 07:54:16] <Pestimism> The dwarves saw Avatar 2 and got inspired

[2022-12-17 07:55:43] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Sure it has nothing to do wih the flooding
[2022-12-17 07:55:43] <gump_rump> you've ran out of water deposit space
[2022-12-17 07:56:32] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Are you trying to redirect the river?
[2022-12-17 07:57:15] <%$Naoma10> a mod to tell me my order zone dimensions rimworld style would be sick
[2022-12-17 07:57:33] <+Anerisa> making the dwarves a lazy river.
[2022-12-17 07:57:49] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Never done that before might make mine a little water fall

[2022-12-17 07:58:18] <Heavy509> i wish you could do a large 3x3 stairwell instead of 9 little holes

[2022-12-17 08:06:51] <%$Naoma10> with all of these glass walls and water we're making a dwarf aquarium

[2022-12-17 08:08:00] <veerce> hi, i haven't played DF but played all other games. How much micromanage do the dwarves need
[2022-12-17 08:08:20] <@%Shiverwarp> That's impressive
[2022-12-17 08:08:25] <veerce> yes

[2022-12-17 08:08:34] <@%Shiverwarp> It will be your test
[2022-12-17 08:08:38] <NTguilty25> played all other games GIGACHAD
[2022-12-17 08:09:31] <%$eSaltcracker> can you not make an area and force him to be there? or how to those work?
[2022-12-17 08:09:32] <veerce> ok cool. yeah the micro control was annoying to me in rimworld
[2022-12-17 08:09:36] <%rty275> no you can't micro them, macro is stuff like building designations
[2022-12-17 08:09:38] <!%Calastigro> it's more that you can't micro them in DF
[2022-12-17 08:10:00] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I want priority job designations. DF is hard not having it
[2022-12-17 08:10:03] <%$Naoma10> I really enjoy the door into the future aquarium what could go wrong

[2022-12-17 08:23:10] <bdres> i just found out menthols are illegal in 2023 so every store is dumping their supply at cost
[2022-12-17 08:23:19] <+punchingKirby> right in a chasm by a rievr
[2022-12-17 08:23:46] <%K9kroz> Do you ever restart for map rng
[2022-12-17 08:25:38] <%$Naoma10> this fort is already looking moist I love it

[2022-12-17 08:28:01] <ReformingOne> oh new fort??
[2022-12-17 08:28:12] <%+Usinji> I'm actually impressed by the amount of terrifying creatures they have in the game.
[2022-12-17 08:28:13] <%SkyLineAce> old fort got taxed by the raven gods too hard
[2022-12-17 08:29:20] <%+Cynder_Dragon> He's setting enemies to hard so the game must be making everything giant LUL

[2022-12-17 08:35:46] <%GoRibGo> Right on, at least it wasnt save file corruption haha
[2022-12-17 08:37:35] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I've only had DF crash a couple times following a save, but the saves were successful.
[2022-12-17 08:38:10] <%GoRibGo> I just lost mine :( file compression is now turned off lol
[2022-12-17 08:38:15] <bdres> Ive never had df crash. I'm either doing something right or something wrong
[2022-12-17 08:39:01] <%GoRibGo> mine crashed on load, even older saves. 25ish hours, was sad
[2022-12-17 08:39:01] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Yeah turning off file compression helps with the save time. I'm not sure how large save files get
[2022-12-17 08:39:32] <%Kardmager> Maybe giant squirrel vs Giant raven fight?
[2022-12-17 08:39:55] <%hottiefruits> i guess ravens are the dominant species on this planet
[2022-12-17 08:41:39] <pipja> Is this the Giant Ravens fort or another new one?

[2022-12-17 09:07:19] <!%Calastigro> i wouldn't say so
[2022-12-17 09:07:49] <bdres> i feel like dumping water into water fucks fps

[2022-12-17 09:09:55] <!%+krainboltgreene> True.
[2022-12-17 09:10:18] <Quaigon_Twitch> that depends on the definition for "wet" that you use
[2022-12-17 09:10:49] <!%+krainboltgreene> Oh this is an entirely new castle.
[2022-12-17 09:18:50] <!%+krainboltgreene> Okay I did the research, Richard do you want to know about stair effiency?

[2022-12-17 09:27:17] <Just_Emotes> Chat, does he run any mods?
[2022-12-17 09:27:49] <!%+krainboltgreene> Most of the old mods should work as it's the same underlying engine.
[2022-12-17 09:28:06] <bdres> mod scene is surprisingly weak rn. dunno if they got the tools they need to do really cool stuff
[2022-12-17 09:28:24] <Just_Emotes> yeah, there's a few out already lol

[2022-12-17 09:43:21] <%Svengineer> I did order snow. did they get the gift wrap right?
[2022-12-17 09:44:40] <%GoRibGo> I really dig this up top area
[2022-12-17 09:45:28] <!%+krainboltgreene> I got a legendary gelder the other day, freak.
[2022-12-17 09:46:59] <+NullpointerGames> so Richards been playing this for like w week right? how much of it is still a baffling mystery?
[2022-12-17 09:48:05] <!%Calastigro> i hope even expert players have baffling mysteries happen occasionally when they play

[2022-12-17 09:50:42] <!%Calastigro> i'm remembering the hole in the side of the garage Dick used to threaten to put a funnel in
[2022-12-17 09:50:54] <!%Calastigro> but then that would've eaten into the yard pissing
[2022-12-17 09:50:59] <ShadowsparksTV> No, I mean get up and go to the bathroom and take pity on your bladder.
[2022-12-17 09:51:25] <!%Calastigro> did they tack on a .5 bath for that LUL
[2022-12-17 09:51:31] <+nickaka_> so i accidentally caged my local roc and now it's semi-wild. How should i go about chcaining?
[2022-12-17 09:52:41] <the_Being> good morning!
[2022-12-17 09:52:48] <the_Being> what's the project?
[2022-12-17 09:53:49] <Kai_TVz> This game seems complicated
[2022-12-17 09:54:03] <!%Calastigro> the goal? strike the earth
[2022-12-17 09:54:18] <bdres> dwarves? happy? not possible
[2022-12-17 09:54:20] <$titanodin> This a jelly mine?
[2022-12-17 09:54:36] <the_Being> so this is stairway past giant cavern for more mining in the depths where nothing could go wrong?
[2022-12-17 09:55:33] <!%Calastigro> nothing sinister could be lurking in the depths if Dick gets there and lurks first
[2022-12-17 09:56:53] <!%Calastigro> this game doesn't have steam achievements, does it?
[2022-12-17 09:57:21] <the_Being> I'm going to guess those come later
[2022-12-17 09:57:29] <!%Calastigro> that'd be giving the player too much direction LUL
[2022-12-17 09:57:34] <+punchingKirby> how's our waterfall coming along?
[2022-12-17 09:57:59] <+punchingKirby> yeah
[2022-12-17 09:58:07] <+punchingKirby> no need to fuss over flood gates right now
[2022-12-17 09:58:15] <!%Calastigro> here's hoping spring comes just at the wrong moment
[2022-12-17 09:58:25] <+punchingKirby> that'd be hilarious
[2022-12-17 09:59:02] <ugahbuga> ayooo
[2022-12-17 09:59:08] <the_Being> already frozen mid-autumn danHmm
[2022-12-17 09:59:31] <+punchingKirby> i reckon its going to get super cold in winter
[2022-12-17 09:59:37] <!%Calastigro> i like to joke that Dark Souls games have advanced hubris detection algorithms, but really, this game does very well on that front too
[2022-12-17 09:59:52] <+BazzaroPlays> why the grates and extra holes, why not just stairs?

[2022-12-17 09:59:52] <bdres> dwarves live on the edge
[2022-12-17 09:59:57] <bdres> (of death)
[2022-12-17 10:00:07] <the_Being> (of sanity)

[2022-12-17 10:00:29] <!%Calastigro> @BazzaroPlays i think he needed the drainage earlier?
[2022-12-17 10:00:33] <+punchingKirby> dwarffortress is really good at finding elaborate plans, that have tiny flaws, and make you pay
[2022-12-17 10:01:41] <%AOnceWiseSage> waterfall madness richS
[2022-12-17 10:02:22] <!%Calastigro> how tall does a waterfall have to be to be fully satusfying?
[2022-12-17 10:02:53] <+punchingKirby> i wonder
[2022-12-17 10:02:56] <!%Calastigro> but like, does a 1 tall waterfall even mist much?
[2022-12-17 10:03:01] <+punchingKirby> could you make a cascading waterfall?
[2022-12-17 10:03:08] <+punchingKirby> like, have it steps?
[2022-12-17 10:03:17] <bdres> they like falling water but falling water also outputs a mist they like too
[2022-12-17 10:03:39] <bdres> but they hate rain for some reason
[2022-12-17 10:03:39] <the_Being> it's because they never shower
[2022-12-17 10:03:48] <Pestimism> Could you make a stretch of 1 z level drops and have mist on every level? Sounds sick
[2022-12-17 10:04:30] <the_Being> ...is it possible to make a spiral waterfall?
[2022-12-17 10:04:31] <Pestimism> Oh really? I didn't know that, guess I know what to do in my next fort
[2022-12-17 10:05:14] <+punchingKirby> i wish rimworld could properly support z levels
[2022-12-17 10:05:29] <flashyn> !please

[2022-12-17 10:26:54] <%Convectt> like that touch the stove thing
[2022-12-17 10:27:15] <%Convectt> just fall and break your legs so you know it is bad for you
[2022-12-17 10:28:43] <!%Calastigro> do dwarves still enjoy being misted when it's cold? or do they just get pneumonia and die or whatever
[2022-12-17 10:30:04] <!%Calastigro> speaking of dying of pneumonia, that new oregon trail game actually looks real good
[2022-12-17 10:30:28] <!%Calastigro> and i like that they mention dying of dysentery like 3 times in the description
[2022-12-17 10:30:34] <!%Calastigro> no, it's an official remake

[2022-12-17 10:43:40] <%EpicPumaNess> with a warm misting waterfall?
[2022-12-17 10:43:49] <!%Calastigro> sounds heavenly
[2022-12-17 10:44:33] <!%Calastigro> nah, just make the baths like 1-2 z levels above the magma

[2022-12-17 10:45:32] <%EpicPumaNess> The Japanese have got it right, shower real quick then soak in a hot tub
[2022-12-17 10:45:47] <%Polkaderp> I do it the other way
[2022-12-17 10:45:54] <%EpicPumaNess> hot tub/hot spring*
[2022-12-17 10:46:00] <%Polkaderp> Sit in filth and then shower, it works for pots/pans
[2022-12-17 10:46:11] <%EpicPumaNess> touche
[2022-12-17 10:46:40] <!%Calastigro> i think the order depends on whether its a communal bath
[2022-12-17 10:47:19] <%Polkaderp> That makes sense
[2022-12-17 10:47:33] <%EpicPumaNess> Its actually cold here in Texas right now, (not super cold mind you 39F) so a hot bath actualyl sounds super nice
[2022-12-17 10:47:50] <%Polkaderp> Hot baths are real good
[2022-12-17 10:48:01] <!%Calastigro> hot tubs when it's snowing? hcjSpicy
[2022-12-17 10:48:17] <%Polkaderp> Apparently having it too hot can damage your sperm, so if you're tryin' to just fuck, take baths

[2022-12-17 10:51:25] <Topken> I try and stay far away from that side of twitch
[2022-12-17 10:51:51] <%Lakart> @Calastigro The twitch hot tub meta was streaming from a tub, not streaming FOR a tub.
[2022-12-17 10:52:11] <!%Calastigro> dick reinventing the game, while inventing it
[2022-12-17 10:52:47] <%AnxietyPrime> if you stream from the tub can you write the tub off as a business expense
[2022-12-17 10:53:13] <!%Calastigro> i'm imagining someone starting out hot tub streaming from a little wooden barrel and upgrading incrementally over time

[2022-12-17 11:18:54] <%$kuakae> i wonder if you could have water near lava so it doesnt freeze and just cycle that around for your waterfall
[2022-12-17 11:20:40] <%$kuakae> yeah but you could use the 1 month of thawed water to refill it. also you need stuff to keep you occupied

[2022-12-17 12:09:35] <Ghulmeister> my first fort died because of dehydration because i wasnt prepared for winter
[2022-12-17 12:09:39] <+Azawrath> Hey Dick, Hey Chat... hows the new fort?
[2022-12-17 12:09:39] <+ChromeViper> LUL
[2022-12-17 12:09:50] <SkinkyIsKinky> yeah i love long games, skyrim is gold never ending almost man, and then mods
[2022-12-17 12:09:52] <Keyll> waterfalls are awesome so thats fair
[2022-12-17 12:10:01] <+GlitchHound> don't go making waterfalls... stick to... something I'm out
[2022-12-17 12:10:13] <Hatback> right now im dealing witha problem where my military assigned dwarves are not equipping armor even though the assignment says always on, replace clothing, and I have all the armor in storage
[2022-12-17 12:10:14] <+Azawrath> wtf we so deep
[2022-12-17 12:10:18] <Hatback> no clue why
[2022-12-17 12:10:33] <Mikxox> Its about how fun the learning is I guess, will deff be getting this when I have some free time
[2022-12-17 12:10:33] <snocade> waterfall fort probably next thing i try, water is super weird to me in this game
[2022-12-17 12:10:42] <Hatback> schedule
[2022-12-17 12:10:55] <+Azawrath> edit the off duty
[2022-12-17 12:10:59] <Hatback> equip/aalways
[2022-12-17 12:11:00] <Hatback> that one
[2022-12-17 12:11:00] <Spiderpheonix> No but that 60hrs might take you 1-2 weeks, but it would take me about 4 months. But no I wasn’t complaining.. I’m enjoying watching
[2022-12-17 12:11:20] <RizTheWizard> @Hatback I was having that problem earlier. it fixed itself when the squad went off duty, then back on duty
[2022-12-17 12:11:22] <Hatback> and some of them are following it, some of them arent
[2022-12-17 12:11:27] <Hatback> interesting
[2022-12-17 12:11:44] <sGenalol> !please
[2022-12-17 12:11:44] <@^Moobot> @sGenalol Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-17 12:11:44] <RizTheWizard> though I didn't do it by hand, I just decided to ignore it and it fixed itself after like 4 months lol
[2022-12-17 12:11:52] <+Azawrath> you oftenneed to edit the off duty setting so they don't take it off when not doing stuff
[2022-12-17 12:12:03] <Hatback> maybe i just needto take it off duty and put it back
[2022-12-17 12:12:05] <Hatback> ill try it I suppose
[2022-12-17 12:12:25] <Keyll> @Hatback turning it off and on does fix a lot of things in life
[2022-12-17 12:12:29] <InSaneITrust> did you assign the uniform/armor to all squads? @Hatback
[2022-12-17 12:13:20] <+hexez> Is this the "The Hills Have Eyes" colony
[2022-12-17 12:13:58] <+MabiusMaximus> !please
[2022-12-17 12:13:58] <@^Moobot> @MabiusMaximus Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.

[2022-12-17 12:25:16] <the_Being> there's a surprising amount of water LUL
[2022-12-17 12:25:42] <the_Being> yeah but you can't judge how much flow the river has, just see it's 7 7 7 7 7 depth :P
[2022-12-17 12:26:51] <+GlitchHound> I love how Dick's gone and manufactured a waterfall through his whole base, meanwhile I spent hours generating worlds and selecting embark points to have a waterfall to build my base around
[2022-12-17 12:28:01] <+GlitchHound> Yeah, that too - I start at 12 and haven't hit 0 yet lul
[2022-12-17 12:28:42] <+GlitchHound> My plan is to build a megadam

[2022-12-17 12:33:45] <the_Being> what if you move tradepost next to waterfall so they can see it and spread the word?
[2022-12-17 12:33:52] <the_Being> (no idea if that's a mechanic, but this is DF...)
