[2023-01-05 00:01:51] <%AncientCapitals> Tbh that is how ppl interpret things like that unless ppl get you to elaborate
[2023-01-05 00:01:53] <naujokas3> thats what i did with clown i did gate 1-2
[2023-01-05 00:01:57] <naujokas3> just struggled with 3
[2023-01-05 00:02:05] <@%ragingqueen666> thats true and if you make 1 mystake youre getting scream at by everyone
[2023-01-05 00:02:07] <@%ragingqueen666> or just kick
[2023-01-05 00:02:19] <%+UnzipsRS> QWUEEEEEN PeepoShy
[2023-01-05 00:02:33] <%+Energylegs> lol yeah the first time i forgot about argos p3 wipe, so much hate
[2023-01-05 00:03:13] <%+Energylegs> but thats just random pugs too. Idk how to find a static, but that just seems to be where ppl really enjoy this
[2023-01-05 00:03:16] <%givemebeer_> deadeye books are one to stash in the hopes that they go up when engraving inevitably gets revamped

[2023-01-05 00:03:32] <+klone_iron_fist> If you feel you are getting gate kept by roster level, easy, push roster level fro a week and miss that weeks raids, big deal. Patience.
[2023-01-05 00:03:48] <+klone_iron_fist> Also, I can't even make fun of you for failing a typing test.
[2023-01-05 00:04:01] <@%ragingqueen666> so a break ?
[2023-01-05 00:04:02] <+dylanlikespie4> peepoDJ
[2023-01-05 00:04:08] <%+UnzipsRS> just make ur own group 5Head
[2023-01-05 00:04:09] <naujokas3> but i dont have time or dont really wanna play more than 1 character
[2023-01-05 00:04:13] <naujokas3> so  everyone is diffrent
[2023-01-05 00:04:14] <%givemebeer_> or just do your weeklies and it will come
[2023-01-05 00:04:29] <+klone_iron_fist> @naujokas3 you can't do the time, then you don't get the pie
[2023-01-05 00:04:35] <+klone_iron_fist> that's what the game is
[2023-01-05 00:04:37] <@%ragingqueen666> same! I cant list until 6 am Smadge
[2023-01-05 00:04:45] <@%ragingqueen666> wanna do cube and boss rush ?
[2023-01-05 00:04:51] <@%ragingqueen666> I invite you and start it
[2023-01-05 00:05:20] <%AncientCapitals> I mean the difference is ppl that played from the start did it before there was 3x legion raids per characters + everything else that they added on top, when island souls and guardians was the only content to be done i can understand that ppl did that ^^
[2023-01-05 00:05:21] VIEWERS: 643
[2023-01-05 00:05:29] <%+UnzipsRS> if u have secret maps do them
[2023-01-05 00:05:32] <%givemebeer_> 2x boss rush weekly is incredible roster level juice for something very quick and valuable
[2023-01-05 00:05:33] <%+UnzipsRS> 1k roster xp per map KEKW
[2023-01-05 00:05:45] <@%ragingqueen666> baby
[2023-01-05 00:06:12] <%+UnzipsRS> yeah i think some give more than that too
[2023-01-05 00:06:18] <+TheJuan> im a "horizontal" andy
[2023-01-05 00:06:26] <%+Arwya0203> you going for more raids?
[2023-01-05 00:06:29] <+TheJuan> coz i enjoy that part of the game
[2023-01-05 00:06:34] <%+Arwya0203> my wow group is done for today :(
[2023-01-05 00:06:35] <naujokas3> i just rapport dropped nia in punika for omnium :D

[2023-01-05 00:07:02] <%givemebeer_> @naujokas3 nia rapport bomb was so monkaS
[2023-01-05 00:07:11] <@%ragingqueen666> dont forget you weeklys
[2023-01-05 00:07:14] <+klone_iron_fist> as long as you are having fun it doesn't matter what part of the game you have fun in, that's what it is, a game for fun :)

[2023-01-05 00:07:36] <naujokas3> it was easy i had 3 relic
[2023-01-05 00:07:49] <+klone_iron_fist> does Nia still have the skip?
[2023-01-05 00:07:52] <naujokas3> 200 blue crystal now for relic and 3 legendaries
[2023-01-05 00:07:59] <naujokas3> you can get 2 a week now
[2023-01-05 00:08:05] <%+UnzipsRS> we have bots to do that for us Kappa
[2023-01-05 00:08:05] <@%^Streamlabs> bakeTroll
[2023-01-05 00:08:25] <naujokas3> relic rapport and 3 legendaries or 2
[2023-01-05 00:08:30] <naujokas3> and you can get 2 of em a week
[2023-01-05 00:08:34] <naujokas3> its good foor rapport
[2023-01-05 00:08:49] <%Maus3r> without bots ppl would be monakS ing about fusion prices
[2023-01-05 00:08:54] <naujokas3> i just did it for omnium
[2023-01-05 00:08:55] <%AncientCapitals> i would love for the horizontal content not to be shit but it is so its a literal pain to do, my goal is to do as little as humanly possible to get what i need for raiding.
[2023-01-05 00:08:58] <naujokas3> im only 1 away now
[2023-01-05 00:09:22] <%+Energylegs> is there a use for daily rapport if you have everyone maxed out?
[2023-01-05 00:09:25] VIEWERS: 661
[2023-01-05 00:09:26] <%Maus3r> think fish would go up by more than 500%
[2023-01-05 00:09:53] <%AncientCapitals> fish would skyrocket without bots which would mean a prob 5x maybe 10x price for fusion materials
[2023-01-05 00:09:54] <+TheJuan> if we would get silver by doing life skills
[2023-01-05 00:10:02] <+TheJuan> ppl will be doing that 24/7

[2023-01-05 00:35:32] <%AncientCapitals> look the crafting system is so basic in this game so its literally piss easy to figure out. I play alot of eve online and in that game the production is literally complex as hell. every factor is known. The spreadsheet is like 3 lines
[2023-01-05 00:35:34] <%+Arwya0203> @hoodidupeh since when mod? naguuraThinking
[2023-01-05 00:35:44] <+Ralir> i usually see people say that Global got scammed, like KR community said there would be big gold gains with Brel coming
[2023-01-05 00:35:44] <+mxsy> as i said, he made 10k, but the listing limit is now fuckin fusion sellers
[2023-01-05 00:35:51] <+Ralir> did that not happen?
[2023-01-05 00:35:53] <+mxsy> all i wanted to get across initially
[2023-01-05 00:35:58] <+mxsy> lets leave it at that
[2023-01-05 00:36:00] <+Ralir> like, economy went sideways
[2023-01-05 00:36:02] <@%hoodidupeh> @hoodidupeh told baker how to craft orehas, got a promotion that way
[2023-01-05 00:36:21] <%+UnzipsRS> i dont think its a touchy topic its more the fact that it isn't really rocket science every1 who plays the game im pretty sure is doing the same as your friend, there's nothing secret about that so u shouldn't have to feel like u have to keep his secret
[2023-01-05 00:36:35] <%Kwadrat_> can we allready scream "they took our job" or its too soon?
[2023-01-05 00:36:51] <@%ragingqueen666> @UnzipsRS dude am pretty sure the brel rush is done PauseChamp
[2023-01-05 00:36:55] <+plankturtle> yeah i think it's pretty simple
[2023-01-05 00:37:20] <%AncientCapitals> It takes you 3 minutes to make a spreadsheet for this

[2023-01-05 00:39:53] <%+Energylegs> i have just been crafting the special ones from farm. is that bad?
[2023-01-05 00:39:53] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.

[2023-01-05 00:40:07] <+Ralir> my only income of fusion mats is from farm-excavating, for personal use that is
[2023-01-05 00:40:11] <+TheJuan> i see it as a saving method
[2023-01-05 00:40:20] <%Maus3r> at 10g if you chaincraft i think its about 6k / day
[2023-01-05 00:40:24] <+Ralir> yeah
[2023-01-05 00:40:34] <+mxsy> well, he said he is making 3-4 stacks a day, excluding bonus crafts
[2023-01-05 00:40:45] <%Maus3r> yes
[2023-01-05 00:40:48] <+mxsy> maybe he used acceleration stuff
[2023-01-05 00:40:59] <@%hoodidupeh> prolly 6-7h
[2023-01-05 00:41:15] <+Ralir> i am sure there's someone out there that uses bc to accelerate KEKWait
[2023-01-05 00:41:24] <%Maus3r> you prolly do 100 crafts if you afk vs 130~ if you dont have downtime

[2023-01-05 00:41:41] <@%hoodidupeh> however is 10k even much if he crafts all day
[2023-01-05 00:41:45] <%Kwadrat_> its more and more like i have girlfriend but in another school KEKW
[2023-01-05 00:42:02] <+Ralir> how did that happen tho
[2023-01-05 00:42:07] <djjjj> bots
[2023-01-05 00:42:11] <+Ralir> was the mistake make it craftable with old fish
[2023-01-05 00:42:16] <+Ralir> instead of introducing new fish
[2023-01-05 00:42:29] <@%hoodidupeh> 900 orehas are like 1800g profit + 300g per proc
[2023-01-05 00:43:03] <+Ralir> well that's not a savvy thing, design wise i mean
[2023-01-05 00:43:05] <%+UnzipsRS> especially since stoopzz had the entire west buying them since launch KEKW
[2023-01-05 00:43:11] <+Ralir> i feel like this game scales very poorly with our plagued bot economy
[2023-01-05 00:43:30] <@%hoodidupeh> might be 1.5g

[2023-01-05 00:43:47] <%Maus3r> 1.5 sounds right not factoring in great success and taking AH cut into account
[2023-01-05 00:43:56] <%Kwadrat_> last time i checked with current prices it was like 8,3-8,5 per oreha fusion
[2023-01-05 00:44:03] <@%hoodidupeh> thats still around 2k with procs
[2023-01-05 00:44:45] <%Maus3r> 3 stacks are given
[2023-01-05 00:44:48] <%Maus3r> with basic

[2023-01-05 00:44:57] <@%hoodidupeh> 7.55g crafting cost

[2023-01-05 00:46:20] <+mxsy> probably just some people crafting after brel clears
[2023-01-05 00:46:53] <%Kwadrat_> i think this and next week is low effort push to 1520
[2023-01-05 00:46:54] <@%hoodidupeh> looks like this week KEKW

[2023-01-05 01:09:40] <%+UnzipsRS> the thing with shadowhunter is you have the potential to do insane dmg purely because of how easy it is to have uptime on the boss but if a high dmg class like deathblow striker/ igniter sorc or scrapper have the same uptime as you they will destroy you in terms of dmg
[2023-01-05 01:09:41] <+Ralir> I need to give it a proper build, still no grudge LUL
[2023-01-05 01:09:41] <%+Arwya0203> because akkan hm is gonna be 1600
[2023-01-05 01:09:52] <%+alex__gfy> its an expensive spec class for as shitty as it scales imo

[2023-01-05 01:11:25] <%+UnzipsRS> to me shadowhunter felt smodge once every1 got max tripods with the new change because it was one of the only classes which didn't gain anything from that

[2023-01-05 01:14:57] <%Kwadrat_> i think we will be maybe not so chocked as korea with that because we know but i think we will be chocked a bit at least

[2023-01-05 18:37:20] <%+Tetris_Kappa> Depends entirely how many alts you push, how religiously you play them etc

[2023-01-05 18:37:32] <phantonic> baker is very above average monkaS
[2023-01-05 18:37:40] <%polig> depends on how cheap your main your going to leave
[2023-01-05 18:37:45] <%+Niki_xyOn> i played nearly every day casual and had 1490 on 6 chars, so with not every day, you are between 1475 and 1490 now on alts i suggest
[2023-01-05 18:37:59] <phantonic> the only reason im asking this is because im getting gatekept from carl pf and im like, how many ppl have chars at 1490 D:

[2023-01-05 18:56:05] <%Kwadrat_> orbs are way easier if u know they have only 3 possible patterns
[2023-01-05 18:56:25] <%Kwadrat_> and they have fixed spawn points
