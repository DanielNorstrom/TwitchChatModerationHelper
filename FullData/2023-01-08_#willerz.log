[2023-01-08 15:25:39] <@^Nightbot> Thank you for leaving a lurk! Just a quick tip - Lurks only count if you leave the volume slider still 'active' - but you can mute the browser tab up the top of the browser pages tab by clicking the speaker! Every little bit helps, thank you for helping!

[2023-01-08 15:28:32] <+s_saiyan7> bled to death this morning on my fourth ever raid. I was lost on the map...
[2023-01-08 15:28:36] <%+Rainer161> i only ever got one kill last wipe and that was when everything was for dirt cheap near the end
[2023-01-08 15:28:58] <maka94noctis> why is lvl 42 important?

[2023-01-08 15:29:13] <%ruttiger_sr> @maka94noctis max traders
[2023-01-08 15:29:22] <+dotfrag> You should have to use a high magnification scope, scoped in and get kills within 1 meter.
[2023-01-08 15:29:26] <%+Rainer161> @maka94noctis pretty much all max traders and like one decent reward task i think
[2023-01-08 15:29:26] <maka94noctis> ahh, thanks
