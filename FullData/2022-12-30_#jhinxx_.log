[2022-12-30 13:53:12] <%JarofNutella_> Berries are like a hybrid of different types of organisms. Berry is just a term that describes them all.
[2022-12-30 13:53:15] <+Zzyzx_Prime> Pomegranates are too much work
[2022-12-30 13:53:16] <Raepopsicles> You say "Eat some fruits and berries", why would you say that if they're not different? :think:
[2022-12-30 13:53:29] <%sergmist97> bruh who the hell eats tomatoes leclumShook
[2022-12-30 13:53:33] <+Zzyzx_Prime> Tomato is also a vegetable
[2022-12-30 13:53:34] <%ぽぴんだめあ (poppyndamere)> Idk I regard all sweet plants as fruit, but Ive once heard fruits are supposed to be on trees
[2022-12-30 13:53:37] <CactusMarsh> and pluto is still a planet
[2022-12-30 13:53:38] <kerakota> No one will ever say tomato is his favourite fruit anyway
[2022-12-30 13:53:44] <J_Biggitybar> @Zzyzx_Prime oh u mean blood fruit, every time i eat those i feel like a vampire
[2022-12-30 13:53:50] <Agatean> Cherry tomatoes are delicious
[2022-12-30 13:53:53] <J_Biggitybar> a very messy vampire
[2022-12-30 13:53:55] <couch_dragon_> cashews and peanuts are legumes or beans
[2022-12-30 13:53:59] <%Swequn> I think whether berries are seen as fruit is a cultural thing. Technically it is but put it in a fruit salad and you're wierd. Atleast here
[2022-12-30 13:54:02] <+Zzyzx_Prime> Jhinxx is a blood fruit now
[2022-12-30 13:54:12] <Blueshadow230> actually, strawberries are not fruits
[2022-12-30 13:54:12] <%Benisz> anything with high water content is a fruit
[2022-12-30 13:54:13] <J_Biggitybar> @Zzyzx_Prime wow lol
[2022-12-30 13:54:20] <%jestifizzle> Berries are great as a standalone fruit, but berry desserts are the worst...fact

[2022-12-30 13:54:36] <ImBentoVA> Berries are a more specific class of fruit, Berries also contain Oranges, Bananas and Peppers
[2022-12-30 13:54:44] <%abujero> hmmm easier to name it plant-food and animal-food NODDERS
[2022-12-30 13:54:45] <+Zzyzx_Prime> I dont even know if the British are real tbh
[2022-12-30 13:54:48] <%+Thiago_IHF> I heard an argument corn is a fruit, a vegetable and a grain
[2022-12-30 13:54:49] <couch_dragon_> Tomatoes are fruit
[2022-12-30 13:54:49] <Blueshadow230> to be more exact, strawberries are a collection of fruits
[2022-12-30 13:54:51] <%Ziiltch> wait, oranges are berries?
[2022-12-30 13:54:59] <%SomeRandomTacoo> berries have vegetable traits and fuirt also strawberries are not berries
[2022-12-30 13:55:02] <J_Biggitybar> @Zzyzx_Prime its all a scam
[2022-12-30 13:55:07] <+pandaeggss> for all intents and purposes they are fruit. In the most scientific of ways they are technically not I believe.

[2022-12-30 13:55:21] <%JarofNutella_> So Jhinxx_..... Would you identify as a Blueberry in that case? As its blue therefore the superior fruit jhinxxHYPERS
[2022-12-30 13:55:42] <%Ziiltch> ill just go back to - sweet =,fruit, not sweet= veggie nekrolinaPop
[2022-12-30 13:55:51] <+Zzyzx_Prime> Watermelons are multi-purpose fruits
[2022-12-30 13:55:52] <%Ziiltch> this is all too confusing
[2022-12-30 13:55:56] <Blueshadow230> it is like reading the thin print lmao
