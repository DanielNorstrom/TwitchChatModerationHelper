[2023-01-06 14:25:36] <%jjokoletti> is the dlc smelter demon dead? or is it the first boss in this dlc?
[2023-01-06 14:25:43] <LCorazza> if you like his P1, you can delay it with input reading. If you like P2, you can force him to start the fight at P2
[2023-01-06 14:25:44] <%Lovenewton98> @jjokoletti first

[2023-01-06 14:27:01] <%aredmongoose> Third Dragon Ring would be worth getting it's like the FAP ring in this game
[2023-01-06 14:27:10] <+Barzonius> If there is an ADP ring you gotta get that
[2023-01-06 14:27:15] <%Zheal> since you're pretty much one shot anyway, at least in phase 2 I'd go full glass cannon
[2023-01-06 14:27:16] <%OCR_Runner> bet is about past dlc today or not @dinossindgeil
[2023-01-06 14:27:20] <+Barzonius> ADP is the problem right?

[2023-01-06 14:28:11] <%+alexcon18> maybe try locking onto him and strafing his attacks by running behind his ass`?
[2023-01-06 14:28:12] <%Lovenewton98> I believe
[2023-01-06 14:28:21] <%aredmongoose> @9690suman adaptability, it determines agility which determines i-frames in a roll
[2023-01-06 14:28:27] <%+drsmegma_md> what is that sword?
[2023-01-06 14:28:29] <Tomineitor1> isnt there a ring that increases i-frames but also increase damage taken? (you are 1-shotable anyways)

[2023-01-06 14:29:21] <LCorazza> yes
[2023-01-06 14:29:24] <%Zheal> guess most of his attacks are swings, strafing out is probably rarely a thing
[2023-01-06 14:29:27] <LCorazza> both STR and ADP are on this DLC
[2023-01-06 14:29:39] <LCorazza> STR one was on your way to Smelter. It's very simple to pick up too

[2023-01-06 15:07:02] <%+alexcon18> @Barzonius ah i see, yeah luckily those type of stuff are always tested enough times in order to be correct, the things that they might say, that is wrong is stuff like an "super hidden" effect a weapon "might" have or some small errors in the list of dmg increase with particulary infusions
[2023-01-06 15:07:08] <%Hellem5> One of the worst areas in the game
[2023-01-06 15:07:08] <%mbx220> Worst part of the DLC imo
[2023-01-06 15:07:11] VIEWERS: 797
[2023-01-06 15:07:22] <%jjokoletti> maybe run faster? ;)
[2023-01-06 15:07:22] <%EvilMuffins1> The lever is another route

[2023-01-06 15:07:30] <%flushyflesh> i remember the fun of having to do all this every time I died to smelter

[2023-01-06 15:07:55] <swolderbeast> This area is terrible but still better than snow fields
[2023-01-06 15:08:03] <%Rocha1> I dont know if you know this already Nico but If you get naked that spell does nothing
[2023-01-06 15:08:03] <%+Kittyhavoc> This area was designed for leveled coop, they didnt make it with SL1 in mind 4Head
[2023-01-06 15:08:05] <%+Freyma> Yeah I had to kill them until they wouldnt respawn to get through
[2023-01-06 15:08:09] <%+alexcon18> yeah those archers cant be attracted by skulls sadly
[2023-01-06 15:08:21] <nadroj1985> are the snow fields in ivory king?
[2023-01-06 15:08:27] <%LCorazza> you can
[2023-01-06 15:08:28] <%TheSlinger90> If it's safe here why leave? Just make a nice comfy  home there
[2023-01-06 15:08:29] <%LittleWing322> tfw blue smelter demon route isnt the worst in the game
[2023-01-06 15:08:32] <+franklin713> Hi Dino! this level design is like the devs let their kids j add random enemies to random spots
[2023-01-06 15:08:37] <%+Kittyhavoc> Yes
[2023-01-06 15:08:39] <%EvilMuffins1> if this hurts too much, use the lever to take the secondary route to the boss
[2023-01-06 15:08:44] <%mbx220> WHoever designed this area had masochism in mind
[2023-01-06 15:08:52] <mattressmattress> each dlc has a co op designed area

[2023-01-06 15:15:56] <%+Kittyhavoc> @dinossindgeil Back when the DLC released, you could join this area - and similar ones in other DLC - without paying for DLC as a ghost, so they wanted you to struggle with runbacks to summon these poor souls
[2023-01-06 15:15:58] <%LittleWing322> You can just run in
[2023-01-06 15:16:01] <%+alexcon18> its a gauntlet more than a shortcut
[2023-01-06 15:16:09] <%EvilMuffins1> just pull the lever twice
[2023-01-06 15:16:09] <%mbx220> this route is even worse
[2023-01-06 15:16:13] <%foxxx0> this looks like fun KEKW
[2023-01-06 15:16:18] <%LittleWing322> The gate closes, so you have to run the second you pull it
[2023-01-06 15:16:23] <%+alexcon18> you have to insta sprint towards the gates
[2023-01-06 15:16:27] <%LCorazza> just one attempt
[2023-01-06 15:16:27] <RennSakayagi> the dlc is designed as co-op such that one person pulls the lever and the others go through the gate
[2023-01-06 15:16:32] <%LCorazza> you need to do in one go
[2023-01-06 15:16:32] <%+alexcon18> if they close they will never open
[2023-01-06 15:16:33] <graphigg> oh yeah thats way better
[2023-01-06 15:16:36] <%EvilMuffins1> oh they changed it, only 1 pull?!
[2023-01-06 15:16:36] <graphigg> definitely
[2023-01-06 15:16:40] <%EvilMuffins1> oh god
[2023-01-06 15:16:46] <kotschi1993> You have 1 chance to pull the lever and run through. If you miss it, you miss the alternative route
[2023-01-06 15:17:14] <+Barzonius> Ds2 just has shit enemy placement

[2023-01-06 15:17:38] <%+Kittyhavoc> @dinossindgeil If i were you i would at least get back to this when you get the true crown that disables hollowing
[2023-01-06 15:17:42] <%ComradeWilson> honestly this just straight up seems lame, i'm fine if you either skip for now/totally or just save state it once you have that set up
[2023-01-06 15:17:43] <%EvilMuffins1> it was built with playerhate in mind
[2023-01-06 15:17:49] <GrotesquelyObsessed> I am enjoying your pain :)
[2023-01-06 15:17:55] <%mbx220> DS2 is good just some of the areas are poorly designed and rage inducing on purpose. Like artificial difficulty
[2023-01-06 15:17:57] <%Zheal> there is probably some good consistent strats to go past that
[2023-01-06 15:17:58] <crazi3kitt3n> can we....come back to ds2 later?
[2023-01-06 15:18:00] <RennSakayagi> it wasn't enjoyable for me even on a leveled run so yeah...
[2023-01-06 15:18:01] <JoggingPlatypus> Literally stopped playing the DLC when I got to this point. I'm cool with challenge, but this is the def of artificial and lazy difficulty.

[2023-01-06 15:27:38] <%+xlawson> Blue smelter run is my favorite part of the game :)
[2023-01-06 15:27:43] <%mbx220> DS2 has a lot of garbage artificial difficulty, that's what makes it bad otherwise it's fine
[2023-01-06 15:27:43] <+ApfelSchreck> this area made me quit this game
[2023-01-06 15:27:51] <%waltuhfinger4216> There are no Objective opinions

[2023-01-06 15:28:31] <%DhufishHunter> gives ADP and a boost to stats
[2023-01-06 15:28:38] <tellmeyourcrime> so do you have to use bow then?
[2023-01-06 15:28:39] <+MeepTots> DS2 had the biggest difficulty jump between base game & DLC
[2023-01-06 15:28:48] <%+themrsnail> is that your objective opinion @waltuhfinger4216?
[2023-01-06 15:28:53] <%+Mighty_Noob_> Then it's not an opinion
[2023-01-06 15:28:55] <%painkiller752> Hey its the part why i hate this DLC dinossNya

[2023-01-06 15:33:31] <+MeepTots> @shane_xa I just did the same thing recently, playing through DS 1-3 all bosses casually, and my honest opinion is that I had the most fun with DS2, but these DLCs in DS2 are hard as shit
[2023-01-06 15:33:32] <%+themrsnail> could always come back to it later, yeah?

[2023-01-06 15:41:31] <%heisenleif> the only thing missing in elden ring is the gauntlet of strength like in sekiro so you dont have to run the entire game to replay a boss fight
[2023-01-06 15:41:35] <%Zheal> I don't think they are making up mistakes, it's just that they are going with the zeitgeist and design their games accordingly
[2023-01-06 15:41:43] <%+cirillios> You can get a bunch of effigys killing the skeletons under that one house in Majula

[2023-01-06 15:42:22] <%+xlawson> it's going to be a big pain to do it with only three at level 1
[2023-01-06 15:42:30] <%+cirillios> bonfire ascetic in the area with the 5 effigy chest will also get you 5 effigies per
[2023-01-06 15:42:31] <%Rocha1> I think I killed him with 3 the first time but since you are lvl 1 it might be tough

[2023-01-06 15:53:35] <Fenlast> ADP make faster estus, faster consumables and more iframes for dodge why one stat have so much in a game
[2023-01-06 15:53:38] <lukasdelapinta> good luck broenem
[2023-01-06 15:53:48] <%BlindExecution> I can imagine. Not only level 1 but not having adp would change how the game plays and feels
[2023-01-06 15:53:49] <MarshallRTEast> Man the DS2 damage numbers make it really hard to estimate your damage.
[2023-01-06 15:54:07] <%remiri> having a 5 iframe dodge aint ez
[2023-01-06 15:54:14] <noctvrno_> @Fenlast because it's tied to Agility which kind of makes sense to boost the things you mentioned

[2023-01-06 16:00:53] <%foxxx0> i think you get knocked by his knee
[2023-01-06 16:00:58] <%Zheal> I think you have to dodge more 90°

[2023-01-06 16:01:19] <+Cyeye01> i think you cant roll forwards on that attack. only 90 degrees to the side
[2023-01-06 16:01:25] <%affuki> i think it was roll into it and quite late aswell

[2023-01-06 16:01:49] <%foxxx0> no, you rolled diagonally too close to his body
[2023-01-06 16:01:59] <%PastaSocks> you rolled diag forward
[2023-01-06 16:02:09] <+Cyeye01> i think you rolled diagonally forward right

[2023-01-06 16:37:48] <%MrNinja1234> the controls are very touchy with how short you can hold B to start the sprint animation. that coupled with the kludgier movement in DS2 in general means that it's annoying when you try to roll away

[2023-01-06 16:41:43] <EVERNECTAR> @dinossindgeil Dark Souls 2 is honestly inexcusable in many ways, especially considering the budget that From had from DS1's success. I know B Team worked on it and all, but that was also a conscious internal decision, so...

[2023-01-06 16:42:22] <pmff96> ds2 is clunky but I really like the game
[2023-01-06 16:42:26] <%remiri> ds3 is an admission of the mistakes done in ds2 imo
[2023-01-06 16:42:35] <%remiri> i applaud they took a risk
[2023-01-06 16:42:36] <%Conquer_Claudio> I feel if ds2 didnt happen the way it did ds3 wouldnt have been as good
[2023-01-06 16:42:40] <%MrNinja1234> I think it had a lot of interesting designs, but ultimately a lot of them were negatives
[2023-01-06 16:42:48] <Zunjithuwa> this is more fun coz your laughing more @dinossindgeil
[2023-01-06 16:42:49] <%+JoeInNeed> trying new things isn't bad. DS2 honestly feels like it wasn't playtested enough. Like they should have known some of these were bad

[2023-01-06 16:42:59] <EVERNECTAR> @dinossindgeil I don't mind them trying new things, but no one can look at something like the Blue Smelter run and think it's a good idea. I don't know how some of these mistakes make it past planning stages.
[2023-01-06 16:43:01] <%MrNinja1234> but the fashion souls in DS2 is by far the best of all of the games
[2023-01-06 16:43:06] <icds_nutz> DS2 tried new things and it was such a massive success they had to roll it back for DS3 otherwise people would think Tanimura is a batter game designer than Miyazaki YEP

[2023-01-06 16:43:43] <%MrNinja1234> @EVERNECTAR I think a big part of their design philosophy for 2 was creating a world that required you to interact with it instead of just sprinting past enemies.

[2023-01-06 16:50:46] <%+PandaAction> @Sarah88_66 tyvm! always wanted to try to play with saves, so I can try a bosses more often etc.
[2023-01-06 16:50:50] <%+old_raspy> Maybe healing after he does that ranged wave attack?
[2023-01-06 16:51:02] <%MrNinja1234> @EVERNECTAR they wouldn't be the first studio to think they had a banger idea for design themes in a game to be wrong. and by the time the game came out, they'd certainly been working on at least DLC1 for a bit. I agree it sucks, but I wouldn't be surprised that the devs thought it was still pretty good. maybe their playstyles naturally made it more fun for them
[2023-01-06 16:51:09] <%JiL000> it is worse

[2023-01-06 17:39:48] <%$Doudoussin> Btw for Sekiro don't you want to go for Purification ending instead of immortal severance ? It doesn't have any less bosses, only 3 more (including Owl Father)
[2023-01-06 17:39:49] <%Dooombreed> We definitely learned that DS2 dlcs are bullshit

[2023-01-06 17:44:22] <aditya0499> Hi @dinossindgeil :) . I have been busy with my applications hence not able to be here that much
[2023-01-06 17:44:26] <EquaLiize> i mean yeah as a runner ER is a bit tediouis
[2023-01-06 17:44:33] <%$LeeJamz> Torrent can be boring
[2023-01-06 17:44:33] <EquaLiize> since the first 1 hour is always just set up
[2023-01-06 17:44:33] <%shilkey10> ER setup ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-06 17:44:49] <femilian678> with pleasure
[2023-01-06 17:44:52] <%shilkey10> It was very good casually
[2023-01-06 17:44:58] <%LCorazza> @EquaLiize it depends on which weapon you're using. Right now setup takes 25~30min
[2023-01-06 17:45:04] <plip_plop_plip_plop> Yea that’s the only downside of huge game is bigger set up. Worth it by far
[2023-01-06 17:45:08] <%+gaming_on_thrones> I love Elden 🥰

[2023-01-06 17:45:15] <neamraven> I love ER but my fav is DS3
[2023-01-06 17:45:24] <EquaLiize> Its like Max0r said, ER is Dark Souils 4,5 and 6
[2023-01-06 17:45:24] <%pay_87> I don't know, it might be cause it's gino so there's a huge grain of salt involved. but I feel like with the most recent strats, the setup isn't even half as bad anymore

[2023-01-06 18:08:31] <%jjokoletti> good question ...
[2023-01-06 18:08:32] <%LCorazza> The best weapon would be the Ice Rapier. Is an upgraded version of the Rapier
[2023-01-06 18:08:36] <%Secret_Berzerker> idk what your setup is, but the simpleton ring is great here bc of +5 more ADP @dinossindgeil kinda like Carthus ring. It's in Brume tower
[2023-01-06 18:08:46] <%+ecstasy_in_service> you got a save state to use ?
[2023-01-06 18:09:05] <%shilkey10> It depends on your current agi
[2023-01-06 18:09:05] <%OCR_Runner> dmg is good, have tried not getting hit? PauseChamp
[2023-01-06 18:09:11] <%BanjoTheUncle> New ring Pog
[2023-01-06 18:09:13] <Hansitmeagain> so basically at this point you have to do all these bosses hitless to make it Hmmm
[2023-01-06 18:09:15] <%shilkey10> If you already have 92
[2023-01-06 18:09:23] <%ComradeWilson> alonne
[2023-01-06 18:09:26] <%LCorazza> The Ring would be good after this boss. Since you will be able to use Vessel Shield and still keep 92 ADP
[2023-01-06 18:09:34] <%LCorazza> 92 AGL*
[2023-01-06 18:09:42] <%shilkey10> you need 96 for the next iframe
[2023-01-06 18:10:06] <%LCorazza> @shilkey10 let him get it. So he can use Vessel Shield after Aava
[2023-01-06 18:10:07] <%shilkey10> You can only get that if you have the mask from prowler invader

[2023-01-06 18:34:25] <%LCorazza> i think that was the point of the game at the time?
[2023-01-06 18:34:27] <No_Name_Fausti> hello everyone
[2023-01-06 18:34:34] <%camf3> I think that maybe they got carried away cause of the success around DS1 and it being "difficult" ?? mopShrug
[2023-01-06 18:34:37] <%Trekcoyem> The dlc is absurd compared to the rest of the game
[2023-01-06 18:34:50] <%Trekcoyem> And it's not always hard for the right reasons
[2023-01-06 18:34:55] <nashdur> its because you are level 1, when you have the equipment and the weapon its not imposibble
[2023-01-06 18:34:59] <%camf3> So they like wantd to make this the ultimate? idk though mopShrug
[2023-01-06 18:35:01] <%$encode1g> Guys are we at risk of a WW3 ? China,India,NK,Russi,Iran are all acting up Sadge
[2023-01-06 18:35:09] <%ohihello> being hard is not a competition
[2023-01-06 18:35:11] <%BlindExecution> No
[2023-01-06 18:35:18] <Nekrazero> I think that was the intent. The team that worked on this game didn't understand Miyazaki's philosophy of design and just were like "Souls is supposed to be absurdely hard"
[2023-01-06 18:35:19] <%yoyasuper> DS2 has a trophy if you die for the first time but the other games so it's obvious that was the devs intent
[2023-01-06 18:35:25] <%yoyasuper> don't*
[2023-01-06 18:35:37] <%+Gosfi> @yoyasuper they all have that trophy tho
[2023-01-06 18:35:50] <Nekrazero> the welcome to dark souls trohpy

[2023-01-06 18:36:24] <%spellskreen> @dinossindgeil cuz when it was releas, old hard core boys complain about that vanila was to easy when compare to DS1

[2023-01-06 18:36:25] <%yoyasuper> @gosfi they didn't
[2023-01-06 18:36:25] <%LCorazza> @dinossindgeil I think they had that in mind when the game was released. That Dark Souls had to be hardcore. But also they did the game that way so people would play online and help each other.
