[2022-12-22 13:09:19] <sktbrdngdwgs> Steak might not take much to cook, 100% true (coming from a chef). But it also doesnt take much to RUIN that same steak. Although it takes only basics to make, those basics must be on point or your steak wont be

[2022-12-22 18:18:48] <SelinaJo> I generally thought the character behind the empty chair was Abdul
[2022-12-22 18:18:57] <%MattyH99HD> Don't see the point in them being independent tbh
[2022-12-22 18:19:00] <SelinaJo> But it was in game

[2022-12-22 18:20:15] <SelinaJo> @mattyh99hd true, but I guess they want that so if they are allowed to be independent they will see how it is.
[2022-12-22 18:21:02] VIEWERS: 3¬†164
[2022-12-22 18:21:42] <SelinaJo> It's there right if they are allowed I suppose
[2022-12-22 18:21:53] <%$creamypouchh> Like Scotland left the uk I think
[2022-12-22 18:21:59] <%MattyH99HD> Don't really see the benefits for them though
