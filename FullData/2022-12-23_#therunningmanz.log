[2022-12-23 16:29:13] <+Schimmeldude> since Ish is not coming back, I would make a stash for your NBC suite with the dryback. Leave everything you don't really need to get the ghillie suite, so you have more stamina

[2022-12-23 16:30:06] <+Schimmeldude> it's not about saving gear for another life, it's just to make room for now to get to the ghillie faster
[2022-12-23 16:30:08] <dutchbackcorner> Ish checked a playback and couldn‚Äôt see the killer

[2022-12-23 19:27:41] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!
