[2023-01-06 11:19:38] <FallenSleuth> So you saying Charkra doesn't use MP?
[2023-01-06 11:19:53] <Heurou> Chakra uses ATB thats all
[2023-01-06 11:20:02] <FallenSleuth> @Heurou Oh nice!
[2023-01-06 11:20:08] <Luquinhas26> help alot when u need use mp well
[2023-01-06 11:20:22] <%TidusZecht> if you use chakra, you get a % restoration of your HP. If you do it twice in a row and the 2nd use happens before the first one's cure takes effect, you get the same HP recovery for the 2nd one even though 40% of the new HP value would heal less
[2023-01-06 11:20:45] <Heurou> @TidusZecht i didnt know that you could spam it that way that is awesome
[2023-01-06 11:20:48] VIEWERS: 338
[2023-01-06 11:20:51] <%TidusZecht> because chakra calculates its value as soon as it's cast

[2023-01-06 13:04:41] <%MajinShoe> I prefer this combat system to CC's. hoping they stick with this style for part 2
[2023-01-06 13:05:17] <DrHapsburg> @MajinShoe I think they will go the Intergrade route, so like this but more

[2023-01-06 13:05:47] <sephirani> CC was sticking to the old game style
[2023-01-06 13:05:53] <%spectr0nn> the crisis core remake does not really influence the FF7 remake project
[2023-01-06 13:05:54] <sephirani> just some minor tweeks here and there

[2023-01-06 13:06:33] <%spectr0nn> i wouldnt call it minor. the basic melee combat in the CC remake has been greatly improved

[2023-01-06 13:07:15] <sephirani> greatly indeed more fluid, but not anyhing bigger other than the buster mode

[2023-01-06 13:07:33] <%spectr0nn> yeah basic mechanics are still the same
[2023-01-06 13:07:46] <%MajinShoe> I just didnt enjoy the item menu or ability menu in CC
[2023-01-06 13:08:34] <%MajinShoe> I think I just got accustomed to the remake combat system and was going in to CC expecting a similar style
[2023-01-06 13:08:50] <sephirani> item really sukd, but ability was a great improvement from psp version i remember how i had a hard time adjusting to it on psp while i was young xD
[2023-01-06 13:08:56] <%spectr0nn> @MajinShoe from a development standpoint it makes the most sense that the team builds off the mechanics of this game for the sequel, because they already laid the groundwork, so it saves them a lot of time on the sequels
[2023-01-06 13:09:29] VIEWERS: 444
[2023-01-06 13:09:56] <%MajinShoe> that makes sense. i just wasnt sure if they were testing some new things in CC for Remake
[2023-01-06 13:10:15] <sephirani> another thing i loved, was how they left Tifa insanely broken and Heavy hiter as she was
[2023-01-06 13:10:40] <%spectr0nn> also im fairly sure that a different dev team worked on CC Reunion seperate from FF7 Rebirth
[2023-01-06 13:10:49] <%spectr0nn> maybe some overlap here and there
[2023-01-06 13:11:01] <%Neobullseye> The real question is; Dirge of Cerberus remaster when?

[2023-01-06 13:13:08] <%+ReimHikari> should be, i mean the list was compleatly faithful

[2023-01-06 15:26:15] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reimhikari depends ... I usually can get away with a few minutes of petting, though snuggles are more likely to happen and make it worse, but if I don't touch the kitty, we can coexist in the same space for a few hours sevenLUL

[2023-01-06 15:29:37] <MultiSayto> Hi Seven and chat.
[2023-01-06 15:30:11] <%Neobullseye> Don't worry. I'm sure Yuffie will be glad to take some (or all) of it off your hands.
[2023-01-06 15:30:11] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reimhikari so the antihistamine makes it so I can do those things without severe reaction, but it is to varying degrees based on where the cat hormones get to me. like a cat scratch is the worse as it puffs up and gets super itchy and looks like a horrible rash, with or without antihistamines

[2023-01-06 15:32:55] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reimhikari it is getting worse. I used to be only allergic if the hormones got in my eye, and would make them swell, and I could always deal with it as a kid, and my father was the same.

[2023-01-06 15:34:18] <%$Bradpath> I'm allergic to cats too, and have had them all my life. My last cat sneezed INTO my eyeball once. it was gnarly.
[2023-01-06 15:34:27] <%TidusZecht> a lot of the time, according to something I read, people aren't actually allergic to cats, it's their saliva they're allergic to

[2023-01-06 15:35:23] <%+ReimHikari> a hormone thing
[2023-01-06 15:35:41] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reimhikari my father owned a cat until it cut off his breathing just like me, but when I was a teen we kept an outdoor stray as a semi pet and he could touch it and everything as long as he was outside, which also helps me. outside I have far less a problem petting them

[2023-01-06 16:20:22] <%+Vinitus> be quiet fans are price/power one of the best
[2023-01-06 16:20:23] <%+ATacticalRetreat> I think they are a little more expensive since they use better plastic to make the fan blades longer

[2023-01-06 16:27:28] <%+kaspauf> Sorry my stream cut out, you said put a pin in the fan to prevent it from spinning while you use the compressed air?
[2023-01-06 16:27:33] <%Neobullseye> If all else fails, you can always use fire to sterilize it.
[2023-01-06 16:27:44] <%XyFreak> your fingers maybe
[2023-01-06 16:28:03] <%Neobullseye> Depends on the size of the fingers.

[2023-01-06 16:33:02] <%XyFreak> https://www.ifixit.com/products/mako-driver-kit-64-precision-bits <- this is what i have to open stuff :P
[2023-01-06 16:33:10] <%+Rash808> On steam deck you can have 3ds emulators for Bravely Default 1 :D
[2023-01-06 16:33:23] <%+ReimHikari> and bravely second :D
[2023-01-06 16:33:25] <%XyFreak> @kaspauf the only important part is that the fans and heatsinks are clean
[2023-01-06 16:33:36] <%Neobullseye> Bravely Default 1 and Bravely Second (which is a completely different game, and should not be confused with Bravely Default 2, which is /another/ completely different game).
[2023-01-06 16:33:48] <%Neobullseye> On that note, I also still want Bravely Third :(
[2023-01-06 16:33:56] <%+ReimHikari> same neo
[2023-01-06 16:34:06] <%+ReimHikari> i hope we get more ringabell action

[2023-01-06 16:36:11] <%+kaspauf> @kaspauf So the motherboard and other components don't matter as much? I thought dust sitting on a motherboard would not be good?
[2023-01-06 16:36:30] <%TidusZecht> some of the materia are 'too strong'

[2023-01-06 16:36:42] <%Neobullseye> There were rumors, and the creator was like "Well, maybe we could do that if there is enough demand for it".
[2023-01-06 16:36:45] <%Neobullseye> Something like that.
[2023-01-06 16:36:54] <%TidusZecht> so the ng+ stuff replaces those with alternate materia
[2023-01-06 16:36:59] <%Neobullseye> Nothing definite though.
[2023-01-06 16:37:18] <%+ReimHikari> there was a bravely default with microtransactions on pc but it already anounced ToS
[2023-01-06 16:37:23] <%+ReimHikari> EoS* sorry
[2023-01-06 16:37:39] <%XyFreak> @kaspauf the motherboard inside the ps5 is enclosed in an aluminium shell
[2023-01-06 16:38:00] <%XyFreak> there's no dust getting in there
[2023-01-06 16:38:02] <%Neobullseye> End of Service.
[2023-01-06 16:38:04] <%+ReimHikari> bravely default praying blade was called
[2023-01-06 16:38:06] <AJReid93> EOS = End of Service
[2023-01-06 16:38:14] <%Neobullseye> It was some Gacha game of whatever.
[2023-01-06 16:38:30] <%+ReimHikari> i know i know, this was the last project for bravely team
[2023-01-06 16:38:39] VIEWERS: 527
[2023-01-06 16:38:46] <%+ReimHikari> so maybe something new now
[2023-01-06 16:40:02] <%+kaspauf> @kaspauf If you look back on the thread, I said one more question, my mom's desktop :) , I know it is going have dust sitting on the motherboard among other places, what is the best way to remove this/clean this, compressed air or what exactly? Any help is appreciated (I am visiting her in a week)
[2023-01-06 16:40:11] <%XyFreak> oh sorry
[2023-01-06 16:40:21] <%XyFreak> OH
[2023-01-06 16:40:22] <%crimsonlight73> So what makes Hard Mode different from normal?
[2023-01-06 16:40:30] <%XyFreak> just screw it open and blow out the dust
[2023-01-06 16:40:34] <%XyFreak> easy

[2023-01-06 16:41:21] <%Neobullseye> Oh, wait.
[2023-01-06 16:41:27] <%+ReimHikari> @Neobullseye ye, at least they said they will put an offline version if you want to play it
[2023-01-06 16:41:30] <%XyFreak> and blow over the motherboard and other components if you want to no problem
[2023-01-06 16:41:36] <%TidusZecht> yeah they placed that there for hard mode
[2023-01-06 16:41:50] <%+ReimHikari> oh and it was brilliant lights, the praying badge was another one from 2012 LUL
[2023-01-06 16:42:08] <Duxxors> that sounds amazing
[2023-01-06 16:42:24] <skulgun> so where *do* you get MP from
[2023-01-06 16:42:25] <Duxxors> any new items/equipment?
[2023-01-06 16:42:32] <%crimsonlight73> So it's more than just making enemies HP sponges

[2023-01-06 16:42:45] VIEWERS: 536
[2023-01-06 16:42:58] <%+kaspauf> @XyFreak blow it out with compressed air? I was always worried that could damage something like that but I will take your advice :) since you do this more often than me. Just confirm, compressed air is the best way even on the motherboard (I am extra careful not to ruin her stuff vs me ha
[2023-01-06 16:43:19] <%+Lady_Lorr> boxes are great in Normal for potions and boxes are great in hard mode for mp
[2023-01-06 16:43:35] <%XyFreak> @XyFreak it's not the "best" way to do it but it's by far the easiest
[2023-01-06 16:43:52] <%+Lady_Lorr> conversely normal the mp in boxes is irrelevant and the potions are useless in hard mode
[2023-01-06 16:44:07] <%XyFreak> @XyFreak the alternative would be to take it apart and put the motherboard into the dish washer and putting it into rice for a week afterwards before you reassemble it
[2023-01-06 16:44:47] VIEWERS: 536
[2023-01-06 16:45:00] <%+kaspauf> @XyFreak just a keep a fair distance away away with the compressed air ha. Haha put it in rice hah, shocking enough saved my old Nokia phone BUT I know this is a joke, well place and thanks again for your help! :)
[2023-01-06 16:45:27] <%XyFreak> it is not a joke
[2023-01-06 16:45:29] <%XyFreak> i was serious
[2023-01-06 16:45:37] <%+kaspauf> for the motherboard??
[2023-01-06 16:45:40] <%XyFreak> yes
[2023-01-06 16:45:43] <%+ReimHikari> the rice thing works
[2023-01-06 16:45:53] <%XyFreak> dishwasher and then into rice to dry it
[2023-01-06 16:45:55] <%+ReimHikari> saved my mobile after bathing on the sea with it
[2023-01-06 16:45:57] <%TidusZecht> rice will absorb moisture yeah

[2023-01-06 16:47:23] <%+kaspauf> @XyFreak I thought the dishwasher part was the joke of it, not the rice since dishwashers well, they can be rough sometimes
