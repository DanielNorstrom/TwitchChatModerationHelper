[2022-12-10 19:06:06] <%+danccalot> he did make wonders with that Rogue roster tho.. but i see why he struggled in G2
[2022-12-10 19:06:19] <%Corvus_TheCrow> Yeah you should probably change that wallpaper if you don't want people asking all the time about if you're still on G2 ahahah
[2022-12-10 19:06:24] <%Serynnn> penguNOOT
[2022-12-10 19:06:37] <%iamAdzy> I was talking with a friend about rookies of the year, we agreed there's been like 2 in Beualo and Spoit, you think anyone else was?
[2022-12-10 19:07:13] <%iamAdzy> I meant overall
[2022-12-10 19:07:26] <%iamAdzy> Like an actual standout rookie
[2022-12-10 19:07:27] <raamvp> hey bro
[2022-12-10 19:07:31] <%+danccalot> Spoit is hands down a better Rookie
[2022-12-10 19:07:45] <%iamAdzy> ohhh
[2022-12-10 19:07:45] <%iamAdzy> I see
[2022-12-10 19:07:46] <%+danccalot> spoits ROTY, and if not its rigged
[2022-12-10 19:07:48] <raamvp> @Pengu wil you play valarant in future and become an esport player?
[2022-12-10 19:07:54] <@%+FalconzGT> @Pengu https://we.tl/t-gDQvMsMCQE Now fix YO damn wallpaper
[2022-12-10 19:07:55] <%iamAdzy> Would you say Benja was one?

[2022-12-10 19:08:06] <%iamAdzy> LikeEfac was in T2 though
[2022-12-10 19:08:11] <%iamAdzy> I wouldn't count him
[2022-12-10 19:08:12] <%+danccalot> LikEfac only played one stage
[2022-12-10 19:08:21] <%+danccalot> Benja didnt win last year i think
[2022-12-10 19:08:30] <%+danccalot> yes

[2022-12-10 19:08:40] <%+danccalot> even tho i think Benja is better
[2022-12-10 19:08:58] <raamvp> @Pengu wil you play valarant in future and become an esport player?
[2022-12-10 19:09:16] <%iamAdzy> I think the biggest question is if G2 are gonna do another revamp
[2022-12-10 19:09:19] <%+danccalot> i still feel like Heroic is one move away from a championship ready contender
[2022-12-10 19:09:36] <raamvp> you sill have G2 wallpaper in your desktop thats cool

[2022-12-10 21:40:10] <%jamdoll_> LUL
[2022-12-10 21:41:16] <%jamdoll_> I dont even know what boosting is in WoW nazagi told me you was in onr
[2022-12-10 21:41:18] <%jamdoll_> One
[2022-12-10 21:41:55] <%Nazagi> @jamdoll_ People buy titles/gear/raids/mythic+/ etc for $ and thats boosting
[2022-12-10 21:42:05] <%Nazagi> there's 2 types - gold boosting and money boosting
[2022-12-10 21:42:13] <%Nazagi> the money boosting is the TOS part
[2022-12-10 21:42:44] <@Tharantos> normally you dont rush a mythic item on Ezreal btw veiHmm
[2022-12-10 21:42:44] <%Nazagi> I boosted for $ for pvp. I'll openly say it. I got perma suspended for 3 years
[2022-12-10 21:42:49] <@Tharantos> nope
[2022-12-10 21:42:50] <%Nazagi> Then they unbanned me
[2022-12-10 21:42:59] <%jamdoll_> L @nazagi
[2022-12-10 21:43:02] <@Tharantos> yea essence reaver and manamune first
[2022-12-10 21:43:35] <+amishfps> Don’t you not build them together cuz they are basically the same ?
[2022-12-10 21:43:46] <%Nazagi> ER isn't needed that often for ezreal.
[2022-12-10 21:44:35] <+amishfps> I like how your level up looks like it says “new stuff”
[2022-12-10 21:45:20] <@Tharantos> i mean yea u can skip essence reaver and go for Hydra instead since the item is just broken
[2022-12-10 21:45:34] <@Tharantos> but either way u would get a mythic as 3rd item
[2022-12-10 21:45:40] <%Nazagi> Triforce is the better over ER (essence reaver). if pengu feels like he's mana starved then manamune needs to be built early before tri
[2022-12-10 21:46:01] <%jamdoll_> Im off to sleep cya pengu
[2022-12-10 21:46:29] <@Tharantos> look here for example https://www.probuilds.net/guide/show/na1/4513717778/jD04iHE_5fN7mFpnY6lWWVkaIZzo3nakUDHTDQxC95hC
[2022-12-10 21:46:29] <%Nazagi> But imo Triforce is better due to value of hp, MR/armor items, and spellbalde + speed where as ER just gives out the spellblade and AD/crit
[2022-12-10 21:47:12] <@Tharantos> nah triforce rush is really bad, not a lot of combat stats and hard to lasthit with
[2022-12-10 21:47:27] <@Tharantos> its not what it used to be Aware
[2022-12-10 21:47:56] <@Tharantos> or here patrik for example https://www.probuilds.net/guide/show/euw1/6183477301/HRET0WWPYSu5BSHgmveWXMXfI9FdHMSiUqB16CFdVKNsqpS5
[2022-12-10 21:48:11] <@Tharantos> hydra -> manamune -> trinity
[2022-12-10 21:48:19] <Cherrypai_> Wie gehts pengu?
[2022-12-10 21:48:20] <%Nazagi> Even though I got perma suspended in 2017 NA, I still play LoL on my KR/EU acct. Probuilds is just to give references to builds.

[2022-12-10 21:49:08] <Cherrypai_> @Tharantos i specifically read the chat rules and it didnt say anything about it
[2022-12-10 21:49:22] <%Nazagi> It all depends on enemy comp as well as playstyle. In terms of power spike: ER < Tri. Triforce also better for kiting
[2022-12-10 21:49:32] <@Tharantos> yea lazy streamer never updated it but it should be common sense right? @Cherrypai_
[2022-12-10 21:49:36] <@Tharantos> dont worry tho no big deal

[2022-12-10 21:52:13] <%Nazagi> yes
[2022-12-10 21:52:28] <@Tharantos> oh dont worry im aware of that
[2022-12-10 21:52:30] <%Nazagi> idk the german name lol
[2022-12-10 21:52:36] <@Ferral> cant go wrong with a blue item on ezreal
[2022-12-10 21:52:46] <%Nazagi> blue build ezreal best ezreal.
[2022-12-10 21:52:52] <%Nazagi> except ER
[2022-12-10 21:53:01] <%Nazagi> ER is bad ezreal
[2022-12-10 21:53:08] <@Tharantos> but also feel like it shouldnt be overthought so much, pro players do stuff for a good reason and when the majority does not build a mythic early i believe them :)
[2022-12-10 21:54:26] <Cherrypai_> 5 people btw
[2022-12-10 21:54:44] <%Nazagi> Some champs don't build mythic first, but some champs need it early. Ezreal is one of those that actually does need it early to scale hard mid-late
[2022-12-10 21:56:45] <christmas_burgler> EU server really in shambles
[2022-12-10 21:56:52] <%Nazagi> It really depends. I wasn't able to see what the other team comp is
[2022-12-10 21:56:59] <EchoedWolf> ga? or frozen heart?
