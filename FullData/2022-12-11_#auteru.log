[2022-12-11 04:11:34] <%xSHOUTforAlthea> You're a TERUrist
[2022-12-11 04:11:46] <%Sanatukai> how it works is that if the motion is made by another person beside yourself and if the game doesn't make "blur" well ( which is 80% of games made)  you can get motion sickness. frame rate can attribute to this as well
[2022-12-11 04:11:47] <keifkid420> happy bday
[2022-12-11 04:12:29] <%Sanatukai> also for frame rate, the less frame rate the better a person can handle extream motions
[2022-12-11 04:12:43] <%Sanatukai> 60 is the frame rate for such things
[2022-12-11 04:12:50] <%+TheLazyGrizzly> So for you motion blur is good?
[2022-12-11 04:12:50] <%Sanatukai> is worst i mean

[2022-12-11 21:34:34] <%justagummi> I think the two bosses I hate the thought of fighting the most are Sif cause she's a doggo and Pscilla cause she nice beautiful fluffy and her backstory is so tragic just wanna give her a hug same for Sif
