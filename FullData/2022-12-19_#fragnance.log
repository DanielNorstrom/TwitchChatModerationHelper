[2022-12-19 09:58:19] <unluckythen> @SanyaLitvyak whats wrong with that
[2022-12-19 09:58:25] <%+2_Bear_Arms> im not sure? max said he reached out to join. Maybe he they wanted a more extensive trial than he had the bandwith for? its all speculation isnt it

[2022-12-19 10:09:09] <trickzterrr> how many did echo and liquid have on this
[2022-12-19 10:09:15] <Siandemm> black hole pump EZ
[2022-12-19 10:09:41] <+admiraltegetthoff> @trickzterrr around 30 i think
[2022-12-19 10:10:26] <trickzterrr> oh wow do you think its just better planning and preparing
[2022-12-19 10:10:45] <@%+SanyaLitvyak> echo and liquid are just in a tier of their own in every aspect
[2022-12-19 10:10:59] <Secrifal> echo and liquid both 60
[2022-12-19 10:11:01] <Siandemm> both guilds 60~
[2022-12-19 10:12:09] <%DrRadzig> but to be fair to liquid, they pulled the boss 40times before the nerf
[2022-12-19 10:12:11] <+00_tom_s_00> why is jmy gone from echo to method?

[2022-12-19 10:12:38] <Secrifal> @SanyaLitvyak  cant really say that after so many tiers since the rebuilt. the aspiration is to be the same level as them. or be right behind them as of now
[2022-12-19 10:13:32] <N0xe34> What Jmy played before maining DH ?
[2022-12-19 10:13:32] <@%^Moobot> Yea we on a ramp again, back at > https://www.youtube.com/user/JimmyLandqvist , unprivating & new post inc xo
[2022-12-19 10:14:36] <+Sadam66> @N0xe34 i remember him playing warlock in legion
[2022-12-19 10:14:40] <%DrRadzig> @N0xe34 Warlock/Warrior/Feral(long time ago)
[2022-12-19 10:14:48] <%DrRadzig> he dabbled in rogue
[2022-12-19 10:14:56] <Muffinquiparle> @N0xe34 he played feral at SoO
[2022-12-19 10:14:57] <N0xe34> Ok thanks
[2022-12-19 10:15:36] <+tsyakaz> Did the other raids 4 heal this encounter?
[2022-12-19 10:16:37] <Secrifal> yea they did
[2022-12-19 10:16:48] <%DrRadzig> @tsyakaz yes
[2022-12-19 10:18:55] <trickzterrr> my biggest wish is that eu claims world first title so these americans cant scream and shout like its their life
[2022-12-19 10:19:05] <+zoomx_> weird
[2022-12-19 10:19:55] <Secrifal> dont think its possible this tier. unless echo kills it within these 2 days? if it goes to reset liquid gets it

[2022-12-19 11:13:21] <%lowsry> Freehold = best @laulauberg
[2022-12-19 11:14:14] <Scheia> guys is arcane good on M+ as well ?
[2022-12-19 11:14:49] <yoyatta> Arcane does well in M+, not easy to play tho

[2022-12-19 11:21:24] <!%Gemsplitter> @laulauberg best to ask someone who pushes high m+ bro, what the best and worst dungeons are is like irrelevant either havoc is good in m+ or it's not. although it is possible that havoc will share a melee slot with another class depending on dungeon so you multiclass then but that's like rank 1 pushing
[2022-12-19 11:21:42] <kamikaze___tv> !best
[2022-12-19 11:21:46] <kamikaze___tv> !try
[2022-12-19 11:22:09] <+laulauberg> @Gemsplitter is it still irrelevant if i wanna know how i can compare my performance depending on the dungeon?

[2022-12-19 11:23:43] <!%Gemsplitter> i mean look at top havoc logs then @laulauberg that will be your answer but it's week 1 you aren't going to see any developed meta because everyone who is top m+ player is raiding

[2022-12-19 11:26:43] <+MajorNimrod> ever
[2022-12-19 11:26:55] <smoochsmoochy> the whole raid is quite good
[2022-12-19 11:26:56] <megadryud> he plays for echo and method?
[2022-12-19 11:27:06] <smoochsmoochy> he is in Method now
[2022-12-19 11:27:11] <~%Fragnance> ya entire raids solid
[2022-12-19 11:27:15] <m1sho0> @smoochsmoochy why would he? imo he got disrespected by echo after being asked to retrial

[2022-12-19 11:28:05] <yoyatta> Method is building something quite good, might take another tier or 2 but I think they will be dangerous by the end of DF
[2022-12-19 11:28:45] <smoochsmoochy> i donno, WoD raids were hit and miss

[2022-12-19 11:29:01] <yoyatta> WoD had great raids imo, just too few

[2022-12-19 11:29:47] <yoyatta> lol, I'm not a method fanboy, no reason to bring out the copium comment, I just think some of the ideas they have are quite good
[2022-12-19 11:30:30] <smoochsmoochy> sure, if they their players don't get poached
[2022-12-19 11:30:51] <%$niikita> there's always the risk of that regardless of guild.
[2022-12-19 11:30:51] <@%^Moobot> Yea we on a ramp again, back at > https://www.youtube.com/user/JimmyLandqvist , unprivating & new post inc xo
[2022-12-19 11:31:26] <%$niikita> if more guilds become competitive at the top it just becomes more entertaining to watch the race tbh
[2022-12-19 11:31:28] <elsponx> !spotify
[2022-12-19 11:31:34] <%+kvistordh> @yoyatta the difference here is that method is almost more familiar, while echo is more succes oriented & i think that it could be possible that some players of echo will also switch to method back in the future

[2022-12-19 12:08:41] <%+Dritlukt> i was considering deleting snapchat
[2022-12-19 12:08:47] <@%Leeds> i will bring it and if it gets positive feedback wil lsay i made it myself
[2022-12-19 12:08:50] <%+Dritlukt> but its the best way for me to keep up with old friends
[2022-12-19 12:08:51] <@%Leeds> no chance
[2022-12-19 12:08:56] <@%Leeds> snapchat for the lewd content
[2022-12-19 12:09:04] <!%Gemsplitter> i don't see any use for all these apps
[2022-12-19 12:09:09] <%+Dritlukt> ye lewd content from the bois
[2022-12-19 12:09:13] <%+Dritlukt> idk its like
[2022-12-19 12:09:20] <%+Dritlukt> i dont see why u would refuse to have the apps
[2022-12-19 12:09:33] <%+Dritlukt> its not that big of a deal imo
[2022-12-19 12:09:40] <%+Dritlukt> just have the app, if u use it a lot, use it
[2022-12-19 12:09:42] <%+Dritlukt> if u dont just leave it be
[2022-12-19 12:09:45] <%dyxothegod> gem living in the 40's
[2022-12-19 12:09:45] <%+Dritlukt> is the way i see it
[2022-12-19 12:09:48] <!%Gemsplitter> got whatsapp which i don't even like having and telegram just to keep up with some friends Thinkge
[2022-12-19 12:10:07] <@%Leeds> @Dritlukt no judgment if u enjoy that one
[2022-12-19 12:10:08] <@%Leeds> hehe
[2022-12-19 12:10:10] <!%Gemsplitter> if friends wanna talk to me they can phone my mobile or my landline Madge
[2022-12-19 12:10:18] <%+Dritlukt> i can see not wanting to have the apps if ur genuinely anxious about being tracked and what not
[2022-12-19 12:10:25] <%Evokkr> yeah i dont have a reason to have it no one of my friends use it
[2022-12-19 12:10:34] <@%Leeds> gem has an old phone that can make calls and send text messages only
[2022-12-19 12:10:55] <%+Dritlukt> @Evokkr fair
[2022-12-19 12:11:00] <!%Gemsplitter> na i do have a smartphone PepeLaugh might by a flip phone though thought about it

[2022-12-19 12:11:16] <%+Dritlukt> flip smarthphone 5Head
[2022-12-19 12:11:24] <@%Leeds> idk I am on one hand super "addicted" to apps like instagram but not to post myself but to a) keep up with people i dont  always see and b) follow nice content like hiking stuff or dog stuff etc
[2022-12-19 12:11:28] <%Evokkr> we only see each other at metal concerts and than never talk again till next one xD
[2022-12-19 12:11:45] <@%Leeds> but i feel like kids growing up in the media craziness are mentally fucked by it to soem extend
[2022-12-19 12:11:46] <@%Leeds> the new normal
[2022-12-19 12:11:51] <!%Gemsplitter> but things like snapchat really i just don't see the appeal same with instagram and stuff so i just don't use them cba registering with all these apps aswell
[2022-12-19 12:12:06] <%+Dritlukt> the appeal is just keeping up with people
[2022-12-19 12:12:24] <%+Dritlukt> just like ppl were 20 years ago saying why have a phone, just go meet irl
[2022-12-19 12:12:28] <%+Dritlukt> its the same thing
[2022-12-19 12:12:36] <!%Gemsplitter> i guess yeah

[2022-12-19 12:12:51] <%+Dritlukt> ye thats fair
[2022-12-19 12:13:41] <Omni35> the social media space is kinda bloated, how many apps can 1 person create content for?
[2022-12-19 12:13:43] <!%Gemsplitter> @Leeds they are mentally fucked super short form video and stuff fucking your brain and dopamine receptors to the point where some can't produce it naturally anymore PepeLaugh can be fixed though by unplugging from everything for a while
