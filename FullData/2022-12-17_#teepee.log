[2022-12-17 23:31:25] <%+BubC316> Krampus is the best at any mode. Let’s be real.
[2022-12-17 23:31:27] <rickyyyyk> You are faded
[2022-12-17 23:31:27] <mackeylk> its good on mouse
[2022-12-17 23:31:27] <+j_sanchez23> Krampus on shipment still gives me nightmares
[2022-12-17 23:31:28] <%zapdzl30> i hope krampus never returns
[2022-12-17 23:31:33] <J_Ruby> Krampus needs a contract yesterday
[2022-12-17 23:31:34] <GirouxTangClan_> yeah its hard to use. RPK is just too easy
[2022-12-17 23:31:39] <chexfraggin> theres a reason no recoil guns are always meta
[2022-12-17 23:31:40] <+l3xmachin3> Imagine dying to krampus on a nuke attempt. My monitor would be through the window
[2022-12-17 23:31:41] <TanaSatch> TAQ-V bounces bullet-to-bullet like a fly running away from a swatter. And this is on MnK
[2022-12-17 23:31:48] <AmeliorativeGelato> lookin cute today
[2022-12-17 23:31:49] <sp00dermannnn> who do u favor to win the major?
[2022-12-17 23:31:49] <TheJafaDuck> even pickup rpk is stupid broken
[2022-12-17 23:31:49] <+j_sanchez23> I still prefer the taq 56 over the taq feels more mobile
[2022-12-17 23:31:51] <+likexsmoke> Na theres def recoil on all battle riffles

[2022-12-17 23:32:06] <%+BubC316> Krampus is so bad, he’s good.
[2022-12-17 23:32:12] <TanaSatch> TAQ-V copium
[2022-12-17 23:32:19] <%+Raiderdave242> Teep, do you know the best way to fix the glitch on the buy outs in Warzone? Onlt lets me get 1 of 2 guns
[2022-12-17 23:32:19] <%+muckboi772> These plebs have no idea Teep 🤣
[2022-12-17 23:32:20] <+Marinex5> Have you tried compensating for the recoil (sarcasm)
[2022-12-17 23:32:20] <$bde_broseph> Krampus signed to the South Pole Skuas
[2022-12-17 23:32:24] <Dank_0161> the lachmann lmg is really good i like the fire rate it melt i only use it when i get bored of the RPK

[2022-12-17 23:32:51] <+Heated600> the lachman battle rifle is a 2 shot anywhere in single fire
[2022-12-17 23:32:51] <@%Hyperbeam__> They needed that
[2022-12-17 23:33:01] <+jdogkrueger1994> I still run the taq 56
[2022-12-17 23:33:02] <emzz21> It’s kinda fresh to see an Lmg meta instead of the normal ar/sniper meta think the only real Lmg meta we had was the Bruen
[2022-12-17 23:33:03] <%+BubC316> They Bas-P might be the worst gun in the game.
[2022-12-17 23:33:14] <%+dark_uprising01> 2-3-5 surge???
[2022-12-17 23:33:16] <%+MiggyMxG> great round hyper for your boys

[2022-12-17 23:33:19] <+ACT1ON_FIGURE> Pred picked it up from last game
[2022-12-17 23:33:20] <J_Ruby> Losing a nuke to Krampus would be better than dev error.. unless?
