[2023-01-06 12:36:47] <@^Nightbot> Me everytime I remember that I was 10 cm away from falling down from a mountain when I went climbing, It shows how deadly and dangerous 10 cm can be. But when you think about it even 6cm is alot, 10cm is way over average. Especially when the 10 cm is funny and goes to the gym.
