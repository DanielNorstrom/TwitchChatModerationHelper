[2022-12-25 17:16:36] <+jguttman1> A sub-par bed could affect you in the long term, if you keep sleeping  on it.
[2022-12-25 17:16:36] <argh_muh_back> @Blinkx_ maybe you havent worked hard enough to need the extra comfort

[2022-12-25 17:28:33] <%Warfiend81> @InfinityKitty51 I would just suggest if youre concerned you would need to look up your particular mattress and see if there are known issues.  Unfortunately most companies who do that kind of stuff probably arent going to make it readily known they are using it

[2022-12-25 19:18:20] <%Warfiend81> Its probably because the connected track is to low.  If you disconnect the track before you move it it will probably go up more
