[2022-12-31 13:55:32] <dvsimple> one of the reasons why i loved a GRs was game variety, doing marathon game-by-game has variety but doing 2 regions in DS1 and then jumping to something else increases that, maybe it doesnt work, just trying to seem smart :D

[2022-12-31 14:22:46] <TysonJDevereaux> Spell disparity is still a thing from what I hear. Catch Flame is a starter spell and can last to the very end for some, yet some later-game spells are useless from what I hear
[2022-12-31 14:22:46] <%Bubalgebra> But you're not leveled so don't be suprised if it has low damage

[2022-12-31 14:35:58] <%+alexcon18> can you jump the teleports? or do you always have to dodge them?

[2022-12-31 14:36:02] <%d0nnerheim> u could off hand black flame dagger und duo with the rot dagger

[2022-12-31 14:36:48] <%Ixdex1> if you take poison off it stacks rot faster i think, not sure that's worth tho

[2022-12-31 14:37:12] <%meinMestar> You can boost some weapons status buildup like that
[2022-12-31 14:37:17] <%falloutsavannah> Poisoned was buffed though so it‚Äôs better now

[2022-12-31 14:37:27] <%RahdeeeLOA> rot stays at 50 buildup regardless of art iirc
[2022-12-31 14:37:29] <%SmoogerzZ> Rot does good damage to him if you can get him there he just has high resistance

[2022-12-31 14:37:48] <%Bubalgebra> Use kindred talisman. it will boost ALL damage by a lot if poison or rot is inflicted in the area'

[2022-12-31 14:37:53] <%+alexcon18> can you equip the kindred of rot exaultation talisman while using the rapier? cause that thing would give you 20% dmg bonus while he is poisoned and/or curse rotten
[2022-12-31 14:37:59] <%+KeefMasterFlx> it was a great try
[2022-12-31 14:38:08] <%meinMestar> I think you probably have it

[2022-12-31 14:38:32] <%Ixdex1> that one ye
[2022-12-31 14:38:34] <TysonJDevereaux> you can boost the antspur rapier with black flame blade

[2022-12-31 14:40:22] <Toguro009> @Toguro009 i think yes
[2022-12-31 14:40:28] <+Sirhaddock> kindred of rot already ran out by the looks of it
[2022-12-31 14:40:29] <%+alexcon18> yeah the mushroom crown would be 10% more dmg boosting
[2022-12-31 14:40:32] <TysonJDevereaux> if you remove the poison from the rapier, you can apply black flame blade to it
[2022-12-31 14:40:45] <%meinMestar> Oh yeah you can't BOOST rot you can only add another status that lowers rot
[2022-12-31 14:40:50] <lucy_frye> do debuffs last forever? I don't even know.

[2022-12-31 14:45:01] <TysonJDevereaux> It gets applied very quickly to the weapon, but 7-8 seconds is hella low
[2022-12-31 14:45:04] <personalindividual> At least try it

[2022-12-31 14:45:21] <%falloutsavannah> Just keep going what you are doing and just put on the mushroom crown and it will boost your Damage more with rot

[2022-12-31 14:46:15] <+Sirhaddock> rot talisman not worth it over something else
[2022-12-31 14:46:30] <%$Doudoussin> Maybe if you put all the talismans you don't use in the chest, you can quickly switch the kindred for the scorpion during his slow slams attack ?

[2022-12-31 14:46:34] <%meinMestar> No

[2022-12-31 14:47:02] <TysonJDevereaux> Just black flames in general, mostly tornado from what I hear

[2022-12-31 14:56:18] <%+unagiro> won't he get a cold if you keep changing temperatures like that?
[2022-12-31 14:56:24] <AzaZ_ow> he will probably just parry it
[2022-12-31 14:56:28] <%Lickers__> he will parry black flame sometimes
[2022-12-31 14:56:29] <ventyog> looll
[2022-12-31 14:56:33] <%Mellon_> he's really weak to posture damage
[2022-12-31 14:56:46] <randomusername86> Is it better to be set up for Elden Beast or Radagon? Is there s et up which works for both?
[2022-12-31 14:56:46] <Allrounder98> You could use the black flame spell on your weapon
[2022-12-31 14:56:51] <Allrounder98> You should have the stats for it I think

[2022-12-31 15:14:09] <TysonJDevereaux> from 40 to 10 poise damage in one patch, fromsoft gutted it
[2022-12-31 15:14:15] <RuzovyKnedlik> hi! I was about to ask if this is a no hit run... then I realized that at lvl 1 it basically IS a no hit run lol. Good luck!
[2022-12-31 15:14:18] <%+unagiro> parry him Clueless
[2022-12-31 15:14:21] <%Zormi> I know that was just for the meme
[2022-12-31 15:14:27] <@%Sarah88_66> lets try everything
[2022-12-31 15:14:41] <+ATONAT_> Lion‚Äôs claw ash of war is pretty good for poise damage

[2022-12-31 15:14:46] <%$SteveBob104> I always use Frost for Raddy, you could try stagger into Tornado I guess
[2022-12-31 15:14:51] <@%Sarah88_66> lets try everything AT ONCE
[2022-12-31 15:14:52] <%MrNinja1234> Parry and then riposte
[2022-12-31 15:14:53] <%ErrSousa> square off may not be fast enough, worth trying tho
[2022-12-31 15:14:58] <%Zormi> If you dont know what you're doing how will the boss know
[2022-12-31 15:14:59] <TysonJDevereaux> parry, stagger and then black flame. But you need 3 parries to stagger
[2022-12-31 15:15:12] <%$SteveBob104> Yeah Lion's Claw is good, but it's better on enemies you can pancake
[2022-12-31 15:15:19] <%ArhamSAA> try the hammer, Radagon is way weaker to strike damage than thrust but black flame is still your best option

[2022-12-31 16:03:37] <%LankSSBM> you should try some charge R2 with the dagger, it does 24 poise, so you can get some staggers fairly reliably. it's fast enough to punish with on a lot of attacks

[2022-12-31 16:18:31] <%RahdeeeLOA> @cleano_mcbeano it's a customizable special flask. one time use

[2022-12-31 16:18:38] <%remiri> this guy is the woooorst LOL

[2022-12-31 16:18:45] <%noobvsbosses> Happy new year chat! Happy birthday Nico!
[2022-12-31 16:19:01] <%RahdeeeLOA> @cleano_mcbeano one time use, then you have to recharge it at a grace. so essentially one time per boss fight
[2022-12-31 16:19:04] <Kallen2g> u dont
[2022-12-31 16:19:04] <%meinMestar> That teleport is double insta roll isn't it
[2022-12-31 16:19:05] <%Dooglie> is magic not an option?
[2022-12-31 16:19:05] <@%voax> the teleport has a slight delay
[2022-12-31 16:19:11] <esbiem96> For me in RL1/SL1, SoC is still the hardest for me. I just cant master him. Only beat him once or twice in all these years (I know this is RL1+0 run)
[2022-12-31 16:19:12] <%$SteveBob104> I missed it. What? Hmmm

[2022-12-31 16:19:15] <%ErrSousa> It's a very late roll but it's super hard to get
[2022-12-31 16:19:19] <%remiri> the quick teleport will always be behind him, if it is near you it is always delayed
[2022-12-31 16:19:20] <%$SteveBob104> Ah yeah that's tough
[2022-12-31 16:19:21] <Soopa__> Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge

[2022-12-31 16:19:39] <%meinMestar> Depends when you do the first one but what i do i just listen for the teleport and double roll

[2022-12-31 16:19:42] <%DATMOTION> maybe distance in 2nd phase
[2022-12-31 16:19:42] <%ErrSousa> @remiri ^^
[2022-12-31 16:19:45] <%remiri> main rule of the teleport is to expect it to be delayed
[2022-12-31 16:19:46] <@%voax> happy new years as well DemonSlayerAsta

[2022-12-31 16:20:33] <%ItsYeAce> you can do it, it just takes time
[2022-12-31 16:20:33] <%remiri> teleport near you is always delayed with the same timing
[2022-12-31 16:20:34] <%ErrSousa> most likely yes foya
[2022-12-31 16:20:39] <%remiri> thats all i mean
[2022-12-31 16:20:45] <%meinMestar> remiri it's pretty easy to time if that rhythm is ingrained in your head, but it's easy to be thrown off when it comes suddenly
[2022-12-31 16:20:49] <%$SteveBob104> BHS? If he can teleport, so can you YEP

[2022-12-31 17:27:42] <hemiak> It feels that way. Like the ground slam feels like it should be safe to punish, and then he turns it into the up swing. Which feels safe, and then he does something else. WutFace
[2022-12-31 17:27:44] <TysonJDevereaux> Maybe use... a summon?

[2022-12-31 17:28:08] <%$SteveBob104> I don't think Mizazaki intended this run, but worth a try KEKL
[2022-12-31 17:28:24] <TysonJDevereaux> @SteveBob104 Sometimes I think that Miyazaki looked at certain challenge runs and took offense

[2022-12-31 17:28:56] <TysonJDevereaux> Miyazaki himself is apparently a masochist
[2022-12-31 17:29:06] <%remiri> is poison better than cold or is antspur still bugged
[2022-12-31 17:29:10] <hemiak> Tbf it is good that the final boss is the biggest challenge. Ignoring the fish because the true final boss when they have one is almost always like an afterthought.
[2022-12-31 17:29:22] <%remiri> i know it was bugged to remove rot buildup when cold prefix was applied
[2022-12-31 17:29:27] <hemiak> Stares at moon presence.

[2022-12-31 17:29:43] <%+hochivinh> You can use chilling mist aow and still have regular infusion
[2022-12-31 17:29:50] <+PandariX_Gaming> Is he Routing or is it actually the last boss with no hits?
[2022-12-31 17:30:01] <%remiri> well he is using poison infusion now
[2022-12-31 17:30:02] <hemiak> It isn‚Äôt a hitless run.
[2022-12-31 17:30:03] <%+encode1g> @dinossindgeil Do you have any weapon in mind for infusing it with black flame blade

[2022-12-31 17:30:31] <%Lickers__> @PandariX_Gaming it's a challenge run all bosses level 1 and no weapon upgrades
[2022-12-31 17:30:31] <%remiri> try cold infusion instead of poison i think that is more dmg, but antspur may be bugged
[2022-12-31 17:30:32] <TysonJDevereaux> Fire's Deadly Sin with Black Flame Blade?
[2022-12-31 17:30:34] <%$SteveBob104> I know it doesn't help a huge amount, but I promise you you can outrange his grab if you sprint away and you should then get a free cast YEP
[2022-12-31 17:30:46] <%+encode1g> @dinossindgeil Do you have any weapon in mind for infusing it with black flame blade , it's 17 faith
[2022-12-31 17:30:56] <TysonJDevereaux> Fire's Deadly Sin with Black Flame Blade? I can't think of anything else
[2022-12-31 17:31:01] <kboc2> What is better, Bloodborne or Sekiro?
[2022-12-31 17:31:07] <Maniac_Engineer> agree with fire's deadly sin and black flame blade
[2022-12-31 17:31:18] <%ErrSousa> @SteveBob104 You can probably also cast as he's doing it because you can punish there
[2022-12-31 17:31:22] <TysonJDevereaux> If you use fire's deadly sin and put black flame blade on dagger, the fire's deadly sin gets the black flame effect also. hope that is intended
[2022-12-31 17:31:22] <hemiak> Radagon took me a bunch of tries on my regular run. EB took like three attempts.
