[2022-12-31 06:05:51] <%Dr_LuBuFu> Hit the 1300s dead zone.  kinda sucks
[2022-12-31 06:06:03] <ZehroOG> missing a variety of cards ?

[2022-12-31 06:06:54] <%+jascallion> what kind of deck do you think you'd enjoy playing if you had the cards?
[2022-12-31 06:07:43] <!%kingcharles__69> i understand what you're saying with the card frustration. the worst part for me is that I dont have the counter cards to popular decks
[2022-12-31 06:07:46] <ZehroOG> hum .. ok good to know
[2022-12-31 06:07:58] <!%kingcharles__69> like not having patriot sucks, but to me not having the counter card to patriot sucks more if that makes sense
[2022-12-31 06:08:02] <ACGsteve> have you played I think it's called clash royal

[2022-12-31 06:12:40] <%+jascallion> storm + juggernaut is a solid combo to sort of lock down a lane
[2022-12-31 06:12:41] <!%kingcharles__69> zola generally dunks on the leader decks though

[2022-12-31 07:47:43] <!%$WrathOfCathy> i agree with pressure but it took me a bit to pick

[2022-12-31 08:30:16] <partnu> DK is struggling in constructed, not compared to warrior and priest, and struggling in arena which is so interesting to see and must be such a juggle when it comes to balancing
[2022-12-31 08:30:17] <zeddtinn> Blobby is a nice kid.
[2022-12-31 08:30:46] <partnu> not struggling * in arena lol
[2022-12-31 08:30:59] <zeddtinn> they did a great a job making DK tbh, could of easily been screwed up.

[2022-12-31 08:31:25] <!Isherwood> a lot of folks see correlation between balance and fun, but I smell what you are stepping in
[2022-12-31 08:31:32] <partnu> at the same time the game probably wouldnt be as fun if every deck had a 50% win rate
[2022-12-31 08:31:41] <%Synastar> Dk is so fucked, your unstoppable
[2022-12-31 08:31:42] <!Isherwood> part of fun would being able to choose your fave class and not feel dumpstered
[2022-12-31 08:31:56] <%+Remster101> Well they nailed the DK flavor/fun, it just isn't balanced well in constructed or arena
[2022-12-31 08:32:09] <!Isherwood> 45-55% should maybe the aimable goal at minimum?
[2022-12-31 08:32:29] <%+Remster101> i think it's obvious they overcorrected from DH release, and didn't care about arena on launch
[2022-12-31 08:32:34] <%Kaguyavn> I tried Warrior and it was absolutely miserable... idk how u do so well with it
[2022-12-31 08:32:38] <%Synastar> They said they try and get it to within 3%
[2022-12-31 08:32:52] <%Synastar> So 47-53 is what they try for
[2022-12-31 08:32:57] <zeddtinn> @Synastar is DK really fucked? it is a very fun class to play, the other classes just need to follow suit, which is i think is very hard to do
[2022-12-31 08:33:00] <!Isherwood> btw I summoned an actived package runner today I want that card back!
[2022-12-31 08:33:11] <Maldekaiser> @RedBeard that was the issue they wanted to solve in BG aswell, to always have atleast 1 decent WR for each player  so you don't draft 2/4 bad heroes
