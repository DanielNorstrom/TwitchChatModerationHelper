[2022-12-23 00:24:18] <Bilwitz> the expansion was weak with a small number of egregious outliers
[2022-12-23 00:24:21] <Elijahhhgaming> is Quest demon hunter good still?
[2022-12-23 00:24:34] <+ryanj286> @Bilwitz best way to put it 100% agree
[2022-12-23 00:24:59] <+ryanj286> cards from the xpac are either absolutetly unplayable or incredibly broken
[2022-12-23 00:25:15] <+DraganDE> i wish there was a good unholy dk list
[2022-12-23 00:25:17] <Bilwitz> I think almost every card in the undead tribe needs a buff

[2022-12-23 01:28:15] <bizjeet5> the mine dies it does 4 directly. that deathrattle attaches to the devourer. when you shallow grave him that mine deathrattle goes off twice more
[2022-12-23 01:28:23] <PPetition> 2 mines dies = 8 dmg, it gives 8 dmg deathrattle to devourer (procced via shallow grave) up to 16 in total, devourer with 2 mine deathrattle dies and does 24 in total?

[2022-12-23 01:31:54] <bizjeet5> why is this so hard to understand. you grimoire 2 mines individually. 8 damage. 8 damage in deathrattles goes onto the devourer who already himself has a 4 damage deathrattle on, that 12 damage in deathrattles goes off twice doing 24. so 24 from the devourer dying from shallow grave, plus 8 from the original mine deaths

[2022-12-23 02:06:33] <%huntstv> It wasn't from scratch per se, I was able to look at old quest hunter decks from when it was viable and try to fit it to work with the current meta and current cards
[2022-12-23 02:07:12] <%huntstv> I tried some of the arcane stuff but I don't think there's enough arcane spells that are good enough to make it worth it. The old school style with traps might be more playable now since I've been seeing more imp locks
[2022-12-23 02:07:26] <%huntstv> but I'm also at like 7k rating so it might as well not even be the same meta as what you face

[2022-12-23 04:29:32] <bimo_72> I think you should run the 3 mana spell that destroys random enemy minion when you play or discard it

[2022-12-23 04:37:44] <%SchiffersGaming> Would love to see a restriction where you can't have less than 2 copies of a card in your deck - No 1's, including legendaries. Would have to be an epic card though, because otherwise it would restrict itself.
