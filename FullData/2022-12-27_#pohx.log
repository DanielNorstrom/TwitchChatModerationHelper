[2022-12-27 16:20:56] <%kabawave> @furai_ttv should be ok, fire multi is a good modifier to look for also, but it depends on your burning dmg and stuff, put the item in your character's POB (not guide) to see if it's an upgrade.

[2022-12-27 16:38:45] <GregRamner> Really been enjoying the atlas/mapping strategy you made a video on. Big fan of delve, so although I don’t think you were actually running the delve, I’ve been mixing that in for some variety
[2022-12-27 16:38:52] <EleventyTen> yeah its kinda scuffed but im getting the 25% so ill upgrade it later!

[2022-12-27 18:13:01] <%the_immortal_arab> its actually pretty noticable imo
[2022-12-27 18:13:08] <phadac> then yea its the first and only one they do, i feel less resolve damage really
[2022-12-27 18:13:37] <phadac> xdd
[2022-12-27 18:13:58] <nightknight4455> that's how i track if i got hit, "o shit endurance charges are up"
[2022-12-27 18:13:59] <phadac> but yea league is rough for some archtypes
[2022-12-27 18:14:01] <Lyrantes> I dislike that you basically want to go full glasscannon, like sure you can still die for real in Sanctum but chances are you won't
[2022-12-27 18:14:13] <+neolibz> what do you think is one of the better builds for Sanctum specifically?

[2022-12-27 18:15:23] <%vianadota> did you regret that burrito the next day ?
[2022-12-27 18:15:29] <%vianadota> that rice* burrito
[2022-12-27 18:15:40] <%vianadota> the 2 for 1
[2022-12-27 18:15:43] <Lyrantes> I'm glad that Sanctum is so incredibly rewarding though, if it wasn't I'd probably be skipping it by now

[2022-12-27 18:16:26] <ryuko_matoi_meows> hi pohx, if they nerf rf to oblivion what skill would you play instead?
[2022-12-27 18:16:26] <marxxxwell> u cant get green on that bro
[2022-12-27 18:16:30] <%+Versuchh> how does this socket crafting trick work? Basically just using jewelers to recolor instead of chromas?
[2022-12-27 18:16:38] <+DoubleMeatTreat> Shouldn’t you color green first
[2022-12-27 18:16:47] <+DoubleMeatTreat> And then do the sockets?
[2022-12-27 18:16:55] <marxxxwell> u should color green first

[2022-12-27 18:17:01] <%+Versuchh> ez
[2022-12-27 18:17:01] <%vianadota> i know... but i really don't wanna compare myself with you at your best.

[2022-12-27 18:17:39] <+TitaniumFoxx> i didnt think of using the jewellers socket recipe to change colors if you lacked chromes, thats great

[2022-12-27 18:18:43] <Lyrantes> Playing your build has downside for me personally, every single other build now feels waaay too squishy LuL

[2022-12-27 18:25:51] <kilimanziaro> just let us save 32 rooms for a full sanctum, and then its a great league

[2022-12-27 18:28:16] <%Herz93> heist was not that popular during heist league but its still got in to core
[2022-12-27 18:28:27] <+Deedledo> i didnt get my safels til like 2 3 days ago
[2022-12-27 18:28:28] <+Deedledo> lol
[2022-12-27 18:28:45] <+Telmorra> Heist is also optional but you still feel forced to do it for alternate gems or you throw away a lot of power.
[2022-12-27 18:28:47] <%+tecknogyk> I didn't like it on my RF character at first but once I got some relics it became way easier and don't mind it with the RF character now.
[2022-12-27 18:28:47] <+sauceoftx> heist is great
[2022-12-27 18:28:50] <+Deedledo> i had a pretty nice armour based max res shield wit ht1 regen tho
[2022-12-27 18:28:50] <Lyrantes> Maybe this League is beta testing for a lab overhaul Kapp

[2022-12-27 18:29:52] <%+tecknogyk> I think it's fine for a league mechanic to favor certain builds.  Heist is the same way and it's fine.
[2022-12-27 18:29:57] <caddrf> I'm following your guide and doing red maps with tabula with no issues

[2022-12-27 18:32:09] <%+tecknogyk> I love RF for league start but it's personal choice really.  I like it because of how tanky it is and it's good for running maps.
[2022-12-27 18:32:41] <mathophile> You could also start with rf and gather gear up for a 2nd characteer.
[2022-12-27 18:32:41] <Lyrantes> @tecknogyk Honestly same, mapping is my favourite part of the gameplay loop and with RF it's incredibly fun

[2022-12-27 18:37:51] <+Xxbambam223xX> RF has been a very rewarding build to play. Very easy to follow and scale
[2022-12-27 18:37:54] <%SearingDarkness> Game devs dont really balance around things that are fun its about how much it skews the game in some way such as fucking the markets or diversity
[2022-12-27 18:38:06] <%Herz93> he can talk without moving his lips KEKW
[2022-12-27 18:38:07] <%$Esord> rf is like a gold standard, doesn't excel at anything, but is comfy and does most things reasonably well
[2022-12-27 18:38:09] <Lyrantes> RF is a good skill and your guide makes it great. If anything they should nerf you Susge

[2022-12-27 18:42:31] <%vianadota> not many people can drink gin from a bottle and not pass out, that's already a skill.
[2022-12-27 18:42:33] <@%donavanshepard> Acetyl-L-tyrosine is an amino acid, an N-acetyl derivative of tyrosine. It is used for parenteral nutrition and as a dietary supplemen

[2022-12-27 18:43:09] <%SearingDarkness> It surprised me a little when I first learned how it isnt common for people to just know when to stop drinking
[2022-12-27 18:43:15] <%vianadota> @vianadota being slavic is a skill.
[2022-12-27 18:43:24] <%+Thelius42> honestly lots of water and 2 tylenol before bed does the trick
[2022-12-27 18:43:24] <%vianadota> there it is
[2022-12-27 18:43:28] <+rootfayth> yeah I mean known side effect of alcohol is although you can feel like you slept like a baby, the deep sleep recovery is just not there
[2022-12-27 18:43:32] <%vianadota> I actually think you should drink some water and it can help.

[2022-12-27 18:43:49] <%SearingDarkness> @Thelius42 For me just the water really works. I typically drink 1.5x water to alcohol

[2022-12-27 18:44:13] <sussy_cheeks> drinking water after drinking (and before you go to bed) is the best thing you can do vs hangover, most of it is just dehydration

[2022-12-27 19:29:44] <BousZ> Hello Pohx, i was looking on the FAQ for the timeless jewel you were using and i couldnt find anything, is it a high priority?
[2022-12-27 19:29:51] <Lyrantes> @AMR_Tetsu Exarch has the "monsters gain 80% fire res" mod sometimes and Eater only has Cold and Lightning
[2022-12-27 19:30:10] <@%lemoncoolers> @AMR_Tetsu searing mobs often resist fire damage and eater mobs do not so that alone makes eater much more preferrable

[2022-12-27 19:30:27] <AMR_Tetsu> @Lyrantes i see so its better farming on eater of worlds then

[2022-12-27 20:18:34] <@%GoGoLoThirty> The scouts will kill stuff before they get close, the burn kills stuff that’s stunlocked. The scout towers have more trouble with immune than the burning meteor
