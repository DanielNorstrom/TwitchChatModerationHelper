[2022-12-27 16:20:56] <%kabawave> @furai_ttv should be ok, fire multi is a good modifier to look for also, but it depends on your burning dmg and stuff, put the item in your character's POB (not guide) to see if it's an upgrade.

[2022-12-27 16:38:45] <GregRamner> Really been enjoying the atlas/mapping strategy you made a video on. Big fan of delve, so although I donât think you were actually running the delve, Iâve been mixing that in for some variety
[2022-12-27 16:38:52] <EleventyTen> yeah its kinda scuffed but im getting the 25% so ill upgrade it later!

[2022-12-27 17:53:37] <%SearingDarkness> @dynameme Like no joke I couldnt move because the waypoint was the only solid ground below me and I couldnt delete it smh idk anymore
[2022-12-27 17:53:41] <Weppas> heist is always a nice source of raw currency like regrets and scours
[2022-12-27 17:53:48] <@%Kilal2> ^
[2022-12-27 17:53:58] <kagens> I also crafted a pair of gloves with fear ess, flat regen, increased life reg % armor all t2 and crafted life on it
[2022-12-27 17:53:59] <%Fattness132> Heist or Expedition-Tujen will give you a ton of usable currency
[2022-12-27 17:54:00] <@%Kilal2> yeah that is definitely one good thing about heist
[2022-12-27 17:54:00] <Lyvcan> defiled cathedral drops an innocence theme card rewarding 40 regrets

[2022-12-27 17:55:33] <+TitaniumFoxx> @Gargzorz map mods probably, less regen, less res, eldritch altars, etc
[2022-12-27 17:55:37] <+Gargzorz> no its not on map mod
[2022-12-27 17:55:49] <+ItzNaru1> I spent so many points in the wrong way lol. trying to fix it back to the proper points but at lv 38 and cant clear bosses solo anymore

[2022-12-27 18:13:01] <%the_immortal_arab> its actually pretty noticable imo
[2022-12-27 18:13:08] <phadac> then yea its the first and only one they do, i feel less resolve damage really
[2022-12-27 18:13:37] <phadac> xdd
[2022-12-27 18:13:58] <nightknight4455> that's how i track if i got hit, "o shit endurance charges are up"
[2022-12-27 18:13:59] <phadac> but yea league is rough for some archtypes
[2022-12-27 18:14:01] <Lyrantes> I dislike that you basically want to go full glasscannon, like sure you can still die for real in Sanctum but chances are you won't

[2022-12-27 18:16:38] <+DoubleMeatTreat> Shouldnât you color green first
[2022-12-27 18:16:47] <+DoubleMeatTreat> And then do the sockets?

[2022-12-27 18:28:28] <+Deedledo> lol
[2022-12-27 18:28:45] <+Telmorra> Heist is also optional but you still feel forced to do it for alternate gems or you throw away a lot of power.
[2022-12-27 18:28:47] <%+tecknogyk> I didn't like it on my RF character at first but once I got some relics it became way easier and don't mind it with the RF character now.
[2022-12-27 18:28:47] <+sauceoftx> heist is great
[2022-12-27 18:28:50] <+Deedledo> i had a pretty nice armour based max res shield wit ht1 regen tho

[2022-12-27 18:32:09] <%+tecknogyk> I love RF for league start but it's personal choice really.  I like it because of how tanky it is and it's good for running maps.
[2022-12-27 18:32:41] <mathophile> You could also start with rf and gather gear up for a 2nd characteer.

[2022-12-27 18:37:51] <+Xxbambam223xX> RF has been a very rewarding build to play. Very easy to follow and scale
[2022-12-27 18:37:54] <%SearingDarkness> Game devs dont really balance around things that are fun its about how much it skews the game in some way such as fucking the markets or diversity

[2022-12-27 18:38:07] <%$Esord> rf is like a gold standard, doesn't excel at anything, but is comfy and does most things reasonably well
[2022-12-27 18:38:09] <Lyrantes> RF is a good skill and your guide makes it great. If anything they should nerf you Susge

[2022-12-27 18:42:31] <%vianadota> not many people can drink gin from a bottle and not pass out, that's already a skill.
[2022-12-27 18:42:33] <@%donavanshepard> Acetyl-L-tyrosine is an amino acid, an N-acetyl derivative of tyrosine. It is used for parenteral nutrition and as a dietary supplemen

[2022-12-27 18:43:09] <%SearingDarkness> It surprised me a little when I first learned how it isnt common for people to just know when to stop drinking
[2022-12-27 18:43:15] <%vianadota> @vianadota being slavic is a skill.
[2022-12-27 18:43:24] <%+Thelius42> honestly lots of water and 2 tylenol before bed does the trick
[2022-12-27 18:43:24] <%vianadota> there it is
[2022-12-27 18:43:28] <+rootfayth> yeah I mean known side effect of alcohol is although you can feel like you slept like a baby, the deep sleep recovery is just not there
[2022-12-27 18:43:32] <%vianadota> I actually think you should drink some water and it can help.

[2022-12-27 18:44:13] <sussy_cheeks> drinking water after drinking (and before you go to bed) is the best thing you can do vs hangover, most of it is just dehydration

[2022-12-27 19:29:44] <BousZ> Hello Pohx, i was looking on the FAQ for the timeless jewel you were using and i couldnt find anything, is it a high priority?
[2022-12-27 19:29:51] <Lyrantes> @AMR_Tetsu Exarch has the "monsters gain 80% fire res" mod sometimes and Eater only has Cold and Lightning
[2022-12-27 19:30:10] <@%lemoncoolers> @AMR_Tetsu searing mobs often resist fire damage and eater mobs do not so that alone makes eater much more preferrable

[2022-12-27 20:18:34] <@%GoGoLoThirty> The scouts will kill stuff before they get close, the burn kills stuff thatâs stunlocked. The scout towers have more trouble with immune than the burning meteor
