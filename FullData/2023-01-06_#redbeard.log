[2023-01-06 07:09:06] <%ublighthero> could give putricied
[2023-01-06 07:09:06] <!%$vaktor12> sprint into putricide

[2023-01-06 07:16:01] <%$SFWildBill> Microwave it for like 2 minutes and them bake for an hour - the skins are delicious and the most healthy part
[2023-01-06 07:16:10] <%Knamliss> otterJAM
[2023-01-06 07:16:14] <+mattycharchar> Clean it, cut it into quarters, brush them with vegetable oil, hit them with salt and pepper, throw it in the oven for like 30-40 minutes. Delicious.
[2023-01-06 07:16:31] <%$SFWildBill> Baked skin is better
[2023-01-06 07:16:32] <%Knamliss> There's a huge debate on whether or not you boil it with skin on or off

[2023-01-06 11:09:57] <+mooseturd> ‚ÄúLet's suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream that you wanted to dream. And that you could, for example, have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time. Or any length of time you wanted to have. And you would, naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say ...
[2023-01-06 11:10:09] <+mooseturd> you would say "Well, that was pretty great." But now let's have a surprise. Let's have a dream which isn't under control. Where something is gonna happen to me that I don't know what it's going to be. And you would dig that and come out of that and say "Wow, that was a close shave, wasn't it?" And then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream. And finally, you would dream ... where you are now.
[2023-01-06 11:10:15] <+massanviewbot6969> What does it mean if you don‚Äôt dream at night? I get stoned and just have a deep sleep every night

[2023-01-06 11:12:52] <%$mrfisher101> Alcohol is terrible for your sleep. Same is weed. They are both sedatives so great for helping you fall asleep, but they are also messing with your deep sleep so they arent great for  giving you a good nights sleep

[2023-01-06 11:13:37] <%$SFWildBill> if you drink or smoke and you quit or stay up really late you will have whats called REM rebound and have insane dreams. Substance induced sleep has way less REM even though it feels deeper its not as good for you.

[2023-01-06 11:14:47] <%$mrfisher101> @massanviewbot6969 it's obviously different for everyone. I would like to say that the type of weed you smoke also makes it easier to wake up in the morning. Typically pot and skunk are milder on your mental, but I used to smoke hash and that kinda made me very tired in the morning

[2023-01-06 12:30:09] <+F_Ivanovic> i don't like the high variance nature of doomsayer. cause sometimes it wins a game if it goes off and other times it loses you the game if your opponent can answer it effectively
[2023-01-06 12:30:28] <zeddtinn> arms dealer is really good with malignant, yeah

[2023-01-06 13:30:33] <%talrielz> the high school experience there tortured him enough that his art turned out that way?
[2023-01-06 13:31:00] <Comeo> No joke.. my mom went to school with Burton, says he was picked on by water polo players.. and the opening of Wednesday had the kid picked on by water polo players
[2023-01-06 13:31:10] <Comeo> So yes Tal!  I think that's true
