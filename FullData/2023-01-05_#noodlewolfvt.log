[2023-01-05 00:00:26] <b0rn2beagod> hehe bouncy eyes mishbaO mishbaO
[2023-01-05 00:00:46] <stratosedge> It's just 12 episodes 20-24 minutes each it won't take long to watch.
[2023-01-05 00:01:26] <b0rn2beagod> damn bro I want a calzone

[2023-01-05 00:01:50] <%+jjpowerman> O wow a different background, looks nice
[2023-01-05 00:02:01] <creeprgenesis> did you hear about the nfl player that dropped dead, like heart completely stopped, during yesterdays game?
[2023-01-05 00:02:13] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> i havent followed the entire conversation so i dont know if this anime was mentioned. but some friends of mine baited me into watching madoka magica...
[2023-01-05 00:02:21] <creeprgenesis> fortunately they were succesful with cpr
[2023-01-05 00:02:33] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> they said ti was a nice magical girl anime

[2023-01-05 00:03:11] <%$Dio444777> i heard about it. was crazy. my friend is super upset about it cause he lives in cincinatti and is a huge bengals fan
[2023-01-05 00:03:19] <stratosedge> @TheRobertSentByCyberlife I haven't watched it yet but I heard it was good.
[2023-01-05 00:03:23] <%+Draile_Runescar> If you want a good magical girl anime i would whole hearted suggest Lyrical magical nanoha
[2023-01-05 00:03:30] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> @stratosedge ow its VERY good, just euhm... dark :P

[2023-01-05 00:03:34] <%+jjpowerman> madoka magica, that was so fun to watch, and telling a friend it magic girl, that sounds like a good idea
[2023-01-05 00:03:53] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> ow its magical girl
[2023-01-05 00:03:55] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> but VERY dark :p
[2023-01-05 00:04:25] <stratosedge> It's the dark side of magical girls, the side without the make up.
[2023-01-05 00:04:26] <+VioletAurora463> Modoka is definitely one of the better magical girl anime
[2023-01-05 00:04:35] <%TheRobertSentByCyberlife> same but i did enjoy little witch academia and they said it was similar
[2023-01-05 00:04:35] <%+Draile_Runescar> Nahnoha is a more serious magical girl anime
[2023-01-05 00:04:38] <creeprgenesis> apparently my dad said that in the past couple of months over 1000 people have just dropped dead, for no reason

[2023-01-05 00:08:11] <%$Dio444777> the covid vaccines do have known side effects. sadly they weren't known about when the vaccines were released because of the way they were fast tracked

[2023-01-05 00:56:43] <%$catfromavoid> Speaking of loud pops that sounds like a gunshot, when I was in high school I brought a bag of balloons to school and wanted to see how loud it would be in the gym, then popped like 6 in the bathroom, a teacher was running around the halls looking for a shooter
[2023-01-05 00:56:59] <%lunarlens> that also is disappointing.  There is some packing material that has what looks like full bubble wrap, but only has the top side with the domes.

[2023-01-05 23:04:11] <%reivehnfliyt> Fishnet is nice, Especially where it slips over thighs and it slightly indents, it exaggerates thiccness and has a cheeky-sultry vibe.
