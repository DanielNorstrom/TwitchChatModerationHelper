[2022-12-25 02:46:30] <TurtleFactz> üê¢ Did you know that turtles can feel when you touch their shell? A turtle's shell is really just a modified ribcage, and there are nerves and a blood supply that exist throughout it. Turtles also enjoy certain tactile sensations on their shell, like running water and scratching. If you've ever seen a turtle wiggling from side to side during rainfall or when being scratched, this is likely the reason why! üê¢
