[2022-12-15 18:08:44] <+theanup007> Is this  early area in this game? I have not played it yet
[2022-12-15 18:08:45] <%Whurleygig> there is sort of a rocket launcher
[2022-12-15 18:08:46] <dutch_van_der_linde2> this lad is mad
[2022-12-15 18:08:46] <%+crowteinmilk> need a 4x to see the combos
[2022-12-15 18:08:48] <%ZCrimes> some bosses have 3 phases, even 4
[2022-12-15 18:08:48] <Crash__7> just spam hitting with ur normal attack not jump attack
[2022-12-15 18:08:50] <%$DBauernf> @BreaK Whatever you do, don't watch speed runs of this game on YT.
[2022-12-15 18:08:52] <%+SirParr> roll into him when you dodge
[2022-12-15 18:08:53] <%Mykl3> DANEsen no, I don't think it'll be until next week :)
[2022-12-15 18:08:53] <%Kezzran> @Mykl3 Did it already wipe???
[2022-12-15 18:08:53] <Crash__7> @crowteinmilk LUL
[2022-12-15 18:08:54] <%+CharonHendrix> Honestly rolling towards him will help a lot, as you get caught when you roll backwards
[2022-12-15 18:09:00] <%Mykl3> Kezzran no :)
[2022-12-15 18:09:04] <+dingus_maximus> I was just like you when I started
[2022-12-15 18:09:05] <%ZCrimes> this is the lowest boss yes
[2022-12-15 18:09:07] <%+LzLuke> Elden Ring has driven him to drink?
[2022-12-15 18:09:10] <%Kezzran> @Mykl3 gotcha. I haven't played in probably a year

[2022-12-15 18:18:07] <%thickestboar91> The Leonine Misbegotten is weak to Lightning-based attacks, particularly Incantations, but it's unlikely that you will have unlocked most of these spells this early in Elden Ring. It is also incredibly vulnerable to having its Posture broken, leaving it open for a huge Critical Hit.

[2022-12-15 18:30:19] <%thickestboar91> Before battling Leonine Misbegotten in the tower behind him, we recommend grabbing the whip. It’s a weapon that you can hold in your off-hand, so long as you’re using a one-handed weapon, and you can use it to knock him out of their stance briefly stun him, giving you an opening. You can find it in the dungeon full of rats, next to the Beside the Rampart Gaol, the site of grace. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[2022-12-15 19:06:21] <%Whurleygig> yeah huge bgap between DS3 and this
[2022-12-15 19:06:22] <%poetandersonava> less time than it will take you to complete it
[2022-12-15 19:06:22] <Solid93k> elderin started development in 2016
[2022-12-15 19:06:24] <lowfatcheeze> End of 2016

[2022-12-15 19:06:26] <%+EdgarAllenBroTV> many moons they say
[2022-12-15 19:06:27] <ACADArieS> i honestly think they made the world a bit to big
[2022-12-15 19:06:31] <ACADArieS> like to much dead space
[2022-12-15 19:06:37] <%ZCrimes> they started this work during ds3 dlc content
[2022-12-15 19:06:38] <%MitosisDNB> sold 17.5 million copies
[2022-12-15 19:06:44] <@%OutbreakBot> If you want to support me you can sub for free using Twitch Prime! See if yours is available below. brkGood
[2022-12-15 19:06:47] <%Rukn> I think you're skilled enough to start with the story boss tomorrow
[2022-12-15 19:06:48] <%pistrencejx> and all the mapped region you have now is only like 1/7
[2022-12-15 19:06:52] <%+CharonHendrix> You've barely scratched the surface
[2022-12-15 19:06:57] <%Kezzran> @ACADArieS that's what makes it feel so real
[2022-12-15 19:07:00] <FuriousRexus> Well, the first in a new IP series, will always take longer. THey have a great asset database built from this
[2022-12-15 19:07:03] <%ZCrimes> 1/7th yup

[2022-12-15 19:07:06] <%poetandersonava> this was too much game for me
[2022-12-15 19:07:10] <%ZCrimes> u upgrade textures
[2022-12-15 19:07:12] <%poetandersonava> too much side shit
[2022-12-15 19:07:15] <YeOldeMurloc> graphics are last
[2022-12-15 19:07:17] <%Whurleygig> i thought i was halfway through this game for about 90% of this game
[2022-12-15 19:07:18] <%MitosisDNB> it's their own engine too
[2022-12-15 19:07:21] <%+DLFC> They make super high res models and scale them down
[2022-12-15 19:07:22] <Solid93k> u can always upgrade textures
[2022-12-15 19:07:25] <%LkyJ21> like a remaster throughout the developmnet
[2022-12-15 19:07:27] <%ManSolo> graphics are last generally
[2022-12-15 19:07:28] <%FragmentShader> that's always how it works, ye
[2022-12-15 19:07:28] <Bjorne> placeholder graphics
[2022-12-15 19:07:30] <%+dash_dingo_> you've honestly got so so far to go it's insane
[2022-12-15 19:07:31] <%+Vessec> Depends on the engine used if it's easy to add new features along the way

[2022-12-15 19:08:13] <Sanjo__> you are less then 1/4 through this game.
[2022-12-15 19:08:17] <%ZCrimes> george martin yup
[2022-12-15 19:08:22] <DonerStoom> it's also not a big focus for the team. It's not an ugly game but there's a style to it that lets them get away with not cutting edge graphics
[2022-12-15 19:08:24] <%ZCrimes> yup
[2022-12-15 19:08:26] <%Smorty_1> Yup
[2022-12-15 19:08:28] <%+CharonHendrix> The lore is
[2022-12-15 19:08:44] <nhzc> George average tolkien enjoyer GIGACHAD
[2022-12-15 19:08:46] <Pizzasalad> you find the lore through items
[2022-12-15 19:08:49] <%pistrencejx> so basically you are play "all 6 previous games" in this one.
[2022-12-15 19:08:49] <%ManSolo> I'd say you're less than 1/20th of the way through
[2022-12-15 19:08:52] <Pizzasalad> thats how the souls games are

[2022-12-15 19:08:58] <%ZCrimes> the lore is written by miyazaki, the characters i think by ggrm

[2022-12-15 19:10:32] <%LkyJ21> @ZCrimes exactly my thoughts lore is same across all of them but elden is the most polished of all his souls type games

[2022-12-15 19:11:30] <%ZCrimes> @LkyJ21 this game does incorporate a lot more options and dimensions to potential lore story. it is way grander imo. even if older souls are already grand, its more linear
[2022-12-15 19:11:35] <+dingus_maximus> A lot of the ruins have a boss room in them

[2022-12-15 19:14:10] <%FragmentShader> the map drawings are fairly accurate, it's not just greeble. so if there's a tower or something, you'll actually find something there
