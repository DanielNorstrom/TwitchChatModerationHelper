[2022-12-16 06:14:59] <n0_bo_di> First video fyi
[2022-12-16 06:15:09] <+otf_grim> nah TSM had god spot to farm
[2022-12-16 06:15:16] <+otf_grim> even if they won that fight
[2022-12-16 06:15:17] <ceeis2tall> new team and tsm from a far
[2022-12-16 06:15:24] <ceeis2tall> i dont think they live anyways
[2022-12-16 06:15:25] <%lunabenedict> @otf_grim we gotta pay someone to delete it

[2022-12-16 06:15:35] <%+wolfkingpc> did you watch all the games?
[2022-12-16 06:15:39] [Notification] apearent_gaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! [Hope you're doing well. Sad to hear about the C9 situation]
[2022-12-16 06:15:47] <%skyfallincj> Optics chances of winning Sunday?
[2022-12-16 06:15:54] <bigvick404> how do you feel about faze an tripods going to regionals
[2022-12-16 06:16:12] <niyk88> Does Zach have VODs on so I can watch this later
[2022-12-16 06:16:15] <+mydestiny114> they got a chance but they would have to win it
[2022-12-16 06:16:16] <+MattPorcaro> You going to lan?
[2022-12-16 06:16:18] <44alltheway> can regional finals be explained by someone?  are the current top 9 teams guaranteed for LAN right now or could they lose their spot after this weekend?
[2022-12-16 06:16:32] <%jettyburg> !discord
[2022-12-16 06:16:33] <@^Nightbot> https://discord.gg/H5gnnrz
[2022-12-16 06:16:36] <%ZE6661> @44alltheway, Teams could lose their spot after sunday as they still get points
[2022-12-16 06:16:45] <%+rtshurie1992> @44alltheway Whoever wins the regional finals is in. Automatic bid to LAN. Top 9 AFTER that will be in
[2022-12-16 06:16:49] <+mydestiny114> @44alltheway you must be the first team to get to 50points then u must get 1st place after hitting 50
[2022-12-16 06:16:56] <+otf_grim> i hope some Apex pros that didn’t qual go to LAN to support their friends
[2022-12-16 06:16:58] <%+rtshurie1992> so NA has ten slots
[2022-12-16 06:17:03] <+MattPorcaro> @44alltheway They can lose their spot. The final week is scored like the previous 9 days. But winner gets auto qual
[2022-12-16 06:17:03] <JehadAlsweed90s> @44alltheway they could lose their spots the finals will count the same as regular days
[2022-12-16 06:17:09] <Farabi22> so for, TSM & LIQUID, they are confirm qualify?
[2022-12-16 06:17:10] <%SgtGoatMilk> top 4 right now are the only ones totally safe I think
[2022-12-16 06:17:15] <%+rtshurie1992> @Farabi22 yes
[2022-12-16 06:17:23] <44alltheway> @mydestiny114 I understand the match point system, just not how the top 10 gets affected after it takes place
[2022-12-16 06:17:37] <niyk88> Usually tsm is on that hill
[2022-12-16 06:17:38] <+mydestiny114> @44alltheway it's a normal day of points
[2022-12-16 06:17:56] <the420chef> Since ORN tookover the points that you got with c9, would you have gotten anything if they wound up winning something this split @zachmazer ?
[2022-12-16 06:18:05] <+otf_grim> why is he watching Optic specifically?
[2022-12-16 06:18:11] <+mydestiny114> so placing 4th still gets u like 18 points to the overall leaderboards for example
[2022-12-16 06:18:32] <44alltheway> so lets say NRG, who is in 9th place... finishes 20-15, they could lose their spot?
[2022-12-16 06:18:35] <%SgtGoatMilk> @44alltheway the winner will auto qual, then points will be distributed like a normal algs week, then the top 9 (minus the match point winner) will go to lan
[2022-12-16 06:18:56] <+mydestiny114> depending how high u place on the final day determines how many points u get
[2022-12-16 06:18:59] <44alltheway> @SgtGoatMilk think I got it, thanks for the help!!!
[2022-12-16 06:19:01] <%ZE6661> @44alltheway, There's a chance, yes
[2022-12-16 06:19:03] <+mydestiny114> @44alltheway yes
[2022-12-16 06:19:18] <+mydestiny114> the bottom like 5 teams in top 10 aren't safe
[2022-12-16 06:19:25] <+otf_grim> oh hes gonna watch Optic Faze and TSMs vods…nevermind lol
[2022-12-16 06:19:30] <+mydestiny114> considering other teams are close
[2022-12-16 06:19:42] <%ZE6661> OMEGALUL holy fuck knoqd died so fast
[2022-12-16 06:19:45] <44alltheway> appreciate the help everyone, I do think the regional finals is kinda redundant after 6 weeks of ALGS... why not just choose the top 10 teams after 6 weeks?
[2022-12-16 06:20:06] <+MattPorcaro> There was a duo in there and then tsm came through late
[2022-12-16 06:20:19] <+MattPorcaro> Tsm was suprised duo left the spot.
[2022-12-16 06:20:21] <+mydestiny114> @44alltheway just another week of normal games expect with match point to make it more rng and more exciting for the viewer I guesss
[2022-12-16 06:20:27] <%opheimer> nahhh the vlc player vod review
[2022-12-16 06:20:33] <%opheimer> passion
[2022-12-16 06:20:35] <humpoking> always wipe the edge to close the gap Kreygasm
[2022-12-16 06:20:45] <+otf_grim> @44alltheway i think it’s just to give teams one final chance to redeem themselves for bad games they might’ve had.
[2022-12-16 06:20:45] <n0_bo_di> on he cock I heard
[2022-12-16 06:20:49] <%ZE6661> @44alltheway, To give them a last chance to qualify and create a super stacked and important lobby :9
[2022-12-16 06:20:49] <n0_bo_di> thd
[2022-12-16 06:20:55] <n0_bo_di> fuck the**
[2022-12-16 06:21:09] <+mydestiny114> the match point thing was really only enjoyable to watch with APAC NORTH @44alltheway
[2022-12-16 06:21:15] <+mydestiny114> imo
[2022-12-16 06:21:34] <mugiwarall> That team is TSM
[2022-12-16 06:21:38] <%ZE6661> NOOO doopi
[2022-12-16 06:21:41] <+mydestiny114> and I do like that everyone in Na has. a chance
[2022-12-16 06:21:46] <+otf_grim> do you guys think this years LAN will be the best LAN ever ?
[2022-12-16 06:21:54] <+otf_grim> talent wise
[2022-12-16 06:22:08] <JoeDirt1428> Pretty sure knoqd was 3 2 1d
[2022-12-16 06:22:24] <44alltheway> @otf_grim talent wise, sure, I do wonder if the viewership will be as high as the previous lan though
[2022-12-16 06:22:32] <+mydestiny114> @otf_grim I think it will be similar to last year
[2022-12-16 06:22:57] <44alltheway> isn't LAN supposed to be in London this year?
[2022-12-16 06:22:58] <dankel_weed> is this todays algs day?
[2022-12-16 06:23:13] <+mydestiny114> like a lot these newer teams won't make it in it will the same lan Na wise as last year
[2022-12-16 06:23:14] <+otf_grim> @44alltheway i mean… $5M prize is kind of crazy. i think it’ll be big
[2022-12-16 06:23:33] <tmoxstriker12> once you do get signed please come back with a vengeance bro your so underrated
[2022-12-16 06:23:37] <44alltheway> @otf_grim it kinda depends where it takes place... most viewers are in NA
[2022-12-16 06:23:48] <+mydestiny114> @otf_grim I think APAC NORTH is the fastest growing region talent wise they will dominate imo
[2022-12-16 06:23:57] <%+leeplee2> you doing a watch party Sunday?
[2022-12-16 06:23:57] <%SgtGoatMilk> I do love skittles lower energy comms clashing with his disgusting gameplay lol
[2022-12-16 06:23:58] <ziilp_> the skin in general just looks so bad imo. the way her boots are so chunky just ruins the it imo
[2022-12-16 06:24:04] <+corusal_> @zachmazer are you gonna publish the vod for this? won't be able to catch most of unfortunately :(
[2022-12-16 06:24:07] <+mydestiny114> like APAC NORTH looks dangerous rn
[2022-12-16 06:24:36] <+mydestiny114> there was one team in APAC NORTH with 30kills in one game @otf_grim
[2022-12-16 06:24:40] <%Solembum__> their ass is wide open
[2022-12-16 06:24:48] <imakegreens> im here now you can restart zach

[2022-12-16 06:26:12] <+Oath_Z> skittles doesnt have the intensity to get in on teams bruh
[2022-12-16 06:26:57] <volcan0handz> You wanna coach optic or do they have one?
[2022-12-16 06:26:58] <thiiiny> Why do you think Optic is not doing good this split?
[2022-12-16 06:27:06] <44alltheway> you should see TSM's valk ult this game.. they got god spot for free
[2022-12-16 06:27:27] <ELITE__SURVIVORS> It’s mostly positioning and some team fighting issues
[2022-12-16 06:27:29] <%opheimer> @mydestiny114 that would be cool, i heard he really doesnt like flying though
[2022-12-16 06:27:43] <wierdchammp> @thiiiny doop us a gibby player trying to play seer
[2022-12-16 06:27:43] <%Solembum__> @ELITE__SURVIVORS he'll go through it
[2022-12-16 06:27:46] <wierdchammp> is
[2022-12-16 06:28:23] <44alltheway> idk why they put drop on seer
[2022-12-16 06:28:24] <+mydestiny114> @opheimer tru Lol MAYBE he will sail there 😂
[2022-12-16 06:28:35] <$JstDIFFxrenT> See naughtys laggy fight? Shits so unfair
[2022-12-16 06:29:11] <%opheimer> and skittles eats 3 hits
[2022-12-16 06:29:32] <itspepopog123> They could have made top 20 if he didnt lag here im actually so sad for them https://clips.twitch.tv/VictoriousBoredAlfalfaMau5-cpc3r14r12r3RB7e @zachmazer
[2022-12-16 06:29:33] <%+Yoshii10> bad q by skittles maybe but its hindsight to say that
[2022-12-16 06:30:50] <RAC13L> is this the first time youre doing vod review on stream?
[2022-12-16 06:30:58] <%bigchiefin13> @itspepopog123 dudeeee he almost won that even with the badddd lag
[2022-12-16 06:31:14] <%+blizzyblake> Someone was on roof
[2022-12-16 06:31:20] <+johnsaicic> tsm was roof
[2022-12-16 06:31:37] <%+blizzyblake> I was trying not to say who it was for the future vod review lol
[2022-12-16 06:31:47] <wierdchammp> @bigchiefin13 it was a 2v1 and he almost knocked one of tbe 2
[2022-12-16 06:31:50] <%opheimer> @itspepopog123 they could have got 7th place and 2 more points, would have been same points as FaZe, and then FaZe wins the tie-breaker i think
[2022-12-16 06:31:50] <wierdchammp> the
[2022-12-16 06:32:02] <%opheimer> @itspepopog123 but yeah that dc was tragic
[2022-12-16 06:32:32] <%+blizzyblake> I feel like skittle isnt the same IGL he used to be
[2022-12-16 06:32:59] <RAC13L> Mr mazer teaching us raulda2Octane
[2022-12-16 06:33:05] <%+blizzyblake> Do you have a favorite for Sunday?
[2022-12-16 06:33:06] <44alltheway> skittle is one of the best players in the game
[2022-12-16 06:33:12] <legacy_na101> Wouldnt you want your controller player on valk?
[2022-12-16 06:33:27] <itspepopog123> @zachmazer Rocker took the other building
[2022-12-16 06:33:33] <itspepopog123> next to it
[2022-12-16 06:33:39] <+Uzle_> mack was valk today
[2022-12-16 06:33:44] <%SgtGoatMilk> Still hoping they pull it off sunday, really want these guys to get back to their best
[2022-12-16 06:33:52] <%opheimer> this is the tragic game for naughty
[2022-12-16 06:33:53] <%+joemonty567> @zachmazer ello bruh
[2022-12-16 06:34:11] <%+joemonty567> hi chat
[2022-12-16 06:34:11] <ELITE__SURVIVORS> When it currently comes to 3v3s OpTic is hesitant on fully committing to wipe which screws them over in a lot of scenarios
[2022-12-16 06:34:44] <%bigchiefin13> sen didnt make it PogChamp
[2022-12-16 06:34:50] <Krebgot> can you remove your armour during a crypto ult in ALGS or no?
[2022-12-16 06:34:51] <44alltheway> optic definitely doesn't get as many kills as they used to
[2022-12-16 06:35:27] <44alltheway> @Krebgot yea, teams do it to avoid giving the crypto damage for their armor evo
[2022-12-16 06:35:28] <ELITE__SURVIVORS> I have no idea why they don’t decide to int if they know they have no other choice
[2022-12-16 06:35:31] <%opheimer> furia to their left
[2022-12-16 06:35:53] <wierdchammp> @44alltheway they are used to having gibby for a full reset after fights but they changed comps
[2022-12-16 06:36:14] <peenjesus> Timmmons raid steezu2S
[2022-12-16 06:36:34] <wierdchammp> so they are hesitant because they know they can't get the resets
[2022-12-16 06:36:42] <44alltheway> @wierdchammp LG still runs gibby and I think they are for sure going to lan... would be nice to see optic do the same
[2022-12-16 06:36:51] <%opheimer> pan was solo and shot them in the back
[2022-12-16 06:37:02] <+titan2rox> @zachmazer these vod reviews are A1, appreciate it man

[2022-12-16 06:37:25] <itspepopog123> They could have made top 20 if he didnt lag here im actually so sad for them https://clips.twitch.tv/VictoriousBoredAlfalfaMau5-cpc3r14r12r3RB7e @zachmazer

[2022-12-16 06:42:14] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> @zachmazer what if a team like G2 or OpTic, that has the talent but may not have their macro figured out asked you to coach them?
[2022-12-16 06:42:14] <%+rtshurie1992> been good, not as busy during the holiday season thankfully
[2022-12-16 06:42:15] <Krebgot> wwhat do you think TSM so well to be so consistent ?

[2022-12-16 06:44:17] <pineapple__mango> hi zach!
[2022-12-16 06:44:21] <%opheimer> so sketch playing that with just your smokes
[2022-12-16 06:44:32] <%jol031> you found a team yet zach?
[2022-12-16 06:44:53] <ayehota> the smokes are clutch tho ngl
[2022-12-16 06:45:00] <ayehota> especially when they can't really get full swung
[2022-12-16 06:45:22] <+StolenSnoman> ults gotta go down soon to deter top left from aping
[2022-12-16 06:45:27] <ab_radd> scary time for orgs, man
[2022-12-16 06:45:29] <ayehota> that's why i like smoke it's just great for artificial cover
[2022-12-16 06:45:54] <%jol031> sentinels need a proper igl
[2022-12-16 06:45:58] <+StolenSnoman> ult ult ult
[2022-12-16 06:46:47] <%+GroovyGuy> what about shooting his gun
[2022-12-16 06:46:50] <%+GroovyGuy> PepeLaugh
[2022-12-16 06:46:57] <ok_arturrr> why would they take knoqd off valk
[2022-12-16 06:46:59] <ayehota> yea i think he has to shoot there
[2022-12-16 06:47:10] <+StolenSnoman> getting seer ult down earlier could let them know if they could ape right
[2022-12-16 06:47:12] <+snatchemzz> can we watch them get punched out at the end of this game lol
[2022-12-16 06:47:24] <!Swagheel> hal had no ammo he was punching fences LuL
[2022-12-16 06:47:47] <+Dekharen> Yeah exactly the thing I was thinking. With a correct smoke they could even contest the bridge
[2022-12-16 06:47:51] <+IincompleteI> could t hey not have valk ulted roof? there is only 1 guy on it. or is that too risky?
[2022-12-16 06:47:51] <ayehota> i don't think they knew if they could get up
[2022-12-16 06:48:15] <+Dekharen> Because bridge team can't go up on it without getting shot by TSM or the team on Optic's left
[2022-12-16 06:48:19] <ayehota> i think he should be smoking above them instead of on the ground
[2022-12-16 06:48:48] <%+Yoshii10> its a duo next to them too right? lowkey doop gotta be figuring that out
[2022-12-16 06:48:54] <JoeDirt1428> They should of died there tsm had no ammo lol
[2022-12-16 06:48:57] <ayehota> if he has the smoke floating he can still see if they drop and it's a cleaner fight close range
[2022-12-16 06:49:02] <gasssss11> roof can shoot circuits
[2022-12-16 06:49:06] <stiflerssmom> He even talks like Stifler
[2022-12-16 06:49:09] <JoeDirt1428> In that spot
[2022-12-16 06:49:11] <stiflerssmom> !stifler
[2022-12-16 06:49:11] <@^Nightbot> YES this receding hairline mofucka looks like stiffler from American Pie
[2022-12-16 06:49:16] <+Dekharen> @zachmazer The fact that it's a good play is hindsight but the fact they never checked the upper part in any capacity is a misplay though
[2022-12-16 06:49:18] <%Klobhunter> loving the vod review
[2022-12-16 06:49:26] <+snatchemzz> Mike Tyson for the win lol

[2022-12-16 07:00:04] <%that_pater_boy> i was watching them at this point. they tried to 321 the horizon and mac missed all 5 scout shots
[2022-12-16 07:00:06] <GreasedOn> They’re better off just hard committing here.

[2022-12-16 07:01:09] <GreasedOn> Right. Just commit to this. Trust your edge comp and fight. You can’t just panic and slide down. You’ve made noise and other teams are going to be looking to gatekeep now.
[2022-12-16 07:01:12] <peifitup> Off topic, I feel personally victimized that you took 200 rp off of me yesterday in ranked

[2022-12-16 07:02:41] <%+Yoshii10> didnt even crack her lmfao
[2022-12-16 07:02:41] <%lunabenedict> i think mac barely got there
[2022-12-16 07:02:45] <ChronoCreative> The aim was not crispy today
[2022-12-16 07:02:49] <%+blizzyblake> Mac missed all his shots
[2022-12-16 07:02:49] <%that_pater_boy> no. maf went 0 for 5
[2022-12-16 07:02:51] <snowolfyNUS2026> mac missed all
[2022-12-16 07:02:54] <%+Yoshii10> cause you dont see the crack on the top right
[2022-12-16 07:03:04] <JoeDirt1428> No crack in kill feed right
[2022-12-16 07:03:08] <snowolfyNUS2026> i remember waching the vod
[2022-12-16 07:03:11] <snowolfyNUS2026> no hits from mac
[2022-12-16 07:03:15] <JoeDirt1428> Yea what @yoshii10 said
[2022-12-16 07:03:45] <snowolfyNUS2026> whats the format your doing for this review?
[2022-12-16 07:03:55] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> no he didn't
[2022-12-16 07:04:00] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> Horizon wasn't craced
[2022-12-16 07:04:01] <gabitobotaba> ALGS Moment was Hal saying to Reps. "Q him baby" man that was funny af
[2022-12-16 07:04:06] <GreasedOn> Is this VOD staying up? Gotta sleep but wanna watch in the AM.
[2022-12-16 07:04:20] <%that_pater_boy> Zach i was litterally in macs stream. mac went 0 for 5
[2022-12-16 07:04:25] <snowolfyNUS2026> he litterally said no crack in the feed
[2022-12-16 07:05:02] <agiliteyFPS> 1 mnk player in top 10 kills thoughts @zachmazer?
[2022-12-16 07:05:57] <%ShineVAL> @agiliteyfps controller will always be consistent damage especially in mid close range fights
[2022-12-16 07:06:11] <%ShineVAL> expected tbh
[2022-12-16 07:06:38] <agiliteyFPS> 100% just kinda sad
[2022-12-16 07:06:56] <snowolfyNUS2026> not sad
[2022-12-16 07:07:08] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> Spray weapons are too strong right now, controllers are eating well
[2022-12-16 07:07:08] <snowolfyNUS2026> you play controller for kills
[2022-12-16 07:07:20] <%pray4jeremy> Thoughts are theres just way more rollers in NA than anywhere else
[2022-12-16 07:07:31] <snowolfyNUS2026> when shotguns become meta then mnk will become more prevelant again
[2022-12-16 07:07:49] <%pray4jeremy> EMEA had like 10 rollers max in top 25 kills
[2022-12-16 07:08:31] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> TylerFPS just destroys the lobby every week though, AA is definitely kinda broken
[2022-12-16 07:08:45] <agiliteyFPS> tyler smurfing in algs
[2022-12-16 07:08:56] <ChronoCreative> We aren't playing bang going forward
[2022-12-16 07:09:52] <+Lockeht> that ult benefits the other team more then faze
[2022-12-16 07:09:58] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> This fight was sooo bad lmao
[2022-12-16 07:09:58] <%$Playyd> mac should be on horizon and slurp on bang no
[2022-12-16 07:10:06] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> I think they cracked one Furia player

[2022-12-16 07:12:28] <epictaco_> This game makes me think this team has no hope unless they make very major changes
[2022-12-16 07:12:34] <+marzisrippin> So many valk ults got exploded this game LUL
[2022-12-16 07:13:01] <@%claraatwork> LUL
[2022-12-16 07:13:01] <%+aiymless> do you ever think Mac doesn't go for the simplest play enough?
[2022-12-16 07:13:04] <%+lanerz> its electric so punch would suck
[2022-12-16 07:13:08] <@%claraatwork> this part is SOOO good
[2022-12-16 07:13:08] <+titan2rox> Take note of the wall lol

[2022-12-16 07:15:38] <book503> snipe popping ult and sliding down from the hill was the beginning of the end
[2022-12-16 07:16:03] <+CHAL1400> they say don’t play bottom epi then all sit in bottom epi
[2022-12-16 07:17:07] <%KJCastleberry> That is Furia on top of the hill
[2022-12-16 07:17:07] <%+brutalbrah_> this zone end was crazy
[2022-12-16 07:17:16] <+onthewaterr> Mac should stick to igling, he would have gotten better. snipe does not talk enough

[2022-12-16 07:23:07] <+StolenSnoman> if it wasnt a new castle team, they woulda wiped it. unfortunate
[2022-12-16 07:23:08] <book503> i could tell mac was trying his hardest to be open minded to snipes ideas but sometimes snipe pushes it with all due respect
[2022-12-16 07:23:12] <jaycogs> snipe didn't comm the proper information he had
[2022-12-16 07:23:17] <+mydestiny114> this a new team, they gota keep the reps going theyll get it
[2022-12-16 07:23:19] <%+VVS_Darkness> Why didn’t snipe punch it? Doesn’t punching the wall do more damage?
[2022-12-16 07:23:26] <%+tbailes> Snipes play but mac takes it over really quick ]
[2022-12-16 07:23:43] <chad_papi> If they stayed on bridge they would have had an isolated fight with furia too
[2022-12-16 07:23:44] <%that_pater_boy> mac just stood and stared at the wall for 2 whole sec
[2022-12-16 07:23:53] <GreasedOn> Will you be keeping this vod so I can finish watching in the AM..??
[2022-12-16 07:24:21] <+ReaperJF> if it was slurp they wouldn't sucked? or nah?
[2022-12-16 07:24:30] <%axmanmuscle> mac loses health because he takes the scenic route

[2022-12-16 07:31:33] <%ShineVAL> I miss Lou, never watched algs sen but his stream w those guys looked so fun
[2022-12-16 07:31:38] <forkkeester> faze can come away with good lessons but I question how much really carries over into the next week
[2022-12-16 07:31:49] <%Eggstrovert> recycled tsm worse than actual tsm who woulda thunk
[2022-12-16 07:31:52] <book503> right

[2022-12-16 07:31:55] <YSLExplicit> he saw the newcastle q after he got to slurps side

[2022-12-16 07:32:11] <+Wildfire7V> would you and lou team again?
[2022-12-16 07:32:17] <fortunqq> I think what faze needs is a coach
[2022-12-16 07:32:28] <%Eggstrovert> faze needs a new IGL
[2022-12-16 07:32:31] <%Eggstrovert> i dont think alb is it
[2022-12-16 07:32:31] <YSLExplicit> they have one
[2022-12-16 07:32:38] <%that_pater_boy> mac did rightfully apologize at the start of this game
[2022-12-16 07:32:38] <forkkeester> they muted stream for a few minutes and got it out I think
[2022-12-16 07:32:39] <%The_Real_Slyte> faze does have chrono
[2022-12-16 07:32:51] <JoeDirt1428> @mydestiny114 2.5 about

[2022-12-16 07:33:03] <+mydestiny114> @JoeDirt1428 3 of them would kill it fast then

[2022-12-16 07:34:31] <+StolenSnoman> alb was super indecisive before this, wasted so much meds having the boys run in the open for no reason

[2022-12-16 07:35:25] <Expadable> @The_Real_Slyte coach for SEN. they still look for new player
[2022-12-16 07:35:39] <YSLExplicit> the last time i saw alb in that spot he hit 4 nasty kraber shots and c9 killed NRG
[2022-12-16 07:35:53] <%The_Real_Slyte> @expadable but he has been playing for them for the last few weeks and they just got relegated today
[2022-12-16 07:35:56] <jay_jay1888> loving the content Zach, keep up the work m8.
[2022-12-16 07:35:58] <JoeDirt1428> @mydestiny114 I think they are 10-15 range. They are still adjusting to NA lobbies being different for aure
[2022-12-16 07:36:04] <fortunqq> @expadable pretty sure nocturnal is going to sen

[2022-12-16 07:36:46] <+KianiKardi> Isk guys i think Alb sucks
[2022-12-16 07:36:56] <MercilesShark> SEN will be playing with a roller tmrw in oversight
[2022-12-16 07:36:59] <+mydestiny114> furia seems to be the best at bangalore in na, but truthfully APAC north is way better at bangalore than NA
[2022-12-16 07:37:05] <MercilesShark> @fortunqq it was a troll
[2022-12-16 07:37:06] <%KJCastleberry> You cant see it, but there was a rat in the bridge pretty sure I saw on map zone
[2022-12-16 07:37:07] <forkkeester> optic was in there too somewhere

[2022-12-16 07:37:58] <%KJCastleberry> But i could be faded
[2022-12-16 07:38:00] <!%Tbills04> mac for sure overthinks he needs to simplify a lot of his ideas
[2022-12-16 07:38:01] <%that_pater_boy> Zach if you were offered a coaching position on a t1 org would you take a long think about accepting it?
[2022-12-16 07:38:07] <+mydestiny114> @JoeDirt1428 not in it? U mean they not in same region

[2022-12-16 07:38:47] <GreasedOn> @kjcastleberry there was. Don’t remember who but they were playing the rocks on the right side of the bridge.

[2022-12-16 07:38:58] <%KJCastleberry> @GreasedOn Might have been Sung

[2022-12-16 07:46:03] <shazo13> He shot at 3 not 1 lol
[2022-12-16 07:46:05] <Lewda> we were horizon lol
[2022-12-16 07:46:06] <tropicaldandy777> no shot
[2022-12-16 07:46:08] <tripsrt> faze said its hs alt replay
[2022-12-16 07:46:09] <%crossfirex17> macs bang ults are something else
[2022-12-16 07:46:12] <%KJCastleberry> That was Macs
[2022-12-16 07:46:14] <ok_arturrr> mac cant igl and his ego is too big to listen
[2022-12-16 07:46:19] <%The_Real_Slyte> mac has really been fuckin up his bang ults
[2022-12-16 07:46:31] <tropicaldandy777> literally fucks them KEKW
[2022-12-16 07:46:33] <book503> you cant chuck bang ults 100 meters
[2022-12-16 07:46:39] <book503> you could only throw it so far lol
[2022-12-16 07:46:52] <GreasedOn> @book503 you can chuck it farther than that 😂
[2022-12-16 07:47:07] <%th3illusion> Mac mazer moment
[2022-12-16 07:47:13] <mach880> @lewda u guys played so well today,good luck on Sunday
[2022-12-16 07:47:14] <fortunqq> Fazer moment
[2022-12-16 07:47:20] <+Litnetti> really like this content @zachmazer, you gonna keep the vod up?
[2022-12-16 07:47:20] <%th3illusion> lol fazerr
[2022-12-16 07:47:23] <book503> @GreasedOn i agree but hes been making the point that all of his ults were bad
[2022-12-16 07:47:26] <GreasedOn> I like the guy who said Fazer Moment that’s a god tier term honestly
[2022-12-16 07:47:30] <Lewda> i just dont understand why they committed that hard when they know were getting shot in the back
[2022-12-16 07:47:31] <chad_papi> Think he threw it to prevent the push after the horizon ult
[2022-12-16 07:47:36] <%Halfblackops> nope OMEGALUL
[2022-12-16 07:47:36] <tropicaldandy777> NO WAY

[2022-12-16 07:47:49] <GreasedOn> @book503 cause they were lmao. They all were too short.
[2022-12-16 07:47:55] <+Mexicoko> allScoob allScoob allScoob allScoob
[2022-12-16 07:47:55] <Expadable> goddamn
[2022-12-16 07:47:55] <tripsrt> it vouldve been a bit better
[2022-12-16 07:48:08] <chad_papi> LOL
[2022-12-16 07:48:17] <YSLExplicit> the next game tho u can tell theyre actually locked in
[2022-12-16 07:48:17] <tofo> the smoke in the seer ult wasn't that great
[2022-12-16 07:48:19] <%The_Real_Slyte> i feel like they need to use this comp and play ranked with no coms for a week
[2022-12-16 07:48:28] <book503> @GreasedOn yeah let him run in the open with bang ult in hand to make it reach 10 m further with the risk of getting melted
[2022-12-16 07:48:32] <fortunqq> Sniped ego chall to 2 people
[2022-12-16 07:48:34] <%+witz_krackerz> like 3 times he bang ulted their own push 😂😂
[2022-12-16 07:48:34] <Lewda> they literally had a free walk up the hill they didnt need to fight us
[2022-12-16 07:48:36] <Expadable> the Hal experience
[2022-12-16 07:48:37] <!slurpeeg_> he ususlly does express it
[2022-12-16 07:48:38] <%smokinglucky> snipe only handles it better now cause he's over 30
[2022-12-16 07:48:38] <GreasedOn> That’s like 15 years of esports doom and gloom built up in old man snipe
[2022-12-16 07:48:42] <%th3illusion> snipe and hall barked it out on a storm point game
[2022-12-16 07:48:43] <!slurpeeg_> he just didnt today
[2022-12-16 07:48:55] <%th3illusion> mac*
[2022-12-16 07:49:00] <forkkeester> been sick probably didn't have the energy
[2022-12-16 07:49:01] <%SlyPigsFly> that comes with age...
[2022-12-16 07:49:03] <Itztunnelsteamy> hes been playing forever
[2022-12-16 07:49:11] <%+blizzyblake> He is a grown ass man lol
[2022-12-16 07:49:13] <juh079> Cause snip3 is a vet bro, a legend of the game
[2022-12-16 07:49:13] <book503> the trade off of getting the ult 5-10 meters further and getting melted isnt worth it imo
[2022-12-16 07:49:20] <%KJCastleberry> Ive heard him express it more than once LUL
[2022-12-16 07:49:23] <Dyllionaire> I dont understand why they would play bang with snipe on roller
[2022-12-16 07:49:28] <Itztunnelsteamy> got used to it from halo
[2022-12-16 07:49:29] <%+blizzyblake> Slurp baby I see it coming Sunday, manifest it
[2022-12-16 07:49:33] <%crossfirex17> when hes won a zillion championships in halo lol. know how to handle some tough stuff
[2022-12-16 07:49:37] <epictaco_> @book503 Did you even watch that ult tho?
[2022-12-16 07:49:45] <GreasedOn> Man I kinda miss watching Snipe unload on Hal tho. That shit was prime Reddit content
[2022-12-16 07:49:45] <+jakechillenhall> @book503 he couldve thrown it farther from right where he was at lmao
[2022-12-16 07:49:48] <prettyboy2103> So what happens to the bottom 8 teams?
[2022-12-16 07:49:51] <book503> @epictaco_ yeah ia gree that ult was bad but im saying the others werent really

[2022-12-16 07:50:20] <JoeDirt1428> @book503 dude I love alb but he literally just thre that at his feet go in firing range and see how far it goes when you look up at a forty five degree angle and jump tell me it doesn’t go farther lmao and I’m an octane seer main and I know that
[2022-12-16 07:50:26] <%th3illusion> Albs view had horizon in middle
[2022-12-16 07:50:28] <forkkeester> yeah she gets to cover in half a second
[2022-12-16 07:50:50] <book503> chat i agree this ult was horrible. the other ones he was at risk of getting beamed look at his vod
[2022-12-16 07:51:01] <YSLExplicit> and now for the best game of the day

[2022-12-16 07:51:39] <GreasedOn> @book503 one of them on worlds edge the team was literally running away from them. No risk of getting beamed there but still came up short lol
[2022-12-16 07:51:45] <book503> with all due respect sometimes i dont understand snipe
[2022-12-16 07:51:55] <%th3illusion> Snipe also aped when Slurp and Alb couldnt follow quick enought
[2022-12-16 07:51:57] <book503> @GreasedOn good point
[2022-12-16 07:51:58] <!slurpeeg_> i couldnt see the horizon on my angle
[2022-12-16 07:51:59] <DrRisto> @book503 facts bro lmaoo

[2022-12-16 07:52:38] <book503> bruh LMAO
[2022-12-16 07:52:39] <ryouuh> KEKW
[2022-12-16 07:52:46] <+mydestiny114> @tripsrt faze has great team chem they just dont play together
[2022-12-16 07:52:46] <book503> this audio
[2022-12-16 07:52:51] <isn1pezl> ab was first ??
[2022-12-16 07:52:57] <%crossfirex17> this is insane.
[2022-12-16 07:53:00] <+mydestiny114> or rather they arent onthe same page
[2022-12-16 07:53:00] <%th3illusion> thats just bad luck tbh
[2022-12-16 07:53:17] <fortunqq> Alb was last to ping
[2022-12-16 07:53:21] <kabeee710> 38 dmg
[2022-12-16 07:53:21] <+mydestiny114> if faze gets on "the same page" they are dangerous
[2022-12-16 07:53:22] <kabeee710> lol
[2022-12-16 07:53:24] <Expadable> @th3illusion no teamwork
[2022-12-16 07:53:26] <tofo> theres a clip where tsm does the opposite and takes to long to react
[2022-12-16 07:53:26] <pineapple__mango> lol
[2022-12-16 07:53:26] <isn1pezl> ab was first
[2022-12-16 07:53:36] <mashrash> who watched the opposite happen in hilarious fashion for Hal and Evan on the Watson?
[2022-12-16 07:53:59] <%SgtGoatMilk> The clip of hal and evan trying to 321 and then evan walks through a fence was comedy
[2022-12-16 07:54:05] <+osakana_suki> so basically 70% of thier problems are communications?
[2022-12-16 07:54:06] <+goosee15> That bang alt lololololl
[2022-12-16 07:54:06] <tripsrt> @mydestiny114 idk if you watched any of the algs matchdays but their best day was 2nd place respectfully and they are sitting at 20th place almost being elimed..
[2022-12-16 07:54:09] <book503> let's remember this is their first ALGS together guys
[2022-12-16 07:54:10] <%th3illusion> they still could have salvaged that with a good bang ult like zach said - though enemy team had horizon and caphra
[2022-12-16 07:54:20] <xjayEra> from watching faze i think max moves way to quick without verbalizing what he wants to do but expects slurp and snipe to know. idk
[2022-12-16 07:54:25] <fortunqq> @boo
[2022-12-16 07:54:34] <chad_papi> They’re getting gaslighted lol
[2022-12-16 07:54:37] <%smokinglucky> new igl on the horizon?
[2022-12-16 07:54:43] <avemane> LUL LUL
[2022-12-16 07:54:46] <!slurpeeg_> i was losin my mind
[2022-12-16 07:54:47] <n0_bo_di> Alb is so dumb
[2022-12-16 07:54:49] <chad_papi> Unintentionally
[2022-12-16 07:54:49] <ok_arturrr> mac refuses to listen 💀
[2022-12-16 07:54:58] <n0_bo_di> dude don't listen
[2022-12-16 07:54:59] <forkkeester> lord lmao
[2022-12-16 07:55:00] <%th3illusion> Alb is not dumb
[2022-12-16 07:55:07] <RoyalTwist> faze in a good state
[2022-12-16 07:55:16] <legacy_na101> Mac hurts this team more than helps
[2022-12-16 07:55:16] <+CHAL1400> I’ve been so sad the past weeks as a mac fan
[2022-12-16 07:55:19] <kabeee710> ego is gettin the way of the DUB
[2022-12-16 07:55:20] <+gonzo34> I think he does ping first tho lol he pinged twice
[2022-12-16 07:55:21] <book503> mac tried his hardest to be open minded to snipes ideas but i feel like it messes him up sometimes
[2022-12-16 07:55:22] <Lewda> the biggest problem was best case scenario they get 3 extra points
[2022-12-16 07:55:25] <n0_bo_di> he never makes any mistakes, hes "perfect"
[2022-12-16 07:55:32] <fortunqq> No wonder mac isnt signed yet mandeChrist
[2022-12-16 07:55:33] <isn1pezl> if you look Alb was first when they first peak the corner?? RIght??
[2022-12-16 07:55:35] <MrShipton> its tough dealing with someone who refuses to acknowledge their own mistakes
[2022-12-16 07:55:48] <book503> @fortunqq he's literally been on TSM since day 1
[2022-12-16 07:55:50] <tropicaldandy777> @fortunqq he's in tsm bro
[2022-12-16 07:55:54] <theyre_one_shot> they shot too fast, couldnt communicate who could see who
[2022-12-16 07:56:00] <isn1pezl> ahhhh ok I see
[2022-12-16 07:56:09] <MrShipton> ok to make them. but if you dont realize it then there is no hope
[2022-12-16 07:56:11] <fortunqq> I mean to faze
[2022-12-16 07:56:13] <+gonzo34> i see now damn feels bad man
[2022-12-16 07:56:15] <+gonzo34> lol
[2022-12-16 07:56:16] <%th3illusion> Mac thought they still had his initial ping in view
[2022-12-16 07:56:20] <%th3illusion> go easy
[2022-12-16 07:56:38] <+zhypanova> faith ASMR BOOBA
[2022-12-16 07:56:40] <aayyeyye> he also counted down so fast
[2022-12-16 07:56:47] <tropicaldandy777> @fortunqq he probably gets paid more on tsm
[2022-12-16 07:56:47] <stiflerssmom> LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-16 07:56:52] <PrettyBoySwagPro> Esa got griefed by how long this took lol
[2022-12-16 07:56:56] <book503> @fortunqq he wanted to stay signed to TSM
[2022-12-16 07:56:57] <!slurpeeg_> i wish i could see the horizon in the open field lolll
[2022-12-16 07:56:58] <aayyeyye> he said right here 321 go all within a second
[2022-12-16 07:57:06] <fortunqq> @tropicaldandy777 maybe
[2022-12-16 07:57:21] <+Chainshada> Lag screwing with the countdown too? Snipe's stream has Alb shooting 1st, Albs has Slurp shooting on 3
[2022-12-16 07:57:21] <JKAPfookin> Slurp pinged left too
[2022-12-16 07:57:23] <legacy_na101> bang ult is the cherry on top
[2022-12-16 07:57:24] <%Tlewis77> seeing the bang alt kills me
[2022-12-16 07:57:25] <kabeee710> @slurpeeg_ bruh lol
[2022-12-16 07:57:32] <n0_bo_di> Slurp show this shit to alb maybe he learns something
[2022-12-16 07:57:41] <tripsrt> atleast he destroyed the horizon alt
[2022-12-16 07:57:58] <book503> @n0_bo_di i feel like this is someones burner
[2022-12-16 07:58:06] <pirate6i9> @slurpeeg_ ggs on that last one
[2022-12-16 07:58:12] <costarica69> whos the igl for optic
[2022-12-16 07:58:17] <+Mexicoko> they need to look at the one the point man is calling out allKermit
[2022-12-16 07:58:18] <GreasedOn> Y’all it’s an ult not an alt lmao
[2022-12-16 07:58:24] <Farabi22> simple. faze needs time to gel

[2022-12-16 07:59:24] <pirate6i9> just needs to be more calm maybe
[2022-12-16 07:59:26] <chef_blake11> snipe threw on his shots
[2022-12-16 07:59:46] <+KianiKardi> @fortunqq stop saying he’s gaslighting, he’s not
[2022-12-16 07:59:48] <tripsrt> they also lash out at each other
[2022-12-16 07:59:55] <Farabi22> snipe is just too old.
[2022-12-16 08:00:04] <+mydestiny114> 30 is not too old
[2022-12-16 08:00:05] <book503> it happens no ones perfect

[2022-12-16 08:00:16] <+KianiKardi> @farabi22 snipes old? But will run ur pockets in the range relax
[2022-12-16 08:00:18] <fortunqq> @kianikardi mac is saying slurp can see horizon when he is not. How is that not gaslighting
[2022-12-16 08:00:18] <wierdchammp> @tripsrt they all played and felt like shit
[2022-12-16 08:00:24] <+StolenSnoman> The common denominator is that none of them hit their shot regardless of who they shoot at
[2022-12-16 08:00:24] <YSLExplicit> @tripsrt unfortunately in competitive things its not all sunshine and rainbows.. maybe try fortnite
[2022-12-16 08:00:24] <JoeDirt1428> @fortunqq not 5050 anymore
[2022-12-16 08:00:25] <pirate6i9> imagine thinking 30 is old in gaming
[2022-12-16 08:00:30] <+TR1BE2> snipe is no way too old
[2022-12-16 08:00:30] <%+ultravioletpixie> they hadn't been targeted yet so he had the 5 or seconds to make sure they were all on the same target
[2022-12-16 08:00:41] <pirate6i9> steph can shot jumpers til he is 85 years old
[2022-12-16 08:00:43] <+mydestiny114> snipe is yung
[2022-12-16 08:00:46] <+zhypanova> 30 is ancient
[2022-12-16 08:00:47] <+jmoneysniper2> idk why mac still hasn't looked at slurpes vod already
[2022-12-16 08:00:53] <fortunqq> @joedirt1428 i see
[2022-12-16 08:00:54] <tofo> they played it too fast
[2022-12-16 08:00:55] <+BigBallerBreezy> Snipe has been through this, he's trying to keep the team level headed still and not full tilt. Mac couldn't let it go regardless of what the bad play is
[2022-12-16 08:00:58] <%+swaggypdota> isn't mac older
[2022-12-16 08:01:01] <chad_papi> @fortunqq gaslighting probably the wrong word, more like Alb just speaks out of his ass bc he wants to be right
[2022-12-16 08:01:03] <+jmoneysniper2> any dispute should instantly be handled by lookin at the vods
[2022-12-16 08:01:03] <forkkeester> slurp didn't stream @jmoneysniper2
[2022-12-16 08:01:04] <bakeshield> snipe has the most kills on this team and chat thinking he's too old lol
[2022-12-16 08:01:06] <mashrash> i don't get it, why aren't we talking about the overall macro there leading to max 3 kills even if they did kill ESA? is that not the real issue?
[2022-12-16 08:01:08] <wierdchammp> @swaggypdota no
[2022-12-16 08:01:15] <%Tlewis77> Seems to me like faze really wanted to due better but they are still in it so they can go big next split right
[2022-12-16 08:01:16] <pirate6i9> lol
[2022-12-16 08:01:20] <n0_bo_di> @jmoneysniper2 too much pride to see it and accept his mistakes
[2022-12-16 08:01:21] <chad_papi> Don’t think he means to be malicious with it at all
[2022-12-16 08:01:22] <%+swaggypdota> solid emp
[2022-12-16 08:01:38] <fortunqq> @chad_papi noted
[2022-12-16 08:01:38] <%+lowenergy69> you missed top 20 by 2 @zachmazer so sad
[2022-12-16 08:01:46] <wierdchammp> @mashrash after the end mac  blamed his macro
[2022-12-16 08:01:50] <+jmoneysniper2> @n0_bo_di idk maybe just didn't even think to do it i just think that's the best way to resolve problems
[2022-12-16 08:02:03] <+jmoneysniper2> the truth is right in the vod
[2022-12-16 08:02:05] <+TR1BE2> snipe is a legend ...  he is seeing all sides
[2022-12-16 08:02:06] <ok_arturrr> SHUT THE FUCK UP WATCH MY VOD
[2022-12-16 08:02:08] <+mydestiny114> tired of gaming chairs ads lol give me somthing else

[2022-12-16 08:02:31] <dankel_weed> hal always does immediate vod review if he can its so funny he'll yell at evan then instantly open his stream
[2022-12-16 08:02:32] <tripsrt> @YSLExplicit there is a difference between disagreements and toxicity
[2022-12-16 08:02:32] <YSLExplicit> chrono is here
[2022-12-16 08:02:34] <fortunqq> But mac bang’s ult is horrible tho and that might cost them the game

[2022-12-16 08:03:25] <wierdchammp> @zhypanova he admitts his fault all the time but when he thinks he is right he believes it
[2022-12-16 08:03:38] <+jmoneysniper2> imperialImperialSmile
[2022-12-16 08:03:41] <book503> this is why everyone on the team needs to stream or record their vods
[2022-12-16 08:03:44] <YSLExplicit> if youd ever participated in something of this magnitude and threw youd be doing the same thing
[2022-12-16 08:03:44] <book503> its so important
[2022-12-16 08:03:50] <YSLExplicit> relax
[2022-12-16 08:03:55] <plycaeus> slurp doesn’t have the specs to run stream while they play tourneys @zachmazer
[2022-12-16 08:03:55] <pirate6i9> small miscommunication

[2022-12-16 08:04:52] <wierdchammp> @n0_bo_di he admits right after the tourney his macros were shit
[2022-12-16 08:04:53] <pirate6i9> they bangered that last game. clutched tf up
[2022-12-16 08:05:06] <YSLExplicit> @tripsrt who r u
[2022-12-16 08:05:07] <%lunabenedict> watching this last game was a relief
[2022-12-16 08:05:33] <+ljhergan> alb did
[2022-12-16 08:05:37] <fortunqq> Atleast faze still play finals
[2022-12-16 08:05:43] <%Eggstrovert> Hal please post nude calendar in theme of a lan win :))
[2022-12-16 08:05:48] <+zhypanova> what does the touching mean
[2022-12-16 08:05:55] <JoeDirt1428> @jmoneysniper2 hindsight we was had a legitimate chance
[2022-12-16 08:05:58] <wierdchammp> FaZe def shouldn't have been in pro league
[2022-12-16 08:06:12] <JoeDirt1428> Esa*
[2022-12-16 08:06:15] <n0_bo_di> @wierdchammp bro, that's literally nothing, they have to watch VODS and accept mistakes, Alb does not, calling "macro" mistakes at the end ofhe tourney does not help
[2022-12-16 08:06:15] <pirate6i9> down bad
[2022-12-16 08:06:16] <+mydestiny114> u down bad egg

[2022-12-16 08:06:46] <+KianiKardi> Snipe needs to full control IGL
[2022-12-16 08:06:48] <book503> @wierdchammp huge mac fan here, i agree. sometimes you need time to get chemistry and gel
[2022-12-16 08:06:59] <book503> @KianiKardi yikes
[2022-12-16 08:07:05] <SaucyHarambe69> only guard today
[2022-12-16 08:07:10] <%lunabenedict> guard was here, tl was not
[2022-12-16 08:07:13] <wierdchammp> @n0_bo_di they talk after stream and so vid reviews
[2022-12-16 08:07:19] <%Eggstrovert> alb imo is not IGL material.
[2022-12-16 08:07:24] <wierdchammp> they don't just talk on steam
[2022-12-16 08:07:29] <wierdchammp> stream
[2022-12-16 08:07:33] <%lunabenedict> egg i think your judgment is clouded
[2022-12-16 08:07:43] <YSLExplicit> @Eggstrovert thanks u must be a pro!
[2022-12-16 08:07:44] <chad_papi> @eggstrovert he’s boyfriend material
[2022-12-16 08:07:45] <+KianiKardi> @eggstrovert facts all i see is alb getting his team killed by bad plays or aggro plays that go wrong
[2022-12-16 08:07:45] <JoeDirt1428> @jmoneysniper2 you talking about overall are this match day we all know they won today that’s why your comment is hindsight act like I’m not a tsm fan lol you even own a jersey?
[2022-12-16 08:07:49] <pirate6i9> lemme find out you pretty smart
[2022-12-16 08:07:49] <+mydestiny114> egg alb has an igl mind, he just needs practice
[2022-12-16 08:07:50] <+KianiKardi> And its been for years now
[2022-12-16 08:07:54] <book503> @Eggstrovert its his first time full IGL relax

[2022-12-16 08:08:11] <fortunqq> They should all kiss and make up
[2022-12-16 08:08:17] <+mydestiny114> alb has a great mind for the game, being a good igl isnt automatic
[2022-12-16 08:08:24] <wierdchammp> @fortunqq they will
[2022-12-16 08:08:24] <book503> @mydestiny114 exactly
[2022-12-16 08:08:25] <+mydestiny114> u have to learn to call and play
[2022-12-16 08:08:28] <%smokinglucky> this shit is entertaining

[2022-12-16 08:08:57] <+mydestiny114> @book503 its hard to call and play your best at same time hal has said heed be a fragger if not igl
[2022-12-16 08:08:59] <book503> getting thrown into pro league a week after being formed doesnt help. nevertheless no one would turn down that opportunity
[2022-12-16 08:09:00] <tripsrt> @KianiKardi he did ggod when hal igled him
[2022-12-16 08:09:12] <%Eggstrovert> cracked fragger sure. Does he know what to do in most situations, maybe. He doesn't really know how to lead a team though because his comms have never been super clear.l.
[2022-12-16 08:09:21] <wierdchammp> @kianikardi TL was nocturnal C9 was coigl
[2022-12-16 08:09:31] <tripsrt> @Eggstrovert 100%
[2022-12-16 08:09:32] <%Eggstrovert> also his mental is pretty bad no contest.

[2022-12-16 08:09:34] <+mydestiny114> @Eggstrovert ur descibing someone who needs more practice leading

[2022-12-16 08:09:37] <chad_papi> I don’t say this to be mean but FaZe is like a discount Vexed. If faze gets their calls right they could farm lobbies like vexed.

[2022-12-16 08:09:45] <%Halfblackops> Looney tunes shit on that door
[2022-12-16 08:09:49] <+zhypanova> @mydestiny114 but thats the point, hes not that great of an IGL
[2022-12-16 08:09:49] <SaucyHarambe69> that was tsm valk ult from wall into the right building
[2022-12-16 08:09:51] <%The_Real_Slyte> snipe just screwed himself right there LUL
[2022-12-16 08:09:52] <pirate6i9> everyone says Mac is one of the top mechanical players in the game. maybe trying to do to much. it's tough all around tho
[2022-12-16 08:09:58] <fortunqq> Snipe is man handling the door
[2022-12-16 08:10:02] <+StolenSnoman> The door was awkward.
[2022-12-16 08:10:06] <+mydestiny114> @zhypanova not yet but he has the strategical mind for it
[2022-12-16 08:10:17] <%th3illusion> also tries to fight when slurp is low..
[2022-12-16 08:10:17] <JoeDirt1428> @jmoneysniper2 badass78Sus
[2022-12-16 08:10:18] <gucciflipflopper> its kinda hard to expect 3 in there to seer ult beforehand though
[2022-12-16 08:10:21] <gucciflipflopper> kinda hindsight
[2022-12-16 08:10:25] <tripsrt> @mydestiny114 he is a smart guy
[2022-12-16 08:10:25] <%Tlewis77> I like that snipe says I did a ton of damage he just goes I did a little damage
[2022-12-16 08:10:29] <book503> @pirate6i9 they need a coach. too much of a load for someones whos first time being IGL
[2022-12-16 08:10:32] <bakeshield> That was tsm
[2022-12-16 08:10:39] <tropicaldandy777> ton of damage Kappa
[2022-12-16 08:10:40] <+mydestiny114> @zhypanova hees the closest to being a viable igl on the team
[2022-12-16 08:10:41] <+zhypanova> @mydestiny114 I personally don't have faith in him. Doesn't mean that  it won'
[2022-12-16 08:10:41] <%Eggstrovert> didn't Mac IGL liquid?
[2022-12-16 08:10:45] <+zhypanova> won't happen*
[2022-12-16 08:10:48] <%Eggstrovert> didn't Zach let him coigl?
[2022-12-16 08:10:48] <chad_papi> Or heartbeat scanning as you come up
[2022-12-16 08:10:49] <pirate6i9> @book503 they have one
[2022-12-16 08:10:51] <wierdchammp> @eggstrovert no
[2022-12-16 08:10:53] <chad_papi> So you’re not surprised
[2022-12-16 08:10:55] <zRaided_> Snipe needs to drop the shotguns bro has aimbot in his hands needs to run smgs
[2022-12-16 08:11:02] <book503> @pirate6i9 he's an analyst apparently not a coach
[2022-12-16 08:11:11] <+mydestiny114> wat was that noice
[2022-12-16 08:11:11] <%th3illusion> they needed this game soo bad
[2022-12-16 08:11:12] <+mydestiny114> noise*

[2022-12-16 08:11:58] <tropicaldandy777> standing infront of the door was kinda troll
[2022-12-16 08:11:59] <YSLExplicit> @therealchicity alb
[2022-12-16 08:12:00] <%Eggstrovert> also bro slurp??? bruhhhh. How do you pick someone up who has virtually no competitive experience
[2022-12-16 08:12:04] <+therealchicity> is alb good igl?

[2022-12-16 08:12:15] <YSLExplicit> lol egg why u typing still
[2022-12-16 08:12:17] <Malformata> @therealchicity alb and snipe both igl, pretty sure
[2022-12-16 08:12:18] <YSLExplicit> invalid
[2022-12-16 08:12:20] <+mydestiny114> @Eggstrovert one of the top players in the game so thats why
[2022-12-16 08:12:25] <%Eggstrovert> ah yes
[2022-12-16 08:12:26] <+mydestiny114> are u ignorant lol
[2022-12-16 08:12:29] <honda_nsx_gt> Alb is a mid IGL
[2022-12-16 08:12:31] <pirate6i9> and actually fucking listen to each other. holy fuck
[2022-12-16 08:12:39] <JoeDirt1428> @eggstrovert damn bro be a real man and @ him @slurpeeg_
[2022-12-16 08:12:44] <%Eggstrovert> if being able to shoot your gun was a prerequisite for ALGS 10% of controller players could be in ALGS.
[2022-12-16 08:12:45] <+CHAL1400> good call here to push
[2022-12-16 08:12:46] <pirate6i9> the not listening to each other is a super L
[2022-12-16 08:12:55] <wierdchammp> @eggstrovert he on the top 10 kills at a lan on a no name team
[2022-12-16 08:13:02] <n0_bo_di> @eggstrovert i mean everyone was new to comp at some point
[2022-12-16 08:13:05] <book503> @Eggstrovert you cant be real
[2022-12-16 08:13:05] <+mydestiny114> Thats the most brainded opinion every eg
[2022-12-16 08:13:07] <+therealchicity> both snipe and alb r really good.  i thought they would dominate but...
[2022-12-16 08:13:09] <lkobashi> Snipedown vs doors
[2022-12-16 08:13:11] <+StolenSnoman> @YSLExplicit they still wouldve been tied with ORN in overall standings and woulda won the tie breaker
[2022-12-16 08:13:15] <+mydestiny114> @Eggstrovert your not real KEKW
[2022-12-16 08:13:16] <+zhypanova> very silly take egg
[2022-12-16 08:13:23] <book503> this egg dude has to be AI
[2022-12-16 08:13:24] <tripsrt> @therealchicity bad team chem in my opin'
[2022-12-16 08:13:25] <%th3illusion> snipe was not fraggin today
[2022-12-16 08:13:27] <jonathnhuerta> 😂
[2022-12-16 08:13:32] <YSLExplicit> albs pov went brazy
[2022-12-16 08:13:42] <@prideee_> handsome fella
[2022-12-16 08:13:50] <%Eggstrovert> lol. The entire theme with this team is "first time for everything." first time IGLing. First time playing in comp. You wanna get to LAN? You play the role you are USED TO and you dont have so many variables that will fuck your chances at lan.
[2022-12-16 08:13:52] <honda_nsx_gt> They got 17th or 18th today?
[2022-12-16 08:13:52] <+mydestiny114> wat place they get here
[2022-12-16 08:13:59] <tripsrt> 20
[2022-12-16 08:14:03] <YSLExplicit> they got 12th
[2022-12-16 08:14:06] <+StolenSnoman> 16th
[2022-12-16 08:14:06] <+therealchicity> is slurp as good as snipe/alb?
[2022-12-16 08:14:07] <YSLExplicit> i think
[2022-12-16 08:14:07] <%th3illusion> 5th
[2022-12-16 08:14:10] <+mydestiny114> tldr egg is AI
[2022-12-16 08:14:14] <chad_papi> Egg while I agree with you somewhat you gotta chill out w Alb hate lol. Wildin rn
[2022-12-16 08:14:16] <+mydestiny114> LUL
[2022-12-16 08:14:17] <YSLExplicit> this game was huge which made them finish 20th
[2022-12-16 08:14:18] <+zhypanova> @Eggstrovert they are fans bro, relax
[2022-12-16 08:14:19] <YSLExplicit> overall
[2022-12-16 08:14:20] <Expadable> @therealchicity time will tell
[2022-12-16 08:14:24] <tropicaldandy777> this game actually saved them
[2022-12-16 08:14:27] <%Eggstrovert> also snipe hasn't played in a while but that's not as relevant. The fact that this team was a shoo in for ALGS is fucked.
[2022-12-16 08:14:27] <honda_nsx_gt> 16th, thanks
[2022-12-16 08:14:41] <+StolenSnoman> jesus. 5th in this game, 16th on the day, and 20th overall
[2022-12-16 08:14:52] <UnsteadyShot91> zach whats next for u
[2022-12-16 08:14:52] <wierdchammp> @therealchicity he's getting there but snipe and alb just have so much experience
[2022-12-16 08:14:53] <pirate6i9> @eggstrovert bruhhhhhhh
[2022-12-16 08:14:58] <%Eggstrovert> idk I just dont like faze
[2022-12-16 08:15:00] <book503> also i feel like faze came into today feeling like they needed to explode every game which kind of messed up the vibes a bit imo
[2022-12-16 08:15:00] <+CHAL1400> why is snipe on eva and not car?
[2022-12-16 08:15:03] <+therealchicity> i dont think anyone was hating =/
[2022-12-16 08:15:11] <n0_bo_di> @eggstrovert yeah yeah hardstuck silver
[2022-12-16 08:15:13] <%Eggstrovert> also sweet for some reason but tbh his hair makes him look cute
[2022-12-16 08:15:16] <+jmoneysniper2> @eggstrovert bruh why you do negative

[2022-12-16 08:15:18] <+StolenSnoman> @CHAL1400 he got respawned
[2022-12-16 08:15:24] <+mydestiny114> dude egg u just dont have the right to an opinion about who is good at the game unless youve competed lmao
[2022-12-16 08:15:27] <+jmoneysniper2> so
[2022-12-16 08:15:27] <plycaeus> oh shit fr? never would’ve guessed LUL @eggstrovert
[2022-12-16 08:15:30] <taejuice> Zach: "i killed your whole family, respecfully"

[2022-12-16 08:15:57] <+mydestiny114> if u takin his sside u arent real
[2022-12-16 08:16:01] <fortunqq> @eggstrovert should have seen sweet hair when he got signed

[2022-12-16 08:16:36] <honda_nsx_gt> Slurp often clutters his team's comm. Not good.
[2022-12-16 08:16:36] <+zhypanova> @mydestiny114 just your statement is copium, im not taking sides
[2022-12-16 08:16:40] <+therealchicity> zach should just be faze igl
[2022-12-16 08:16:40] <pirate6i9> I know exactly what screws them but not gonna loudcap it
[2022-12-16 08:16:46] <@prideee_> @taejuice ?
[2022-12-16 08:16:48] <+StolenSnoman> @mydestiny114 that's a terrible take. You should be able to have an opinion on something  and be able to voice it even if you haven't done it yourself...
[2022-12-16 08:16:51] <pirate6i9> there was a moment that seems to have been carrying over
[2022-12-16 08:16:52] <%Eggstrovert> there is no "Side". Its just an objective observation.
[2022-12-16 08:16:57] <!slurpeeg_> @honda_nsx_gt bruh i speak the least
[2022-12-16 08:17:06] <+mydestiny114> @StolenSnoman u can have opinion but it isnt valid
[2022-12-16 08:17:08] <!slurpeeg_> lmfaooo

[2022-12-16 08:17:11] <%Eggstrovert> tbf I have no comp experience either
[2022-12-16 08:17:19] <%Eggstrovert> so I could be wrong
[2022-12-16 08:17:21] <tripsrt> shouldve listened to alb at this point honestly
[2022-12-16 08:17:22] <wierdchammp> @zachmazer you playing with shooby and fuhhnq at 1:30 cst?
[2022-12-16 08:17:28] <JoeDirt1428> @slurpeeg_ that is facts
[2022-12-16 08:17:28] <book503> @slurpeeg_ i think he means sometimes they're not meaningful comms with all due respect
[2022-12-16 08:17:38] <+ryyy69> @slurpeeg_ you clutter the comms by not talking at all obviously Kappa
[2022-12-16 08:17:44] <+mydestiny114> @slurpeeg_ bots are disrespectin u lmao
[2022-12-16 08:17:46] <pirate6i9> know exactly is a strong phrase that isn't accurate.
[2022-12-16 08:17:48] <chad_papi> @book503 lol damn you didn’t have to spell it out like that
[2022-12-16 08:17:55] <Itztunnelsteamy> mac can cross with smokes?
[2022-12-16 08:18:00] <%KJCastleberry> @slurpeeg_ snipeFace
[2022-12-16 08:18:01] <n0_bo_di> @eggstrovert then stfu, don't be toxic if ur opinion is to the left of irrelevant
[2022-12-16 08:18:01] <book503> didnt mean to sound mean
[2022-12-16 08:18:03] <pirate6i9> think is a better word
[2022-12-16 08:18:10] <+StolenSnoman> @mydestiny114 ? I haven't played competitve apex, but I can say after watching comp for the past 2 years that nafen is easily a top 3 mnk player.
[2022-12-16 08:18:17] <%that_pater_boy> mac can croos with smokes...valk has smokes?

[2022-12-16 08:50:09] <+chase_intern_jammer> @Eggstrovert they actually think about where theyre going now
[2022-12-16 08:50:12] <+mydestiny114> the top teams all have 100 points in PAC NORTH
[2022-12-16 08:50:18] <+jmoneysniper2> evan was going crazyyyyyy
[2022-12-16 08:50:26] <%Eggstrovert> Evan is insane
[2022-12-16 08:50:26] <ok_arturrr> the amount of times tsm had no ammo today 💀
[2022-12-16 08:50:28] <%Eggstrovert> people were doubting him for so long
[2022-12-16 08:50:35] <%Eggstrovert> hal would not have agreed to sign him if he was shit
[2022-12-16 08:50:47] <twisted853> no way iron wing over iron volt right???
[2022-12-16 08:50:48] <pirate6i9> @eggstrovert I was low-key sleep on how good he is
[2022-12-16 08:50:58] <16schaeffer> i find it extremely hard to evaluate the Asia teams. they play a whole different game sometimes
[2022-12-16 08:50:59] <+chase_intern_jammer> evan is the best roller in the game.. he just has roller brain like nobodys business
[2022-12-16 08:51:11] <%Eggstrovert> I think the reason thought he was bad is because hal was constantly changing how he wanted Evan to play
[2022-12-16 08:51:16] <%Eggstrovert> first he had him play close
[2022-12-16 08:51:19] <%Eggstrovert> then he had him play like snipe
[2022-12-16 08:51:25] <pirate6i9> @chase_intern_jammer idk about that he plays really good angles
[2022-12-16 08:51:25] <%Eggstrovert> now he has him take space
[2022-12-16 08:51:36] <+therealchicity> wow
