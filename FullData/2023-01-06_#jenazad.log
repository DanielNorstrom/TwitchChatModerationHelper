[2023-01-06 04:54:47] <JoeK5> all my crit chance/crit dam/eff gear finally has a purpose... on SC Jena
[2023-01-06 04:54:47] <%Remotoz> it is laggy

[2023-01-06 04:55:53] <%$Urjent> hi Jena
[2023-01-06 04:55:58] <JoeK5> all boss stages
[2023-01-06 04:55:58] <%F3scorn> That means you can now background battle AP and use it for catalyst in unrecorded history shops.
[2023-01-06 04:55:58] <%sum1Kind> so im guessing the fodders will be very difficult to obtain

[2023-01-06 06:12:22] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2023-01-06 07:07:00] <%+WildNeptune> Honestly? If you think about it, ML Ray is the best character E7 has to offer. His specials allow for mind games and control, the list goes on. While a top tier character, he requires the player to have a diverse skill set and deep understanding of the game to play. He's an underplayed, underappreciated gem of the smash roster but unfortunately, I think that less competent players like Derp have a long way to go before utilizing him with his full potential.

[2023-01-06 08:07:35] <%+KeinInugami> @simdis1 a lil bit if you go conventional counter units like belian, but there are some bad combos like aria/senya that can really abuse that super hard

[2023-01-06 11:07:18] <vanivan239586038183905213> while on a downward trajectory during a jump, hold down and tap attack. dont hold it, jsut tap

[2023-01-06 11:08:27] <GrimWisp> well Devs aren't from NA or anything i think so probably a 2nd language diff
[2023-01-06 11:08:46] <vanivan239586038183905213> they probably said something like "prostrate thy offensiveness while the fleetness of thy leap is past" or some shit 4Head
[2023-01-06 11:09:28] <darkversion> The jumping mechanic isnt it just like bouncing on it?

[2023-01-06 11:11:05] <%mrfriedricee> back when the game released, the  jumping mechanic was pretty demanding so they made it easier by pressing r2 + attack at the same time
[2023-01-06 11:11:10] <%WalkTheFox> didn know eversoul was on maintenance
