[2022-12-16 00:12:11] <woodhead81> I'm sick. chat vote: pho or ramen? gogo 1 pho, 2 ramen.
[2022-12-16 00:12:15] <%snoop_frfr> with all the eggs you should rebrand to NoHensGamer
[2022-12-16 00:12:29] <Qemist> actual good one KEKW
[2022-12-16 00:12:43] <%Penguin_Edd> hens is where its at, they make op cards
[2022-12-16 00:13:07] <Qemist> He's a very good deckbuilder, hens this list.
[2022-12-16 00:13:24] <%Penguin_Edd> im really enjoying the meta tbh
[2022-12-16 00:13:53] <%+Dawshtin> i quit before witchwood, and this is the most fun the game has been for me
[2022-12-16 00:13:55] <+thegreygecko> I've still been enjoying phylactery lmao
[2022-12-16 00:13:56] <+Xenophus> 02
[2022-12-16 00:13:57] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> people just like fast games
[2022-12-16 00:14:02] <+TurnOneDelver> meta is very fun, a lot of balance, just need to slow the combo down like a turn
[2022-12-16 00:14:16] <%+Xeath5> i just cant... i dont understand why i get to lose a game just because i queued into druid and dare not to play full aggro faceroll or 20/20 turn 4 minions
[2022-12-16 00:14:24] <%+Xeath5> i dont understand why this is a thing for more than a year now
[2022-12-16 00:14:35] <%+scotch1986> @dawshtin been a while since I played to, got the pre purchase and been loving this one
[2022-12-16 00:14:50] <%snoop_frfr> druid remains the most polarizing and uninteresting class to face and nobody is surprised
[2022-12-16 00:14:59] <+helix_sky> havent seen too many druids in legend
[2022-12-16 00:15:29] <ThisSilhouetteLie> yeah, druids have disappeared
[2022-12-16 00:15:37] <%snoop_frfr> even when druid isn't strong it's still a faceroll either way the game works out
[2022-12-16 00:15:45] <silko_inc> druid is broken. seen one today play over 15 cards on turn 7 to reset his mana go back to 8 mana, build a team and take down over 30 health one turn lmao
[2022-12-16 00:15:47] <%Penguin_Edd> renathal is nice into objection
[2022-12-16 00:15:49] <+helix_sky> finley - objection - clear
[2022-12-16 00:15:52] <%+Xeath5> i dont mind dh or rogue atm
[2022-12-16 00:15:52] <FlyingPuncake> what lineup for worlds do you think has the biggest edge? @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-16 00:16:22] <SadLH> we lost the egg!!! DansGame
[2022-12-16 00:16:25] <Qemist> i think druids powerlevel isn't above other good stuff, it's just much easier to pilot, so more people in relatively high ladder but pre-legend get stomped by idiots using it, hence the frustration with it.
[2022-12-16 00:16:27] <%snoop_frfr> randomly generated bloodlust incoming :)
[2022-12-16 00:16:30] <%+OverthinkingJohny> Skill was witnessed

[2022-12-16 00:16:49] <+helix_sky> the egg just took out 2 secrets in one turn ... OP
[2022-12-16 00:16:52] <silko_inc> @Qemist It was against Thijs at 40 rank
[2022-12-16 00:16:54] <+helix_sky> fear the egg
[2022-12-16 00:16:56] <%+ucdchris1> one of these days your gonna accidentally buff the 1/4
[2022-12-16 00:17:04] <erich68> if you think pawns are the most important piece in chess, you better stick to hearthstone
[2022-12-16 00:17:12] <ThisSilhouetteLie> Druid loses to both rogue and dh now, so no point playin it
[2022-12-16 00:17:18] <Qemist> @silko_inc wich is the exeption at high legend. it seems to be pretty rare high up
[2022-12-16 00:17:36] <ColonelBlabby> pretty sure the best piece in chess is the tophat
[2022-12-16 00:17:37] <!%pocket_train> Sticking to Hearthstone together FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-16 00:17:54] <SadLH> pretty sure someone needs to fix his Kappa detector
[2022-12-16 00:17:55] <Kallenger> living mindblast Pog
[2022-12-16 00:17:57] <%Penguin_Edd> we all should stick to hearthstone tbh
[2022-12-16 00:18:08] <%+earl_of_darkness> Queen op, needs nerfed
[2022-12-16 00:18:12] <%+ucdchris1> i wonder what they picked Kappa
[2022-12-16 00:18:15] <FlyingPuncake> i want a 1/4 chance for the queen to randomly swaps spots with a pawn
[2022-12-16 00:18:19] <FlyingPuncake> only then will it be a good game
[2022-12-16 00:18:22] <erich68> fireball was an easy choice....
[2022-12-16 00:18:24] <%+earl_of_darkness> no patch notes for thousands of years
[2022-12-16 00:18:33] <%+Xeath5> tbh chess sucks.... i cant go back in time to force my parents to give me some chess teacher just to be able to compete
[2022-12-16 00:18:35] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> chess with RNG would actually be pretty lit
[2022-12-16 00:18:38] <PaladinIRL> Chess is bullshit can‚Äôt even discover new pieces 0/10
[2022-12-16 00:18:58] <%WezaRipoto> @Lvl_100_Magikarp thats just TFT lol
[2022-12-16 00:18:58] <%+ucdchris1> you can discover new pieces its called getting the pawn to the other side
[2022-12-16 00:19:02] <%+Xeath5> nut you can discover pieces in chess Aware
[2022-12-16 00:19:04] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> you can evolve pawns though

[2022-12-16 00:19:09] <%snoop_frfr> should be able to plaguespreader the enemy king as wincon
[2022-12-16 00:19:14] <SadLH> chess only has one class....
[2022-12-16 00:19:39] <tenaciousbe> chess should have deathrattle
[2022-12-16 00:19:55] <SadLH> buffs too
[2022-12-16 00:20:01] <tenaciousbe> yeah lets make a reddit post about that
[2022-12-16 00:20:08] <%WezaRipoto> chess onyxia: if you have at least 1 pawn alive, your queen is immune
[2022-12-16 00:20:08] <SadLH> divine shields?
[2022-12-16 00:20:09] <+Smeet2> How can chess be fun? You just push pieces into each other. Where's the win condition?

[2022-12-16 00:20:12] <oqiwm> chess needs disruption
[2022-12-16 00:20:14] <%+earl_of_darkness> 2nd should start with an extra pawn

[2022-12-16 01:25:46] <+dawgsem> how does your opponent win
[2022-12-16 01:26:01] <@%littleballofhate> @nohandsgamer just had an interesting conversation on reddit that mirrors what you had said earlier: they claimed that Plague Priest is an attrition deck with no win condition, and I responded by saying I frequently end the game with 3/4/5 mi'das on board that represent 16+ damage. They responded that it doesn't count because it is gradual rather than "explosive"
[2022-12-16 01:26:10] <%+saa_soli> @dawgsem his ping hits for 7
[2022-12-16 01:26:11] <+DrBogart420> does the vision go into the deck if you finley?
[2022-12-16 01:26:28] <@%littleballofhate> @nohandsgamer this reinforces your point that "win condition" has become synonymous with OTK
[2022-12-16 01:26:35] <Atpeta> opponent wins clicking concede and queueing better next time
[2022-12-16 01:26:55] <vayazu2> rattlegore was a win condition. a slow one but it counts

[2022-12-16 01:28:10] <vayazu2> the deck is more proactive than barrens priest because of mi'da. that much is true
[2022-12-16 01:29:11] <yugioh3dmaster> idk nohands, 7 is the number of mana spent to cast Mutanus Kappa

[2022-12-16 01:30:26] <sz_sniper> people thinks renathal is bad to the game fucking non sense
[2022-12-16 01:30:30] <%rotemv3> Removal isnt disruption
[2022-12-16 01:30:44] <+Drakonix000> disruption has to exist in HS if we want powerful interesting finishers to exist imo
[2022-12-16 01:30:45] <yugioh3dmaster> Removing a Brann seems disruptive to me trumpW
[2022-12-16 01:30:46] <%WezaRipoto> good design is when I win, bad design is when I lose
[2022-12-16 01:30:51] <vayazu2> mutanus has been a healthy disruption card for more than a year. no serious complaints about it
[2022-12-16 01:31:04] <Zaxlor> It was at that moment... NoHands knew when he dun fuk up monkaW
[2022-12-16 01:31:05] <yugioh3dmaster> you should put Reno Jackson in your deck Kappa @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-16 01:31:22] <%+saa_soli> i think you only resolved one plaguespreader
[2022-12-16 01:31:25] <SamOnIce_> What was the better play?
[2022-12-16 01:31:27] <%Penguin_Edd> imagine if plaguespreader couldnt hit itself, unlucky tho
[2022-12-16 01:31:36] <JoeSnow4Sho> It happens. You are more than just that 1 play. Don't forget that.
[2022-12-16 01:32:14] <vayazu2> removal spells technically disrupt them

[2022-12-16 01:35:26] <+Drakonix000> i think a lot of people fucked up their attention span so reading is harder
[2022-12-16 01:35:27] <+lawrencelord> Reading is great, but reading whilst listening along to the audiobook, that hits different.

[2022-12-16 01:57:26] <@%littleballofhate> @nohandsgamer from the perspective of a combo player whose combo goes off by turn 9, a true attrition deck and a control deck with a win condition that comes online on turn 12-13 are indistinguishable, because the game is over from them by turn 13 anyway. Thoughts?
[2022-12-16 01:57:29] <%kaiserwroth> your plaguespreader hit his spitter
[2022-12-16 01:57:54] <bizjeet5> svalna can be useful vs control pally as well

[2022-12-16 02:00:49] <+nonameswtf> @Emperor_Troll lol
[2022-12-16 02:00:50] <%+Xeath5> so what you are saying is "no1 should get their combo disrupted" when said by boon and rogue players means they want to free win cuz no other deck is that fast? nohandsKappa

[2022-12-16 02:01:14] <%+illegaldanish24> If you run Quest Priest on the toilet, you‚Äôre playing an IRL quest where the reward is to have 0% circulation in your legs
[2022-12-16 02:01:19] <+Tinyfred> @Tinyfred I'm sure he has beat them, but the match up is net negative in terms of stats.
[2022-12-16 02:01:24] <yugioh3dmaster> because then they'd be copying off of Shadowverse, that's literally the SV train of thought :)

[2022-12-16 02:04:43] <+clusterfkuc> Teotar is even more valuable as a late mid-game disruption card now tho
[2022-12-16 02:04:43] <XoBiEbErFeVeRoX> those people will also just complain about everything
[2022-12-16 02:04:50] <!%pocket_train> Early Scholomance felt like near perfection
[2022-12-16 02:04:53] <XoBiEbErFeVeRoX> they'll find another thing to complain about
[2022-12-16 02:05:01] <+hilaryisthedevil> their three employees are trying their best
[2022-12-16 02:05:03] <%kaiserwroth> sounds just like typical complaining bitches
[2022-12-16 02:05:22] <Haenw_> Damn I thought the general thought about current meta was that it's interesting and fun
[2022-12-16 02:05:28] <gseyren> @pocket_train oh the kael thas guardian animals druid days i love them
[2022-12-16 02:05:33] <vayazu2> what people don't like is being disrupted
[2022-12-16 02:05:34] <TJSCOUSER_> this decks win condition feels way healthier than what rogue or boon priest are doing
[2022-12-16 02:06:23] <ioreign1> This is a pure blue deck in magic
[2022-12-16 02:06:27] <gseyren> people just dont like losing
[2022-12-16 02:06:29] <+clusterfkuc> so what's the win condition for this deck you're playing then?
[2022-12-16 02:06:31] <+cinnamonchair> nah the meta stinks every single person brought rogue and priest to worlds...
[2022-12-16 02:06:32] <vayazu2> on twitter a control warrior player didn't like that plaguespreader disrupted his silence for mi'da
[2022-12-16 02:06:35] <metroidreference> interaction with the opponent sure isn't fun!!
[2022-12-16 02:06:36] <!%pocket_train> In terms of disruption I think this deck hits the sweet spot personally
[2022-12-16 02:06:39] <SnekeTV> I HATE interaction with my solitaire deck Kappa
[2022-12-16 02:06:42] <grimBleeper> PepoG beat up egg priest with sustained threats because he can handle big loads
[2022-12-16 02:06:45] <Hyoob> I'm listening
[2022-12-16 02:06:49] <ssawyer10> people also don't like having 1/2 the mana of the other player on turn 6
[2022-12-16 02:06:54] <XoBiEbErFeVeRoX> there are a certain subset of mildly popular streamers who are always looking for the "one true meta" and 99 percent of their content is negative. @nohandsgamer
[2022-12-16 02:06:56] <+Ranlit_HS> Yeah the disruption with Plaguespreader is great
[2022-12-16 02:07:04] <+clusterfkuc> cool
[2022-12-16 02:07:17] <gseyren> i prefer the complete boredom that is facing this priest deck than getting completely blasted turn 4 by boon priest or rogue
[2022-12-16 02:07:18] <Caelis87> Patch 26.0 patch notes: "Made it so people's opponents will never again win the game"
[2022-12-16 02:07:18] <Darwal> @xobieberfeverox I wonder who that is Kappa
[2022-12-16 02:07:19] <TJSCOUSER_> id rather face 5 games vs this deck than play vs a boon priest that just makes infinite/infinite stats on turn 5
[2022-12-16 02:07:32] <@%littleballofhate> @nohandsgamer I think a lot of people just don't like slow games, but they're afraid to say that out loud so come up with indirect ways to say that
[2022-12-16 02:07:45] <paradoxymorphone> I watch Feno because he's good, and NHG because he's handsome. If there was a Venn diagram between the two there'd be no overlap Kappa
[2022-12-16 02:07:55] <vayazu2> i definitely dont like slow games
[2022-12-16 02:08:11] <grimBleeper> @littleballofhate SMOrc what do you mean afraid?
[2022-12-16 02:08:11] <AnacondaHL> @paradoxymorphone fenoUn
[2022-12-16 02:08:12] <vayazu2> but dont want to force game lentgh on others
[2022-12-16 02:08:20] <%plebian_3> i haven't played hearthstone in 10 years
[2022-12-16 02:08:28] <+hilaryisthedevil> play aggro durid and lose all your games by turn 4
[2022-12-16 02:08:29] <XoBiEbErFeVeRoX> @darwal I honestly don't have anyone in particular in mind bc when I see ppl like that I just kinda turn them off it's a decent amount of ppl though tbh
[2022-12-16 02:08:30] <gseyren> why bother setting max mana to 10 in a game that does pass turn 6 80% of the time
[2022-12-16 02:08:41] <+cinnamonchair> i play thief rogue and die in turn 7 every game
[2022-12-16 02:08:46] <%+yodacao> yeah zoo was like that win in 4min or less
[2022-12-16 02:08:55] <yugioh3dmaster> in Shadowverse, slow decks simply don't exist :)
[2022-12-16 02:08:56] <paradoxymorphone> protip: don't play slow decks on the toilet if you want to be able to feel your legs when you're done
[2022-12-16 02:09:11] <%+haoxus_wayne> the game I like the most is winning slowly, least is losing slowly. is that an argument?
[2022-12-16 02:09:16] <scentofmullet> the same people complaining about games being to long will complain that the games are now too short
[2022-12-16 02:09:17] <metroidreference> shadowverse used to have slow decks...:(
[2022-12-16 02:09:17] <SnekeTV> only play aggro on the toilet is the lesson here
[2022-12-16 02:09:18] <%+yodacao> lots or reason i dont play marvel snap lol  only 1 type of playstyle
[2022-12-16 02:09:23] <@%littleballofhate> @nohandsgamer I agree but we need to have that conversation instead of tiptoeing around the subject
[2022-12-16 02:09:24] <ssawyer10> @paradoxymorphone amen to this
[2022-12-16 02:09:24] <Emeraath> Blizz could just cut total mana in half. Game goes faster YEP
[2022-12-16 02:09:25] <Darwal> @xobieberfeverox I can think of 2 notable people who fit that bill, and they ironically hate each other LUL
[2022-12-16 02:09:31] <vayazu2> criticising disruption is not done just by stormwind fans
[2022-12-16 02:09:44] <timocrx> !quest
[2022-12-16 02:09:44] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.
[2022-12-16 02:09:47] <!%pocket_train> Design philosophy lately has seemed to be to appease one half at a time
[2022-12-16 02:09:48] <paradoxymorphone> @ssawyer10 hunter was invented for toilet games
[2022-12-16 02:09:55] <grossetete12> Do you think that plaguespreader should reveal what card it transformed ?
[2022-12-16 02:09:56] <+Kingm00> People really hate playing HS solitaire then a card like Theotar comes out and they demand more HS solitaire
[2022-12-16 02:09:56] <pro100chelovec> does she have no minions in hand? where the plague icons? i don't get it
[2022-12-16 02:10:02] <grimBleeper> as a SMOrc player, i like disruption because it's usually low tempo so i can go face more
[2022-12-16 02:10:05] <gseyren> turn 7?
[2022-12-16 02:10:09] <ssawyer10> @paradoxymorphone Thats why I have the golden hunter hero
[2022-12-16 02:10:10] <Darwal> ideally, the game would have a wide variety of archetypes to play, but has good balance and skill is rewarded more
[2022-12-16 02:10:11] <gseyren> are you guys getting to turn 7?
[2022-12-16 02:10:14] <Emeraath> why do we even have Warrior? Sadge
[2022-12-16 02:10:23] <%+Xeath5> they didnt like warrior
[2022-12-16 02:10:26] <ActionJunkie> there's some parallels to this and when hearthstone became a thing when MTG was king of CCGs.  I think there's space for MTG, hearthstone, and snap
[2022-12-16 02:10:26] <%+Xeath5> so they killed warrior
[2022-12-16 02:10:48] <vayazu2> it's a difficult compromise between how much rng cards should have
[2022-12-16 02:10:55] <+Kingm00> Why even play an opponent you should just play cards in an order and just win or better yet you win on your screen and your opponent wins on theirs
[2022-12-16 02:10:59] <+clusterfkuc> DK is the new control warrior
[2022-12-16 02:11:03] <+dineria> I don't understand the whole argument... if someone doesn't like long games just don't play slow deck and only play Rouge and you solve the problem on your own. either you win by minute 7 or concede
[2022-12-16 02:11:08] <+cinnamonchair> they printed dh, mage and hunter cards this expansion were all promoting solitaire otk decks
[2022-12-16 02:11:08] <ioreign1> Hogger should summon plaguespeaders, thoughts?
[2022-12-16 02:11:24] <+AComcastEmployee> are we back to salsa Pog ?
[2022-12-16 02:11:27] <yugioh3dmaster> @ActionJunkie and then Magic made the 30th anniversary edition Jebaited
[2022-12-16 02:11:46] <ActionJunkie> lol @yugioh3dmaster
[2022-12-16 02:12:11] <grimBleeper> @ActionJunkie Kappa if you can't afford it then you're not the right audience

[2022-12-16 02:12:31] <ActionJunkie> MTG arena is way cheaper than paper magic so it's evolved too
[2022-12-16 02:12:35] <yugioh3dmaster> @AComcastEmployee hello there notkohComfy
[2022-12-16 02:12:37] <%+Xeath5> i hate the strawman argument when people say "because of renathal games take 4ever" thats so untrue. games only take 4ever if you DECIDE TO QUEUE UP a slow deck
[2022-12-16 02:12:53] <+AComcastEmployee> @yugioh3dmaster acomcaCRINGE
[2022-12-16 02:13:25] <+Tinyfred> @Xeath5 Average HS game SHOULD be around 8-10 turns. not 6. So I dont mind renethal
[2022-12-16 02:13:43] <+madangryupsetpuppy> does he have a sire?
[2022-12-16 02:13:43] <+Tinyfred> The fact a TON of decks are just unplayable because the meta is so fast is not healthy
[2022-12-16 02:13:44] <%+Xeath5> @Tinyfred i want all of it... slow games fast games
[2022-12-16 02:13:49] <%mambaforev3r> doesn't she have a second flamebringer?
[2022-12-16 02:13:51] <Blastkool> She could have second Astalor from the brann
[2022-12-16 02:13:52] <ActionJunkie> we find out
[2022-12-16 02:13:55] <yugioh3dmaster> Denathrius notkohHuh
[2022-12-16 02:13:57] <%TentoMan> they have second astalor
[2022-12-16 02:13:59] <tasty_teardrop> he still has another astalor from the brann no?
[2022-12-16 02:13:59] <+Tinyfred> @Xeath5 Yes they should all be able to co-exist.
[2022-12-16 02:14:02] <%+fbirgys> got whirlpooled innit
[2022-12-16 02:14:08] <%TentoMan> or right

[2022-12-16 02:14:10] <+AComcastEmployee> EZ Clap
[2022-12-16 02:14:10] <%TentoMan> lol
[2022-12-16 02:14:23] <+Tinyfred> I'm mostly a fast deck player anyways, but I don't want slow decks to be nonexistent
[2022-12-16 02:14:23] <afroAlCo> EZ ramp drood deleted
[2022-12-16 02:14:43] <grimBleeper> @Tinyfred SMOrc we need slow decks to beat up
[2022-12-16 02:14:48] <Darwal> ideally, the game would have a wide variety of archetypes to play, but has good balance and skill is rewarded more
[2022-12-16 02:14:52] <vayazu2> tech cards in specific matchups are fine
[2022-12-16 02:15:02] <vayazu2> theotar at 4 was not that
[2022-12-16 02:15:07] <!%pocket_train> They seem to be finding it hard to reach a middle-ground which is understandable
[2022-12-16 02:15:13] <yugioh3dmaster> i think another problem going for DK is that it wasnt in the first set of a rotation Jebaited
[2022-12-16 02:15:20] <MaxThaGr8> old hearthstone PepeHands
[2022-12-16 02:15:22] <+Tinyfred> I mean, the worse metas were definitely the slow ones with Contol Warrior & Control Priest as T1
[2022-12-16 02:15:24] <+Tinyfred> To be FAIR
[2022-12-16 02:15:42] <mariomar_0> i want a disruption game over a random into random into random like lackeys or spellmage
[2022-12-16 02:15:58] <ssawyer10> @Tinyfred disagree KEKW those are two of my favorite decks
[2022-12-16 02:16:04] <+Tinyfred> Metas where the opponent does nothing but clear your board instead of actually playing the game SUCKS
[2022-12-16 02:16:11] <!%pocket_train> I think curvestone should exist in some form always
[2022-12-16 02:16:15] <Darwal> minion based aggro like aggro druid? it's really strong right now
[2022-12-16 02:16:16] <%+turkdawg> I have a better than 50% win rate thru D4 with murlock warlock
[2022-12-16 02:16:21] <ActionJunkie> ignore the group think some.  defintely hard these days
[2022-12-16 02:16:31] <ioreign1> Make hearthstone into gwent
[2022-12-16 02:16:31] <+Eranidor> one of my first legend climbs was mit Silas OTK warrior
[2022-12-16 02:16:35] <vayazu2> it can be done in a good and healthy way
[2022-12-16 02:16:38] <+Eranidor> i loved this list so much
[2022-12-16 02:16:39] <Blastkool> I miss D6 Warlock Sadge
[2022-12-16 02:16:39] <+qwertyham115> distruption is definitely not bad. just bad when it happens to me
[2022-12-16 02:16:51] <+leukHS> the average redditor has no idea for game design
[2022-12-16 02:16:56] <!%pocket_train> Kreygasm
[2022-12-16 02:17:02] <+apagne> quests were god awful DansGame
[2022-12-16 02:17:09] <jonnylaw730> Pirate warrior?
[2022-12-16 02:17:13] <+Eranidor> with every armor card and if you have the armor just play Silas and shield slam the dude EZ game
[2022-12-16 02:17:15] <pro100chelovec> what about plaguespreaders in decks like blood dk? i mean u already run mutanus, cuz of disruption, plaguedudes do same thing for 4 mana @nohandsgamer
[2022-12-16 02:17:18] <Darwal> removal is fine, but disruption where you win by a coin flip is kind of crappy
[2022-12-16 02:17:21] <jonnylaw730> Quest warrrior and mage
[2022-12-16 02:17:23] <vayazu2> agreed let's not go back to stormwind. that's a different discussion than how to print disruption cards though
[2022-12-16 02:17:25] <%+thom_smorc> I quit for like a year after stormwind
[2022-12-16 02:17:41] <tftplayer2> i quit when quest warlock was bull shit
[2022-12-16 02:17:56] <+apagne> same, absolutely hated fatigue lock
[2022-12-16 02:17:56] <%+ucdchris1> there should be a seperate counter for the amount of games versus jewfye
[2022-12-16 02:18:00] <%+ucdchris1> must be like 10 games now lol
[2022-12-16 02:18:01] <Aptesun> maybe the problem is each class only had 1 quest, maybe each class needs 10 quests

[2022-12-16 02:22:04] <%kaiserwroth> if your opponent takes your spot it just means they can do your job as well and you should go find a better one KEKW
[2022-12-16 02:22:33] <ActionJunkie> so you are speaking of value while in game.  those pillars make sense

[2022-12-16 02:29:00] <%Penguin_Edd> its hard because you need to disrupt, but if you wif on the plague its sad times

[2022-12-16 02:29:21] <grimBleeper> if you like quest then you should suck eggs and then put those eggs in your deck
[2022-12-16 02:29:34] <%+sex_panther> Lol is that why we use eggs to balance out how unfair this deck could be
[2022-12-16 02:29:37] <%+borindak> Maybe you're a kind person, trying to let your opponent steal a win condition

[2022-12-16 02:45:05] <@^Nightbot> NoHands is able to click with NaturalPoint's SmartNav and DwellClick. SmartNav tracks the movement of his head via a dot on his glasses, and if he focuses on one point for a little bit the DwellClick software clicks the mouse. OR he could be using his foot petal to click while eye tracking moves the mouse :) Here's an interview of him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz8K3yAOat8

[2022-12-16 02:50:09] <+Malwontae> A good way to look at it is Worlds lists contain Spirit Guide, and obviously those guys are clueless
[2022-12-16 02:50:13] <%+sex_panther> What about switcharoo to help find plagues? Also draws 2 like spirit but only 3 mana. Obviously no body though
[2022-12-16 02:50:18] <+crustytubesockzz> what is this game

[2022-12-16 02:51:13] <+Scullythekid> this is hearthstone it is a collectable card game
[2022-12-16 02:51:18] <+kebabsredemption> why not procing the objection here?
[2022-12-16 02:51:19] <$Cadian_9th> Mostly have to look at worst case scenario on all these cards. The 5 mana guy could just do nothing sometimes. The upside is 5 mana for like 2 rez, which isn‚Äôt amazing
[2022-12-16 02:51:22] <%+RoboClam> what beats this fucking stupid 30 card druid, running into them every ladder game now

[2022-12-16 21:58:30] <+DraganDE> I was always curious if you retrospectively analyse data and determinants of the number of viewers of your past streams
[2022-12-16 21:58:47] <yugioh3dmaster> https://scryfall.com/card/c16/79/wave-of-reckoning MTG has Lightbomb on a discount trumpW

[2022-12-16 22:02:16] <+DraganDE> I think the relation between deck variety; viewer loyalty & chat interaction is very interesting

[2022-12-16 22:03:58] <+DraganDE> Yeah, I thought it was interesting from a business-sociology perspective, not necessarily for giving prescriptions on how to stream

[2022-12-16 22:09:02] <%+fluffybirdy> genuine question, why is pelican part of the deck?
[2022-12-16 22:09:07] <ankittamta95> i generally ask my waiter what the best restaurant serves, and then i order absolute opposite what he/she suggests
[2022-12-16 22:09:22] <Fennicks47> pelican is a cheap removal spell
[2022-12-16 22:09:48] <jjcorreia19> wait where are the eggs ??????
[2022-12-16 22:09:53] <%+fluffybirdy> i mean it's not like priest has no other removal
[2022-12-16 22:09:55] <%Arkarku> @fluffybirdy he's testing replacements for eggs
[2022-12-16 22:09:55] <Fennicks47> eggs have hatched chat

[2022-12-16 22:11:30] <rexmkh> should I dust my entire collection to build a a current top meta deck before likely nerfs? there's no way blizz would screw me over Kappa
[2022-12-16 22:11:40] <%macaco89> roger, full crafting golden fire rush warrior
[2022-12-16 22:11:59] <SamOnIce_> Good answer, depends on how much you need to craft of it
[2022-12-16 22:12:02] <+cahntchaps> Just swipe and have all the cards, simple
[2022-12-16 22:12:08] <%+Mr_M0jo> if you already have all the cards, go for it
[2022-12-16 22:12:12] <%+fluffybirdy> The only deck where the answer is directly yes was release DH

[2022-12-16 22:12:58] <ColonelBlabby> so youre saying i can either craft this deck or buy organic food?
[2022-12-16 22:13:02] <WickedGoodFM> If you have to craft cards for a control deck, you probably shouldn't, because you probably need to play all the other decks in the meta to understand how to beat them

[2022-12-16 22:13:18] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> aggro druid, always has been
[2022-12-16 22:13:19] <euchid> cheap = aggro druid
[2022-12-16 22:13:21] <sitruuna__> pirate warrior always
[2022-12-16 22:13:27] <ankittamta95> naga priest
[2022-12-16 22:13:36] <WickedGoodFM> Deathrattle rogue is probably the best deck to craft right now
[2022-12-16 22:13:36] <rexmkh> aggro druid was a cheap and competitive deck, too. Someone actually brought aggro druid to worlds
[2022-12-16 22:14:02] <+cahntchaps> Dh is pretty cheap
[2022-12-16 22:14:04] <rexmkh> I found imp lock way more interesting after starting out with aggro druid
[2022-12-16 22:14:04] <grimBleeper> it's still aggro druid, i would've said shockspitter but they nerfed it after 3 days :[
[2022-12-16 22:14:07] <%Arkarku> @WickedGoodFM not when nerfs are inc KEKW
[2022-12-16 22:14:11] <+lawrenc1us> Relic? Just click Vault

[2022-12-16 22:15:19] <yhcho927000> I think dh is fair now everyone either plays it or counters it
[2022-12-16 22:15:22] <WickedGoodFM> @WickedGoodFM The expensive cards in that deck are probably going to be the ones to get nerfed
[2022-12-16 22:15:22] <ankittamta95> i hope they dont nerf graveyard, prayge
[2022-12-16 22:15:27] <SpykoNukov> if the deck is fun and the mirror is interesting it could actually be a real argument, YuGiOh currently have a tier0 format but many argue it's one of the best format the game have seen in years
[2022-12-16 22:15:48] <rexmkh> although quest dh is pretty powerful, worlds demonstrated that it's sometimes inconsistent. See Jarla's mixed dh record at worlds today for reference
[2022-12-16 22:16:13] <+hilaryisthedevil> jarla still advanced though
[2022-12-16 22:17:25] <rexmkh> yeah
[2022-12-16 22:17:47] <+lawrenc1us> What would you bring to Worlds?
[2022-12-16 22:17:51] <Jimmy_Page_> which deck was the best performer
[2022-12-16 22:18:06] <Jimmy_Page_> nah pirate warrior is almost there
[2022-12-16 22:18:06] <+apagne> KEKW
[2022-12-16 22:18:33] <rexmkh> why play control warrior when you can play blood dk? I know warrior got some disruption, but I don't know if it's good enough
[2022-12-16 22:18:40] <euchid> warrior is by far worst class
[2022-12-16 22:18:47] <ankittamta95> unnerf kazakusan = warrior gigachad
[2022-12-16 22:19:12] <Ceribi> nohands didnt qualify for worlds?
[2022-12-16 22:19:19] <MrHandsomeNoodle> why isnt he killing watchpost? how can he afford to play his cards now with only 10 mana Kappa
[2022-12-16 22:19:33] <%WezaRipoto> I hold out hope for nerfs making frost DK more viable, it already seems pretty fun and gives semi freeze mage vibes with all the burst and board freezing
[2022-12-16 22:19:39] <Jimmy_Page_> nohands whats more your type south american girls or eastern european girls?
[2022-12-16 22:19:47] <du6koto> america region are preety weak for worlds

[2022-12-16 22:52:08] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it's also so hard to play the value game without a hero
[2022-12-16 22:52:10] <+drop_table_subs> Does any deck out value this other than the mirror?

[2022-12-16 23:11:19] <%rexmkh> hopefully blizz will make a priest legendary that does the opposite of nozdormu: it gives you more time per turn Kappa
[2022-12-16 23:11:25] <shock_33> cut renathal Kappa
[2022-12-16 23:12:07] <+helix_sky> astalor is the one card i crafted so far this cycle
[2022-12-16 23:12:19] <age_of_snow> At least no snipers beloved card Ilucia
[2022-12-16 23:12:19] <dvzps5> what card do u think can be slot to astalor?
[2022-12-16 23:12:30] <%JonsyBones> Rope him when you have lethal. Ultimate payback
[2022-12-16 23:12:31] <%rexmkh> astalor seems like a safe craft. if it gets nerfed, blame druid
[2022-12-16 23:12:31] <+drop_table_subs> The funniest thing is when snipers have the same name in game and in chat
[2022-12-16 23:12:45] <Haenw_> Finley maybe?
[2022-12-16 23:12:48] <@%lass_leah> What about Renathal? He's just a 3/4 nohandsKappa

[2022-12-16 23:17:15] <%vodkatastrophe> @wezaripoto I recommend selling them as NFTs on the open market, quickly leveraging your newly acquired cryptocurrency into buying gold bullion, which will likely be the most valuable when our culture short term falls to pieces. During the collapse, I recommend trading the gold for water, which in the longer run will be more valuable
[2022-12-16 23:17:20] <%vodkatastrophe> Just my 2 cents tho
[2022-12-16 23:17:20] <%+ucdchris1> does he think he playing control priest aswell lol
[2022-12-16 23:17:29] <%rexmkh> @NoHandsGamer get ready for a recent opponent would like to be your friend notification after this game

[2022-12-16 23:18:38] <%vodkatastrophe> @wezaripoto you gotta get those weirdo gold and silver collectors in the infancy of the collapse, when they think gold is more valuable
[2022-12-16 23:18:41] <%Arkarku> heathstone needs a total turn time limit like chess, thoughts?

[2022-12-16 23:21:47] <+Onyrius> !quest
[2022-12-16 23:21:47] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.
[2022-12-16 23:21:50] <Lyconik> priest mirror roping ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-16 23:23:23] <AnacondaHL> KEKL
[2022-12-16 23:23:31] <%+ucdchris1> it runs nerubian vizier probably
[2022-12-16 23:23:34] <SadLH> I think I hear a rope..
[2022-12-16 23:23:38] <%+Razorbam> bon app√©tit!
[2022-12-16 23:23:38] <%+ucdchris1> cause of the skeletons
[2022-12-16 23:23:46] <@%lass_leah> Ping mage doesn't even find room for an Astalor 1-off huh?
[2022-12-16 23:23:52] <twissdumars> No dk decks?? That bad huh?
[2022-12-16 23:23:59] <@%lass_leah> Yeah DK is unplayable
[2022-12-16 23:24:07] <yhcho927000> where is dh huh
[2022-12-16 23:24:12] <%culleexus> can you look at 30 card vs 40 card anub druid`?
[2022-12-16 23:24:12] <rodrik_harlaw> u have to do smth on your turn - otherwise you won't make him wait
[2022-12-16 23:24:20] <%WezaRipoto> there have been some frost DK streams tho
[2022-12-16 23:24:22] <grimBleeper> what's enrage warrior like? i assume it didn't have enough data on vs
[2022-12-16 23:24:23] <Yaya_> Objection seems like it'd be very good against DH where the only minions they run are win conditions
[2022-12-16 23:24:24] <paradoxymorphone> Why are you on the other side of the screen? Is this like parting your hair on the other side to see if people notice? 4Head
[2022-12-16 23:24:25] <%WezaRipoto> it seems ok
[2022-12-16 23:24:32] <+alankordas> nobody wins when we rope
[2022-12-16 23:24:50] <dalitzking> mabey control warrior Is gonna get unnerfed COPIUM
[2022-12-16 23:24:57] <@%lass_leah> but it's not the new fun Mage cards Sadge
[2022-12-16 23:24:57] <+jeffpmerc> I always fight rope with rope, so petty
[2022-12-16 23:24:58] <%WezaRipoto> @NoHandsGamer any way to filter multiple decks of the same archetype?
[2022-12-16 23:25:02] <%+ucdchris1> meta was way to fast for mage cause of aggro so makes sense that the greed control let's mage shine
[2022-12-16 23:25:08] <%rexmkh> the ghoul version can be really inconsistent
[2022-12-16 23:25:11] <%vodkatastrophe> Jambore‚Äôs deck is fun as hell
[2022-12-16 23:25:15] <@%lass_leah> Maybe the set legendary for Mage costing 9 mana isn't a good idea
[2022-12-16 23:25:32] <dalitzking> is minelock doing well or no data ?
[2022-12-16 23:25:35] <prabh23> @dalitzking No blizzard confirmed rogue is op so warrior will be getting nerfed in case rogue steals their cards
[2022-12-16 23:25:37] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> nohands saving everyone $5 on hsreplay SeemsGood
[2022-12-16 23:25:42] <%rexmkh> @lass_leah maybe mage will get a way to discount it later on
[2022-12-16 23:25:52] <+wownickwow> have you looked at habugabu's quest priest yet? it looks cool
[2022-12-16 23:26:10] <z_whitte> the watchpost one
[2022-12-16 23:26:14] <@%lass_leah> @rexmkh hopefully HOPIUM
[2022-12-16 23:26:14] <%JonsyBones> Is the match over yet?

[2022-12-16 23:27:55] <@%lass_leah> @prabh23 who?
[2022-12-16 23:28:14] <gravitas3k> does warrior even exist in the top 100 decks?
[2022-12-16 23:28:17] <SadLH> are we maximizing out xp right now? ..the opponent will definitely NEVER LEARN DansGame just kill him
[2022-12-16 23:28:20] <+helix_sky> KILL KILL KILL

[2022-12-16 23:54:38] <sitruuna__> but it will waste a lot of time
[2022-12-16 23:54:39] <guygosh> legit not worth it, he should insta conede after you clear his board

I can't use a keyboard and mouse without severe pain. Luckily, I discovered hands-free technology as a way to control my computer. I may have the slowest APM in the business. My disability doesn't hold me back in hearthstone, though it may create some amusing moments when I can't click fast enough."2020 update: !nohandsbetter
[2022-12-16 23:57:38] <CheckersCat> i can't believe they banned the eggs. i guess someone there has a brain after all

[2022-12-16 23:57:42] <@^Nightbot> Hands have been doing really well lately. Started doing using new pain management strategies in June of 2019 and have been doing really well. Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.
