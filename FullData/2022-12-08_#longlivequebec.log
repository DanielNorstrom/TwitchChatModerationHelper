[2022-12-08 16:58:24] <Firehawk894> I wonder how long it took for a mod to be made for this game that adds female knights into the game
[2022-12-08 16:58:35] <%+Chaoselements> tis an ideal trait for an interceptor
[2022-12-08 16:58:42] <%AlphaPrimaris> Haven’t heard of any mods for this, actually
[2022-12-08 16:59:25] <ArfurFaulkesHake> @LongLiveQuebec  are you planing to look into Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader?
[2022-12-08 16:59:25] <@^Moobot> Remember to read the rules below the stream to avoid a *bonk* from the mods.
[2022-12-08 16:59:43] <%AlphaPrimaris> We’ll need some extra space for the Knights as well

[2022-12-08 16:59:53] <%AikumaMatata> Is there a meta for these types of games or is there too much rng?
[2022-12-08 17:00:13] <%infernalhaddock> i think there should be a mod to change the halberds to large rubber chickens
[2022-12-08 17:00:16] <Firehawk894> If a Quebec stream doesn't contain multiple mistakes, is it really a Quebec stream?
[2022-12-08 17:00:16] <%AlphaPrimaris> @aikumamatata only RNG in this is loot and mission placement

[2022-12-08 17:55:29] <+L0g1st1cs_Man> So how does one reduce the warp? Is there something a Player can do?
[2022-12-08 17:55:58] <grish199> I think thats all what would fit
[2022-12-08 17:56:08] <%HerraSG> @HerraSG well it's related since they have a fully functional cash shop before the promised crafting system is implemented. Less miffed about the missing weapons since are slightly more justifiable in free patches
[2022-12-08 17:56:13] <%thebigdaddyking4536> @grish199 if a skin shop is fomo damn do i feel bad for you
[2022-12-08 17:56:32] <grish199> @grish199 do you know what fomo means?

[2022-12-08 17:57:20] <%thebigdaddyking4536> @grish199 course i do "fear of missing out" still only applies if it's gone forever after the timer which i highly suspect is not the case

[2022-12-08 17:58:54] <%HerraSG> @thebigdaddyking4536 even if it's not permanently gone after the timer it still plays into it WITH the timer. So I guess a certain level of transparency on how the system will work could help with that

[2022-12-08 19:33:01] <DarkShadowRogue> We're playing Daemonhunters, not Space Hulk! Avoid the wreckage!
[2022-12-08 19:33:02] <+stuckhedgehog> Is there even a bonus for shooting it?
[2022-12-08 19:33:03] <+Multidark14> Avoid
[2022-12-08 19:33:10] <babygrogu11> Avoid
[2022-12-08 19:33:15] <PaalRyd> Just "destroy" a spacehulk? wow what firepower do they wield?
[2022-12-08 19:33:52] <Ookami_Tez> The average amount. Enough to make a planet uninhabitable most likely : D
[2022-12-08 19:33:57] <%Nosebleed_Inc> @paalryd I think it'd be more chipping off some possibly goodies
[2022-12-08 19:34:05] <PaalRyd> ikr?

[2022-12-08 20:02:36] <Firehawk894> The marines in Terminator Armour look huge, but how big are the "small" marines in power armour?

[2022-12-08 20:02:55] <%Nosebleed_Inc> 9 feet ish?
[2022-12-08 20:03:00] <Ledgnairr> They are around 8-9 feet tall
[2022-12-08 20:03:05] <Ookami_Tez> @Firehawk894 Debatable I think but in Armor 8-10 feet
[2022-12-08 20:03:08] VIEWERS: 588
[2022-12-08 20:03:17] <Firehawk894> Marines in the Power Armour are 8 feet+, right?
[2022-12-08 20:03:29] <Ledgnairr> Indeed indeed
[2022-12-08 20:03:46] <Ookami_Tez> I don't think it has ever been clearly said how big they are (also depends on which Marines I think but now we are just splitting hairs)

[2022-12-08 20:04:01] <Ledgnairr> They are not 'human' being turned into a hefty mutation of super soldier
[2022-12-08 20:04:18] <Ookami_Tez> My idea is they are without armor probably 8 to 8½ then Armor gives around a feet to that probably.

[2022-12-08 20:06:54] <%AlexMcFacepalm> because i may miss the next stream if your streaming this tomorrow
[2022-12-08 20:07:03] <Ookami_Tez> @Firehawk894 Did little googling. Few sources say they are only around 7+ feet without armor. But yeah the info is pretty spread out and even if it is canon it can change between writers.
