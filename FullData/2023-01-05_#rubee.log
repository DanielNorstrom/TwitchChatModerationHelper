[2023-01-05 12:32:05] <casualxfs> Silent Hill origins are interesting. Basically there was a bunch of people that were supposed to get rid of and were placed together with no concrete task just to fire them after some time for doing nothing. Since they could do whatever they wanted without executive restrictions instead of getting fired they created Konamis no 1 franchise.
[2023-01-05 12:32:06] <Im_Not_a_Pacifist> the full experience :O
