[2023-01-08 15:31:22] <Ve1amont> totally not poked away from the lane or just die to burst due to 0 hard cc

[2023-01-08 15:32:23] <+oberst3iner> @CookieLoLxx the dependency on support makes it sometimes weak

[2023-01-08 15:34:01] <+Vargas64825> Cheer100 champs are not weak but we are so underleveled like how can a top laner be 3 lvls ahead of me it is unplayable, I need to have 3 kills on me go even try to fight him
[2023-01-08 15:34:03] <+chickg_> what makes zeri so good?

[2023-01-08 15:34:30] <%+YeetusCritus> In my opinion adc isnt a weak role but other roles need so much less mechanics then adc to play the game.

[2023-01-08 15:36:46] <$Vargas64825> Cheer100 I think they need to revert the xp nerf to botlane, and the game would be fine, and what I do find unfair is that a tank can run at u and auto for 500 dmg like what is that

[2023-01-08 15:59:13] <blackobelisk1337> jhin is lethality supp, the hp + armor from randuins would be enough
[2023-01-08 15:59:15] <+mathias_221> @Leo_97531 and he is lethality, so yeah armor counters his dmg alot LUL
[2023-01-08 15:59:20] <not_faizan> is zeri good against tanks?
[2023-01-08 15:59:25] <z7722z> hey cookie waht time is the podcast later, I want to watch it but need to do some stuff in between
[2023-01-08 15:59:29] <$Leo_97531> even when he goes lethality he still relies on 4th auto to work in tandem with the lethality
[2023-01-08 15:59:39] <$Leo_97531> so them building armor already counters the lethality heavy

[2023-01-08 16:04:23] <%+DistantDk> Always feel like zeri games are extrtemely boring
[2023-01-08 16:04:32] <CaseyBeastt> irelia build is legit pepega... ionian boots and no DD

[2023-01-08 17:02:04] <Gravity119> Ashe crits dont do more damage, instead she does 110% bonus damage to enemies affected by her slow, this goes up by 0.75% per 1% crit chance she has, and when she builds IE it goes up to +1.1% per 1% crit

[2023-01-08 17:22:36] <+LogicJonez> Riot has already made it obvious that they Focus for NA is now Valorant. Shooters do better in America.   Lol Player base in NA is like 30 Million or something with only 1.9 doing ranked games most play normal.   Korea has like quad that amount of players.

[2023-01-08 18:32:41] <xrecurve> @CookieLoLxx When do you use other gun rotations than the standard green, purple, blue, red, white
[2023-01-08 18:32:42] <enaye321> do you think zeri is too support dependant to succeed?
[2023-01-08 18:32:43] <enzolags> When is Syndra ADC good?
[2023-01-08 18:32:45] <%SL0VE_> @CookieLoLxx what is the hardest thing for low elo players to learn that you believe would heavily impact their games?
[2023-01-08 18:32:46] <slaughter78788> I think you didnt answer the guy's question. He meant what exactly is his strength when learned.
[2023-01-08 18:32:50] <derrikkk> what pro adc player u think is the best rn ? @CookieLoLxx
[2023-01-08 18:32:53] <Gravity119> What are your opinions on riot adding crit scalings to a bunch of ADC champs lately? I personally would like to kiss the rioter who came up with this on the lips
[2023-01-08 18:32:54] <fortyxshaco> is it an apartment or house ?

[2023-01-08 18:35:17] <lordnoob_> anti healing is just so shit
[2023-01-08 18:35:17] <dragonodys1> antiheal is the biggest bait
[2023-01-08 18:35:17] <ayvee_ez> 2
[2023-01-08 18:35:17] <$misourfluffyface> They’re down 3-4 levels tho

[2023-01-08 18:35:33] <Danielx4013> 1
[2023-01-08 18:35:33] <AngelCrystalCrown> there is a reason why antiheal items are being changed so that they are better
[2023-01-08 18:35:35] <$misourfluffyface> I don’t think healing needs nerfed I think GW needs buffed
[2023-01-08 18:35:39] <ozerblud> 60%
[2023-01-08 18:35:39] <ArtAgma> @CookieLoLxx support have 60%
[2023-01-08 18:35:40] <srbot0n> Just add up to 60% already
[2023-01-08 18:35:43] <boopy_boopster> they should put 40% reduction on a random spell on every champ
[2023-01-08 18:35:43] <YamiCorvus> the problem is healing is based of dmg dealt, theres insane amounts of dmg in the game
[2023-01-08 18:35:45] <ayvee_ez> tank meta RAGEY
[2023-01-08 18:35:45] <fred__chan> buff anti heal a bit and nerf healing a tiny bit
[2023-01-08 18:35:47] <lolmatethisgame> can i sub to your patreon without having paypal/credit card?

[2023-01-08 18:35:48] <+poopydew> drain tank makes no sense because you can build high damage which translates to high tankiness so you get both
[2023-01-08 18:35:50] <andrew5s> But that clip is perfectly "balanced" bc aatrox was 2-3 levels ahead and who knows how many items
[2023-01-08 18:35:50] <Gravity119> only the support one isnt complete utter shit
[2023-01-08 18:35:50] <bda_gammel> Only time antiheal works is rammus
[2023-01-08 18:35:54] <+L0rdSkull_tv> if anti heal iteems suck then liandry sucks i guess
[2023-01-08 18:35:56] <RagnarLothbrock__> exactly, antiheal  It is very weak
[2023-01-08 18:35:57] <%Faramir1993> silver go on silver

[2023-01-08 18:58:05] <re4s_as> nami e damage is overtuned and lucian also gets bonus dmg with his passive
[2023-01-08 18:58:10] <nocika> w8 whats that item on second slot?
[2023-01-08 18:58:12] <Lamprinca> @CookieLoLxx  is it worth selling cull when its out?
[2023-01-08 18:58:17] <%Faramir1993> everyone paying with this new fucking item Jax`s Protein
[2023-01-08 18:58:23] <%Faramir1993> it`s so fucking OP
[2023-01-08 18:58:26] <%Novlol> @Lamprinca only when you need the slot
[2023-01-08 18:58:31] <bdiskabs> @nocika cull
[2023-01-08 18:58:32] <a_blackbird> @mams__ I agree lucian is unplayable if your sup don't pick nami. sub 50% winrate its stupid.
[2023-01-08 18:58:42] <Lamprinca> @Novlol ok ty
[2023-01-08 18:58:46] <%+jeej___> @Faramir1993 when you get something with the gold you get for selling it yes
[2023-01-08 18:58:49] <nocika> what item doing? @bdiskabs
[2023-01-08 18:58:58] <Pedrololo83> why did u go varus ad? i just entered the stream
[2023-01-08 18:59:18] <re4s_as> Lucian nami sucks to lane against so much. Like just play passive for 20 minutes bro otherwise they can engage from 1000 units away and oneshot you
[2023-01-08 18:59:19] <@T1mbits> @Lamprinca when you can either buy an important component by selling it, completing an item, or for slot ONLY if you're buying something for more than the value of the cull. aka dont sell it for a longsword
[2023-01-08 18:59:22] <juanfreire_> hey cookie <3
