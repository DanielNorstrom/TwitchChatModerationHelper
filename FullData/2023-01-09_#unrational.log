[2023-01-09 01:28:23] <+Padraig_Pearse_1916> Nope. They're not replaying it.
[2023-01-09 01:28:23] <@%terpyterpterps> it fucked us bengals over, but doesnt matter, damars health more important
[2023-01-09 01:28:35] <%dotwerdna> if bills or bengals make it to AFC championship, they’ll play it at a neutral site

[2023-01-09 01:28:56] <%dotwerdna> bengals ravens game is a coin flip for home field too no?
[2023-01-09 01:29:03] <@%terpyterpterps> it fucked fantasy too, but most commisioners of leagues just used the bills/bengals players score from this week for fantasy points of last week
[2023-01-09 01:29:10] <%+foolishburrito> I just worked the broadcast of the Bills game here in Buffalo.  Crazy scene today.
[2023-01-09 01:29:12] <@%terpyterpterps> @dotwerdna nope, we won so we get home field
[2023-01-09 01:29:20] <+f00gonewild> every single league is handling the outcome of that situation differently.   In my fantasy league, the finals were so close that we ended up calling it a tie.   Some leagues went with whatever the final score was when the season ended
[2023-01-09 01:29:20] <@%terpyterpterps> if ravens won it woulda been a coin flip
[2023-01-09 01:29:21] <%dotwerdna> ah thats what it was
