[2022-12-22 08:48:41] <%+ky0mu81> 1440p only looks good with little motion as soons as a lot is going on it looks worse than 1080 imo

[2022-12-22 08:49:59] <jscarfac3> little fuzzy
[2022-12-22 08:50:01] <%sherwin_fernandes> what is bitrate
[2022-12-22 08:50:05] <%Friedolf> doesn't really go above 7000, a bit low for 1440
[2022-12-22 08:50:06] <jscarfac3> but good
[2022-12-22 08:50:07] <%Pocketkos> Oh yeah actually getting pixelated
[2022-12-22 08:50:08] <Simo0399> Bit fuzzy
[2022-12-22 08:50:09] <deadlysilence57> 1080p with higher bitrate might be better (if thats a thing)
[2022-12-22 08:50:09] <+shakenbakeow> looks very pixelated

[2022-12-22 08:50:16] <Zeirem> hmm, it is getting fuzzy
[2022-12-22 08:50:18] <%MellowzTV> yeah looks like its starting to artifact more and more for me as you go
[2022-12-22 08:50:20] <sonixka01> pretty fuzzy but i have trash internet
[2022-12-22 08:50:22] <%+ky0mu81> okish but blocky
[2022-12-22 08:50:22] <%+TheWormerine> It Looks good to me- i have fiber internet
[2022-12-22 08:50:24] <@%+daisy82078> That is looks really clean.
[2022-12-22 08:50:41] <%Friedolf> our internet doesn't matter if you are streaming 7000
[2022-12-22 08:50:56] <%MellowzTV> I have 100mb and this is only used 10mb
[2022-12-22 08:50:57] <%Pocketkos> 80 Mb/s average dl should be enough
[2022-12-22 08:51:00] <ArcevFPS> My bandwidth isnt a issue since I push like 150+ mbps
[2022-12-22 08:51:00] <s7bika> quality drops, sometimes 1440P and sometimes not
[2022-12-22 08:51:04] <ArcevFPS> and its pixelated for me
[2022-12-22 08:51:07] <%Haravex> I'm on mobile WiFi and your stream looks fineb
[2022-12-22 08:51:07] <+GelatinousBooze> I have fiber optics har connection and its still a little pixelated but its not unwatchable
[2022-12-22 08:51:25] <DameNightmare> nice bob
[2022-12-22 08:51:31] <%MellowzTV> when it clears up, it looks great, but more than 30s of high motion it gets pretty artifacted
[2022-12-22 08:51:39] <Zeirem> I got 450+ mbps right now
[2022-12-22 08:51:48] <Simo0399> If you have 7k max bitrate it's not enough for 1440p, my internet is doing fine with bouts of constant 32 Mbp/s (twitch usage, it goes up to 80 if needed)

[2022-12-22 08:54:23] <Zeirem> it seems like twitch might throttling
[2022-12-22 08:54:25] <ArcevFPS> Ingest issue
[2022-12-22 08:54:27] <%MellowzTV> yeah look at winston profile pic bottom left, gets super blurry
[2022-12-22 08:54:29] <+MissBunni__> I don't think twitch gives enough bitrate for 1440p
[2022-12-22 08:54:30] <KiraisGod> the bitrate on twitch is 2 low for 1440
[2022-12-22 08:54:30] <%MellowzTV> its all bitrate yeah
[2022-12-22 08:54:35] <Sadfthadsf> yeah 7k bitrate isn't enough
[2022-12-22 08:54:38] <%jehdyeFPS> twitch can't handle 1440p with its max bitrate
[2022-12-22 08:54:43] <%Friedolf> higher bitrate is only on youtube and nobody wants to go there, their chat sucks
[2022-12-22 08:54:50] <%+BlackNite82> Yeah cant fit enough on 1440p with 7k
[2022-12-22 08:54:59] <%MellowzTV> @iddqd how easily can you swap between 1080 and 1440? coz 1440 for slow games is really nice
[2022-12-22 08:54:59] <%+ixmonkix> NO
[2022-12-22 08:54:59] <%+BlackNite82> once it gets busy its too much

[2022-12-22 08:56:09] <ArcevFPS> in reality, 1080p 12mbps is ideal for the best fidelity, however Twitch would break if they allowed that

[2022-12-22 08:58:45] <%+Yagobosuh> isnt video encoding done by 8 bits? so if its not divisible by 8 there might be artifacting

[2022-12-22 09:06:22] <resetNTC> @daisy82078 hey i know iddqd said high plats, but i have something very interesting here, high diamond over 40 elims and 20k+ damage and i lost, was a overtime game you think this one could help not only me but somebody, it was like details thing
[2022-12-22 09:06:36] <%MellowzTV> @iddqd the lower resolution lets you push much higher framerates, even if your CPU has plenty of headroom, if it cant serve frames fast enough to the GPU then you will have lower GPU usage. Higher resolution puts more stress on the GPU making it easier for the CPU to keep up with the number of frames needing to be served
[2022-12-22 09:06:39] <+shakenbakeow> the higher resolution goes the more the gpu has to work while cpu load stays steady per frame
[2022-12-22 09:06:55] <cosimoinexile> Which model monitor
[2022-12-22 09:07:09] <@%+daisy82078> @resetNTC Possible cause I think he will be asking for higher or lower later

[2022-12-22 09:09:00] <%+BlackNite82> Basically in some cases yes 1440p can be faster than 1080p depends on the optimization of the app/game. Something like Counter Strike will still get more frames at 1080p than at 1440p due to very specific optimization but at some point the frames that can be renedered are so much it causes a lag in the drivers on discarding the ones not used that a higher resolution can potentially give you a higher framerate

[2022-12-22 09:14:21] <ArcevFPS> YEPP Using more power, more utilization
[2022-12-22 09:14:25] <Clapts> very good
[2022-12-22 09:14:29] <ashura525> its good
[2022-12-22 09:14:29] <%MellowzTV> looks good
[2022-12-22 09:14:30] <tjgalleguillos> 10/10
[2022-12-22 09:14:30] <herppderppp> crisp

[2022-12-22 09:14:45] <%MellowzTV> almost no artifacting
[2022-12-22 09:15:04] <%ItsSpezi> Stream looks absolute Crispy and great,no matter how much movement 10/10
[2022-12-22 09:15:23] <%JinxItov> yeah
[2022-12-22 09:15:27] <KANZ27> yes
[2022-12-22 09:15:27] <ArcevFPS> YEPP
[2022-12-22 09:15:31] <%JinxItov> bigger temps = bigger use
[2022-12-22 09:15:31] <herppderppp> yep
[2022-12-22 09:15:33] <%jehdyeFPS> yup
[2022-12-22 09:15:40] <%urbanned1> NODDERS
[2022-12-22 09:15:40] <%JinxItov> so pump those numbers up!
[2022-12-22 09:15:40] <KANZ27> correct
[2022-12-22 09:15:42] <Salwant> I see Soj, so the quality isn't ideal Kappa
[2022-12-22 09:15:54] <%Friedolf> no longer cpu bound
[2022-12-22 09:15:57] <%+Yagobosuh> holy 45c is chilling
[2022-12-22 09:15:59] <%Llynok> 60 to 75c is okay though, 40s is very comfy graphics card
[2022-12-22 09:16:05] <%urbanned1> @salwant  KEKL
[2022-12-22 09:16:05] <%+Euboxic> yes - something is always a bottleneck, before you were cpu limited
[2022-12-22 09:16:07] <herppderppp> 1080p you are severely cpu bottlenecked, 1440p your gpu have to work more, but I am still fairly certain your cpu is still the bottleneck
[2022-12-22 09:16:11] <%jehdyeFPS> you should also be capable of checking the performance of your gpu in task manager

[2022-12-22 09:16:23] <KANZ27> also around 70C is pretty normal temp for gpu
[2022-12-22 09:16:24] <%MellowzTV> @iddqd your CPU still having headroom doesnt mean it wasnt bottlenecking your GPU, 1080 was too many frames for CPU to serve
[2022-12-22 09:16:39] <Clapts> :o
[2022-12-22 09:16:47] <herppderppp> being cpu bottlenecked is a good thing though
[2022-12-22 09:16:52] <Clapts> that will double your performance probably
[2022-12-22 09:16:57] <herppderppp> typically means least possible input latency
[2022-12-22 09:17:00] <%Sir_Nightwing> I feel that I could barely fit everything into my pc
[2022-12-22 09:17:03] <Salwant> It's too big, daddy? Kappa

[2022-12-22 09:17:07] <Clapts> @herppderppp isn't it called gpu bound

[2022-12-22 09:20:29] <ArcevFPS> I feel deceived, since when you Q up comp, it uses your MMR from QP and the like. Im not a Masters player yet I see Top 500 and Masters in my QP games
[2022-12-22 09:20:37] <%sir_kil_alott> I like sojourns gun it's so cool iddGasm
[2022-12-22 09:20:38] <tsoumbas> @iddqd 1080p will still be the current resolution until the graphic cards reduce their current sales price sudge
[2022-12-22 09:20:48] <ArcevFPS> So there is a bit of hesitation there

[2022-12-22 09:50:26] <darksithey> Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it. The consequences of memory leak is that it reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory.

[2022-12-22 09:53:29] <Augmented_1> Thats a major leak right there, but idk why it happens to you so bad, usually takes me 3 - 4 games
[2022-12-22 09:53:40] <magnoman51> @iddqd its all the noise that the engine has to calculates
[2022-12-22 09:53:44] <Bobolongs> Probably doesn't clear memory from the first match right
[2022-12-22 09:53:44] <+Techii> its all the animation
[2022-12-22 09:53:45] <+philztro> Aye, thats why I' gave AMD a chance in the first place. straight up power they are up there for sure. But I am not impressed imo @DemonStrate86
[2022-12-22 09:53:45] <infinia_atlas> the programmers probably don't understand it either, that is why it isn't fixed :D
[2022-12-22 09:53:49] <Bobolongs> does it get worse next game?

[2022-12-22 09:53:51] <Gllitchy> is it that big of a deal?
[2022-12-22 09:53:55] <Lvngz> @augmented_1 same it drops to 120 ):
[2022-12-22 09:53:56] <%ArtsArts> There was a fight happening, it is normal for it to go down
[2022-12-22 09:54:00] <magnoman51> the more the teams spam their abilities , the engine gets overwhelmed a bit
[2022-12-22 09:54:01] <cosimoinexile> If your monitor is 240hz you should match your fps to that with gsync
[2022-12-22 09:54:05] <%+Euboxic> do you have dynamic render scale enabled?
[2022-12-22 09:54:07] <%DemonStrate86> I'm extremely tech saavy, but I tech is so complex that you can't know exactly.
[2022-12-22 09:54:09] <%+alternatecrabby> Maybe its because of uneven resource sharing for your stream and game
[2022-12-22 09:54:09] <%Llynok> wait why wouldn't it go down during a fight? more stuff is happening and needs to be drawn

[2022-12-22 09:55:12] <%DemonStrate86> @cosimoinexile He likely doesn't use gsync. No real point above a certain FPS because you can't perceive screen tearing.

[2022-12-22 10:05:20] <%+JustJammer> KarQ brought out a pretty extensive guide 2 weeks ago on how optimize the settings.. maybe there's something in there that helps
[2022-12-22 10:05:21] <+DjPabu> Its probably true. Diablo 3 was unplayable for me and blizzard said it was my pc. Lo and behold, a patch later everything was smooth again. Same pc :)

[2022-12-22 10:05:31] <ArcevFPS> Try to disable a OS setting called High Precision Event Timer, its known to decrease frame times. Its not going to fix the game itself but its a overall general optimization

[2022-12-22 10:17:13] <talon824> I feel like there‚Äôs no way to actually ‚Äúbalance‚Äù Overwatch without certain heroes like Widow being either OPAF or unplayable, and heroes like Hog getting full reworks
[2022-12-22 10:17:18] <Meek1232> As long as Blizz gets the $$$ they won't mind LUL
[2022-12-22 10:17:29] <sTraTni> even when I was kind of try hard on PC, it was always CSGO for actually trying and OW after to chill out and laugh our asses off ü§∑
[2022-12-22 10:17:30] <ZormiK> I wonder if blizz acquisition by microsoft will change anything for ow2 Hmm
[2022-12-22 10:17:43] <%Mr_Elvis_Presley> The casuals are the younger kids that take mami and daddy credit card to buy the skins, makes more money for blizzard that way they smart
[2022-12-22 10:17:58] <sTraTni> now I'm just a console pleb LUL
[2022-12-22 10:18:17] <SnoozyPS4> whats does ow need then inorder to be competitive again?
[2022-12-22 10:18:22] <+Zyrkha> Hello dude, i love the educational aspect you give. Where, why or how do you pick cree or why you should chose cree please?
[2022-12-22 10:18:25] <Meek1232> What I hate about the BP system is it's the season that it themed and BP gets 1 or 2 themed skin
[2022-12-22 10:18:30] <rambomode666> hero never die, dies
[2022-12-22 10:18:41] <Meek1232> And some random shit

[2022-12-22 10:19:17] <+AGirlCalledJim> @Verlei97 What's a wooting keyboard?
[2022-12-22 10:19:25] <Meek1232> I thought that heroes are core to the game
[2022-12-22 10:19:31] <SnoozyPS4> do you think thats why rank is messed up and inflated
[2022-12-22 10:19:33] <Zeirem> wait, what character costs money?
[2022-12-22 10:19:39] <JORGE__Ow> it just hurts because i think the most fun ive had playing this game was tryhard stacking in comp and playing in low tier teams
[2022-12-22 10:19:42] <Hengeballe> But will the heroes be free when there is a new season?
[2022-12-22 10:19:49] <ArcevFPS> Apex is a whole different genre of game and its more competitive then OW2 rn
[2022-12-22 10:19:58] <kobraaas> nah kiriko is too strong for it to be comp
[2022-12-22 10:20:00] <%+mademedothis_> kiriko was free
[2022-12-22 10:20:03] <okjadoll> if u want to get ramatra instantly u have to buy the battlepass
[2022-12-22 10:20:03] <ExiledIsHappy> do people have to buy kiriko?????
[2022-12-22 10:20:06] <immortalfrost_> @AGirlCalledJim its an analog input keyboard, one of the best gaming keebs available rn
[2022-12-22 10:20:09] <%arcturus12d> I thought you could do challenges
[2022-12-22 10:20:09] <okjadoll> but u can get them for free in the battlepass
[2022-12-22 10:20:12] <Meek1232> Kiriko was free for OW 1 players
[2022-12-22 10:20:12] <+AGirlCalledJim> @Zeirem All the new OW2 ones
[2022-12-22 10:20:14] <%Mokho> Honestly comparing the ppl I used to get in my Comp games in Season 1 and now...oof the gap in basic skills
[2022-12-22 10:20:17] <%Reifuu> Each character can be obtained for free.
[2022-12-22 10:20:18] <herppderppp> ackzhually you can get them for free if you  just play the game for like 500 hours KEKW
[2022-12-22 10:20:20] <talon824> @meek1232 You mean like how we got ‚ÄúGreek mythology‚Äù BP, and they gave us Starving Child Tracer in the BP and only 3 themed skins in the bp
[2022-12-22 10:20:21] <Ligh1_1> @Hengeballe not having broken hero for season seems fine to me Clueless
[2022-12-22 10:20:21] <LiterallyJustAnOlive> Kirikio was only free for ow1 players
[2022-12-22 10:20:27] <Zeirem> hmm
[2022-12-22 10:20:28] <%+firmstool> I haven't unlocked kiriko and ramatra. I thought the kiriko challenges were trivial if you play support, no?
[2022-12-22 10:20:30] <%Reifuu> @Zeirem Can be obtained for free too
[2022-12-22 10:20:33] <+lostnconfused_> I think people who had ow1 are forgetting that not everyone got her for free
[2022-12-22 10:20:35] <Meek1232> @talon824 Yeah KEKW
[2022-12-22 10:20:38] <ZormiK> kiriko was free but locked behind 55 levels of bp, so you are paying with your time essentialy
[2022-12-22 10:20:41] <Meek1232> @talon824 I hate it

[2022-12-22 10:21:15] <JORGE__Ow> i never looked into it, but if you dont get to the tier to unluck a hero, is it just not unlockable forever?
[2022-12-22 10:21:26] <Meek1232> Sojourn's gun feels so good to use
[2022-12-22 10:21:38] <%Reifuu> @JORGE__Ow It can be unlocked through challenges, or money
[2022-12-22 10:21:44] <Zeirem> yeah, she is what 76 wish he was
[2022-12-22 10:21:45] <+AGirlCalledJim> @JORGE__Ow there are challenges, or you can buy them
[2022-12-22 10:21:49] <talon824> @jorge__ow If you miss a hero, they get added to the ‚Äúhero‚Äù challenges page
[2022-12-22 10:21:50] <LiterallyJustAnOlive> You can still unlock the heroes after the season through challanges
[2022-12-22 10:22:11] <Augmented_1> Proj does 0 dmg, rail buffed to 500 dmg KEKW
[2022-12-22 10:22:16] <Zeirem> The railgun is too cool though
[2022-12-22 10:22:16] <JORGE__Ow> lol
[2022-12-22 10:22:17] <dabeeestkuhehehe> I just tried her today and was so confused why I couldn't hit when I'm normally OK on soldier. Didn't know primary was projectile
[2022-12-22 10:22:25] <+CentaurAsh> the Mercy is hilarious
[2022-12-22 10:22:26] <%crocodile69420> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-22 10:22:29] <Meek1232> To me every hero should just be released like in OW 1 no challenges or BP grind or whatever
[2022-12-22 10:22:30] <Zeirem> railgun is the unique part of her i think
[2022-12-22 10:22:32] <ralfone> i feel the same about her
[2022-12-22 10:22:34] <ZormiK> I find the projectile/hitscan combo weird to play :/

[2022-12-22 13:24:35] <44plus3> yo 1 question as a new player to ow how do you play around a tank who isn't makin any space and you as a dps whos trying to get pick but also getting all the attention which is just making it harder
[2022-12-22 13:24:37] <%sherwin_fernandes> Her drop off increased from 10 to 25m
[2022-12-22 13:24:42] <+bittlegut> will blizz ever be able to balance things to a point where theres no meta?
[2022-12-22 13:24:44] <%ElGatoMatador> yeah but if you stop for half second its recharged but yea technically its not infinite
[2022-12-22 13:24:49] <%ashura525> it would be perfectly fine if her ult change to slow overtime instead damaging, like mei ult but instead just slow debuff

[2022-12-22 15:12:44] <%$de4dhe4d> not really
[2022-12-22 15:12:50] <m_h_b_94> no
[2022-12-22 15:12:52] <TheOriginalPuka> one thing i‚Äôd say about the Baptiste gameplay would be to be charging boots preemptively more often, so when the Genji was diving on him he could immediately jump out rather than possibly dying in the second it takes to charge boots
[2022-12-22 15:12:53] <dendercee> @TopLeftGuy Same
[2022-12-22 15:12:57] <%+Joe__Blast> Its weird that im damaging too much on bap and healing too much on moria

[2022-12-22 16:00:50] <44plus3> yo id 1 question as a new player to ow how do you play around a tank who isn't makin any space and you as a dps whos trying to get pick but also getting all the attention which is just making it harder
[2022-12-22 16:01:14] <MrSpeedrun> idk about high plat but i think maybe gold just with better positioning, but by the time he hits gold he might have enough experience to hit plat by then

[2022-12-22 16:18:51] ~Stream offline~
[2022-12-22 16:18:57] <+oVates> @MrSpeedrun thanks man, i feel great.. the withdrawal hasnt been as bad as past times either
[2022-12-22 16:18:58] <+AGirlCalledJim> Bye chat
[2022-12-22 16:19:27] <+oVates> @MrSpeedrun don‚Äôt mean to sound corny but i also somewhat found god thru the process and that‚Äôs inspiring me tremendously
[2022-12-22 16:19:39] <MrSpeedrun> @oVates keep in mind, youll feel the full positive effects (better memory, less anxiety, higher dopamine baseline) after 3 months so its only gonna get better with every week that goes!
[2022-12-22 16:20:49] <MrSpeedrun> @oVates that sounds very good, giving yourself to a higher power is very powerful and if thats a god or god himself for you that is absolutely fine
[2022-12-22 16:21:04] <+oVates> @MrSpeedrun for sure, ive heard after the first month it gets a lot easier too, so im looking forward to that "checkpoint" as well lol
[2022-12-22 16:21:54] <+oVates> @MrSpeedrun it just helps me to feel like i cant waste my life you know? for myself, those i love, and the greater script of life so to say.. i have a role to play -- i cant just be passive u know?
[2022-12-22 16:22:13] <MrSpeedrun> @oVates thats exactly right
[2022-12-22 16:22:18] <MrSpeedrun> that is the worst part about weed
[2022-12-22 16:22:29] <MrSpeedrun> and it DOES mess you up
[2022-12-22 16:22:35] <+oVates> for real man... it causes u to wither away
[2022-12-22 16:22:36] <MrSpeedrun> i literally speak from experience
[2022-12-22 16:22:48] <MrSpeedrun> i lost 2 jobs cause of weed literally
[2022-12-22 16:22:57] <MrSpeedrun> and my grades in school dropped
[2022-12-22 16:23:17] <+oVates> same man :/ i dropped out of college and have had a really hard time holding jobs
[2022-12-22 16:23:21] <MrSpeedrun> like its no doubt in my mind at least for me that it does mess with my memory to some extend for sure

[2022-12-22 16:23:31] <+oVates> probably gonna go back to school soon
[2022-12-22 16:23:38] <+oVates> absolutely
[2022-12-22 16:24:04] <MrSpeedrun> @oVates you should its the perfect time to stop too, if school starts in summer and you stop now youll feel a significant improvement promise
[2022-12-22 16:24:39] <MrSpeedrun> the good thing is its not like alcohol
[2022-12-22 16:24:50] <MrSpeedrun> it doesnt permanently or for years impair your memory
[2022-12-22 16:25:14] <+oVates> for sure, that‚Äôs so true w the 3 month thing u mentioned... im really looking forward to doing womething w my life man
[2022-12-22 16:25:15] <MrSpeedrun> but it takes MONTHS to fully recover and people underestimate it, its what makes weed pretty dangerous job/school wise
[2022-12-22 16:25:35] <+oVates> right -- i already feel my memory and my intellect coming back so much and its only been a week
[2022-12-22 16:25:36] <MrSpeedrun> the best part is that it makes you much more social aswell
[2022-12-22 16:25:53] <MrSpeedrun> i know what you mean :)
[2022-12-22 16:26:01] <+oVates> YES DUDE. i realize so muc hsocial anxiety came from weed .... and i thought it helped
[2022-12-22 16:26:08] <MrSpeedrun> after 1 month youll be much more comfortable around people its amazing :)
[2022-12-22 16:26:29] <MrSpeedrun> i know this cause i smoked for 4 years and it completely changed my life when i stopped
[2022-12-22 16:26:31] <+oVates> that‚Äôs good to hear, im looking forward to it.. im already so much more comfortable in my own skin too
[2022-12-22 16:27:30] <+oVates> yea same man. I went thru something where i moved to a new town and essentially someone slandered me on soical media because I was dating her daughter, which caused a ton of the town to believe that i was dangerous for her
[2022-12-22 16:27:45] <+oVates> her mom is diagnosed w an unkown something, and i don‚Äôt mean to go into detail too much
[2022-12-22 16:27:55] <+oVates> but it caused me to feel like i had to run away
[2022-12-22 16:28:16] <+oVates> im realizing the trauma that caused my addiction, and how it had so much to do w anxiety, but made it worse
[2022-12-22 16:28:20] <MrSpeedrun> this is the perfect time to reverse it, withdrawals make you stronger but thats not to say theyre good for you haha
[2022-12-22 16:28:52] <MrSpeedrun> that makes sence
[2022-12-22 16:29:04] <MrSpeedrun> weed makes the trauma worse cause of the anxiety
[2022-12-22 16:29:12] <+oVates> of course theres more than that, but it goes to show how someone can fall into the pit so to say
[2022-12-22 16:29:17] <+oVates> absoluately
[2022-12-22 16:29:29] <MrSpeedrun> in reality it probably wasnt as bad as you think but stopping may help you al ot internalizing this
[2022-12-22 16:29:40] <+oVates> it causes u to not be able to move on i feel like.. just reliving trauma
[2022-12-22 16:30:01] <+oVates> I wish there was more information out there about how bad weed can be... it can be great for some ppl, but also so dangerous
[2022-12-22 16:30:26] <+oVates> it definitely wasnt as bad as i thought it was -- but the paranoia from the weed made it feel sooo bad
[2022-12-22 16:30:41] <MrSpeedrun> its all cause of the imbalance and weed messes with that
[2022-12-22 16:30:55] <+oVates> definitely.. just not in touch w reality enough
[2022-12-22 16:30:57] <MrSpeedrun> check out cgkid
[2022-12-22 16:31:20] <+oVates> on youtube?
[2022-12-22 16:31:37] <MrSpeedrun> i watched his videos on weed withdrawal and he had much worse drug experiences (even with fucking meth and heroin) and hes so brilliant when it comes to thiss
