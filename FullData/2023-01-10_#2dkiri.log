[2023-01-10 13:33:09] <!%+Wrinxz> Kiri, you've played more Rimworld than me so maybe you know. Is it better to smooth floors and walls or put down tile/block walls?
[2023-01-10 13:33:27] <!%+Wrinxz> Time wise as well as beauty.

[2023-01-10 15:19:55] <$sabeytee> "Forced weather" there is something fishy about the weather. It may be salted rain, which freezes at a much lower temperature.

[2023-01-10 17:50:08] <%duVillage> @2DKiri One more important thing I forgot to mention yesterday: always have cash on you in Japan. Most stores and restaurants only accept cash. ATM's tend to only be open during business hours, so if you run out of cash, you are f***ed.
[2023-01-10 17:50:09] <%Draksis45> kiriHi kiriHi

[2023-01-10 17:54:26] <Chuck420> Black Pink?
[2023-01-10 17:54:26] <+gualdhar> Babymetal?
[2023-01-10 17:54:32] <%duVillage> the style is called gothic lolita
[2023-01-10 17:54:34] <%wittekip_nl> is that not k pop?
[2023-01-10 17:54:39] <%duVillage> I am not a fan of them, although their band is fire
[2023-01-10 17:54:44] <%duVillage> no it is J metal
[2023-01-10 17:54:48] <%AkumiOnBass> there is jpop
[2023-01-10 17:55:01] <%wittekip_nl> not my genre...
[2023-01-10 17:55:01] <wickwrack> I only know Band-Maid
[2023-01-10 17:55:02] <Chuck420> Black pink is K pop I think, i'm the one messing everything

[2023-01-10 17:57:53] <%duVillage> In progressive pop there are things like C√∂ shu Nie, who is a bit like Sia, complex pop songs with strong but weird vocals
[2023-01-10 17:58:00] <Ddog7x3> If I‚Äôm not mistaken theres an Australian wrestler what dresses like a princess and sings metal  in a Japanese idol group and it‚Äôs surprising good music tbh
[2023-01-10 17:58:38] <%duVillage> and famously from Kiri's country
[2023-01-10 17:58:48] <Ddog7x3> Wish i could remember their name
