[2023-01-05 18:19:48] <pybus2> @GingiTV the irony of it all is that it was mostly top guilds asking for group loot over personal

[2023-01-05 18:20:38] <+drymeen30> They need to give us the choice between personal and group loot for raid
[2023-01-05 18:20:41] <+cjoels> group loot is only good when you can council it properly
[2023-01-05 18:20:45] <Slimbo82> it is to make thie game a little more difficault
[2023-01-05 18:20:47] <jeeesp> i can agree
[2023-01-05 18:20:51] <normageqq> literally no one asked for this, people asked for the option of masterloot for guilds, not to change the default of personal loot

[2023-01-05 18:48:39] <+drymeen30> @TheNoMansLands there's no weekly grind outside of cosmetic/crafted stuff so you can start whenever. Won't lie though getting into decent m+ groups always is a hasstle when you don't have io but if you work your way up slowly you can catch up with no issue.
[2023-01-05 18:48:41] <%eYzll> @TheNoMansLands you can farm gear pretty easy. Through the elemental fields on the map you farm currency which you can trade in valdrakken and get gear. You can upgrade this gear to 385
