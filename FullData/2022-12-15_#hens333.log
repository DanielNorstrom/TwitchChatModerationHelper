[2022-12-15 17:25:07] <ColossalDonut5> sweating on dbd is the worst, that's why I love events with stuff like the snowmen or playing meme builds
[2022-12-15 17:25:08] <%+murphyslaw55> true, that's why I steal chase instead of doing gens, more fun YesYes
[2022-12-15 17:25:10] <semyprocargo> Hens is Blood Pact a good perk at all or not ?
[2022-12-15 17:25:11] <%TheRahn> it is game developers' job to prevent players from optimizing the fun out of the game
[2022-12-15 17:25:14] <yuuukiosu> also it's almost the same entire builds when everyone is competitive
[2022-12-15 17:25:17] <BoondockJoker> I feel most games are like that. Once you play like it's reading a spreadsheet the fun is lost
[2022-12-15 17:25:17] <Ferixo> hi chat!

[2022-12-15 17:26:00] <iiLikey> comp never felt balanced since both sides don't play on the same map seed
[2022-12-15 17:26:00] <ColossalDonut5> but for me I also suck at the game so it's much easier for me to get frustrated. I think the better at the game you are the more easy it is to chill in a weird way, at least when on your own.

[2022-12-15 17:26:42] <%Mrs_Rah> @semyprocargo feng has better perks/outfits
[2022-12-15 17:26:49] <grumblephant> Yeah! I need to see the new tree so I can get Snowman Dredge fastest

[2022-12-15 17:26:51] <RedLobos> I think the game is item and map sided
[2022-12-15 17:26:52] <Aoltre> @ferixo congrats! They're pretty difficult because either bad perks or bad power.
[2022-12-15 17:26:52] <maysoncranks3> Guys i think it is a loop

[2022-12-15 17:27:22] <ColossalDonut5> because when you're good you can more easily recognise when it's either your own mistakes or other player strengths and also the less mistakes you make as a player the less frustrated you get

[2022-12-15 17:28:13] <pjboyserg> I 1st started playing this game in 2018 and it was way more survivor sided then and I see killers complaining now

[2022-12-15 17:29:01] <+scoobysnaxzz> game will always be survivor sided with comms Bedge

[2022-12-15 17:30:32] <yuuukiosu> i can make like 5 or 6 meals for the price of 3 mcdonalds menus

[2022-12-15 17:30:49] <+scoobysnaxzz> making changes over the highest skilled players would make the game less enjoyable tho
[2022-12-15 17:30:52] <yuuukiosu> probably even 10 meals if i stretch the costs

[2022-12-15 17:48:49] <twistedf_> @Consumer_Of_Crayons if you play more killer and get mad it also means u prolly dont like losing and there are ways to increase chances to the point of having fun. and if im wrong and u dont care about 4k every game do as i said. 4 aura perks on any killer u like and play for the ride(chases)

[2022-12-15 18:19:08] <Zhinloki> distortion has always been a good perk hasnt it?
[2022-12-15 18:19:14] <Sharky_Girl987> I need to play with the perk more

[2022-12-15 18:19:34] <%Dean_N64> Since the buff I think distortion has always been good, even if you dont get use out of it you learn the killer doesnt have Aura

[2022-12-15 18:50:21] <%+Rocarolla> never seen this mysterious killer before. he's not available in the store or as dlc
[2022-12-15 18:50:29] <ragan8888> @DarthGryffon thats to add the season whatever killer V something?
[2022-12-15 18:50:49] <%+foxtheunicorn> thats some weird blight gameplay right there
[2022-12-15 18:51:10] <JayJ_Legion> what do u think is better on a build deadlock or corrupt?

[2022-12-15 18:51:32] <ragan8888> this map is literally a bamboozle or nurse check
[2022-12-15 18:51:45] <%DarthGryffon> signs point to a second dlc with vecna and a new map, nobody has any idea what survivors or when they plan to release it
[2022-12-15 18:51:58] <ragan8888> Nah bam definitely helps. main building is a joke with Bam
[2022-12-15 18:52:04] <%Chief_Ohnay> just feels a bit of an odd choice, but it's because I'm a STBFL addict on Demo

[2022-12-15 18:52:21] <ragan8888> @Chief_Ohnay stbfl is good on demo
[2022-12-15 18:52:24] <JayJ_Legion> for a m1 killer, corrupt or deadlock, rest of build dm
[2022-12-15 18:52:41] <@%Loni1211> I almost never run glasses but the one game i do feels so great
[2022-12-15 18:53:05] <%DarthGryffon> the best guess is eddie and robin BUT the only info im willing to state is what leakers have confirmed and there is absolutely no existing info on what survivors
[2022-12-15 18:53:05] <%+Rocarolla> leakers be like, demo is coming back. source = trust me bro
[2022-12-15 18:53:13] <ragan8888> @JayJ_Legion trapper and MM definitely are better with corrupt. they hurt so much w/o it
[2022-12-15 18:53:32] <%Kasey_tea> Yeah cooking with leeks aren't for everyone I suppose
[2022-12-15 18:53:35] <@%Loni1211> Leaks are not true most of the time so it isnt worth spending time on the topic+people want to have the suprise factor of some things
[2022-12-15 18:53:41] <%Chief_Ohnay> @Chief_Ohnay @ragan8888 I run it on every M1 killer and sometimes on killers that can M1/M2 options like Demo or Wesker. but with Wesker/Nemmy, it makes you want to M1 instead of M2, which is where you are at your strongest

[2022-12-15 19:33:05] <alert115> @Rocarolla correct answer
[2022-12-15 19:33:24] <%+Scike_> @j0nathangaming that’s mostly just experience, idk if you play killer or not but that helps with knowing what survivors are doing (and thus what a killer would do). But it’s very common to panic after a first hit or when people are downable- try to stay calm and be aware of the loops that are available in the area

[2022-12-15 19:35:01] <j0nathanGaming> @Scike_ I often play more killer than survivor. I have learned a good amount of stuff from the survivors I play against. But I usually have trouble figuring out what the killer is planning to do and often panic and goof up
[2022-12-15 19:35:40] <j0nathanGaming> @Scike_ Also if the killer manages to lose their red stain, I lose all sense of loop knowledge for some unknown reason

[2022-12-15 19:36:20] <%LeSh4ggy> @j0nathangaming basically its Just decision making that comes with experience, the more u play survivor, the better your decision making
[2022-12-15 19:36:37] <j0nathanGaming> @LeSh4ggy seems legit
[2022-12-15 19:36:53] <+peepozay> why would she do that KEKW
[2022-12-15 19:37:02] <%+Scike_> @j0nathangaming yeah not seeing the stain makes it harder for sure haha, but yeah just keep playing and you will mostly get over it. I still panic in certain spots, or with specific killers because they can get very unpredictable.  Glgl

[2022-12-15 20:08:38] <nolifealice> they probably gave up after first kill 5 gens KEKW
[2022-12-15 20:08:44] <ObsidianLiger> @globo12343 yeah I was right under a hook cause he camped my out so there was a hook, and I was on death hook
[2022-12-15 20:09:01] <%+globo12343> @obsidianliger he even had the 4k secured cause everyone was kinda near each other and we were all slugged and UB was used alr

[2022-12-15 20:09:36] <nolifealice> i have this problem too, experienced killer gets matched with bad solo survivors, and they win 90% of the time KEKW
[2022-12-15 20:09:44] <ObsidianLiger> I was gonna give up to give the last player a chance for hatch but he just downed me and the rescuer dc'd @globo12343

[2022-12-15 20:10:27] <lambog96> That little blue dude is cute
[2022-12-15 20:10:29] <nolifealice> @globo12343 i didn't win in like 40 hours not even a pity hatch KEKW

[2022-12-15 20:11:35] <lambog96> Bubba does feel decently strong
[2022-12-15 20:11:41] <lambog96> Low a tier at least
[2022-12-15 20:11:46] <DanyR> @globo12343 6k hour but 20min on Nurse, gets matched with you? Seems fair.
[2022-12-15 20:11:46] <%+globo12343> @nolifealice is the killer rly good or just the team killing you? Sometimes I go up against killers that tend to be mediocre but for some reason some teammates are just playing like babies

[2022-12-15 20:12:35] <%+globo12343> @danyr but on their page it said nurse main. I believe they were a streamer too

[2022-12-15 20:14:53] <ObsidianLiger> @borkbork34 It's okay, 1. this game isn't balanced around swfs, 2. losing is part of the game, 3. you will get better, slowly but surely, it's okay if you lose sometimes, or even most times, what matters is that at the end of the day, you're still loved <3

[2022-12-15 20:15:45] <DanyR> smurf refers to when you make a fresh account to get into lower mmr lobbies. originates from counterstrike

[2022-12-15 20:17:10] <DanyR> @globo12343 that your 300h account has a much higher mmr than should be, as you have 5k hours experience on your main.
[2022-12-15 20:17:57] <%+globo12343> @danyr But I did only have 300 hours KEKW. I barely started playing during the nemesis chapter which was last year and I got matched up against this nurse like a month in
