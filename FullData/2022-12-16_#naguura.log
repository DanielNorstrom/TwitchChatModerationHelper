[2022-12-16 02:57:46] <%Limdaer> I dont like that, because you still have to take 2 ranks, cause you need the talents after KEKW

[2022-12-16 03:01:28] <%Limdaer> @Naguura So whats different about the new talent instead of circle of life and death? You still need rank 2, because you want orbit breaker right?
[2022-12-16 03:01:33] <%WeaselMuffin> did you hate sitting opposite preheat that much

[2022-12-16 05:13:39] <+Malnar1123> I really want to like Boomkin but I constantly feel like I have to refresh dots when I'm wanting to pop off. Maybe it's cause Eclipses make you feel like you're in a CD phase constantly.

[2022-12-16 05:44:34] <+tut0r64> Yeah it felt horrible not being able to ramp at all. Kind of hoping it still excells in higher keys as its an awesome class to play especially in utility
[2022-12-16 05:44:49] <+tut0r64> still not a fan of trying to maintain SF though..
[2022-12-16 05:44:58] <+Gene_Splicer23> Tell Jak he's TOO loud :) lol

[2022-12-16 05:47:17] <%+Luc1dDream> Is the scaling a bug?
[2022-12-16 05:47:30] <+Gene_Splicer23> They woulda hotfixed it by now I'm sure.
[2022-12-16 05:47:34] <@%itsClubby> The idea of it scaling is great for pretty much everyone involved
[2022-12-16 05:47:34] <+Tas022> I love it. Keeps content relevant
[2022-12-16 05:47:35] <streptomyces> I think it's good for the more casual people for sure
[2022-12-16 05:47:35] <%+Luc1dDream> because I think it's pretty great
[2022-12-16 05:47:51] <%soultiedthehunter> it does not scale on Draenor
[2022-12-16 05:48:04] <streptomyces> Cuz it still won't be faster gearing for people doing the raid or high m+
[2022-12-16 05:48:05] <Oscarzulu__> I could see them doing it to keep you doing everything every week
[2022-12-16 05:48:13] <%+GabS_Plays> snowball effect ye
[2022-12-16 05:48:15] <@%itsClubby> What we don't want to happen is a BiS item to be based off a world quest that only appears once a blue moon
[2022-12-16 05:48:20] <%+Luc1dDream> World Quests are worthless after a few weeks unless you're grinding rep
[2022-12-16 05:48:36] <JerBoody> I mean if they don’t scale, world domination quests become irrelevant pretty quickly
[2022-12-16 05:48:36] <streptomyces> I got 3 397 pieces from rares and none of them were useable, so it's not an efficient way to loot.
[2022-12-16 05:49:02] <%soultiedthehunter> @streptomyces totally agree
[2022-12-16 05:49:21] <%+Luc1dDream> I just unlocked WQs, the base iLvl I saw was 340, which was much higher than mine when I started.
[2022-12-16 05:49:25] <streptomyces> I still don't think it's a good way to spend your time if you could otherwise be doing 10s or higher keys
[2022-12-16 05:50:03] <+tpreturnz> yeah if youre trying to min max thats the way to do it for sure
