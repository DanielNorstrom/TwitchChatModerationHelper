[2022-12-09 13:47:46] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @Relyne Easiest way to manage DPM is to treat it like a 2-shot autoloader. Never use the 3rd shell unless you absolutely have to, or you're going to have a long time of doing nothing. Same thing with the Progetto 46, 2-shot autoloader, 3rd shell for emergencies
[2022-12-09 13:48:00] <%freeborn79> @skill4ltu this is in my opinion the worst tank in the game
[2022-12-09 13:48:00] <Chuckle_x> @Relyne You will get used to it very quickly,  my advice would be don't fire your third shell unless you need to.  It just takes too long to reload it so it kills your dpm  :)

[2022-12-09 14:13:52] <tickinclocks> but otherwise t56 is better
[2022-12-09 14:13:55] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @skill4ltu I was arguing on stream that WG should make Tier 11 to fix game balance. Move the best Tier 8 Premiums to Tier 9, that way they're not actually being nerfed. BZ-176, Skoda T56, AMBT, Obj. 703 II - These aren't Tier 8 tanks. They're Tier 9 tanks and should be balanced as such.

[2022-12-09 14:15:28] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @ScorpianyTheGOAT It wouldn't be a nerf if we had Tier 11. That way the balance remains the same. Best Tier 10's become the new Tier 11, etc. And you can always buff Premiums to balance them as needed.

[2022-12-09 15:06:08] <nickpartially> I tried to mark t34 3 these days.. but BZ getting into positions before me and punishing me for half hp feels bad
[2022-12-09 15:06:09] <BambinoMimino> That tank just doesn't belong there like Waffle was, so now we have BZ on VIII tier
[2022-12-09 15:06:11] <Xuecs> nah no way skoda is way better

[2022-12-09 15:58:21] <%+Frigo009> is AMBT play style any similar to Progetto46?
[2022-12-09 15:58:37] <%marsal_ltu> @skill4ltu They should be released tomorrow.
[2022-12-09 15:58:47] <Aradas75> @skill4ltu just got T25/2 and oddly enough it seems to be a decent tank
[2022-12-09 15:58:47] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @Frigo009 Yes, like an armored, brawling version of the Progetto. You're going to be more aggressive with it, but same playstyle.

[2022-12-09 16:12:41] <mercki280> @skill4ltu  despite the gun on BZ, my main issue is that the whole point of heavies is they are slow to positions. Sometimes now I get to strong positions at start of battle slower than enemy BZ just because of rockets ...
[2022-12-09 16:12:48] <GR_Charlieee> I wanna show skill an achievement of mine

[2022-12-09 16:13:04] <+marsitz> i mean wargaming making premium tanks more and more easy to play and on top really really strong frontline (vipera, BZ, iron arnie, etc.) i think they targeting new players who can buy good experiences

[2022-12-09 16:14:15] <stevemaqueen> when you say average player... isnt it really fast or slow computer and frame rates?
[2022-12-09 16:14:18] <GR_Charlieee> I agree, under 100 games is Kreygasm

[2022-12-09 16:15:08] <+xKhaaos> @skill4ltu I had a BZ game with 4.1k dmg and 5 kills and was still 100 xp off of Ace, guess it requires a really good game to ace
[2022-12-09 16:15:10] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @GR_Charlieee Possible, yes, but the tank would have to have low requirements.
