[2022-12-16 20:34:20] <%nevenx> I have this issue, mine starburst. I found optics that have less of it and just sucked it up. It's possible. It's also a pain
[2022-12-16 20:34:23] <+SurefiredCB> Holosun dots are not perfect like aimpoint either
[2022-12-16 20:34:34] <%+xxxxkrypticxxxx> no shit?

[2022-12-16 20:34:47] <+TheHoggestBoss> @SurefiredCB aim point very over rated imo, clunky for what the are too

[2022-12-16 20:35:44] <+ieradiicate> @Redhawk511 The way it projects the light, and a holographic is superior for night vision.  Typically red dots will bloom badly under night vision.

[2022-12-16 20:48:51] <DankBizzer> the first 2 slots obviously

[2022-12-16 20:49:00] <mcgoon307> Would you rate my setup just from a pic?
[2022-12-16 20:49:00] <%tronzorb> @WillerZ That's why I pay to have my PC built and optimized by people who know wtf they're doing.
[2022-12-16 20:49:01] <%Dingbatz> dual channel goes 1 - 3 and 2 - 4
[2022-12-16 20:49:01] <madworldz> so what, put them in 1 & 3? how do you know which direction 1 starts and 4 finishes
[2022-12-16 20:49:02] <%+Spacenectars> from right to left 1st slot and 3rd slot
[2022-12-16 20:49:05] <DonDaBiscuit> i used to put my ram sticks next to each other too LUL
[2022-12-16 20:49:05] <+mortimer266> remember when you hear the crunch, thats when dual channel is activated
[2022-12-16 20:49:07] <steveBURNs> alternate
[2022-12-16 20:49:08] <%+TheeLostGrimm> yep
[2022-12-16 20:49:08] <%pervvyysage> no theres suppose to be a gap and whoever said there using 4 sticks is crazy
[2022-12-16 20:49:09] <%lyingdoorknocker> yeah
[2022-12-16 20:49:10] <+tutsu0> Always 2 - 4
[2022-12-16 20:49:11] <+KeeneyHD> @WillerZ but what if i only have 2 slots to put the ram?
[2022-12-16 20:49:13] <%+luciiiferr> Excuse me? It depends on the motherboard, refer to your manual to see which slots are for dual channel. My motherboard is side by side. @WillerZ
[2022-12-16 20:49:14] <+tutsu0> A2 B2
[2022-12-16 20:49:16] <%$Absolutzer0_v2> I make my ram into a T formation, shove one into a PCIe slot for fun
[2022-12-16 20:49:18] <+tutsu0> NO
[2022-12-16 20:49:19] <+Coxxyyx> your motherboard manual will have the slots you should have them in
[2022-12-16 20:49:21] <mussball> 2-4
[2022-12-16 20:49:23] <Vaski__> 1 3 and 2 4 but for some Z790 it's 1 2 and 3 4
[2022-12-16 20:49:23] <+tutsu0> A2 B2
[2022-12-16 20:49:23] <+KevboLocoT2K> you look at your mobo manual ez
[2022-12-16 20:49:23] <shish_kabob_> i wonder how many people dont go into their bios and max their ram out
[2022-12-16 20:49:23] <+DrVonSinistro> even worst: 4x 32gb on a ryzen 9 prevent the cpu to work at its Infinity Fabric speed
[2022-12-16 20:49:24] <%+l0fer> The motherboard usually has markings
[2022-12-16 20:49:25] VIEWERS: 2 183
[2022-12-16 20:49:26] <+Jonny1352> I think it's 2-4
[2022-12-16 20:49:28] <XchoznX> @willerz yo how many people in chat you think have mouse acceleration on?? Lol
[2022-12-16 20:49:28] <+Musitude> Sheet, had my gaming pc for 8 years and no one told me thta
[2022-12-16 20:49:29] <headhunterluis> wait is it bad if i have it 2 and 4?
[2022-12-16 20:49:30] <%smoke802x> @XchoznX then you should be good im no expert like i said
[2022-12-16 20:49:32] <%Colonel_Fodder> bonus of buying a prebuilt. not my problem XD
[2022-12-16 20:49:32] <%+Siimmy84> can i ask why?
[2022-12-16 20:49:33] <+tutsu0> A2 B2  2 and 4
[2022-12-16 20:49:33] <nxtlolz> i have only 2 slots :D
[2022-12-16 20:49:35] <+Musitude> What's the % speed increase
[2022-12-16 20:49:37] <%$Absolutzer0_v2> RAM goes in the PCIe slot below the GPU
[2022-12-16 20:49:41] <+almighty_biz> can you do 1 and 4? just curious on why it doesnt use it
[2022-12-16 20:49:41] <+KeeneyHD> f
[2022-12-16 20:49:41] <+Coxxyyx> its different on different motherboards
[2022-12-16 20:49:42] <%Alphaw> cumcasted
[2022-12-16 20:49:42] <XchoznX> @smoke802x Same
[2022-12-16 20:49:43] <+sw710jones> @headhunterluis just a different channel.
[2022-12-16 20:49:45] <BrokenSkull00> Start off closest to CPU as well.
[2022-12-16 20:49:45] <okxcomputer> i just look at it im 2-4
[2022-12-16 20:49:47] <%tozertho> oh i put them 1 and 3 cus i tought it would be better for heat
[2022-12-16 20:49:49] <%pervvyysage> @WillerZ is right its suppose to be 1-3 thats the best for ram
[2022-12-16 20:49:50] <Soyokija> what means comcasted
[2022-12-16 20:49:51] <%+xxxxkrypticxxxx> we are?
[2022-12-16 20:49:52] <BrainbowR6> Take your ram out and blow in it for better frames. Trust me bro.
[2022-12-16 20:50:02] <+thejock16> i only have 2 slots so we all good
[2022-12-16 20:50:02] <+tutsu0> @Coxxyyx only on RARE occasions its a standard
[2022-12-16 20:50:02] <%+ZWOGs> CALLED IT. They tried some shit about 3 mins ago
[2022-12-16 20:50:07] <raiinny0> Depends on the Mainboard actually but yeah for the Most its Slot 2 and 4
[2022-12-16 20:50:10] <gobu2> my motherboard has only 2 slots
[2022-12-16 20:50:12] <@%^Nightbot> If you are just lurking and enjoying the content. Will thanks you for being here but make sure you are followed so you can keep an eye on this cob slayer.
[2022-12-16 20:50:13] <stellaartois12> Should be 2 and 4. Less interference.
[2022-12-16 20:50:19] <%Reep_s> what happens if u have your ram right next to each other????
[2022-12-16 20:50:20] <+Djebzzz> Just checked mine its 2 and 4 luckily
[2022-12-16 20:50:21] <+tutsu0> I build and modify and tweak PCs for a living
[2022-12-16 20:50:21] <pduz> its funny how people demands 4 slots but that makes physical location off slots furher away from cpu and that adds latance
[2022-12-16 20:50:22] <%steppscav> how many people in chat you think have bottlenecks between ram and cpu
[2022-12-16 20:50:23] <royalscorch> Oh fuck. I should go check my comp after work lmaoooo
[2022-12-16 20:50:24] <%Reep_s> on slot 1 and 2
[2022-12-16 20:50:24] <pduz> latency
[2022-12-16 20:50:25] <%+luciiiferr> Do not listen to willerz, it is not always 1 and 3 for dual channel. Refer to your motherboards manual everyone.
[2022-12-16 20:50:30] <The_Dapper_Chef> I have 4 slots with 4- 8gig gs kills
[2022-12-16 20:50:36] <%smoke802x> mine recommends 2 and 4 so thats what i use
[2022-12-16 20:50:37] <The_Dapper_Chef> It should be like that? Lol
[2022-12-16 20:50:38] <sayers11c> hey man can i see your graphics setting when you get a sec? im trying to be as optimized as possible
[2022-12-16 20:50:42] <+impastanoodle> lmao
[2022-12-16 20:50:44] <+tutsu0> Iv helped MANY streamers build and speed their PC
[2022-12-16 20:50:45] <stellaartois12> 1 and 3 are physically closer, so always go 2 and 4.
[2022-12-16 20:50:54] <kri5tiannn> I got two sticks of 16gb 3200 and then two corsair dummy rams
[2022-12-16 20:50:54] <thetyler1special> How much does that affect performance?
[2022-12-16 20:50:55] <steazle> You also gotta wonder, "How many people haven't turned on XMP or adjusted their monitor refresh rates?"
[2022-12-16 20:50:56] <+impastanoodle> do 2nd and 4th slot
[2022-12-16 20:50:57] <TimNC89> what if someone has 3 ram sticks???
[2022-12-16 20:50:59] <ReaperEXX> what difference does it make to have em separated like that?
[2022-12-16 20:51:02] <Wulfgar_RED> 2 and 4 is most common
[2022-12-16 20:51:03] <%pervvyysage> @stellaartois12 huh
[2022-12-16 20:51:05] <shish_kabob_> if only people could read instructions
[2022-12-16 20:51:06] <BunnyTurds365> can they be 1 and 3 or 2 and 4, or do they always have to be 2 and 4?
[2022-12-16 20:51:07] <Atusid> @TimNC89  Check your mobo's documentation.
[2022-12-16 20:51:08] <%+luciiiferr> Lol okay.
[2022-12-16 20:51:09] <BrainbowR6> Manuals are for squares. don't be the guy that reads them!!!
[2022-12-16 20:51:16] <Atusid> @BunnyTurds365 It's different for each board.
[2022-12-16 20:51:23] <Vaski__> steazle xm-what ? Kappa
[2022-12-16 20:51:23] <%+Br41N1987> Every motherboard is different. Read your owners manual
[2022-12-16 20:51:24] <%tronzorb> @steazle 144hz monitor running at 60hz is optimal.
[2022-12-16 20:51:24] <Atusid> RTFM
[2022-12-16 20:51:24] <%joringeeel> Slot 3 and 6 for me, as stated in the Manual of the motherboard...
[2022-12-16 20:51:25] <The_Dapper_Chef> Oh so if you only have 2 in a 4 slot.. separate them. But if you have 4 sticks it’s okay for them to be together?

[2022-12-16 20:51:34] <+Coxxyyx> the same people need to go in to their BIOS and check xmp/correct clock sppeds
[2022-12-16 20:51:35] <%+Br41N1987> no rule of thumb applies to all

[2022-12-16 20:51:56] <%smoke802x> @BunnyTurds365 can be 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 some mobos tell you what slots are recommended if you are only using 2 sticks

[2022-12-16 20:52:42] <%+Br41N1987> most motherboards are optimized with all slots filled using lower storage and higher speeds in each

[2022-12-16 20:52:45] <Vaski__> 4 sticks is better for performance ( 2 or 3 % ) but create more issues with xmp
[2022-12-16 20:52:47] <%pervvyysage> @whoodatbecuh fuck it i guess like he said if the motherboard can handle it why not

[2022-12-16 20:53:03] <%hallowedjinx> @tronzorb just get a single 32 or 2x16 at that point
[2022-12-16 20:53:05] <%Dingbatz> and if you're running 16GB shame on you chat

[2022-12-16 20:53:26] <shish_kabob_> running 2 chanels instead of 4 is suppost to be better, so i hear, but i got 4 because i didnt want to buy 16's

[2022-12-16 20:54:27] <+Coxxyyx> @tronzorb well i think as long as you have the dual channels the extra 2 doesnt improve the same way
[2022-12-16 20:54:29] <%nevenx> On my old Threadripper mobo it had 8 slots, so with four sticks it was 1-3 + 5-7 for best

[2022-12-16 21:08:53] <+meancuisinee> I don't wanna get less than 100 frames
[2022-12-16 21:08:55] <%+Swider87> Yeah lemme put it out there the second i get my hands on a 4xxx series im using a 4k monitor
[2022-12-16 21:08:59] <!%+MadDogHux> 4K optimization isn't quite there yet IMO
[2022-12-16 21:08:59] <25Logan25> this is going to be a dumbass questoins but here goes: what else would i need alongside a 1440 monitor in order to run 1440 in game? like to i need shit for my pc as well?
[2022-12-16 21:08:59] <+KevboLocoT2K> no twitch drops they break the severs
[2022-12-16 21:09:03] <+Musitude> I'm 1440 but sometimes 1080 makes chunky targetst hat feel easyer to aim at
[2022-12-16 21:09:03] <Skotus> 1440 is no go for my 970
[2022-12-16 21:09:04] <+yettijd> thats a lvl 99 timmy gun right there boii
[2022-12-16 21:09:08] <%Z4PP__> @thelastleroy having offline is a great way to get better at situations, i dont think enough people take advantage of it
[2022-12-16 21:09:11] <%+ZWOGs> @WillerZ Can you call Nikita and tell him to whype?
[2022-12-16 21:09:14] <sharkittv> if drops confirmed on said dates wip must be atleast a week before
[2022-12-16 21:09:15] <BrainbowR6> legit hate twitch drops
[2022-12-16 21:09:19] <bill_lumbergh1> For streamers in general streaming is also a job like we have. They have no reason to get burned out if they get paid. Do you like your job every single day? No, but you still do it.

[2022-12-16 21:11:55] <djomla91> oh man i miss this game so much
[2022-12-16 21:11:56] <%karln7> in hideout
[2022-12-16 21:11:59] <%+postroute22> is parkour an actual skill in this game? or is it a combination of strength and others to be able to jump around like a spider monkey?
[2022-12-16 21:12:01] <TrickZHD> @TrickZHD ok ok thanks a lot man
[2022-12-16 21:12:19] <!%+MadDogHux> @Cyberwast3 What do you mean? They have the  memory cleaner Kappa
[2022-12-16 21:12:22] <%jambon_to_fakie36> remember me when i was workin in a bio shop, had to remember the code of every product going to 0-53000 to have the price
[2022-12-16 21:12:25] <%og_thundercat> i  get 170fps on max everything with a 3070 ti and an i5 13600k
[2022-12-16 21:12:30] <%+Swider87> getting close to 100 fps is important in tarkov because the second you open any secondary optic it creates an entirely new render and drops frames to nothing
[2022-12-16 21:12:31] <%2StoryDormsRat> imagine parkour max level
[2022-12-16 21:12:32] <+Arryyn> wavvvy

[2022-12-16 21:14:29] <%+GADOOOSH> @25Logan25 however, i would upgrade the CPU and GPU if your mother board will handle it. could do a bigger SSD as well like 1 or 2 TB .. keep in mind with the upgrades you might need a better case/coling/fans
[2022-12-16 21:14:32] <+yettijd> you really dont get burnt on tarkov? must be a true 1 game andy

[2022-12-16 21:47:01] <%Megachrist> Upscaling doesn';t magically give your monitor pixels.
[2022-12-16 21:47:02] <%+ShowtimeIX> i just spat my coffee out haha
[2022-12-16 21:47:05] <thompsoni90> dynamic res isnt the same
[2022-12-16 21:47:05] <sayers11c> why buy a 1440p monitor than. lmao
[2022-12-16 21:47:05] <@%^Nightbot> why not?
[2022-12-16 21:47:07] <%+turdburgler3000> You can push 1440p to a 1080 for it to look better but upscalings not as good

[2022-12-16 22:33:13] <Fourthcub> anything good at lvl 40?
[2022-12-16 22:33:21] <!%LickerOfFaces> if will is right he is asleeper agent for BSG
[2022-12-16 22:33:21] <BoltSauce> And for people wondering: the glasses are actually made of glass. It hust has a thin coating that filters out certain parts of the blue light. It doesnt filter out all of it, but only the the region that significantly affects your eyes. Do NOT use any harsh products to clean the glasses, it might affect the coating in the long run. Use the prescribed cleaning agents

[2022-12-16 22:33:53] <chops_games> blue light and natural light is good for you in the morning when you wake up. but as the day goes on you do want to wear glasses for blue light. it helps with sleeping and eye health if you do. (im not a neurologist but learned it from one)
