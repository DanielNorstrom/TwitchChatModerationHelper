[2022-12-20 18:41:51] <%+david_dm5> @ham_loveshashbrowns from the internet: "By the Oxford English Dictionary‚Äôs (OED) reckoning, the earliest record of draw, as in a contest that ends with no winner, comes in reference to an 1856 US chess match. Over the next few decades, writers marked off draw with quotes or italics, which shows the word was novel. The word was familiar by the 1870s.  This draw is short for draw-game, which the OED finds for a ‚Äútie‚Äù by 1825. A draw-game, in turn, is a variation on a drawn battle or drawn match "

[2022-12-20 20:52:47] <sashadav97> can't China, hypothetically, send one guy to candidates if they really wish with the regulations at the moment?
[2022-12-20 20:52:47] <!%suzanne_illy> abdulWiggle3
[2022-12-20 20:52:50] <moonlitmistral> magnus will probably turn down the spot by rating so the number 2 ranking will matter
[2022-12-20 20:52:54] <%randomaccessdaniel> i wanna see you in the candidates again :(
[2022-12-20 20:52:55] <+japanknight19> play 5 strong  blitz events
[2022-12-20 20:52:56] <ColdSonicGaming> I'm certain Duda will get the random spot. He thrives in uncertainty

[2022-12-20 20:53:10] <B0mbsquad01f> @GMHikaru idk if you're interested but Andy Woodward is winning against Ivanchuk in classical rn
[2022-12-20 20:53:14] <+dingmas> The Grand Prix was fun to watch this year, too.
[2022-12-20 20:53:15] <imikhail42> @chanr35 Can't say that. For example, Chinese and Alizreza does not played on chess com. And Chinese woman the best in chess
[2022-12-20 20:53:19] <%VisheshKabra> no excitement for the FIDE World championship

[2022-12-20 20:53:34] <+BurningHeat857> What if FIDE got the rights to the Grand Prix, but didn't get the "special sauce" that was the organizers and sponsor connections?
[2022-12-20 20:53:39] <%lojjik> Online tournaments possibility of becoming a path to candidates?
[2022-12-20 20:53:43] <asheraddo98> Cant china rigged it as usual with planning multiple tourneys ??
[2022-12-20 20:53:44] <Ardigam> is online chess taking over OTB FIDE? is OTB FIDE a dinosaur that will become extinct?
[2022-12-20 20:53:46] <+Cow_HS> Getting the rights back was so expensive they could no longer afford to hold the it

[2022-12-20 20:54:01] <hexajons> if you go to charlotte, you deserve a spot
[2022-12-20 20:54:04] <+japanknight19> yes but the tournament will have less weight.
[2022-12-20 20:54:08] <%storm2709> chesscom should buy chess from FIDE EZ
[2022-12-20 20:54:10] <livi0811> @GMHikaru The year is 2040 and Eric Rosen makes it to the candidates as he dominated all viewer arenas he competed in
[2022-12-20 20:54:11] <$tacticsandswindlesx> Imagine if Hans qualifies @GMHikaru
[2022-12-20 20:54:11] <hotdogman5972> can we do a viewer arena
[2022-12-20 20:54:12] <hotdogman5972> plz
[2022-12-20 20:54:14] <%+Freeman461> maybe this gets more high level players in these lower tournaments
[2022-12-20 20:54:14] <+badi_hs> 2 spots from grand swiss is A JOKE

[2022-12-20 20:54:19] <%+bassamr95> I mean, basically Ding Liren did the same thing to qualify to the candidates
[2022-12-20 20:54:22] <%passi_1479> @GMHikaru have you watched magnus interview afzer your match?
[2022-12-20 20:54:24] <+pedrosorio> inb4 super GMs losing a ton of rating drawing a bunch of games in tournaments full of 2500 GMs
[2022-12-20 20:54:26] <oma_twitch> @GMHikaru do you know KARATE?
[2022-12-20 20:54:26] <lukambo> yet you dont care tho

[2022-12-20 20:54:31] <M_O_V_E_S> People ignored that Ding went to the candidates by playing special tournaments in China, thoughts?

[2022-12-20 20:54:37] <PulitzerDevil> why did they ditch GCT
[2022-12-20 20:54:38] <$chanr35> @passi_1479 On Youtube already.
[2022-12-20 20:54:38] <bigsus300123> Hans will now try to qualify
[2022-12-20 20:54:40] <11sion> Is FIDE corrupt?
[2022-12-20 20:54:40] <savenature47> This just feels wrong honestly
[2022-12-20 20:54:43] <nordman95> @GMHikaru The weighting will ruin your score though. First at Norway Chess would probably get you 5 times as much points as crushing a norm tournament
[2022-12-20 20:54:44] <livi0811> @GMHikaru The year is 2040 and Eric Rosen makes it to the candidates as he dominated all viewer arenas he competed in....

[2022-12-20 20:54:48] <%VisheshKabra> any chance magnus gets qualified for candidates and refuses to play ?
[2022-12-20 20:54:49] <+WizardOfAuzzy> whats the purpose of the random spot, like which current players deserve to benefit from that rule would you say?
[2022-12-20 20:54:49] <asheraddo98> No Russia money OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 20:54:50] <%TriogamiL> Why does FIDE choose the most confusing and one of the worst possible ways? The apply this to almost everything lol @GMHikaru
[2022-12-20 20:54:50] <$chanr35> @passi_1479 He reacted to Magnus interview yesterday.
[2022-12-20 20:54:51] <%n3p2n> 1 by rating is China?
[2022-12-20 20:54:53] <Ardigam> OTB FIDE is a dino that will become extinct!
[2022-12-20 20:54:53] <MidRop11> NIce performans on CCGC!
[2022-12-20 20:54:57] <%redshark5784> I actually would hate if otb died
[2022-12-20 20:54:58] <%passi_1479> @chanr35 i know i just wanna know if he seen it
[2022-12-20 20:55:02] <%willystyles1> @M_O_V_E_S only works if you're 2800 already
[2022-12-20 20:55:08] <jibley__> Pog he said it
[2022-12-20 20:55:08] <%kappaklausisreal> So primitive Kappa Why not have the one who solves the Riemann conjecture be awarded a spot to the candidate tournament
[2022-12-20 20:55:09] <Pause2Reflect> @Ardigam Online chess is a great addition to the pro chess world. It's an addition to OTB, not a replacement.
[2022-12-20 20:55:11] <%+Berrysmoothyy> nakamuraWHAT give me a Tylenol for trying to understand
[2022-12-20 20:55:11] <sesquipedalias> why not all candidates spots by rating? isn't the best chess player in the world somebody in the top 8?
[2022-12-20 20:55:12] <%VisheshKabra> Any chance Magnus gets qualified for candidates and refuses to play ?
[2022-12-20 20:55:14] <doctoradi87> say something about Tesla  -7%

[2022-12-20 20:55:21] <@%+Creamsicle> Can't wait for the infographics to come out and educate me on how the system works
[2022-12-20 20:55:22] <ry4n_3> literally doesnt even care clearly, and it seems sus chat it seem sus, did i mention i literally dont care?
[2022-12-20 20:55:24] <+killahstreamz> would you play the candidates if you qualify?
[2022-12-20 20:55:25] <DexterStJock> I wonder how much Carlsen not defending affects them getting sponsors. He does pull in the crowds
[2022-12-20 20:55:28] <+monkofwisdom> They need to do an infographic as well!

[2022-12-20 21:03:40] <+WhatTheSheep> Do you think chess is different from the FGC scene, etc, where everyone can be friends?

[2022-12-20 21:04:15] <Kornobi_> Professional athletes do seem to have closer friends on different teams. That didn‚Äôt happen as much in the past
[2022-12-20 21:04:15] <thegreatdanton9> Guys come on hikaru can be wrong in 1000 things factually or analytically but save him your crap on chess stuff. There is thousands of hours of prep and competition.
[2022-12-20 21:04:15] <%+revoltaire99> Magnus is a friend of Howell how is not at the same level which proves your point
[2022-12-20 21:04:15] <+tackzone> @GMHikaru From a grandmasters perspective would you say nickelback improves brain activity

[2022-12-20 21:04:57] <Kornobi_> Vishy is the GOAT
[2022-12-20 21:04:59] <cipherlistic360> Hikaru is a solid individual
[2022-12-20 21:05:00] <rudys213> Jobava 250+ in rankings, but plays as top20 player for sure
[2022-12-20 21:05:01] <%brainstorm_18> ofcourse PogO
[2022-12-20 21:05:01] <+jubbs> everybody remembers that

[2022-12-20 21:05:05] <+torq_ca> @Ruski_Boi_Joe Simon Williams (GingerGM) dubbed it Jobava london.  The Jobava London that he made is based of Jobava's games
[2022-12-20 21:05:05] <thegreatdanton9> Vidit and Anish are cordial but not friends

[2022-12-20 21:05:27] <hritik1810> Rajdabov- Mamedyarov are also close friends, they have like 20 draws with no wins for either side in classical
[2022-12-20 21:05:28] <Ardigam> Where is Peter Svidler? Is he still active playing tournaments or did he retired?
[2022-12-20 21:05:29] <+DeeJayPancakes> @gmhikaru which was a more proud moment for you when you were getting

[2022-12-20 21:05:54] <sebcio_wk> @gmhikaru spectate match by jobava's stream maybe
[2022-12-20 21:05:54] <+mjensen16> I finally got 1100 in 10min with no real training, just watching videos on YT, what openings would people recommend for both white and black
[2022-12-20 21:06:07] <Thevio> @malmegame frequently asked question, no he doesn't
[2022-12-20 21:06:14] <Pause2Reflect> @livi0811 Just imho, speed chess skill seems to fluctuate between top players more than classical. Today maybe Hikaru is the best, next week could be Magnus, the first Tuesday of next month could be Narod, etc.
[2022-12-20 21:06:18] <josuejcaraballo> Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic?

[2022-12-20 21:21:49] <Dohnr> nihilistic view
[2022-12-20 21:21:50] <vSookie> that was pretty cool

[2022-12-20 21:21:56] <thegreatdanton9> 100 game blitz 3+2 match I think Magnus will win 65% 3+1 55% 3+0 40%
[2022-12-20 21:21:57] <+dms833> It's hard to believe that, I definitely wouldn't be able to just not care at all when playing the GOAT in chess

[2022-12-20 21:22:16] <MrTedMcForehead> amazing how a guy like hikaru who regularly competes in and wins major pro chess events says ''im not a pro chess player anymore''. but people like the botez's and annacramling who've never played high level or pro chess in their life refer to themselves as pro chess players, lmao.

[2022-12-20 21:25:15] <%beelzedubchess> Is the Magnus Effect < or > Hikaru Effect? Magnus said he didn‚Äôt feel it but I think, for him, playing you has extra something to it.

[2022-12-20 21:25:41] <juangm68> 2 to 1 is NOT the expected winning margin for Magnus against Jobava
[2022-12-20 21:25:41] <+Tarandoff> Do you think Magnus will try to take back the title next year?

[2022-12-20 21:25:50] <+Foolsarecool> Is there a decay on rating points?
[2022-12-20 21:25:50] <gelllllly> did you contemplat. letting magnus mate you in the last for the funsies, to head to one final bullet game for all the marbles
[2022-12-20 21:25:53] <Qulala> personality also helps a lot for invites i guess?

[2022-12-20 21:26:44] <nietzschestrueself> btw on your earlier point about fusion, the main reason US only gave 3bn is because ITER is part of an international effort with 35 countries also donating. im sure theres also domestic startups as well so plenty of reason to be hopeful. however I share your frustration about Iraq @GMHikaru
[2022-12-20 21:26:44] <itsPincus> do u think magnus is the best ever? @GMHikaru .

[2022-12-20 23:47:43] <aparaititos> Of course all of today's super gms are much better than, say, Lasker or Alekhine, but that's also because people have built on the foundations that others have laid. That's why I think that it depends on how you view a top 10.
