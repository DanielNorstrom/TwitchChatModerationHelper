[2022-12-21 16:43:22] <chompchomp8> yeah pomegranate seeds are epic
[2022-12-21 16:43:27] <jopoglist1> devs need to acquire taste and brain to buff based characters
[2022-12-21 16:43:33] <chompchomp8> they sell them in cups full of pomegranate juice
[2022-12-21 16:43:44] <tinkymfwinky> @shadder2k the edible part is called the "aril" so maybe if you look for them in the supermarket you might find them
[2022-12-21 16:43:49] <audio_noodle> it's funny to think that if we didn't need anything but carbohydrates, we just live off of alcohol, since really high energy density

[2022-12-21 16:52:34] <jopoglist1> @tinkymfwinky it boops further than lucio
[2022-12-21 16:52:37] <Mr4xTheDon> But if you think supports being dead is a bad thing then you probably think fights lasting 10 minutes is a good time
[2022-12-21 16:52:43] <tinkymfwinky> what the fuck that is insane
[2022-12-21 16:52:45] <%vinnyhongx> very passive tank
[2022-12-21 16:53:19] <jopoglist1> @Mr4xTheDon they shouldn't be dps tier dmg output, but you can't have somebody a walking meal for flankers, it is not fun at all
[2022-12-21 16:53:33] <sinnv_> thats better than saitama

[2022-12-21 16:53:45] <%ThifaNicolle> @Mr4xTheDon it's not because shadder is the best genji that others will play the same way, genji is an unpredictable character because every player moves differently, what for me is difficult for another would be easy

[2022-12-21 16:54:39] <Mr4xTheDon> @thifanicolle Genji players have the same objective, the way they move doesn’t change that

[2022-12-21 16:55:17] <%ThifaNicolle> shadderShrug
[2022-12-21 16:55:33] <chompchomp8> they way they should encourage zen to stay alive is by playing with teams that can peel and playing distance because he has no falloff and discord and harmony have really long range
[2022-12-21 16:55:51] <chompchomp8> giving him a boop with no cd to punish flankers is dumb
[2022-12-21 16:55:56] <Mr4xTheDon> @jopoglist1 Are you new to the game? You must not have been around when zen dominated the meta it never was fun, nobody is sympathetic towards zen players
[2022-12-21 16:56:14] VIEWERS: 775
[2022-12-21 16:56:14] <chompchomp8> also it disproportionately effects some heroes like genji, whereas tracer will literally never notice it
[2022-12-21 16:56:25] <jopoglist1> @Mr4xTheDon so it is justifiable to have character that only purpose is to die to genji?
[2022-12-21 16:56:44] <cc22> Kinda crazy they thought about giving zen more 25hp lmao
[2022-12-21 16:57:00] <Mr4xTheDon> @jopoglist1 Why do you think supports should be able to win 1 v 1’s against dps be fr for a second
[2022-12-21 16:57:04] <chompchomp8> the entire point of zen is a glass canon, making him less diveable is removing the glass and just making him a canon
[2022-12-21 16:57:21] <Mr4xTheDon> Defeats the purpose of dps

[2022-12-21 19:33:58] <SmokeNScorch> Bro that nade is so dumb it should be a sticky not magnetic
[2022-12-21 19:34:12] <InquisitorGadget> and sojourn was new and shiny, they don't want to nerf the new and shiny thing
[2022-12-21 19:34:15] <switchbladessss> nice
[2022-12-21 19:34:32] <+KillKoraji> ohh okay apparently there was a Q&A with alec dawson on twitter and someone asked "Now that the DPS passive changed, are you going to revert the Genji changes? or at least some of them? I feel like the nerfs hurt him a little bit too much.."
[2022-12-21 19:34:36] <+KillKoraji> then alec replied to the tweet with "With any of our balance changes we'll see how those heroes do afterwards. If we look at Sombra and Zarya, those were too harsh. Genji is still in the mix but we'll see how much the passive changes his standing. If he drops too far, could see one of those changes being reverted."
[2022-12-21 19:34:47] <SmokeNScorch> No reason you should be able to miss and still land the nade
