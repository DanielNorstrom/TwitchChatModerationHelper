[2022-12-22 07:56:26] <%$fittyleben> no of red changed hearthstone people would enjoy it and Blizzard wouldn‚Äôt be able to feed off of all the poor miserable souls
[2022-12-22 07:56:27] <$littleladykitten> They really should hire full time arena streamers for card balance
[2022-12-22 07:56:36] <!%+vintagerudy> lol
[2022-12-22 07:56:50] <+MisturDZ> why do they still make shop items for classic mode..... who tf is every gonna buy that
[2022-12-22 07:56:51] <+texasisbig> @littleladykitten our most expensive energy bills are in the summer, youre lucky!
[2022-12-22 07:56:52] <KKhadgar> I do wish battlegrounds had been a separate game that used the same flavor, rather than built in the same client. Battlegrounds is really dope, but it's taken a long time to get there IMO.
[2022-12-22 07:56:53] <%+unhwut> @redbeard think you'd dig his music

[2022-12-22 08:04:11] <KKhadgar> Yeah, i enjoyed watching TFT back in season 1. I tried to go back for season 2, but it was a lot. Now they are on what, season 19? who knows, everything is different and I can't really follow watching it.

[2022-12-22 08:07:04] <%+unhwut> but too late
[2022-12-22 08:07:08] <StarsyNA> DotA 2 the champions don't even have names and you end up playing something like "Sniper" or "Ogre 3"
[2022-12-22 08:07:11] <KKhadgar> underlords was valve's attempt to make an official version
[2022-12-22 08:07:29] <%+RMJlol> same message every month

[2022-12-22 08:08:33] <StarsyNA> no i don't think there's an Ogre 3
[2022-12-22 08:08:40] <StarsyNA> but I'm pretty sure there's an "Ogre Magi"
[2022-12-22 08:08:46] <%+unhwut> sniper is a dota character. it's a rifleman lol
[2022-12-22 08:08:49] <NakedEyeFungii> they used the ones from Dota 1, except copyrighted names from Blizz
[2022-12-22 08:08:50] <StarsyNA> some of them have names
[2022-12-22 08:08:58] <KKhadgar> original dota just changed all the names of the warcraft characters to not be the same though, so instead of jaina, you had like "frost mage" or maybe "Freezey" or whatever.
[2022-12-22 08:09:27] <%+RMJlol> sometimes lucky
[2022-12-22 08:09:28] <timmac24> i had a dream before that hearthstone became 3D lol i was so hyped and then i woke up didnt even get to play

[2022-12-22 08:09:54] <%+unhwut> dota 1 looked better tbh. dota 2 has color composition problems
[2022-12-22 08:09:56] <KKhadgar> @timmac24 it is 3d now though, if you buy the skins in the shop for $39.99! and only death knight and hunter Kappa

[2022-12-22 08:16:54] <!%+topdekka> I‚Äôm not sure why you can‚Äôt get a Credit card, in other news there a guy in Perth Australia with 7 maxed cards under the name Zack Beard
[2022-12-22 08:16:56] <StarsyNA> I used to be the worst at remembering to pay the credit card so I'd always miss a month or two and then pay off the whole thing at once.. apparently that made me their favorite customer ever. Now they don't like me as much since I have it set up to pay automatically every month

[2022-12-22 08:20:31] <%+unhwut> @elitetactics2 there are multiple types of credit scores for different types of loans, but you can get the score your bank pulls. also credit karma etc is usually relatively close.

[2022-12-22 08:33:40] <+ublighthero> jade druid was my favorite deck honestly
[2022-12-22 08:33:46] <midliciouss> jade druid made control decks unplayable that was the problem
[2022-12-22 08:33:56] <+JoblessFr3ak> and innervate gave 2 crystals
[2022-12-22 08:33:56] <%+unhwut> not just technically, there were two exodia decks for ot
[2022-12-22 08:33:58] <%+unhwut> it

[2022-12-22 08:34:48] <%+unhwut> nah. was already tons of ramp. no need for innervate
[2022-12-22 08:35:17] <midliciouss> double innervate nourish wild growth

[2022-12-22 08:35:35] <TuckTheAssassin> I think innervate was nerfed by the time Jade Druid was a thing
[2022-12-22 08:35:49] <%+unhwut> it has wild growth, jade blossoms, and maybe nourish. innervate would be too much

[2022-12-22 09:31:56] <midliciouss> but as a former og player i still have some wild cards i can use for some tavern brawls
