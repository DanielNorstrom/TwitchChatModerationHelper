[2023-01-04 16:59:35] <%+Gios1337> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.

[2023-01-04 18:20:49] <VeeXYZ> I think super mentioned his reputation made it more valuable or something
[2023-01-04 18:20:49] <maffthinks> I mean, yeah if you're gonna consider I

[2023-01-04 18:38:27] <@^Nightbot> I saw Cloudy in a 4K lobby one time. I told him how cool it was to meet him in game, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for friend request or anything. He said, “Oh, sr peak check?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” while using the “No” voiceline repeatedly.

[2023-01-04 21:31:21] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content
