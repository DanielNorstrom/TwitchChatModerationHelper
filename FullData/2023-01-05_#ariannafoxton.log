[2023-01-05 19:47:35] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> one advantage of buying refurb electronics stuff, it's that you're sure it won't be dead on arrival.

[2023-01-05 19:48:01] <martysbigiron> @YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus tell that to my PSU that i got refurbished, and it was dead on arrival
[2023-01-05 19:48:24] <mchdoney> that song just hint hard thank you
[2023-01-05 19:48:24] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> dead on arrival = not working out of the box
[2023-01-05 19:48:28] <SetPhaserstoPun> when stuff is refurb'd they check it, when it's "new" they don't
[2023-01-05 19:48:39] VIEWERS: 131
[2023-01-05 19:48:44] <SetPhaserstoPun> so there's that chance that shit just borked and you got unlucky

[2023-01-05 19:49:41] <NinjasaurusRexatron> refurbished = they run the same checks and standards as new production inspection
[2023-01-05 19:49:43] <martysbigiron> yeah i sent it back and got a refund

[2023-01-05 19:49:47] <martysbigiron> so it was all good
[2023-01-05 19:50:10] <NinjasaurusRexatron> it is as good as new, as long as it comes with original manu's warranty
