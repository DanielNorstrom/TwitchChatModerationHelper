[2022-12-30 14:21:05] <jarragorn> im curious
[2022-12-30 14:21:08] <!%moshcraft> i don't think the game failed for that reason. giving free stuff to early adopters is nothing if the game actually grows but they had zero social features
[2022-12-30 14:21:20] <%sp1cy_gr> Other games like Fortnite and Valorant make money off cosmetics, I guess that's what they wanted to go for. But it's card games so nobody cares KEKWait
[2022-12-30 14:21:25] <flaitherback> I guess snap brought it all the marvel fan base. Gwent more niche

[2022-12-30 15:47:31] <Pi_____________> if you really dont know, gwent is not going to receive any more support starting from 2024
[2022-12-30 15:47:42] <Pi_____________> it's up to you if you'd like to get into the game
[2022-12-30 15:47:51] <Pi_____________> but it's officially dying
[2022-12-30 15:48:16] <cibc777> why aren't they supporting it anymore?
[2022-12-30 15:48:24] <Pi_____________> cuz it's a failure

[2022-12-30 15:48:44] <@%elquellora_> tbh because it's not relevant in business plan
[2022-12-30 15:48:54] <@%elquellora_> they made an interview to the heads of cdpr
[2022-12-30 15:48:59] <tumy99> will they do a postmortem of some sort?

[2022-12-30 15:50:25] <Pi_____________> @cibc777 watch freddy's last gwent video if you're interested
[2022-12-30 15:50:40] <@%elquellora_> but marketing wasn't never good @cibc777 and some wrong balance decisions make a lot of player quit
[2022-12-30 15:50:42] <angrandforquet> tbh last year no card game having good days, look at hs having their autobattler mode way popular than actual game

[2022-12-30 15:55:33] <he2isenberg> im gonna tell you guys whats the cancer with gwent for new players
[2022-12-30 15:55:45] <irrrregular> @he2isenberg i know the answer
[2022-12-30 15:55:51] <%Mohrrix> Card games are inherently niche, and within that niche market only a small fraction of people actually know how to play them, so the more casual card games see more success
[2022-12-30 15:56:00] <he2isenberg> @irrrregular tell me

[2022-12-30 15:57:58] <yous_ackman> Are we overestimating the pull from the Witcher world in general. I mean I loved the games and thought gwent was cool despite not being a card game player. However, I would zero interest if was marketed to me ‚Äò as a  cool card game‚Äô

P.S. this is a subjective take but CDPR should've invited you to be a caster, considering u released more greant content than they did over the year
