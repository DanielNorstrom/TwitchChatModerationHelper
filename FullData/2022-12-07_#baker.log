[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <%Renektolijus> looks nuts

[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <%+zeshlal> wish the bed wasnt christmas themed, not that I can afford it anyways KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:35:07] <%+VaselineHC> i never played it but tbh every stream i watched of LE it seemed like people were emulating PoE builds so the gameplay looked similar except for bossses have actual mechanics
[2022-12-07 17:35:10] <%+VaselineHC> could be wrong though
[2022-12-07 17:35:24] <%+zeshlal> @VaselineHC devs are huge poe fans
[2022-12-07 17:35:36] <%Renektolijus> how much for the BOOBA bed?
[2022-12-07 17:35:55] <%Renektolijus> 15k -> cheap

[2022-12-07 17:36:00] <%+VaselineHC> @VaselineHC guess that makes sense
[2022-12-07 17:36:21] <%Renektolijus> bro I can barely make that amount from raiding on my 1 character
[2022-12-07 17:36:24] <%+zeshlal> @VaselineHC they even said they were release leagues alternating with poe
[2022-12-07 17:36:33] <%hoodidupeh> you always look at other games
[2022-12-07 17:36:34] <memohandsome> catJAM
[2022-12-07 17:36:45] <%hoodidupeh> but d4 will never have the depth of poe
[2022-12-07 17:36:49] <%+VaselineHC> if i did my raids for the past few weeks i would have >15k :)
[2022-12-07 17:36:54] <%SyzzAMV> Arctic Monkeys POGGIES POGGIES POGGIES POGGIES
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <+handrooo> is the mats chest from the frog rly worth the gold for the result to be random as you cant pick the rewards

[2022-12-07 17:40:49] <%+VaselineHC> @Renektolijus apparently was shit on release but is a lot better now
[2022-12-07 17:40:49] <%Renektolijus> with zaaambies
[2022-12-07 17:40:52] <%+zeshlal> i thought maint would fix dc's peepoSad
[2022-12-07 17:41:03] <%Renektolijus> @VaselineHC he's a boomer so he pretty much likes anything OMEGALUL
[2022-12-07 17:41:23] <%+OMGitsPredator> they better give selection pack for compensation
[2022-12-07 17:41:28] <Yomigaeru> imagine you get dc'd in g5 or 6 and can't continue with your group monkaS
[2022-12-07 17:41:34] <%+GarudasSong> is reaper your main?
[2022-12-07 17:41:47] <%+VaselineHC> @Renektolijus teach him to grind out your alts on LA:)
[2022-12-07 17:41:58] VIEWERS: 559
[2022-12-07 17:42:04] <%+enotiqe> can i touch your striker ?
[2022-12-07 17:42:09] <%Renektolijus> @VaselineHC only mmo he pretty much liked was MU online and silkroad, doubt he'll like LA
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <@%+strengthie> oh god this song reminds me of a WILD summer
[2022-12-07 17:42:21] <melflce> @Yomigaeru if that happens to me i legit quit the game
[2022-12-07 17:42:34] <%+VaselineHC> @Renektolijus tell him about the booba;)
[2022-12-07 17:42:41] <%+OMGitsPredator> KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:42:49] <%+enotiqe> my booba is on prevention, no worries
[2022-12-07 17:43:07] <Yomigaeru> @melflce understandable, I mean our static should be fine to fix it, if it happens between g1-4, but not in g5 or 6
[2022-12-07 17:43:43] <%Renektolijus> @VaselineHC I don't really recoemmend LA to anyone tho, unless I know that they're good at games (raids are pretty challenging to learn, esp with ppls requirements)
[2022-12-07 17:43:51] <melflce> @Yomigaeru ok, yeah lets hope for the best with a little dose of COPIUM
[2022-12-07 17:43:57] <%+enotiqe> btw 14 december is the worst time to release brelshaza.... soon is christmas and so many people will be out
[2022-12-07 17:43:59] VIEWERS: 559
[2022-12-07 17:44:24] <@%+strengthie> @enotiqe Lots of people travelling for school and holidays
[2022-12-07 17:45:03] <%Renektolijus> the game requires shit tons of time investment as well
[2022-12-07 17:45:15] <%Renektolijus> btw thoughts on buses? you prolly get that a lot KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:45:59] VIEWERS: 559
[2022-12-07 17:46:35] <%+VaselineHC> @Renektolijus i might have disagreed before but i'll be missing brel prog so i know when i come back it'll be a fckin nightmare to learn - i think brel will force more hardcore static groups. so yeah i see where u are coming from... but who knows maybe i'll try it in the new year and not find it that bad
[2022-12-07 17:47:06] <%Renektolijus> earn gold to buy skins
[2022-12-07 17:47:08] <Yomigaeru> I only bought busses for lower alts in the past, which had like no gear
[2022-12-07 17:47:09] <%Renektolijus> profit
[2022-12-07 17:47:19] <Yomigaeru> scouter for example, I bought a valtan hm bus for him
[2022-12-07 17:47:24] <%Renektolijus> woww okay
[2022-12-07 17:47:37] <%+OMGitsPredator> @Renektolijus just swipe for skins KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:47:40] <Yomigaeru> but I would never buy a clown bus KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:47:44] <%Renektolijus> I only bussed argos so far
[2022-12-07 17:47:49] <Yomigaeru> I'd rather ask for a carry for carry with my static
[2022-12-07 17:47:52] <%Renektolijus> so that I could afk it while working, cba doing it KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:48:00] VIEWERS: 559
[2022-12-07 17:48:07] <Aeowinh> I feel is a lot of nuance there, since in one hand you need to get stronger to get in later raids, if you don't get accepted then bus is the only out for some people
[2022-12-07 17:49:06] <Aeowinh> But the problem is people take the best they apply, there are people that are good and accepted but told me they were rejected for days
[2022-12-07 17:49:09] <Aeowinh> last week
[2022-12-07 17:49:13] <Aeowinh> doing clown for example
[2022-12-07 17:49:17] <%SyzzAMV> you might not get in a party - but you can make your own party with 4x3 and clear
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <melflce> i mean its saint lol
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%+VaselineHC> people set weird standards for groups... i've had kimqi rejected for valtan hards:/

[2022-12-07 17:50:14] <%Renektolijus> is that enough to get into a party for hard vykas?
[2022-12-07 17:50:15] <Aeowinh> I feel like people can learn raids and is good, yes there are bad players that want to get carried but a lot of requirements for parties is pretty high
[2022-12-07 17:50:18] <Aeowinh> nowadays
[2022-12-07 17:51:07] <%Renektolijus> the funniest requirements part is that ppl put them on guardian raids
[2022-12-07 17:51:10] <%Renektolijus> I cringe so hard
[2022-12-07 17:51:53] <%+VaselineHC> oh shit, below 100k gold Baker... so disappointed

[2022-12-07 17:52:41] <%+zeshlal> I buy bus bc it's too tedious to go to party finder, I will either end up with full mokoko party or just get gatekept at my current progress
[2022-12-07 17:52:59] <%+zeshlal> when I'm at current content I will do it
[2022-12-07 17:53:36] <@%+strengthie> It was faster for me to find a group to bus than it was for me to do argos last time I was on

[2022-12-07 17:58:35] <%Renektolijus> Vykas was the most enjoyable raid in the game for me
[2022-12-07 17:58:51] <%Renektolijus> not that I did anything higher than that

[2022-12-07 18:06:05] <Aeowinh> I was thinkin about changing main but Enthopy Glavier is kinda fun and with bracelets is pretty nice dps
[2022-12-07 18:06:12] <%Renektolijus> it's amazing how good the pass is, went from 1400 to 1455 in a week (good rng as well)
[2022-12-07 18:06:25] <%Renektolijus> the only gatekeeper is the gold
