[2022-12-27 03:55:33] <@%rexodiak> the melody there was not right
[2022-12-27 03:55:38] <%$Andinyan> I wonder if Arale counts as a rare Pokemon?
[2022-12-27 03:55:49] <%Artourr> what about digimon?
[2022-12-27 03:55:51] <%$Andinyan> (technically she is a Dragonball character as she cameoed in DB)
[2022-12-27 03:55:53] <%+soulwillin1997> I grew up with Pokemon, Digimon and Dragon Ball
[2022-12-27 03:56:10] <@%rexodiak> YOU CAN IMPRISON GOD IN THOSE BALLS
[2022-12-27 03:56:12] <@%rexodiak> WHY NOT HER
[2022-12-27 03:56:20] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Arale is a character from a comedy toriyama series
[2022-12-27 03:56:38] <%Hyper_Sonic__> Saiyan and Frieza were best
[2022-12-27 03:56:40] <%+soulwillin1997> tournament arc? OH That's original Dragon Ball when Goku was a kid
[2022-12-27 03:56:47] <%$Andinyan> Actually, she did cameo in a Dragonball chapter.
[2022-12-27 03:56:49] <%Artourr> she is a robot and loves poop
[2022-12-27 03:57:05] <%+soulwillin1997> never heard of that?

[2022-12-27 03:58:38] <%+Eylluyn> hot take: gen one is just nostalgia bait
[2022-12-27 03:58:42] <%+plagueddegeneracy> LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-27 03:58:42] <%SnowySylveon> no way, the legend of zelda language
[2022-12-27 03:58:44] <%+soulwillin1997> minish cap was great
[2022-12-27 03:58:44] <%Artourr> it's the best zelda game!!!!

[2022-12-27 03:59:14] <%$RTSAvalanche> I just bought Zelda Links Awakening yesterday for switch!  (I hear it captures alot of the magic of the original)
[2022-12-27 03:59:15] <%Hyper_Sonic__> Truth
[2022-12-27 03:59:18] <%+soulwillin1997> Gen 2 was my introduction to the proper Pokemon games, especially Soul Silver
[2022-12-27 03:59:24] VIEWERS: 119
[2022-12-27 03:59:31] <@%rexodiak> oh so like... a port? but then why do all of what they did
[2022-12-27 03:59:38] <%Artourr> another hot take: gen one is nostalgia like every nintendo game
[2022-12-27 03:59:44] <%Hyper_Sonic__> well yeah, it has the Pokémon go mechanics
[2022-12-27 03:59:52] <@%rexodiak> why can't they just port all the games all of them
[2022-12-27 04:00:09] <%+soulwillin1997> I've been playing Breath of the Wild Wii U with mods so I can play as Zelda, it's pretty cool playing her
[2022-12-27 04:00:09] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Link's Awakening DX is a great zelda game
[2022-12-27 04:00:32] <%Hyper_Sonic__> I can vouch for the links Awakening for Switch, really benefits from quality of life improvements
[2022-12-27 04:00:49] <ELFucilaNeroIV> My first GBA games were Megaman Zero and Castlevania AoS
[2022-12-27 04:00:54] <%+soulwillin1997> yeah they have a bit
[2022-12-27 04:01:03] <gold_draws> my first game was pokemon platinum
[2022-12-27 04:01:07] <@%Giygasinbattle> gen 1 being nostalgia bait isn't really a hot take, it's all I've heard about gen 1 for the past like... 10+ years. negnasLul
[2022-12-27 04:01:12] <@%rexodiak> Pokemon Coliseum please Nintendo NOT A REBOOT NOT A REMAKE JUST PORT THEM
[2022-12-27 04:01:15] <%lebuttduster> Man, I haven't given a Pokemon game a fair shake in a long while, Violent/Scarlet seem interesting enough to try out

[2022-12-27 04:01:54] <%+soulwillin1997> technically my first pokemon was Pokemon Stadium for N64
[2022-12-27 04:02:14] <%Hyper_Sonic__> I don't know what Nintendo is up to, they're very quiet recently
[2022-12-27 04:02:19] <gold_draws> giratina is my fav gen 4 pokemon
[2022-12-27 04:02:28] <%+soulwillin1997> I think they haven't ported them cos they're trying to find a way to monetise it
[2022-12-27 04:02:30] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Virtual console was too good for this world, I guess
[2022-12-27 04:02:35] <@^StreamElements>* 🐺 gold_draws is now a Neggpal! 🍆
