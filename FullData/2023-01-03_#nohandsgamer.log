[2023-01-03 01:40:10] <%snaktray> that needs more of an explanation
[2023-01-03 01:40:27] <%snaktray> @caybellHS super repetitive issues with fast movements of the wrist
[2023-01-03 01:40:31] <RamBo2307> @NoHandsGamer this is nuts never met anyone with anything similar. I had them start in my right radial fingers, then spread, Then got surgery for CTS that did nothing. Then the symptoms got replicated to my left side
[2023-01-03 01:41:02] <caybellHS> that sounds so scary
[2023-01-03 01:41:14] <caybellHS> can't imagine going through that you guys are courageous

[2023-01-03 01:44:02] <%monie1127> @nohandsgamer it’s no biggie if you ignore this, tbh I wasn’t gonna ask but… Ik your not playing rogue for your reasons LUL but I’m tryna learn it and besides fishing for graveyard, is your objective also to get as much concoc’s as you can get to win?

[2023-01-03 01:59:30] <InvisionHS> Even Korean guys want to know of your sex cult
[2023-01-03 01:59:34] <Darwal> sex cult? what?
[2023-01-03 01:59:43] <ArabNScarab> Is it just for chronic pain in general? I can barely sit in a computer chair for more than 30 minutes at a time anymore because a nerve or smth in my neck starts to hurt
[2023-01-03 01:59:51] <Fawzi412> @NoHandsGamer can you explain to the newbies here what sex cult is?
[2023-01-03 02:00:03] <%맛좋은무화과 (jasochoi)> i see the word every time i watch this stream LUL LUL

[2023-01-03 02:00:19] <coiax> @Fawzi412 the first rule of the sex cult is not to talk about fight club
[2023-01-03 02:00:23] <jean_peuplusdutout> I feel no pain, should I still read it? Kappa
[2023-01-03 02:00:32] <%vayazu2> sex cult is code for streamer privacy
[2023-01-03 02:00:36] <InvisionHS> Maybe I'm happy but asymptomatic Kappa
[2023-01-03 02:01:02] <%RattlegoreLMBO> Sex cult is an orgy organization
[2023-01-03 02:01:08] <%RattlegoreLMBO> self explanatory
[2023-01-03 02:01:19] <%맛좋은무화과 (jasochoi)> i see
[2023-01-03 02:01:31] <RamBo2307> The similarities are crazy. Thanks for the chat will definetly get it done.
[2023-01-03 02:01:48] <coiax> it's actually just an organization dedicated to complaining about "Rheyn-thal" in all forms
[2023-01-03 02:01:52] <Meeseeks_> Aww the title is a lie
[2023-01-03 02:02:01] <%RattlegoreLMBO> could be Spanish lessons at a local community college
[2023-01-03 02:02:06] <coiax> or possibly advocating the return of "Rheyn-thal"; it's unclear

[2023-01-03 02:08:59] <%vayazu2> if blood dk does anything it would be to counter this deck

[2023-01-03 02:09:33] <+cinnamonchair> frost dk counters rogue
[2023-01-03 02:09:43] <%+Xeath5> @cinnamonchair no
[2023-01-03 02:09:46] <%+Xeath5> no it doesnt
[2023-01-03 02:09:56] <jean_peuplusdutout> nah
[2023-01-03 02:09:59] <%+ucdchris1> it kinda does, but frost dk cannot ever win if rogue goes high roll early turns
[2023-01-03 02:09:59] <%snaktray> lets see the stats on it
[2023-01-03 02:10:03] <$astroworldhs> Blood Dk hard counter Rogue

[2023-01-03 02:10:20] <optimusslime47> Aggro mage is p good against rogue

[2023-01-03 02:10:36] <optimusslime47> Not exactly hard counter tho

[2023-01-03 02:10:44] <%vayazu2> at top legend i don't think anything counters miracle rogue
[2023-01-03 02:10:47] <jean_peuplusdutout> only DH and thief rogue have very light advantage against miracle
[2023-01-03 02:11:22] <+oribasius> whatever happened to amnesiasc?  I know he went away to college, but did he quit hearthstone completely?
[2023-01-03 02:11:33] <+cinnamonchair> oh i looked at the stats and this is the only counter deck to rogue, frost dk is 50/50
[2023-01-03 02:11:33] <youngmoneygangsterqq> anything can counter miracle rogue its literally whoever highrolls wins
[2023-01-03 02:11:46] <+Bigbudha_23> he died
[2023-01-03 02:12:03] <%vayazu2> if it needs to highroll it's not a counter

[2023-01-03 02:12:20] <%RattlegoreLMBO> @oribasius he played from time to time and seemingly developed into a decent young man :)

[2023-01-03 02:12:34] <bchillings> tank mmr and ur fine kekw
[2023-01-03 02:12:39] <+oribasius> @Bigbudha_23 he probably saw what happened to his friends (Purple and Zalae) and decided to avoid a public persona.
[2023-01-03 02:12:48] <RamBo2307> what do you think about Jalexanders takes? I honestly think his takes are pretty bad but the is so arrogant that you can't discuss anything with him
[2023-01-03 02:12:56] <+oribasius> @RattlegoreLMBO well, that's a nice twist to the story.
[2023-01-03 02:13:06] <%+DrEvil69I> A pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel down his pants The bartender pointed out,"You have a steering wheel down your trousers." The pirate replied, "Aye! It's driving me nuts!"

[2023-01-03 02:14:03] <viedwarden> theres a new warrior list with the 4-4 that destroys a location. seems like it could be good against miracle but it loses to everything else probably so only worth playing in top legend where everyone is rogue
[2023-01-03 02:14:10] <%+Xeath5> change list?

[2023-01-03 02:15:10] <%vayazu2> that's fair and people do that for renathal too
[2023-01-03 02:15:25] <RamBo2307> Jalexander is so smug in his ways that might be it.
[2023-01-03 02:15:27] <melidolas> just remove mystra
[2023-01-03 02:15:35] <%+DrEvil69I> theres a new concede priest list with the 7-91 that destroys a hero. seems like it could be good against concede priest tier s lists but it loses to everything else probably so worth playing in super high top legend where everyone is based

Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2023-01-03 02:32:56] <Akaryn87> i dont think rogue is a good class for now, they only have infinite refill, removal and value trough cocs. Ok they got insane tempo plays and can kill you turn 4. But they dont got enough heal, so to complete the class we need to add some healing spells with spell damage, card draw and some random minion and spell discover for like 0-1 mana.

[2023-01-03 03:04:05] <%vayazu2> that would help but more likely gnoll would be nerfed for all cases @InsomAtLaw

[2023-01-03 03:25:17] <+AComcastEmployee> do the others in the sex cult care about HS rank @NoHandsGamer
[2023-01-03 03:25:18] <Akaryn87> Well NoHands you might not realize it but hearthstone is a game where you have to think ahead. You need to counter play your opponent and play to the win condition of your deck. Thats why you needa deep knowledge of the game and also a huge amount of experience playing against all decks. If i put that all together and think about the best plays... it doesnt matter cause you just die to rogue no matter what Kappa

[2023-01-03 03:53:52] <Zaxlor> Yeh learning that sometimes the best play is in fact not the most "efficient" or combo driven is a hard skill
[2023-01-03 03:53:57] <%vayazu2> people have trouble computing opportunity costs like that
[2023-01-03 03:54:14] <ScarecrowCR> so people that said match the number at the top left of the card to your mana crystals weren't lying after all...

[2023-01-03 05:14:09] <%rexmkh> rogue seems like the harder class to nerf since they are so many variations

[2023-01-03 05:14:35] <Zaxlor> @rexmkh I think both Brand and Feast of Souls go up to 2 mana. They're the damage/draw engine of that deck and I don't think they're meant to be played for 0 mana

[2023-01-03 05:15:47] <Zaxlor> @rexmkh God knows how you "fix" Rogue though KEKW The location probably goes to 4 mana. Maybe Maestra rotates early? To be fair, the potions call all be nerfed by -1 damage/-1 card draw
[2023-01-03 05:16:12] <%rexmkh> yeah, the rogue destroy minion effect seems a bit busted for its cost
[2023-01-03 05:16:13] <%TentoMan> cut eggs for pelicans again thoughts? Hatch time?

[2023-01-03 05:16:46] <B0re_d> @Zaxlor making potion belt give you 2 different cocs all the time would probably fix the 3 mana draw 4
[2023-01-03 05:16:50] <dont_stop_meow> Instead of discounting stolen cards, they should go up in cost instead
[2023-01-03 05:17:03] <+Clymos> @grimbleeper yeah I guess hope for ramp Druid would be to just combo first and live off of chitinous, but scales feels a lot less relevant there since if you play a big minion to scales it gets murdered by brand. I could definitely seethe more aggressive board decks doing it though, that makes sense, just sad because that’s definitely not my jam. Appreciate the note though!

[2023-01-03 07:14:00] <+negative_ghost_rider> Meati has been complaining about a lot of nerfs he thinks rogue needs. Shadowstep nerf possibly?
[2023-01-03 07:14:28] <hstraxamillion> things are looking up this game ngl
[2023-01-03 07:14:32] <randomer22> no, astalor should be changed before step is
[2023-01-03 07:14:40] <dendaihs> Team 5 nerfing shadowstep would be like trying to make a sandwich without bread
[2023-01-03 07:14:43] <boringweeb2761> the cards shadow step is stepping are op not shadowstep

[2023-01-03 07:15:53] <randomer22> I would take stealth away from the location ghosts and do something to tune down the potion belt interaction with gnoll
[2023-01-03 07:16:48] <hstraxamillion> tbh tho if rogue gets nerfed dh just runs over the game, sinful brand everywhere, and the game gets even more linear and toxic
[2023-01-03 07:17:03] <+MrXxplicit> they gona prob hit both
[2023-01-03 07:17:11] <hokagedohs> @hstraxamillion well dh actually has more counters than rogue
[2023-01-03 07:17:16] <randomer22> oh yeah I would revert the unleash fel nerf and change both unleash fel and brand to 2 mana
[2023-01-03 07:17:19] <hokagedohs> druid for example
