[2023-01-09 18:34:21] <%TheMajesticChunk> for trapper I like to set up a few traps in the beginning then find a survivor and chase them towards it
[2023-01-09 18:34:22] <OcbKait> then the next time.. i blinded myself.
[2023-01-09 18:34:30] <%TheMajesticChunk> and at the end i trap the exits lol
[2023-01-09 18:34:32] <%SunLukong> First time I played it I hated it but it was because someone who was in my group was super toxic and was the "IF I DON'T LIVE I AM SULKING" type of player
