[2023-01-08 17:48:36] <zuuuuug> @GingiTV do you think fire will be better than arcane with the buffs coming in 10.0.5
[2023-01-08 17:48:38] <+kwoss> @rosstherosstrich problem is you can't "learn" arcane in lower keys cause arcane sucks there. So you kinda have to ffa it in higher keys
[2023-01-08 17:48:39] <+SolaniumG> that's kinda true for most pugs, you almost never see people using personals

[2023-01-08 18:16:47] <+kwoss> is it important to have a dagger in oh as outlaw? currently rocking 2 2.6 weps but also low ilvl
[2023-01-08 18:16:48] <RaxxFPS> You need daggers as sub no
[2023-01-08 18:16:49] <DrRadzig> generally speaking, its not much. It's just that daggers apply more poison ticks and it results in more overall dmg.
[2023-01-08 18:16:50] <+ReflexzTV> are your weakauras for subs or do you have them anywhere? @GingiTV
[2023-01-08 18:17:04] <+Kaidienz> dont u need 2 daggers for mut?

[2023-01-08 18:17:16] <snepixtv> is sub better or outlaw for M+?
[2023-01-08 18:17:17] <Chr0nicConsumer> it depends on Shadow Techniques, idk if it's a proc % chance or a proc per minute
[2023-01-08 18:17:19] <+Kaidienz> ya but you said for ass/sub
[2023-01-08 18:17:22] <%+Jiqraw> i think it doesnt matter what your offhand is as sub
[2023-01-08 18:17:22] <xli89> is a sword in offhand bad for sub? or it doesn't matter?

[2023-01-08 18:20:23] <+wilzoo_> @GingiTV u need to macro cold blood with secret techniques
[2023-01-08 18:20:25] <ringoisnotimpressed> sub needs more brainpower than outlaw
[2023-01-08 18:20:28] <Chr0nicConsumer> yep, sub is for OGs
[2023-01-08 18:20:31] <+apeemann> Shadow Techniques is not normalized this makes a slow weapon in offhand usually weaker.
[2023-01-08 18:20:36] <%+Jiqraw> what? outlaw needs more, 100%
[2023-01-08 18:20:38] <+Mehdehh> @ringoisnotimpressed XD
[2023-01-08 18:20:40] <DrRadzig> how it has 3 buttons?
[2023-01-08 18:20:42] <DrRadzig> HUH
[2023-01-08 18:20:44] <Chr0nicConsumer> sub is way slower
[2023-01-08 18:20:51] <tegelane> sub in st is a sleeper
[2023-01-08 18:20:51] <nakhtii> !wa
[2023-01-08 18:20:53] <WheelPin> Outlaw is higher APM
[2023-01-08 18:20:55] <therealbalazs3k> sub is 2 button aoe, outlaw maybe 15
[2023-01-08 18:20:56] <Johnernnn> JPC was pumping as sub yday its probably just as good as outlaw or better kek
[2023-01-08 18:20:56] <datfeejk> @ringoisnotimpressed topkek, nice one
[2023-01-08 18:20:57] <therealbalazs3k> xDDD
[2023-01-08 18:20:58] <Chr0nicConsumer> the only "hard" thing is maxing secret technique
[2023-01-08 18:21:00] <%+Jiqraw> outlaw is omega APM

[2023-01-08 18:21:08] <+theflaves> Outlaw has too many procs to keep an eye on
[2023-01-08 18:21:10] <%+Nokturno_> outlaw is 100mph sub is way more chill
[2023-01-08 18:21:12] <ringoisnotimpressed> nah you need to position for ruptures , and to sequencing properly for danse macbre
[2023-01-08 18:21:14] <+FFFrank_95> SS + BLACK POWER / SS + SecTec repeat

[2023-01-08 19:44:54] <%vortemix_> @GingiTV Do you think Outlaw is better overall (disregarding specific dungeons) or is the difference between it and sub not that big? Asking as I like sub more but don't want to suffer in pug keys for it :D
[2023-01-08 19:45:05] <+bingbongsanchez22> @GingiTV where should i burn my channelpoints for? We need poops
[2023-01-08 19:45:40] <Jonnybxtv> @vortemix_ its dungeon specific, in AA you play sub for the uncapped aoe since that costs more time in the dungeon. Outlaw will do better in smaller packs.
