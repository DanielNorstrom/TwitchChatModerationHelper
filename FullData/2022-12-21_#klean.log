[2022-12-21 00:02:42] <%+xaviouski> I know it has nothing to do with this game but what do you think this whipe will bring us?
[2022-12-21 00:03:10] <FoxHunterTV> I closed steam out of system tray, when I opened it back up, update was available

[2022-12-21 00:05:56] <%+BarelyABearr> @BOYJEZUS yes just like tarkov
[2022-12-21 00:06:03] <leinad_xyz> @BOYJEZUS  that`s the high roller section
[2022-12-21 00:06:07] <BOYJEZUS> oof. alrighty

[2022-12-21 00:06:39] <leinad_xyz> @BOYJEZUS any match-p contains different teams, sing, duos, trios
[2022-12-21 00:07:01] <hobbes8calvin586> does shield on back block or just helps with stats?

[2022-12-21 00:11:24] <+Hank1929> how brutal is this game solo?
[2022-12-21 00:11:36] <SuperFriendBFG> Solo is very brutal
[2022-12-21 00:11:45] <MsYakumo> @Hank1929 Very class dependant.
[2022-12-21 00:11:49] <+Jigokuson> Pretty brutal its a lot of skulking around and running away
[2022-12-21 00:11:53] <BOYJEZUS> @barelyabearr oh for sure. with games like this I try and watch a bit of footage get a basic grasp of how things work. I really dig what this game does
[2022-12-21 00:11:53] <%+BarelyABearr> @Hank1929 Its not too bad, just have to be really aware. Rogues are a little easier as you can just stealth around groups
[2022-12-21 00:12:20] <SuperFriendBFG> Only Rogue and Ranger are viable solos
[2022-12-21 00:12:42] <%+BarelyABearr> @Hank1929 But I leveled both a fighter and rogue to 20 being a solo player. Its doable, just got to really learn the game
[2022-12-21 00:12:45] <SuperFriendBFG> Wizard maybe? Probably really tough
[2022-12-21 00:13:02] <+Hank1929> hmm yeah I started a fighter, i'm level 4 so far

[2022-12-21 00:13:33] <MsYakumo> You need to REALLY know your shit as a wiz.
[2022-12-21 00:13:55] <BOYJEZUS> someone told me priest is a solid solo. is there much Merit to that?
[2022-12-21 00:14:10] <MsYakumo> Otherwise you will get mulched.
[2022-12-21 00:14:10] <+Hank1929> s/priest/cleric/
[2022-12-21 00:14:11] <%+BarelyABearr> @Hank1929 Just run from groups of 3 until you get gear. once you get some greens you can really start to try to challenge them
[2022-12-21 00:14:35] <Rodgeriangames> The mage is fuckin sweet
[2022-12-21 00:14:35] <+Hank1929> @Hank1929 hah, I feel like I'm not skilled enough to even run at this point, but ok

[2022-12-21 23:34:46] <hunt559> vs a person with base gear thats not fair at all
[2022-12-21 23:35:05] <jmilly094> @kanedamascus agreed
[2022-12-21 23:35:37] <Bounty_Fox> @hunt559 you're not supposed to pick a fight  with someone like that if you have base armor
[2022-12-21 23:35:49] <jmilly094> @klean have you been running high roller and if so is it worth?

[2022-12-21 23:51:34] <%+zaccray> 23rd i believe
[2022-12-21 23:51:56] <@Madoc_BM> seems like spellbooks have much faster casting than staffs?
[2022-12-21 23:51:56] <@%Ring> Devs have been known to extend playtests but its Christmas so maybe not
[2022-12-21 23:52:20] <@%Ring> @Madoc_BM Yes they do, staffs let you bonk with them though and the crystal ball lets you have an offhand dagger

[2022-12-21 23:52:54] <+pp_zach> staff bonk good
[2022-12-21 23:53:12] <@Madoc_BM> is it?
[2022-12-21 23:53:13] <%+xSandmann> some of these names in the kill feed are reminding me of the names you would see in the early tarkov days lmao
[2022-12-21 23:53:35] <p0tatosaIad> oh yeah they are pretty....bad
[2022-12-21 23:54:04] <@%Ring> Staff physical hit can be good if its a like a blue, they can deal like 30 damage which can be relevant as the swing speed is kinda fast
[2022-12-21 23:54:27] <p0tatosaIad> as long as you get your bonks in before you get cleaved
[2022-12-21 23:54:32] <@%Ring> especially if you get them low first with spells
[2022-12-21 23:54:35] <@Madoc_BM> not sure if weapons should have a speed stat, but it's can be deceiving with just damage and move speed
[2022-12-21 23:54:51] <@Madoc_BM> like spiked mace is garbage compared to flanged mace
