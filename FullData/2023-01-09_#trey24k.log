[2023-01-09 01:17:57] <jakeapotamus> Not really. Their was a time when ppl would farm killa because of his spawn rate. They would go in naked with a mosin and LPS and just be outta raid in 10 min. Was lame af. I love this spawn rate. So unrealistic to see bosses every raid.
[2023-01-09 01:17:58] <%buuuunta> he prolly has no heals

[2023-01-09 02:08:28] <+Hot_Sauce_Guy> @Trey24k so there is usually a  house that is shared between people on rumspringa, the families typically know where they are although sometimes they dont, they are supposed to have no contact but that doesnt happen, its usually such an overload that most go back within a year but some choose to leave and join the modern world
[2023-01-09 02:08:29] <@%^b3njamino> NadeSpamSam grave mistake

[2023-01-09 03:23:14] <+thepasttenseofdraw_> Its just hard to get ammo and mags for, expensive
[2023-01-09 03:23:18] <%cato556> I miss the days when AS VAL was the best. Resort release was fire with that gun
[2023-01-09 03:23:20] <%+youngbaggg> ammo and mags make it a pain to use

[2023-01-09 04:05:26] <+GuinnessC_> @Trey24k what about just up the spawn rate and up the number of items for the quest to like 5

[2023-01-09 14:20:01] <%losafolk> @notZhan i understand the idea behind it but their gear isnt even that crazy. I feel like they should almost always if not always be there and then give like a 10% chance they have their good gear on

[2023-01-09 16:10:21] <$phwnEZ> @SpartanCam they decreased spawns in crackhouse and im a cheap ass, ur right tho it isnt that bad
[2023-01-09 16:10:22] <%Chumbo767> Not really. Their was a time when ppl would farm killa because of his spawn rate. They would go in naked with a mosin and LPS and just be outta raid in 10 min. Was lame af. I love this spawn rate. So unrealistic to see bosses every raid.
[2023-01-09 16:10:27] <%$WushuDeathKICK> @n8theasian twitch makes you do a fast restard though
[2023-01-09 16:10:28] <%$OlliePCK> there should be a 1% chance to choke when eating food because realism

[2023-01-09 17:38:37] <%SteremyJeele> Nothing like a huge spike upward, then automatically down, then back up. Recoil pattern looks like a fuckin sine wave.
[2023-01-09 17:38:38] <+ChickkyNuggyy> @Trey24k is recoil different than previous wipe? or what's so wrong about it?

[2023-01-09 18:03:16] <%$nine2nate> lol thats so funny cuz I was just looking at the ammo chart last night and i was wondering how those 3 ammos weren't banned from flea
[2023-01-09 18:03:17] <$cluelesschemist> it won't be long till flee is just hideout items
[2023-01-09 18:03:22] <%Shinyleprechaun> make barters better and make flee more limited
[2023-01-09 18:03:23] <%alexcarp33> or killing the same cheater back to back on labs

[2023-01-09 18:03:45] <+SoulPhade> why not just build a better anti cheat instead of making the vast majority of the playerbase suffer
[2023-01-09 18:03:46] <kelson___> They can lock onto certain body parts so what‚Äôs the point
[2023-01-09 18:03:46] <@%^derks> just fix all the issues in the game in 1 patch peepoRiot
[2023-01-09 18:03:49] <%+mikegully> haven't played wipe this time around are cheaters a big issue this wipe? @Trey24k
[2023-01-09 18:03:49] <MerckQT> m80+ aimbot head bone = gone

[2023-01-09 18:03:53] <%mcCrimson845> Have they banned flying fromt he game or the sniper boss' gear off the flea?
[2023-01-09 18:03:57] <@%^StreamElements> FOLLOW TREY ON INSTAGRAM (HOT GAMER IMAGES) (REAL) https://www.instagram.com/trey24ktv/?hl=en

[2023-01-09 18:04:00] <%$nine2nate> @Shinyleprechaun making flea a hideout component actually not bad idea

[2023-01-09 18:04:24] <%Shinyleprechaun> i honestly find M80 pretty often in raid
[2023-01-09 18:04:24] <%+lord_reksai> whats the point in making changes around cheaters/rmt though.... thats so stupid to punish everyone because of the small group of people that do cheat
[2023-01-09 18:04:25] <DakDak_210> they could just go lighthouse kill antler boy and the dudes get a few rounds of 338 ap and each shot is a kill LuL
[2023-01-09 18:04:27] <%wakey118> i like it i think gun fights will last longer
[2023-01-09 18:04:27] <%YEEWAK> @Ogchampayne i know man. it's a bummer - i enjoy everything that tarkov is... i just don't have the grind time in my life for it right now. :(
[2023-01-09 18:04:28] <%$WushuDeathKICK> you can craft like 120 a day

[2023-01-09 18:04:37] <six_pep> yeah, that's great
[2023-01-09 18:04:39] <+Zombi3Farmer> nakita has no idea how to manage cheaters so he takes it out on the rest of the players by constantly banning shit
[2023-01-09 18:04:39] <%mlodyyy____> ye idk

[2023-01-09 18:04:56] <%mlodyyy____> 120 a day is not even 1 run
[2023-01-09 18:04:57] <%Vaii_rl> I had 25k BP last wipe just from crafts alone @Trey24k

[2023-01-09 18:05:00] <%Shinyleprechaun> @Shinyleprechaun theres so much potential with limiting the flea and focusing on traders

[2023-01-09 18:05:03] <Nyquillis_Dillwad> i thin k they should just delete m61 and anything over 55 pen regardless

[2023-01-09 18:05:12] <+MILWAUKEEZ_BEST> did they buff 556?
[2023-01-09 18:05:14] <m3atzzz> bp is off traders?
[2023-01-09 18:05:14] <%+deejydee> they need to ban the obv cheaters on the flea market with over 300 million roubles sold etc

[2023-01-09 18:05:20] <+DubSacDevoe> What changed did they make?
[2023-01-09 18:05:23] <%1trench> switching guns every raid should be normal, use everything you like
[2023-01-09 18:05:24] <%elimud> TacTec/TTSK barter at ragman lvl 3 is gonna be so op now stock up while u can

[2023-01-09 18:14:57] <%dappyreturns> After a wipe or two, and you learn how players move, and where people are going to peak, you start to fall on equal advantages. I dont belive there is a huge skill gap, other than First wipe vs 10th wipe

This is cringe.

[2023-01-09 18:40:51] <+TallBoy_Ryan> the ump isn‚Äôt too good it‚Äôs just everything else being unusable caused it to be an outlier.

[2023-01-09 18:41:17] <%ciditi> just get rid of camera recoil cause it makes it feel like your PMC is pepega. And then turn off that automatic recoil recovery, dampen down the first/second shot recoil. You can still have recoil, just don't make it so wild

[2023-01-09 19:34:49] <+orangelive13> He's averaging 91 damage per kill. Clearly legit
[2023-01-09 19:34:53] <+tbone_ii> like that guy last wipe that didn‚Äôt stream himself getting kappa

[2023-01-09 19:54:50] <deepinurdad12> that would be sad and it would pretty much give the all clear to more hackers
[2023-01-09 19:54:50] <Drew_OD> They can‚Äôt detect fucking shit man, if they didn‚Äôt detect it automatically they can‚Äôt manually
[2023-01-09 19:54:51] <%+Hald_47> with no raid replay system in place its always going to be hard as fuck finding cheaters

[2023-01-09 20:03:45] <%$NadeSpamSam> you should allow a variance @Trey24k of about %5 for spawn rates , that would be a golden deal
[2023-01-09 20:03:45] <itslancev3> he has the looting and lucky enchantment thats why
[2023-01-09 20:03:45] <KuriVR> I'd hate to talk shit about a content creator but noiceguy just tinfoil hats nearly anything and spreads misinformation LOL
[2023-01-09 20:03:45] <+AirRun8> it helps noice "report" new stuff when a hacker who is far ahead of everyone is giving him all the details. It hurts noice to say he is cheating.

[2023-01-09 20:54:03] <!%c10v3rk1n6> It‚Äôs not that he was wrong. It‚Äôs that he‚Äôs getting attacked from internet fuk bois for a mistake. And that‚Äôs that

[2023-01-09 21:31:36] <%+willt17> He got tracksuit apparently lol
[2023-01-09 21:31:36] <%$casey__crowe> Cheaters avoid fights so they don‚Äôt get caught.
[2023-01-09 21:31:39] <erkenax> are you happy about the ammo changes cause now getting shit on by lvl 30 players wont happen as often?
[2023-01-09 21:31:40] <spoonfullofrav> mb caps
[2023-01-09 21:31:41] <Sabbelwakker> him having tracksuit is the final nail in the coffin
[2023-01-09 21:31:41] <+therealbankbusta> oh you mean hes playing the game
[2023-01-09 21:31:41] <bootyraider420> well he cant do that or he would get banned
[2023-01-09 21:31:42] <+xmr____> who said he has tracksuit
[2023-01-09 21:31:42] <+dom_menance> the reason is because players will report the hacker. Scavs dont
[2023-01-09 21:31:43] <+atom_p4nda> He is legit i think
[2023-01-09 21:31:43] <%$prontotov> how did he get the exp then
[2023-01-09 21:31:43] <%bmartkindasmart> @trey24k yo I gotta say that Kevin character was strange as fuck

[2023-01-09 21:31:46] <+GIMMETHEL00T> His scav rep is 6.47 LMAO
[2023-01-09 21:31:46] <+aBuckoh> 66% headshot though?
[2023-01-09 21:31:50] <%eft_IAteYourHamster> @CourtesyLick Includes rogues and raiders
[2023-01-09 21:31:50] <gramaha1> its imposible to have fence rep so high few weeks after the wipe started
[2023-01-09 21:31:52] <%+lippmann33> are people actually defending this kev dude? wtf
[2023-01-09 21:31:52] <+kingcoopuh> is 197 boss kills already even feasible in 400 raids total @Trey24k
[2023-01-09 21:31:52] <%lxcasxd> who is this kev anyways lmao

[2023-01-09 21:31:52] <%narwh4l3> I think he might be legit...
[2023-01-09 21:31:52] <!%bigdmyfriend> @Trey24k noiceguy says he will quit YT if he is cheating KEKW
[2023-01-09 21:31:53] <%+dirtydocjeff> He‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúgood cheaters‚Äù that everyone always talks about
[2023-01-09 21:31:53] <+Dystelix> he doesnt have tracksuit
[2023-01-09 21:31:54] <diacetylmorfun> @KBallsForever id also like that
[2023-01-09 21:31:55] <%buuuunta> no fucking way he has tracksuit with 400 raids
[2023-01-09 21:31:55] <$xxxJDAMxxx> is Kev Smittys Alt account Kappa Kappa
[2023-01-09 21:31:55] <+9mffin9> is it better to let your stam get all the way down to empty or just before red chat ive heard different things
[2023-01-09 21:31:55] <%+Nerdtron08> He's avoiding players with ESP to not get banned.
[2023-01-09 21:31:55] <%+thespagoogler> 6.47 scav rep. over 700m kill. has track suit
[2023-01-09 21:31:56] <%MayhemMo> let me guess, he only cheats to kill other cheaters or some other lame excuse for being a cheater
[2023-01-09 21:31:56] <%Vanilla_MSF> @Trey24k fuck all this cheater BS, hows your progress to Lightkeeper?
[2023-01-09 21:31:57] <ello425> hes only looted 164 places
[2023-01-09 21:31:58] <+xmr____> he doesnt have tracksuit what are you guys talking about
[2023-01-09 21:31:59] <M0NTANAx> who are u guys talking aout
[2023-01-09 21:31:59] <%Chuppy_tR> @hexedlotus you just dont use grizzly ive used 40 at level 42
[2023-01-09 21:32:02] <deepinurdad12> when u have two baller pvpers like trey and 2thy obvi u gonna have more pmc kills
[2023-01-09 21:32:03] <chonibandit> he's kinda sus the way he pvps
[2023-01-09 21:32:04] <%+Jakeyko> i mean the less pmc kills the less reports so no ban i guess?
[2023-01-09 21:32:04] <%elimud> my man uploaded his singleplayer tarkov save file
[2023-01-09 21:32:06] <+0k_nyle> @Br41N1987 949 raids
[2023-01-09 21:32:06] <%+NihilTL> @NihilTL yeah bro dude backed into me
[2023-01-09 21:32:06] <%+FQLYstyle> also, the 705m shot doesn't mean he killed whatver he was shooting at. just means the shot hit, easy to do on lighthouse with the rogues tbh
[2023-01-09 21:32:06] <ZerkaOce> He wouldn‚Äôt show all his stash lmao @trey24k
[2023-01-09 21:32:07] <%0verEasy> I feel like the downtime you avoid with a radar can't be overstated. He can get into raids and know exactly where to go and where to not go.
[2023-01-09 21:32:07] <Lointhecut> So why is his least damaged area his stomach? That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
[2023-01-09 21:32:09] <%WESTY_666> @Trey24k BRUH this kevin LOLOLOL

[2023-01-09 21:32:29] <platypus_w> he probably cheesed scav rep by killing pmcs using radar in raid
[2023-01-09 21:32:30] <KrisstroniK> 1 more killa for tracksuit lets go!
[2023-01-09 21:32:32] <%narwh4l3> 66% hs rate aint that bad. 0.43 overall accuracy is kinda high. But he actually might be legit

[2023-01-09 21:33:01] <%YEEWAK> @9mffin9 Depends on what you're trying to do. In general, no - I like to leave a quarter of a bar or so so if something happens, I can still skedaddle.

[2023-01-09 21:33:26] <+AndrezinTTV> that's why you don't heal for free within the first 5 levels

[2023-01-09 21:33:36] <$heckingfrick> You need to decline therapist healing then use the grizzly from stash
[2023-01-09 21:33:36] <%tilo_schwarzbach> not therapist
[2023-01-09 21:33:36] <KaoticShadow> Buy part of the heal from therapist and do the rest with grizzly?

[2023-01-09 21:33:39] <+Equinox_Zo> Grizzly heal is more effective and cheaper
[2023-01-09 21:33:40] <%+Lustful_ttv> im about over this

[2023-01-09 21:35:46] <jenusi9974> bsg nearly always only bans when there's a ban wave, even if you're rage hacking, so he could be cheating and won't even be banned until a ban wave hits
[2023-01-09 21:35:47] <Meta_Mario> Maybe they do something finally about all the cheating now that its so blatent they dont do shit.

[2023-01-09 21:52:25] <$rfarmer969> Cheer100 So quick retort from a friend about the nerfs: AP ammo was our only defense against those who rmt for gear and cheat (esp/walls not necessarily aimbots). Even besides those people how are people who play less than 10 hours a week compete with people who treat it like a job. Personally I see somehow how nerfs are good but it's one that seems really extreme all of the sudden especially since wipe just launch and this change would've been better to find 2 weeks ago when no one had jackdidy

Personally on attachments like I mentioned to klean is that guns need to be 80-90% of the stats and the attachments need to be a mix of looks and minor things like pattern of recoil and minor adjustments.

[2023-01-09 22:14:42] <$rfarmer969> Cheer100 I also wish to add, I think a good change would be the removal of wipes with these changes sooner than later. Allowing us to progress sanely and do other things I think would be a good accompaniment and a healthy break for the community if we could grind more recreationally. Like I just hit 20 and I wanna play other games but I know I need to play more not less if I wanna get farther since I'm a slower player. Like taking a break and coming back to my stash not reset is a good rite?

[2023-01-09 22:44:48] <+DaBassist> I already found the boss hunt insufferable before. Just another one of those things keeping me away from Tarkov even with Streets being out @Trey24k

[2023-01-09 22:44:55] <%J4umet> isn't it easier to get killa in streets?
[2023-01-09 22:44:55] <shotoman> i feel like 5% makes no sens imo
[2023-01-09 22:44:55] <%beansauer> Everyone always says where is killa. But no one ever says how is killa?
[2023-01-09 22:44:56] <+SnakeShotty> had to drive home from work is Kev cheating or not has the plot thickened? @Trey24k
[2023-01-09 22:44:57] <%$gourmetmilk> kev would probably hunt killa with the revolver

[2023-01-09 22:45:37] <%+DntDeservePromo> I've heard bsg will make killing Kev a mandatory quest for kappa next wipe
[2023-01-09 22:45:43] <Von_Therium> There should be a way to locate Killa. There are cameras all over the mall, then use the security room in "secret". to be able to spot him.
[2023-01-09 22:45:43] <+DaBassist> Is Killa's spawn chance on Streets any higher?
[2023-01-09 22:45:44] <+FuLLyReKTT> order it to your new address, silly
[2023-01-09 22:45:44] <spagl_> people so shook that someone other than a streamer  got kappa first

[2023-01-09 22:45:45] <+docspace> @harrywang274 He ran up on Killa in the BEST spot... but a hacker decided to ruin the fun
[2023-01-09 22:45:47] <jenusi9974> @shotoman it's probably just because of early wipe so that you don't get clapped by every boss
[2023-01-09 22:45:50] <%jakeandbake334> you will find kill next raid
[2023-01-09 22:45:50] <StFermat> killa next raid calling it

[2023-01-09 23:37:53] <%SteremyJeele> @Trey24k I think a lot ofpeople in chat don't understand that it's not JUST this thing that's making him want to leave. He has said it many times before that it's incredibly stressful for him.
[2023-01-09 23:37:55] <PWNut> hes probably burnt out and this was a way of him taking action so people would understand a bit better
[2023-01-09 23:37:56] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> @kisukes_hat people poor and stupid lmao

[2023-01-09 23:38:10] <Hypnos517> Hi Bro
[2023-01-09 23:38:13] <+Clarked21> I binned a YT channel after a couple of months because I couldn‚Äôt deal with the abuse I go online. Totally understand his POV
[2023-01-09 23:38:15] <%lawsonaw> No way he makes 6 figures, pretty sure your videos have to be at least 8 minutes long to even make money off it
[2023-01-09 23:38:17] <%ArturoGJ> It also sucks ass that BSG doesn't post any information. So he spends a ton of time just looking for it on his own.  That definitely sucks @Trey24k

[2023-01-09 23:38:32] <%$WushuDeathKICK> if he did feel happy yesterday and today he feels like shit, he needs an evaluation.
[2023-01-09 23:38:32] <%+56kconnection> no cap, he should get some therapy anxiety
[2023-01-09 23:38:33] <!%c10v3rk1n6> No. But today didn‚Äôt help

[2023-01-09 23:39:23] <@%ethan8855> @stopdodgin Great point. For a lot (most?) of the people here we‚Äôre coming to this community to escape the monotony and drama from work. Having it be your passion, but then also your job, makes it a whole different stress level
[2023-01-09 23:39:25] <PATCHEZinSPACE> people look up to him and that kinda thing gets to people
[2023-01-09 23:39:31] <%may__bee_> especially at the start of a new wipe

[2023-01-09 23:39:39] <+JohnnyBoxes> what even happened though?
[2023-01-09 23:39:40] <+supremeoboon> if you make 100k+ a year off that i feel like that's a lot less stress to handle than a lot of "real" jobs
[2023-01-09 23:39:47] <%$Taynk_> hes a youtuber that covers coverage on a game. he isnt some national newspaper that checks every source. he literally didnt do anything wrong. he just used the info that was available to spread and help the community
[2023-01-09 23:39:47] <jeffd428> then yhe'd do all that work - turns out it's a bug
