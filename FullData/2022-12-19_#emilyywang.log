[2022-12-19 04:21:06] <@%^Nightbot>* ✨Come hang out with us in the discord!✨ https://discord.gg/emilyywang ✨
[2022-12-19 04:21:09] <Starkovius> I LOVE THREAT
[2022-12-19 04:21:11] <+iCeMqN26> @BlackSkyReformed ty :)
[2022-12-19 04:21:14] <nelly_070903> threat op
[2022-12-19 04:21:16] <+CptRoast> they don't have synergy therefore no dice
[2022-12-19 04:21:24] <+navemai> I think it would be less of an issue if Vel'Koz wasn't a unit.
[2022-12-19 04:21:24] <%octopusoctopusoctopus> just remove threat ok
[2022-12-19 04:21:27] <horneyviewer> fuck it scrap dice
[2022-12-19 04:21:28] <%CtrlEric> ok
[2022-12-19 04:21:36] <+jombeta> maybe 3 threats instead  of 5 idk
[2022-12-19 04:21:36] <imillie_> maybe lower the odds of how many you can get with the dice?
[2022-12-19 04:21:37] <+TrumpetKing777> I mean threats don't work with a lot of other augments, so I think it's fair
[2022-12-19 04:21:38] <fergy123> just do it like double trouble and shit
[2022-12-19 04:21:38] <+navemai> The fact that he's anti-carry and usually one-shotting your back line is an issue.
[2022-12-19 04:21:43] <%1upstar> oh im glad i asked now i might get an odd free w every now and then :)
[2022-12-19 04:21:48] <%octopusoctopusoctopus> @emilyywang do you want to play https://www.tftdle.com/
[2022-12-19 04:21:48] <%AmandaMcCormick> Even if they just made threats have a % to show up instead of 100% chance.
[2022-12-19 04:21:48] <DaDevilsAdvocate> easy to criticize, harder to fix
[2022-12-19 04:21:52] <jamez28> If they decided that double trouble wouldnt work with threats neither should dice
[2022-12-19 04:21:59] <%kopio_> sorry we dont play tft Shruge
[2022-12-19 04:22:00] <brakiros> 2-1 Loaded Dice. Means at Lv4 you have a 0% chance to hit 4 costs. Lv5 is only 2% so at Lv5 you can pop like 3 dice and can super easily get a 3* Vel'koz or 3* Cho or 3* Rammus
[2022-12-19 04:22:03] <Franlesst> @jamez28 well no
[2022-12-19 04:22:07] <%kopio_> we are avid gartic and words on stream fans though

[2022-12-19 04:22:37] <%combofied> yeah I mean either no dice on 2-1 or you can't dice threats like you can't double trouble them
[2022-12-19 04:22:38] <%1upstar> threats undiceable makes sense because it's not even a synergy so why is it diceable
[2022-12-19 04:22:38] <%octopusoctopusoctopus> 4 cost threats suck but 3 costs are ok because they're reroll ok

[2022-12-19 04:33:59] <robotSabotage> he has a better insight tho lol. he's right in thinking that yummi wouldnt be a big threat lategame if it wasnt for mascot healing.
[2022-12-19 04:33:59] <%+Th1ccMike> mortdog thinks the unkillable mascot frontline is the main problem in the yuumi comp not yuumi herself

[2022-12-19 04:47:32] <freeburger> If someone contest you, is it either reset whole board or hope for them to go eif before you do?
[2022-12-19 04:47:58] <+navemai> @freeburger It's almost never pivot unless the game gives you the out naturally.

[2022-12-19 04:48:23] <%rafatito> oiling my way to the top ok
[2022-12-19 04:48:24] <+navemai> Sometimes you just have to know which units to play to conserve health/maintain a strong board and transition later.

[2022-12-19 04:49:00] <imillie_> Maybe Leona?
[2022-12-19 04:49:03] <+navemai> I think getting into the mindset that you should be forced off a comp because someone is high-rolling is a good way to just lower your placement.

[2022-12-19 04:49:27] <freeburger> @navemai damn. I feel like everyone plays the same builds and there are a bunch of units never used. I feel like there’s a build to counter very popular build that no one ever bothers figuring out

[2022-12-19 04:51:23] <+navemai> @freeburger Ultimately, sometimes you just need to know which units to play/comps that are feasible from your lobby position. Some games are play for first, some games are play for top 4.
[2022-12-19 04:51:31] <BazingaThatB> deadlyHey anneHeart

[2022-12-19 05:01:40] <bjoemmel> @astro_399 no problem. it doesn't really matter for 1costs or smth but 4costs/5costs it does make a "big" difference (should still do it for 1 costs for the best chances). also if every unit is out of the pool and you pick up the orb, you will get gold isntead

[2022-12-19 05:04:36] <bjoemmel> @reveritie not sure what you mean. set 7 had it's fair share of reroll comps aswell with Olaf/astral/volibearanivia etc.
[2022-12-19 05:04:36] <Vulpiia> i like that even if a comp is busted this set there’s usually an unconventional that can beat it
[2022-12-19 05:04:49] <%1upstar> i like supers as a reroll because it's strenght is like even more reliant on hitting so the possibility of other people being able to go it kinda balances it out

[2022-12-19 05:06:05] <Vulpiia> is it better to just not hacker hex someone most of the time?

[2022-12-19 05:06:49] <bjoemmel> @1upstar I dislike it due to the fact that it feels somewhat like dragon. you just put it in if you don't have any other units that would be good

[2022-12-19 05:14:19] <bjoemmel> @1upstar depends on what unit you wanna play. you can reroll as early as lvl 4 (you will only hit cho/vel/rammus)
[2022-12-19 05:14:40] <%kabgamma> xdd
[2022-12-19 05:14:42] <bjoemmel> which leads into winstreak -> you can go fast 8 and hit the other threats relatively easy

Fatty species are sometimes considered the healthiest. That’s because fatty fish, including salmon, trout, sardines, tuna, and mackerel, are higher in fat-based nutrients.

[2022-12-19 06:33:43] <playswitsquirrel> mort said it's not yuumi that's busted, it's mascots + supers
[2022-12-19 06:34:18] <wannytft> this asol is lit
[2022-12-19 06:34:38] <+BhorMS> zoe heart with battery is kinda nuts

[2022-12-19 06:35:08] <%+asla64> mort accidentally makes 1 good set for every 10 sets
[2022-12-19 06:35:10] <shrudyy> Both
[2022-12-19 06:35:11] <T0rio_> problem is that yuumi does way too much damage
[2022-12-19 06:35:15] <Franlesst> its super + yuumi xdd
[2022-12-19 06:35:25] <BenjiPeach> Maybe not mascots but galio specifically?

[2022-12-19 06:35:37] <+deenboiwastaken> he doesn't cast that much
[2022-12-19 06:35:48] <%KriTs> does anyone here thinks saying "set is balance" perma banable ? Mort placed 7th awhile ago then he said that it was frustrating that everyone is still alive at stage 5 when I said it. Then a mod perma banned me. Just want to ask if it rude because I honestly just want to compliment the game.
[2022-12-19 06:35:51] <T0rio_> velkoz is super toxic lol
[2022-12-19 06:35:56] <+BhorMS> @deenboiwastaken he benefits from zoe casts tho
[2022-12-19 06:36:04] <whiskyXsour> hate vel koz so much

[2022-12-19 06:36:04] <+lycheedeeznuts> @deenboiwastaken but he gets the bonus from everyone else
[2022-12-19 06:36:44] <+deenboiwastaken> @lycheedeeznuts I think only heart units cast give it to everyone
[2022-12-19 06:36:46] <@HatuBot> @KriTs depends on context but it might sound like ironic "game is balanced" Shruge
[2022-12-19 06:36:54] <T0rio_> @KriTs mods sometimes do random things without thinking
[2022-12-19 06:36:56] <ingenova1> if u hit a taliyah 2 in your shop randomly would you pivot to her
[2022-12-19 06:37:07] <@HatuBot> @KriTs couldn't be me hehe
[2022-12-19 06:37:07] <%Thug_Walrus> @KriTs Yeah, the mod probably thought you were being sarcastic/passive aggressive and if Mort was in a bad mood they might have banned you not to tilt him

[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <!%+Reveritie> reroll was put in the gutter
[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <%rafatito> you should say your opinion Shruge
[2022-12-19 07:23:32] <!%+Reveritie> and you played lvl 8 comps
[2022-12-19 07:23:34] <SicaChuu> i don't like unit augment, sometime you feel a aug down
[2022-12-19 07:23:36] <LeEpicBlob> there arent too many meme builds, other than zoomies nunu
[2022-12-19 07:23:37] <%melon_kingz> the more i play the more i dont like hero augment espeacilly the one that's just stat increase
[2022-12-19 07:23:37] <%+RimaLV2> Sell that worthless Draven Emily DinkDonk

[2022-12-19 07:24:10] <Franlesst> set 6/6.5 where reroll and non-reroll coexisted  frenn
[2022-12-19 07:24:24] <+eugeodone> does anyone know why cant i predict with channel points?
[2022-12-19 07:24:24] <%frankworthy> this set is reinforcing the idea of needing to stabilize before stage 4 because of increased player damage so more players play reroll i think
[2022-12-19 07:24:26] <blaykejames> I like Rammus
[2022-12-19 07:24:36] <ttb_778> @blaykejames ok

[2022-12-19 08:00:42] <SilverCord_AG> If you find yourself in the position between a spellslinger and heart crest, and going for the soraka line, always go for heart crest. From your position last game 4 heart units ulting repeatedly will  outscale spells linger by a long shot in a drawn out battle. just need hextech gunblade on soraka 2.

[2022-12-19 15:49:44] <%+LazloHo> Hi, my name is Lazlo and I'm a Supers Abuser. It first started about a week ago, when I heard "Yuumi is broken." I investigated and found this Mascot/Supers build that used Yuumi as a carry. I later learned it wasn't exactly Yuumi, you could use any carry. I tried the build, it was only supposed to be the once! But I won with it. It's been an insidious slide since then. I start each new game hoping to do something different but I see that Gangplank and I just can't stop myself.

[2022-12-19 16:23:08] <TruexOfficial> I like everything other than Hero Augments also, they are like 100% make or break RNG
[2022-12-19 16:23:09] <+Manaron> @y0usefatef with the lulu growth augment it is busted beyond belief
[2022-12-19 16:23:20] <+3g0_glitch> 2-1 augments….
[2022-12-19 16:23:22] <%+DougFrank> I think outside of jax and yuumi, they did a good job at balancing

[2022-12-19 16:23:29] <+3g0_glitch> 2-1 hero* augments..
[2022-12-19 16:23:29] <TruexOfficial> getting a bad Hero Augment as your 3rd = fast eif
[2022-12-19 16:23:31] <+WaterHerCropss> i think 2 star 5 costs need buffed a bit hmm

[2022-12-19 16:23:38] <+merosomal> @3g0_glitch agreege
[2022-12-19 16:23:53] <ATaCE578> are hero augments just bad because of the variance between them?

[2022-12-19 16:24:01] <+kkdj20> The only hero augments i have a problem with are the 1/2 cost carry augments, they basically require supers reroll whichi forces ppl to hold hands
