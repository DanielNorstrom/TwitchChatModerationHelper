[2023-01-10 21:58:53] <%Skython> Ok i found the solution, it was gsync/vsync related maxfps bug. - in-game, make sure to select the Fullscreen display option (so not borderless, or windowed). Now exit the game. - go to the install directory (by default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance) - make a new file called user.cfg, place it in the install directory - open the new file in notepad - write the following in the file: r_VSync = 0 sys_MaxFPS = 144 Set the MaxFPS to the rate of yo

[2023-01-10 22:00:14] <gnarus> so set render distance on grass to 0

[2023-01-10 22:00:34] <windowpuncher> I usually set fps to monitor refresh +10
[2023-01-10 22:00:34] <+whamer100> set max fps to 42069
[2023-01-10 22:00:39] <%SoulTea> if your max FPS infinity?
[2023-01-10 22:00:44] <@%Dawnyan> A second fix for this issue is to simply disable your g-sync via the NVIDIA Control Panel programme (possibly spelt wrong). Then simply enable the VSync via the in game settings. This will get rid of screen tearing and fix the main issue. You will be capped to 60 fps so the choice comes down to preference. Simply go to "Set up G-SYNC" on the left hand side, and once there un-check the box that's labelled "Set up G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible". Then click "Apply" (bottom right).
