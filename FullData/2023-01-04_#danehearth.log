[2023-01-04 02:42:31] <%+PrimoBrand> they didn't changed the corpse mechanic yet to other classes iirc
[2023-01-04 02:43:07] <%theSatyriceon> if he transforms, the whole corpses mehanix goes away?
[2023-01-04 02:43:54] <%+PrimoBrand> they said they would implement corpses as hidden for other classes, but I don't think it's up yet

[2023-01-04 21:12:46] <+TooTsaka> There's a version of a roller which has the swiftness of the carbon roller, and the splatting capabilities of the Dynamo roller. It's a fun one to use.
[2023-01-04 21:13:38] <+TooTsaka> It's called the Big Swig Roller.

[2023-01-04 21:15:19] <+TooTsaka> The splatfest starts this weekend. It's three teams against each other. I missed the other two because I didn't realise there's more to the splatfest than collecting  conch shells. Fml. NotLikeThis

[2023-01-04 21:34:22] <+TooTsaka> So it's literally better than any other option you have.

[2023-01-04 21:37:39] <+TooTsaka> That's the tracking. Doesn't lock them in place.

[2023-01-04 21:39:58] <+TooTsaka> The dynamo roller is hella awkward. Spreads in a large area and does tons of damage, but it's REALLY slow.

[2023-01-04 21:51:29] <+TooTsaka> The crucial thing about carbon roller: it doesn't one hit kill like the other roller does, so big downside there.
