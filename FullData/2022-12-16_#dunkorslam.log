[2022-12-16 08:12:07] <stellar_star_fall> fargos mod is an qol mod that adds an npc that sells you boss summons from bosses you have killed before
[2022-12-16 08:12:14] <%+quail_says_hi> fargos isnt necessary
[2022-12-16 08:12:16] <%+quail_says_hi> i dont think
[2022-12-16 08:12:18] <Naicii> @stellar_star_fall Sells boss bags but w.e
[2022-12-16 08:12:19] <%Viowlet> there's a toxic slime we haven't had

[2022-12-16 08:12:36] <Naicii> Also all boss summons in calamity are non-consumable so that doesn't matter
[2022-12-16 08:12:39] <stellar_star_fall> @Naicii i think theres an different npc (or different mod npc)
[2022-12-16 08:12:41] <xXenos> more mods! :D
[2022-12-16 08:12:41] <stellar_star_fall> thats*

[2022-12-16 08:13:39] <%BoleroOfDoots> probably to account for the border at the top
[2022-12-16 08:13:42] <Naicii> @stellar_star_fall Yeah the mutant mod adds the abomination, deviantt and the mutant who all sell summon items

[2022-12-16 08:14:01] <Naicii> @stellar_star_fall The better qol is that it adds recipes for banners and vanilla items

[2022-12-16 09:13:07] <%$myndzi> not guideline
[2022-12-16 09:13:15] <%$myndzi> NES tetris is just two players racing

[2022-12-16 09:13:32] <%$myndzi> you don't need it in other tetrises usually, because they have automatic movement speeds that are faster than NES

[2022-12-16 09:13:49] <%+shadowtimebb> that animation budget can't compensate for more game interaction

[2022-12-16 09:14:03] <%qirbeee> rolling? is that when you fit a block where it cant fit by rotating it last second?
[2022-12-16 09:14:08] <%$myndzi> there is even a technique where you flick fingers against the joystick to tap sideways quickly
[2022-12-16 09:14:08] <gekk_o> @DunkOrSlam Just saying that underground houses do suffer from ghosts more than aerial ones. In regular terraria.
[2022-12-16 09:14:16] <%DeriumEnvy> @myndzi You roll a piano on the cabinet? dnkAnime
[2022-12-16 09:14:17] <%$myndzi> @qirbeee that's a twist or spin

[2022-12-16 09:14:43] <%$myndzi> @qirbeee "rolling" is the technique for tapping left-right very fast by drumming your fingers against the back of the controller

[2022-12-16 09:15:31] <%$myndzi> just to clarify for chat, there are many different kinds of tetris. the one that gets all the attention online is the least interesting, but still interesting

[2022-12-16 09:18:35] <%KameradeKuhl> i think in normal terraria settings
[2022-12-16 09:18:48] <%$myndzi> the fastest tetris players in a completely unlimited game can play > 5 pieces per second
[2022-12-16 09:18:57] <%KameradeKuhl> I like hovered item query

[2022-12-16 09:19:02] <+iLordEx> wtf dunk doesn't have veinminer? what type of playthrough is this
[2022-12-16 09:19:08] <%$myndzi> NES tetris got popular as a "spectator" event because it's slow and simple enough to spectate / follow, more or less
[2022-12-16 09:19:15] <%qirbeee> lol mapped to mouse 1
[2022-12-16 09:19:26] <%KameradeKuhl> when you hover e.g. a sword it will show the recipe for that sword
[2022-12-16 09:19:32] <%Pagrax> @myndzi All my friends made fun of me for button mashing in fighting games. Turns out I was simply in the wrong genre.
[2022-12-16 09:19:34] <%qirbeee> oohhh my bad!
[2022-12-16 09:19:36] <%$myndzi> also it actually has good people behind promoting it, and making videos for people to understand stuff (like the gamescout video you saw)
[2022-12-16 09:19:41] <%$KiIIerBeeZ_> veinminer mod would be nice
[2022-12-16 09:19:48] <%+J4k51996> @DunkOrSlam Hovered item means when you hover over and press the bound key it shows the recipes available for the item
[2022-12-16 09:19:49] <%$myndzi> @Pagrax LUL they don't mash to get that fast, you can't
[2022-12-16 09:20:02] <%$myndzi> they just have really low timings and are really dialed in
[2022-12-16 09:20:02] <stellar_star_fall> does he actually not have oreexcavator?

[2022-12-16 09:21:05] <%$myndzi> microbliz uses like 4 frame das, meaning that the difference between moving to the left by 1 and moving all the way to the left wall is holding a key down < 4 frames at 60fps or >= 4 frames
[2022-12-16 09:21:09] <blodold> huh, what a weird mod for noita
[2022-12-16 09:21:30] <gekk_o> @myndzi that's insane

[2022-12-16 09:21:36] <%$myndzi> he also has near perfect finesse, which means that he uses the minimal number of inputs to put a piece in a position
[2022-12-16 09:21:47] <+iLordEx> dont burn your house down
[2022-12-16 09:21:51] <awesomazz> maybe because you're missing a block above the door?
[2022-12-16 09:21:55] <%Pagrax> @myndzi I want an eye tracker on that. Do they only look at new pieces or do they look at where they drop.
[2022-12-16 09:22:08] <%$myndzi> as well as being all around solid (he started out as a speed demon, but later got good in actual vs too)

[2022-12-16 09:33:58] <%tapshell> That's the best, yeah
[2022-12-16 09:34:03] <ArthurAshford> basic idea is: have all (or as many stations) available
[2022-12-16 09:34:04] <gekk_o> it's vanilla
[2022-12-16 09:34:10] <stellar_star_fall> @DunkOrSlam you don't need that if your running magic storage since magic storage can contain the crafting stations
[2022-12-16 09:34:11] <ArthurAshford> but it's vanilla
[2022-12-16 09:34:21] <+arbidon> this is unmodded, Magic Storage lets you have it all in a one unit system
[2022-12-16 09:34:21] <+iLordEx> magic storage has a multi crafting station

[2022-12-16 10:28:11] <gekk_o> Dunk, I think your gameplay still lacks some tactical building for now. If you learn this tricks, life may become easier. You may watch this to get the idea https://youtu.be/av94LVESNUQ?t=478
[2022-12-16 10:28:13] <Naicii> Remember for magic storage you want the green and blue ones

[2022-12-16 11:10:45] <+dusty_sprinkles> I feel like avatar is always over-rated cause its epic big bugdet cgi

[2022-12-16 11:11:22] <Vexilus_> James Cameron said he wanted to make Avatar films until he died allegedly
[2022-12-16 11:11:31] <%hollafu> vioSPIN vioSPIN vioSPIN
[2022-12-16 11:11:31] <%Chrawnus> Is there even a reason to see Avatar if you don't see it in 3D? It's not like any other aspect holds up on it's own jshibaDrPepper
[2022-12-16 11:11:33] <Naicii> This grappling hook is the most effective hook while caving, takes a little getting used to
[2022-12-16 11:11:40] <SectionTIC> Mining the unobtainium
[2022-12-16 11:11:43] <wwwwebster> He developed a new way to film underwater
[2022-12-16 11:11:48] <Vexilus_> @Sui_der_Eisbaer yea he wrote Avatar 2-4 all together, and I think they were all being filmed together too
[2022-12-16 11:11:54] <maghoy> in like 2012 they said avatar 2 would be in 2015, avatar 3 in 2016 etc all the way up to avatar 5... many years later the second one is *actually* out

[2022-12-16 11:14:06] <%Chrawnus> afaik, on rotten tomatoes, 95% just means 95% thought the movie didn't suck ass, so it could mean 95% thought it was slightly above average jshibaDrPepper
[2022-12-16 11:14:42] <%First_Mesmer> Pedals?  Like, the stream deck foot pedal thingy?  That honestly looks nifty!
[2022-12-16 11:14:44] <maghoy> in 3-D blow-D
[2022-12-16 11:14:51] <Naicii> It's a 1.4.4 thing
[2022-12-16 11:14:57] <%tw1stf> that works in the void bag but not in the pig i think
[2022-12-16 11:14:58] <WootHoop> Void bag
[2022-12-16 11:15:00] <%Talglys> That's the void bag
[2022-12-16 11:15:07] <Naicii> But I think one of Fargo's Mutant mod or Alchemist NPC lite thing also does that for you
[2022-12-16 11:15:15] <+dusty_sprinkles> all of the reviews just talk about it looking really pretty so I imagine the actual plot is mid
[2022-12-16 11:15:53] <%+Magaruis> @dusty_sprinkles I mean... The first story was already very meh.  The only way it can go is ; "the humans come back and the navi find a new thingymagick thing to kick them out"
[2022-12-16 11:16:11] <%tw1stf> thats the same reason why i imagine half life 3 will never release, the expectations are just so high they can never be satisfied no matter what there is
[2022-12-16 11:16:30] <wwwwebster> Depends on how much was kicked back to rotten tomatoes
[2022-12-16 11:16:44] <%+Magaruis> Need grass tiles
[2022-12-16 11:16:45] <superhello22> have you played around with the electronics much?
[2022-12-16 11:16:54] <%+Magaruis> Needs to be planted on grass blocks
[2022-12-16 11:16:58] <%+Arcade812> you can plant sunflowers anywhere but only on grass blocks
[2022-12-16 11:16:59] <%tw1stf> sunflowers need grass tiles and no background behind i think

[2022-12-16 11:18:29] <qaw_tr> Do you have any tips for beating the destroyer?
[2022-12-16 11:18:37] <Naicii> @qaw_tr Use nimbus cloud
[2022-12-16 11:18:50] <+dusty_sprinkles> any piercing weapon will destroy em
[2022-12-16 11:18:51] <Naicii> Destroyer big massive worm Jammies
[2022-12-16 11:18:54] <%+Arcade812> use any piercing weapons
[2022-12-16 11:18:54] <%DeriumEnvy> You deal damage to the boss until it dies.
[2022-12-16 11:19:01] <qaw_tr> Alr
[2022-12-16 11:19:09] <+Echo_Zer0> Beat him with jumper cables
[2022-12-16 11:19:17] <%Flupperich> The mechanical worm, yeah
[2022-12-16 11:19:18] <%Stick_X> Also, dodge.
[2022-12-16 11:19:19] <%+iRage2Win> destroyer is the worm that has many hit boxes
[2022-12-16 11:19:29] <%+Arcade812> when the destroyer spawns you can do incredible damage if you hit its tail - all of the segments spawn at one place
[2022-12-16 11:19:43] <Naicii> @qaw_tr I also assume you are playing vanilla
[2022-12-16 11:19:51] <%BryanTheYeti> bow from hallow mimic is good on him

[2022-12-16 11:24:56] <%tw1stf> @Flupperich Yeah i guess, but in terraria theres no distribution so you're just as likely to find them at the middle of the world as at the bottom
[2022-12-16 11:24:58] <+Tristan_Compton> @DunkOrSlam did you ever play starbound?
[2022-12-16 11:25:05] <%+Arcade812> amethyst looks a lot like rubies, but rubies have a slightly different texture and are more redder

[2022-12-16 11:31:27] <djlights1> I have a reverse bike helmet story - I stepped out into the road in front of a fast moving road\racing bike and he hit me full on.  Knocked me out cold, gave me a concussion.  the bike rider was OK because he was wearing a helmet when he flew over the handle bars.  I was like 5 or 6.  Still remember the moment I blacked out really vividly.

[2022-12-16 12:13:57] <%First_Mesmer> Municipal Broadband will get you decent internet speeds.  F the big ISP regional monopolies.
[2022-12-16 12:13:59] <%breaketh1> its not between big towns. maybe half an hour each way
[2022-12-16 12:14:14] <%Its_All_Gone_Wrong> Have you tried not exploding?

[2022-12-16 12:14:22] <%First_Mesmer> Pity that you won't get municipal broadband in a small town unless you've got local billionaires LUL
[2022-12-16 12:14:32] <+dusty_sprinkles> an american ISP would go out of their way to add new infrastructure at a lower up/down just to spite people
[2022-12-16 12:14:53] <winterofcreation> So in siberia village internet costs about 6x what we have in citties(usually 10$/month 100mb/s), but given rough terrain and difficulty with winter and all that is it understandable.

[2022-12-16 12:16:22] <%breaketh1> @DunkOrSlam the crazy thing is we have amazing internet but absolute shit phone service. i have Verizon and im on LTE most of the time.

[2022-12-16 12:17:22] [Points] WUOTE redeemed Deposit 1,000 Sweat (1 000) [that twitter auction, they got some pretty sweet things on sale like eames wooden chairs and whatnot]
[2022-12-16 12:17:33] <%First_Mesmer> Windowed mode Terraria?
[2022-12-16 12:17:35] <Naicii> What happened with the window
[2022-12-16 12:17:41] <%breaketh1> well verizon has wifi calling so its fine
[2022-12-16 12:18:09] <%+Mikeweber83> its basically mexico lol. you see more border patrol then locals almost along there
[2022-12-16 12:18:20] <%Flupperich> @breaketh1 Calling LTE "shit service" sounds so strange for me, we are lucky to get 3G out in the even slightly boonies of germany KEKWait
[2022-12-16 12:18:42] <%WUOTE> @dunkorslam you didnt read my DMs on dc
[2022-12-16 12:18:46] <+aliveindreams> @WUOTE can you link that or nah
[2022-12-16 12:19:03] <Naicii> I like the spawn mechanic of terraria but it really doesn't suit dunk's noita playstyle
[2022-12-16 12:19:04] <%zergextrem> thats because Germany has the internet level of avg Africa
[2022-12-16 12:19:11] <%breaketh1> @Flupperich i dont think lte is better than 3g. its basically in an emergency call only state.

[2022-12-16 12:22:38] <%Flupperich> @zergextrem At the very least do not be afraid of using the wiki ( terraria.wiki.gg ), there is way too much in this game to bother going fully blind.

[2022-12-16 12:24:37] <%+daflubbadubs> I think you meant to put it in the bottom corner of your chest and then just put it into the trash.
[2022-12-16 12:24:45] <Naicii> You probably dropped it where you last died

[2022-12-16 12:27:16] <Naicii> You need to beat the golbin army for tinkerer
[2022-12-16 12:27:28] <%Detuskified_Walrus> @Naicii like what weapon should dunk make next... maybe he can skip ahead to it
[2022-12-16 12:27:32] <%+daflubbadubs> just one. but he has to be found underground first after defeating a goblin army.
[2022-12-16 12:27:32] <%zergextrem> okay peeps, I go in Terraria now..... first unspoiled.... and if I get too much love from the game.... I'll read up on some guides.

[2022-12-16 12:32:17] <Naicii> Now you can make a new prosthesis

[2022-12-16 12:32:32] <djlights1> Dunk have you ever streamed a daily random challenge for Noita? today's both had glass canon, one with no tinkering and one with no wands in your inventory (but invisibility) there's usually 2  that kind of rotate out when I play it.
[2022-12-16 12:32:32] <+Blackspiral22> Can you guys not spam the chat please. I'm on my grandmoms laptop, and it gets really hot and burns my thighs when you spam the chat. thanks!

[2022-12-16 12:33:01] <%Detuskified_Walrus> another prosthesis costs 10 wulfrum scrap / 1 energy core
[2022-12-16 12:33:05] <Naicii> The console ver of Terraria was initially a port by a different team which is why it's stylized differently
[2022-12-16 12:33:19] <%First_Mesmer> But yeah, Terraria just didn't *feel* good to start playing blind.  Inventory back in the day was clunky, movement felt bad, building wasn't intuitive....  It's improved a LOT since then, plus a lot of it is the learning curve.
[2022-12-16 12:33:38] <%indoorcat_> I have a similar experience with Noita, first I bought it and was really bored with it because I didn't know anything and I refunded it. A few months later I go on a pirate ship and play noita and find it fun, so I buy noita again.
[2022-12-16 12:33:51] <+Blackspiral22> remember when you didnt autohop over blocks that were 1 high?

[2022-12-16 12:34:44] <%+daflubbadubs> piece of copper
[2022-12-16 12:34:57] <%Letaali> probably unobtainium, the most rare material in the game
[2022-12-16 12:35:01] <%tw1stf> @Blackspiral22 good times LUL
[2022-12-16 12:35:02] <Naicii> RANTING = enemies
[2022-12-16 12:35:22] <Naicii> The speedrunners have gotten damn close
[2022-12-16 12:35:23] <%WUOTE> @letaali jshibaSmile
[2022-12-16 12:35:47] <%tw1stf> isnt it like 1 minute 16 for set seed
[2022-12-16 12:36:02] <%Letaali> look at teleportless seeded @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-16 12:36:16] <WUOTE> Furys?
[2022-12-16 12:36:18] <Naicii> Wasn't Jay's teleportless wr was 1m50 or something right?
[2022-12-16 12:36:25] <%Letaali> teleportless is always to the work down below
[2022-12-16 12:36:28] <%tw1stf> thats teleportless then
[2022-12-16 12:36:28] <shyfly> how is daily practice different from normal run? Is it just set seed with unusual spawn and starting items?
[2022-12-16 12:36:52] <%Letaali> teleportless seeded is 1m 10s
[2022-12-16 12:36:55] <%Letaali> it goes to the work
[2022-12-16 12:37:13] <%WUOTE> @shyfly you can also replay it. Many times as you want
[2022-12-16 12:37:16] <%tw1stf> the angry ghost strat right
[2022-12-16 12:37:34] <+dusty_sprinkles> wow
[2022-12-16 12:37:36] <%Letaali> 10s faster and you get the pillar
[2022-12-16 12:37:39] <%WUOTE> Lets watch it
[2022-12-16 12:37:43] <+dusty_sprinkles> ^
[2022-12-16 12:37:56] <%WaxNumen> 10s is a lifetime at this level of optimization
[2022-12-16 12:38:00] <+Blackspiral22> i dont have all day Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:38:00] <%tw1stf> i can see the individual simulated pixels
[2022-12-16 12:38:05] <DerGolfa> Fury #9 Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:38:08] <%First_Mesmer> Does Teleportless count HM portals?
[2022-12-16 12:38:30] <%tw1stf> always cast perk
[2022-12-16 12:38:33] <%indoorcat_> Always cast
[2022-12-16 12:38:33] <Naicii> AC BH
[2022-12-16 12:38:34] <+dusty_sprinkles> Oh
[2022-12-16 12:38:35] <+dusty_sprinkles> wild
[2022-12-16 12:38:36] <%Letaali> the ac gives black hole
[2022-12-16 12:39:03] <Naicii> So the ac goes on wand 1 then he continuous casts wand 2
[2022-12-16 12:39:04] <%First_Mesmer> The game cares about the last spells he saw, so he spammed them then started a new game?
[2022-12-16 12:39:05] <%tw1stf> honestly theres still a lot of downtime when he hits blocks, im sure this could be shaved down to 1:00 or less
[2022-12-16 12:39:08] <%Letaali> nah he keeps firing black holes along the way
[2022-12-16 12:39:13] <%Letaali> the bomb is for later
[2022-12-16 12:39:15] <%Letaali> you will see
[2022-12-16 12:39:19] <%loup675> dunk be like limesBlink
[2022-12-16 12:39:21] <%First_Mesmer> Oh, I completely missed the AC Black Hole!
[2022-12-16 12:39:41] <%First_Mesmer> That is crazy!
[2022-12-16 12:39:47] <+Tristan_Compton> missed a heart up there, 8/10 run Kappa

[2022-12-16 12:39:48] <%WaxNumen> catJAM
[2022-12-16 12:39:54] <+dusty_sprinkles> a few pixels off from having a release the dragon run
[2022-12-16 12:40:25] <%Letaali> the bomb was for fast death
[2022-12-16 12:40:25] <%WUOTE> Good run
[2022-12-16 12:40:30] <%WUOTE> TETRISCHAMPION
[2022-12-16 12:40:32] <%RationalLies> idk, I can't see even this run being done in under a minute
[2022-12-16 12:40:36] <%Letaali> bomb + ac black hole = instantly dead
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <%tw1stf> easily lol
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <%First_Mesmer> Oh, the bomb is just to die asap LUL
[2022-12-16 12:40:44] <Naicii> He can 100% get faster
[2022-12-16 12:40:51] <Naicii> He gets stuck on a lot of terrain
[2022-12-16 12:40:52] <%DeriumEnvy> There's some minor optimizations that could be done for the travel to the boss
[2022-12-16 12:40:57] <+dusty_sprinkles> I think a few seconds could be shaved from terrain yeah
[2022-12-16 12:40:59] <%tw1stf> the strat is pretty optimized but he loses a lot of time mechanically
[2022-12-16 12:41:00] <%indoorcat_> Probably still a few seconds of optimisations though
[2022-12-16 12:41:01] <%RationalLies> he only loses 4-5 seconds
[2022-12-16 12:41:13] <%DeriumEnvy> Yeah, he hits terrain a lot
[2022-12-16 12:41:20] <%WUOTE> Not 10 sec
[2022-12-16 12:41:21] <%Letaali> yeah he slows down a few times while falling
[2022-12-16 12:41:32] <%tw1stf> man i literally did a surface work run that was 24 seconds long and i could still shave 2 seconds with optimizations
[2022-12-16 12:41:33] <%Letaali> but for 10s save, you would need more
[2022-12-16 12:41:33] <%indoorcat_> Idk if it's 10s worth though
[2022-12-16 12:41:36] <%tw1stf> this has like 15 seconds to save

[2022-12-16 12:41:44] <%WaxNumen> I don't see how you could lower this by 10 seconds without teleports or something

[2022-12-16 12:42:07] <%+daflubbadubs> faster mines would have to be the only way right?
[2022-12-16 12:42:10] <%DeriumEnvy> Every single time you bump into the terrain your momentum stops and your falling needs to accelerate again
[2022-12-16 12:42:11] <%tw1stf> in fact i'll try to go for a sub 1 on this seed
[2022-12-16 12:42:11] <%Letaali> yeah if this wasn't teleportless, then maybe you could hit the HM teleportatium eyes to speed up

[2022-12-16 12:43:24] <%Letaali> the blue wand got the AC black hole, he fires it, then the empty bomb wand will make the angry ghost fire, even tho the wand shoots nothing

[2022-12-16 12:44:27] <%Letaali> for the event, you could try the speedrun pillars in a separate daily practice run, if you allow the event to be multiple runs
[2022-12-16 12:44:30] <%WUOTE> I think bonfire or fury could improve that time by 6-7 seconds at most
[2022-12-16 12:44:34] <%Letaali> then one run could be a nightmare win too

[2022-12-16 12:45:26] <%First_Mesmer> I watched someone learn to play Rimworld for a while.  The number of *days* it took for them to learn about flooring and it's benefits LUL
[2022-12-16 12:45:26] <djlights1> i usually have 2 different daily practice that can spawn seems kind of random is that normal?

[2022-12-16 12:45:54] <%Letaali> same as daily run, it sometimes sends you to the wrong one

[2022-12-16 12:56:13] <%tw1stf> @DunkOrSlam I tried the seed from the speedrun, its the same seed with the same perks and wands, but for some reason the AC gives me energy orb with timer instead of black hole, any idea whats up with that? (applying AC on the same wand as WR)
[2022-12-16 12:56:17] <%WaxNumen> We need to stop adding more games to his plate, he still needs to play Rimworld Smadge
[2022-12-16 12:56:18] <%+Magaruis> Idk about high on life.  I saw a few people play it.  It seems very hit or miss.  If you weren't into Rick and Morty , it was meh.
[2022-12-16 12:56:32] <Almostnearly> 2000 was 10 years ago Clueless
[2022-12-16 12:56:44] <Divineoverseer> Does he know
[2022-12-16 12:56:46] <%WUOTE> @tw1stf might be the unlocks you have or might have been pre-patch?
[2022-12-16 12:56:59] <%WUOTE> 99% its your unlocks
[2022-12-16 12:57:06] <Divineoverseer> We're caught in a TIME LOOP
[2022-12-16 12:57:14] <$GlacialRelic> "The chain has never been broken, not once, not in fourteen centuries. Not since we Elders began leapfrogging through time." AWARE
[2022-12-16 12:57:16] <%tw1stf> @WUOTE It should be the april 23 build, it says that on speedrun.com, and the only item i need is black hole
[2022-12-16 12:57:20] <%+Magaruis> You are forgetting Fifa "insert current year here"
[2022-12-16 12:57:27] <%WUOTE> Noitool @tw1stf check what it should give
[2022-12-16 12:57:36] <Naicii> Downwards
[2022-12-16 12:57:51] <Cloud_Bacon> yay I just got lucky and found two diamond crawlers in a row, my magic storage can begin lolipHype
[2022-12-16 12:58:09] <%+Magaruis> It is used for special crafting
[2022-12-16 12:58:10] <%ItsTheFrank> makes ice?
[2022-12-16 12:58:10] <Naicii> It makes ice themed furniture
[2022-12-16 12:58:13] <Divineoverseer> It's not a nice machine
[2022-12-16 12:58:15] <%+daflubbadubs> makes ice furniture
[2022-12-16 12:58:16] <%RationalLies> ice furniture
[2022-12-16 12:58:17] <Cloud_Bacon> a crafting station for mostly furniture
[2022-12-16 12:58:19] <%tw1stf> @WUOTE ohh you're right, its not regular BH, its bh with death trigger so it has to be an unlock, but weirdly i'm almost sure i have that one already dnkHuh
[2022-12-16 12:58:29] <%tw1stf> @WUOTE https://noita-tools.herokuapp.com/?seed=1570392258
[2022-12-16 12:58:33] <Naicii> You can upgrade the snowball cannon so dont worry about it's prefix
[2022-12-16 12:58:42] <%WUOTE> @tw1stf https://www.noitool.com/
[2022-12-16 12:58:48] <Naicii> Nono you need sand, why'd you bin it
[2022-12-16 12:58:49] <%+daflubbadubs> snowball weapon is actually decent in the early game if i recall.
[2022-12-16 12:59:02] <m3thew> apparently, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is about to dethrone elden holes as best-selling game of the year
[2022-12-16 12:59:07] <%Ravenkorpse> get them gems
[2022-12-16 12:59:11] <Naicii> !bruh don't bin sand from now on, you need sand
[2022-12-16 12:59:12] <%zebeteus> !quack duckstatue!
[2022-12-16 12:59:41] <%+Magaruis> !quack
[2022-12-16 12:59:50] <%WUOTE> @tw1stf afaik if you dont have all unlocks it skews the outcome bonfire had that issue on one seed
[2022-12-16 13:00:49] <ligerzerof> dunkorslam zenith seed when Kappa
[2022-12-16 13:00:50] <%WUOTE> Letaali probably has a proper explanation
[2022-12-16 13:00:50] <%RationalLies> @WUOTE I can confirm this
[2022-12-16 13:00:51] <%Letaali> I was pinged, what's up
[2022-12-16 13:00:52] <Naicii> 1 more emerald and sapphire, 2 more diamonds
[2022-12-16 13:00:52] <%tw1stf> @WUOTE ahh thats weird but it would explain why that happens, thanks for clarifying, it might be related to why i dont "have" earthquake and stuff unlcoked
[2022-12-16 13:01:24] <%tw1stf> @Letaali the speedrun seed has AC BH with death trigger. I'm confident I have that one unlocked, but it still gives me the wrong spell
[2022-12-16 13:01:27] <Naicii> Zenith seed is not for old people who can't see
[2022-12-16 13:01:33] <Naicii> no offense
[2022-12-16 13:01:35] <%WUOTE> @letaali twist doesnt get BH on the WR seed as AC, why, cause he doent have all the unlocks?
[2022-12-16 13:01:42] <djlights1> everyone i've seen play zenith so far just cheeses around all over the place and i couldn't keep watching
[2022-12-16 13:01:45] <Almostnearly> offence taken Smadge
[2022-12-16 13:01:45] <%Letaali> black hole is not an unlock
[2022-12-16 13:01:46] <%22ttmes> howdy nerds dnkYo
[2022-12-16 13:02:02] <%+Arcade812> i have over 1000 hours in terraria and still die every 10 minutes
[2022-12-16 13:02:14] <%Letaali> but if your tier 6 projectile spells list has some unlock missing, that does change the result
[2022-12-16 13:02:28] <cafce25> is your shift key broken?
[2022-12-16 13:02:59] <%tw1stf> @Letaali ahh dnkNoted oh yeah, i have a bug where i dont have basic unlocks like earthquake even tho i picked the orb in like 2019, would you know what could be up with that?
[2022-12-16 13:03:04] <Naicii> Ironically enough the zenith seed's playstyle rewards a passive ranting stlye that avoids all the enemies
[2022-12-16 13:03:12] <@%DunkBot> In 5min !iloveyou will become spammable command for 20s, feel free to use that as opportunity to show dnkLove
[2022-12-16 13:03:21] <Naicii> Spear
[2022-12-16 13:03:23] <Naicii> You have a spear
[2022-12-16 13:03:41] <m3thew> not even a sweat EZ
[2022-12-16 13:03:44] <+Poquito_Mal> !quack
[2022-12-16 13:03:50] <cafce25> cause you drag'n' drop the items instead of shift clicking
[2022-12-16 13:03:55] <%Letaali> @Letaali couple other people have had the same issue, the flag for the spell is missing, but since the save remembers the orb, you no longer can unlock it
[2022-12-16 13:03:59] <DominusCruor> craft a fireplace if you can for extra healing
[2022-12-16 13:04:01] <%Letaali> you can fix this with 2 methods
[2022-12-16 13:04:07] <Naicii> Who wins in a fight? A guy who is armored to stop up to 9mm, or a guy with a 9mm pistol.
[2022-12-16 13:04:32] <%WUOTE> Yes @naicii
[2022-12-16 13:04:52] <+dusty_sprinkles> that grapple is pretty weird yeah
[2022-12-16 13:05:00] <Naicii> Ever jumped in cold water dunk?
[2022-12-16 13:05:00] <%Flupperich> You suffocate faster in ice water in Calamity
[2022-12-16 13:05:01] <MachMinotaur> ot
[2022-12-16 13:05:10] <MachMinotaur> it's a mechanic in calamity
[2022-12-16 13:05:14] <%peterce3> What grapple is that
[2022-12-16 13:05:23] <%Flupperich> Replaced the really annoying movementspeed slow from Vanilla
[2022-12-16 13:05:25] <%Letaali> either go to save00/persistent/orbs_new and remove the ID for the earthquake orb. Or add the flag for EQ unlock. "card_unlocked_crumbling_earth" @tw1stf
[2022-12-16 13:05:25] <%+daflubbadubs> can we use the snow gat for a change of pace and better dps?
[2022-12-16 13:05:58] <%tw1stf> @Letaali NOTED okay, i can do that, i think i've read that somewhere else before but forgot to go through it, thanks for the help
[2022-12-16 13:06:37] <Naicii> emeralds POGGIES
[2022-12-16 13:06:55] <%Flupperich> iirc you can also rever the ice water thing back to vanilla in calamity settings
[2022-12-16 13:06:58] <%Flupperich> if you prefer that
[2022-12-16 13:07:02] <Naicii> Please stop using the gun in melee range when you have a spear
[2022-12-16 13:07:21] <%+carniera> like shootin' slimes in a barrel
[2022-12-16 13:08:14] <Naicii> need 1 sapphire and 2 diamonds
[2022-12-16 13:08:25] <cafce25> But ranged is all he knows Kappa
[2022-12-16 13:08:26] <%Soler> ewww
[2022-12-16 13:08:28] <Naicii> Amythyst topaz rubies are used for storage upgrades
[2022-12-16 13:08:51] <Naicii> @cafce25 Weapon is technically a mage weapon since it uses mana
[2022-12-16 13:08:55] <PuffieDane> if you need a lot more gems it's probably smart to grow gemtrees
[2022-12-16 13:08:55] <Naicii> Need 1 sapphire
[2022-12-16 13:09:03] <%WUOTE> Daa at 144
[2022-12-16 13:09:03] <Naicii> you got 2 diamonds
[2022-12-16 13:09:21] <cafce25> there is another one i think
[2022-12-16 13:09:22] <DominusCruor> another diamond
[2022-12-16 13:09:24] <%Talglys> one more
[2022-12-16 13:09:26] <%Chillaxxo> those noita mods change the game too much
[2022-12-16 13:09:26] <Naicii> Now just need 1 sapphire
[2022-12-16 13:09:38] <m3thew> whats ur stance on spoilers? @DunkOrSlam or do u know wat a shadow diamond is?
[2022-12-16 13:09:41] <%Detuskified_Walrus> 144 holy shit
[2022-12-16 13:09:44] <%Flupperich> Yes
[2022-12-16 13:09:44] <MachMinotaur> yes
[2022-12-16 13:09:45] <Naicii> Yes
[2022-12-16 13:09:47] <%Flupperich> Acorn
[2022-12-16 13:09:51] <PuffieDane> that's vanilla terarria
[2022-12-16 13:09:51] <Naicii> Was introduced in 1.4
[2022-12-16 13:09:53] <%Flupperich> Acorn + Gem
[2022-12-16 13:09:54] <%breaketh1> gemcorns
[2022-12-16 13:09:57] <%RationalLies> !piss
[2022-12-16 13:10:02] <%Ultimhate> !quack
[2022-12-16 13:10:03] <%+Arcade812> combine an acorn with a gem and plant it underground on stone
[2022-12-16 13:10:03] <%Flupperich> Then plant it underground on rock
[2022-12-16 13:10:06] <DominusCruor> generally not worth
[2022-12-16 13:10:09] <%+Arcade812> not very great returns, very very slow
[2022-12-16 13:10:10] <astro_gaming> has to be in the caverns i believe
[2022-12-16 13:10:10] <PuffieDane> they only grow undergound tho
[2022-12-16 13:10:15] <Naicii> It's worth to make one then wait for it to harvest
[2022-12-16 13:10:18] <cafce25> take the extra diamond
[2022-12-16 13:10:18] <%breaketh1> depends on how big you make your horticulture orchard
[2022-12-16 13:10:19] <cafce25> ?
[2022-12-16 13:10:20] <%Flupperich> Very slow return on actual gems
[2022-12-16 13:10:22] <%peterce3> It's just for money in vanilla
[2022-12-16 13:10:43] <m3thew> do u know wat a shadow diamond is?
[2022-12-16 13:10:48] <%breaketh1> the returns could be thousands og gems but it take a bit to set up
[2022-12-16 13:11:01] <%+Arcade812> theres a chance gem trees dont drop any gems at all
[2022-12-16 13:11:16] <Naicii> yeah sometimes gem trees only drop the gemcorn
[2022-12-16 13:11:18] <DominusCruor> there was one left in previous diamond group
[2022-12-16 13:11:23] <%+daflubbadubs> as long as you're beating out 6% roi yearly then you're winning against inflation so gem tree = good investment
[2022-12-16 13:11:24] <cafce25> him missing the one diamond on the first spot kills me LUL
[2022-12-16 13:11:31] <lip_hooder> now do a diamond pickaxe
[2022-12-16 13:11:32] <%breaketh1> no its not kinda like that at all
[2022-12-16 13:11:33] <Naicii> chlorophyll

[2022-12-16 13:13:38] <Naicii> Beeg
[2022-12-16 13:14:01] <PuffieDane> it's important to note that gemtrees don't grow in front of player placed walls
[2022-12-16 13:14:09] <%breaketh1> @DunkOrSlam you can watch this on 2x speed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAFeIkK5m0s
[2022-12-16 13:14:17] <%breaketh1> he explains it slow
[2022-12-16 13:14:18] <Naicii> I think you need to hold a key to jump
[2022-12-16 13:14:28] <DominusCruor> double jump?
[2022-12-16 13:14:32] <+ailoops> @dunkorslam Imagine if you could play Minä in Terraria… Now that would be an awesome mod. Soler is making it, riiight @soler? slrTilt
[2022-12-16 13:14:32] <Naicii> Just pressing jump just drops you off?
[2022-12-16 13:14:50] <Naicii> Oh, try holding the jump key
[2022-12-16 13:15:06] <Naicii> You jump higher if you hold jump key
[2022-12-16 13:15:09] <%tw1stf> @Letaali sorry for bothering, but I noticed i don't have thundercloud (and probably other easy orbs) either, do you know where i can find the list of card_unlocked file names?
[2022-12-16 13:15:23] <%Velgadis> does it reset the double jump?
[2022-12-16 13:15:26] <%breaketh1> read me, 1 minute of your time plz sir
[2022-12-16 13:15:27] <%DeriumEnvy> Sounds like a skill issue to me
[2022-12-16 13:15:35] <%MiczuPL> Sounds like a skill issue to me
[2022-12-16 13:15:43] <%nolava> Sounds like a skill issue to me
[2022-12-16 13:15:47] <Naicii> You need to hold the jump key dunk
[2022-12-16 13:15:49] <Naicii> Not tap it
[2022-12-16 13:16:04] <Naicii> Tapping jump drops you off the grapple
[2022-12-16 13:16:33] <%breaketh1> read me, 1 minute of your time plz sir
[2022-12-16 13:16:41] <%Letaali> @tw1stf not sure if those are listed on wiki, but "card_unlocked_cloud_thunder" is what you want
[2022-12-16 13:17:09] <%breaketh1> its on topic
[2022-12-16 13:17:16] <%breaketh1> why would i link random shit
[2022-12-16 13:17:19] <%+daflubbadubs> gem tree farm tutorial
[2022-12-16 13:17:21] <+ailoops> aka  playing the noita character in Terraria would be awesome… I have to ask the Nolla guys to do it
[2022-12-16 13:18:03] <%+RNGrizzly> 2 minute video, time for Dunk to pause and skip 50 times and rant for 10 minutes, rather than just watching it
[2022-12-16 13:18:24] <%breaketh1> it will auto plant 3 blocks apart @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-16 13:18:38] <%RationalLies> @tw1stf not 100% sure if I have all unlocked, but I can dm my list to you if you want.
[2022-12-16 13:18:40] <%tw1stf> @tw1stf Perfect, thanks!! After adding those two, I now get the death trigger BH from the AC in the seed. The only thing I'm curious about now is if I'm still missing some spells
[2022-12-16 13:18:46] <%Flupperich> It's just crafting Acorn + Gem you want to make a Gemcorn of
[2022-12-16 13:19:01] <%breaketh1> thats old info
[2022-12-16 13:19:08] <%breaketh1> stained glass is shit now
[2022-12-16 13:19:12] <Naicii> Btw stained glass has been nerfed
[2022-12-16 13:19:12] <%tw1stf> @RationalLies that would be awesome
[2022-12-16 13:19:13] <%RationalLies> stained doesn't sell well anymore
[2022-12-16 13:19:19] <%breaketh1> right
[2022-12-16 13:19:20] <%Ultimhate> It's staggering how much has changed in this game since release
[2022-12-16 13:19:33] <%DeriumEnvy> Stained glass has been nerfed? But has it been nerfed on this version?
[2022-12-16 13:19:57] <%breaketh1> big points are 22 blocks high and spaces 3 blocks.
[2022-12-16 13:20:04] <%Talglys> is it because you were standing in water?
[2022-12-16 13:20:23] <%breaketh1> any gem you have you can make it into a gemcorn
[2022-12-16 13:20:42] <%tealisu> dunk raid nasa today Kappa
[2022-12-16 13:20:43] <Naicii> Make the green one
[2022-12-16 13:20:44] <Naicii> For now
[2022-12-16 13:20:57] <Naicii> That way you can start storing things
[2022-12-16 13:21:05] <AndreTheGodKiller> can you build a hotdog
[2022-12-16 13:21:26] <Naicii> Hotdog drops from some enemies somewhere idk where tho @AndreTheGodKiller
[2022-12-16 13:21:43] <%Flupperich> Lead and Iron are equivalent
[2022-12-16 13:21:44] <%Flupperich> You can interchange as you want
[2022-12-16 13:21:47] <Naicii> you need both lead and silver to make the storage system
[2022-12-16 13:21:51] <%Flupperich> just not use them both at the same time
[2022-12-16 13:21:54] <AndreTheGodKiller> bad game cant make hotdogs 0/10
[2022-12-16 13:23:46] <Naicii> And you need chests
[2022-12-16 13:23:52] <Naicii> Make 5 or 6 of those plain things
[2022-12-16 13:23:54] <Naicii> Make 4 into storage units
[2022-12-16 13:23:55] <%$DragonfaceX> Oh shit, Terraria.
[2022-12-16 13:23:55] <Naicii> And then the other 2 turn into the blue and green
[2022-12-16 13:23:56] <Abwasser> alkNose
[2022-12-16 13:23:56] <Naicii> Storage units are 10 silver and a chest each
[2022-12-16 13:23:57] <%breaketh1> i ran across a facebook marketplace deal for a ton of hardwood. oak, maple, birch, walnut and cherry all mixed together for $1 a board. bought 2 trailer loads of it. stay tuned for some cool creations :P @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-16 13:23:59] <%$DragonfaceX> I haven't caught a Terraria stream before
[2022-12-16 13:24:01] <Naicii> Yes but well worth it
[2022-12-16 13:24:01] <PuffieDane> you can upgrade the storage units later with different recources
[2022-12-16 13:24:01] <manceybear> AndreTheGodKiller yeah but you cant kill gods with hotdogs no matter how good they are Kappa
[2022-12-16 13:24:03] <Naicii> I think you can make 4 with the silver you have right now
[2022-12-16 13:24:07] <%$DragonfaceX> It's all good, I've barely played the game, tho it's fun.
[2022-12-16 13:24:10] <Naicii> all the other ones are QoL, the calamity mod is the only content mod
[2022-12-16 13:24:10] <AndreTheGodKiller> @manceybear they just need to be good enough hotdogs maybe put some posion in it and make the gods eat it
[2022-12-16 13:24:13] <Abwasser> @AndreTheGodKiller there are actually hotdogs in the game.. atleast without mods
[2022-12-16 13:24:14] <%Flupperich> RecipeBroser
[2022-12-16 13:24:48] <runnez> Magic storage? recipe browser?
[2022-12-16 13:24:50] <manceybear> AndreTheGodKiller touche!
[2022-12-16 13:25:04] <PuffieDane> could be worth it
[2022-12-16 13:25:05] <runnez> @Naicii i mean i would say that magic storage is a content mod and a QoL mod
[2022-12-16 13:25:05] <%breaketh1> i bought 1100 boards on average 5 inches wide 9 ft long
[2022-12-16 13:25:05] <faike101> probably yes
[2022-12-16 13:25:08] <%loup675> yes, it's very worth it planting gems
[2022-12-16 13:25:31] <PuffieDane> just combine one sapphire with a gem
[2022-12-16 13:25:39] <PuffieDane> the tree drops more gemcorns
[2022-12-16 13:25:42] <%breaketh1> man hardwood like that is usually about $4 a board foot. i paid fractions of its worth
[2022-12-16 13:25:54] <Naicii> Make 1 gemcorn, plant it underground
[2022-12-16 13:25:57] <Naicii> Then wait
[2022-12-16 13:25:59] <%$DragonfaceX> I recently got into epoxy resin and that's expensive, but even then, I shudder at the thought of woodworking due to costs.
[2022-12-16 13:26:04] <PuffieDane> acorn yes
[2022-12-16 13:26:10] <Naicii> Although it'd be faster to just find 1 sapphire imho or to find an extractinator
[2022-12-16 13:26:24] <AndreTheGodKiller> i wanted to build myself a shed turning covid and it would have cost me a arm and both legs luckily i knew a guy who sold me some wood at a more normal price
[2022-12-16 13:26:28] <Naicii> You are probably going to find 1 sapphire faster than the gemtree will grow
[2022-12-16 13:27:11] <PuffieDane> its the cavern layer, so when the dirt background walls start to disappear it should be low enough?
[2022-12-16 13:27:18] <%breaketh1> 2x4's went up to $8 each. typical price would be about $2.50
[2022-12-16 13:27:26] <%breaketh1> luckily its come back down now
[2022-12-16 13:27:27] <Naicii> @DunkOrSlam Planting it at the bottom of your shaft where the minecart is should be fine
[2022-12-16 13:27:30] <%+Magaruis> Just build your house out of gold... Checkmate !
[2022-12-16 13:27:41] <%loup675> @DunkOrSlam just be sure to have 17 blocks up when planting gemcorns underground and you're good
[2022-12-16 13:27:56] <%breaketh1> there was a point where steel was cheaper than wood @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-16 13:27:58] <%$DragonfaceX> @breaketh1 Oh has it? Hmmm...I only got into epoxy BECAUSE wood was so expensive...maybe I'll have to try it out.
[2022-12-16 13:28:00] <AndreTheGodKiller> it isnt that nature is healing more like people stopped being so greedy
[2022-12-16 13:28:04] <%loup675> limesBlind
[2022-12-16 13:28:35] <PuffieDane> place them on stone
[2022-12-16 13:28:37] <%TrebuchetRockets> @breaketh1 full sheets were like $60
[2022-12-16 13:28:37] <+Tristan_Compton> wood uh finds a way
[2022-12-16 13:28:54] <Naicii> @DunkOrSlam Make the storage units now with silver and chests
[2022-12-16 13:29:05] <Naicii> You can make 4
[2022-12-16 13:29:07] <AndreTheGodKiller> people gonna start pricing air at 2 dollars a breath
[2022-12-16 13:29:07] <Naicii> You have 116 silver right there
[2022-12-16 13:29:10] <%breaketh1> @TrebuchetRockets as in it was cheaper to build a pole barn house than a wood house. after all was said and done.
[2022-12-16 13:29:16] <Naicii> 116 silver is 29 bars
[2022-12-16 13:29:17] <Abwasser> incase you didnt know, you can rename the chests, and if you just hover over them with mouse it tells you the named text (makes it easier to find the right chest :p )
[2022-12-16 13:29:17] <%TrebuchetRockets> ya, nutty
[2022-12-16 13:29:19] <PuffieDane> if you hit ctrl the game will place the gemcorns at the right distance apart from each other
[2022-12-16 13:29:22] <Naicii> Now you just gotta empty and grab some chests
[2022-12-16 13:29:34] <Naicii> !anta need chests
[2022-12-16 13:29:35] <%TrebuchetRockets> glad i finished my reno’s BEFORE
[2022-12-16 13:29:59] <$Walnut60> !quack
[2022-12-16 13:30:03] <Naicii> Then just place them connected to the green thing
[2022-12-16 13:30:18] <Naicii> They need to be connected to the green one
[2022-12-16 13:30:18] <%breaketh1> @TrebuchetRockets during that time i decided to buy a commercial building and turn it into my home. i also put 4 apaerments up stairs in the meatime.
[2022-12-16 13:30:25] <Naicii> @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-16 13:30:27] <%breaketh1> apartments*
[2022-12-16 13:30:36] <Naicii> only 1
[2022-12-16 13:30:37] <PuffieDane> only one needs to touch
[2022-12-16 13:30:40] <Naicii> you can chain them
[2022-12-16 13:30:45] <MachMinotaur> they can be daisy chained it's fine
[2022-12-16 13:30:49] <%TrebuchetRockets> nice! residual income, best
[2022-12-16 13:30:50] <PuffieDane> but i think you need one more part?
[2022-12-16 13:30:56] <Naicii> So if you have 1 touching green which touches another in a link they all touch
[2022-12-16 13:31:19] <Naicii> Keep in mind it's 160 UNIQUE items
[2022-12-16 13:31:32] <Abwasser> yea the crafting one
[2022-12-16 13:31:34] <Naicii> if you have like 1000 wood
[2022-12-16 13:31:38] <Naicii> It will count as 1 item
[2022-12-16 13:31:42] <%+DeepFriedNutzz> some items
[2022-12-16 13:31:49] <PuffieDane> you can put crafting stations in a special component and use the storage system to craft everything you need
[2022-12-16 13:31:57] <Naicii> @PuffieDane He needs the blue one first
[2022-12-16 13:32:04] <%+DeepFriedNutzz> yes
[2022-12-16 13:32:09] <Naicii> Weapons will be stackable if they have the same reforge
[2022-12-16 13:32:24] <%+DeepFriedNutzz> I believe different reforges will have different stacks
[2022-12-16 13:34:01] <Naicii> Now you just empty everything but the gemcorn into it :)
[2022-12-16 13:34:04] <%breaketh1> @TrebuchetRockets well so far it has been a money sink, but im still well under what i would have paid for a replacement house after mine burned down. the only thing about the building that is costing me money at this point is renovations. all bills are paying for themselves plus i am living "free"
[2022-12-16 13:34:08] <%Detuskified_Walrus> was eating did u make new robo gat yet? :)
