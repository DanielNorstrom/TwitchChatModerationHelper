[2022-12-16 20:25:53] <KimetsuNoYa1ba> Well prepping in my opinion is to stock up goods which you can store and then grow yourself. Otherwise you wont last in the long run :P even ammo will eventually run out cause the resources would become more scarces

[2022-12-16 20:59:40] <!%$ethan8855> Real GenZ behavior from Trey all because he didn't get invited to the secret discord and streamer meeting @Trey24k
[2022-12-16 20:59:40] <Fartin__Scorsese> they dont care about streamers, they care about sales.  sometimes those happen to intersect
[2022-12-16 20:59:40] <%madmanritz95> wipe is a myth just like the female bussy
[2022-12-16 20:59:48] <%shanedoc> and tigz liked every second of it
[2022-12-16 20:59:49] <goldendragon11> Tigz needs it

[2022-12-16 21:00:06] <%CardiacArrest__> Like Nikitas answers are typically “get fucked for trying to enjoy our game”
[2022-12-16 21:00:09] <%bosshaug12> its rumored he's going to make himself look exactly like gluhar
[2022-12-16 21:00:12] <+fluffysheep357> lol
