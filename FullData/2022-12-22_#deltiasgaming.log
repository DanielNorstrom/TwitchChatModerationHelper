[2022-12-22 00:10:38] <%D_I_X_0_N> eso combat def spoils us when it works
[2022-12-22 00:11:00] <!%nyxenwhite> Nothing compares to eso combat, so its hard to fall in love with another mmo imo
[2022-12-22 00:11:08] <%D_I_X_0_N> lost ark spoiled most top down for me if u cant dodge sprint and jump then im out lol
[2022-12-22 00:11:15] <!%nyxenwhite> Tab target is just too snoozy for me
[2022-12-22 00:11:31] <!%nyxenwhite> True, NW’s combat is pretty good

[2022-12-22 00:16:44] <!%nyxenwhite> Alot of ppl criticizing NW end game, but they gotta understand its still new. You can compare it to monster games like WoW and eso. ESO at launch was rouugghh. I think NW will grow into something nice
[2022-12-22 00:16:47] <goggsthebones> Farmed up my magblade but still run low on sustain and struggling to solo wb and over lands stuff
[2022-12-22 00:16:47] <%NebTex_> Plus like you’ve said before, you can pretty much do whatever you want right off the bat in eso
[2022-12-22 00:17:15] <%D_I_X_0_N> is BDO combat better then ESO ive heard from multiple people it is??
[2022-12-22 00:18:15] <@%$arctic_bombsicle> I tried bdo it was ok
