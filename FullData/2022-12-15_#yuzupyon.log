Asking people permission before hugging was all right during photo-taking. However, while I was trying to finish taking photos of the Anime Merches on my final day, some lady at the vendor's desk had falsely said I made her feel uncomfortable KNOWING THAT I DID NOT!!! She had complained to staff, and sent the temporary head of security to me and asked me to leave. 😭😭😭😭😭
