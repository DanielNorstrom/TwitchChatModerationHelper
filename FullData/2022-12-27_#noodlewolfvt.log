[2022-12-27 21:17:44] <@%bakeup> So the best engravings for Deadeye are expensive for sure since hes a DPS. But I think Hitmaster - Keen Blunt - Adrenaline - grudge if you are okay with taking more damage - cursed doll if you are okay with healing less - Spirit Absoprption is also good and not as expensive :0
[2022-12-27 21:17:57] <TheGreatZalgo> Speedos is like the male equivalent of a lingerie.

[2022-12-27 21:18:46] <%+wulfrayne849> something I also find annoying is big boobs = sexual, like what about people that naturally just have a big chest and can't really do anything about it?

[2022-12-27 21:20:02] <%dracohawkps4> Oh God, I'm reminded of the "sexualized" argument from the Uzaki anime

[2022-12-27 21:20:08] <%+tronkles_> What I hate going on the most right now is the pushback against drag shows. Communities have been painting them as over-sexualized shows that have been affecting kids negatively.

[2022-12-27 21:21:57] <TheGreatZalgo> Something I have learned over the years talking with girls or playing games with them is that women can be just as or even more perverted than guys. Makes no sense that society tries to make it seem like the opposite.
[2022-12-27 21:22:03] <%+tronkles_> Oh certainly. I actually went to a drag show in the summer while I was in Vegas. It was super fun, but pretty sexual. Not always the case tho
[2022-12-27 21:22:03] <%dracohawkps4> Ppl thought she was oversexualized just because she had big booba while saying things like "Noone in Japan would have boobs that big!" When in reality Uzaki is based off of a friend of the author/artist of the original manga

[2022-12-27 22:34:47] <%+LederIappen> For example today for breakfast I had some Pancakes, very easy to make and if you’d calculate the price of everything in there it would propably be like 1.20€
[2022-12-27 22:34:52] <%huntsman_of_atlas> I realize how destructive that diet can be, but I’m still willing to do it
[2022-12-27 22:34:57] <%dracohawkps4> It's about quality of end of life!
[2022-12-27 22:35:06] <Tyrie2001> Also saw a vid comparing US grocery prices to UK ones. A lot of the fresh meat, fruit and veg was three to four times the cost in the US than they were in the UK

[2022-12-27 22:35:22] <wojna1> if food didn't had chemicals in it, it would be more expensive as it would go bad faster

[2022-12-27 22:54:10] <%+LederIappen> @huntsman_of_atlas That is way to low in Calories, especially if you then to any sport, in the end you will burn more calories doing sport than taking in and that will damage your body very much

[2022-12-27 22:56:09] <%+LederIappen> @huntsman_of_atlas Well but when you wanna up your health, a destructive path won’t be an option, because you will lower your health
[2022-12-27 22:56:19] <Tyrie2001> If I recall correctly, if you regularly consume less than 1200 calories a day, it'll put your body into starvation mode, where it starts burning muscle instead of fat to keep you alive. So, yeah, 500 calories is definitely not a healthy idea

[2022-12-27 23:00:38] <Tyrie2001> Also the more exercise you do, the more protein you need so your muscles can repair and grow stronger (and the more muscle mass you gain, the more calories your body will burn)
[2022-12-27 23:00:40] <weewee53r86> @ShayTheBean that usually means they're about to pupate!
