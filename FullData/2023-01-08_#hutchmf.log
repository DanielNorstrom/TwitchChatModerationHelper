[2023-01-08 00:59:49] <+F1toaster> the days where he'd play likew 30hrs, fall asleep halfway through a raid, wake up for like 5 seconds to kill a guy and be like wtf jsut happened haha @HutchMF

[2023-01-08 01:14:18] <+pineappled1ck> I get dat
[2023-01-08 01:14:22] <+F1toaster> this game just needs to be you, him and everyone else leave alone. Then occasionally you play with landmark, klean and willerz just like the first ever wipe. Thats the only time the game has been enjoyable for him. It was ruined as soon as everyone else came along. Just messy 3/4 mans with inexperienced players that get the group killed @HutchMF
[2023-01-08 01:14:34] <natur666> WTF

[2023-01-08 17:25:36] <+IUSECAPSL0CK> @HutchMF Curstis joined and started tk-ing
[2023-01-08 17:25:37] <%JTOctavius> cohhHmm I don't know had to get off early to fix a computer
[2023-01-08 17:25:40] <AkulCinabrv> they almost wiped 2 squads but he tk'd

[2023-01-08 17:26:05] <+killernugge> curtis killed josh then sum killed curtis
[2023-01-08 17:26:06] <%+TheChronic7> @HutchMF I think he hopped off and played some hunt showdown, then hopped back on eft with curtis and tked him
[2023-01-08 17:26:07] <+kodiakfly> curtis tked josh
[2023-01-08 17:26:08] <%+xZemy> heyo!

[2023-01-08 17:26:11] <%ChrisIsError_> come on hutch.  you know curtis didn't tk summit
[2023-01-08 17:26:13] <killxsilentxxx> Curtis tked josh
[2023-01-08 17:26:14] <ceburekk> summit is bot what u expect
[2023-01-08 17:26:17] <+CheezyStixx> Summit killed Curtis, Curtis killed josh
[2023-01-08 17:26:32] <AkulCinabrv> early in the day Curtis tk'd JoshOG(really fucking funny way btw) than alter iun the day summit tk'd Curtis @HutchMF
[2023-01-08 17:26:38] <tgwolf12> then got his buttons pushed inward
[2023-01-08 17:26:43] <Soaked_marvin> raiders in the bunker the same
[2023-01-08 17:26:43] <%victimcheech> @HutchMF Good Fucking Morning!!!!!!!
[2023-01-08 17:26:44] <%+NotWasabi> sometimes they spawn really late in the raid
[2023-01-08 17:26:50] <AkulCinabrv> after in the day*
[2023-01-08 17:26:52] <tgwolf12> so there is actually a trick to doing this quest
[2023-01-08 17:26:54] <%+kdubbz66> last wipe I always had scavs down there
[2023-01-08 17:26:55] <%1Dubnation1> is it the specific place ur at?
[2023-01-08 17:26:56] <%+Cluph> yeah, summit was complaining about that a couple days ago
[2023-01-08 17:27:02] <tgwolf12> may i share the trick?
[2023-01-08 17:27:11] <+crunkz69> @HutchMF I think they dont spawn if players are to close, as in you right now ratting in the garage, go away and come back and try again
[2023-01-08 17:27:15] <%1Dubnation1> cant wait to get that task
[2023-01-08 17:27:19] <%victimcheech> @1Dubnation1 what up royal!!!!

[2023-01-08 17:27:30] <+whoshards> Go in with all your stuff in backpack and be tagged and cursed
[2023-01-08 17:27:31] <SubTrainnn> can you play this on controller? just got my first pc and this mouse and key stuff is hard
[2023-01-08 17:27:33] <%1Dubnation1> @victimcheech whats good
[2023-01-08 17:27:40] <AkulCinabrv> @Cluph summit was still doing it yesterday.. LUL
[2023-01-08 17:27:43] <tgwolf12> okay so there will be a single scav that will walk in you chest him dont kill him

[2023-01-08 17:28:00] <tgwolf12> he will run away and bring friends the next time they come back
[2023-01-08 17:28:09] <%victimcheech> @1Dubnation1 about to get into a raid!!!

[2023-01-08 17:28:20] <kevinlovesya> yes
[2023-01-08 17:28:36] <%Azy666> @SubTrainnn I don't think it has actual controller support but if you use a program like xpadder you technically can. but it would be super hard to use.
[2023-01-08 17:28:39] <tgwolf12> but it will help to close the doors as well so you hear the door open
[2023-01-08 17:28:39] <zebruhfy> @SubTrainnn you could but it would be way harder on controller than learning on mouse and keyboard. its not a controller friendly game

[2023-01-08 20:15:57] <%+mikeymike3223_> or just wear a mask a face shield
[2023-01-08 20:15:59] <uhwhattimeisit> do you not think a fast pace to the game dont work or somethin
[2023-01-08 20:16:01] <+sully8680> they dont care about cheaters
[2023-01-08 20:16:09] <%+mikeymike3223_> you keep getting tap knife also wear face shield it might not be the best for stream quality but it'll protect you
[2023-01-08 20:16:10] <+MattDev> pushed out content? there has been no real content for 4 years though
[2023-01-08 20:16:12] <24ktpurp> And it gonna ruin the game in procosses

[2023-01-08 20:16:40] <SP4WN_4G4IN> yeah i always thought the audio was decent on this? hmm
[2023-01-08 20:16:51] <%Gavshowww> i found it weird how they released santa at the beginning of the wipe instead of before it wiped, they have scav karma but want to tank everyones karma
[2023-01-08 20:16:52] <videx240> @MattDev true lol a new gun here and there
[2023-01-08 20:16:57] <Mmmmm_Stuff> You only Hold Angles VS AI, you can't do it VS Pmc
[2023-01-08 20:16:57] <+MattDev> i think most people want them to fix their netcode and desync problems before they push out new content
[2023-01-08 20:16:58] <+Hard2FindGoodID> who are we watching
[2023-01-08 20:16:58] <%+vinboyy> sometimes it takes 20 min for scavs to spawn
[2023-01-08 20:17:04] <Joppet> @lil_izy69 I thought the game was about killing people and take their loot :D i guess i was wrong.

[2023-01-08 20:17:34] <+Zorrid> i was playing befor interchamge came out and the audio was better than this wipe, its bad dude
[2023-01-08 20:17:36] <kajoLIVE> The audio pre steam audio would be better than the audio right now.
[2023-01-08 20:17:36] <Bogbuck> before this wipe I didn't mind it too much
[2023-01-08 20:17:39] <+gagelprom> compared to COD the audio is phenomenal but that is a low fucking bar
[2023-01-08 20:17:40] <Dreamss> tarkov has never had good audio wym
[2023-01-08 20:17:42] <+MattDev> id rather have the old audio
[2023-01-08 20:17:42] <+tutsu0> Audio is REALLY bad, one of the worst Audio of any shooter
[2023-01-08 20:17:42] <$MrCM> at some point i will need a replay system, because im sick of all the bullshit. I dont care about their bullshit reasons for not adding it, eithers its because its an unoptimized mess, or its because they know how badly it will show the cheater problem
[2023-01-08 20:17:45] <+Simonizer7> @HutchMF i feel like audio in 0.11 was pretty good, then they tried to change it and its been a roller coaster since then
[2023-01-08 20:17:47] <%Bailz94> the sounds are good but the directional is what's hella bad LUL
[2023-01-08 20:17:48] <+B_Rock86> Audio is way worse now than it has been in the previous wipes. My only issue before was vertical audio, now its everything audio.
[2023-01-08 20:17:48] <%+jm0on> like we're in 2023 bro optimize ur game Sadge
[2023-01-08 20:17:50] <tim_flinn> @HutchMF play muted eyes only
[2023-01-08 20:17:52] <%+vinboyy> bra sounds like we are playing in the middle of a hurricane
[2023-01-08 20:17:54] <@%PaPaN0ffMF> i dont even play this game and the audio pisses me off lol
[2023-01-08 20:17:57] <%+shad3dspectr3> audio was never fixed once they changed the running sounds
[2023-01-08 20:17:59] <%+jonsliz> he probably means the SOUND EFFECTS are great, but the directional audio etc. is bad
[2023-01-08 20:18:02] <NOMODELZZ> That’s why it’s still in beta
[2023-01-08 20:18:06] <%TheSuperGoons> the audio wasnt as bad as it is now like 3 years ago
[2023-01-08 20:18:08] <+asteroidblues22> audio killed the game for me, less than 100 hours and i said fuck it.
[2023-01-08 20:18:13] <gitmaze> I dont mean any offence but isn't klean a bit Tarkov nerd

[2023-01-08 20:18:22] <%Bailz94> yh originally the audio was too OP
[2023-01-08 20:18:33] <+MattDev> it was good before they just needed it to be way quieter
[2023-01-08 20:18:37] <%+shad3dspectr3> horizontal is not that bad, but vertical is atrocious, and what you can hear in general is pretty bad also
[2023-01-08 20:18:44] <Zwungzy> Ego
[2023-01-08 20:18:44] <+YahwhaY> yeah they added exclusion zones all over for vertical audio and destroyed it
[2023-01-08 20:18:49] <%+unsoursop> Arrogance
[2023-01-08 20:18:49] <gitmaze> what is he carrying that is heavy
[2023-01-08 20:18:50] <+Braska7> I like inertia but with the desync as it is inertia just made the full commit aggressive right peak more prevalent. Once you commit that is it. If you try and reset you are on the other guys screen for 2 extra seconds.

[2023-01-08 20:19:14] <cr_z_> @HutchMF What's weird is the fact that VOIP directional sound is SO much better than the audio in general. What's that about?
[2023-01-08 20:19:14] <%+Dementedx1x> i mean they nerfed scavs after like 9-10 days this wipe

[2023-01-08 20:19:27] <+Braska7> The early weight system was the last time they toned it back a lot. But they went back on that.
[2023-01-08 20:19:31] <HowellLikeAWolf> I don't know how Arena will survive if the audio is going to be as bad as this

[2023-01-08 20:20:32] <+MattDev> lets hope they listen to the community
[2023-01-08 20:20:35] <Shoulder_Deep> you can still see people wearing sunglasses through any and all fog at all distances. thats been in the game since it came out
[2023-01-08 20:20:37] <%+shad3dspectr3> I've been playing since 2018 consistently, and the peaker's advantage has always been a thing, audio has been a challenge, and does anyone remember the stutters, my god
[2023-01-08 20:20:37] <+Scrazeloppe> I just bought this game today. About to go play for the first time. Any advice?

[2023-01-08 20:20:50] <+Braska7> I find the big new content wipe is not great. It the mid year wipe that cleans up the Christmas one that gets better.
[2023-01-08 20:20:50] <+MattDev> thats a BS answer @ShadowwMoses  they have tens of millions of dollars to hire people to figure it tf out
[2023-01-08 20:20:52] <Zwungzy> s their job
[2023-01-08 20:20:52] <poopoots> its easy to rollback a patch, then push it out again when its working properly LOL
[2023-01-08 20:20:56] <BallenTime> @Acey_19 has Klean's cam behind hiim

[2023-01-08 20:21:02] <Dreamss> this game could be the best game on the planet with fixes theres no other game like it
[2023-01-08 20:21:04] <%+itsbuffinmuffin> glasses still glowing lol
[2023-01-08 20:21:09] <+tutsu0> No its not harder than you think.... They literally have EVERY build of the game, they just revert it by pushing the previous build
[2023-01-08 20:21:11] <+Jacksmackz> good analogy
[2023-01-08 20:21:16] <+MattDev> they legit made tens of millions of dollars to hire people to fix these problems lol
[2023-01-08 20:21:21] <+Kingblockrunner> revert THIS
[2023-01-08 20:21:25] <tim_flinn> you have to recompile the entire build it is way harder than that.

[2023-01-08 20:21:54] <+Braska7> They are committing to a game concept they are not even sure they can pull off.

[2023-01-08 20:25:34] <KingBootsma> Hey Hutch, what was your favorite baseball organization you played for?
[2023-01-08 20:25:38] <+BigBoolin510> i had the same thing happen to me yesterday i was done for by mid day called it quits
[2023-01-08 20:25:43] <+YahwhaY> @noboeef Find people to play with, Play alot of solos. But it feels like getting kicked in the balls
[2023-01-08 20:25:49] <Farkoh> just get one guy to bring nothing and run there and they'll aggro timmy
[2023-01-08 20:25:50] <%+shad3dspectr3> @noboeef that's exactly what i did
[2023-01-08 20:25:51] <TTV_Lt_MikeMurphy> is that klean?
