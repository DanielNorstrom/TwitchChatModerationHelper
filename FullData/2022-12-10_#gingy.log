[2022-12-10 14:25:29] <@%IGotBurgerz> ginger4Hii @dhaemian
[2022-12-10 14:25:33] <mcge> sorry for the suggestion I didn't know if you played it or not.  awesome that you used to play it.  the new one is so flipping great I can't get off it
[2022-12-10 14:25:36] <%+NitrateHz> best way to grow your channel is to play dead games like Tarkov Kappa LUL
[2022-12-10 14:25:44] <@%Dhaemian> Hey @IGotBurgerz ginger4Hii ginger4Heart
[2022-12-10 14:25:54] <aWildPootis> there should be arena besides tarkov soon enough PepeLaugh
[2022-12-10 14:26:00] <mcge> Tarkov is better than CoD imo, but I just keep getting creamed in c
[2022-12-10 14:26:02] <+RING3RR> tarkov is really the only FPS i really enjoy. battlefield (not 2042) and cod for when i play with my friends who dont really play tarkov but thats the only time id play any other FPS
[2022-12-10 14:26:02] <mcge> in tarkov
[2022-12-10 14:26:03] <Pittfall12> hiw many wipes have you been playing, gingy?
[2022-12-10 14:26:03] <thunderbot111> I,m good at COD, but i suck at Tarkov :)
[2022-12-10 14:26:04] <+Fozzytime> how is Tarkov dead?
[2022-12-10 14:26:15] <%+NitrateHz> thats why i said Kappa LUL
[2022-12-10 14:26:19] <Volcomstone161> the worst thing is not be yourself
[2022-12-10 14:26:23] <MagicMeech> marauders is somewhat ded rn though
[2022-12-10 14:26:29] <MagicMeech> poor mawaders
[2022-12-10 14:26:33] <Smushy> best way to grow is just realising it s hard and just not get demotiovated
[2022-12-10 14:26:35] <@%IGotBurgerz> lol best way to grow your channel is YT/TikTok and other ppl platforms
[2022-12-10 14:26:46] <MagicMeech> i love marauders
[2022-12-10 14:27:02] <+RING3RR> "im personally bored of a game that other people still play, must be dead game" Kappa
[2022-12-10 14:27:03] <wooish> how we livin', how's endwipe comin
[2022-12-10 14:27:03] <ImNotMalicious> Marauders is a cool concept just don‚Äôt like the guns
[2022-12-10 14:27:06] VIEWERS: 414
[2022-12-10 14:27:10] <mcge> the best way to grow is to expand your horizons and try new things
[2022-12-10 14:27:15] <MagicMeech> i hope it get to the level of complexity that lightly touches tarkov
[2022-12-10 14:27:18] <+asapbilly1000> marauders is very dead
[2022-12-10 14:27:20] <thunderbot111> I'm playing for months to get to lvl 18 and now they are doing the wipe :(
[2022-12-10 14:27:25] <MagicMeech> thats kinda what i want out of the space combat
[2022-12-10 14:27:31] <@%+jimmiedrum> @imnotmalicious right, we have space ships, but use guns from ww2
[2022-12-10 14:27:32] <MagicMeech> it to be challenging and fun
[2022-12-10 14:27:42] <wooish> what tarky goals do we have here endwipe?

[2022-12-10 14:28:06] <+RING3RR> marauders is fun, just little content so it gets boring fast but its fun with friends and i cant wait to see what they do with it.
[2022-12-10 14:28:06] <+Topic_TW> I always lose motivation for tasks around level 35-40. Next wipe I‚Äôm gonna push for kappa tho!
[2022-12-10 14:28:07] <Volcomstone161> i dont play tarkov but the games i do play are tf2 and cs source cause thats what i grew up on

[2022-12-10 16:25:45] <czebrych> wonder when somebody is going to make an app that you can bet your Irl money on the date of the wipe
[2022-12-10 16:25:49] <auraxarr> what does "Norka" balsam do? I see famous movie actor uses it regularly too :)
[2022-12-10 16:25:49] <+meowkittykat01> wipe is usually after i poop
[2022-12-10 16:25:54] <%Branch3r> "funny"
[2022-12-10 16:25:57] <chrischeese6969> streamer have been saying for years that no one knows when wipe is KEKW
[2022-12-10 16:26:08] <Voicebox> its between now and the end of the year, thats all anyone knows
[2022-12-10 16:26:15] <@%+jimmiedrum> exactly
[2022-12-10 16:26:29] <ReinhardtVonLohengramm> same as that one's following that knew when jebus was returning

[2022-12-10 16:26:43] <recon_xe> you were moving when he came in
[2022-12-10 16:26:44] <+SnuffedCO> I'd be the guy that would say something completely off, like "Yeah wipe is in 2025."

[2022-12-10 16:26:51] <%Crawlern> lvl 19 btw
[2022-12-10 16:26:58] <snazzybeast_69> he knew for sure
[2022-12-10 16:27:00] <ReinhardtVonLohengramm> he was running
[2022-12-10 16:27:02] <+BongoBongolo> the spinners are out
[2022-12-10 16:27:03] <%+John2442> streamers say they don't know all the time and still have ppl ask them all stream when wipe is so annoying
[2022-12-10 16:27:05] <auraxarr> its hard arguing with a pistol against an AR...
[2022-12-10 16:27:05] <ReinhardtVonLohengramm> then he just stopped
[2022-12-10 16:27:08] <harry144444> I thought he just entered and was either regaining stamina or waiting to listen around inside
[2022-12-10 16:27:13] <%+lukewarmish8> Any new event
[2022-12-10 16:27:14] <chrischeese6969> but when i go on dorm i dont even hear ppl running KEKW

[2022-12-10 19:15:24] <+ReK_42> You only have two ears. You don't need more than two speakers for full directional sound if they're right in your ears

[2022-12-10 19:16:05] <+Doubleplusepic> @Echolucent Audio tech here, it's the same way regular headphones do, by panning stereo audio in different ratios left to right, and the sounds themselves are tailored differently frequencywise. to tell you whether theyre in front/behind/up/down

[2022-12-10 19:18:59] <+Echolucent> @Echolucent Appreciate the non passive-aggressive response. I was just curious because of the size of the ear buds vs headphones. Because obviously the over the head headsets has more space i have different directions for sound (front and behind)

[2022-12-10 19:20:40] <+Doubleplusepic> It's all filters to frequencies in the signal that differentiate between front/backup/down. The headphones have two big drivers left and right, so the space itself doesn't matter. What does is isolating room noise from your hearing, which is why I'll always pick over-ear.
[2022-12-10 19:20:44] <%tmacinc> Are there any events currently?

[2022-12-10 19:21:28] <+ReK_42> Not arguing about buds vs headphones, but directional sound doesn't work that way. Front/back matters irl based on the shape of the ear but if you have a speaker at each ear you can emulate the difference in software. Not cupping around the east doesn't lose anything

[2022-12-10 19:22:25] <+Doubleplusepic> @ReK_42 Exactly, so in theory ear buds won't cost you much in terms of actually audio quality, but in terms of comfort/isolation, you cant beat cans

[2022-12-10 19:23:13] <+ReK_42> doubleplusepic that's personal preference though. I agree and use over ears but since people find iems much more comfortable and well made ones are just fine for isolation

Even if its gingy. Worth it. My brother told me a good saying to live by. "Ending your own life, solves all yoru problems, but it causes so many problems for others." Don't ever let depression win. Rise above it and you'll do great things

[2022-12-10 20:25:35] <DarkKraken69> @thatclassifieddracula I go through suicidality at least 3 times a week. When I feel on top of the world, I fell invincible. Sometimes I need a lil pick me up too. That's life. Remember this if nothing else: "People are stupid. I don't leave myself out of that category. I've done some stupid stuff, and when you've been stupid, you notice it in others"

[2022-12-10 22:05:48] <TomahawkChuck> i want even playing field
[2022-12-10 22:06:02] <+StarzxIzi> Yes it should be, but tarkov has a lock system that makes me basicly play with gear locked against lvl 60+ stuffed ppl
[2022-12-10 22:06:04] <%Crawlern> I finished my weekly. so no clue what to do now
[2022-12-10 22:06:24] <CooolCat> cool, thanks
[2022-12-10 22:06:30] <%+Mal_akh_> OBS can natively prevent audio tracks to be saved in the VODs, just FYI
[2022-12-10 22:06:32] <@%+jimmiedrum> if you don't say earl Grey, hot, are you really drinking tea?
[2022-12-10 22:06:38] <samuelb00> is that still the viewer kit?

[2022-12-10 22:07:43] <+crow_x99x> I need to get my audio and visuals set up for tarkov again, been awhile since I played... anyone got any videos I can watch for settings?
[2022-12-10 22:07:50] <dewberto69> Because no sbmm
[2022-12-10 22:07:58] <$HackDotSlash> Afternoon!
[2022-12-10 22:08:00] <@%+jimmiedrum> cause there is no level consideration in raid selection
[2022-12-10 22:08:04] <chimmychongaz101> I‚Äôm still learning the game but I thought it put you with people your lvl or near it
[2022-12-10 22:08:05] <ImNotMalicious> @chimmychongaz101 there is no sbmm in this game
[2022-12-10 22:08:07] <+cottontailsmizz> @chimmychongaz101 there isnt skill based match making in tarkov
[2022-12-10 22:08:11] <Dr_Rhone> IMO late wipe is best for people who dont play much, cheap hideout items, less traffic in quest areas plus you can scav and find dead juicy bois PogChamp just my opinion
[2022-12-10 22:08:16] <chimmychongaz101> Oh I thought there was
[2022-12-10 22:08:22] <%bobl65> @chimmychongaz101 because it give you best ping on aserver..not by level on players
[2022-12-10 22:08:22] <+cottontailsmizz> @chimmychongaz101 lul welcome to tarkov
[2022-12-10 22:08:27] <chimmychongaz101> Thanks man
