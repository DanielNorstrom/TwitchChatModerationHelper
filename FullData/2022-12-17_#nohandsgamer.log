[2022-12-17 00:00:24] <paradoxymorphone> The condition NHG has is called "Gigantus Phallus"
[2022-12-17 00:00:36] <%culleexus> jeah its all blueish and theres ice on the chest after login Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:00:36] <CheckersCat> oh you want to know his rank, might as well as his social security number too

[2022-12-17 00:01:19] <%vayazu2> did you watch worlds earlier?
[2022-12-17 00:02:04] <+helix_sky> ppl on world roping is a little annoying
[2022-12-17 00:02:24] <+Docnoq> if you thought ropers were annoying today just wait until pascoa plays
[2022-12-17 00:02:28] <dalitzking> I'd rope every turn for 100k LUL
[2022-12-17 00:02:32] <MrHandsomeNoodle> firebat won worlds and never roped once Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:02:33] <%loganhound> Lots of Covid
[2022-12-17 00:02:36] <%culleexus> you either rope or you are xblyze thats how it is

[2022-12-17 00:02:44] <timocrx> The >1 hour priest mirror was my favorite game KEKW
[2022-12-17 00:02:48] <wildwulf> isn't it completely fucked that some players have to play at absurd hours of the day since the event is online
[2022-12-17 00:02:59] <!%goatslayerhs> he also had t9 choose between spider tank and spider tank Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:03:07] <dalitzking> LUL
[2022-12-17 00:03:07] <+CS_Apples> If you rope every turn they might get annoyed and just concede, always worth the shot Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:03:10] <Atpeta> I suffered Jarla on a qualifier, 15min for 5min games xD
[2022-12-17 00:03:13] <dalitzking> 5head

[2022-12-17 00:03:58] <%JonsyBones> DH is the devil's butthole. Thoughts?
[2022-12-17 00:03:59] <IcyMcSp1cy> plaguespreader should be a battlecry

[2022-12-17 00:04:24] <!%goatslayerhs> plague spreader shouldn't be allowed to hit another plague spreader
[2022-12-17 00:04:24] <+RKD14> nerf priest, didn't die fast enough
[2022-12-17 00:04:34] <%culleexus> should transform minions in deck also, thoughts?
[2022-12-17 00:04:36] <helmetwearer> Playing your minions? NOOO MY ONLY WEAKNESS
[2022-12-17 00:04:37] <%+shanevapid> It should be a start of game effect

[2022-12-17 00:05:43] <RiseWasHereHS> let's hope he doesn't rope us!
[2022-12-17 00:05:49] <%culleexus> but we could rope him? thoughts?
[2022-12-17 00:06:09] <CheckersCat> make it a 1/1 but also it gets the the boar deathrattle so first to have 6 die gets the weapon

[2022-12-17 00:11:59] <+lawrencelord> Yeah. Making it a 3/3 would really smite its power level
[2022-12-17 00:12:08] <z_whitte> shouldnt he concede as soon as pelican hits the board
[2022-12-17 00:12:12] <+MantoWhee> o hay it's eswaff again

[2022-12-17 00:12:49] <%FatalVindicator> ok, so are you swapping a card slot out and naming this deck after this most marginal card slot? maximum bait LUL
[2022-12-17 00:12:54] <%+Razorbam> Why not =P

[2022-12-17 00:13:21] <%nonameswtf> how does this fare against evolve shaman?
[2022-12-17 00:13:44] <+MantoWhee> and this is exactly why we have pelicans!
[2022-12-17 00:13:47] <+MantoWhee> die 2/3s

[2022-12-17 00:14:25] <%FatalVindicator> caw caw priest is the best deck ;)
[2022-12-17 00:14:27] <giovannigiorgioo> Greetings from Sweden! Love the content. Will you play some Boon Pirest soon?

[2022-12-17 00:15:26] <+Onyrius> Thought: your hand it blows
[2022-12-17 00:15:28] <TheMrDudeManSir> Does this hand consistently blow?
[2022-12-17 00:15:42] <%vayazu2> does boon run new cards
[2022-12-17 00:15:45] <LaHistorica93> !quest
[2022-12-17 00:15:45] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.
[2022-12-17 00:15:56] <wildwulf> for your hand to not blow, you have to put in good cards in the first place Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:15:59] <%culleexus> @vayazu2 the 1 mana revive

[2022-12-17 00:20:49] <%falafeller_> @kalihoratv no wild would have vines around the legend symbol fastest way to tell wild apart

[2022-12-17 00:24:19] <KalihoraTv> i'm back to hs after 3 years, is it a good time to create a new deck or is the meta gonna change soon?
[2022-12-17 00:24:24] <%+Darkthunder119> whirlpool should remove the Mida from their collection TBH thats only fair.
[2022-12-17 00:24:25] <%TentoMan> just silence whril, no other choice rly

[2022-12-17 00:52:25] <+Onyrius> I found the best way to deal@with ropers is to play fast, eventually they feel silly and start playing normally

[2022-12-17 01:14:07] <CheckersCat> dude will accept friend invite now probably

[2022-12-17 01:14:14] <%JonsyBones> "I got him! I pwned that streamer! My life isn't a waste" he said, sobbing
[2022-12-17 01:14:20] <NovaBSL> I've seen streamers getting these type of a-holes banned just by sending word to a HS community manager PauseChamp
[2022-12-17 01:14:23] <%Penguin_Edd> @Zaxlor yea it does suck
[2022-12-17 01:14:40] <+O_T_K> @zaxlor If they had “bad game experience” as an option they would get 11 million reports a day
[2022-12-17 01:14:47] <%Arkarku> being a fuck isn't against the rules LUL
[2022-12-17 01:14:50] <+testa_87> There's no way for a control deck to win against a combo like that, that should be fixed somehow....
[2022-12-17 01:14:55] <%kaiserwroth> Chat typing all these while he’s rank 34 playing against streamers monkaHmm
[2022-12-17 01:14:55] <NovaBSL> It's bad sportmanship and that's against the game's TOS
[2022-12-17 01:14:57] <CheckersCat> "i beat that streamer" he tells his wifes boyfriend
[2022-12-17 01:15:04] <afroAlCo> annoying = perma banned from hs
[2022-12-17 01:15:10] <NovaBSL> @Arkarku It is tho
[2022-12-17 01:15:13] <alwaysjagged> blame the card designers for enabling people like that
[2022-12-17 01:15:19] <LonebrowXd> pascoa strat worked
[2022-12-17 01:15:25] <LonebrowXd> PepegaPls
[2022-12-17 01:15:27] <%JonsyBones> @kaiserwroth You're right. Streaming sniping is very impressive
[2022-12-17 01:15:35] <%Penguin_Edd> we move
[2022-12-17 01:15:40] <+phrasinghs> Didn’t feno get duriwinner banned for stuff like that?
[2022-12-17 01:15:42] <ColonelBlabby> i wonder if we needed to clear our own board cause we plagued 2 minions so there was no pyro
[2022-12-17 01:15:44] <khuchten> theothar is designed to beat decks like that but too bad he is gonna cost 10 mana soon at this rate
[2022-12-17 01:15:48] <Zaxlor> @O_T_K The way it works in other Blizzard games is that if a person gets x amount of reports, then it'll automatically temp ban that person. It's MEANT to escalate that to a real person too, but that doesn't always happen LUL I mean, if one dude is getting like 10+ reports a day, there's probably something wrong with that person
[2022-12-17 01:15:53] <hskookdoug> the pascoa strat might be legit, you just lose all your allies/friends along the way LUL
[2022-12-17 01:16:19] <%Arkarku> @Arkarku just because things are -reportable- doesnt mean blizz takes action on them. I.e. the "unskilled opponent in league" literally just existed to make you feel better about reporting someone LUL
[2022-12-17 01:16:30] <+O_T_K> @zaxlor True but im saying they would have kids reporting for simply losing games all the time
[2022-12-17 01:16:33] <+the_high_groundd> sometimes the difference between a good play and a bad play is no play at all
[2022-12-17 01:16:41] <zippywow> @Arkarku what does reporting unskilled player do? does it drop their mmr?
[2022-12-17 01:16:56] <baldguyfromcrank> Nohands best hearthstone streamer ❤️
[2022-12-17 01:16:58] <%Arkarku> @zippywow no, unskilled report in league does/did literally nothing
[2022-12-17 01:17:04] <+FreefallSirius> @the_high_groundd The ole neutral jump
[2022-12-17 01:17:06] <zippywow> ok
[2022-12-17 01:17:10] <NylonIntruder> The unskilled opponent in league thing is cause of people buying ranked accounts LUL
[2022-12-17 01:17:12] <Zaxlor> @O_T_K  If one person reported EVERY player the faced, it wouldn't make much difference. But if that one dick kept getting reported by all his oppeonent, it'd shut them down
[2022-12-17 01:17:25] <yhcho927000> it will be more problem when ranked would make them qualify for competition other than self-satisfaction
[2022-12-17 01:17:30] <zippywow> what game is harder to reach the top HS or league?
[2022-12-17 01:17:40] <NovaBSL> @Arkarku but bad sportsmanship is against the rules still, and I've seen people getting banned a handful of times for exactly what that guy did
[2022-12-17 01:17:44] <baldguyfromcrank> You got it bro
[2022-12-17 01:17:47] <baldguyfromcrank> 😂

[2022-12-17 01:18:43] <KING_TDoT42> had caps on by accident
[2022-12-17 01:18:44] <%Arkarku> @NovaBSL that's full COPIUM . roping on its own isnt against tos, and you can't prove that that guy was roping -just- to be a cuck
[2022-12-17 01:18:45] <CheckersCat> if you put in a report feature you also put in a feature to match the people getting reported with eachother.
[2022-12-17 01:18:58] <!%goatslayerhs> I typed that before you cleared his minions LUL

[2022-12-17 06:48:53] <+BoltharHS> The play before, what about trading the amulet to get an extra Deathrattle since you had 2 Thrives in hand? Lightshower and Scorpid were up. Tempo 4/4 more important?
[2022-12-17 06:49:04] <%+ucdchris1> yeah ive heard that they start knocking out of the lower amount of minutes the further along u go

[2022-12-17 07:29:58] <%+slighthaze> they should have little 1 mana mask cards that you can use to protect your minions from plague spreader Kappa thoughts?
[2022-12-17 07:29:58] <Freeedomvg> there are midas some probably not but maybe SoBayed
[2022-12-17 07:30:00] <berkiee> the real question is what happens if worlds comes before the game is over
[2022-12-17 07:30:07] <Jerry_licious> theoretically yes but someone is going to end up with more Midas sticking with an amulet play or something

[2022-12-17 08:04:49] <%+kevinblaze> It is weird that I started here partly bc I mostly support underrated smol streamers with cool vibes, but sometimes they get bigger :P <3
[2022-12-17 08:04:54] <cabstero> love me some feno

[2022-12-17 08:05:46] <Jerry_licious> The fact that the biggest HS stream right now was playing priest mirrors shows that we should nerf all other decks to create more priest mirrors
[2022-12-17 08:05:46] <+fisporr> I'm here cuz my daughter woke me. i will have gone back to sleep if you weren't live

[2022-12-17 08:06:19] <biitzl> their algo is not working
[2022-12-17 08:06:25] <Bilwitz> most people who want to stream can't sustain themselves for the time required to become self sustaining through twitch
[2022-12-17 08:06:26] <%vayazu2> KEKW
[2022-12-17 08:07:16] <TheAtheistGod> being consistent you get people knowing that you are on without having to check, so they can decide to go watch you directly
[2022-12-17 08:07:51] <TheAtheistGod> so you get viewers who might be doing something other than watch twitch at that time or get viewers who might have decided to browse randomly otherwise
[2022-12-17 08:08:01] <Apoplectical> @nohandsgamer I remember there was a bed behind you while you were streaming in early times :D

[2022-12-17 08:25:38] <biitzl> i asked boar and he said its working fine
[2022-12-17 08:25:40] <@%+InsomAtLaw> hello chat i have arrived
[2022-12-17 08:25:41] <+paddycakes> Druid seems fair
[2022-12-17 08:25:53] <ndv9290> play around it 4Head
[2022-12-17 08:25:53] <@%lass_leah> this is somehow denathrius' fault
[2022-12-17 08:25:55] <unknlai> they nerf sire, then print new sire
[2022-12-17 08:25:57] <jungl4thx3> he's bug abuser (anub rekhan)
[2022-12-17 08:26:00] <biitzl> no the manathirst is supposed to double
[2022-12-17 08:26:02] <sandwraith03> your plaugue spreader is busted
[2022-12-17 08:26:05] <@%lass_leah> Insom nohandsHey
[2022-12-17 08:26:06] <%berkiee> i didnt know that, have they said they will fix it?
[2022-12-17 08:26:12] <%+synnebane> I thought the reason was that mana thirs boosted the battle cry?
[2022-12-17 08:26:21] <biitzl> its not a bug
[2022-12-17 08:26:24] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> @je_suis_dfg the last astalor guy is the only manathirst that triggers 2x with brann
[2022-12-17 08:26:29] <%+synnebane> as opposed to being it's own thing
[2022-12-17 08:26:36] <unknlai> that change the battle cry, not additional effect
[2022-12-17 08:26:47] <bizjeet5> I thought the brann replay didn't get the manathirst boost
[2022-12-17 08:26:47] <biitzl> anub is a bug but for a different reason
[2022-12-17 08:27:29] <@%lass_leah> another 40 minute game widepeepoHappy
[2022-12-17 08:27:30] <marcospcs1> 5/5 dont give double armor
[2022-12-17 08:27:32] <roboticowl> I think it's that the damage is the battlecry and the manathirst just increases that damage
[2022-12-17 08:27:33] <Freeedomvg> @synnebane dont get 5 armor twice but get 8 damage twice so its inconsistent LUL
[2022-12-17 08:27:44] <bnwatson94> peepoPee
[2022-12-17 08:27:44] <%+synnebane> but the last part is worded different
[2022-12-17 08:27:46] <jungl4thx3> 2 drop and 5 drop arent battlecry, 8 drop is
[2022-12-17 08:27:50] <%+xcesme> Worlds was supposed to be only 4 hours but there was a priest mirror so it was 11 hours instead
[2022-12-17 08:27:56] <unknlai> well, dev has their own interpretation to the card text LUL
[2022-12-17 08:28:12] <Freeedomvg> @xcesme 12hr+ stream OMEGALUL
[2022-12-17 08:28:13] <%+synnebane> the others say do it but the last one say deal 8 mor
[2022-12-17 08:28:22] <unknlai> actually that priest mirror only last 1 hour
[2022-12-17 08:28:24] <@%+InsomAtLaw> i like rogue now because of COCs
[2022-12-17 08:28:33] <Freeedomvg> @synnebane u should be lawyer
[2022-12-17 08:28:39] <@%lass_leah> wait wait quest priest sometimes plays that, maybe they mulligan quest monkaHmm
[2022-12-17 08:28:53] <Freeedomvg> synnebane read the fine print its 32 SeriousSloth
[2022-12-17 08:29:42] <Freeedomvg> why did blizzard release Plaguespreader after covid a little insensitive HotPokket @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-17 08:29:54] <unknlai> I think they need to change the card text to fit the actual effect.   not "additional 8 dmg", but "deal 16 dmg instead"

[2022-12-17 08:31:21] <%berkiee> i think its: thoughts?
[2022-12-17 08:31:31] <%+xcesme> Thoughts ?
[2022-12-17 08:31:45] <Freeedomvg> i think its: Can i have mod? SoBayed
[2022-12-17 08:32:12] <@%+InsomAtLaw> i'm a "mod"
[2022-12-17 08:32:12] <quaq13> it's impressive how precise mouse movements are
[2022-12-17 08:32:13] <Freeedomvg> Modge
[2022-12-17 08:32:16] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> did you just say: "how do you move without your hands?" 1)we can see your hands 2) why would that stop you from moving?
[2022-12-17 08:32:17] <@%lass_leah> same

[2022-12-17 08:32:49] <Freeedomvg> this deck would be good with more legendaries
[2022-12-17 08:32:57] <ShaTheOne> atleast not in most streams
[2022-12-17 08:33:14] <markelause> pelicans have a really short generation time in this game

[2022-12-17 08:36:58] <rhadnard> Its not expensive if lamb is a common meat where you live
[2022-12-17 08:37:40] <%vayazu2> i do love lamb. back home people have it for easter
[2022-12-17 08:37:41] <Reverend1974> Lamb is a common meat here in the UK. And expensive.
[2022-12-17 08:37:44] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> ya, isn't lamb cheaper than beef in UK? beef was way way cheaper in US
[2022-12-17 08:38:22] <Reverend1974> No. Beef is cheaper than lamb in the UK. Except cuts like sirloin and fillet
[2022-12-17 08:38:47] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> in US lamb chops are more expensive than ribeye steak

[2022-12-17 08:48:21] <johnnygmtg1987> Ya we seem to reactive for this matchup
[2022-12-17 08:49:25] <bizjeet5> just a horrible matchup you can't put enough pressure and plaguespreaders aren't fast enough disruption vs the 4 spell damage minion version
[2022-12-17 08:49:47] <@%+InsomAtLaw> just win 4Head

[2022-12-17 08:54:17] <Bilwitz> odds quest DH isn't nerfed next week?
[2022-12-17 08:55:30] <bizjeet5> @bilwitz low
[2022-12-17 08:56:00] <Bilwitz> I think there is a chance that there is no nerfs cause holidays
[2022-12-17 08:56:13] <Bilwitz> will be a long hearthstone winter if so
[2022-12-17 08:56:23] <%culleexus> they will cater to reddit and nerf druid in some way. 100%
[2022-12-17 08:56:27] <IronfistHS> theotar to 7 mana 5/5
[2022-12-17 08:56:31] <+wownickwow> they should buff dk

[2022-12-17 08:56:37] <rhadnard> I dont think they will nerf the DH quest directly, it may be a indirect nerf

[2022-12-17 08:57:31] <Bilwitz> what if they change the triple unholy rune 1mana card for DK into summon a 2/2 plague spreader

[2022-12-17 22:57:58] <rodrik_harlaw> both UF used and both aldrachi blades out - why not blizz ping and face?
[2022-12-17 22:58:20] <rodrik_harlaw> both used
[2022-12-17 22:58:25] <%Penguin_Edd> seemed like a good line

[2022-12-17 23:00:56] <SadLH> I hope blizzard does something about a-noob-rekan along with rogue and DH..
[2022-12-17 23:01:29] <Magnarn1> anubrekan might be ok next patch if scales rotates along with bran

[2022-12-17 23:08:29] <%WezaRipoto> @NoHandsGamer how does this deck differ from big spell mage and, and how come neither run iceblood tower by default, it seems pretty strong when I get it randomly

[2022-12-17 23:11:37] <%Penguin_Edd> your opponent ran out of skill
[2022-12-17 23:11:41] <@%lass_leah> well ... we're technically fine but
[2022-12-17 23:11:43] <P00nutButter> Out armors warriors so sad
[2022-12-17 23:11:46] <SadLH> how can you play this????

[2022-12-17 23:12:20] <SadLH> @P00nutButter wait.. you want to tell me this isn't a warrior? Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:12:22] <LeonGaltran> has*
[2022-12-17 23:12:27] <SpykoNukov> wouldn't 10 dmg all be enough ?
[2022-12-17 23:12:32] <SpykoNukov> or does he have another brann ?
[2022-12-17 23:12:36] <+iTerko> he has another brann
[2022-12-17 23:12:39] <SpykoNukov> shit
[2022-12-17 23:13:24] <%+xcesme> NHG what would your solid alibi be? Sex cult?
[2022-12-17 23:13:26] <%+xcesme> thoughts
[2022-12-17 23:13:41] <SpykoNukov> should've played solid alibi Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:13:53] <%Penguin_Edd> for a losing matchup, did well
[2022-12-17 23:13:55] <%+xcesme> no LUL
[2022-12-17 23:13:56] <@%lass_leah> surely not
[2022-12-17 23:14:00] <%+xcesme> its like cariel
[2022-12-17 23:14:03] <%snoop_frfr> correct, it does nothing because it's 1 damage multiple times
[2022-12-17 23:14:04] <rodrik_harlaw> it's diff than denathrius
[2022-12-17 23:14:04] <SpykoNukov> yeah no it's like for cariel, doesn't do jack shit
[2022-12-17 23:14:06] <tomahawkyoself> we were telling you the whole game lol
[2022-12-17 23:14:07] <c0liseum> same result
[2022-12-17 23:14:08] <+SnowMyzer> it doesn't
[2022-12-17 23:14:16] <Legendary_Anna> solid does not block
[2022-12-17 23:14:20] <@%lass_leah> we need to maindeck Jailor nohandsKappa
[2022-12-17 23:14:20] <SpykoNukov> nah astalor is fine, brann and guff are issues tho
[2022-12-17 23:14:22] <%+xcesme> Which astalor needs a nerf there are 3 casThink
[2022-12-17 23:14:23] <grimBleeper> YEP we needed to nerf denathrius for sure
[2022-12-17 23:14:26] <BAJSNIGHTOUT> cut solid alibi from deck FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-17 23:14:31] <%Penguin_Edd> astalor shoudl get the denathruis treatment just for alibi Kappa Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:14:48] <SpykoNukov> @Penguin_Edd hey would also be a buff to cariel
[2022-12-17 23:14:50] <rodrik_harlaw> denathrius is the unique one - they didn't want the lifesteal animation to take time on each individual ping
[2022-12-17 23:14:58] <Yristul> i think the funniest part of the sire nerf is that the only class really hurt by it was the shiny new dk
[2022-12-17 23:15:07] <%Penguin_Edd> @SpykoNukov damn, its gotta change for the matchup then
[2022-12-17 23:15:55] <%Penguin_Edd> woah, nice invisibility potion
[2022-12-17 23:16:08] <Yristul> blizzard has gotta feel really dumb with their no dk ban rule at worlds and there bign no dks partially because of the nerf they did right beforehand
[2022-12-17 23:16:34] <%+xcesme> The fact that there is no DK at worlds is a good thing
[2022-12-17 23:16:35] <%snoop_frfr> even with sire dk was still bad so it probably didnt matter
[2022-12-17 23:16:35] <@%lass_leah> the Denathrius nerf didn't have any real bearing on no DKs at worlds
[2022-12-17 23:16:44] <%+xcesme> If it was good it would have broken the balance of the game
[2022-12-17 23:16:50] <@%lass_leah> that class was bad ope-nerf
[2022-12-17 23:16:51] <%+xcesme> people who dont understand this are not smart
[2022-12-17 23:17:34] <@%lass_leah> they could have just as easily mandated 1 DK deck in every list but they thankfully didn't
[2022-12-17 23:17:40] <SpykoNukov> I think they were afraid of a redo of the DH release
[2022-12-17 23:17:41] <grimBleeper> YEP no one will remember the dk release positively
[2022-12-17 23:18:01] <%snoop_frfr> still better than demon hunter release imo
[2022-12-17 23:18:34] <Justicebeaver89> Any eggpriest at worlds?
[2022-12-17 23:18:37] <+SnowMyzer> i think DK just needs time to develop as a class with more cards
[2022-12-17 23:18:39] <@%lass_leah> I liked DH release. new classes should warp the meta imo
[2022-12-17 23:18:42] <%snoop_frfr> cool drink, messes with the green screen
[2022-12-17 23:18:56] <rodrik_harlaw> @snoop_frfr dh being op is better outcome than dk being shit imo
[2022-12-17 23:19:16] <SpykoNukov> I mean yeah, the community want balance, seems fair to me
[2022-12-17 23:19:36] <Yristul> i like op shit when its board based stuff
[2022-12-17 23:19:38] <SadLH> we are doomed.. NotLikeThis
[2022-12-17 23:19:39] <%snoop_frfr> @rodrik_harlaw is it really though? would have gotten old real quick
[2022-12-17 23:20:02] <SadLH> @Yristul you do not love random powerful stuff?? Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:20:22] <grimBleeper> well it was cheap, that's why it wasn't interesting
[2022-12-17 23:20:28] <Justicebeaver89> too late to craft eggpriest or do you think it will be viable for awhile?
[2022-12-17 23:20:37] <grimBleeper> the solution was to give hunter a windfury weapon along with it Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:20:43] <Yristul> i love random powerful stuff when its interactive lmao @SadLH
[2022-12-17 23:20:44] <%snoop_frfr> craft bird priest instead
[2022-12-17 23:20:59] <rodrik_harlaw> @snoop_frfr yeah, the shiny new thing was playable - it was a great introduction. I'm not saying they shouldn't have nerfed it after - only that on arrival, it's better that it was op
[2022-12-17 23:21:12] <%+xcesme> I heard your eggs hatched and they are pelicans now
[2022-12-17 23:21:17] <sawyerknight417> No worlds players brought eggs :(
[2022-12-17 23:21:43] <%snoop_frfr> @rodrik_harlaw i mean, unless you're at top legend, dk is fine too, it's just not absurd like rogue/dh/whatever
[2022-12-17 23:21:47] <SadLH> Frost DK when? DansGame
[2022-12-17 23:21:54] <%snoop_frfr> most people who play hearthstone aren't at top legend

[2022-12-17 23:22:00] <SpykoNukov> spell DH is a bunch of fun ! the non questline version seems fair and cool
[2022-12-17 23:22:08] <SadLH> I hope you mean the 30-card version
[2022-12-17 23:22:12] <+goudaboi> Hey Nohands I made an arcane burn mage and went 11-0 to legend, currently 13-3. Any thoughts?
[2022-12-17 23:22:26] <discoveryprime> hey nohands were you familiar with the jailer mage deck you faced yesterday? was it just big spell with jailer, it looked cool

[2022-12-17 23:25:30] <SadLH> @Tinyfred so... 4th? Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:25:42] <+Tinyfred> Odds of me becoming a Mod? LUL
[2022-12-17 23:26:00] <SadLH> you are in the top 367

[2022-12-17 23:26:20] <SadLH> oh.. well that top 4 was suspicious..
[2022-12-17 23:26:21] <+goudaboi> Hey Nohands I added harvester of envy and animate dead to plague priest. Haven’t seen anyone else do it but as long as you don’t play renathal animate dead always resummons harvester of envy, and Svalna can discover more animate dead’s.
[2022-12-17 23:26:28] <sawyerknight417> JAlex used to be my top streamer, but then I began loving myself and you became my top streamer
[2022-12-17 23:26:56] <+datfrogger> @goudaboi but u dont copy cards from opp in plague priest
[2022-12-17 23:27:13] <sawyerknight417> I’m also in your top 1% of chatters
[2022-12-17 23:27:29] <sawyerknight417> JAlex is still my number 2 LUL
[2022-12-17 23:28:26] <+goudaboi> @datfrogger I also added the 2/6 taunt, the 5/6 dragon, the deck already ran identity theft, and you have svalna to discover more identity theft
[2022-12-17 23:28:27] <SadLH> magister.. where? DansGame
[2022-12-17 23:28:45] <%snoop_frfr> harvester steals cards from opponent when you play a copy
[2022-12-17 23:28:51] <+datfrogger> @goudaboi it doesnt run identity theft though..
[2022-12-17 23:28:54] <+datfrogger> ur just playing a different deck
[2022-12-17 23:29:48] <+goudaboi> Yeah but I still have plague and death rattle guys. One of the most fun games was where I stole alexandros after copying it and dealt 60+ damage with his effect doubled

[2022-12-17 23:52:00] <@%lass_leah> I think Astalor is a safe craft, even if he's likely gonna be nerfed. you get the dust back anyways
[2022-12-17 23:52:23] <%WezaRipoto> astalor might be good after nerfs
[2022-12-17 23:52:28] <+SnowMyzer> signature cards just look so bad to me... thoughts?
[2022-12-17 23:52:44] <@%lass_leah> yeah I'm hoping Astalor isn't nerfed, he's a very elegantly designed card
[2022-12-17 23:52:52] <%+gearbeezy> I want to craft Breakfast Priest, but not sure how it will perform in plat.
[2022-12-17 23:52:53] <bob_the69th> @SnowMyzer you have functional eyes!!!
[2022-12-17 23:53:38] <SpykoNukov> huh I thought plague priest was better than quest everywhere

[2022-12-17 23:53:52] <+dnasquared> I'm guessing I need to break down and craft Astalor because it's just too useful in too many decks?

[2022-12-17 23:54:28] <bob_the69th> their win condition is giving you depression
[2022-12-17 23:54:30] <+Biscrits> I want to play DK which enticed me back to HS and then was bad 3 days after the launch.
[2022-12-17 23:54:31] <+dnasquared> More like, it seems like a fairly safe craft at this point with lots of utility?
[2022-12-17 23:55:12] <thegame___na> so he has a harder time playing aroudn the ping
[2022-12-17 23:55:15] <SadLH> so that your opponent doesn't expect it
[2022-12-17 23:55:15] <%rotemv3> Cuz u suck
[2022-12-17 23:55:16] <marveleternalsofficial> so you can have a higher chance of getting an honorable kill
[2022-12-17 23:55:17] <lightfreeze_hs> to bait the elemental?
[2022-12-17 23:55:18] <%+xcesme> to play around plaguespreader mentally

[2022-12-17 23:55:19] <%WezaRipoto> because you hate dealing damage
[2022-12-17 23:55:19] <yugioh3dmaster> to not float on mana 4Head
[2022-12-17 23:55:20] <+dnasquared> So you can be flexible about the size of ping
[2022-12-17 23:55:21] <%+GuildChatter> so you can trick him
[2022-12-17 23:55:22] <SpykoNukov> to be able to get a hinorable kill ?
[2022-12-17 23:55:24] <bob_the69th> cuz you're bad

[2022-12-17 23:55:34] <+testa_87> not easy then to improve HP
[2022-12-17 23:55:38] <+kriscitoo> You have flexibility to deal 5 or 6 damage next turn

[2022-12-17 23:59:15] <ColonelBlabby> technically finley bran does something cause it reverses the order of your hand

[2022-12-17 23:59:43] <lightfreeze_hs> there is a world where priest manages to beatdown the mage while dawngrasp is bottom 5
[2022-12-17 23:59:54] <SpykoNukov> also if you have less cards in deck than in hand brann finnley would reduce your hand right ?
[2022-12-17 23:59:54] <%+xcesme> @lightfreeze_hs there really isnt
