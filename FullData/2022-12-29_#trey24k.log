And Captain Hook was the only lost boy who escape Neverland. Which explains why Peter Pan attacks Captain Hook and tries to kill him. Captain Hook is actually trying to save their lives and bring them back.

[2022-12-29 16:45:11] <%$Apologeticz98> @ZRiderX_ no, it's a laptop CPU with throttled TDP. if he mentioned a desktop 3080, 1st you would be able to use a laptop cpu lol. 2nd Desktop cpus/gpus normally have much higher TDPs and therefore, much higher performance. So I would never suggest a laptop CPU/GPU is "good", Better than nothing? yes, but not good
