[2022-12-22 05:23:07] <Yakousou> @Khaladen As a barb main it is 100% a noobstomper. As soon as I went into high roller, my ass got rolled so much more and that's when you see how weak barb is against good rangers/wizards
[2022-12-22 05:23:07] <%SporkTheWorld> @Richie364 shame, quickshot for me just got me laughed at
[2022-12-22 05:23:11] <%OzymandiasJ> @MacL0ven most good groups have a cleric tho so it's not even that important once you get gear. people swap it off
[2022-12-22 05:23:25] <taz_bruh> felling axe probably best 2h in the game
[2022-12-22 05:23:25] <r4dm4ng> i love playing barb
[2022-12-22 05:23:28] <d8e8> as a ranger, traps need nerf and there needs to be more of a mobility penalty for either firing or reloading. but definitely no to an arrow cap.

[2022-12-22 05:41:21] <%Attckcat> circle gives a reliable map timer
[2022-12-22 05:41:21] <theory_crafter> they really need to reduce the speed of the circle for the second floor... after one room its already time to leave

[2022-12-22 05:43:18] <Yakousou> Maybe keep the circle the way it is but once it gets small enough make it so it doesn't shrink anymore. That way you have all the time you need to fight/loot in those last minutes

[2022-12-22 05:44:03] <d8e8> gotta remember there'll be ppl waiting around to go down to the next level while the circle is closing and devs wanna minimize that time as much as possible. especially considering the dungeon will be 3 floors. we start on the 2nd floor in playtest
[2022-12-22 05:44:06] <%dy_21> give cleric a bubble to shield it a bit, use

[2022-12-22 05:44:13] <%+LusciousTigerAss> Scroll of Divine Light or some nonsense, extends the looting time, make it very rare, or only find in the dungeon

[2022-12-22 07:23:53] <%Angry_Sensei> i think theres a block/attack rating. the higher rating overcomes the lesser
[2022-12-22 07:23:59] <justcarbunkle> too bad you can't swing the book

[2022-12-22 07:40:32] <%Faebianna> isn't their a stat that speeds up interacting with portals, statues and campfires?

[2022-12-22 07:41:00] <%$Chieftina> I hate how you can't see/tell when the zone is going to moves, that should totally be information you have

[2022-12-22 07:41:44] <+Matte_h83> @Faebianna resourcefukness increase interactions. open doors , chests , portals etc. but what do you give up for it... as fighter.
[2022-12-22 07:42:01] <+poobrane> Why did they take out the triple blue portals?
[2022-12-22 07:42:09] <%ovahkeel> there is a second spell slot
[2022-12-22 07:42:12] <just_some_pvp> divine strike is op buff i sugget taking it ;p
[2022-12-22 07:42:12] <justcarbunkle> you can have 2 spell memories
[2022-12-22 07:42:12] <%ovahkeel> that can go in there

[2022-12-22 07:42:19] <%+redriser> They should rework end of circle so portals go away and everyone else fights to the death.  Last group that wins gets out.
[2022-12-22 07:42:21] <c0ldturk3y> if u put spell memorisation on slot onw
[2022-12-22 07:42:23] <%+BigDan1992> you can run a second skill book
[2022-12-22 07:42:33] <%ovahkeel> so if you go to the perk tree, there is another square perk that can go in there so you have 2 spell books
[2022-12-22 07:42:37] <ElonMuskett> thats for if u run 2 spell wheels instead of judgement or sum
[2022-12-22 07:42:38] <$whyde> Greetings @Sequisha
[2022-12-22 07:42:41] <%Faebianna> @matte_h83 true.
[2022-12-22 07:42:42] <just_some_pvp> you got the clutch setup imo this is what i run now you added it
[2022-12-22 07:42:49] <+kronicc1> what does bind do?
[2022-12-22 07:42:51] <Karziel> @Sequisha you can equip a second set of spells to effectively double your number of spells (equip spell memory to both your Q and E)
[2022-12-22 07:42:58] <ElonMuskett> Cleanse makes it to where storm doesnt do dmg im pretty sure @Sequisha
[2022-12-22 07:43:03] <%ovahkeel> i guess it's a "skill" perk, it's called spell memory 2
[2022-12-22 07:43:07] <just_some_pvp> that + damage is big big
[2022-12-22 07:43:12] <%Beakly_> oooo imagine hitting an enemy while anthony is mid-fight
[2022-12-22 07:43:13] <%ovahkeel> but it doesn't give you additional memory, it just lets you have more spells.
[2022-12-22 07:43:17] <%Beakly_> with bind
[2022-12-22 07:43:24] <justcarbunkle> you can also have that preloaded so when you get enough knowledge it will auto u lock
[2022-12-22 07:43:29] <%Danrul> the cleric damage buff is ridiculous on a rogue
[2022-12-22 07:43:38] <+Goobzor> its if you want to bring in more spells you can have a skill that allows you to have 2 spell memory its in perk and skills
[2022-12-22 07:43:49] <Tondsa> what happens to all the stuff when the game closes?
[2022-12-22 07:43:51] <just_some_pvp> Judgement is nice if you comfy with out the aoe clear
[2022-12-22 07:43:56] <%ovahkeel> correct
[2022-12-22 07:43:56] <just_some_pvp> but yeah the aoe is clutch
[2022-12-22 07:44:05] <%ovahkeel> no casty if no have.
[2022-12-22 07:44:11] <%ovahkeel> it's so you can have two of them
[2022-12-22 07:44:11] <%Faebianna> @tondsa hopefully wiped?

[2022-12-22 07:44:23] <just_some_pvp> yep
[2022-12-22 07:44:32] <%+BigDan1992> so you can run more spells
[2022-12-22 07:44:33] <+slingblademmhmm> You would have to apply both of them and then get both trees
[2022-12-22 07:44:36] <%g_mask> you can take off the q to have both
[2022-12-22 07:44:38] <geybino> !dawg
[2022-12-22 07:44:38] <%Beakly_> yeah you can just have 2 spell wheels to choose from in raid
[2022-12-22 07:44:39] <Stinkmeat> just lets you memorize more spells at once
[2022-12-22 07:44:41] <Silencing_Machine> if you use both
[2022-12-22 07:44:41] <%+BigDan1992> you run both
[2022-12-22 07:44:41] <ElonMuskett> replace q with it
[2022-12-22 07:44:43] <+Wyrd_Owl> it's a second one to give you more slots
[2022-12-22 07:44:44] <%ovahkeel> it doesn't give you more memory or anything it just lets you have a second skill tree, so one skill tree is q radial menu and the other is e radial memory
[2022-12-22 07:44:45] <+moosE3knucklE> you have to have them both equiped to open them both up
[2022-12-22 07:44:46] <c0ldturk3y> put it on q
[2022-12-22 07:44:46] <+ImPreposterous> Just put it in the other slot to the left
[2022-12-22 07:44:46] <geybino> what the dawg doin
[2022-12-22 07:44:53] <just_some_pvp> your spells are on "2" right now
[2022-12-22 07:44:54] <%Tuna__00> 2 has gotta be better than 1 right?
[2022-12-22 07:44:55] <+Goobzor> you can bring in the other spells if you wanted to be more of a caster. vs having 1 skill
[2022-12-22 07:44:58] <Tondsa> @Faebianna i hope so too
[2022-12-22 07:45:00] <just_some_pvp> if you equip one your shits empty

[2022-12-22 07:45:13] <%ovahkeel> yea, i don't know why you would need two trees. lol. maybe they are gonna add them

[2022-12-22 07:45:21] <just_some_pvp> should use spell memory 2 (thats the preset you have)

[2022-12-22 16:24:26] <%BinaryLynx> barb against ranger is the saddest thing ever if ranger is not a noob
[2022-12-22 16:24:27] <+Nivendo> @AdamJamez During a dev interview the dev seemed very happy with the idea of a blood hunter. I think we'll see that sooner rather than later too
[2022-12-22 16:24:27] <SloppiPapii> movement speed is one of the best stats on any class forsure.
[2022-12-22 16:24:28] <AdamJamez> only way a rouge is beating a barb is if they miss there initial swing honestly
[2022-12-22 16:24:30] <+MadBinxx> When you can start your big ass swing far away and run up right as you hit sounds good for begging those big dinks.
[2022-12-22 16:24:31] <htims> i didn't mess with felling axe too much, started early with a nice bardiche and got rolling.  does felling axe work better in tight quarters?

[2022-12-22 16:24:48] <+dtp1337> I found a +3 all attributes maul

[2022-12-22 16:28:06] <%BinaryLynx> So my take is that you carry a horseman AND a felling axe to deal with both fighters/barbs and the rest. also you don't shy away from fisting people down and throwing green axes at rangers. greens fly fast and far

[2022-12-22 17:31:34] <LeviticusT> Ranger has gotta be one of if not the best class in this play test
[2022-12-22 17:31:36] <gamez_brown> @dtp1337 the best usable shield

[2022-12-22 17:31:40] <+Nivendo> Ranger needs to not have the movespeed of a rogue and I think the class would be fine :/
[2022-12-22 17:31:41] <Go420rd> bigger sheild anything is better then buckler
[2022-12-22 17:31:41] <%+turkeygoblins> @theory_crafter solo cleric is fine, all classes are. it's actually quite strong

[2022-12-22 18:46:46] <Vestosterone> Just an FYI @Sequisha. With triple shot you can use it with 0 arrows left and it automatically reloads your quiver

[2022-12-22 18:47:02] <+iamSpacedad> arrow shotgun for close targets sounds like
[2022-12-22 18:47:04] <adrunknugget> if you can hit a multi-shot point blank
[2022-12-22 18:47:04] <%Hyene_Turgescente> spread but close range aka shotgun
[2022-12-22 18:47:06] <Go420rd> thats the ticket
[2022-12-22 18:47:06] <ZionCzan> you can Point blank it for good dps

[2022-12-22 18:47:17] <Petzylq> and if out of ammo the triple shot will refund 3 more after triple shot<
[2022-12-22 18:47:17] <+TheV_07> quickshot  reloads your bow @Sequisha
[2022-12-22 18:47:24] <lebubbles> i use that 5 arrow skill as a shotgun when a rogue or barbarian is on my face
[2022-12-22 18:47:24] <glorgashack> @sequisha the spread shit is great against melee in pvp, point blank all 5 arrows hit chest

[2022-12-22 18:47:46] <AdamJamez> shoot all 5 arrows then use quickshot for free reload
[2022-12-22 18:47:47] <+JimmyJimJimJammers> yeah using quickshot at 0 arrows is super nice, you got 3 extra shots afterwards cause free reload

[2022-12-22 21:03:31] <+aberman89> feel like they need to increase spell knowledge requirement on ignite or haste or invis or something so you cant grab those 3 + magic missle and fireball
[2022-12-22 21:03:36] <Harry_Whodini> His name was UnbalancedGarbage OMEGALUL
[2022-12-22 21:03:45] <+aberman89> you wanna run the stabby stab you lose your fireball/MM

[2022-12-22 21:04:01] <+WolfManZach> @Aviate27 I think it's more so cheap that wizards have an invis that they can just run with
[2022-12-22 21:04:17] <+Aviate27> yeah because they can invis and move as wizard, rogue can barely do that
[2022-12-22 21:04:26] <%Maz0hyst> atpCap

[2022-12-22 21:05:05] <+aberman89> i dont think its a huge deal but right now they can keep all their ranged damage and be a great melee
[2022-12-22 21:05:06] <+Aviate27> you can move more than 10 steps in 4 seconds
[2022-12-22 21:05:06] <DarkoVII> ah okay only 4 seconds is pretty low, its like 30 for a rogue
[2022-12-22 21:05:08] <+eggsmasher> and he has speed while running around
[2022-12-22 21:05:08] <%+BabySheepLorD> does sequish have a guy named sirdoinksalot

[2022-12-22 21:05:35] <+eggsmasher> @DarkoVII its 30 seconds but a rogue can only move 10 steps crouched or slow walking

[2022-12-22 21:15:01] <+waldanator> if you use a crossbow that have -50 or less move speed it doesn't put it on the ground to reload which makes it essentially as fast as a recurve with the crossbow perk on

[2022-12-22 21:25:37] <ImTrin> yea he was low, you hit him with arrows earlier
[2022-12-22 21:25:38] <%+WeatheredMachine> @Sequisha How would you like a 69dmg purple Windlass with +4.1% armour pen, +1.2% buff duration bonus and +5 weapon damage? Idk if that's any good.

[2022-12-22 21:27:24] <kekdubliu> rangers r f'ed inside these tight corridors
[2022-12-22 21:27:24] <JurgenNW> a lone ranger is so vulnerable, makes sense though
[2022-12-22 21:27:29] <%$Thalbarin> @silentstormpt this is dark and darker and the bow is op

[2022-12-22 21:27:42] <+Aviate27> bow isnt OP...
[2022-12-22 21:27:46] <%+silentstormpt> yh but you do need to multi HS
[2022-12-22 21:27:48] <+HawkMan4k> honestly out of all the classes ranger is my favorite by far, especially solo. Arrming sword secondary
[2022-12-22 21:27:54] <%+WeatheredMachine> Alrighty! I'll sort you out between games then, I'm in a match myself.
[2022-12-22 21:27:56] <%adrunknugget> for sure would one shot another ranger or a rogue
[2022-12-22 21:27:57] <+Aviate27> not anymore OP than wizard lightning 1 shotting anyways
[2022-12-22 21:27:57] <%+silentstormpt> on EfT dmg model it would be a single HS
[2022-12-22 21:28:01] <JurgenNW> A bow is really more teamplay or assassination.
[2022-12-22 21:28:03] <+Srule38> a wild chinny appears
[2022-12-22 21:28:06] <MuMo_> @JurgenNW no that much, you can just run and people wont catch you, but if u stand greedy to shoot well yes you can die

[2022-12-22 22:36:50] <+hasturblaster> and pre-med is wack and hopefully it will get changed in tarkov. sayin'

[2022-12-22 22:37:41] <Draktyr_Gaming> in this play test is the fighter better overall compared to barb?
[2022-12-22 22:38:09] <lavions> chest piece is risky?

[2022-12-22 22:38:14] <%+blazinmonkey> @Draktyr_Gaming its a more tankier fighter than the strong barb and the light weight fast rogue
[2022-12-22 22:38:16] <The_Balbarian> @hasturblaster but i always take painkillers every 15 minutes throughout the day. You know, just in case i stub my toe at some point pugBlank
[2022-12-22 22:38:22] <+hasturblaster> @Draktyr_Gaming i feel like with gear, the barb is better. but starting out, fighter is easier

[2022-12-22 22:38:39] <Draktyr_Gaming> ok thank you @blazinmonkey  @hasturblaster

[2022-12-22 22:38:41] <Cheeseborger1> I think yes but they both have some strength and weaknesses that are different. the barb fesr and door smashing is p huge @Draktyr_Gaming
[2022-12-22 22:38:51] <%+Smoke_Cohhilition> @Arlechinu yeah barb can dual wield but the move speed hurts especially when your attacking... hard to stay on top of people
