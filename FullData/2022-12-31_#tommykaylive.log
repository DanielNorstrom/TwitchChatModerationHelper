[2022-12-31 14:15:40] <%thestranger216> @wolfpoops well, the pure acknowledgment may not even be a deal-breaker. It is mainly about sharing copyrighted material with an indefinite amount of people. So whoever actually hosts the stream has the most problems. If tommy just acknowledges the stream, but doesn‚Äôt strictly ‚Äûshare‚Äú the copyrighted material himself, he could be fine. (This is naturally not legal advice)

[2022-12-31 16:55:07] <Salter05> Rising up isn‚Äôt that hard, as long as you have a strong power base and followers among the other clans who are willing to join your faction. I did it recently, managed to get the entire western part of sturgia with me, it‚Äôs great for rp and definently doable. @tommykaylive
