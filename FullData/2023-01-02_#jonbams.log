[2023-01-02 15:48:59] <%Thedarkvet53> Cheer100 Cheer100 Alright, heres my take.  Your dads dog most likely has osteoarthritis.  Which is arthritis of any joint in the body.  When they loose ability to use their back legs its cause the arthritis is in their spine causing inflammation and pressure on the spinal cord and slowing messages from the brain.  Your dad most likely did order something that had natural anti-inflammatory properties which then allowed to open up the spinal cord and relieve pain.  I almost thought you were going

[2023-01-02 15:53:33] <%Thedarkvet53> Cheer100 Cheer100 It is odd that he didn't prescribe anything.  I'm guessing they did bloodwork and xrays on your dog which should of revealed the arthritis.  Yorkie's are also commonly known for having luxating patellas and collapsing trachea.  So throwing an anti-inflammatory at a little dog never hurts.  Have your dad ask his veterinarian about Meloxicam.  Its great for the little guys

[2023-01-02 16:39:50] <%OragamiSwamy> So the theory of a black hole is that at the point where the vacume pulls faster than the speed of light, so light cannot escape it. Does that mean that movement still exists within, but you simply can only move in one direction regardless of relative direction.

The second was in 1946, entitled  One World or None: A Report to the Public on the Full Meaning of the Atomic Bomb, was written, in part, by Einstein and argued that we should never use atomic weapons.

[2023-01-02 17:58:18] <%$PrimeBlackDodo> @lpcbx seriously though, Java is still doing better than bedrock
[2023-01-02 17:58:20] <%$Goode_Cheeseburgers> but java yes
[2023-01-02 17:58:30] <%ODiggidy> You get both
[2023-01-02 17:58:30] <FrogFeathers0> And y’all want him to dupe TNT 🧨
[2023-01-02 17:58:32] <tetrobit> agreed. bedrock is only good with friends and it's still buggy
[2023-01-02 17:58:32] <%$Goode_Cheeseburgers> if you buy java you get bedrock free
[2023-01-02 17:58:36] <%$rackyjacks> People on twitch don’t have friends

[2023-01-02 17:58:51] <%dasraizer> bedrock also C++ :)
[2023-01-02 17:58:57] <%thatTune> Isn't it if you buy java you get bedrock as well? I remember M$ doing that. Maybe it was just a promotion though or something.

[2023-01-02 17:59:13] <%$Goode_Cheeseburgers> @lpcbx if you buy java you should get bedrock free
[2023-01-02 17:59:15] <%BubbaGump_72> bedrock has potion duping with drip stone, and movable entities. that being said java

[2023-01-02 18:10:29] <@%^Nightbot> This giant hole is for a giant Wither Skeleton farm. The hole was started in December 2019, but got sidetracked. This was cleared BY HAND (and a lot of repairing of tools). This hole's chunks were generated before the 1.16 update, before Netherite was a thing (SO no netherite was found in the hole). Jon did not copy Ph1lza, this is "standard" practice of clearing every spawn surface for a spawn farm. The floor is spawn protected via a layer of glass.

[2023-01-02 18:10:34] <@%^Nightbot> Lets catch everyone up. John decides to build epic wool farm from bedrock to sky limit. He's fat so he doesn't want to dig it out and decides he needs TNT. But then realizes he needs to fix the creeper farm by lowering it 64 blocks to bedrock. But again he's fat and needs gunpowder for TNT. so to make farm more efficient he wants tinted glass and finds 4 geodes close to each other but needs to connect it to the nether highway.

[2023-01-02 18:49:00] <%editor_> one interesting example is that people update the technology they used to find out. people who heard on radio and newspapers remembered watching it on television.

[2023-01-02 19:00:41] <AdrianCard3nas> maybe because of the kids

[2023-01-02 19:01:00] <+ODBeefalo> @JonBams it was funny in a weird way as a canadian for years... We were pretty much the ONLY country not a suspect. like "Nah, Canada we know you wouldn't do it. we trust you. but those fuckin english looking hella suspicious."

[2023-01-02 19:02:10] <%+SoCalGuy1320> In a room full of children, I'm sure it was a wave of emotion that came over him.
[2023-01-02 19:02:11] <%$PrimeBlackDodo> probably because it was public and it was on air so you have a problem
[2023-01-02 19:02:22] <%neonrainbowfish> Almost like he knew he wasn't in danger.

[2023-01-02 19:02:32] <%+allgripgc8t> they did that on scary movie 4
[2023-01-02 19:02:35] <%$Richmon117> @Richmon117 I'm saying the terrorists, the plan was to hit the white house
[2023-01-02 19:02:36] <%Mackapoot> @HashtagTac I mean like, they'd know if a plane was off course headed to a school. Presumably.
