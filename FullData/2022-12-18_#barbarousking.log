[2022-12-18 23:00:26] <%FrenchFryApocalypse> Hunting Blades OOOO
[2022-12-18 23:00:26] <%+Droooogie> shit room
[2022-12-18 23:00:29] <%+FoolsPrime> get that aoe and pull in and they can do work
[2022-12-18 23:00:49] <ruby_sunrise> I think I just suck with blade rifts. I don't know how to use them, like, mechanically
[2022-12-18 23:00:53] <%potapeno> what heat?
[2022-12-18 23:00:57] <%potapeno> oh 38
[2022-12-18 23:00:59] <ruby_sunrise> the enemies are all jumping around
[2022-12-18 23:01:09] <%potapeno> yeah i just saw it in the corner
[2022-12-18 23:01:10] <%WrathOfBom> I finally beat Hades‚Äôs extreme measures. Once lol
[2022-12-18 23:01:13] <%EndlesslyAwake> is 38 high?
[2022-12-18 23:01:18] <+toughToes> have you ever tried to steal the merchant gold bag?
[2022-12-18 23:01:21] <%HeyMisterJack> 38 is very high
[2022-12-18 23:01:25] <%+Droooogie> nice

[2022-12-18 23:01:33] <%FrenchFryApocalypse> :O
[2022-12-18 23:01:45] <%Alfonso_Khan> The_Dog_Rules tecito7HI
[2022-12-18 23:01:49] <%+Droooogie> @EndlesslyAwake beyond 32 heat its fucking hard
[2022-12-18 23:01:55] <%polyhydride> hanksiLove
[2022-12-18 23:01:56] <+toughToes> I can only do like 12
[2022-12-18 23:02:05] <wolrammer08> I know the bow can be strong but I never could get into it
[2022-12-18 23:02:05] <%+jaspion00> 32 is basically the highest the game expects you to go
[2022-12-18 23:02:07] <%EndlesslyAwake> i've never played the game, and only seen barb play once before
[2022-12-18 23:02:12] <%EndlesslyAwake> it look ssuper cool
[2022-12-18 23:02:21] <%xodingusox> stoked to see you playing this again!
[2022-12-18 23:02:24] <+toughToes> it‚Äôs such a fun game. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.
[2022-12-18 23:02:28] <%+Rozzy15> its worth playing for sure
[2022-12-18 23:02:32] <%Morbo_> There isn't even a Steam Achievement for 32 heat
[2022-12-18 23:02:33] <%+Droooogie> @EndlesslyAwake you should play it, so addictive KEKW
[2022-12-18 23:02:34] <%$RAVpanda037> @EndlesslyAwake it is. you should get it moistEvil
[2022-12-18 23:02:35] <%sergeant_sly> whats Barbs PB with bows?
[2022-12-18 23:02:37] <Screegar> It's the best in its class
[2022-12-18 23:02:47] <Spikeynator> wich game doesnt have issues... lfsQ
[2022-12-18 23:02:50] <%loudtenor> A review put it: "If you don't like Hades you will never like rogue-lites"
[2022-12-18 23:02:52] <%+kll21> this and gungeon are my favorite roughe likes
[2022-12-18 23:02:55] <%+thethorgot> FISH moon2NOO
[2022-12-18 23:02:55] <Alili_1996> my only real gripe is no floor variety
[2022-12-18 23:02:57] <%$Mi4_Slayer> but blade rift builds are less hard to get going then meme beam, meme beam you need to have chaos and Artemis to give you +1 cast with the quick refresh cast perk
[2022-12-18 23:02:58] <%+Rozzy15> and its got a big three headed doggo peepoHappy
[2022-12-18 23:03:00] <%WrathOfBom> Highest i got so far is 16 so I got another skelly statue hehe. Not sure i can get to 32
[2022-12-18 23:03:02] <%$kari0mart> So is Hades a 10/10 game or just shy of that mark
[2022-12-18 23:03:03] <+toughToes> you can tell the people who made it are true artists.
[2022-12-18 23:03:04] <%$archang3l_media> After realizing, I'm not good enough for 12+ heat, my motivation for hades sunk a bit, but I'm really looking forward for Hades II
[2022-12-18 23:03:04] <%erojas1297> playing hades is almost a must
[2022-12-18 23:03:05] <%+Agent_J801> Double digit gets challenging, 32 is "you're really good", beyond 32 is barbChad territory
[2022-12-18 23:03:09] <$Poledra_Val> Not gonna lie Barb i get the feeling you would get a kick out of Bastion
[2022-12-18 23:03:15] <%higHChloride> "People still making rougelites like 'Hades' doesn't already exist"
[2022-12-18 23:03:15] <+bigmeatsunday> 5/7, perfect score
[2022-12-18 23:03:21] <%$KingJayEagle> I recommend Hades to literally everyone I know that plays these types of games.
[2022-12-18 23:03:31] <+toughToes> The amount of voiceover work in this game is utterly impressive
[2022-12-18 23:03:31] <%$sloth_moves> i hope in 2 they have like multiple choices
[2022-12-18 23:03:31] <$Poledra_Val> ah good stuff
[2022-12-18 23:03:32] <%$Mi4_Slayer> That one more region could have been an alternate path
[2022-12-18 23:03:33] <$Poledra_Val> look forward to it

[2022-12-18 23:03:47] <%RIFFOSAURUS> Im excited for the 24hr stream
[2022-12-18 23:03:52] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Which bow do we have chat?
[2022-12-18 23:03:55] <%+AnimusAja> Supergiant, outside of Pyre, makes 10/10 games. Bastion and Transistor are both amazing, and Darren Korb did amazing music for those too.
[2022-12-18 23:04:00] <%$Mi4_Slayer> I bought bastion for cheap, but looking at the footage... it looks like it plays super clunckly
[2022-12-18 23:04:02] <%+kll21> @BarbarousKing  my first day off for winter break is the 23rd so im going to fuck up my sleep schedule and stay up with you :)
[2022-12-18 23:04:03] <%HeyMisterJack> bastion narrator vs DD narrator
[2022-12-18 23:04:04] <%Taniel2Shot_> Lernies EM form fucks me up LUL
[2022-12-18 23:04:08] <TriSalt> It's so good even the devs wanted a sequel. trisalHMM
[2022-12-18 23:04:17] <%Alfonso_Khan> yeah this is the worst version
[2022-12-18 23:04:20] <%+bayetovsky> I feel that people that played Hades before playing Bastion don't fully enjoy the game because hades refined the playstyle LUL
[2022-12-18 23:04:25] <%thrawx> I wish Asterius' charge had a tighter hitbox, so many times it feels like it glitches around the side of an obstacle
[2022-12-18 23:04:28] <%playmykrat0s> Carl loves hades, it was so fun watching get better and better.
[2022-12-18 23:04:34] <$KurOhki> peepoClap
[2022-12-18 23:04:36] <%brunchy1> nice
[2022-12-18 23:04:39] <+toughToes> is bastion for the switch?
[2022-12-18 23:04:39] <%$Mi4_Slayer> I hate this version of the arena so much
[2022-12-18 23:04:39] <%ecstaticbroccoli> which aspect bow do we have?
[2022-12-18 23:04:45] <%+kingbobmaniii> Oooh Hades

[2022-12-18 23:05:10] <%$sloth_moves> replease carl with barb and i agree
[2022-12-18 23:05:12] <%+kingbobmaniii> Barb has always kinda been the best to ever do it NODDERS
[2022-12-18 23:05:13] <%Morbo_> Not a while to beat it
[2022-12-18 23:05:16] <%Morbo_> Yeah
[2022-12-18 23:05:17] <%+Rozzy15> yea i just made that up, i missed the beginning of Hades
[2022-12-18 23:05:25] <%argyle_gargoyle37> poe might be the same way
[2022-12-18 23:05:28] <Alili_1996> I think Hades biggest strength is Weapon variety
[2022-12-18 23:05:31] <+toughToes> The game kind of starts when you beat it
[2022-12-18 23:05:36] <%$KingJayEagle> Hades 2 looks like it's going to be dope

[2022-12-18 23:06:19] <%+thedrewbixcube> I need to play the game at least once so when barb says things like, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go hammer‚Äù I know what the heck that means.
[2022-12-18 23:06:24] <%+kingbobmaniii> OOOO Triple shot
[2022-12-18 23:06:30] <%+Rozzy15> love triple shot OOOP

[2022-12-18 23:07:00] <%ecstaticbroccoli> is this your highest heat on Aspect of Rama?
[2022-12-18 23:07:02] <%+kingbobmaniii> Triple shot normally on the bow isn't great but on Rama it becomes OOOO
[2022-12-18 23:07:05] <%$corignis> I love hades and barb but it's so hard to understand what his happening on screen at points
[2022-12-18 23:07:17] <%ryogrande> @thedrewbixcube the pictures over the doors represent what boon u will get after clearing next room
[2022-12-18 23:07:38] <%+kingbobmaniii> I hope they fix, or at least have an option to turn down Visual Noise
[2022-12-18 23:07:46] <%$Mi4_Slayer> @corignis you really need to focus to follow kinda like some dbz shit xD

[2022-12-18 23:12:34] <%Alfonso_Khan> elysium doing elysium things
[2022-12-18 23:12:39] <%+GlaceonYo> @jaspion00 Until the tunnels CBT the shit out of you with the worst rooms over and over
[2022-12-18 23:12:40] <%ecstaticbroccoli> blood and darkness
[2022-12-18 23:12:48] <%tuntunteddybear1> the bow guys suck
[2022-12-18 23:13:02] <%Vic_Vega> Depends how many shield fuckers you get
[2022-12-18 23:13:04] <%betooth> I lose more runs to Elysium than anywhere else
[2022-12-18 23:13:04] <%+jwowillo> Chat, what should I order for dinner tonight? I don't want to cook, and want to be a lazy blob.
[2022-12-18 23:13:07] <%+TkoRDemon> barbGabnon the lil chariots are jerks
[2022-12-18 23:13:07] <%+Zunahme> yay he stayed on after the last rom hack. I thought we were going to use him
[2022-12-18 23:13:07] <+justdoitbuck> elysium is a damage gate
[2022-12-18 23:13:07] <%Alfonso_Khan> oh boy lsrFine
[2022-12-18 23:13:11] <corybrowntricks> Imagine if you beat this game and got to the credits screen and it just said "Hey Deez Nutz..."
[2022-12-18 23:13:12] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Splitters possibly even more annoying than bow guys
[2022-12-18 23:13:12] <Ghrian_Abel> Barb's favourite: WITCHES Kappa
[2022-12-18 23:13:14] <%+Zunahme> lose*
[2022-12-18 23:13:15] <%+d4t0m3k> yeah, it was
[2022-12-18 23:13:15] <+toughToes> The other problem is that I focus too much on trying to kill enemies with a special in order to get to get+2 hp back
[2022-12-18 23:13:16] <+justdoitbuck> DPS check
[2022-12-18 23:13:17] <%+lamda00> elysium lets you know if your build is good enough
[2022-12-18 23:13:21] <%+geedub89> I wish I could play this again fir the first time
[2022-12-18 23:13:23] <%$Mi4_Slayer> also forever fuck shield dudes
[2022-12-18 23:13:23] <%$continuum12> @jwowillo Checken wings.
[2022-12-18 23:13:24] <%FrothieCoffee> i hate the fucking witches, especially in elysium
[2022-12-18 23:13:24] <$Organe_Orange> lol, the mid area with the lava floors hit hard if you play on MK
[2022-12-18 23:13:26] <%$Mi4_Slayer> hate them
[2022-12-18 23:13:27] <%+GlaceonYo> Doucheus out of chariot is a huge pain for your first time running that boss
[2022-12-18 23:13:35] <%+jwowillo> @continuum12 fuck yeah I haven't had those in ages
[2022-12-18 23:13:36] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Fast shield dudes ugh
[2022-12-18 23:13:37] <$IsntEvenMyFinalForm> very punishing when you dont know the enemies here
[2022-12-18 23:13:39] <%$sloth_moves> i like how they make it so its super hard to beat the game on the first go
[2022-12-18 23:13:41] <Ghrian_Abel> Fun fact, I got my Twitch recap and I am in the top 5% chatters in Barb's streams even though I almost only tune in for Hades lol
[2022-12-18 23:13:47] <%+jacketslow> love this game
[2022-12-18 23:13:50] <%+jwowillo> @continuum12 barbCheers
[2022-12-18 23:13:54] <odestrupto> You don't get the double status damage buff because of heat right?
[2022-12-18 23:14:01] <%$continuum12> @jwowillo barbCheers
[2022-12-18 23:14:02] <Ravenspawn2000> I wanna play this and hollow knight but have to 100% Mass Effect 3 first
[2022-12-18 23:14:09] <%Fluffboll> Elysium isn't a difficulty spike, it's a brick wall. Last area is cake in comparison
[2022-12-18 23:14:14] <%Vic_Vega> I haven't gotten the EM3 fight figured out quite yet

[2022-12-18 23:14:28] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Nothing makes me madder than when someone calls me a blackguard
[2022-12-18 23:14:29] <%+geedub89> what effect is causing that box thing over their heads?
[2022-12-18 23:14:30] <Ghrian_Abel> @Fluffboll Agreed, Styx is piss easy

[2022-12-18 23:14:54] <Ravenspawn2000> @pigmanny yes, platinum/100% 1 and 2, just finished genophage in ME3
[2022-12-18 23:14:54] <%$Brimah> Hermes Dodge did a lot, many near misses
[2022-12-18 23:14:54] <%$tylernol7> @geedub89 thats shared suffering, its from the bow aspect
[2022-12-18 23:14:54] <%+lamda00> too easy for barb hehe

[2022-12-18 23:15:24] <%+geedub89> @tylernol7 as you can see, I use the bow a lot.

[2022-12-18 23:15:28] <%+Rozzy15> lets go 3 sack
[2022-12-18 23:15:29] <Ghrian_Abel> Greater Evasion is amazing
[2022-12-18 23:15:33] <Ghrian_Abel> Best Hermes boon
[2022-12-18 23:15:40] <MrZeev> The most skulls I cleared was 8 with the bow and special poison attack. LuvOops
[2022-12-18 23:15:44] <@%$DanTheVP> Those are the boons that MMO players know are great
[2022-12-18 23:15:46] <@%$DanTheVP> barbLUL
[2022-12-18 23:15:48] <%betooth> Evasion is always a super strong but super boring stat in videogames
[2022-12-18 23:15:50] <%$tylernol7> @geedub89 its a hidden aspect, not as common, all good
[2022-12-18 23:15:52] <%manfred_bratwurst> hermes dodge with pushing the festher makes the game a joke on high difficulty
[2022-12-18 23:15:52] <%$KingJayEagle> I grab Greater Evasion 100% of the time that I see it.
[2022-12-18 23:15:57] <%+IlllIIIlllIlIlIIllllIIIlI> 5 sack as a welcome back fuck you
[2022-12-18 23:15:58] <%+sassysab920> Nothing makes my body hurt more than mashing buttons in hades

[2022-12-18 23:16:28] <%+geedub89> @tylernol7 oh I have it, I don't think I have ever used it. I am SO bad with the bow. My go to is splash dash, bow doesn't agree with that well haha.
[2022-12-18 23:16:30] <%$sloth_moves> do you have the skill tree memorized?
[2022-12-18 23:16:35] <%Fluffboll> @Mi4_Slayer Been awhile since I've played and never beat the game higher than 36 heat but time is the only issue I have in Styx. 5 tunnels is a bitch
