[2022-12-10 21:03:08] <%AslanGrants> I think it's not so much as it's not normalized, it's that the predatory business culture of America has made people too defensive.

[2022-12-10 21:21:04] <%$Dio444777> playing healer teaches you not to take unnecessary damage as a dps because you learn how much harder it is to heal when people are standing in aoes and such
