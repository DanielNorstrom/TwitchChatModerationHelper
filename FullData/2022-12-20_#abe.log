[2022-12-20 02:52:27] <untruthfully> im pretty sure how iskall explained it is u take 83% less damage then u would without the defense
[2022-12-20 02:52:28] <%PaneHS> so them more u have the bigger diference every % makes
[2022-12-20 02:52:38] <mmdonuts> it takes in to account block chance and crit chance, so it's hard to tell
[2022-12-20 02:52:45] <Unknown17z> The increments at higher % is a lot lower is what i remember

[2022-12-20 04:14:16] <%+5th_Alice> I think it's because the proficency is something you work on that's why the odds are different from the gear inside vaults

[2022-12-20 04:16:14] <%+5th_Alice> like when you unlock T4 you don't get T1 anymore or something like that
[2022-12-20 04:17:18] <glacor_ow> yeah i guess it depends on just how far the late game goes
[2022-12-20 04:17:30] <glacor_ow> cause what the level caps at 100 now but then they have the greed level thing or w.e

[2022-12-20 07:59:26] <%zeipherr> @LaLaBriar TFT is like. each character has a trait and class. You gotta buy characters in the shop to level them up. and combine items to give to certain characters. the traits and classes are on the left hand. Where you see Underground, Brawler, Duelist, getting a certain amount for each will give bonus stats.
[2022-12-20 07:59:42] <%zeipherr> i think thats the easiest way I can describe it more indepth.
