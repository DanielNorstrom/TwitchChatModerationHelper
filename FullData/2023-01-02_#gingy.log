[2023-01-02 02:08:50] <samxdesu> Gingy one thing that stuck with me that I think a lot about, is your origins, I wont go into details but when you said you would cry on stream and the way you forged yourself back together. so inspiring I think about it a lot.

[2023-01-02 02:38:47] <+toohigh4this20> The reasoning behind the ban stems from an act carried out during a December 29 broadcast. A member of the development team wearing a balaclava picked up an unloaded pistol, cocked the weapon, and proceeded to pull the trigger with the barrel pressed firmly against the side of his head.  Labeled as ‘self-destructive behavior’ in the Twitch Community Guidelines, the individual in question acted in clear violation of the rules and inevitably got the official Battlestate Games channel banned.

[2023-01-02 04:48:41] <%olternaut> Map knowledge helps but you better know how to shoot and when to be aggresive.....and when to run away! :D
[2023-01-02 04:48:41] <+thiccboynationrick> @blackmonte187 pick one map. Customs or shoreline and run it offline/practice mode until you know it like the back of your hand. Then you’ll only need to improve clicking on heads. Plus early game guns and ammo are bad. Took me a few seasons to get kinda ok

[2023-01-02 05:07:49] <%+Alpha_Assault> the sniper version is bent so the sight can mount on top

[2023-01-02 05:46:10] <PimpSlippers> if he knows the quest he may just be checking the spot just in case. i check there when passing through

[2023-01-02 06:10:22] <+toohigh4this20> The reasoning behind the ban stems from an act carried out during a December 29 broadcast. A member of the development team wearing a balaclava picked up an unloaded pistol, cocked the weapon, and proceeded to pull the trigger with the barrel pressed firmly against the side of his head.  Labeled as ‘self-destructive behavior’ in the Twitch Community Guidelines, the individual in question acted in clear violation of the rules and inevitably got the official Battlestate Games channel banned.

[2023-01-02 06:18:42] <+Im_Deano> If you invite someone to form a group, and then just start searching for a raid before they join, it makes your scav queue time normal

[2023-01-02 07:10:50] <botdul31> @maxderman447 Pestily used to on his raid series I believe
[2023-01-02 07:10:53] <+bludfrt> highest ive seen is 350k not sure what that even was
[2023-01-02 07:11:00] <maxcherry6> what is your favorite color
[2023-01-02 07:11:09] <pronominal_tv> she is part korean
[2023-01-02 07:11:16] <+maxderman447> but like at start of wipe
[2023-01-02 07:11:23] <+Rhune> Smoke does
[2023-01-02 07:11:26] <%+Jay_Vie> @maxderman447 i think Sheef is on standard
[2023-01-02 07:11:37] <tEhrOfLeR> Pest is doing hardcore this wipe too, hence he's not doing a raid series
[2023-01-02 07:11:38] <%redskinlgnd> I seen some streamers starting with hardcore accounts that were smaller
[2023-01-02 07:11:41] <@%IGotBurgerz> You're going woods
[2023-01-02 07:11:42] <Majician> Smoke is doing a standard playthrough

[2023-01-02 07:11:55] <PookieVideo> They use the reflection to see when you enter the raid and take a change on being in the right one
[2023-01-02 07:11:59] <@%IGotBurgerz> Maybe Snoreline

[2023-01-02 07:12:21] <Stacose> If Pestily does do a Raid series he films it while not streaming and it just goes to YouTube

[2023-01-02 07:49:06] <doomiedee> what hes talking about is with your repair stat gives the armor you fix certain perks and adds resale value
[2023-01-02 07:49:08] <+LookItsHunter> @Vanir112 You have an ultrawide? That may be why\
[2023-01-02 07:49:08] <+Vanir112> @Vanir112 That's my point. Tarkov chooses its framerate based on lunar phases for all I can tell.
[2023-01-02 07:49:18] <deathbeforedismount0> what are the best expensive items to sell to Skier....like moonshine works well with Jaeger

[2023-01-02 07:57:34] <CaptainStevio> @PapaTomss yeah it's due to the amount of players attempting to queue in at the same time, there aren't enough actual game servers to get all the players into matches

[2023-01-02 09:16:16] <+toohigh4this20> yall are cracked.. LEDx in mantis.. is RNG.. ricochets are RNG..

[2023-01-02 09:16:21] <pronominal_tv> <3
[2023-01-02 09:16:22] <cmasterisk> IT IS RNG! It is based on the percentage of how things can happen in the game
[2023-01-02 09:16:23] <%+MystifiD> All loot is RNG...just to start. plus like gingy said the helmets, then add in gun jams.  80% of this game is RNG
[2023-01-02 09:16:25] <+thejokerofsocal> Yall dont understand how RNG works, the moment u start putting 5% chance of X happening u now have RNG in your game cause a generator randomly Generates a number to see if it falls in that 5% range

[2023-01-02 09:16:37] <trippycoop> It’s rng because they can’t imitate the angle a bullet hits a helmet to make it ricochet so it’s just rng instead

[2023-01-02 10:14:13] <+toohigh4this20> The reasoning behind the ban stems from an act carried out during a December 29 broadcast. A member of the development team wearing a balaclava picked up an unloaded pistol, cocked the weapon, and proceeded to pull the trigger with the barrel pressed firmly against the side of his head.  Labeled as ‘self-destructive behavior’ in the Twitch Community Guidelines, the individual in question acted in clear violation of the rules and inevitably got the official Battlestate Games channel banned.

[2023-01-02 10:43:10] <ahhhgeeezrick> Okay cool
[2023-01-02 10:43:10] <+toohigh4this20> The reasoning behind the ban stems from an act carried out during a December 29 broadcast. A member of the development team wearing a balaclava picked up an unloaded pistol, cocked the weapon, and proceeded to pull the trigger with the barrel pressed firmly against the side of his head.  Labeled as ‘self-destructive behavior’ in the Twitch Community Guidelines, the individual in question acted in clear violation of the rules and inevitably got the official Battlestate Games channel banned.

[2023-01-02 12:05:42] <$Apoc4lypse2> I've never gotten kappa 3rd wipe, but I usually lose interest after early wipe, something about fighting with low level gear. Or I;m bad theres always that lol

[2023-01-02 12:06:14] <%Gerberbaby4> @CrazyWizo It's mostly just a knowledge gap bud. Obviously being a god player helps, but none of the quest really require you to be amazing, just some luck
