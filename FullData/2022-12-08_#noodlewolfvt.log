[2022-12-08 20:19:45] <%$Kajiru> I don't know anything about DK tanks, other then I see their health bars bounce around and I'm just like, when do I heal!?
[2022-12-08 20:19:58] <!%admiral_frostbite> They have a ton of self healing and a lot of cd's to manage
[2022-12-08 20:20:09] <!%admiral_frostbite> Also they _have_ to keep up bone shield
[2022-12-08 20:20:11] <@%ThePyenusman> @admiral_frostbite oh initially I was joking me and jerman have a date on his birthday which is December 11th, jerman lives in Georgia

[2022-12-08 23:52:55] <%+Draile_Runescar> yeah swords and blades are amazing to watch being hand forged and you can see the work that goes into a certain type of blade and why smith's charge so much for hand crafted blades

[2022-12-08 23:54:30] <%IneffableShaybean> Have you ever watched a farrier reshoe a horse? It's fascinating

[2022-12-08 23:56:24] <%$huntsman_of_atlas> Cheer100 with concrete and glass both being made of sand. That makes skyscrapers  just really tall sand castles

[2022-12-08 23:57:12] <%$lunarlens> Hello!
[2022-12-08 23:57:31] <dragonblade21315> hopefully we don't use 1500°C oven to build Sandcastles
[2022-12-08 23:57:38] <%IneffableShaybean> Did you know that glass isn't actually completely solid?
[2022-12-08 23:57:42] <%AslanGrants> It's a supercooled liquid, yea.
[2022-12-08 23:57:46] <%IneffableShaybean> oh my gosh we are saying the same thingXD
[2022-12-08 23:57:51] <%$lunarlens> amorphous!  lovely word!
[2022-12-08 23:57:53] <%UselessAF_uwu> so if u think about it... construction workers are actually professional sand castle makers
[2022-12-08 23:58:08] <%IneffableShaybean> glass runs over time and that's why old windows get this warped look

[2022-12-08 23:58:19] <%IneffableShaybean> and they get thicker at the bottom
[2022-12-08 23:58:21] <%IneffableShaybean> just like me
[2022-12-08 23:58:25] <$PowerhouseOfficial> To the person getting into testing, you will get to test for big games if you keep these 3 things in mind: 1. Treat each game like its your last, 2. Give detailed reports and 3. Treat the devs with respect when giving feedback on the games you test.
