[2022-12-21 23:24:16] <%mikehrothgar> @bladehorrify Nah i get it. Ads on this platform are worse than any other platform and it strongly discourages people from watching streamers. Why would anyone pay $5 a month for EVERY streamer they watch? A monthly plan for ad free twitch would be ideal but then streamers wont make money
