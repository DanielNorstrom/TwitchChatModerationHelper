[2023-01-06 18:21:13] <whatwerethinking> @SoloRenektonOnly mundo passive gives ad to mundo, do you steal part of that?
[2023-01-06 18:21:13] <+b0n3sxx> is health a stat
[2023-01-06 18:21:13] <maanred93> you def just killed with ult

[2023-01-06 18:21:42] <@%+Skexxies> it doesn't take 10% of max HP, it reduces max HP by 10%
[2023-01-06 18:21:43] <%Paraschivx> if it steal stats using that stats makes you deal more damage , so it does damage technicaly
[2023-01-06 18:21:48] <Mockingjay40> Huh, I always thought it just took 10% max and multiplied enemy hp by 0.9
[2023-01-06 18:21:55] <@%teamplay4victory> ok if kled dismonts you have 30 seconds
[2023-01-06 18:21:58] <Mockingjay40> Like I thought it just applied a ratio from the steal
[2023-01-06 18:22:02] <@%teamplay4victory> dismounts
[2023-01-06 18:22:07] <%+Diamonddusts> gp has like 1 hp
[2023-01-06 18:22:07] <%onlyzaclol> apparently if you ult kled while skarl is coming, he loses it @SoloRenektonOnly
[2023-01-06 18:22:27] <@%+Skexxies> @Mockingjay40 I think that's correct, but to say "it takes 10% max hp" makes it sound like it does 10% max hp true dmg
[2023-01-06 18:22:41] <@%+Skexxies> which is obvioulsy not ht ecase

[2023-01-06 19:09:49] <droolingmoron13> Thornmail against Illaoi is not even that good. You just avoid hitting the actual target, and focus only the spirit. That way grivious won't apply.
[2023-01-06 19:09:55] <expiredbagofchips> its simple math mike
