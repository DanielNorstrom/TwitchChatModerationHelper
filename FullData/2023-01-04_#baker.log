[2023-01-04 19:25:09] <%scPali> it's just you have lower stagger and destr than swift due to cds
[2023-01-04 19:25:14] <%scPali> same for shields

[2023-01-04 19:26:26] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-04 19:26:33] <%scPali> yes, and you mostly prioritize meter building skills
[2023-01-04 19:27:03] <+pedrorosa1992> reaper good COPIUM
[2023-01-04 19:27:13] <%scPali> it's why with pugs it's a bit sadge since you waste a lot of bubbles on heals anyway
[2023-01-04 19:27:13] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-04 19:27:23] <%scPali> at that point swift is better

[2023-01-04 19:27:53] <+TheJuan> @scPali going for 1400 swift rest spec
[2023-01-04 19:27:59] <%scPali> with swift you can have 100% uptime on guardian tune which makes the whole party basically unkillable
[2023-01-04 19:28:12] <sanokenshi> they need to buff firepower arty
[2023-01-04 19:28:21] <%scPali> just go for the -50% cdr tripod, and shield tripod on guardian
[2023-01-04 19:29:01] <%scPali> should be like 8 sec duration (4 damage reduction/4 shield) and then depending on your gems/swfit you'll have anywhere between 7 to 9 sec cd
[2023-01-04 19:29:26] <@%hoodidupeh> OhShit
[2023-01-04 19:29:31] <%scPali> on my main with 8 gem and 1799 swift it's 7.3 sec cd or smtn

[2023-01-04 20:01:19] <%Kwadrat_> tbh they are not really worth it awa/expert acc are decently chea and class engraving always will be costly
[2023-01-04 20:01:33] <%jackalo34> @Kwadrat_ i was more saying in reference to wat baker said abt hit master bein as usefyul as grudge bc of the 4 hm classes. im sayin all mine are ama so am would be my hm

[2023-01-04 20:01:49] <Munnes> most of the lvl1 class specs use both kbw and grudge
[2023-01-04 20:02:09] <%Kwadrat_> @jackalo34 oh sure yeah for hm its sure comparable
[2023-01-04 20:02:17] <+sarazein81> now I could live dangerously and do tower plus anguished isle on my sorc on the other server, and wait till im chatting with micha and stick them up one by one on the AH cheap and get him to snipe them on our server. just hope no one gets there before him haha

[2023-01-04 20:02:36] <Munnes> I wonder if they are going to try to get rid of lvl1 class meta for some specs in this balance patch
[2023-01-04 20:02:57] <Munnes> Kind of worried about that one
[2023-01-04 20:03:03] <%jackalo34> ye but he can put awak as a 12 on every support n then slot in w.e for second like ppl do for grudge + class or w.e
[2023-01-04 20:03:03] <+sarazein81> ive sold bits between my two servers hehe
[2023-01-04 20:03:22] <%Kwadrat_> for supps tbh i like to have vph/drops as 12

[2023-01-04 20:35:31] <Munnes> @polig well if you look at popularity chart from LOAWA, bottom classes are sharpshooter, deadeye and soulfist iirc
[2023-01-04 20:35:47] <Munnes> so it's not far fetched that those classes should get some love
[2023-01-04 20:35:58] <djjjj> i think blade will get nerfed before striker does

[2023-01-04 20:44:07] <%polig> half of this is training dummy tier list
[2023-01-04 20:44:15] <%+Caedes55> ya idk how it changes in KR
[2023-01-04 20:44:23] <Munnes> it's pretty hard to do well as rage hammer
[2023-01-04 20:44:28] <%ikigami_ikigai> loyal same row with ds Hmm
[2023-01-04 20:44:31] <%Maus3r> empress with 10 gems is cracked
[2023-01-04 20:44:40] <%polig> give me pistol and 10 difficult raids and ill win over rage hammer majority of the time
[2023-01-04 20:44:59] <%polig> oh great its tier list that 95% of people should ignore than xD
[2023-01-04 20:45:08] <%ikigami_ikigai> aggree

[2023-01-04 20:45:27] <%Maus3r> I mean the tierlist is pretty accurate
[2023-01-04 20:45:34] <%polig> it moves enough
[2023-01-04 20:45:34] <%Maus3r> You dont invite zerkers scouters and deadeyes

[2023-01-04 20:46:03] <%Maus3r> but just looking at the bottom, its the same
[2023-01-04 20:46:36] <%ikigami_ikigai> loyal should be a tier lower
[2023-01-04 20:46:44] <Munnes> I'd put AT scouter in A
[2023-01-04 20:46:57] <%+Caedes55> our AT scouter is A tier, but i heard it doesnt scale well at all

[2023-01-04 22:47:15] <Munnes> btw the best part about doing wei frog in g3 is that u dont have to bring timestop

[2023-01-04 23:48:46] <naujokas3> i wanna get my max skill points before i hit 60
[2023-01-04 23:48:57] <%AncientCapitals> To be fair horizontal content makes you no better at raiding. I understand that ppl need metrics to track how good ppl are and they should some arbitrary way to do it that feels good to them.
[2023-01-04 23:49:16] VIEWERS: 593
[2023-01-04 23:50:10] <%+Energylegs> i think thats our own fault
[2023-01-04 23:50:27] <%+Energylegs> i do tons of horizontal content and ppl freak out that im 163 roster level with no vykas xp
[2023-01-04 23:50:34] <%polig> i didnt get my rooster of horizontal xD i got it of 10 chars that i play xD
[2023-01-04 23:51:07] <+klone_iron_fist> You know what made my roster really high? I did both full runs of towers in the first couple of weeks... ON A BARD
[2023-01-04 23:51:08] <naujokas3> so when we doin clown learning party this week?
[2023-01-04 23:51:09] <AncientCapitals> Dont get me wrong i understand the need for any metric to track skill im just saying lost ark has no good metric
[2023-01-04 23:51:12] <%+Niki_xyOn> yeah but i did alomost every raid coming out from beginning with atleast 4 chars too, so it cant be so much rewarding
[2023-01-04 23:51:16] VIEWERS: 111
[2023-01-04 23:51:34] <+klone_iron_fist> tower is huge roster xp
[2023-01-04 23:51:44] <%polig> i had 6 1st month of playing
[2023-01-04 23:51:51] <%polig> and i did tower to lvl them up xD
[2023-01-04 23:51:51] <%givemebeer_> the big one with horizontal is that if you're low roster on certain classes you're either missing either raid xp or the items from horizontal to make your build work
[2023-01-04 23:52:15] <%polig> 4 and prob at least 1 of them of punika pass is nothing sizable
[2023-01-04 23:52:55] <@%ragingqueen666> I saw it NODERS

[2023-01-04 23:53:40] <Falkos___> what do u think better striker or soulfist?
[2023-01-04 23:54:16] <%givemebeer_> depends on budget wideKEKW

[2023-01-04 23:54:40] <+TheJuan> roster level comes a lot from how many characters you are playing
[2023-01-04 23:54:56] <%givemebeer_> good driver actually pumps with soulfist but it takes a lot of skill and fight knowledge
[2023-01-04 23:54:58] <%+Energylegs> you have any vykas/valtan YT guides you really like for learning @Baker?
[2023-01-04 23:55:02] <+TheJuan> and like baker says. if u do all your weekly content
[2023-01-04 23:55:05] <%AncientCapitals> Look i understand the argument, but compared to other games were you have actual metrics to track skill. Lost ark have a way to track correlation at best and not causality.
[2023-01-04 23:55:17] VIEWERS: 577
[2023-01-04 23:55:20] <%givemebeer_> striker wants all of the wealth runes too
[2023-01-04 23:55:43] <%polig> if u take 100 100rooster and 100 200rooster im sure u will see skill difference
[2023-01-04 23:55:48] <%polig> massive skill difference
[2023-01-04 23:56:07] <%AncientCapitals> as said correlation not causality
[2023-01-04 23:56:18] <%givemebeer_> @Energylegs nassem
[2023-01-04 23:56:31] <%polig> can you have 100 rooster who is good? yes. but exceptions doesnt make rules
[2023-01-04 23:56:33] <%givemebeer_> best skill tracker is hell vykas title
[2023-01-04 23:56:43] <%AncientCapitals> which you can buy
[2023-01-04 23:57:06] <%+Caedes55> its so hard cause ive taken 160+ roster only before and they are imposters. then i took a 70 roster w/vykas title and he 1 shot every mech

[2023-01-04 23:59:50] <%+Energylegs> i used up a lot of my early game time trying for the omniums i feel and fell behind on raiding. That and mainswaplyfe.
[2023-01-04 23:59:58] <%+Energylegs> so i getcha
