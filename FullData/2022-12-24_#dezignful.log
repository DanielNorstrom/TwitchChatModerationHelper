[2022-12-24 01:09:43] <85sjones> Cool, I think you can be the best out there. I think apex is dying a little, you feel like this design ?
[2022-12-24 01:10:16] <creakymuch> You guys will be back stronger than ever. You and chaotic with a demon third roller
[2022-12-24 01:10:49] <85sjones> Have they gone too far with abilities for legends?
[2022-12-24 01:10:59] <%thegreaseman0> For all the faults with this game, what is the competition? Warzone is awful. Valorant ?
[2022-12-24 01:11:07] <%+img_hypnotixx> Dez fck to Hear That but u and chaotic u rule this Game again

[2022-12-24 01:17:14] <85sjones> From my perspective Hal is obviously very good at Apex, but I wouldn’t say he is better than you, watching you both in gun fights. Can you tell why Hal does well design? Is it decision making?
