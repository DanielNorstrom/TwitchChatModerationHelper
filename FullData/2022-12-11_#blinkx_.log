[2022-12-11 14:25:30] <%feelingpins> So my friend said if you date a strip - per , you can't be really soft or feminine , you need to be rough like beyond your usual since they're are used to dealing with guys on day to day basis, they don't really feel anything unless it's very aggressive. You have to maintain that level. Therefore strip -pers usually date guys who have dangerous or shady professions

Headphones are heavy and suck so I am going this way also - perhaps starting with 3 budget pairs of:).
