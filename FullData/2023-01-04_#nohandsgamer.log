We're integrating over the curve C, y to the third ds, and C is the curve with parametric equations x = t cubed, y = t. We're going from t = 0 to t = 2.

If you mod me now I will let it go, that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don’t, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will snipe you.

[2023-01-04 06:42:10] <%+ucdchris1> then amulet of undying should cost 3 more each time it upgrades Kappa
[2023-01-04 06:42:16] <hstraxamillion> check out this game, my opponent gets full brann/anubrehkan/astalor combo on 7. I still beat him with priest on 8.
