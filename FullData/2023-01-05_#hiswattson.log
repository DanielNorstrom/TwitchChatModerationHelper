[2023-01-05 16:16:40] <legitwutker74> i have one heirloom and have not spent a dime
[2023-01-05 16:16:43] <ekstaaz_fr> @neezygames did u get it in packs ?
[2023-01-05 16:16:43] <%+neezygames> And next season I get free battle pass because i haven’t spent the free coins I get from leveling :)
[2023-01-05 16:16:46] <josk1y_boi> why would respawn ever make titanfall 3 while apex is this popular
[2023-01-05 16:16:46] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-05 16:16:52] <SuperD427> @xundachicken don’t say that, I still have hope

[2023-01-05 16:17:40] <Hoax415> i think the caring about pros vs caring about casuals dichotomy is fake news. even if EA/Respawn only cared about casuals. IF they were any good at fixing the game the game would be better for pros as well
[2023-01-05 16:17:41] <+ugadawg4lyfe> y'all use apex to make a living and they use y'all to stream and get there game to grow so they can make a living it's a win win

[2023-01-05 16:18:38] <itsChopsticks> respawn is impressive for making us think heirlooms are worth the money lol

[2023-01-05 16:18:52] <+ugadawg4lyfe> if you haven't spent money to get heirloom your not considered casual 😂
[2023-01-05 16:18:58] <+Kingslayer_Wins> beef stock, chicken stock, trading stocks, so many to choose from
[2023-01-05 16:19:01] <Hoax415> legend balance, map quality, audio quality, hackers ruining lobbies, none of those things are specifically casual or pro fixes. all would be huge if they were good and fixed it

[2023-01-05 17:03:26] <ltheshowstopper> I started it again after a 6 months break and I love it tbh
[2023-01-05 17:03:26] <+HYPRsloth> they just keep nerfing crap
[2023-01-05 17:03:27] <spacerocket_> The game feels so much more laggy really
[2023-01-05 17:03:27] <untitledplug123> facts
[2023-01-05 17:03:29] <+Ozzyaya> imnew to the game, hat has changed to make it worse?
[2023-01-05 17:03:30] <ilovedeliworkers> People have gotten too good at the game, it’s like Fortnite, you have to GRIND to continue to stay at your current skill. The game has also gotten worse
[2023-01-05 17:03:31] <+jermainethedon_> Still better than Warzone
[2023-01-05 17:03:33] <SirClen> @MoonBrood_ Skill issue
[2023-01-05 17:03:33] <%cole_train_44> I still think it’s fun and a grind but some stuff does need to be fixed
[2023-01-05 17:03:34] <ziggityzeus> Don’t think it’s gotten worse, I’ve just lost interest.
[2023-01-05 17:03:34] <1KsGg> yes, the playstyle is getting more and more degenerate as time goes on
[2023-01-05 17:03:35] <shqux_> whoever says no obiously is bad at the game
[2023-01-05 17:03:36] <thecreeperchi> No. I like it just as much
[2023-01-05 17:03:36] <%+scurrdogg> The game itself does kinda suck tho lol
[2023-01-05 17:03:38] <+GG_GOLDZ> very drawn out
[2023-01-05 17:03:38] <+jacob91k> hmm not really, tough to say. I don't like a new character every new seaon

[2023-01-05 17:03:39] <wiiiiiiiw7> no
[2023-01-05 17:03:39] <%smitty0078> not worse but repetitive
[2023-01-05 17:03:41] <kieranrluke> Last season was def rough
[2023-01-05 17:03:42] <%$antwan47> it's killing me
[2023-01-05 17:03:42] <+wizzywurtz> scan meta has ruined the entire game
[2023-01-05 17:03:43] <+tylerjenkinz> I'm not a huge fan of the short splits. But otherwise I don't hate the game.
[2023-01-05 17:03:49] <%Hawkeyexx94> No, i just hate the new map
[2023-01-05 17:03:50] <rowdzy> @danglee_ballz snitch
[2023-01-05 17:03:50] <%Nyankowo> the seasons are too long for the little content they have. That's my only complain.
[2023-01-05 17:03:50] <%+aaronlee_b> I liked season 0-2. Didn't play for a few years, and then just started again and I like it again
[2023-01-05 17:03:51] <+sonofaharry> It's not that it has gotten worse, it just has been relatively stale for so long. There are no improvements to continue to inspire growth.
[2023-01-05 17:03:51] <@%$turtleTiff> @slayer_0809 please speak english in chat
[2023-01-05 17:03:53] <spot_rusherz89> I don't play enough to really tell. Nor have I reached high enough to see the worst of this game
[2023-01-05 17:03:54] <%chi3fanton> Fix that and audio
[2023-01-05 17:03:55] <longdongfuey> The highs are just as good, but the lows are worse
[2023-01-05 17:03:59] <aliasjrod> I like it
[2023-01-05 17:03:59] <dm0ney9> no better alternatives
[2023-01-05 17:04:02] <thedannyboyog> i think the matchmaking is killing the game
[2023-01-05 17:04:07] <+Ruttabl> idk why the maps dont rotate for ranked, at least a per-map rank
[2023-01-05 17:04:07] <billpayerna> old system was amazing
[2023-01-05 17:04:08] <ilovedeliworkers> Also there are essentially 0 new players. Because they just get STOMPED by three stacking masters in pubs.
[2023-01-05 17:04:10] <+LobstaClaw69> I just hate the unfair matchmaking
[2023-01-05 17:04:15] <Chidgos> You think you'd still be playing if it wasn't your living? @HisWattson
[2023-01-05 17:04:15] <shqux_> the +200 and -60 system?

[2023-01-05 17:04:16] <%DanGlee_Ballz> @rowdzy damn right, that shit is annoying
[2023-01-05 17:04:16] <+thedoodyman_> How do they change it so it’s less running around killing people
[2023-01-05 17:04:19] <%+caiimekevin_> More fun now that my skill has grown
[2023-01-05 17:04:20] <+Aetheon_> ranked system in general is just boring
[2023-01-05 17:04:21] <scottishking1> so noobs can hit masters etc
[2023-01-05 17:04:24] <+MakeDatCatMeow> Quit crying.

[2023-01-05 17:04:34] <%+tacticbuzz> The running around killing people thing is what has me hard stuck plat. It's hard to get better in ranked when you just get ran the fuck over by players whos skill set is much better

[2023-01-05 17:04:40] <%+aaronlee_b> As a casual, I hate how you get 4-5 kills but if you don't get top like 5 you lose RP
[2023-01-05 17:04:51] <ilovedeliworkers> The game used to be a BR. Now it’s a frag-fuckfest
[2023-01-05 17:04:51] <+AliBeRaged> I dont play every day so i guess it kind of works
[2023-01-05 17:04:51] <Naicii> Yea i stopped playing because I dont want to sweat in ranked but all these top masters and preds are sweating in pubs non stop
[2023-01-05 17:04:56] <+tylerjenkinz> What if it was a 7KP dub?
[2023-01-05 17:05:02] <jounce7> Ridiculous
[2023-01-05 17:05:10] <+nogamertag_x> Feels like respawn is giving up to work on other games
[2023-01-05 17:05:11] <%trotsk1_> Placement meta was better
[2023-01-05 17:05:14] <%neveworley> it’s definitely given me better gameplay in some aspects, but it should change again
[2023-01-05 17:05:15] <jounce7> I'm burnt out from watching ranked honestly
[2023-01-05 17:05:19] <%chi3fanton> Still better than Fortnite
[2023-01-05 17:05:20] <+AliBeRaged> Pubs with sweaty matchmaking
[2023-01-05 17:05:22] <longdongfuey> i don't think the system for RP would be nearly as bad if matchmaking was good
[2023-01-05 17:05:23] <+thedoodyman_> How do they change it?
[2023-01-05 17:05:31] <+GG_GOLDZ> its not fun

[2023-01-05 17:05:38] <sharen_mylode> It’s even worse because pubs aren’t even pubs
[2023-01-05 17:05:38] <ilovedeliworkers> I’ve stopped playing almost entirely. Just watch you cuz you’re entertaining
[2023-01-05 17:05:42] <+AliBeRaged> Still better than Warzone
[2023-01-05 17:05:44] <%chris123456789101010> Think about it!!!!! What made this game this popular was the original rules!!!! Now it’s changed and the game is less popular
[2023-01-05 17:05:46] <spot_rusherz89> @tacticbuzz I know how good I am at this game. Once I get to diamond, I stop.
[2023-01-05 17:05:47] <sharen_mylode> Pubs is just unranked ranked

[2023-01-05 17:06:02] <%+aaronlee_b> I have like 4K lifetime kills, and get matched against people that have 16K on a single character. That gets frustrating
[2023-01-05 17:06:04] <ilovedeliworkers> I’ve been playing destiny2 instead. I don’t get pissed at random teammates
[2023-01-05 17:06:04] <shqux_> if someone can get pred 3 times in  one split there has to be something wrong
[2023-01-05 17:06:07] <+Nyemba> yeah apex is still much better than warzone or fortnite or valorant tbh
[2023-01-05 17:06:13] <+AliBeRaged> Its not better than Overwatch though
[2023-01-05 17:06:19] <Mayuwushii> i have fun with apex, but I'm also really fucking bad so maybe my opinion doesn't count
[2023-01-05 17:06:21] <KIWI427_> It seems like the only time this game is competitive in ranked is on storm point
[2023-01-05 17:06:22] <%chi3fanton> overwatch is ass
[2023-01-05 17:06:30] <%xcorrupt> Just got back into the game in June so its not stale for me yet

[2023-01-05 17:06:39] <kerkerh> WZ more viewers than APex
[2023-01-05 17:06:40] <%+Maxflash100> we've gotten away from winning the game, being the most important thing, causing lower quality games, and far more aping

[2023-01-05 17:06:45] <theoriginalfyzi> your just too good
[2023-01-05 17:06:50] <longdongfuey> They need to fix matchmaking and rethink the beginning of system demotion stuff. It makes the first two weeks of a new season terrible
[2023-01-05 17:06:51] <+jayvalentinotwitch> @tacticbuzz definitely a skill issue theres a reason ur in the rank you are and its no one elses fault lmao
[2023-01-05 17:06:56] <spacerocket_> Y’all kill half the lobby though @hiswattson
[2023-01-05 17:06:58] <%neveworley> i don’t think anyone is enjoying rank, i’m waiting in a diamond queue consisting of 2 people
[2023-01-05 17:07:00] <%chi3fanton> Just started playing last year. Still like apex
[2023-01-05 17:07:03] <%+scurrdogg> Have you ever played with Hal?
[2023-01-05 17:07:11] <spot_rusherz89> @ilovedeliworkers but do you get pissed at shitty servers or full fire teams bulldozing?

[2023-01-05 17:07:18] <ilovedeliworkers> EA is choking the life out of the game. Pushing it to its limits to monetize it.
[2023-01-05 17:07:23] <%wick3dbny> Good morning hiswatWAVE
[2023-01-05 17:07:23] <aliasjrod> it's not pubs for diamond players

[2023-01-05 17:07:37] <mnkmayne> @jayvalentinotwitch you a bit  delusional ya? my solo q is a horrible experience 8 or 9 outta 10. absolute bots in diamond.
[2023-01-05 17:07:38] <jounce7> I agree
[2023-01-05 17:07:41] <%+Gape_Burrito> Buy you get me through the day verySadge
[2023-01-05 17:07:43] <ActuallyKhalid> You’re right , EA cares more about casual players, so they generally cater more to their wants. Apex is fun, but the burnout is real. Sweat is also real asf
[2023-01-05 17:07:43] <wiiiiiiiw7> we need old placement points
[2023-01-05 17:07:44] <%+pete_zapai> don't break my heart like that

[2023-01-05 17:07:49] <jounce7> Its hard to watch, but we like watching you
[2023-01-05 17:07:51] <%+LobstaClaw69> you don't steam tournaments now though
[2023-01-05 17:07:53] <ilovedeliworkers> Would you regularly stream another game?
[2023-01-05 17:07:55] <%+kephssmurf> variety content? :D
[2023-01-05 17:07:55] <raebrith> variety stream!
[2023-01-05 17:07:57] <ActuallyKhalid> If they let respawn do their thing , it’ll be much better
[2023-01-05 17:08:00] <%chi3fanton> Occasionally take breaks from games and you will love it again
[2023-01-05 17:08:03] <inosukehz> good morning chat :3

[2023-01-05 17:08:28] <spot_rusherz89> @ActuallyKhalid true for my fireteam. We get to diamond and then go back to Tarkov
[2023-01-05 17:08:30] <kiTTiponX11> ever considered single player kind of game ?
[2023-01-05 17:08:32] <%neveworley> apex is fun after you’ve had a break
[2023-01-05 17:08:32] VIEWERS: 4 650
[2023-01-05 17:08:33] <jounce7> Why won't EA listen to the pros?
[2023-01-05 17:08:33] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-05 17:08:45] <+AliBeRaged> The trail is kind of lack luster i agree
[2023-01-05 17:08:48] <Trianthania> @neveworley +1000
[2023-01-05 17:08:54] <%Nyankowo> more gamemodes would be so fun
[2023-01-05 17:08:58] <spacerocket_> Custom codes will be dropping though so wont there be more scrims
[2023-01-05 17:08:58] <+AliBeRaged> Needs better rewards
[2023-01-05 17:08:59] <%chris123456789101010> Then don’t get rid of arenas please!!!!!!!!!
[2023-01-05 17:09:08] <+DreDae16> there needs to be more comp tourneys, like weekly
[2023-01-05 17:09:09] <+luisifxr> Do you think there will be more scrims when they release private lobbies for everyone?
[2023-01-05 17:09:09] <ActuallyKhalid> Apex has the best mech & movement
[2023-01-05 17:09:09] <%chi3fanton> solos!!!!
[2023-01-05 17:09:09] <ilovedeliworkers> @jounce7 from their perspective, changing and altering the game to adhere to the top .01% doesn’t make sense as a business
[2023-01-05 17:09:11] <Venser_Stonehorn> Isn't it just up to the pro community to organise scrims? Why not band together with the other guys feeling the same way to set them up
[2023-01-05 17:09:12] <+AliBeRaged> Your job is streaming too :D
[2023-01-05 17:09:13] <ActuallyKhalid> Easily
[2023-01-05 17:09:13] <theoriginalfyzi> how do you feel about the car and scout in the crafter next split
[2023-01-05 17:09:14] <+HYPRsloth> why not an invite only set of servers, and you play for RP and prizes/money at the end of the split and season.
[2023-01-05 17:09:14] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-05 17:09:19] <Chidgos> You think community stuff when custom lobbies launch might make things more tolerable?
[2023-01-05 17:09:24] <alexallstar22> does it get boring
[2023-01-05 17:09:26] <+jacob91k> More scrims with customs?
[2023-01-05 17:09:27] <%chi3fanton> 4 man squads
[2023-01-05 17:09:28] <BonzaiiBomber> i just wanna hit master at least once
[2023-01-05 17:09:29] <+Iconic215> games aren't meant to be played for 6 to 12 hours a day every single day.even people with the most passion in their field have something to complain about.
[2023-01-05 17:09:29] <+teezy219> it is your job tho
[2023-01-05 17:09:30] <+ztub1855> put together some tourneys yourself?
[2023-01-05 17:09:33] <kaz1l1k> Are the other games lot more engaging for pro players, fortnite adn such?
[2023-01-05 17:09:34] <%+scurrdogg> JOB - just over broke
[2023-01-05 17:09:35] <nerfme98> apex cannot have scrims often because you need like 20 teams.. so hard to schedule unlike cs/dota
[2023-01-05 17:09:35] <+teezy219> wanna go flip burgers at mcdonalds?
[2023-01-05 17:09:40] <+GG_GOLDZ> rinse repeat
[2023-01-05 17:09:41] <%+notafanofketchup> do you want to see the circles slowed down again? feels like the new meta is just constantly push, how would you cater to a slower playstyle again, the audio is so loud for pulling you to third parties that with the fast circles you can't have any prolonged engagement without teams showing up left and right
[2023-01-05 17:09:42] <%neveworley> i think having control back will be good, arenas is getting/has been stale hiswatSwag
[2023-01-05 17:09:43] <mnkmayne> @jayvalentinotwitch as i thought clueless your comment to ONE person was general enough to involve all the chat.. YOURANK YOU DESERVE. naw dude I desever higher than the shit teammates I get in rank solo..
[2023-01-05 17:09:46] <dnlegend> Thats my job
[2023-01-05 17:09:47] <ActuallyKhalid> You’re entertaining to watch tho, you switch up your weapon combos
[2023-01-05 17:09:51] <o_Gameboii> easy money
[2023-01-05 17:09:52] <+Nyemba> what do you think about the new lobby mode where you create an entire lobby for the game?
[2023-01-05 17:09:53] <rdowdler> ill trade jobs with you
[2023-01-05 17:09:53] <ActuallyKhalid> Keeps its more entertaining

[2023-01-05 17:10:03] <ilovedeliworkers> That’s because your playing against platinums and golds
[2023-01-05 17:10:04] <%Nyankowo> sounds like a good job catRave
[2023-01-05 17:10:04] <wiiiiiiiw7> its better be hard then easy
[2023-01-05 17:10:08] <+itzbezzie> its not hard to be good at this game lmao.
[2023-01-05 17:10:12] <+itzbezzie> easiest game in the world
[2023-01-05 17:10:12] <+Thehoffyman> At least there is ranked here, Warzone is the same trash over and over again and you just win some and just lose some and then it's over
[2023-01-05 17:10:15] <+AliBeRaged> Sitting in a chair rn as a job
[2023-01-05 17:10:19] <+Coyphish> its not high quality practice in ranked. I hear the same issues with league of legends pros in high ranked queues
[2023-01-05 17:10:19] <%+H20JUICE> you've peaked?
[2023-01-05 17:10:20] <+harryhummus> lol go build houses then
[2023-01-05 17:10:22] <%+scurrdogg> That’s why press should have their own lobby
[2023-01-05 17:10:22] <EfrenMC3> Find a new team that is bronze maybe and then you’ll find the joy of overcoming hard obstacles again? Haha as I’m teammates
[2023-01-05 17:10:23] <+TayLucky> i get worse as i play lol. i pop off when i first get on
[2023-01-05 17:10:24] <Arrythmia> The aversion to add a permanent TDM mode makes it such a pain in the ass to learn good combat habits

[2023-01-05 17:10:37] <+CT_zee> You roll most lobbies so it must get boring after awhile

[2023-01-05 17:10:41] <pomalo> the problem with this game is that ranked games and competitive play are completely different games. You cant actually practice for tpournaments palying rankedđ
[2023-01-05 17:10:42] <+HYPRsloth> go be a plumber then
[2023-01-05 17:10:43] <+AliBeRaged> All the pros should come together and make an FPS game :D

[2023-01-05 17:10:46] <Xking_messx> THEY SHOULD MAKE GB LOBBIES FOR THIS GAME
[2023-01-05 17:10:47] <%Nyankowo> can you get better if you're the best?
[2023-01-05 17:10:47] <@%^Nightbot> No.
[2023-01-05 17:10:47] <blackhole9> i mean no shit? you cant get better at anything if there is not someone thats better than you that you can learn from and try compete against
[2023-01-05 17:10:47] <SirClen> i coach apex, $300 an hour

[2023-01-05 17:11:00] <maybeunfriendme> maybe instead of just ranking why don't you chase records?
[2023-01-05 17:11:00] <+mathletic_ish> existential crisis incoming
[2023-01-05 17:11:06] <BonzaiiBomber> This split*
[2023-01-05 17:11:10] <maybeunfriendme> like kill records and damage records
[2023-01-05 17:11:10] <%+xDan0maNx> hearing a professional streamer complain about playing games all day is like listening to a rich person complain about their money problems
[2023-01-05 17:11:10] <%neveworley> i think taking a break and only doing tournaments would be good, you’d probably enjoy rank after a break from it
[2023-01-05 17:11:10] <baxter4343> Convinced*
[2023-01-05 17:11:10] <+camchiii> U already the best it’s okay Roberto
[2023-01-05 17:11:12] <%Dcobb97> If they had the custom lobbies more scrims would happen
[2023-01-05 17:11:12] <%Proud_Mimic> is cracking your virtual knuckles a virtual nervous habit
[2023-01-05 17:11:13] <%chi3fanton> we love how toxic you can be

[2023-01-05 17:11:34] <+Nyemba> they'll have custom lobbies next drop
[2023-01-05 17:11:36] <+anasrm7> Scrims are more fun for you
[2023-01-05 17:11:36] <%DanGlee_Ballz> 21

[2023-01-05 17:12:05] <%neveworley> people camping with charge rifles honestly just puts me off the game, especially vantage players. ngl ruins my day hiswatSwag
[2023-01-05 17:12:06] <+kingdarwish> Anyone elses g7 just blanks 💀🌚🤣😭
[2023-01-05 17:12:10] <wiiiiiiiw7> omg im gonna cry 😥
[2023-01-05 17:12:15] <tooosauceee> We’ll come work a physical labor job with me for a few months and I garentee you’ll appreciate your boring gaming job lol (no hate)
[2023-01-05 17:12:18] <+HYPRsloth> play with your feet
[2023-01-05 17:12:18] <%randytrashcan3> it sounds like you're bord because you're not playing people your skill level
[2023-01-05 17:12:22] <+Ichigeki1> @vidaminz im guessing your job isnt watching twitch, keep it down you gibbon
[2023-01-05 17:12:26] <maybeunfriendme> well theres also the a point where you can't just get better because you've reached the threshold thats why people play multiple games maybe try to go pro in super people or something more diffcult?

[2023-01-05 17:12:34] <mnkmayne> I usded to play console COD 10+ years ago.. same thing he complains about now. dead boring lobbies.
[2023-01-05 17:12:38] <ilovedeliworkers> Yeah I mean, apex is your main game streaming. I’d recommend playing something else for a bit. Give yourself a 2-3 week break on it.
[2023-01-05 17:12:41] <+itzbezzie> get a real job bro
[2023-01-05 17:12:43] <special_dylivery> you ever play controller?
[2023-01-05 17:12:52] <waxnoxx> you just misted a purple back
[2023-01-05 17:12:55] <BigDanT_> have you ever had a "regular" job?
[2023-01-05 17:13:01] <%runewillie1> Then you’ll never be on
[2023-01-05 17:13:02] <%neveworley> would that be permanent or just a break?
[2023-01-05 17:13:06] <%DanGlee_Ballz> so we wouldnt have our daily @HisWattson stream?
[2023-01-05 17:13:11] <+AliBeRaged> @itzbezzie Whats a real job lmaoooo thought just had to make money
[2023-01-05 17:13:12] <aliasjrod> no
[2023-01-05 17:13:12] <%+katana_gb> Id love to see furia cam in more scrims for sure
[2023-01-05 17:13:13] <%WhiteRen> the pandxrz strat
[2023-01-05 17:13:16] <tmg_fade> so less streaming or different games on stream??
[2023-01-05 17:13:20] <dnlegend> You would lose tons of income tho?
[2023-01-05 17:13:21] <%+wynodyno> What about your loyal following ??? What do we do at work all day if you leave??
[2023-01-05 17:13:23] <!+kosmogenesis> lol all these normies in chat just dont get it
[2023-01-05 17:13:28] <scarlettmoonz> go for it sometimes changing things up will help
[2023-01-05 17:13:30] <jieseldeans> Watson’s tired if being at the top
[2023-01-05 17:13:32] <frizzlefresh> got a book reco for you Wattson. Designing Your Life
[2023-01-05 17:13:34] <Mayuwushii> @HisWattson your feelings are valid king, follow your heart on matters that affect your livelyhood
[2023-01-05 17:13:38] <+scarslaps> i like watchign ranked but i would also enjoy furia tourney pov
[2023-01-05 17:13:42] <jieseldeans> He needs someone to take his place
[2023-01-05 17:13:44] <ilovedeliworkers> Not streaming daily will unfortunately hurt your channel. You should start streaming other games and then apex tourneys.
[2023-01-05 17:13:54] <ann39> my routine of watching wattson everyday at breakfast StinkyCheese
[2023-01-05 17:13:59] <+Tornjak> Wish pro/amateur teams did more small tourney or streamed scrims. I really enjoy watching pro teams play
[2023-01-05 17:14:04] <spacecowboy69869> don't force me to be focus at work in the AM. That's just rude
[2023-01-05 17:14:12] <%neveworley> would not playing rank be permanent?
[2023-01-05 17:14:17] <%DanGlee_Ballz> maybe make it fun by doing challs and such @HisWattson
[2023-01-05 17:14:20] <wiiiiiiiw7> but you need practice and  playing tô much to be good at tourements
[2023-01-05 17:14:20] <%runewillie1> Now with private matches being open. You can run scrims all the time tho.
[2023-01-05 17:14:34] <bethdunsmoor> you got to do what makes you feel fulfilled and happy

[2023-01-05 17:14:44] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-05 17:14:46] <+GG_GOLDZ> I guess when you have 3 accounts in pred its just rinse repeat KEKW
[2023-01-05 17:14:46] <+anasrm7> Why not use rank to explain the game since it got easier
[2023-01-05 17:14:47] <wbtrip33> That’s what happens when you get to the top.  No where else to go
[2023-01-05 17:14:49] <+Naderhader> Yeah I feel like now it’s just ape everything
[2023-01-05 17:14:56] <heiligesnoah1309> hey =)
[2023-01-05 17:14:58] <spacerocket_> Old ranked was ratty as shit @hiswattson
[2023-01-05 17:14:59] <%chi3fanton> #1 is so far ahead
[2023-01-05 17:15:06] <+svnnybvnny> I mean when masters and pred lobbys become this type of level of easy its becomes a chore instead of a game
[2023-01-05 17:15:08] <+AliBeRaged> Name another challenging FPS though . This is the most strategy FPS game
[2023-01-05 17:15:08] <ilovedeliworkers> Play another game my man.
[2023-01-05 17:15:10] <%+connor30fps> scrims
[2023-01-05 17:15:11] <+TayLucky> @HisWattson something to think about that might make you feel a little better about it would be just to know that a lot of people probably learn a lot just from watching you stream (myself included) so it's nice to see consistent gameplay because it's entertaining and helps some people
[2023-01-05 17:15:11] <+AliBeRaged> rn
[2023-01-05 17:15:16] <%electrichandz> I feel like we grow and change alittle evereyday. Listen toyour mind and do what feelsright for your mental wattos!

[2023-01-05 17:15:20] <LeoSypniewski> I’m sure when you’re at the level you guys are at it just feels like pubs unless you find a pro team
[2023-01-05 17:15:24] <@%BESTGlRL> its cause i dont queue ranked when u do
[2023-01-05 17:15:24] <BombaGotGas> ur number 4?

[2023-01-05 17:15:34] <thedannyboyog> go for #1 in arenas
[2023-01-05 17:15:35] <thagromz> Play more at night
[2023-01-05 17:15:36] <%Proud_Mimic> and soon anyone can make custom lobbies so i think scrims will be more common

[2023-01-05 17:16:18] <Venser_Stonehorn> Why don't you play with other twitch streamers in your stack who aren't also pros
[2023-01-05 17:16:18] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-05 17:16:19] <ActuallyKhalid> If you played later in the evening ?? Players would be better ?
[2023-01-05 17:16:20] <+anasrm7> EU serves are better I feel
[2023-01-05 17:16:22] <TraeMundo> @HisWattson do you think the amount of pro/high skill tourneys will increase now that they are adding private lobbies?
[2023-01-05 17:16:23] <@%thecrookthatcancook> give me the shirt off your back BillyApprove
[2023-01-05 17:16:26] <%ChOoSeMyNaMe> well Blizzard reoriented OW 1 towards casuals and it resulted in the downfall of their competitive

[2023-01-05 17:17:08] <%neveworley> it doesn’t sound stupid, lulu switched to other games rather than just apex and got trolled for it, so hopefully that wouldn’t be the case for you

[2023-01-05 17:17:12] <o_Gameboii> yea they just added cross play but I started playing apex because I hit diamond and got bored @aliberaged

[2023-01-05 17:32:56] <%+KlutZ_20> Apex isnt what its used to be. What was once fun to play, is now the most annoying FPS game. Nothing but 3rd parties, being shot in the back, and teammates that have no idea how to play

[2023-01-05 17:45:10] <beefiebison> I’m not hating on gaming but lack of seeing people irl is brutal. We weren’t made to do so. Because “your just existing” at that point

[2023-01-05 17:45:14] <@%BESTGlRL> also true
[2023-01-05 17:45:17] <yungsweeetjones> This is false advertising if he is not playing Watson

[2023-01-05 18:13:24] <zuckssmokedmeat> Brick and Mortar retailers have overhead that makes them uncompetitive with online retail. Cost of in person employees, shipping to the store, the cost of having to pay rent on the store front etc. It’s just a dying business model.

[2023-01-05 20:00:39] <+FOXposure> The reason I think we all like Apex is because of loot crates and humans really like surprises, and being let down.... but every once in a while we get a hint of hope that you actually are loved. When you find a purple armor in a loot crate for example. Another example is the wingman. You miss every shot and just know you suck, but then when you land 2 shots, you feel like a god. Okay that's my thought of the day.

[2023-01-05 20:47:41] <SLOTHYDONKS> the problem with basing an entire business model off of MTX revenues is MTX revenues are not insured and one day moms credit card could get 500 swipes and another day moms credit card gets 0 swipes and thats just not profitable in any way shape or form. WTF u thinkin EA is doing not paying ALGS announcers....they literally arent profitable

You're basing such an affirmation based on conditions what will never evolve, when they will of course - new items to monetize, new types of Battle Pass, side-projects in the franchise... EA is certainly not done making huge amounts of money from Apex

[2023-01-05 20:53:00] <SLOTHYDONKS> @Chauthe its not necessarily the mtx that are the issue....,. its mtx plus being a very surface level BR game. Like....viewership/player base is in decline bc of lackluster updates and content right? Its due to the fact that instead of producing better content the developers are focused mainly on mtx additions, new skins, etc because thats what makes the money....not a new free quality of life update of the game that everyone could benefit from which would rebound viewership and player base

[2023-01-05 20:56:06] <+Chauthe> @SLOTHYDONKS I disagree and this is a totally different type of game, you could say WoW is dead arguably. I think people in masses would refuse to play apex if you tied a subscription plan to it.

[2023-01-05 20:58:06] <SLOTHYDONKS> @Chauthe look my dude, if you had a lemonade stand, and 10 people signed up for a weekly cup of lemonade. Lets say you charge a dollar per drink...$10 per week 100% of the time. Do you take that ensured $10 every time, OR instead base the lemonade stand off the traditional concept....someone shows up, they buy a drink, you get paid $1. If you were to budget for a whole year under both systems, which budget do you think would project a reasonably true profit/outcome

[2023-01-05 21:13:41] <+snowbaebae> @alucard8732 true. respawn is like a 30 person operation though. EA could invest to build it and they don't. maybe this game or respawn doesn't bring a lot of value. we should just all be proud that we care enough to argue about a game that won't be relevant in 5 years

His virtuosity in shooters is equivalent to only the greatest masters like Bethoven or Mozart but unlike music, he creates a chaos composition among his enemys

[2023-01-05 22:12:44] <thewildcongar> Fun Fact! Velociraptors were actually feathered animals. They grew up to 100 pounds, about the size of a wolf. And they likely hunted solo—using their claws to clutch rather than slash prey—when they roamed central and eastern Asia between about 74 million and 70 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period.
