[2022-12-29 01:53:32] <+psykoskream> shield was the first weapon that got me through my first clear
[2022-12-29 01:53:38] <birbsmas_> No

[2022-12-29 01:53:54] <+MackOfHearts> So with the shield, when you charge up your bull rush attack, you're immune to damage from the front
[2022-12-29 01:54:17] <+Renlio> there would be a chance that the next room after chaos might have a heart

[2022-12-29 01:55:06] <+psykoskream> for all your dashes have done for me
[2022-12-29 01:55:37] <+jamjoni> Are you just recently getting into hades?
[2022-12-29 01:55:38] <+psykoskream> the attack can deflect now
[2022-12-29 01:55:52] <UltimaPowers> deflect builds are the best
[2022-12-29 01:55:57] <+ChrisPrimeX1> you already double strike, so divine strike synergizes well
[2022-12-29 01:56:15] <%+DarkMambaZero> Her call is good though
[2022-12-29 01:56:20] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> never go wrong with more dps
[2022-12-29 01:56:22] <+jamjoni> you get rewards for doing the ones with exclamation points as well. but the first one is prob the best
[2022-12-29 01:56:29] <+ChrisPrimeX1> true
[2022-12-29 01:56:31] <+psykoskream> its all good options

[2022-12-29 01:57:11] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> nobody likes zues
[2022-12-29 01:57:16] <%PonyMontana> fav weapon so far ?
[2022-12-29 01:57:17] <+ChrisPrimeX1> yeah, all good choices honestly
[2022-12-29 01:57:30] <+ChrisPrimeX1> that's the best thing about this game - so many great ways to play that feel so good
[2022-12-29 01:57:33] <%+scooby_shaggy> do they have cerberus stuff?
[2022-12-29 01:57:34] <+psykoskream> 500
[2022-12-29 01:57:34] <%+DarkMambaZero> i dont mind Zeus lol but he isn't my fave tho
[2022-12-29 01:57:43] <%Pogarithmic> bawkHyper
[2022-12-29 01:57:57] <+psykoskream> poseidon is my fave
[2022-12-29 01:58:16] <zehdre> Zeus attack would actually not be bad here.
[2022-12-29 01:58:26] <%+DarkMambaZero> Detemer, Aphrodite, and Hermes the goats
[2022-12-29 01:58:30] <%PonyMontana> i wish artemis would shoot me

[2022-12-29 01:59:54] <%Pogarithmic> Zeus slaps on fast-paced weapons and stacking a lot of Zeus. Otherwise his boons are underwhelming

[2022-12-29 02:00:14] <+Astralshockwave> 2 can be good
[2022-12-29 02:00:23] <+psykoskream> you will take damage lol
[2022-12-29 02:00:27] <+Astralshockwave> 3 is also fair
[2022-12-29 02:00:30] <digaogrunge> 2 is good, but just do the fated stuff
[2022-12-29 02:00:33] <%keeran8894> i've heard zeus stuff can be good, but needs a LOT f commitment to get only stuff form him

[2022-12-29 02:01:05] <crooklynz> dont you already have a dash this run
[2022-12-29 02:01:15] <UltimaPowers> 2 by far
[2022-12-29 02:01:26] <bigl1ps> 1 good
[2022-12-29 02:01:31] <Marshmallum> zeus on shield special can be decent
[2022-12-29 02:01:39] <digaogrunge> do your thing, you will dodge and you will get hit
[2022-12-29 02:01:44] <crooklynz> oh oops ya youre right
[2022-12-29 02:01:46] <%+DarkMambaZero> 2 is good

[2022-12-29 02:01:51] <+TheKhaosTheori> zeus boons are good for punishing enemies
[2022-12-29 02:01:57] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> I'd say 3 just for progress

[2022-12-29 02:02:10] <%Pogarithmic> I know what I'd pick, but this decision won't make or break your run. Go with your gut
[2022-12-29 02:02:10] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> any choice has its benefits
[2022-12-29 02:02:12] <+TheKhaosTheori> 2 is great
[2022-12-29 02:02:15] <Ailor> It's not a big deal really
[2022-12-29 02:02:19] <%OptPlaysGames> 1 is good for stacking jolt later
[2022-12-29 02:02:21] <+ChrisPrimeX1> Don't worry too much, bro. You never know what will come up later that can make something underwhelming become cracked.
[2022-12-29 02:02:28] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> pretty sure otz has a schedule on his twitch page

[2022-12-29 02:13:46] <%+DarkMambaZero> Ares for sure

[2022-12-29 02:13:49] <Alextreides> mmmm
[2022-12-29 02:13:50] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> ares
[2022-12-29 02:13:51] <+RagMuffin> poseidon could be dope if you push up against wall
[2022-12-29 02:13:52] <+SmurfinTurtle> Ares
[2022-12-29 02:13:54] <zehdre> Hm. Ares could be really good with a couple boons actually.
[2022-12-29 02:13:55] <%Kaine_san> poseidon chads
[2022-12-29 02:13:55] <%Pogarithmic> Not Poseidon on shield
[2022-12-29 02:13:56] <%Syoxin> poseidon
[2022-12-29 02:13:59] <%+N7_Indra> Ares is better for shield imo
[2022-12-29 02:14:00] <tannu_tuva> Ares
[2022-12-29 02:14:00] <%OptPlaysGames> poseidon is s-tier
[2022-12-29 02:14:01] <digaogrunge> Poseidon will push dudes away, go with Ares
[2022-12-29 02:14:02] <Alextreides> poseidon I think is to move enemies
[2022-12-29 02:14:04] <Laurcus> Poseidon scales better.
[2022-12-29 02:14:11] <SuburbanSocrates> Poseidon's attack knocks back. This can be a good or a bad thing.
[2022-12-29 02:14:13] <+MackOfHearts> Ares is my favorite, but knockeback from PoPo can come in clutch on the shield
[2022-12-29 02:14:17] <%+scooby_shaggy> put a poll up
[2022-12-29 02:14:17] <Marshmallum> ares is pretty nice on shield throw
[2022-12-29 02:14:18] <%+N7_Indra> Poseidon is better with weapons that have some range
[2022-12-29 02:14:21] <Aruvella> Knock back is great with the shield.
[2022-12-29 02:14:23] <+psykoskream> huge damage buff with poseidon
[2022-12-29 02:14:24] <+RagMuffin> Poseidon really hits very hard; espec if you grind against wall
[2022-12-29 02:14:25] <%Pogarithmic> Poseidon is very generally solid, but bad with shield
[2022-12-29 02:14:27] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> Poseidon is situational otherwise pretty bad

[2022-12-29 02:14:38] <SuburbanSocrates> Ares applies the Doom status effect. It's a burst of damage on a time delay.
[2022-12-29 02:14:40] <%+N7_Indra> Flip a coin then

[2022-12-29 02:17:13] <%+N7_Indra> Take 2
[2022-12-29 02:17:13] <BrOOnoh> doom is great
[2022-12-29 02:17:18] <digaogrunge> Kinda
[2022-12-29 02:17:18] <+RagMuffin> like, it makes a little thing over their head and it takes a while to do the damage
[2022-12-29 02:17:20] <%$Illuna_Meira> they're doom haters
[2022-12-29 02:17:23] <NoahieO2> Do special for sure

[2022-12-29 02:17:27] <%Syoxin> better on special
[2022-12-29 02:17:28] <zehdre> Kinda...
[2022-12-29 02:17:29] <Rokynn> you need aduo boon to make doom stack
[2022-12-29 02:17:29] <%Pogarithmic> Special is good with doom tbh
[2022-12-29 02:17:31] <digaogrunge> You need a new boon to make it stack
[2022-12-29 02:17:31] <%EfraLegend> you can get a boon that makes it stack
[2022-12-29 02:17:34] <%+N7_Indra> Take 2 then get next attack boon
[2022-12-29 02:17:41] <Auro_Boros> Meh, I prefer DOOM II tbh
[2022-12-29 02:17:43] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> wtf I swear it does stack but I haven't played in a while
[2022-12-29 02:17:44] <+psykoskream> quick shield throw
[2022-12-29 02:17:44] <+RagMuffin> Shield bounce + doom pretty good though
[2022-12-29 02:17:46] <tannu_tuva> Doom is still good on some weapons, like ranged
[2022-12-29 02:17:46] <thesacredwalrus> You can proc doom as much as you want, just not two at a time on one enemy
[2022-12-29 02:17:47] <Laurcus> Doom is only truly good when combined with a certain other boon that you probably won't see for awhile.
[2022-12-29 02:17:51] <SuburbanSocrates> There is another Ares boon that upgrades the doom so that it can stack. @Oroboro
[2022-12-29 02:17:51] <+RagMuffin> doom on every target it bounces
[2022-12-29 02:17:55] <%OptPlaysGames> @auro_boros I‚Äôm more of a DOOM 2016 guy myself
[2022-12-29 02:17:56] <Aruvella> If you get the attack, you'll be able to get a Heroic attack off another boon later.
[2022-12-29 02:18:10] <%Pogarithmic> RNGesus Prayge
[2022-12-29 02:18:16] <%+N7_Indra> You're still getting more damage output here though
[2022-12-29 02:18:16] <Laurcus> That's what I meant when Is aid Poseidon scales better. Things like double hit and attack speed juice don't benefit Doom.
[2022-12-29 02:18:18] <%+N7_Indra> It will help
[2022-12-29 02:18:21] <thesacredwalrus> Spamming range is amazing with this weapon because of doom

[2022-12-29 02:24:55] <Laurcus> Doom is good for things that do low damage and are easy to hit with like special. For basic attack you want things that give a percent bonus to dmg, like Poseidon, Athena, Artemis, etc.

[2022-12-29 04:24:05] <+RuDeMaTaDoR> Hit those urns for $$$
[2022-12-29 04:24:05] <+7stringarmy> he said this was the run, and it was 666. It's gonna happen
[2022-12-29 04:24:08] <multibacking> uh oh

[2022-12-29 04:24:13] <%$tmpest_> but random
[2022-12-29 04:24:14] <%SleepySlee> YUP but they are random
[2022-12-29 04:24:15] <multibacking> the anvil is a risky item
[2022-12-29 04:24:16] <Luanciel> but random upgrades thou
[2022-12-29 04:24:16] <%OptPlaysGames> the anvil is hot ass
[2022-12-29 04:24:16] <+7stringarmy> its random

[2022-12-29 04:24:19] <+PoliteHavoc> not worth with your build
[2022-12-29 04:24:19] <+jPhamPham> random
[2022-12-29 04:24:19] <SuburbanSocrates> No money tho.

[2022-12-29 04:24:20] <digaogrunge> bur random
[2022-12-29 04:24:24] <%hokmon_> anvil can be pretty risky since it's random
[2022-12-29 04:24:25] <%SteveSketches> It's risky.  Could take your range or your dash.
[2022-12-29 04:24:25] <blyordie2> u dont need it
[2022-12-29 04:24:26] <powerless_imp0> it's random tho
[2022-12-29 04:24:26] <Gatol3> it's random tho
[2022-12-29 04:24:28] <longship_loft> anvil is like randomising your build
[2022-12-29 04:24:31] <+7stringarmy> i did it once and regretted lol
[2022-12-29 04:24:32] <Malphas2121> @Coal_Dust3 Thanks
[2022-12-29 04:24:35] <%+DarkMambaZero> its random... could def screw up the build
[2022-12-29 04:24:42] <@%Peeve> it's random. Could make or break a run
[2022-12-29 04:24:45] <JTWhisper> furthest I've seen so far is reaching hades
[2022-12-29 04:24:46] <%SteveSketches> I've had Anvil work very, very well.... once.
[2022-12-29 04:25:00] <+The_NightShader> My brother quit hades because of elysium, i told him to stick with it but he don't want to.
[2022-12-29 04:25:02] <Beanhead_Lookinass> Is this the farthest Oro has made it?
[2022-12-29 04:25:12] <Coal_Dust3> Had it work very well for me, and against me.
[2022-12-29 04:25:13] <JTWhisper> Oro reached Hades once that I saw
[2022-12-29 04:25:16] <+PoliteHavoc> oro got two good hammers so best to stick

[2022-12-29 04:26:03] <%SteveSketches> TBF Elysium shield boys almost made me quit too.
[2022-12-29 04:26:23] <+The_NightShader> @The_NightShader i told him it that. but after 2 deaths in elysium he's won't play it  lol

[2022-12-29 04:26:45] <%SteveSketches> I died many, many times before I beat the gankers.
[2022-12-29 04:26:47] <blyordie2> damn, is it only for me hades and hades(boss) was very easy?
[2022-12-29 04:26:49] <+jPhamPham> those rats are thicc

[2022-12-29 04:28:23] <tannu_tuva> rats are my least fav enemy in the game lol
[2022-12-29 04:28:36] <MarcusHash> @blyordie2 Go higher. There is a certain option that affects bosses when you choose your heat level
[2022-12-29 04:28:38] <Coal_Dust3> I find them satisfying to crush.

[2022-12-29 05:41:26] <%AbyssCuda> more dps?
[2022-12-29 05:41:30] <+RaziWraith> only 30% reduction you still can't afford that imo
[2022-12-29 05:41:31] <%+Sheepisan> it is good to shred armor when youre using fists

[2022-12-29 05:41:36] <jeananemo> 2
[2022-12-29 05:41:42] <Aruvella> You need range because of those chariot enemies.
[2022-12-29 05:41:45] <%+Dazitup> 1 all the way to deal with armoured foes

[2022-12-29 05:57:28] <zxthed> 2 is super free
[2022-12-29 05:57:29] <%+doctorwolfman> 2 kills Zeus DONT
[2022-12-29 05:57:29] <lordkaathe> this is hard choice

[2022-12-29 05:57:39] <!%xperimentalsubject> Cluster means you have to use the Special Kappa

[2022-12-29 05:57:41] <engagephysically> Cluster bomb is the best hammer upgrade
[2022-12-29 05:57:44] <%mythmakroxymore> 1 is incredible if you get another certain hammer
[2022-12-29 05:57:48] <engagephysically> For this weapon its the best upgrade

[2022-12-29 06:55:22] <+P0KEMONER> Is it rouge like? Or linear ?
[2022-12-29 06:55:42] <claricorp> rogue like

[2022-12-29 06:55:49] <+MonsieurHorse> @P0KEMONER Rogue like. But it has linear progression. Which is why it's good.

[2022-12-29 07:37:19] <+TheAssumingMage> You can die once in each room
[2022-12-29 07:37:22] <Lightpwnr> that means at low hp you intentionally die to get more hp
[2022-12-29 07:37:27] <%keeran8894> you only really die at bosses, at you might die more than once on those so...
[2022-12-29 07:37:27] <%GoddamnWizard> Stubborn is good when learning the game, but strictly inferior if you're consistently making it to the final boss with at least 1 defiance
[2022-12-29 07:37:28] <dthmagnet> death defiance better as the boss encounters are most likely to pop you
[2022-12-29 07:37:28] <+TheAssumingMage> Both are equally viable
[2022-12-29 07:37:29] <%Pogarithmic> Stubborn is the move for high heat NODDERS
[2022-12-29 07:37:30] <%SleepySlee> but stubborn is better on certain weapons
[2022-12-29 07:37:31] <%$tmpest_> can't bank them for bosses though
[2022-12-29 07:37:31] <%+N7_Indra> You can technically die in every room, but only once on bosses. Take your pick
[2022-12-29 07:37:39] <%Pogarithmic> Because you will die
[2022-12-29 07:37:47] <grandeval_behoof> I never run Stubborn bc I suck at dad fight
[2022-12-29 07:37:52] <%SleepySlee> Just get good at the bosses KEKW they are the most consistent part of the game
[2022-12-29 07:37:56] <%Cody_Ross> This is such a wonderful game.
[2022-12-29 07:37:56] <%+N7_Indra> ^
[2022-12-29 07:38:04] <%Cody_Ross> oops sorry N7_Indra
[2022-12-29 07:38:06] <nola_epeeist> @GoddamnWizard regen loses out because of all the rooms in Styx where those 3hp add up. Regen can help get to styx though.
[2022-12-29 07:38:16] <+TheAssumingMage> one
[2022-12-29 07:38:16] <%+N7_Indra> @Cody_Ross I still agree with that KEKW
[2022-12-29 07:38:17] <nola_epeeist> just 1
[2022-12-29 07:38:17] <%Pogarithmic> Just one
[2022-12-29 07:38:18] <%SteveSketches> One at a time.
[2022-12-29 07:38:18] <!%Sir__Nova> Just the 1
[2022-12-29 07:38:21] <Luanciel> 1 per line
[2022-12-29 07:38:25] <longship_loft> plus the tooth

[2022-12-29 07:38:43] <%SleepySlee> I can never go back to one dash
[2022-12-29 07:38:44] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> green dash is broken on a certain weapon
[2022-12-29 07:38:48] <+EldritchPreacher> Think you have the timing mr parry king?
[2022-12-29 07:38:48] <MisterBing13> You know it's a hard choice when you read the other option and say "Aw fuck"
[2022-12-29 07:38:54] <+TheAssumingMage> lol I use ruthless and forgot it gives dodge
[2022-12-29 07:39:02] <powerless_imp0> that sounds like something you'd want when using a weapon that has high, single hit damage
[2022-12-29 07:39:04] <%GoddamnWizard> @nola_epeeist How many rooms are there on a floor though? You can get more healing from a single darkness if it's not a bountry run
[2022-12-29 07:39:05] <%Cody_Ross> Double Dash is so nice
[2022-12-29 07:39:09] <+gaucho_650> Always double dash, movement is life in this game
[2022-12-29 07:39:13] <nola_epeeist> but try out stubborn if you want. It's just a key if you don't like it.
[2022-12-29 07:39:26] <%Pogarithmic> ^
[2022-12-29 07:39:51] <%Pogarithmic> trying shit out is the way to go with this game. Highly subjective experience
[2022-12-29 07:39:56] <%Cody_Ross> Im surprised it took you this long to really get into Hades
[2022-12-29 07:40:22] <%SleepySlee> @nola_epeeist No shot, Dark regen is always better, you run into darkness in a ton of different places and even in Styx 1-2 Darkness pickups is more HP than all of the rooms put together
[2022-12-29 07:40:29] VIEWERS: 652
[2022-12-29 07:40:39] <!%KayleNikita> styg soul is amazing
[2022-12-29 07:40:44] <+jPhamPham> did u decide to play because hades 2 is coming out?
[2022-12-29 07:40:45] <MisterBing13> For your spear/bow cast builds
[2022-12-29 07:40:54] <nola_epeeist> @GoddamnWizard ello isn't online rn, but he's one of the leading modders and has run the numbers. Average darkness per run is less than 3hp per chamber. So IDK what to tell you. Regen helps early game, falls off late.
[2022-12-29 07:40:57] <Hooded_Lay> Ruthless + Hermes' extra dash is very fun
[2022-12-29 07:41:06] <%SlamDunkinson> stygian is better for trippy shot bc the cooldown goes while festive fog is active
[2022-12-29 07:41:12] <ZelaznyWilk> 3 cast it's way better for cast builds imho
[2022-12-29 07:41:12] <+kyokushin667> I'd do that one tbh I'm a hoarder
[2022-12-29 07:41:15] <Lightpwnr> deep pockets imo
[2022-12-29 07:41:18] <It_Is_A_Moose> So either starting gold or interest.
[2022-12-29 07:41:24] <+jPhamPham> hoarde and skip all the shop rooms is what I do LUL
[2022-12-29 07:41:27] <Lightpwnr> starting gold can snowball too esay
[2022-12-29 07:41:34] <MisterBing13> Get that 20 key unlock ASAP, it's hiding something killer
[2022-12-29 07:41:35] <%SlamDunkinson> a lot of these are build specific
[2022-12-29 07:41:35] <nola_epeeist> pockets better for beating run, other one good for farming meta currency at end shop
[2022-12-29 07:41:37] <dthmagnet> deep is de wey
[2022-12-29 07:41:42] <%SleepySlee> Golden Touch is best when you start with the money bag
[2022-12-29 07:41:48] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> you basically skip all the beginning shops to horde for the later ones
[2022-12-29 07:41:55] <Lightpwnr> you do the hoard one after multiple clears
[2022-12-29 07:41:56] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> hoard rather
[2022-12-29 07:41:59] <%keeran8894> basically when you defeat a boss, you get a % of the gold you're currentl;y holding. Not worth IMO
[2022-12-29 07:42:10] <%Cody_Ross> I really need to gift you Brotato one of these days Brandon. I think youd like it as a game in short spurts
[2022-12-29 07:42:17] <It_Is_A_Moose> Oooh.

[2022-12-29 07:42:40] <Lightpwnr> more hp; too easy to be below 80%

[2022-12-29 07:42:56] <+gaucho_650> High confidence is great for speedruns, thick skin is safer

[2022-12-29 07:45:17] <powerless_imp0> have you taken a look at the specials on the spear
[2022-12-29 07:45:18] <+jPhamPham> I've never done a case build LUL

[2022-12-29 07:45:42] <powerless_imp0> sword + artemis with the crit is Kreygasm
[2022-12-29 07:45:48] <%SlamDunkinson> little tip for sword: the 3 hit combo is kinda slow. so using special into dash attacks tends to be better dps imo
[2022-12-29 07:45:49] <bready4twitch> saving for hades 2
