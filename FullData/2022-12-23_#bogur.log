[2022-12-23 20:25:45] <jollyradtime> Idk but I am a plat sitting in lobbies with Masters and people with the GM Challenger Titles. And I am roughly 50/50 in those lobbies.
[2022-12-23 20:25:55] <jollyradtime> So I want to know what their MMR is and what mine is
[2022-12-23 20:26:07] <a_jom1> it'd be cool if atleast knew our skill tier division after every game
[2022-12-23 20:26:22] <%abbzug> that's so odd do you play support @jollyradtime ?

[2022-12-23 20:28:33] <%abbzug> we got the playercards!!!! Kapp
[2022-12-23 20:28:52] <+oskilos> they even removed borders..
[2022-12-23 20:29:39] <a_jom1> it's frustrating that I am silver currently because of the reset but the games aren't easier even tho I'm a lower rank, and it's so fucking depressing tbh
[2022-12-23 20:29:50] <jollyradtime> @jollyradtime Yeah I have had a few GM Challengers. They aren't super common or anything but they have happened a few times. Masters players are surprisingly common. Diamonds are everywhere.
[2022-12-23 20:30:24] <jollyradtime> But I am also high plat so maybe that is part of it? But I think they said that they only matchmake on MMR not on SR

[2022-12-23 21:19:40] <%Gibson5000> I played 8 games last night, 4 were push boggPain and two were Oasis. Only got two payload maps.
[2022-12-23 21:19:48] <Roguko> even that doesnt make sense
[2022-12-23 21:19:53] <Roguko> because you add more and more adds

[2022-12-23 21:20:24] <%Digichanted> they literally had a tile in the arcade that was a single map in season 1 ow2
[2022-12-23 21:20:25] <%Gibson5000> @lindskitten And one of the payload maps was Paraiso, which I personally can't stand.
[2022-12-23 21:20:27] <loypower> yeah they are putting a lot of resources into new players and abandoning the actual long term player pool
[2022-12-23 21:20:30] <Roguko> what if you were able to queue for maps?

[2022-12-23 21:21:02] <loypower> 2cp in 5v5 could 100% work
[2022-12-23 21:21:03] <Roguko> I swear
[2022-12-23 21:21:08] <iPRIxMAi> 2cp would be fine in 5v5

[2022-12-23 21:21:29] <%Coyly> yeah definitely
[2022-12-23 21:21:31] <loypower> they will market the 2cp maps as new maps
[2022-12-23 21:21:31] <Roguko> because they are ''new'' and shouldnt be ''overwhelmed''
[2022-12-23 21:21:43] <%Coyly> blizzard is deciding their experience for them

[2022-12-23 21:31:10] <Roguko> somehow
[2022-12-23 21:31:12] <minimc18> fall off damage so they have to be closer, as in diveable
[2022-12-23 21:31:13] <Roguko> reveal
[2022-12-23 21:31:15] <Roguko> position
[2022-12-23 21:31:19] <Roguko> as a risk
[2022-12-23 21:31:32] <%Coyly> they did that with sojourn to force her mid-range but she still right click wins with pocket
[2022-12-23 21:31:33] <Roguko> like lets say widow gets a kill
[2022-12-23 21:31:48] <%abbzug> hmmm maybe widow could have more like a torb shotgun instead of SMG
[2022-12-23 21:31:51] <Hyamzisme> Make widow's weapon fire a laser whenever she is aiming with RMB
[2022-12-23 21:31:53] <%Coyly> against widows I do just go kiriko and duel
[2022-12-23 21:31:56] <Roguko> you get something that shows off her position even more than just a red aftershot line
[2022-12-23 21:32:00] <r1ptidestv> i think they can just rework widow, can't oneshot but she gets wallhacks on them ( forlanding a headshot ) for 3 seconds similar to sombra. headshots should definitely be rewarded just not an instakill.

[2022-12-23 21:55:10] <%Gibson5000> @Texasisgone exactly, once the hero is locked away they can't ignore it anymore
[2022-12-23 21:55:14] <mxsz_ow> true
[2022-12-23 21:55:53] <geckoEva> how would you select a ban? each player votes and then the most voted is banned?
[2022-12-23 21:55:53] <%+Texasisgone> @slushiipls sojourn is only an issue at higher ranks because she needs aim, and she is the face of OW2 imo
[2022-12-23 21:55:58] <mercythehealbot> no one talk or care about the "find group" option :(
[2022-12-23 21:56:08] <%ssonteus> should hero ban only be in ranked ?

[2022-12-23 21:57:38] <xDelgado509> most games with a competitive gamemode  already have character bans anyways

[2022-12-23 21:57:48] <%abbzug> also true

[2022-12-23 21:58:13] <%+benjaleamern> would you do a hero ban per class?
[2022-12-23 21:58:16] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> everyone would just ban hog kiriko sojourn every game
[2022-12-23 21:58:22] <%+Texasisgone> hero bans, but the players can ban the heros each game, just like league
[2022-12-23 21:58:30] <%Gibson5000> 1 tank/2 dps/1 support banned each match

[2022-12-23 21:59:42] <%+ChrisTheRookey> Ban metas are a thing, but it is what it is. It adds spice. Devs can also see which character is the most problematic according to playerbase by ban data.

[2022-12-23 22:00:18] <%+ChrisTheRookey> That's true. In R6, there is also ban meta that is very map-based.
[2022-12-23 22:00:19] <%+Texasisgone> how come sojourn rail can do 195 damage, but genji blade only does like 120 or 130?

[2022-12-23 22:06:10] <%marodas2> It often feels like it's run by kids or very young people who dont know what level of work is expected from them
[2022-12-23 22:06:14] <%+benjaleamern> 2cp discussion was fun. i remain hopeful. more tourneys would be excellent. bilzz giving into that would be great

[2022-12-23 22:07:06] <loypower> yeah share holders are what controll the game
[2022-12-23 22:07:15] <%SlushiiPls> can u say capitalism to that?
[2022-12-23 22:07:16] <%Gibson5000> If the game isn't profitable, it can't exist
[2022-12-23 22:07:54] <a_jom1> People don't understand how expensive making games is aswell
[2022-12-23 22:08:04] <%magicvariable74> Does fun = more players?
[2022-12-23 22:08:05] <%+Texasisgone> And as long as it's profitable, it won't change
[2022-12-23 22:08:11] <%+benjaleamern> bogur gets that's it all about those profits
[2022-12-23 22:08:22] <%+ChrisTheRookey> Wouldn't it attract people more to play the game and buy stuff when OW would actually be good? Like, keep the business model as is, but make the game enjoyable.
[2022-12-23 22:08:27] <%SlushiiPls> ye
[2022-12-23 22:08:33] <%+ChrisTheRookey> People will play it more and be willing to pay more.
[2022-12-23 22:08:34] <%+benjaleamern> how much do you think they're making off skins?
[2022-12-23 22:08:45] <cabreli> Fun gets people engaged, are loyal

[2022-12-23 22:17:32] <%Coyly> 2cp with like every entry being a choke was not fun

[2022-12-23 22:17:59] <Trottie_xD> atk and defending modes always favor defence tho
[2022-12-23 22:18:10] <a_jom1> I think it was an interesting pov when u talked about how they should give more options for roles to counter other roles
[2022-12-23 22:18:15] <a_jom1> kinda agree
[2022-12-23 22:18:26] <%+benjaleamern> more tournaments in general. and why not in game sign up tournaments
[2022-12-23 22:18:44] <%Coyly> how do you feel about the push maps where losing team has to work way harder to pull out a W
[2022-12-23 22:19:07] VIEWERS: 130
[2022-12-23 22:19:14] <WoundPoison> if you had to change one thing about the game what would it be
[2022-12-23 22:19:19] <a_jom1> I think tank is the best role to deal with shit and support is the worst
[2022-12-23 22:19:36] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> maybe do one of those cut sound effects like ml has in his videos
[2022-12-23 22:19:39] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> like the swoosh
[2022-12-23 22:19:49] <%Coyly> would love support role to feel more rewarding
[2022-12-23 22:20:01] <Trottie_xD> @coyly how about no forward spawn done
[2022-12-23 22:20:10] <%+ChrisTheRookey> Be gone, HOG!
[2022-12-23 22:20:26] <%Coyly> @Trottie_xD no forward spawn and robot resets to mid

[2022-12-23 22:22:01] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> i think support is more fun to play in ow2 because theres only 1 tank
[2022-12-23 22:22:04] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> u can do more
[2022-12-23 22:22:08] <makaroni400> wonton
[2022-12-23 22:22:10] <Trottie_xD> or make 3 mins rounds to see who can push it the furthest Bo3 style like koth maps @coyly no checkpoint and so
[2022-12-23 22:22:49] <%Coyly> I don't necessarily mind the higher amount of team fights but the length of the maps really pushes trickle in
[2022-12-23 22:22:55] <%Coyly> yeah 10 mins is rouuuuuugh
[2022-12-23 22:23:11] VIEWERS: 128
[2022-12-23 22:23:30] <%Coyly> it sucks if you roll and then you're at the end then you have 6 min left in the game
[2022-12-23 22:23:46] <%orcpa1adin> @メイシーちゃん cant say 1 tank is the reason, but i as well enjoy support in ow2 way more than previously
[2022-12-23 22:23:51] <Trottie_xD> maybe 7 mins and cut a 1/3 of the map away
[2022-12-23 22:24:12] <%Coyly> yeah being on the receiving end is alway worse
[2022-12-23 22:24:49] <Trottie_xD> feels like the first fight decides the game almost tho
[2022-12-23 22:24:49] <%+benjaleamern> push has some good moments though. a comeback on push is top tier
[2022-12-23 22:25:00] <%Digichanted> what if each time a capture point is taken/retaken 30seconds is removed? threshold at 2min. for push
