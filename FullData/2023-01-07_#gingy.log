[2023-01-07 15:26:17] <%gc_monster7> @jimmiedrum Had to use my phone because Twitch won’t let me logon PC linFeels
[2023-01-07 15:26:26] <%gc_monster7> At least there is no delay on mobile now

[2023-01-07 15:26:34] <%CLS2145> I have the G5 34" UW monitor
[2023-01-07 15:26:40] <Mattt_10k> @gc_monster7 theres not?
[2023-01-07 15:26:42] <@%+jimmiedrum> Indeed @iseeuplay
[2023-01-07 15:26:46] <%tbonesk> @latebreakfast Santa somehow survived round 2 with her though LUL
[2023-01-07 15:26:53] <Phatlah> @ISeeUPlay 32in isnt considered sweet spot for fps gaming
[2023-01-07 15:26:58] <Allen_N> 3x27 is a bad move
[2023-01-07 15:27:02] <%gc_monster7> @mattt_10k yep, no delay on my phone
[2023-01-07 15:27:03] <ISeeUPlay> makes sense.
[2023-01-07 15:27:05] <%Alldoped> Samsung Odyssey G5 C27G55TQWU is it this one ?
[2023-01-07 15:27:18] <+latebreakfast> i still stick to my 24"
[2023-01-07 15:27:18] <ISeeUPlay> but would make a nice secondary monitor
[2023-01-07 15:27:22] <JollyxGGx> what about them crazy 2k ultrawide oled monitors lol
[2023-01-07 15:27:22] <%Thaloc78> I run 2 x 32" monitors
[2023-01-07 15:27:30] <@%+jimmiedrum> 3 27
[2023-01-07 15:27:39] <%gc_monster7> I’d rather have 3x27” than 1 49”
[2023-01-07 15:27:47] <Mattt_10k> i have 2 27 inch and 1 32
[2023-01-07 15:27:48] <@%+jimmiedrum> if inplayed star.citizen I'd get a 49
[2023-01-07 15:27:55] <%Alldoped> Curved 27” QHD with 2,5k and 144hz is like 210 euros in denmakr atm :D
[2023-01-07 15:27:56] <%+ang3l_of_d3ath91> Do you run the game on those 3 or one for the game and the other 2 for programs

[2023-01-07 15:28:04] <Allen_N> if the game is running on all 3, its a bad experience
[2023-01-07 15:28:20] <Phatlah> You lose sharpness above 27

[2023-01-07 15:28:35] <sT1mulator_dave_Bot> 23 is nicer to watch twitch on than 27
[2023-01-07 15:28:41] <sT1mulator_dave_Bot> 32*
[2023-01-07 15:28:43] <%bobl65> bigger isnt better.... more pixel to handle on bigger screens...
[2023-01-07 15:28:45] <%gc_monster7> I have a 42” just because my gf love watching Netflix on it NotLikeThis
[2023-01-07 15:28:47] <DevonR> nooo the Christmas tree is gone my gas an was almost done :(
[2023-01-07 15:28:49] <+Inf1ni7y> depends what you're doing, if you're gaming primarily 27 is good, if you're editing and stuff too going up is good

[2023-01-07 15:28:51] <archexxe> 27 is the best size for 1440p, once you go to 32" it gets too big for your desk and you have to put it further back to fill your view but then your squinting, the pixels begin to show as well for 1440p, 32" is the start of 4K territory
[2023-01-07 15:28:59] <@%+jimmiedrum> I want one I can put sideways for twitch chat

[2023-01-07 15:29:10] <Turpcher> generally the bigger the monitor the further you should be sitting away from it
[2023-01-07 15:29:15] <+latebreakfast> @sT1mulator_dave_Bot 42 even better for watching it

[2023-01-07 16:17:18] <GlutenFreeVapes> @Gingy there were some people who got banned last wipe because of that. They were temporary bans like 1 month or sth
[2023-01-07 16:17:18] <+Mastertexan> There's only 3 ways to ban someone: account ban, IP ban, and Hardware ban. Replace any of those 3 and you're back
[2023-01-07 16:17:19] <%Alldoped> @Gingy  Do people getting perma banned? from buying with irl money ?

[2023-01-07 16:20:15] <CWilliams618> I mean it's harder to get a new IP then it is to just rebuy the cheats and start all over again in minutes

[2023-01-07 16:23:11] <archexxe> The game that's had the most success in dealing with cheaters for me is Valorant, because they install a program that looks into your OS at kernel level which isn't ideal but we're at that point where severe actions need to be taken to deal with a severe problem

[2023-01-07 16:26:27] <%Thaloc78> When there are two players making noise, it comes from everywhere as Tarkov's audio cannot process the spatial properly
[2023-01-07 16:26:34] <ShovelKing> The audio is all over the shop atm, two of my friends have messed audio where a scav might scream from across the map but their audio plays it right on top of them.
[2023-01-07 16:26:35] <%schadenfly> same exact problem
[2023-01-07 16:26:43] <BigAdaEnergy> which means shes almost alright
[2023-01-07 16:27:23] <%filet_st_eak> yeah, I notice that and I recognize it from a friend who is also totally deaf on his left ear. It always amazes me how good you are with directional audio despite that
[2023-01-07 16:27:29] <%schadenfly> it gets worse when you get older
[2023-01-07 16:27:32] <%pikapii010> Only reason im so pissed about sound and all the other issues in this game is because i know how crazy awesome it would be if it didn't have all these problems >.<

[2023-01-07 17:49:19] <@%TrillOG_> monkaHmm im not sure
[2023-01-07 17:49:23] <@%+jimmiedrum> yes @predit_noir
[2023-01-07 17:49:25] <%$FadedNerdGaming> @Predit_Noir yep
[2023-01-07 17:49:29] <+callaghan92k1> @Predit_Noir the first day was 2.5 then switched to 2, and now back to 2.5
[2023-01-07 17:49:38] <@%+jimmiedrum> ^
[2023-01-07 17:49:38] <@%^Nightbot> yeah what they said
[2023-01-07 17:49:41] <%jakcold> I very much agree! its an annoying change they made to me
[2023-01-07 17:49:53] <+Predit_Noir> Lol how does one get 5 drops in 10 hours of watching when it takes 12.5 now..
[2023-01-07 17:50:14] <@%+jimmiedrum> only 4 now
[2023-01-07 17:50:17] <+callaghan92k1> @Predit_Noir you dont, you get 4 drops in 10 hours at 2.5 hours each
[2023-01-07 17:50:23] <+Predit_Noir> Ah
[2023-01-07 17:50:36] <%$electricshock7> It's not like doors close themselves. That's what I compare it to. If someone closes it than ok, but it should stay open. Helps track people too.
