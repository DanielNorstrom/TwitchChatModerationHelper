[2022-12-17 00:19:00] <@%Mikulex> Ty
[2022-12-17 00:19:09] <@%Mikulex> How do be college doin
[2022-12-17 00:19:40] <Kagumiiin> tbh tough
[2022-12-17 00:20:10] <Kagumiiin> I'm managing to keep my head above the water but with how things are run its quite hard
[2022-12-17 00:20:30] <Kagumiiin> halfassing professors and almost no other students to rely to if I miss a lesson
[2022-12-17 00:21:13] <@%Mikulex> pmelDead
[2022-12-17 00:21:16] <Kagumiiin> and dorm life is very despair
[2022-12-17 00:21:22] <@%Mikulex> Ye
[2022-12-17 00:21:40] <Kagumiiin> I had to ruin my sleep to be able to study in comfort
[2022-12-17 00:21:58] <@%Mikulex> Still have the interest in Telecom itself tho?
[2022-12-17 00:22:04] <Kagumiiin> yea
[2022-12-17 00:22:13] <@%Mikulex> That's gud
[2022-12-17 00:22:13] <Kagumiiin> if I wasn't I would have quit
[2022-12-17 00:22:17] <@%Mikulex> Ye
[2022-12-17 00:22:22] <Kagumiiin> and worked on some certs
[2022-12-17 00:22:49] <Kagumiiin> going back to dorm life from 7 to 12 pm internet is throddled and there are parties left and right
[2022-12-17 00:22:50] <@%Mikulex> Towards some or did you manage to get some?
[2022-12-17 00:23:00] <Kagumiiin> so I have to study from 12pm to 6 am
[2022-12-17 00:23:20] <Kagumiiin> (towards some if I dropped out I meant)
[2022-12-17 00:23:20] <@%Mikulex> I've been working for a year now and I'm still in a dorm cause fuck rent prices lmao
[2022-12-17 00:23:48] <Kagumiiin> free dorm ?
[2022-12-17 00:23:54] <@%Mikulex> Nah
[2022-12-17 00:24:20] <@%Mikulex> Too smol for me to be comfortable but cheap af for local urban averages
[2022-12-17 00:24:20] <Kagumiiin> are you alone at least
[2022-12-17 00:24:26] <@%Mikulex> Nah
[2022-12-17 00:24:31] <@%Mikulex> That's why it sucks so muxh
[2022-12-17 00:24:37] <Kagumiiin> rip
[2022-12-17 00:25:20] <Kagumiiin> I managed to snipe a room solo
[2022-12-17 00:25:31] <@%Mikulex> apriPog
[2022-12-17 00:25:35] <Kagumiiin> it's a big improvement from alst year
[2022-12-17 00:25:49] <Kagumiiin> last guy i was way too talky
[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <Kagumiiin> and doesn't understand the concept of I just want to sit in my corner unbothered
[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <@%Mikulex> YAPPP
[2022-12-17 00:26:21] <Kagumiiin> "what are you doing" every 10 minutes mustirDespair
[2022-12-17 00:26:35] <@%Mikulex> Sounds cringe
[2022-12-17 00:27:37] <Kagumiiin> yeah but since he had connections with many people here I never told him and kept touch with him
[2022-12-17 00:28:11] <Kagumiiin> after a while keeping up a mask gets tiring
[2022-12-17 00:28:59] <@%Mikulex> Ye
[2022-12-17 00:30:11] <@%Mikulex> How many semesters are you in?
[2022-12-17 00:30:48] <Kagumiiin> halfway through the 3rd
[2022-12-17 00:31:00] <Kagumiiin> (counting all uni )
[2022-12-17 00:31:24] <@%Mikulex> How many to finish? 6?
