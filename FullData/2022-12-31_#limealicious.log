[2022-12-31 00:25:28] <Dessart> yeah, from that evga ordeal we learned that nvidia keep a lot of info to them, so the third parties overcompensated
[2022-12-31 00:25:29] <%kronis_0> i would love a 4090 but its scalped at like $2300 minimum
[2022-12-31 00:25:29] <Dragonator_g> Now the coolers are a problem because they're so big and heavy they bend and sag because they still only use 2 mount points for the case.
[2022-12-31 00:25:33] <@%Greygull> 3090 to 4090 was totally reasonable
[2022-12-31 00:25:37] <+archmagnance> @wolf3618 bad if you think about paying for something thats overengineering for no reason
[2022-12-31 00:25:37] <@%Greygull> That was a $100 increase

[2022-12-31 00:26:03] <%+sc00tz0r> if your not a professional its not worth cost, imo

[2022-12-31 00:47:06] <BrokenCompiler> @Greygull It pretty much is, there's a post about it on the reddit

[2022-12-31 00:47:24] <+ghost_mira> Dwarf Therapist is only needed if you do stuff like like start a fort when your race is extinct and you only get your started dorfs
[2022-12-31 00:47:24] <@%Greygull> That's good to know
[2022-12-31 00:47:26] <BrokenCompiler> If you really want control, you can restrict workshops to a specified dwarf
[2022-12-31 00:47:40] <R26xx> therapist also has searching and sorting options, so looking at your dwarves is easier
[2022-12-31 00:47:53] <Leud_De_Grace> I do appreciate dwaves actually doing stuff compared to earlier versions

[2022-12-31 00:48:03] <%$DragooKnight11> Yeah but you can’t assign multiple dwarves to a workshop, or a minimum skill level, to ensure a dabbling woodworker never makes beds without several workshops
[2022-12-31 00:48:04] <%$peekas0> Renaming dwarves is also easier in it.

[2022-12-31 01:32:06] <+ghost_mira> @SsnakeyB Does real life have a win condition or do you just keep going until you die
[2022-12-31 01:32:06] <%TsunamiAromatic> @Greygull Once you've become the capitol it's technically the win-state now. There isn't an endstate though
[2022-12-31 01:32:10] <+jakeyjakeyy> if you dont die horribly its fun to retire the fort and check back on it later after it runs naturally for a while

[2022-12-31 01:43:10] <AMERICA_YEA> world generation and location of your fort can also have a HUGE impact on the difficulty

[2022-12-31 22:41:49] <Rocker26a> Talking about Overwatch's gameplay being lousy in one form or another feels like what I'd imagine complaining about our team's performance 5 World Cups ago must be like.

[2022-12-31 22:42:46] <Justjake274> It doesn't sound like the game is actually a full sequel, so whatever playerbase was active from the 7 year old Overwatch 1 isn't getting any sort of boost

[2022-12-31 23:34:58] <Mr_Sparcler> genshin is fun at the beggining, but it gets stale with time, doesnt help devs dont actually focus on improving core game, they are just adding more to it, making it wider not better to play essentially i
[2022-12-31 23:34:58] <samiam1616> Oh my god Laimubot made a coherent joke
