[2023-01-02 22:58:56] <rindred> Just an expression where someone asks if they're terribly repulsive (i.e. chopped liver).
[2023-01-02 22:59:11] <@%Wloos> The chopped liver thing is "one that is insignificant or not worth considering"

[2023-01-02 22:59:44] <%Slayina> Honestly I never thought of a ranking for streamers I watch but I would definitely have Ari in the Top 5 or 3. Would have to put more thought into it and look at my list of streamers
