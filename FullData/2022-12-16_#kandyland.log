[2022-12-16 09:05:16] <zeelandfeyenoorder> @finyfik @a_dragon_raised_by_wolves @finyfik Another very important, very underappreciated, reason for Russias invasion of Crimea and Ukraine is the access to the Black Sea. Russia really doesnt have any warm water naval bases other than the ones all the way in the north-west near Finland. With Crimea's access to the black sea they suddenly have access to more warm water naval options and trade.
