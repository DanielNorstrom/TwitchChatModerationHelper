[2022-12-29 02:39:17] <redfluffypillow> it would be nice for a new epic skin just so the people who chose to buy it don't feel like their favorite shirt just got sold to Walmart. bad analogy üòë

[2022-12-29 02:40:12] <@^Nightbot> Drops are working, if you are on mobile the progression bar isn't showing up but it is tracking your progress.
[2022-12-29 02:40:21] <redfluffypillow> I could set a device to watch streams 247 if it were coins per hr
[2022-12-29 02:40:28] <notkev2021> Honestly I would rather have a lootbox every hour or 2 hours watched because you could get coins from there too
[2022-12-29 02:40:29] <@%rogue_entity> They just slap a new color palette over the existing Mesh, sims modders do it all the time it doesn't take that long broyouClown
[2022-12-29 02:40:38] <redfluffypillow> not me, but lots of people. it'll ruin the flow
[2022-12-29 02:40:45] <@%ChristalRaine> Btw fyi your camera is super off center
[2022-12-29 02:41:04] <+biscuit34254> you can get more skins in overwatch 1 than 2

[2022-12-29 02:43:42] <!%+Grimreaper3103> The problem is that they are selling the skins for the same prices as fortnite but these skins are for 1 hero out of 30+ heros compared to  Fortnite where you use 1 skin at a time it does not seem fair

[2022-12-29 02:44:42] <clowmona> the problem in overwatch 2 is that it's too overpriced for just one skin, like one skin can cost 20 dollars and it ain't even that good
[2022-12-29 02:44:45] <bubbleberriies> asmr
[2022-12-29 02:44:51] <redfluffypillow> I'd appreciate the products costing a little less, but I spend as much as I intend to spend either way

[2022-12-29 02:48:14] <%swanstimesthree> my biggest problem is the lack or currency and how bland it feels to progress now
[2022-12-29 02:48:20] <clowmona> I do agree this will give the game much more money then previously , first time I spent alot for overwatch
[2022-12-29 02:48:21] <@%ChristalRaine> Wait what did Star Wars battlefront do
[2022-12-29 02:48:26] <ovenfire> Wait so in overwatch 1 we‚Äôre if you won a sertion amount of games and get the loot boxes that way would that be considered gambling
[2022-12-29 02:48:33] <@%rogue_entity> lootboxes are pretty much a Gacha system
[2022-12-29 02:48:39] <greatwaif94586> They need to make weekly challenges give out more coins
