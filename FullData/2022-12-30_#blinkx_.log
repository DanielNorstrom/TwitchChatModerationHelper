[2022-12-30 16:27:55] <Kupru91> I would say that 3080 on laptop mayde a waste, because of the powerlimit. PC has way more powerfull Powersupply
[2022-12-30 16:27:57] <%Warfiend81> Depends on your needs.  For me laptop is better because I spend so much time not at home gaming.  If I got a desktop it would barely get used.  I always run plugged in
