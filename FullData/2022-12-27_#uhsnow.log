[2022-12-27 13:18:10] <+SpellRED> companies like BMW make a competition version of the car with a louder exhaust and cooler features so that the customer spends more money @uhSnow

[2022-12-27 13:18:19] <JamesF699_> yeah you think the quiet one would be the option

[2022-12-27 13:18:38] <kahuma> might be that the stock has to follow the sound rule thingy but aftermarkets dont
[2022-12-27 13:18:39] <%+ninjat_rexarmy> bc then why would anyone spend extra money on the akrapovich exhaust?

[2022-12-27 14:42:01] <+Kam_> the issue is you're conflating the fight for independence by countries following the end of the first and second world wars and the inability for the UK to a) hold mass land effectively 2) the economic infeeibility of the UK to maintain colonies, with the queen "helping" to give them up. She actively fought to keep them, she just failed. Sorry for the paragraph, its a more complicated issue that you make it out to be

[2022-12-27 16:10:18] <%Jmannice> Snow is it bad in American weight?
[2022-12-27 16:10:24] <+ThrashingBacon> ive started at the gym this month and its done wonders, plus being ill over christmas is helping me avoid eating so much
[2022-12-27 16:10:27] <+elenafae> i had to stop and think you meant in kilos as triple digits cause in pounds/lbs triple digits is normal lol
[2022-12-27 16:10:31] <NohhMe> My biggest problem is to figure out how start a proper diet. Rn i just started to eat less generally
[2022-12-27 16:10:31] <%worstboomkinna> its crazy how weight varies from person to person. im 6'4 and weigh 200lbs and all i do is drink beer, smoke, and eat unhealthy food. no weird flex intended.
[2022-12-27 16:10:34] <+McCape7> Snow is as tall as Neymar. Ok he is professional athlete but he weight 68 kilos for reference. 105 is ooooverweight
[2022-12-27 16:10:41] <%+Tr0nck> I lost 25 pounds to depression, dropped down to 185, and was super unhealthy, so there is still a ton of variance around 200 for people between probably 5'9 and 6'3
[2022-12-27 16:10:47] <GodIsD3AD762> @NohhMe yea the proper units
[2022-12-27 16:11:06] <%Apitoxin11> McCape7 before the diet uhSnow had as many rolls as Neymar too
