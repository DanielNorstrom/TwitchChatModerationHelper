[2022-12-18 20:43:50] <$santtuhehe> I like low energy people
[2022-12-18 20:43:52] <Ziiltch> best vtuber lore: "I didnt want to show my face"
[2022-12-18 20:43:54] <Blueshadow230> I recently discovered this adhd music that are like remixes of two songs mashed into each other, they're good
[2022-12-18 20:43:57] <CountTwo> Your lore should be that you were editing pokimane videos, fell asleep and woke up in your favorite video game.
