[2022-12-29 00:00:46] <+breeches_> @Vohveliz feels bad. I had both shotguns on a raid and was one tapped by an adar scav with 855a1, right through my class4

[2022-12-29 00:02:15] <bobthemutant> random items actually being importan
[2022-12-29 00:02:17] <%KevinSredz> @cosiek11 in my opinion it sucks.
[2022-12-29 00:02:23] <%+FrostyyTheSnowThug> you could do that if they make almost everything fir
[2022-12-29 00:02:27] <Vohveliz> I feel like there'd have to be some "your stash got raided by scavs and you lost your money" global events for that to ever happen without just wipes
[2022-12-29 00:02:31] <+DrFartAton> PMCs should "retire" after a while, (the base upgrades remains) but the items are gone. @Klean
[2022-12-29 00:02:34] <%+MTReese_> I love wipe so much, its way more immersive than late wipe
[2022-12-29 00:02:35] <%DespiseTheirLies> so much more novelty in early wipe

[2022-12-29 00:05:13] <renodemron> ye game loop for a grinde game u have this loop in the erly game but not in late game, a good grinde game whit good game loop is MH exp
[2022-12-29 00:05:21] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> its nice both ways too, like it feels bad when you are running altyn and slick and get 2 shot with good ammo. Getting stacked early feels so cool because you have acutal firefights
[2022-12-29 00:05:28] <%+StealthyHazboola> kleanWeed Let me prep my herbal essence
[2022-12-29 00:05:43] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> they just need to nerf good ammo availability
[2022-12-29 00:05:49] <suo77> @TokkyoZ new sound is only implemented on factory, woods, customs and streets right now
[2022-12-29 00:06:05] <TokkyoZ> @suo77 AH fuck thats why ok ok
[2022-12-29 00:06:07] <%KevinSredz> @JAM_AINT_JELLY thats literally the main thing they need to do to keep early-wipe gameplay
[2022-12-29 00:06:21] <+kgozi> 8 ads back to back wtf never seen that before
[2022-12-29 00:06:35] <+KennyD_444> the best gear should trickle into theater, like a real escalating proxy war whatever you want to call whats happening in tarkov
[2022-12-29 00:06:41] <%KevinSredz> AKM is my favorite gun but literally unusable in this game Sadge

[2022-12-29 00:07:00] <%Ljosapaldr> I mean a lot of the equipment stats are already gameyfied, why is one grip 5 another 1? lol
[2022-12-29 00:07:07] <TokkyoZ> (i agree with you)

[2022-12-29 00:07:30] <RPSafari> i agreee. i always thought it was nonsensical that for example, a BCM foregrip gives you less ergo/recoil than say, the fortis shift
[2022-12-29 00:07:42] <Goldie_Gun> nerf 9x18 Boomer
[2022-12-29 00:08:01] <%Ljosapaldr> @RPSafari yeah a lot of the stats are so random, if anything I feel like *more* realism would give klean what he wants
[2022-12-29 00:08:02] <TokkyoZ> The différents attachment stats block community from normal gun / cool gun
[2022-12-29 00:08:04] <+Chambiez> i wish more people ran night raids with flashlights. turns into a horror game and is so fun
[2022-12-29 00:08:15] <Miklo_FromBor> i love your take on this topic.
[2022-12-29 00:08:26] <cup0joe1668> Last wipe I used only bolt actions had level 20 snipers before the end wipe events

[2022-12-29 00:08:43] <jaykay44> @Chambiez it's already a horror game... is there a cheater over the next hill?  probably.

[2022-12-29 00:09:04] <RPSafari> @Ljosapaldr agreed. it would, imho, absolutely feel more realistic than seeing every PMC run the same 4 attachments on AK's, AR's, SMG's etc
[2022-12-29 00:09:13] <vadaszka140> @Chambiez Most likely
[2022-12-29 00:09:14] <%cheddie310> Instructions unclear, Stim injected into Penis
[2022-12-29 00:09:20] <+jamesthejoker> What if ammo differences mattered against scavs and scav bosses, but not against PMCs?
[2022-12-29 00:09:39] <+Goodbrah1> Anyone else taking forever to load in to a mtach?
[2022-12-29 00:09:43] <%Ljosapaldr> @RPSafari if attachments had that big quality differences all guns in real life would look the same, lol, and they clearly don't
[2022-12-29 00:10:03] <RPSafari> @Ljosapaldr big facts
[2022-12-29 00:10:06] <Goldie_Gun> niche builds are far more exciting than min max dullness
[2022-12-29 00:10:07] <+jamesthejoker> That way you keep the realism but also keep the pvp fun
[2022-12-29 00:10:14] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> I feel like with ammo too there should be like a overall "best ammo" there should be like 3 ammos that are good for different things.
[2022-12-29 00:10:17] <%+StealthyHazboola> Am I infering right, chat wants a realistic Tarkov, I want immersive Tarkov kleanActually Not the same thing
[2022-12-29 00:10:28] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> shouldn't be*

[2022-12-29 00:11:34] <%Ljosapaldr> @StealthyHazboola Well no, what we want is for people to be able to build cool guns, and now compare +5 and +4 foregrips to maximize versus price. Two of us just agreed that fixing this is not just better gameplay, but *also* more realism.
[2022-12-29 00:11:42] <MunchiesMcGee> who coulda guessed it LUL

[2022-12-29 13:21:18] <+hellcat_333> I like drops fine when its a while into wipe, not a fan when its right at the start
[2022-12-29 13:21:35] [Announcement] <Sev07Sniper> DROPS ARE ON! !Link if you're a newbie and need to connect your twitch to tarkov <3
[2022-12-29 13:21:42] <aus_degenerate_gaming> oh ok yep cool. Jesus no need for the chat to carry on it's just a word typed in chat.... can't be worse than people saying they want to fight me and abusing me for just trying to activate drops before I go to bed for work.
[2022-12-29 13:21:46] <+hellcat_333> Early wipe is enough of a trash fire without the drops lol
[2022-12-29 13:21:53] <@%+Sev07Sniper> you're not being abused lmao

[2022-12-29 13:57:40] <%LegitBanana_> because nothin else is viable
[2022-12-29 13:57:54] <+SwipMeister> there are way too many ammo types for some calibers tbh
[2022-12-29 13:57:57] <%SlanAbhaile> Bigger bullet means a bigger hole which means less bad guys, that's just science @Klean

[2022-12-29 14:22:44] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @5cavlive5matt3r I'm not against the idea of learning recoil control but the default is too bad. BSG wants to encourage slower gunfire but most ammo is too weak for that.

[2022-12-29 14:48:03] <%+SiLoNoVa> I can confirm RN that this has been my best wipe by far, just found the third gaz an KEKW
[2022-12-29 14:48:07] <Jedisssss> sometimes I feel like I'm shooting with paper bullets in Tarkov
[2022-12-29 14:48:07] <+Kernel420> stats games will always have metas, just like mmo's
[2022-12-29 14:48:08] <%+StealthyHazboola> Kit diversity needed
[2022-12-29 14:48:09] <%Hange88> It's avalable at lv 2 to buy but same at lv 1 for trade and the items are easy to find for the trade
[2022-12-29 14:48:13] <%Error23UK> Nothing but broken skav AK's early game is the best kinda early game
[2022-12-29 14:48:21] <+NoCowardShit> Big Agree. I think mixing up the early game is good. So many guns and ammo in this game. Moving away from the CoD/Min Max stuff for as long as possible is so good for the health of the game.
[2022-12-29 14:48:22] <+kylepunk13> Its interesting how this game is always great early wipe but then it gets meh after 2 months.
[2022-12-29 14:48:24] <fur3x> Found the new marked key for streets
[2022-12-29 14:48:30] <%Ljosapaldr> The metas are weird in the context of a realistic military game, because if guns were *that* easily separated into 'good' and 'bad'
[2022-12-29 14:48:32] <+NoCowardShit> Literally any bullet can kill anyway!
[2022-12-29 14:48:40] <@%$Ripper203> Tried the UMP once, wasn't a fan and went back to the MP5. Just needed the SD variant kleanMmm
[2022-12-29 14:48:40] <PinkGuy_120> true tho
[2022-12-29 14:48:41] <siddo__> @SgtJohnsonsJohnson there will always be a meta, something that in absolute terms is the best, that fine, as long as sightly deviating from the meta doesnt matter massively
[2022-12-29 14:48:43] <%Ljosapaldr> then all militaries would use the same guns with the same attachements

[2022-12-29 14:49:12] <+GL0CKenspeil> i wish they would try only being able to level 1 or 2 traders not be able to have all traders maxed. be fun to try imo
[2022-12-29 14:49:12] <+Radenlol> @Ljosapaldr I mean its also dependent on money and connections etc
[2022-12-29 14:49:20] <%Marcskel> Ahhhhh
[2022-12-29 14:49:22] <+NoCowardShit> I'm also a fan of the idea of switching the butt pocket to be once you remove something from it in raid, it cannot go back. I'd love to get more value out of PVP/have more risk when I have high value loot.

[2022-12-29 14:50:29] <+GL0CKenspeil> @Kernel420 the fact that weapon attachments make weapons objectively better also supports the min/max gameplay which is not a great mechanic

[2022-12-29 14:50:29] <PinkGuy_120> yes

[2022-12-29 14:53:32] <+NoCowardShit> @NoCowardShit Yeah. Just my personal style is I get a thrill with the risk there. A big part of this game for me is the survival horror elements/tension. RE Series is my favorite games and I love what Tarkov takes from them.

[2022-12-29 15:08:26] <GrandpaClamps> @GL0CKenspeil don't do that. Modern CPUs only have 2 channels, even though the mother board allows for 4 slots. The CPU will have to take turns between which 2 RAM it speaks with at one time. Best to just upgrade and stick with 2 RAM.

[2022-12-29 16:11:56] <%RyseUpGaming> 100% correct. The US is all about money, and whats the best way to get people to pay is to make health care extremely expensive, and fast food cheap to help aid in health issues. but make healthy food expensice so the people are almost forced to eat like shit based on thier income and such

[2022-12-29 17:28:50] <cancerous_reply> @DoofEmpire Any map except reserve and labs is fine for newcomers, ppl just repeat "customs" for no good reason. Just find one with quick queues
[2022-12-29 17:28:56] <%5cavlive5matt3r> So I followed some advice and turned off binural audio. I still get 30-45 FPS in Streets, but the map runs smoothly and doesn't stutter. Also have it on medium graphics. So I can play Streets! At least I think.

[2022-12-29 18:22:33] <Shinsei> @k0dey In my opinion, this game is so punishing that learning combat takes a lot of time unless you just drop into Factory and duke it out until you're fairly comfortable.

[2022-12-29 18:42:47] <+JBro21> its impossible to be quiet in this game
[2022-12-29 18:42:51] <+soxfan5240> @Shinsei pretty much just have to assume you are never quiet. everything in this game is loud
[2022-12-29 18:42:54] <+KonceptionZ> when u think they heard u they probably alrady did @Shinsei

[2022-12-29 18:43:14] <%+k0dey> I had a guy call me out last night after doing that. Makes more sense now
[2022-12-29 18:43:15] <%+FrostyyTheSnowThug> if you go lowest speed and wasd and turn mouse i think its silent
[2022-12-29 18:43:19] <Tmmy2ooTuff> all movement makes some amount of noise
[2022-12-29 18:43:23] <%Crit91> @trapys depends because of stealth and perception levels
[2022-12-29 18:43:31] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> even aiming down sight makes a noise
[2022-12-29 18:43:32] <%+TheYellaKing> @Shinsei a lot of the times it just depends on the pacing of your enemy. If theyre sprinting around a lot, you can get away with a normal walk speed easily.
[2022-12-29 18:43:38] <+Remo2108> shouldn't that barb wire make noise?
[2022-12-29 18:43:45] <trapys> @trapys so was there a change or is it just audio being diffrent?

[2022-12-29 19:41:22] <+sh0o_> how can our ancestors rely only on meat alone to sustain their diet?
[2022-12-29 19:41:27] <%Ljosapaldr> @zilthemill Hopefully you don't think I should base my diet around what bacteria consume :b
[2022-12-29 19:41:29] <+sh0o_> simply doesnt make any sense

[2022-12-29 19:45:28] <$MFAM_WildR> @Klean most streamers i watch have been turning it off
[2022-12-29 19:45:29] <+nahholmes> 0.0% of people can look like liver king without roids.  His abs alone are a dead giveaway that is the most ninja turtle gut ive ever seen
[2022-12-29 19:45:34] <%Majestic_Ham> The patch notes said to turn binaural off didn’t they?
[2022-12-29 19:45:34] <+aamef> @maddogbg27 Not sure what the people are telling you. But if you run m2 nvme ssd’s it won’t matter which drive tarkov is on. Doesn’t matter anymore. Anyone who says otherwise is doing so based on old info. Google will confirm ;)
[2022-12-29 19:45:39] <+static2three> a few people are saying its good you just gotta get used to it, but i think theres more to it than that

[2022-12-29 20:35:32] <+arch_dawg> I’ve seen multiple studies and tests demonstrating that shot placement is far more critical in common pistol calibers than the size of the round.

[2022-12-29 20:38:08] <AmaTerasu360> Using the SVD?

[2022-12-29 20:39:10] <+aamef> @annual_anteater That's because most people who end up sticking around either started with EOD, or goes to upgrade. :D

[2022-12-29 20:41:35] <GrandpaClamps> @capttainbuckyohare to start offline match you must use your PMC character then choose it b4 finishing the Ready Up. You can even turn off enemy AI in the ready up settings

[2022-12-29 20:55:16] <+FatherOwens> @oplyyy thats such a terrible take.  thats not why they arent stopping cheaters haha

[2022-12-29 20:57:41] <+oplyyy> @FatherOwens Not a terrible take at all, beyond obvious, inputting a simple number will quite literally stop majority of players from cheating, Ip/hardware bans. Actual algorithms that can detect players teleporting / moving their characters on different axes. If a player is above a certain point on a Z axis that should permit an insta ban. There's thousands if not millions of ways to protect legitimate players.

[2022-12-29 20:58:39] <Shinsei> That report list concept can backfire when the people who always claim people are cheating see that 200 people on their list isnt banned.
[2022-12-29 20:58:41] <BoppyDoodleSkip> @oplyyy if they were doing a good job they would actually be making more money, you are foolish to think they are ignoring cheaters and thus making bank off that when in reality if they had ban waves constantly going out they would in return force those players to rebuy copies because they will not stop cheating with one ban

[2022-12-29 21:35:45] <HillzHavEyes> @flinky1 reduce weight
[2022-12-29 21:35:48] <+Zlaapy> @flinky1 its due to the weight of the bag, less weight mean they keep more stamina
[2022-12-29 21:35:51] <+Utah_Hockey> @flinky1 dropping weight makes you move faster and recover stamina more quickly
[2022-12-29 21:35:54] <%+TheVixx> @flinky1 drop backpack to get lighter, you move faster.
[2022-12-29 21:36:02] <%WolfTweak> @flinky1 immediate reduction in weight to allow quicker movement due to game mechanics

[2022-12-29 21:49:55] <+padawanyolo> @Mrshilka Hopefully they can be banned faster there, considering there is a lot more kills per minute than regular Tarkov. Basically means more data to rely on. But depends on how much BSG will be on top of it

[2022-12-29 22:25:38] <@%GryphonM> guys just think about it, long scav timers are due to more people trying to scav than playing PMC, so there arent as many available raids for scavs to join

[2022-12-29 22:39:46] <jishin> any1 has the issue that Ur getting DCed after Like 1-3 mins into the raid? it Just says Connection to Server failed or something
[2022-12-29 22:39:53] <Crit_c> I use Magnesium Glutimate. It has a higher uptake than Mag-Citrate, so you only need like 1/4 of what you normally need with Citrate.
[2022-12-29 22:40:02] <@%GryphonM> @thecensoredlord much better now kleanTef

[2022-12-29 22:40:24] <%+FuzzyMountainBeaver> magnesium makes me sleep like a god damn rock
[2022-12-29 22:40:31] <GUCCIMANELAFLARE1017> Do you also take zinc?
[2022-12-29 22:40:31] <just_gorka> kleanWeed
[2022-12-29 22:40:38] <%RyseUpGaming> Magnesium Glycinate
[2022-12-29 22:40:40] <+jonnyboiyoi> i prefer lead
[2022-12-29 22:40:43] <%ForsaikenRedskye> or just do THC bro kleanSmokin
[2022-12-29 22:40:45] <hanzel666> @Crit_c but does it matter if i just take more, i still have a box
[2022-12-29 22:40:47] <%ForsaikenRedskye> Kappa
[2022-12-29 22:40:50] <wagnersuperior> magnesium is definitely a night time one
[2022-12-29 22:40:55] <%RyseUpGaming> That’s one of the most effective magnesium’s you can take
[2022-12-29 22:40:58] <@%thecensoredlord> that's an astronauts breakfast
[2022-12-29 22:40:59] <wagnersuperior> my gf takes it before bed
[2022-12-29 22:40:59] <+DarkPrometheus112> yeah i do it before bed. much much easier
[2022-12-29 22:41:06] <GUCCIMANELAFLARE1017> magnesium is recommended about 30min before sleep, and dont ingest milk beforehand
[2022-12-29 22:41:12] <@%thecensoredlord> ohhh LOL
[2022-12-29 22:41:17] <%$Deezil_Wood> @jishin try changing different servers in the launcher, sounds like ping/latency kick?
[2022-12-29 22:41:17] <Iggy347> @klean what are you recommended must play games to pick up during a steam sale?
[2022-12-29 22:41:18] <@%+r4mbe> @thecensoredlord true
[2022-12-29 22:41:18] <+Marmbo> Salmon Avocado?
[2022-12-29 22:41:18] <%+FuzzyMountainBeaver> isnt too much vitamin D dangerous, like do you get your levels checked?
[2022-12-29 22:41:25] <%hiroshi_87> kleanGasm eggs benny kleanMmm
[2022-12-29 22:41:31] <hanzel666> @Klean i take zinc with the mag before bed
[2022-12-29 22:41:36] <Rojesku> animal fats work the best
[2022-12-29 22:41:41] <+Overcast22> It’s called a supplement for a reason. You take it in supplement with food.
[2022-12-29 22:41:42] <LVviper> eggs benny is good
[2022-12-29 22:41:47] <ItsRajev> Magnesium will 100% make you feel like that if taken in the morning @Klean
[2022-12-29 22:41:56] <%RyseUpGaming> D3 can calcify at a higher amount depending on one’s nutrition etc
[2022-12-29 22:42:03] <+metabanger> most vitamins are fat soluble, except any B vitamin and C
[2022-12-29 22:42:03] <+DarkPrometheus112> @FuzzyMountainBeaver no anything with D or B your body just pisses out if it doesn't need it
[2022-12-29 22:42:05] <Crit_c> @hanzel666 apart from digestive issues, it's just preference. I have a naturally high metabolism so the citrate would just go right through me.
[2022-12-29 22:42:07] <%+succulenthamm> Luckily I am moridibly obese, I have tons of fat that my body can use that way Kappa
[2022-12-29 22:42:16] <%+Zoomafou> I used to take magnesium to help sleep, maybe placebo but it made me feel drowsier
[2022-12-29 22:42:20] <%RyseUpGaming> K3 with d3 is great to help your body utilize that d3
[2022-12-29 22:42:20] <GUCCIMANELAFLARE1017> @Overcast22 or as a supplementation if you dont get enough through regular diet

[2022-12-29 23:56:54] <Punch_McJudochop> total noob here, just bought the game last night. If I'm a scav and I see other scavs, should I kill them?

[2022-12-29 23:57:45] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> You guys use binaural audio? And you turn off surround sound?
[2022-12-29 23:57:47] <%ForsaikenRedskye> i hear them perfectly. o-o
[2022-12-29 23:58:02] <tewbs> @Punch_McJudochop up to you, but you will lose karma and other scavs will become hostile to you so might be best not to
[2022-12-29 23:58:29] <Punch_McJudochop> @Punch_McJudochop got it, thanks
[2022-12-29 23:58:43] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @NeWkLeaR1992 i never use anything and i hear everything where it should be when using binaural
[2022-12-29 23:58:47] <+sirbiggusdiccus> @punch_mcjudochop highly recommend you don't shoot anyone other than PMC's as a scav. a good rule of thumb is...if the AI Scavs are shooting at someone so can you
