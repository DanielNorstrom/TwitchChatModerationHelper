[2022-12-27 11:30:23] <!HawoooBakeinu> Chat would never let Ceri down indeed.
[2022-12-27 11:30:28] <!HawoooBakeinu> And Chat would never give up Ceri.
[2022-12-27 11:30:34] <Rahsed> Are there different tengu kinds? Maybe you're not a crow tengu but an owl tengu and that's why you're always sleepy Kappa
[2022-12-27 11:30:35] <!HawoooBakeinu> Chat would also never roll around and desert you!

[2022-12-27 11:31:14] <%Iffiie> Cheer100 If you ask Rick Astley for a DVD of the movie “Up”, he will not give it to you because he is Never Gonna Give You Up. However by not giving you Up, even though you asked for it, he is letting you down. The Astley Paradox.

[2022-12-27 13:21:45] <@%LT_Jakal> yeah if you buy the most expensive items first, you end up saving 500k in the end

[2022-12-27 13:23:40] <E_Tap> curse makes it so you get more exp, but you gotta get a build to the point it can handle it

[2022-12-27 15:18:23] <immic_> The game has a limit on XP gems, so once it reaches that point a "red gem" is made and it has all the excess XP points, it's why sometimes you get that "12 levelups in a row" situation

[2022-12-27 15:25:03] <TamarynTentagon> Ye. That does work. But chests accumulate and start lagging after few hours.
