[2022-12-26 13:12:44] <Valstrias> A permanent is just a card
[2022-12-26 13:12:49] <NotRasheed> no, create works with specific cards you put on your sideboard
[2022-12-26 13:12:59] <NotRasheed> permanent is anycard that stays on the board that isnt a land
[2022-12-26 13:13:13] <NotRasheed> the only rng is card draw
[2022-12-26 13:13:21] <@%+xahverius> NotRasheed what's your favourite MTG or snap?
[2022-12-26 13:13:32] <metaGL> lands are also permanents
[2022-12-26 13:13:43] <metaGL> the cards specifies though "nonland permanents"
[2022-12-26 13:13:47] <@%qnerr> the 2 was better
[2022-12-26 13:13:58] <NotRasheed> @xahverius i played snap once in the past month, im top 1000 in magic. so i guess that says how much i play LUL
[2022-12-26 13:14:12] <@%qnerr> ah maybe not
[2022-12-26 13:14:14] <@%qnerr> nvm
[2022-12-26 13:14:20] <@%+xahverius> top 1000 Pog

[2022-12-26 13:16:19] <NotRasheed> poison, if it damages anything that thing dies

[2022-12-26 13:17:36] <@%+xahverius> like how many different decks are played?
