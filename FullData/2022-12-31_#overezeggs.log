[2022-12-31 03:40:58] <!%willrob87> HI EGG
[2022-12-31 03:41:07] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> nah, nah I think he went to leave and get milk, I don't believe you
[2022-12-31 03:41:13] <!%CoopKaiju> But what about my feelings, Dad. Worldwide peace can wait
[2022-12-31 03:41:19] <%$brahslaws> Naruto is literally brokering peace agreements and still making it home for dinner unlike his dad
[2022-12-31 03:41:28] <!%+operatorviera> that seems more like a sasuke thing nema
[2022-12-31 03:41:31] <%$AbbyssalChimera> I mean, it's not like he, idk, goes off for all sorts of fights, training, and dies a bit only to be wished back to continue
[2022-12-31 03:41:31] <%FallenAngel0103> mitsuki is cool
[2022-12-31 03:41:42] <%$girlswearbeanies> mitsuki is really tight
[2022-12-31 03:41:48] <%$nemafow> I be honest I have never watched Naruto even once @operatorviera
[2022-12-31 03:42:00] <%$nemafow> But it always looks super cringe, and not the good time
[2022-12-31 03:42:06] <%FallenAngel0103> @AbbyssalChimera that sounds like goku KEKW

[2022-12-31 03:42:45] <%$nemafow> By saying its horrible
[2022-12-31 03:42:55] <%$brahslaws> It pisses me off because Boruto has a sheltered and good life, and Naruto literally grew up getting dunked on by the entire village
[2022-12-31 03:42:57] <%FallenAngel0103> and he treats the shadow clone like its not even him!
[2022-12-31 03:42:58] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> why doesn't Naruto send a shadow clone to broker peace KEKW
[2022-12-31 03:42:58] <%deputyimasian> baruto spoiler, hes a child!
[2022-12-31 03:43:06] <%$girlswearbeanies> Naruto makes me cry like a baby
[2022-12-31 03:43:08] <%FallenAngel0103> like my guy! that is STILL YOUR FATHER KEKW
[2022-12-31 03:43:12] <%$nemafow> doit.jpg
[2022-12-31 03:43:18] <%$brahslaws> Like bro Naruto is now loved by everyone who literally wanted him to drop dead
[2022-12-31 03:43:27] <%haiddon> I've heard that the boruto manga is a lot better than the anime
[2022-12-31 03:43:29] <TheBestStove> we have the context of naruto and what he has been through so it will always downplay how baruto sees the world, sadly.
[2022-12-31 03:43:30] <%$nemafow> I reckon ya'll just emotional babies
[2022-12-31 03:43:37] <%echomont> boruto is just a peace time og naruto

[2022-12-31 06:03:06] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> sadly, that can be due to how the state handles schooling too

[2022-12-31 06:03:33] <%Jaccquee> because I am not a confident person at all, but when I am able to share my emotions, that confidence grows even temporarily
[2022-12-31 06:03:36] <%$AbbyssalChimera> Attendance is bullshit

[2022-12-31 06:04:47] <%Jaccquee> honestly, that's the only reason why I was able to confess to my crush in the first place, cause I was riding on that confidence
[2022-12-31 06:04:51] <%UnH0lyHal0> I was gonna drop out but my guidance consular talked to me about alternative education and I started going to an All Day school. My senior year I got let outta school early because I completed all my classes and only had to stay for culinary arts
[2022-12-31 06:05:06] <%Diiiiiing> Still working on my MH, I ruminate A LOT. But, mindfulness techniques have helped. It's tough, but seems to help me when I get into a particularly doubtful depressing headspace.

[2022-12-31 09:44:56] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> throne is overcharging waaaay too much
[2022-12-31 09:45:01] <@%$SharkBiteREM> did you by chance purchase the smaller one

[2022-12-31 09:46:05] <!%willrob87> @darkraigefire that's what it said on throne 35 for item 50 to ship approx 10-15$ for taxes and fees
[2022-12-31 09:46:19] <!%CoopKaiju> I was gonna Throne it, but that shipping was wacky
[2022-12-31 09:46:23] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> yeah thats the point will those are way too high
[2022-12-31 09:46:46] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it's overcharging on those because people wont question it
[2022-12-31 09:47:07] <%$Chaostyrant87> arghhh i want to pay for things but a kangaroo has blocked me /flips table
[2022-12-31 09:47:13] <%$nemafow> Ok
[2022-12-31 09:47:16] <%$nemafow> So ironically
[2022-12-31 09:47:24] VIEWERS: 272
[2022-12-31 09:47:25] <%$nemafow> It cost me an extra $100 to order it for myself
[2022-12-31 09:47:25] <@%$SharkBiteREM> it's to discourage people from using links outside amazon
[2022-12-31 09:47:26] <%$nemafow> KEKW
[2022-12-31 09:47:32] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> i remember the cost of the plushie being more than I payed by a lot more than just "taxes" too
[2022-12-31 09:47:33] <!%willrob87> is it throne charing the shipping or is the other company setting the shipping fees
[2022-12-31 09:47:58] <%$nemafow> It was $185 USD for yours
[2022-12-31 09:48:00] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it has to be throne because egg just bought it from ikea for like 40
[2022-12-31 09:48:02] <%T0X1X_CAMPER> the microwave is on sale on amazon atm
[2022-12-31 09:48:11] <%$nemafow> Then $248 for moo cow
[2022-12-31 09:48:21] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> that might be because you're in aus tho
[2022-12-31 09:48:27] <@%$SharkBiteREM> the microwave was 299 on the link i posted, still shows as that on throne
[2022-12-31 09:48:39] <Burd_Man113> Lemme just test this…

[2022-12-31 09:48:58] <!%willrob87> @darkraigefire yeah but IKEA could be setting the shipping fee high to discourage using a 3rd party to purchase it
[2022-12-31 09:49:12] <%$Chaostyrant87> be funny to ship from au to us
[2022-12-31 09:49:14] <%$nemafow> Does yours come with shipping or not?
[2022-12-31 09:49:18] <%$nemafow> Or do you pay that seperately

[2022-12-31 09:58:21] <%iDeLaYeD_o> With Twitch you need to stream consistently and longer streams help, if you go on YT then you do short 1 hour streams
[2022-12-31 09:58:22] <@%$SharkBiteREM> Save with the intention of being able to play the most intense games, and have that be your goal. That way if streaming doesnt work out, you can still enjoy the victory of what you saved for
