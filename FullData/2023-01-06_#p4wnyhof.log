[2023-01-06 10:17:35] <%Bloodys> i dont like to bother the streamer bro.
[2023-01-06 10:18:01] <%Bloodys> @Slerus  ur welcome bro
[2023-01-06 10:18:18] <Thorlar> If a streamer didn't want to be bothered, they'd just not read chat or DM's by their own choice. insymNod

[2023-01-06 10:19:02] <%Bloodys> @Thorlar  i agree bro i dont mind anyone to ask me anything but i dont know the game at all or even the basics so i will be asking 1000 questions. better i learnt he basics alone then ask questions lmao
[2023-01-06 10:19:11] <DotScrypt> hydra
[2023-01-06 10:19:12] <%LordOverflow> hydra
[2023-01-06 10:19:13] <%+RoctarStarHawk> baron
[2023-01-06 10:19:23] <Kap0wl> you will sell the hydra anyway?
[2023-01-06 10:19:44] <DotScrypt> baron doesn’t get attacked anyways and probably is dead on attack even with +15/15
[2023-01-06 10:20:01] <Cringelwald> @bloodys we're always here to help you learn as well. Hearthstone BG might be overwhelming in first sight, so it's absolutely normal to ask stuff.
[2023-01-06 10:20:01] <Noradria> should look for birbs and reborns instead of buffing the minions i'd say
[2023-01-06 10:20:03] <%+RoctarStarHawk> @DotScrypt Zapp would still attack him
[2023-01-06 10:20:06] <DotScrypt> noooo bird needs to stay

[2023-01-06 10:20:19] <+sintech1349> Why do you always buy and than immediately sell minions?
[2023-01-06 10:20:26] <%Bloodys> @Cringelwald  appreciated bro

[2023-01-06 10:22:09] <%+RoctarStarHawk> @DotScrypt yes, now that the baron has 9 attack. the 1 attack stealth baron would have been attacked first.

[2023-01-06 11:37:37] <%+Its__Arkz> With Rafaam you should lvl first with 6 gold. Then you can level and hero power every turn. Just power level to the moon
[2023-01-06 11:38:28] <%+Its__Arkz> Yeah people play around your hero power just to stick it to you

[2023-01-06 13:32:55] <DotScrypt> I‘m going on a south africa safari trip in february and was thinking about getting the insta360
[2023-01-06 13:33:00] <%grimuletz> +get what you missed :D
[2023-01-06 13:33:25] <%grimuletz> best combo would be hero power on dozy + buy with gold the 2.2

[2023-01-06 13:33:59] <%grimuletz> that was the worst ahaha
[2023-01-06 13:34:01] <DotScrypt> but I‘m not sure if I should rather go for a camera that can give me zoom

[2023-01-06 13:34:41] <DotScrypt> @tactfulrager I‘ve seen a few reviews and they are mostly good
[2023-01-06 13:34:42] <%grimuletz> ah ok cool. waiting Q?
[2023-01-06 13:35:05] <%+TactfulRager> @DotScrypt But depends what you want to do. For a safari I would go for zoom over action camera
[2023-01-06 13:35:23] <%+TactfulRager> But if you're going to scuba dive or something, definitely get a waterproof action cam
[2023-01-06 13:35:34] VIEWERS: 603
[2023-01-06 13:36:02] <DotScrypt> no not going diving - but I‘m worried about weight if I take a camera with zoom
[2023-01-06 13:36:10] <%+Evewhiran> @DotScrypt For what it's worth - I use a goPRo for action shots and fun videos.  I use my phone for still shots.
[2023-01-06 13:36:15] <%grimuletz> level up

[2023-01-06 13:36:23] <%grimuletz> refreshes are better at higher tiers
[2023-01-06 13:36:29] <DotScrypt> I thought the 360 can give quite cool footage
[2023-01-06 13:36:40] <%grimuletz> you might get full tavern of same murloc (muscle one) and not enough gold to buy more than 3
[2023-01-06 13:36:57] <DotScrypt> @evewhiran yep that’s the setup I was thinking about
[2023-01-06 13:36:57] <%grimuletz> it has happened to me. while i was on dragons :D

[2023-01-06 13:40:10] <%+Evewhiran> @DotScrypt From a quick glance at comparisons between goPro and 360 - you are 'fine' going either way.  The goPro has smaller files if that is a concern
[2023-01-06 13:40:28] <%DrQSoul> yes

[2023-01-06 13:57:28] <%+RoctarStarHawk> @Mephist00 Hero selection is the most important and 2 instead of 4 to choice from is a deficit and you can only choose from 4 if you pay

[2023-01-06 14:01:20] <%SSJR0S3> guffs buddy gives additional stats with hero power or?

[2023-01-06 14:05:50] <%SSJR0S3> might be a option
[2023-01-06 14:06:14] <+TocoHungary> freeze for 1 star mech

[2023-01-06 14:07:52] <%+RoctarStarHawk> the taunt should have gone on the mantid?
[2023-01-06 14:08:34] <%+RoctarStarHawk> but the mantid gets taunt anyway and if it has already taunt then it gets additional +5/+5
[2023-01-06 14:08:41] <DotScrypt> taunted queen means chances to get divine shield are higher
[2023-01-06 14:09:01] <%LordOverflow> What does your buddy do?
[2023-01-06 14:09:10] <DotScrypt> isn’t it random @roctarstarhawk ?
[2023-01-06 14:09:10] <%SSJR0S3> is there a chance to get ur buddy back to ur hand?
