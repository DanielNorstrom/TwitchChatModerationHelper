[2022-12-28 14:44:28] <FillQMain> Statistically speaking, unless you're near the top of the ladder you'll probably win and lose 50% of the games you play regardless of skill level due to how League's skill-based matchmaking. While you shouldn't want to lose, dealing with loss in a constructive manner is very helpful

[2022-12-28 17:12:35] <StygianWarden0> All the tank items feel a little more even with each other,  unlike on release where hearsteel was broken and Jak'sho had to be flash buffed, then correspondingly nerfeded after Hearsteel's nerf when it became to strong.
