[2023-01-11 00:15:38] <%personomy> I feel it should be a rule, if you lose the 50/50 it should give you the element you wanted atleast. Like lost on Yoimiya get Diluc, lost on Shenhe get Qiqi
[2023-01-11 00:15:43] <momscurse> being in sschool forces u to have a good sleep
[2023-01-11 00:15:45] <Radix6561> also xinyan got dissed for being weak so all the "anti-meta" people built her

[2023-01-11 00:59:25] <%its_viviane> Hmm ig its a mutual understanding between both parties?
[2023-01-11 00:59:27] <%MigueC21> well maybe when one side is obsessive about the other?
[2023-01-11 00:59:49] <%its_viviane> HAHAHHA
[2023-01-11 00:59:53] <%pupplezz> Ayo
[2023-01-11 01:00:12] <aleksyqueen> yeah, but it's not always definitive. like people before becoming artists are consumers, right? and they can be fans of other artists even being artists themselves. so i think if you're not being weird you can get rid of the unbalanced dynamic
