[2022-12-30 23:03:50] <%+vannikxx> chat why are they going this way rather the next element?
[2022-12-30 23:04:08] <%+orald117> its a strat
[2022-12-30 23:04:15] <%Sparks4D> jesus!
[2022-12-30 23:04:19] <+Roids510> thats what im thinking
[2022-12-30 23:04:20] <%+orald117> the next elelment will have to be in circle so they wait unitl the end
[2022-12-30 23:04:28] <%+orald117> wow bad spelling
[2022-12-30 23:04:32] <%+J_Sturg0989> @vannikxx the first element is pretty central so they want to wait until circle is smaller so the next ones spawn closer. i think
[2022-12-30 23:04:42] <%+nexusxxiii> strategy, the elements can only spawn in the zone.
[2022-12-30 23:04:49] <%+orald117> basically they will wait so the next element is closer
