[2022-12-24 09:40:55] <+A_Shiny_Gengar> Drinking in public is legal in Singapore; however, consumption of alcohol in a public space or non-licensed premise is restricted from 10.30pm to 7am after the 2013 Little India riot.
[2022-12-24 09:40:55] <%Clickerist> Only after 1030pm, you can only consume it at bars/clubs or at home.

[2022-12-24 09:54:17] <b__hood> @drealselix oh i see but for that to happen temperature should go to sub zero right
[2022-12-24 09:54:19] <%$teamjetpoop> to permanently live in the tropics tho, means a lot of sun, so you have to become a lover of the sun, and you'll be quite tanned

[2022-12-24 15:23:03] <magnapuss> It's a natural reaction to different places that you're less likely to sleep fully to stay alert I'm sure...

[2022-12-24 15:25:10] <%ValentineDownBad> It's probably because those drinks are not strong enough for our resident alcoholic pepeLaugh
[2022-12-24 15:25:13] <!%Simonrpfan> But it does for dinner
[2022-12-24 15:25:23] <magnapuss> If you were more sure that you were safe, like with familiar people; you'd probably be more comfortable to sleep too
