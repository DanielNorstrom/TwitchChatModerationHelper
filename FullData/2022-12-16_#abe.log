[2022-12-16 00:44:45] <KiiWiiiii> otherwise, lvl 1 vault and go crazy on high level

[2022-12-16 02:13:13] <FlyingPhilly> nerf incoming
[2022-12-16 02:13:14] <%+bdpnguins> It’s because of the fast progression for your level

[2022-12-16 02:13:16] <berrden> maybe he thinks echo is too common?

[2022-12-16 02:24:59] <+carpeluna> I think botany pots are better for farms
[2022-12-16 02:25:21] <+Tattered_Steel> It isn't really broken and the only farms you can do is Carrots/potato/iron gol farm
[2022-12-16 02:25:29] <+carpeluna> ^
[2022-12-16 02:25:34] <%+bdpnguins> @kriptou21 not only that it’s just that tinted glass needs amethyst to craft

[2022-12-16 03:20:43] <+OutZeuS> nothing different imo
[2022-12-16 03:20:45] <%f0laaaaa> like zoom in to see the next room?
[2022-12-16 03:20:46] <%the_khaliah> I still don't get how the map thing was an exploit tbh
[2022-12-16 03:20:47] <KiiWiiiii> to look at other rooms ?
[2022-12-16 03:20:53] <%celinabena> zooming his pov isn't the same as making your map show more detail
[2022-12-16 03:20:56] <+mejeree> Seeing the map in the vault is much stronger than zooming in like optifine zoom
[2022-12-16 03:20:59] <+mejeree> WAY different
[2022-12-16 03:21:00] <%untruthfully> wait like optifine zoom?
[2022-12-16 03:21:08] <cavedwelling> it's a ridiculous comparison, your minimap can see 4 rooms you don't need to visit
[2022-12-16 03:21:12] <%celinabena> other people were using the map thing to see multiple rooms in the vault at the same time
[2022-12-16 03:21:12] VIEWERS: 1 042
[2022-12-16 03:21:15] <%+kyanshiba> when you expand your map it also shows more rooms
[2022-12-16 03:21:20] <cavedwelling> that is an insane statement
[2022-12-16 03:21:21] <%celinabena> so they knew not to go into rooms before they got to them
[2022-12-16 03:21:22] <%+kyanshiba> people were bugging it to show like both side rooms at the same time
[2022-12-16 03:21:26] <%untruthfully> yea the map can show u thru walls and show like dungeons and shit
[2022-12-16 03:21:29] <+carpeluna> There was a map exploit where you could see 9 rooms at a time
[2022-12-16 03:21:33] <KiiWiiiii> could you see 4 rooms though ??
[2022-12-16 03:21:35] <cavedwelling> he can't see anything he can't render
[2022-12-16 03:21:37] <%the_khaliah> I don't think he was seeing 4 rooms was he?
[2022-12-16 03:21:41] <%Reemikins> I agree so what if you see the room ahead 3 seconds sooner?
[2022-12-16 03:21:41] <cavedwelling> you can see rooms through walls
[2022-12-16 03:21:47] <%celinabena> like seeing 9 rooms at one time
[2022-12-16 03:21:50] <AnActualGarnish> the map just gets bigger
[2022-12-16 03:21:51] <kriptou21> @Abe if you change the scale of the mini map you can see 2 rooms ahaid
[2022-12-16 03:21:52] <%+kyanshiba> people were configuring it to see like 3-4 rooms at once
[2022-12-16 03:21:52] <%celinabena> zoom out really far
[2022-12-16 03:21:53] <%cullenn> they both enable you to "skip" rooms without going into them
[2022-12-16 03:21:59] <%whyu7x> abe can't see 4 rooms chat SMH
[2022-12-16 03:22:02] <cavedwelling> zoom on the minimap showed rooms through walls
[2022-12-16 03:22:03] <%+LaLaBriar> I dont think what you were doing was an exploit, but others were using it similarly but at a much higher scale
[2022-12-16 03:22:03] <cavedwelling> of course it did
[2022-12-16 03:22:09] <cavedwelling> it doesn't get bigger, it shows more space
[2022-12-16 03:22:17] <%f0laaaaa> you had to be like half through the hallway before you could see the next room
[2022-12-16 03:22:24] <kriptou21> yeh but you can see if you have omega or challenge rooms
[2022-12-16 03:22:24] <%the_khaliah> Abe's map thing just made his map bigger
[2022-12-16 03:22:30] <%celinabena> other people playing the pack, people NOT on VHSMP, were zooming out to see wayyyy more than she should
[2022-12-16 03:22:30] <cavedwelling> the minimap zoom shows more space
[2022-12-16 03:22:31] <%AmaraPeach> abe only see the paths
[2022-12-16 03:22:31] <mad_lantros_dane> @Abe  that is rubedium and rubedium Extra.  Rubi extra.  also lets you get light if you have torch in off hand !!!
[2022-12-16 03:22:34] <cavedwelling> no, it doesn't....
[2022-12-16 03:22:40] <cavedwelling> go back to your vods
[2022-12-16 03:22:40] <KiiWiiiii> from what i've seen from abes minimap zoom, he could see the next room at the entrance of a corridor..
[2022-12-16 03:22:41] <+carpeluna> There was an exploit you were not using but was the same mod. You could see 9 rooms at a time
[2022-12-16 03:22:43] <%+LaLaBriar> @celinabena this
[2022-12-16 03:22:44] <cavedwelling> you could see next rooms
[2022-12-16 03:22:56] <KiiWiiiii> its about the same as what iskall does inho
[2022-12-16 03:23:04] <+PlayerSBB> I always thought you just enlarged. The cheat is setting the zoom out and enlarge which I didn't think you did that

[2022-12-16 03:23:40] <%+sarcastic_minion> abe only saw the next room when he was halfway in the hallway
[2022-12-16 03:23:42] <frostydablowman1> i agree with u abe
[2022-12-16 03:23:42] <%$Tawnnie> Shirley
[2022-12-16 03:23:43] <KiiWiiiii> i think its about the same thing imho
[2022-12-16 03:23:46] <AnActualGarnish> i want what cavedwelling is smokin
[2022-12-16 03:23:46] <%+kyanshiba> im trying to find another clip from a different streamer, but people (not VHSMP) were doing like hella rooms at once
[2022-12-16 03:23:49] <%Beellzebubb> Where is wutax
[2022-12-16 03:23:51] <kriptou21> @Abe someone was using it to see 3-4 rooms ahaid (he didn't nerf it just cause you did it)
[2022-12-16 03:24:00] <cavedwelling> go back and look at your videos - you might think it didn't help you, but it shows MORE minimap, not just makes it bigger on your screen
[2022-12-16 03:24:05] <+carpeluna> Unfortunately the mod has a bad exploit that you did not use but forced VH to lock the size

[2022-12-16 03:24:19] <%$Tawnnie> baboFinger
[2022-12-16 03:24:19] <%celinabena> he knew about other people playing the pack too
[2022-12-16 03:24:23] <%celinabena> and using it
[2022-12-16 03:24:30] <%celinabena> he commented it on his stream at the time
[2022-12-16 03:24:37] <%+sarcastic_minion> are u sure he was not trolling u?
[2022-12-16 03:24:40] <%$Tawnnie> Well we stopped using all together anyway
[2022-12-16 03:24:41] <KiiWiiiii> if you zoom out the minimap more ( in settings) yeah, you can see more, but it wasnt what abe was doing
[2022-12-16 03:24:45] <%f0laaaaa> you basically had to be like 20 blocks away from the room before you could see the other room which i dont think waas that big of an advantage
[2022-12-16 03:24:47] <%AmaraPeach> is that person talking about that bug on the first day where the map showed the whole vault?? that was a bug and it was fixed

[2022-12-16 03:27:41] <kriptou21> @Abe imagine you can zoom 3x3 rooms is it broken or not?
[2022-12-16 03:27:42] <Unknown17z> Isnt zooming in just to look for dungeons?
[2022-12-16 03:27:42] <%Maiionaise> Ive been using that enlarge thing since last season and it just enlarges the minimap a lil bit and wont let you see another room when your in another room lol
[2022-12-16 03:27:42] <+allys1004> it's different but yeah it's still strong
[2022-12-16 03:27:53] <%+sarcastic_minion> u can do it to then?
[2022-12-16 03:27:56] <+carpeluna> He also watches deadpine and deadpine was seeing the 9 rooms at a time
[2022-12-16 03:28:19] <kriptou21> someone was using the tab like that so it needed to be nerfed
[2022-12-16 03:28:24] <%Reemikins> are they refunding your crystal

[2022-12-16 03:29:01] <%+kyanshiba> deadpine is a streamer who was one of the people who were having it show like both side rooms from the middle of a room,
[2022-12-16 03:29:02] <Unknown17z> Does a telescope allow you to see the next room?
