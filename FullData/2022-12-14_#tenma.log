[2022-12-14 13:42:16] <$Celador_Mythica> Anger can be beneficial. If used judiciously and not internalized it means that you don't tolerate things that are harmful to you and that you are passionate in protecting yourself and the ones that you love.

[2022-12-14 14:42:36] <Rainoor> No no I meant for myself, I wanted to do -a thing- for this
[2022-12-14 14:42:39] <Iridium_Knight> Its kinda like Dark Souls, if you can do you are allowed

[2022-12-14 14:43:14] <BeerDone> maybe you'd do a bit better if you stopped trying to fight with a fucking leaf.
[2022-12-14 14:43:16] <ertagon15> tbf this fight ain't fair one has a sword the other a literal leaf
[2022-12-14 14:43:21] <trinitrojack> wha hoohooo !!!
