[2023-01-05 06:04:57] <%Ishkagal> they banned someone they accused of doing ai art, when the person provided a WIP of it they basically said "your art is worse than ai art so its a waste of time" so i was pissed dnkSip and i called them out
[2023-01-05 06:05:20] <%Ishkagal> they banned me in 2 minutes after i messaged the mods lmao
[2023-01-05 06:06:10] <%xurxo__> reddit is kinda a shithole
[2023-01-05 06:06:32] <%xurxo__> anyone know what chase is gonna stream today?
[2023-01-05 06:06:36] <%$myndzi> wow that's trash
[2023-01-05 06:06:57] <%Scam_fan> @xurxo__ probably Terraria
[2023-01-05 06:07:08] <%Ishkagal> @myndzi the mods exact words were "ai can do in minutes what you do in hours so it's a waste"
[2023-01-05 06:07:16] <%Ishkagal> like nani the fuck lmao
[2023-01-05 06:07:23] <%HawkeyeTTV> shitty mods
[2023-01-05 06:07:25] <%$myndzi> wow, so don't use ai for art, but don't use non-ai for art?
[2023-01-05 06:07:28] <%ItsTheFrank> so they want AI art?
[2023-01-05 06:08:00] <%Ishkagal> i, too, am confused. cuz the dude has a portfolio going back to 2013, before this ai shit was happening.
[2023-01-05 06:09:23] <%Ishkagal> konoSip I also found out today why people hate boomerang spells. BibleThump I forgot and plasmad myself. betrayed by my boss killer
[2023-01-05 06:09:45] <%HawkeyeTTV> The only time I use boomerang is on a healing wand
[2023-01-05 06:10:17] <%xurxo__> wisps tho
[2023-01-05 06:10:30] <%HawkeyeTTV> I've never actually made a proper wisp setup
[2023-01-05 06:10:39] <%xurxo__> wisps are sick
[2023-01-05 06:10:53] <%Ishkagal> @HawkeyeTTV my favorite perk has always been boomerang cuz my first wins were with lum drill and boomerang

[2023-01-05 06:12:49] <%HawkeyeTTV> yeah I was almost taken out during a god run by a swapper who was sitting right beside a Polly mage
[2023-01-05 06:13:34] <%Ishkagal> my latest fun has been just trying to ABBC every run konoSip i realize this is not a good way to play the game but it makes it so much more fun
[2023-01-05 06:14:26] <%HawkeyeTTV> I usually just go ahead and do the bridge boss cheese, it makes the game go by so much faster
[2023-01-05 06:14:42] <%HawkeyeTTV> I've killed the bridge boss properly enough times
[2023-01-05 06:15:56] <%$myndzi> how is "sitting in one place and waiting for a long time" fun? ü§î
[2023-01-05 06:16:17] <%ItsTheFrank> you can do other things while it dies
[2023-01-05 06:16:27] <%Ishkagal> @myndzi konoSip oh I got a new catto for christmas and she likes using my hand as a pillow
[2023-01-05 06:16:38] <%Ishkagal> so having a broken wand is the only way i can beat noita regularly lmao

[2023-01-05 06:24:08] <%+WilliamFlagg> its a scam for sweat laundering
[2023-01-05 06:24:35] <%Ishkagal> ahh, i didn't realize the red bikini was a taxable income item. Susge
[2023-01-05 06:24:45] <%HawkeyeTTV> All those illegal sweat deposits got to get cleaned somehow
[2023-01-05 06:26:50] <%HawkeyeTTV> we should start betting sweat on what time we think he'll start
[2023-01-05 06:28:02] <%maghoy> maybe something like that will be possible once bot is always online
[2023-01-05 06:28:32] <%HawkeyeTTV> is that what he plans to do with 2.0? keep it on all the time?

[2023-01-05 06:36:21] <%$myndzi> @ItsTheFrank i don't know what this is in response to, but this is _not_ the plan
[2023-01-05 06:36:47] <%$myndzi> in the chat the other day i was describing some work i did in a previous effort, which i determined to be unsuitable and decided not to run with
[2023-01-05 06:37:51] <%Ishkagal> !citb
[2023-01-05 06:37:51] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks‚Ñ¢; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs
[2023-01-05 06:38:09] <%Ishkagal> that explains nothing. but neat
[2023-01-05 06:38:44] <%nolava> Hello sleep waiting room
[2023-01-05 06:38:50] <%$myndzi> citb = "chase in the bank"; a unit of channel currency you receive for getting 7 predictions correct in a row

[2023-01-05 06:39:56] <%nolava> HOPIUM nowadays surely myndzi especially from you!
[2023-01-05 06:40:18] <%Ishkagal> rambShrug guess i'll just hold on. no sound effect will ever top quack so no need for that.

[2023-01-05 06:48:46] <%HawkeyeTTV> tacocat is the best cat because it's a palindrome
[2023-01-05 06:50:29] <%nolava> Longcat gets my vote
[2023-01-05 06:50:32] <%HawkeyeTTV> also whoever came up with the word palindrome really should have named it something that's spelled the same way backwards
[2023-01-05 06:51:05] <%nolava> Palinilap
[2023-01-05 06:51:17] <%HawkeyeTTV> yeah something like that lol
[2023-01-05 06:51:34] <%ItsTheFrank> @nolava We should use this instead and hope it catches on!
[2023-01-05 06:51:45] <%SectionTIC> Anybody have a polydactyl cat? My little bro has a 5 toe. Wacky cats. Cats with thumb, the master race. LUL

You slowly float up to your X and Y rather than bouncing around trying to get the right number.  Once you hit your X and Y you cast your barrier and cast EoE.  It could save you a shit ton of time‚Ä¶

[2023-01-05 07:18:22] <%nouky_73> Hey Dunk, had this thought for your EoE spell to get a greater chest.  Not sure how well it will work but try casting Circle of Buoyancy on yourself.  You slowly float up to your X and Y rather than bouncing around trying to get the right number.  Once you hit your X and Y you cast your barrier and cast EoE.  It could save you a shit ton of time‚Ä¶

Crushing through Noita TI speedruns, he is legend we all know and love. But did you know about the legend's? small? feet? Respectfully he hides them off stream to not off put Chat with his adorable 4 inch toddler Air Jordans.

[2023-01-05 07:46:12] <%$myndzi> the biggest improvement to cosmetic layers should be the ability for a single cosmetic to have a mask and for "layers" to be more like a sandwich. so you can have a "hair" layer with a front and back, and a "hat" layer that is both in front of and behind the hair. and the hat can have a mask that crops out any hair that extends beyond it

[2023-01-05 08:09:01] <Oh910> no, you need obsidian to not burn to death
[2023-01-05 08:09:06] <%Naicii> the only reason you'd want it is later down the line when you need some bars to make nice weapons
[2023-01-05 08:09:08] <%hipifreq> yeah, meteorite is a brief stepping stone that can usually be skipped
[2023-01-05 08:09:09] <%Naicii> but it's waay later
[2023-01-05 08:09:25] <%Naicii> Meteorite is just worse than wearing jungle armor or a gemrobe

[2023-01-05 09:30:20] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks‚Ñ¢; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs

[2023-01-05 09:44:11] <%Naicii> Unless you are going to play summoner, don't bother doing anything with summon weapons. Calamity nerfs the effectiveness of summons when not holding a summoner weapon by 50%

[2023-01-05 10:08:38] <%truuuuuuck> I always think subathons are weird because it‚Äôs like ‚Äúhey we have a special event coming up where I want you to subscribe to me for my content, it‚Äôs called a subathon‚Äù and it‚Äôs like that‚Äôs literally the whole point of streaming in the first place
[2023-01-05 10:08:42] <%+Nootrishus> but it's OK, cuz they post the link and ask to like the video pepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 10:08:43] <%DarthJawa5> It's like the Truman Show but instead of following a normal guy you're watching the life of a goblin

[2023-01-05 10:09:31] <%truuuuuuck> Like the whole gif of streaming is already paying people for the stuff they do because you like it, labeling as a subathon is redundant
[2023-01-05 10:09:37] <%truuuuuuck> Game* not gif
[2023-01-05 10:09:38] <%+Nootrishus> Synnoc you can still see the reactions of chat which just serves to reinforce the behaviour (of chat and the streamer)
[2023-01-05 10:09:43] <mega_simp124> xqc be streaming more then he sees his family

[2023-01-05 10:09:53] <%+Tristan_Compton> i don't mind react content, and most streamers help give exposure to small creators, as long as the content is good of course

[2023-01-05 10:13:56] <%+Goninon> i moderate 4 channels and i have to admit, any channel under 200 viewers with any mods is just modchat and its kinda tough to get conversation or genuine interaction going.

[2023-01-05 10:30:52] <peterce3> Same
[2023-01-05 10:30:58] <+Dark_Styx> you should probably decide if you want to use summons, summons get debuffed if you hold a weapon of a different "class"
[2023-01-05 10:31:03] <%Letaali> I don't get scared like at all from games, but I recall my dreams vividly so I get nightmares, I would like to avoid them

[2023-01-05 10:31:06] <%J4k51996> @DunkOrSlam you cant consume more than 1 of the same adrenaline/rage damage buff things
[2023-01-05 10:31:06] <%Naicii> Unless you are going to play summoner, don't bother doing anything with summon weapons. Calamity nerfs the effectiveness of summons when not holding a summoner weapon by 50%
[2023-01-05 10:31:11] <%raimuxa> it took me 5 years to man up for alien isolation, it was locker simulator for first hours. 10/10

[2023-01-05 10:55:26] <majesticslothofdoom245> @DunkOrSlam flinx are more likely to spawn on blocks that aren't ice or snow, so you should mine a tunnel and put stone on the bottom.

[2023-01-05 10:59:46] <%+Blaumagier> @dunkorslam Mega Man Zero when? Even Britt already played it. you gonna let your brother disrespect you like that?
[2023-01-05 10:59:54] <%Naicii> Desert fossils is easiest
[2023-01-05 10:59:54] <Flupperich> Rubies directly
[2023-01-05 10:59:55] <%Pe4enie> ruby is the easiest, just go get it
[2023-01-05 11:00:03] <Flupperich> because you can see them with SPELUNKER POTION
[2023-01-05 11:00:03] <%Naicii> But rubies are easier to find
[2023-01-05 11:00:05] <Streak_Vo1d> @stellar_star_fall yeah. In vanilla you can dodge in 1/6 of attack, and no cooldown then. But Calamity makes it dodging in 90 seconds!!!
[2023-01-05 11:00:06] <WootHoop> Desert fossil if you use a spelunker potion
[2023-01-05 11:00:08] <%J4k51996> @DunkOrSlam planetoids in the space
[2023-01-05 11:00:12] <%+Blaumagier> he beat the first one already
[2023-01-05 11:00:18] <%+quail_says_hi> if you fall down your hellevator with a spelunker potion youll probably see at least one ruby
[2023-01-05 11:00:23] <%Naicii> @J4k51996 I second this
[2023-01-05 11:00:25] <Flupperich> Oh yeah, Calamity extra "sky islands" have tons of gems
[2023-01-05 11:00:27] VIEWERS: 532
[2023-01-05 11:00:31] <%Naicii> Get grav potions and search for them in space
[2023-01-05 11:00:41] <majesticslothofdoom245> @DunkOrSlam check if you have any geodes before you go mining

Using its more advanced aspects you can create huge storage systems capable of autocrafting anything you want and even interact with the crafting systems of other mods so you don't even have to do manual crafting in other mods
[2023-01-05 12:16:23] <%+quail_says_hi> you need to upgrade your biome blade to get the depths enchantment

[2023-01-05 12:19:25] <%+quail_says_hi> you dont exactly need them at the current moment
[2023-01-05 12:19:26] <%+PirateBadgers> @DunkOrSlam are you using the water breathing charms as well? they help with time in there cirAYAYA
[2023-01-05 12:19:36] <%rsPureHP> It's Orb in time CoolCat

[2023-01-05 12:19:44] <%+quail_says_hi> I mean the depths charm sorry
[2023-01-05 12:19:45] <%+PirateBadgers> oh you were cirOwO
[2023-01-05 12:19:49] <%Naicii> depths charm
[2023-01-05 12:19:58] <%+quail_says_hi> the strange orb is a light pet that ironically lights up the abyss
[2023-01-05 12:20:05] <%+quail_says_hi> but you didnt grab it in time
[2023-01-05 12:20:11] <%Loopyluke> you can fish for sulphur crates for depth charm
[2023-01-05 12:20:25] <%m3thew> look for the diving stuff in the inventory thing, every ingredient helps @DunkOrSlam
[2023-01-05 12:20:50] <+Synnoc> @Pe4enie yeah, you have to like that kind of thing. but standing in one place for four hours crafting things is pretty much my wheelhouse
[2023-01-05 12:20:54] <%+quail_says_hi> @Loopyluke fishing is for the most patient of terraria community lol

[2023-01-05 12:22:16] <%Loopyluke> @quail_says_hi fishing is a lot better in this mod cause of the boss that drops fishing equips

[2023-01-05 12:22:38] <+Synnoc> the convenience of pylons can't be understated
[2023-01-05 12:22:40] <%+quail_says_hi> @Loopyluke  oh no i know lol i love fishing personally but idk if dunk is the type
[2023-01-05 12:22:40] <%+PirateBadgers> it's certainly easier to set them up beforehand

[2023-01-05 12:26:02] <ArthurAshford> @DunkOrSlam for pylons, npc's need to be happy. That usually means preferred biome and not too many people around

[2023-01-05 12:29:36] <Flupperich> Specific NPCs only matter for the purpose of BUYING the Pylon
[2023-01-05 12:29:40] <%+quail_says_hi> for desert i would do arms dealer and i guess in this case nurse?
[2023-01-05 12:29:41] <%Naicii> dunk just doesnt have enough houses
[2023-01-05 12:29:43] <Flupperich> after that you can move any 2 NPCs close to use it
[2023-01-05 12:29:55] <%Naicii> just put the two best npcs together for all the pylons imho
[2023-01-05 12:30:00] <%Naicii> Then put rando npcs
[2023-01-05 12:30:04] <%Naicii> once you have the pylons

[2023-01-05 12:30:14] <Oh910> happy NPCs also give a discount, so it's a good idea to make the goblin happy
[2023-01-05 12:30:20] <%+quail_says_hi> @hamadouzko  thats why i just make npc prisons Sadge

[2023-01-05 12:31:47] <%asiexpect> yea have the houses floating so mobs won't get the npcs
[2023-01-05 12:31:53] <%Naicii> Stone can get corrupted

[2023-01-05 12:32:22] <Flupperich> so it doesn't matter

[2023-01-05 12:34:53] <%+quail_says_hi> its like instead of breaking altars you beat the mechanical bosses i think so beating the twins allows for like cobalt to spwan

[2023-01-05 12:44:27] <%+quail_says_hi> they actually nerfed it in 1.4

[2023-01-05 12:44:36] <%Naicii> It got nerfed in 1.4 yes

[2023-01-05 12:44:40] <Oh910> the reaver shark nerf was deserved

[2023-01-05 12:45:24] <Flupperich> also a fished up pickaxe allowed you to skip all early game progression by letting you mine hellstone from the start
[2023-01-05 12:45:28] <%+quail_says_hi> and you could fish for a pickaxe as strong as the hellstone pickaxe and you could fish for it on your first day
