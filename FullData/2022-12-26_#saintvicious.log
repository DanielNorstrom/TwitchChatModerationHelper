[2022-12-26 18:57:13] <%elvenmagician> duuuuuh what does outlier mean?
[2022-12-26 18:57:17] <GildedFool> people not doing the right thing, doesn't make it the wrong thing
[2022-12-26 18:57:22] <%+jaws98765> most people probably don't take stats in highschool
[2022-12-26 18:57:29] <%+jaws98765> and even less in university
[2022-12-26 18:57:41] <%+jaws98765> stats isn't considered core curriculum
[2022-12-26 18:57:50] <tryeu> isnt stadistic like the lastr part of maths that u never get to do beucase time?
[2022-12-26 18:57:51] <GildedFool> I ain't american saint :)
[2022-12-26 18:58:01] <%+jaws98765> true
[2022-12-26 18:58:04] <%StolenRecluse> stats is not core in my highschool
[2022-12-26 18:58:15] <+Quachoo> I took stats but it wasnt required to graduate
[2022-12-26 18:58:16] <Langoski> for HS standards, you need 3 math classes. only technical core for HS diploma is ALgebra 1
[2022-12-26 18:58:20] <+rdc30> I went to Andrew Tate's Hustler University
[2022-12-26 18:58:25] <Langoski> if you're gonna go to a 4 year college you need Alg 2
[2022-12-26 18:58:30] <%+jaws98765> I didn't have to take stats even getting phd in electrical engineering. I chose to but it wasn't required LUL
[2022-12-26 18:58:37] <+kylekong40> stats wasnt core in my high school either, most barely took alegbra 2 lol
[2022-12-26 18:58:44] <%StolenRecluse> there was AP stats but no one really took that
[2022-12-26 18:58:44] <+Ech0phantom> It's not about "people not doing the right thing doesn't make it the wrong thing" it's that the sample size telling you it's the right thing is suspect as fuck

[2022-12-26 18:59:14] <tryeu> i think i never had then  beucase no time for it
[2022-12-26 18:59:20] <kaziriz> yup, gaming is real world
[2022-12-26 18:59:26] <kaziriz> to us
[2022-12-26 18:59:27] <+Ech0phantom> Hypergeometric distribution gets used in poker all the time
[2022-12-26 18:59:28] <Langoski> I teach HS math. certified from 5th math to Calc 1
[2022-12-26 18:59:42] <+Ech0phantom> It's literally how winning odds for hands get calculated lol
[2022-12-26 18:59:46] <+WewtImaNinja> Stats and applied calculus were the only math I use
[2022-12-26 19:00:19] <liamgj> the only thing more enjoyable than stats was linear programming
[2022-12-26 19:00:29] <+Ech0phantom> Sure but I actually learned it for Magic: the Gathering
[2022-12-26 19:00:29] <+WewtImaNinja> Blackjack is a stats based game
[2022-12-26 19:00:32] <messymazz> Wait what
[2022-12-26 19:00:36] <+llano210> The way we teach math in the US is pretty bad. Really all anyone needs is basic Algebra concepts + gemetry + a little bit of trig as one class then a class of stats and they will be set for daily life. And of those these days stats is the most important tbh.
[2022-12-26 19:00:37] <+Ech0phantom> poker is just the one more people play

[2022-12-26 19:01:47] <messymazz> It's not true, you can't play like a solver.
[2022-12-26 19:01:54] <messymazz> And if you could, you would crush

[2022-12-26 19:02:24] <messymazz> Just because you know a few situations doesn't mean you can play like a solver

[2022-12-26 19:02:50] <+bustingcaps> alright, chat poker tourney
[2022-12-26 19:02:53] <liamgj> people will pick up if you're playing like a solver and it counts against you, because the table knows you're moves
[2022-12-26 19:02:54] <+WewtImaNinja> Most hands have a % of the time you’re meant to play as a solver and a % you’re supposed to play it off the table
[2022-12-26 19:02:57] <messymazz> Yes, it's solved. But you can't play it. It's to hard
[2022-12-26 19:02:57] <antiporter> it also plays 6 player poker

[2022-12-26 19:03:29] <Yelwah_> it doesnt play like a solved  because game theory exists
