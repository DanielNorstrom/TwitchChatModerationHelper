[2022-12-22 15:33:43] <%WaterIsHydrating> the issue with game design and suggesting ideas, is unless you have a very well thought of image of the game you are creating, you end up making a game where the world feels dead, the quests feel repetitive and the combat is shit
[2022-12-22 15:33:48] <%Flaskan123> you will never form a caravan

[2022-12-22 16:21:38] <%Flaskan123> makes more sense to be one handed if you are a legion

[2022-12-22 18:03:08] <%tuch501> During a recession, it is important to consider the potential risks and uncertainties in the market and to diversify your portfolio to manage those risks. Some investors may choose to invest in stocks that are considered to be more "recession-proof," such as those in essential industries or those with a history of steady returns during economic downturns.

[2022-12-22 18:10:29] <%+Jayjayblack01> Just think of Capitalism as a Ship that need coal and workers, you either can invest in coal(more Kapital) or food for your Crew(more pay for the workers) you always will go for the min max to keep the workers "happy" aka. not rebelling and the ship as much coal to move as fast as possible that your's always stays ahead of the mass. That's capitalism 101.
[2022-12-22 18:10:36] <Nackes> @TommyKayLIVE nah he is right. socialist states are worse than capitalist in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. like the ddr was to the brd

[2022-12-22 18:13:01] <%WaterIsHydrating> but ultimately are people going to want to do that shit if it means you can't buy a new phone or a steak at lunch? people can't fully comprehend the impact they have unfortunately
[2022-12-22 18:13:01] <%$RagnarFiske> @RagnarFiske i believe that there is a massive worker shortage in the US, especially in for an example resturant. there the amazon worker can make a living, sure for bad pay. but lets take a step back and imagine a world without capitalism the alternative is far worse than being forced to hold in pee.
[2022-12-22 18:13:02] <%leuchtiiii> The issue is that even eco friendly politicans will get corrupt and greedy

[2022-12-22 18:13:20] <%+sapodogger> Hi @TommyKayLIVE , it seems that most solutions to this issue involve more government. How do we reconcile that with significant corruption in government, see CDU or your example about regulators in Germany not tackling big companies?
[2022-12-22 18:13:22] <%eggman6999> A plague that’s wipes out humans is the only hope

[2022-12-22 18:13:31] <%deeezwalnuts> in order to fix climate change ia to find a way to create energy without damaging the enviroment...so we need to fund more in the research of fusion power...capitalism will not change its impossible ....changes in economy policies happen only with major events like rebelions @tommykaylive
[2022-12-22 18:13:32] <%Johnr_euw> i would prefer an AI overlord as oppose to the last 2 US presidents

[2022-12-22 18:14:19] <%julian_jrb> I think that most of the democratic institutions we have are flawed. There is just so much corruption in the world and so many little flaws with our governments that we can't possibly break out of this downward spiral.   So I too think that we need some kind of guide, you could say an emperor of mankind, who shows us the way into a better future. @TommyKayLIVE
