[2022-12-07 17:34:38] <+serabobble> Ya I didn't like the switch from Mech tactics to 3rd person shooter on the Front Mission franchise

[2022-12-07 17:35:12] <@%+Anubis169> what was that mexican gundam with the sombrero
[2022-12-07 17:35:29] <DyingcrazyA> I cant remember the name but I believe it was a Playstation exclusive where you build your own mech and fight against others. I know that's not much info but I don't remember the name
[2022-12-07 17:35:32] <+Rasolisu> Super Robot Wars 30 and Gundam G Generation Cross Rays are both on steam.  Cross Rays covers all the spin off gundam series.
[2022-12-07 17:35:32] <+FrankTinsley> Haha the racist gundams
[2022-12-07 17:35:38] <%Cormek> never heard of front mission before. apparently i missed out on a good game
[2022-12-07 17:35:42] <tonysome> lmao
[2022-12-07 17:35:51] <DyingcrazyA> yes!
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <Irish_Biker> Hawken?
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <@%+Anubis169> FrankTinsley: more a theme, but whatever

[2022-12-07 17:36:11] <Levitticuz> I've been watching duel gear, it's a mech xcom
[2022-12-07 17:36:15] <DyingcrazyA> yea I loved that game
[2022-12-07 17:36:33] <+garebare38> drill wand is best digging wand no doubt
[2022-12-07 17:36:53] <+garebare38> or drill spell I should say
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <%+J_Bo_> that wand always sucks
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <@%+Anubis169> drilling like "boop boop boop boop"
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <ThatLatvianGuy> did you have a poke at titanfall when it came out?
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <Laioken13> if they do make a new armored core i just hope they don't soulsify it
[2022-12-07 17:37:15] <%Cormek> just looked up armored core 4. I'm so going to find that game on ebay and buy it! thanks for the tip
[2022-12-07 17:37:29] <+garebare38> Titanfall was great
[2022-12-07 17:37:38] <+ChadWall> i only played titanfall 2 but it was a lot of fun
[2022-12-07 17:37:39] <%vixtlan> titanfall 2 sp campaign is good
[2022-12-07 17:37:39] <DyingcrazyA> titanfall is actually really fun. but died out really fast
[2022-12-07 17:37:51] <+microwave_brothr> welcome back to best game dawildPls
[2022-12-07 17:37:56] <%Line_Noise> Have you played Brigador MAN?
[2022-12-07 17:37:58] VIEWERS: 754
[2022-12-07 17:38:05] <%+Monster5234> incredible campaign and multiplayer and then they just died out of nowhere lol
[2022-12-07 17:38:24] <%ManCalledBrand> They didn't die, cheaters just ate them alive.
[2022-12-07 17:38:27] <%+blaudoge> did you play Vanquish? I remember playing it back then
[2022-12-07 17:38:29] <%Sadwikk> They moved to Aphex because they saw it as more marketable, then kind of shat on that game a while
[2022-12-07 17:38:31] <ミュウレ4242 (mule4242)> i vaguely recall an old princess raising simulator where you recruit mecha by dating them.
[2022-12-07 17:38:31] <DyingcrazyA> I tried to play Titanfall 2 this year and couldn't get an online game 🥺
[2022-12-07 17:38:49] <%$Untalented> I think they released Titanfall 2 one week after Battlefield 1, and one week after that was Call of Duty release. didn't pick the best time honestly
[2022-12-07 17:38:56] <Gorgetto> My love to Mech did start from "One Must Fall" and "MechCommander"
[2022-12-07 17:38:57] <%Line_Noise> It’s more mech themed shooter than mech game in the way you’re talking but it’s still good fun
[2022-12-07 17:38:58] <+ObeeJuan> titanfall 2 came back to life briefly when it was added to games with gold a while back
[2022-12-07 17:39:02] <%Line_Noise> Brigadier that is
[2022-12-07 17:39:24] <%+J_Bo_> what is your current favorite mech team in into the breach?
[2022-12-07 17:39:25] <%vixtlan> titanfall 2 is worth it just for single player. if its on sale
[2022-12-07 17:39:35] <@%+Anubis169> Gorgetto: One Must Fall 2097 :D
[2022-12-07 17:39:41] <@%+Anubis169> the career mode in that was wonderful
[2022-12-07 17:39:47] <@%+Anubis169> I used to play Flail
[2022-12-07 17:39:47] <%+J_Bo_> right on
[2022-12-07 17:39:58] VIEWERS: 754
[2022-12-07 17:40:18] <DyingcrazyA> @laioken13 they could easily keep Armored core as it was. maybe make a battle royal out of it. that's basically what online play was anyway
[2022-12-07 17:40:29] <%Versalit> Fuck yes for pinned messages, was on my fingertips to ask :)
[2022-12-07 17:40:29] <%Line_Noise> OMF I suspect had more style than substance if I went back to it but that music is already stuck in my head from the mention
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <%Ummon_> so much poison blood
[2022-12-07 17:40:42] <Gorgetto> Yes Anubis that was game what my cousin showed us when it did game out
[2022-12-07 17:41:58] VIEWERS: 854
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <@%+Anubis169> I tried playing it at some point last year and found that, like most games of the era, the game speed was tied to the CPU rate
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <%Line_Noise> I’m a little surprised there hasn’t been a mech version of War Thunder tbh.
[2022-12-07 17:42:35] <ThomasvstheDemiurge> Playing alongside you is so much fun
[2022-12-07 17:42:40] <@%+Anubis169> started it up and WHOAAA HYPERSPEEEEED!!!
[2022-12-07 17:42:43] <ThomasvstheDemiurge> fuck I love Noita
[2022-12-07 17:43:03] <+garebare38> man playing Noita just makes my work so much more enjoyable
[2022-12-07 17:43:08] <%$Untalented> accidents happen in the dark

[2022-12-07 17:43:58] <%AbstractPlay> Noita is an evergreen game
[2022-12-07 17:43:59] <Gorgetto> @Anubis169 i dont remember was it somekind emulator what you could use to play old games whit out tied cpu rate...
[2022-12-07 17:43:59] VIEWERS: 854
[2022-12-07 17:44:00] <+garebare38> Noitas just the perfect game to play anytime and just come back to
[2022-12-07 17:44:14] <%The_Worsti> But where is the fun if you see shit?
[2022-12-07 17:44:17] <ミュウレ4242 (mule4242)> drink the ocean. mine the earth's core. fuel your car w/ the sun.

[2022-12-07 17:45:19] <%Cormek> no.. not rise of the triads.. it was a different game.. lol.. rott was cool. anyhow it was a mech fighting game that got poor reviews
[2022-12-07 17:45:47] <%Line_Noise> Battledrome?
[2022-12-07 17:45:59] VIEWERS: 799

[2022-12-07 17:46:36] <%Cormek> @Anubis169  Rise Of The Robots. did you play it?
[2022-12-07 17:46:36] <@%+Anubis169> Cormek: Ludicrous Gibs!
[2022-12-07 17:46:57] <evil_din> Titanfall 2 is another ok mech game.fairly short, has a decent sotry and is a part of PS Plus afaik
[2022-12-07 17:47:02] <%Cormek> lol. i didn't understand that.. gibs? xP
[2022-12-07 17:47:35] <%Cormek> ah.. yeah, rott reference. lol. i'm not awake at all
[2022-12-07 17:47:37] <@%+Anubis169> in rise of the triad, any time you blew up an enemy, you'd sometimes get the line "Ludicrous Gibs!" meaning Gibblets, slang for guts
[2022-12-07 17:47:49] <%Cormek> i haven't played it in decades!
[2022-12-07 17:48:00] VIEWERS: 799
[2022-12-07 17:48:04] <@%+Anubis169> hence the slang "Gibbing an enemy" is to blow up an enemy in-game
[2022-12-07 17:48:17] <%Cormek> yeah,. i know the term gibbing :)
[2022-12-07 17:48:30] <@%+Anubis169> Giblets*
[2022-12-07 17:48:31] <@%+Anubis169> one B
[2022-12-07 17:49:10] <%AbstractPlay> Jibs or Gibs?
[2022-12-07 17:49:17] <%Cormek> that game was a blast to play! not to mention shadow warrior! you're half the man you used to be!

[2022-12-07 17:50:19] <%AbstractPlay> oh, I've always said Jiblets but I've also always said Gib NotLikeThis
[2022-12-07 17:50:20] <@%+Anubis169> and why not?
[2022-12-07 17:50:27] <Epiiis> TIL instagibbed comes from giblets
[2022-12-07 17:50:40] <%Cormek> wasn't sure people would get the term?:P
[2022-12-07 17:51:01] <%Cormek> were you into shadow warrior too,anubis?
[2022-12-07 17:51:05] <Uthybun> I think the average age of viewer here is old enough to know the term.
[2022-12-07 17:51:30] <%Cormek> yeah, i suppose you're right :)
[2022-12-07 17:51:37] <%sunny_snow> going to continue my god of war playthrough not sure why but hoping kratos fucks freya later all enjoy man

[2022-12-07 18:01:46] <DyingcrazyA> @patton2410 it really wasn't too balanced. but I enjoyed using different builds to challenge myself against everyone else who jumped on the bandwagon
[2022-12-07 18:01:53] <Epiiis> my first souls pvp experience was in demons souls someone used scraping spear to destroy all the durability in my gear and repairing that took souls worth of multiple level ups

[2022-12-07 18:03:47] <%AbstractPlay> I'm on my second attempt to replace the button with a better one. I killed the board on the first attempt and replaced it with a board that still had shit stock buttons. If it fails again then I'm looking at the 8 Bit Do Ultimate.

[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <@%+Anubis169> AbstractPlay: I can recommend the one that has the hall effect sensors
[2022-12-07 18:04:18] <@%+Anubis169> they're immune from drift
[2022-12-07 18:04:52] <%AbstractPlay> yeah the hall effect sensors and the back paddles attract me to it.
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <%AbstractPlay> but that shape though, why does it have to be so square

[2022-12-07 18:07:00] <%AbstractPlay> Guilkit would be the best controller option if it had back paddles.
