[2022-12-20 22:32:52] <~%AriannaFoxton> not actually random e_e

[2022-12-20 22:33:50] <%JustDodgeBro> musicmommyNoted
[2022-12-20 22:33:53] <%+RNGesusTTV> Its not true random and alot of people thing Spotify's algo is broken right now cause no matter the size of the playlisty, usually it will single out 15-20 songs that get played on repeat
[2022-12-20 22:33:56] <~%AriannaFoxton> its playing stuff that isnt wildly different

[2022-12-20 22:34:17] <pepsitasteslikesoap> its technically impossible to have a computer generate a number randomly

[2022-12-20 22:34:44] <@%Gibster99> Random shuffling is terrible
[2022-12-20 22:34:49] <@%Gibster99> Spotify has the data to prove it
[2022-12-20 22:34:53] <%+RNGesusTTV> ^true
[2022-12-20 22:34:58] <~%AriannaFoxton> yeah
[2022-12-20 22:35:01] <%pml103> some of the best computer rng is made with camera looking at lava lamp i think
[2022-12-20 22:35:06] <pepsitasteslikesoap> it has something to do with them needing somewhere to start from i think
[2022-12-20 22:35:10] <%+RNGesusTTV> ohhh yeah ive seen that

[2022-12-20 22:35:52] <%+RNGesusTTV> @pepsitasteslikesoap can you not just say start at 0 and end at whatever the number of songs the playlist is at, then just choose at random a number in the middle?

[2022-12-20 22:37:03] <%JustDodgeBro> you would need a formula to determine what the random number is... and that kind of runs contrary to what random is if you could write a formula for it. hope that makes sense

[2022-12-20 22:39:04] <~%AriannaFoxton> people don‚Äôt actually want random for shuffle
[2022-12-20 22:39:13] <@%Gibster99> Being truly random is pointless effort
[2022-12-20 22:39:23] <~%AriannaFoxton> yuh
[2022-12-20 22:39:25] <%JustDodgeBro> @pepsitasteslikesoap they used cryptographic random number generators for stuff like that, which use a seed as the basis for randomness, also gives them a way to check and verify the outcome
[2022-12-20 22:39:25] <@%Gibster99> Random kills the vibe with music
[2022-12-20 22:39:40] <%+RNGesusTTV> The ONLY thing I want Spotify to change, is how in my 200 song playlist, the same 15 songs are always coming up when I shuffle it.

[2022-12-20 22:44:57] <@%Gibster99> The queue is created once at the beginning

[2022-12-20 22:45:34] <@%Gibster99> So you don't listen to the same artist multiple times in a row
[2022-12-20 22:45:48] <%+RNGesusTTV> @Gibster99 ik it buffers a few songs ahead load wise, if the internet cuts out on data, i can listen to a few songs before it stops
[2022-12-20 22:46:03] VIEWERS: 127

[2022-12-20 22:46:48] <%+RNGesusTTV> i do that for most of my playlists but some i dont
[2022-12-20 22:47:11] <%+RNGesusTTV> @Gibster99 i think that was disproven, only used for building your reccomended playlists
[2022-12-20 22:47:28] <pepsitasteslikesoap> if ari suddenly went ded, i wonder how long it would take for one of us to notice she stopped chatting
[2022-12-20 22:47:30] <@%Gibster99> Spotify obviously has lots of backend data to know what matches best.
[2022-12-20 22:47:35] <%+RNGesusTTV> true
[2022-12-20 22:47:37] <@%Gibster99> Like the discovery algorithm is pretty cool.
[2022-12-20 22:47:49] <%+RNGesusTTV> agreed, my discovery playlist is always sick
[2022-12-20 22:47:52] <@%Gibster99> They sample users that listen to the same songs as you to suggest new ones.

[2022-12-20 22:48:19] <%+RNGesusTTV> Enhance is meh in my experience, but i like the concept
[2022-12-20 22:49:12] <%+RNGesusTTV> one thing that bothers me though, I wish it would purposely exclude songs i already have a certain amount of listens on already I occasionally get songs I already have saved or liked
[2022-12-20 22:49:18] <%+RNGesusTTV> on my discovery
[2022-12-20 22:49:30] <@%Gibster99> They want it to vibe tho
[2022-12-20 22:49:40] <@%Gibster99> So a mixture of what you're familiar with to keep you in
[2022-12-20 22:49:57] <%+RNGesusTTV> yeah, but if im trying to "discover" I dont want stuff I alrready know, yknow

[2022-12-20 23:00:17] <@%Gibster99> Sonic Profiles: Create a time frequency representation of every song on spotify to analyse (Frequency of frequencies on a time graph) pump it into a neural network to evaluate key, tempo, timbre, loudness, and time signature. Do this for song you do like and find songs you've never heard before. Add a bit of randomness into this or ignore some variables so it's not an echo chamber and that's it.
