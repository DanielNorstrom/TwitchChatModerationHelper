[2022-12-19 12:19:24] <%Dying_Sun_> Doom Blast is triggered when a hex ends, and its damage benefits from bonuses of the ending hex. E.g. the reduced chaos resistance from Despair.

[2022-12-19 14:06:35] <%Dying_Sun_> anomalous added chaos
[2022-12-19 14:06:46] <Ninjakens> Doom Blast is considered a spell, therefore modifiers to spell damage apply to it.  Doom Blast is triggered when a hex ends, and its damage benefits from bonuses of the ending hex. E.g. the reduced chaos resistance from Despair.
[2022-12-19 14:07:26] <Oiry> @Ninjakens But that's bad then, because you'd have to wait until your hex ends....?

[2022-12-19 14:14:36] <Chrooffer> so, Spell Cascade doesnt work for ID, but it Does for the Curse, so with overlap you can trigger 3 explosions per cast
[2022-12-19 14:14:48] <%+camdacop> you're at 12.54 doomblasts if all three cascades hit each time, which means half the blasts don't go off @nugiyen
[2022-12-19 14:14:53] <Chrooffer> = why power charge stacking occu is very good for getting 3 explosions per cast

[2022-12-19 14:31:53] <veenlijk> it was a lot more simple in the time of sunder being good
[2022-12-19 14:32:01] <Chrooffer> basically: if no CDR u can get 6 explosions per second (not counting the charges). If u overlap 2 cascades u max out at 0,33 cast per sec, for 3 cascades its at 0.5 cast per sec
[2022-12-19 14:32:07] <+Sadisticmgt> In beta it was pretty simple. Now there are 20 league mechanics to play around with, gems, clusters, etc.

[2022-12-19 15:11:11] <Chrooffer> 52% for second
[2022-12-19 15:11:36] <Chrooffer> so, Crafted CDR on belt + CDR jewel/cdr on boots
[2022-12-19 15:11:59] <Chrooffer> you can get 25% cdr on the new Curse Jewel, then 10-20 per boot + belt, so its doable, but prob not in SSF

[2022-12-19 15:25:06] <Chrooffer> cause you can trigger ID by overriding it with Vixen curses
[2022-12-19 15:25:19] <Chrooffer> ah yea, misheard sry
[2022-12-19 15:25:30] <Supabait> nah if you get a jewel like raiz has, the damage seems insane. the wither on hit jewel can make you get 14 wither stacks in one second

[2022-12-19 15:28:04] <Zayatani> the cursed ground + cascade setup is likke 1.7x the damage of fireball after adjusting for support gems and cast speed, definitely strong
[2022-12-19 15:28:11] <Supabait> in pob even with double cold iron point it struggles hitting 1 mil dps

[2022-12-19 15:29:46] <Chrooffer> (you just need to be freeze immune)

[2022-12-19 15:30:02] <Chrooffer> also true

[2022-12-19 15:30:43] <grumbira> this nodes TL:DR: get flame blast to 3sec (faster ignites) and just recurse the enemy all the time. no need for removing curse first, just recast it --> unlimited ignite duration :)

[2022-12-19 17:45:06] <SollSmottoh> Basically on fights that you need to dodge mechanics, temporal chains will be better because you make it easier due to the slow and you do more damage because of poison uptime

[2022-12-19 21:06:07] <nintendojuul> steel mentioned it earlier
[2022-12-19 21:06:10] <veenlijk> but its so expensive
[2022-12-19 21:06:33] <Eric0E> metamod is 5 blessed right?
[2022-12-19 21:06:45] <veenlijk> 2 extra divines if you hit it the first time. it can also anul the crafted mod
[2022-12-19 21:06:47] <Eric0E> nvm its 1 div
[2022-12-19 21:07:04] <veenlijk> you can still anul the crafted mod
[2022-12-19 21:07:19] <+sainisin> import the bow on craft of exile and play with it there
[2022-12-19 21:07:31] VIEWERS: 866
[2022-12-19 21:07:32] <+sainisin> before you do it in game
[2022-12-19 21:07:35] <kruderf> yeah craft of exile is the way to go
[2022-12-19 21:07:46] <%Vosy1984> worst case scenario you end up deleting some divines KEKLEO
[2022-12-19 21:07:50] <chriscool657> alright i do some testing on craft of exile, thanks everyone, new to crafting and just following ziz build tbh
[2022-12-19 21:08:01] <%MrAscar> He probably want to annul an attack mod so it's not worth it imo
[2022-12-19 21:08:10] <%MrAscar> not an attack mod
[2022-12-19 21:08:42] <%+baysyx> +2 bow is attack mod
[2022-12-19 21:08:49] <%+baysyx> +1to gems is not
[2022-12-19 21:08:49] <+sainisin> yes
[2022-12-19 21:09:01] <%MrAscar> oh my bad
[2022-12-19 21:09:03] <veenlijk> to be fair i think protecting +2 mod than annul until you hit the other prefix with the annul is the way to go
[2022-12-19 21:09:27] <+sainisin> i just started my bow but i am poor and no div :(
[2022-12-19 21:09:32] VIEWERS: 848
[2022-12-19 21:09:38] <+sainisin> to finish it
[2022-12-19 21:09:50] <Eric0E> Nvm, there is only 1 non-attack prefix and it's +1 gems. So this method doesn't work to get rid of prefixes, only suffix
[2022-12-19 21:09:54] <%+baysyx> As soon as u can complete the Sanctum ull swim in Divines.
[2022-12-19 21:09:54] <@%+DerangedM8> on bows yes
[2022-12-19 21:10:01] <@%+DerangedM8> always
[2022-12-19 21:10:20] <+sainisin> T1 attack on a hunter base
[2022-12-19 21:10:41] <!%Schlurpus> i settled for 16% ibnstead of 17-19%
[2022-12-19 21:10:44] <+DagroTV> yeah you want the +2, +1 and attack speed. the vision would be with elemental dmg and dmg over time too
[2022-12-19 21:10:54] <veenlijk> the atk speed makes it nice but i think dream bow has hunter prefix like pen
[2022-12-19 21:11:32] VIEWERS: 848
[2022-12-19 21:11:44] <+sainisin> mu bow is rare with no other mods
[2022-12-19 21:11:59] <veenlijk> if you have like 2 or 3 divines cause you might get unlucky
[2022-12-19 21:11:59] <chriscool657> yeah actually all the prefixes are attack so that method wouldn't help me
[2022-12-19 21:12:08] <chriscool657> guess its raw annul time
[2022-12-19 21:12:10] <EssPay> HUH
[2022-12-19 21:12:15] <+LepreChaunor> just found my hunter thicket and hit t1 attack speed with my first dread essence lol

[2022-12-19 21:14:30] <murd3r3r_> i see you hit T3 as well xD
[2022-12-19 21:14:32] <@%XaiTV> nah, not anymore I think
[2022-12-19 21:15:03] <veenlijk> the aislin or annul on multimod is another fancy uberswanky way to go

[2022-12-19 21:16:03] <+sainisin> yep
[2022-12-19 21:16:07] <@%XaiTV> you'd need to hit dot mult and attack speed though
[2022-12-19 21:16:13] <@%XaiTV> that's not really ssf realistic imo :P
[2022-12-19 21:16:13] <veenlijk> is the cant roll prefix scour thing still in the game?
[2022-12-19 21:16:24] <TUROK__> yeah prefix can't be changed
[2022-12-19 21:16:25] <TUROK__> scour
[2022-12-19 21:16:39] <@%XaiTV> +2 support is big too
[2022-12-19 21:16:46] <@%XaiTV> gives you some more %
[2022-12-19 21:17:04] <Virel360> @nugiyen +2 support with empower is massive

[2022-12-19 21:17:38] <@%XaiTV> it's the same as +2 bow for tr levels yeah
[2022-12-19 21:17:47] <+sainisin> so the second one will be better than the other one
[2022-12-19 21:17:58] <%+baysyx> Its like 2% more or so.
[2022-12-19 21:18:14] <%+baysyx> w/ a level 4 empower
[2022-12-19 21:18:26] <mukentukenz> prefix cannot be change stii exist?

[2022-12-19 21:18:44] <Eric0E> surely COPIUM
[2022-12-19 21:18:48] <veenlijk> that would be the next step for the bow in chat. prefix no change into scour
[2022-12-19 21:19:01] <Virel360> @nugiyen but +2 support with empower also gives your other supports +2 (minor i know but its still something) where as +2 bow is mainly just the main skill
