[2023-01-07 04:25:19] <%joe_nj> When I played Soccer in High School. My team got into a big fight with another HS team. One of my teammates is Albanian and he had his cousins at the game who may or may not have been in a gang and they rushed the field with pipes and I kinda stopped fighting this one player and dipped cause I didn't want to be charged with a crime

[2023-01-07 05:40:09] <+rusty_nl> if it makes you feel any better, I don't think I'd be doing any better either LUL games like this seem pretty rough
[2023-01-07 05:40:31] <%Dva1nz> I think there is a game similar to Tarkov style but in the future setting. I saw Shroud played it but too many cheaters because new FPS = more cheaters to break the game

[2023-01-07 07:30:07] <%Gallowloch> Casino bosses are trained to spot card counters
[2023-01-07 07:30:11] <%joe_nj> Card counting is technically legal though and not considered cheating I think
