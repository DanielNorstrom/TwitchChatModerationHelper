[2022-12-07 14:55:38] <@^Nightbot> Just like the moment you become a twitch stream you have given up on persuading a actual real real real career or doing something with actual meaning in your life to build for your long future or retirement and not hanging in from of a PC screen. Just my personal opinion

[2022-12-07 14:56:43] <@^Nightbot> Lol. I don't really care if it's not a good look. I don't really like ceremor. Or this community. Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

They fucking know we know, they know Ceremor knows, that's why they want him dead, like WTF wake up guys WAKE UP seriously fhey're just like crabpeople saying they don't bite but they actually just pour ink in their salads, their salads full of tears and blood and it's pretty fucking lame, it's lame.

Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

[2022-12-07 17:25:21] <bryter____layter> @causemosmvp It does
[2022-12-07 17:25:26] <+Boomer196> @yoked_aux no
[2022-12-07 17:25:28] <%+dacook1emonster> no
[2022-12-07 17:25:34] <1991cony1991> what makes the suit bad ? asking for a friend
[2022-12-07 17:25:35] <+usmarine272> do you bleed with the suit?
[2022-12-07 17:25:39] <+yoked_aux> Shit that’s op PepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:25:41] <+Genzmoe> peanut had one yesterday, said it protects against bleeding and broken legs. that's cool
[2022-12-07 17:25:44] <+TaylorNottz_> it has 35 slots it could be more op Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:25:48] <yaaaaaaaaaaaaaeaa> It should be like a jugg
[2022-12-07 17:25:56] VIEWERS: 811
[2022-12-07 17:25:59] <+Genzmoe> but yea if someone unloads an akm on you. You're screwed either way
[2022-12-07 17:26:26] <%$jshredd1n> 35 or 45 slots
[2022-12-07 17:26:28] <+Boomer196> 35
[2022-12-07 17:26:35] <ccristix> @Ceremor the suit is actually lame
[2022-12-07 17:26:36] <david44_4> 35 + belt with canteen pistol knife
[2022-12-07 17:26:38] <david44_4> its not bad
[2022-12-07 17:26:39] <%$jshredd1n> doesnt even fit full size rifle
[2022-12-07 17:26:55] <bryter____layter> Suits have their use. Not nice if u are a solo player tho
[2022-12-07 17:27:01] <+TaylorNottz_> i watched someone spawn in on 3 suits n kill them all with 1 drum mag ak barely op
[2022-12-07 17:27:08] <+Boomer196> and you can only carry 1 weapon on your back
[2022-12-07 17:27:11] <david44_4> i took a few bear hits managed to get my suit damaged but no bleeds :D
[2022-12-07 17:27:15] <bigc4_25> The suit would be better for pvp in vorkuta during storms that’s about it
[2022-12-07 17:27:15] <kattfilla> Does the suit allow u to explore Lantia more than before?
[2022-12-07 17:27:21] <thugg333> if you running solo
[2022-12-07 17:27:22] <pinktaco4lunch> you need a mule with the suit
[2022-12-07 17:27:23] <%animagus88> No backpack with the suit?
[2022-12-07 17:27:25] <+bantai> The only thing the suit is really stronger with is grenades and tubes. There you can def see a big difference. You can have a grenade land next to you and you get chunked but not killed.
[2022-12-07 17:27:30] <+Genzmoe> @kattfilla as long as you want
[2022-12-07 17:27:43] <+Boomer196> @TaylorNottz_ key there was he spawned in on them and they didnt see him
[2022-12-07 17:27:50] <dankNbeans> the suit was made for content creators

[2022-12-07 17:28:09] <david44_4> :D
[2022-12-07 17:28:13] <catzcatz> suit should have had 0 item slots but 12 gun slots like in half life
[2022-12-07 17:28:21] <OneAboveALL95> my double bullet blaze can deal with anything so
[2022-12-07 17:28:25] <+donnydurrr> I could see people saying it's worse because the flow of the map is off with people on the ice and spread out more looking for suit parts but doesn't seem like people are even doing that anymore
[2022-12-07 17:28:27] <jax617> Tf is a mouth breather
[2022-12-07 17:28:30] <%+itsAaMee> It's so OP, literally only the white alpha wolf has a chance to kill you. OR someone with Armour piercing rounds
[2022-12-07 17:28:34] <+TaylorNottz_> @Boomer196 i mean yeah but still LUL  moral of that story dont look down at radios in candycane
[2022-12-07 17:28:47] <bryter____layter> @jax617 The opposite of a nose breather
[2022-12-07 17:28:52] <%+MaXimuX_777> they should just remove shock damage when wearing suit. and add 20 slots
[2022-12-07 17:28:57] <rafakmado> @jax617 breathe only with your mouth and youll find out
[2022-12-07 17:29:23] <+Boomer196> @TaylorNottz_ yeah, that spawning in there has no defense but luck

[2022-12-07 17:34:15] <$hot_loads> all i'll say on the suit is i've seen Duke running about with it killing over 20 a stream easy
[2022-12-07 17:34:19] <$hot_loads> but then it's duke
[2022-12-07 17:34:21] <$hot_loads> he does that

[2022-12-07 17:34:42] <dankNbeans> @hot_loads he did that before the suit existed.
