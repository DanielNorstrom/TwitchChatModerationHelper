[2022-12-10 11:13:35] <%zealous_toaster> @longlivequebec they grey knights have a forgeworld that produces weapons and stuff just for them
[2022-12-10 11:13:37] <%+WingBreaker23> I Wish there was a codex or rules for the Blood ravens IN the SM codex

[2022-12-10 11:14:13] <corksulker> aren't tech marines necessary for dreadnought maintenance/operation? so if the grey knights have dreadnoughts, by extension should have tech marines? (correct me if i'm wrong)
[2022-12-10 11:14:26] <%ForkytheSquirrel> @corksulker that is my understanding
[2022-12-10 11:14:41] <DrongoDingo> I love how it's just some dude. the janotor didn't get off the warp pad in time and is now in the warzone @LongLiveQuebec

[2022-12-10 11:15:05] <%+MarkG2> @zealous_toaster I'm hoping their general release is going to be pretty early in the new year, I *need* those new tanks
[2022-12-10 11:15:22] <%+WingBreaker23> @corksulker They also craft weapons, do maintenance and Handle a LOT of maintenance, not dreads specifically

[2022-12-10 11:15:54] <%AlphaPrimaris> I think it works like a mobile turret? @longlivequebec

[2022-12-10 11:43:44] <svartknight> does the campaign immedietly fail if you fail this mission?
[2022-12-10 11:44:16] <%AikumaMatata> Did difficulty affect enemy count? If so, how many in this mission on normal difficulty?

[2022-12-10 11:45:34] <%Ashtaeroth> But honestly getting revived AND get the armor buff is just outright stupid and should be fixed
[2022-12-10 11:45:38] <%RatburgerFIN> i mean Que did activate 3 pods in one turn i think it was?

[2022-12-10 11:50:44] <%+stolid_winter> Regarding the dreadnought I found a post from the developers about it: Although the Venerable Dreadnought won't join you on all missions, Technophage Outbreak missions will be an option in every Bloom Spawn event after the 'Allies Under Siege' mission is completed. This means that after you acquire the Venerable Dreadnought, provided you keep the Venerable Dreadnought in good repair, you could unleash their wrath in each Bloom Spawn event alert (unless there's a more urgent target/story mission.

[2022-12-10 12:02:44] <dawnheta> I do think that on account of the fact that it's balanced with dreadnought in mind but the dreadnought isn't available for you yet. You can at least restart the mission.
[2022-12-10 12:02:46] <+myrakel> For a dreadnmaught you need a mortally injured Marine maybe thats the Idea ;)

[2022-12-10 12:03:44] <%JayJay1776> aye the spawns are messed up to be dealt with, without the Dreadnought...
[2022-12-10 12:03:48] <%AlphaPrimaris> You donâ€™t HAVE to do it now, right?
[2022-12-10 12:03:54] <!%Umlautt> @LongLiveQuebec what ive seen, its just really shit balancing from the devs
[2022-12-10 12:03:54] <Bogdanov89> choke points perhaps, only hope vs melee swarms. Dunno
[2022-12-10 12:04:09] <%ForkytheSquirrel> @AlphaPrimaris but it spreads the plague on the sector map
[2022-12-10 12:04:22] <DailyDefecation> the fact that even corpses getting back up get 5 armour is bullshit, on top of armour regen

[2022-12-10 12:04:24] <%ForkytheSquirrel> so not doing them screws with your main stuff as well
[2022-12-10 12:04:24] <%Ashtaeroth> Whatever you do now, both of will go down on next turn
[2022-12-10 12:04:40] <archie666> It feels either bugged or poor balance or faulty scaling
[2022-12-10 12:04:40] <@^Moobot> Remember to read the rules below the stream to avoid a *bonk* from the mods.
[2022-12-10 12:04:48] <@%+FreddieB2014> @alphaprimaris that's what I think too. It's OP right now, but later with better knights, better gear and your own dreadnought you'd have a better chance
[2022-12-10 12:04:55] <@%NLBladeNL> @Ashtaeroth The Emperor will honor your death
[2022-12-10 12:04:59] <%+stolid_winter> The developers have stated on a steam thread that the dreadnought is supposed to be available on any Technophage Outbreak mission @LongLiveQuebec I can link the thread if you want.
[2022-12-10 12:05:11] <%RatburgerFIN> oh hell
[2022-12-10 12:05:12] <%RatburgerFIN> :D
[2022-12-10 12:05:19] <%DrongoDingo> thats gg
[2022-12-10 12:05:23] <svartknight> oh my god
[2022-12-10 12:05:23] <+Aurofication> Oh what the hell?
[2022-12-10 12:05:25] <%AikumaMatata> Are you meant to do this mission now or should it be on the backburner until later?
[2022-12-10 12:05:25] <Cleric_Sunlight> That is way too many marines
[2022-12-10 12:05:26] <%Ashtaeroth> @NLBladeNL It's not really that, it's the fact that he will be unable to do any other missions with what marines he has left
[2022-12-10 12:05:27] <Kampfnudel34> @LongLiveQuebec How about something more relaxing? Choo Choo Charles is out ^__^
[2022-12-10 12:05:44] <+Aurofication> ANOTHER one? That's just unfair.
[2022-12-10 12:05:47] <dawnheta> So I went to chaosgate website and it said "Fallen Grey Knights can take up the mantle of Dreadnought pilot and fight on in the name of the Emperor."
[2022-12-10 12:05:48] <%ForkytheSquirrel> @NLBladeNL yea, this has kinda killed the entire run hasn't it...
[2022-12-10 12:05:56] <archie666> @stolid_winter nice that the playthrough is clearly bugged. That makes sense

[2022-12-10 12:07:54] <@%+FreddieB2014> No, I just think you took on the DLC missions too early
[2022-12-10 12:08:03] <muhanga> Or game expect minmaxing for some reason
[2022-12-10 12:08:25] VIEWERS: 512
[2022-12-10 12:08:26] <+Aurofication> It really does seem like these mission should not be unlocked yet
[2022-12-10 12:08:32] <Crossos98> even if he doesn't do dlc missions the bloom spreads
[2022-12-10 12:08:36] <%ZenythUltima> what happened? I just arrived
[2022-12-10 12:08:58] <%Ashtaeroth> So if the bloom spreads aswell, the dlc difficulty is just shit and unplayable

[2022-12-10 12:09:33] <%AlphaPrimaris> The mission I mean
[2022-12-10 12:09:34] <%AlphaPrimaris> Might have to pitch Kraskâ€™s spawning to the devs, or maybe this is the cause of all the negative reviews
[2022-12-10 12:09:39] <%ZenythUltima> oof
[2022-12-10 12:09:52] <Mistif_actuel> Did we lose anyone in that clusterfuck?

[2022-12-10 12:12:54] <%AlphaPrimaris> Yeah I think you activated the DLC stuff too early
[2022-12-10 12:13:04] <%AlphaPrimaris> And Krask not spawning isnâ€™t helping at ALL
[2022-12-10 12:13:14] <%AlphaPrimaris> Heâ€™s the crowd control you need
[2022-12-10 12:13:24] <%ZenythUltima> bug?
[2022-12-10 12:13:28] <Agentcrm> I would just restart the mission
[2022-12-10 12:13:29] <%ForkytheSquirrel> that seems bugged
[2022-12-10 12:13:33] <%AlphaPrimaris> And him not spawning just means it left you severely underpowered
[2022-12-10 12:13:46] <%ForkytheSquirrel> cos yea, were clearly two seed carriers in that mission
[2022-12-10 12:13:54] <%JayJay1776> I think it's bugged...
[2022-12-10 12:14:01] <%Ashtaeroth> I'd just shelf the game until a balance patch comes out. Unfortunately it's just bugged by the looks of it
[2022-12-10 12:14:01] <Cleric_Sunlight> that seems bugged
[2022-12-10 12:14:04] <%AlphaPrimaris> Yeah that might be it as well
[2022-12-10 12:14:06] <Agentcrm> * I would put this on hold till there's a patch
[2022-12-10 12:14:07] <silent_gommie> It does sound a bit buggy
[2022-12-10 12:14:15] <%DrongoDingo> @LongLiveQuebec time to get a refund on that dlc...
[2022-12-10 12:14:19] <@%+FreddieB2014> Reviews on Steam are saying the mission dreadnought is a bug @LongLiveQuebec

[2022-12-10 12:14:51] <%AlphaPrimaris> Unfortunate
[2022-12-10 12:14:55] <%+Aki_Valba> put it this way I think the devs will quickly look at this since it seems like its nuts
[2022-12-10 12:14:55] <%AlphaPrimaris> It was so good as well
[2022-12-10 12:15:03] <Agentcrm> Steam reviews are "Mostly negative"
[2022-12-10 12:15:11] <+aragonje> lower difficulty
[2022-12-10 12:15:15] <%AlphaPrimaris> @agentcrm and weâ€™re starting to see why
[2022-12-10 12:15:24] <%ShootMeDownDead> what happend?
[2022-12-10 12:15:30] <%AlphaPrimaris> @aragonje the difficulty isnâ€™t the problem

[2022-12-10 12:15:34] <%AlphaPrimaris> Regular vanilla missions are fine
[2022-12-10 12:15:39] <muhanga> review says that balance is wromg even if you disable dlc
[2022-12-10 12:15:40] <%AlphaPrimaris> Itâ€™s the DLC missions that are fucky

[2022-12-10 12:16:44] <%Ashtaeroth> @Cyart Maybe but you HAVE to do those because it spreads the bloom
[2022-12-10 12:16:46] <+FishAtHome> this, is what we in the business call "utter bullshit"
[2022-12-10 12:16:52] <dawnheta> Update 9 announcement only said it'll adress mainly game breaking bugs where the dreadnought missions are bugged. It said nothing about dreadnought not being available
[2022-12-10 12:16:59] <%ShootMeDownDead> @ShootMeDownDead id seen the dread' was just a marketing ploy, fucking hate the idea of, "there's this really cool thing which were gunna give you but only when we say its ok to use"
[2022-12-10 12:17:27] <Crossos98> if i remember correctly from your previous playthrough @longlivequebec , this+5 armor buff lasted one turn as well? or am i wrong
[2022-12-10 12:17:32] <%AlphaPrimaris> @dawnheta I think that counts as gamebreaking
[2022-12-10 12:17:35] <%RatburgerFIN> and the armor regenerated, and it was given to new units, which are both massive bullshit things
[2022-12-10 12:17:59] <dawnheta> @AlphaPrimaris It is. But at least the announcement didn't adress the issue, maybe it'll be fixed, maybe not.
[2022-12-10 12:18:10] <%+WingBreaker23> Q
[2022-12-10 12:18:12] <%ShootMeDownDead> what a shame i had high hopes for this game, glad i didnt get it in the end, hopefully rouge trader doesnt end up being a dumpster fire
