[2022-12-31 08:09:25] <%talon824> @golfrop A sub is a way of supporting a streamer, usually 5USD for access to their emotes and no ads. A gifted sun is a sub you buy for someone else, either personally, or a random giveaway

[2022-12-31 08:09:29] <%FehrTheTom> @Golfrop not sure if bait but if real, subbing for $5/month to a streamer gets you their emotes and makes the streams ad free. and obvs supports the streamer

[2022-12-31 08:39:23] <%talon824> Is Carnage the ability that gets wasted the most in this whole game? Coz it has to be melee Range, with a 1s windup that allows for suzu, tp, slide, roll, boop, sleep, death, etc. to rob you of it.
