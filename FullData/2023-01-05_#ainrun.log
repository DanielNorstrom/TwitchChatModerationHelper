[2023-01-05 09:08:27] <Keshgar> what's the"drift"?
[2023-01-05 09:08:33] <redmasbah> Can't hear the game btw
[2023-01-05 09:08:33] <!%oppai_o> game has no audio btw AMOKING
[2023-01-05 09:08:48] <CptCrunch_> @Keshgar Controller's sticks start to "drift"/move into directions without actually doing anything
[2023-01-05 09:08:53] <xbamxwaffles> stick drift i’m guessing your l3 and r3 move themselves
[2023-01-05 09:08:56] <actingvictor> drift is just when your joystick will not go back to centre
[2023-01-05 09:08:56] <%kashhie> its hard to sprint and turn camera at the same in controllers, i might just be bad
[2023-01-05 09:09:08] <lootgoblin95> its when your aim or walk joystick thinks its being angled when your not touching it "the drift"

[2023-01-05 14:06:51] <goldy_the_unbreakable> here's an idea, get in drag him to the start of the arena, and then run with torrent to the very top and then summon her
[2023-01-05 14:06:52] <jj_eyescrm> put her on the cliff behind her

[2023-01-05 14:07:22] <darkengard22> @Ainrun i think in the begining you have the agro so you can run with the giant far away buying time
[2023-01-05 14:07:23] <khalidseyadi> use that healing stone on her

[2023-01-05 14:09:28] <@%+ATONAT_> At least you’ll find the edge of her range like this and can keep him at max distance

[2023-01-05 14:10:31] <+KingLeon_VII> Maybe spawn her UP left of the entrance ? so it could be harder to the fire giant to go
[2023-01-05 14:10:41] <eladidu3> then tell us :)
[2023-01-05 14:10:46] <%+its_LDJ> Oh yeah, try shabriri

[2023-01-05 14:21:56] <!%oppai_o> no
[2023-01-05 14:21:58] <Mdp__pro> she's achamp
[2023-01-05 14:22:02] <+Tunercio_Ribagorda> maybe the banners could increase a bit summons power.

[2023-01-05 14:22:19] <%alo_obert> Fire Giant is the solidified Miyazaki's hate for meme runners in his games
[2023-01-05 14:22:33] <+dreman04> has he tried killing the giant before the giant kills him or latenna yet? Kappa
[2023-01-05 14:22:48] <+seedmole> thops's barrier EZ
[2023-01-05 14:22:58] <%why_damon> Hmm
[2023-01-05 14:22:59] <@%+ATONAT_> Latenna is like an infinite rot proc
[2023-01-05 14:23:07] <%LtMurloc> which is stupid, but we'll take it
[2023-01-05 14:23:07] <Mdp__pro> Thus far this is going decently Hmmge
[2023-01-05 14:23:08] <%3stefan01> RIP
[2023-01-05 14:23:18] <goldy_the_unbreakable> that spin move tho
[2023-01-05 14:23:23] <$realkarmaz> she actually good
[2023-01-05 14:23:38] <+seedmole> seems legit, if their preferred target is outside the range for any of their moves makes sense they'd pick a different target
[2023-01-05 14:23:39] <TyrannosaurusMaximus> She could move if she wanted to- she is just lazy
[2023-01-05 14:23:40] <Mdp__pro> the damage she does it actually pretty good
[2023-01-05 14:23:42] VIEWERS: 840
[2023-01-05 14:23:50] <Nekrazero> there is another archer too
[2023-01-05 14:23:51] <%LtMurloc> the real question is: will she lose aggro when phase 2 starts? Hmmge
[2023-01-05 14:23:59] <Nekrazero> the knight
[2023-01-05 14:24:01] <%alo_obert> She's Legolas the Albinauric

[2023-01-05 14:24:10] <goldy_the_unbreakable> his ranged damage ain't as good either
[2023-01-05 14:24:17] <+seedmole> i wonder how accurate the ancestral boi would be
[2023-01-05 14:24:18] <pvaia> she's doing so good tho
[2023-01-05 14:24:23] <Mdp__pro> hopefully the RNG will bless us elaBless Miyazaki pls

[2023-01-05 15:18:12] <%Tyykko> great heal is more fp efficient when healing summons, lord's heal has a 2.1 faith incant scaling for friendly units at 55 FP per cast while great heal has a 2.07 faith incant scaling for friendly units at 45FP per cast, is this small of an increase worth the fp loss
