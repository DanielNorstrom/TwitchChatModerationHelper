[2023-01-01 14:31:36] <@%Grimstab77> :o
[2023-01-01 14:31:36] <%rin_narumi> Nali do one scope shot and two no scope's and repeat that. it's probably most effective way to use Ashe.
[2023-01-01 14:31:44] <@%Borky97> bad nali we call this a warm up game

[2023-01-01 17:48:32] <NoneIsHer3> reccomend going for pharah
[2023-01-01 17:48:33] <%Nickgman101> pharah
[2023-01-01 17:48:36] <%night_wolfiez> whoever is dealing more dps lol

[2023-01-01 17:49:07] <808runn3r> Bruh LMAO
[2023-01-01 17:49:14] <itz_HLEL> Echo has more kills
[2023-01-01 17:49:20] <%night_wolfiez> considering you were dmg boosting pharah, echo definately doiing more
[2023-01-01 17:49:43] <%Nickgman101> pharah doesn't  have as much mobility as echo so she's easier for the enemy to hit her
[2023-01-01 17:49:50] <808runn3r> Pocket one until they get ult then pocket the other

[2023-01-01 17:53:19] <monica_duh> thanks that makes sense. that's my experience too
[2023-01-01 17:53:20] <808runn3r> Also make sure to callout any flanks to help your dps @monica_duh

[2023-01-01 17:53:56] <%+TacticalAleX> As a support its important to switch to counter stuff aswell

[2023-01-01 17:54:06] <monica_duh> the game should adjust how to evaluate a mercy for rank ups.
[2023-01-01 17:54:08] <%+TacticalAleX> Thats how i started ranking quite a bit, counter picking and knowing your limits
[2023-01-01 17:54:17] <%+TacticalAleX> Also happy new year!

[2023-01-01 17:55:16] <@%Grimstab77> XD
[2023-01-01 17:55:17] <808runn3r> Knowing when to engage and disengage from fights is a very useful skill
[2023-01-01 17:55:43] <%night_wolfiez> im so glad in understood that... if it was someone with no knowledge on overwatch, thats going to sound very wrong
[2023-01-01 17:55:44] <%+TacticalAleX> Yeah counter swapping is prob one of the more important things
[2023-01-01 17:55:45] <NoneIsHer3> good tip* learn to play with at least one character from every catagorie or be at least okay to contribute your team if you accidently role  queue on wrong one, or open queue! (dont ask how i know)
[2023-01-01 17:56:01] <@%Grimstab77> there's a lot of different skill in overwatch to learn and master. there's actually so much to learn that you should only focus on a few things
[2023-01-01 17:56:04] <@%+zyron999> The easiest way out of silver is pure mechanical skill, but it's not the only way. Knowing heroes, maps, and positioning can carry you very far.
[2023-01-01 17:56:34] <%+TacticalAleX> @Grimstab77 Yeah like dont try to learn everything at once xD
[2023-01-01 17:56:38] <%DrazeLakeR> does OW support cross platform?
[2023-01-01 17:56:42] <robinsrandomness> Yeah one of the main reasons why I barely play comp is because I can't play meta heroes very well 😅😅😅

[2023-01-01 17:57:28] <@%+zyron999> @sethya123 Depends on the rank, but Kiriko/Lucio were the goto picks in OWL
[2023-01-01 17:57:36] <%night_wolfiez> kiriko / lucio
[2023-01-01 17:57:41] <itz_HLEL> I think lucio mercy and kiriko
[2023-01-01 17:57:42] <%+TacticalAleX> Support meta rn is like kiriko, ana, lucio id say
[2023-01-01 17:57:43] <%Nickgman101> kiriko and lucio
[2023-01-01 17:57:44] <monica_duh> kiriko for sure
[2023-01-01 17:57:48] <+NyumoVT> Depnds on the tank what combo is best
[2023-01-01 17:57:49] <Meerrra> kiriko mercy lucio
[2023-01-01 17:57:50] <@%Grimstab77> Kiriko/Lucio are generally used
[2023-01-01 17:57:51] <+klism_> Kiriko mercy Lucio
[2023-01-01 17:57:52] <%+TacticalAleX> And some mercy if you have sojourn/ashe
[2023-01-01 17:57:54] <robinsrandomness> Maybe Kiriko
[2023-01-01 17:57:55] <@%Grimstab77> Mercy is really strong
[2023-01-01 17:57:57] <+NyumoVT> but Kiriko is a main stay right now
[2023-01-01 17:57:59] <maddeer122> jesus christ you are good at this game
[2023-01-01 17:58:03] <@%Grimstab77> Moira is strong
[2023-01-01 17:58:10] <808runn3r> It is good to play other roles so you know how they think and how you can adjust to their gameplay
[2023-01-01 17:58:18] <%night_wolfiez> mercy is mainly used for dmg boost i guess

[2023-01-01 17:58:39] <%+TacticalAleX> Mercy got better in the meta because of sojourn and ashe xD
[2023-01-01 17:58:42] <%Nickgman101> it's kiriko and lucio that are meta rn

[2023-01-01 18:55:21] <@%Grimstab77> Doing dmg as genji is harder than healing on mercy. But mercy movement vs genji's movement mercy is harder.

[2023-01-01 19:04:11] <%Nickgman101> that's unless you win like 7 games in a row perfect and get good stats
[2023-01-01 19:04:31] <%Nickgman101> that you might reach diamond 3
[2023-01-01 19:04:39] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea because you're playing with Syah, since she's not currently diamond you'll win less SR. Also jumping more than 2 divisions is almost impossible even with 7 wins unless you have SR buff at the start of the season.

[2023-01-01 19:06:07] <@%+zyron999> @Grimstab77 7 wins in a row could theoretically earn you up to 350 SR which is 3.5 ranks, so it's not impossible
[2023-01-01 19:06:09] <%$theconch_> did you had a nice celebration yesterday?
[2023-01-01 19:06:46] <%$theconch_> you're the sweetest foxplushyBlush
[2023-01-01 19:06:53] <@%Grimstab77> We have a hard time saying who's the sweetes between Nali', Conch and Syah. They're all adorable and such nice ppl to hang out with! nalithLove nalithBulgarian nalithBulgarian nalithBulgarian

[2023-01-01 19:07:48] <@%Grimstab77> @Grimstab77 SR per win was 24, 24x7 is 168^^
[2023-01-01 19:08:00] <+NyumoVT> you're all cuties
[2023-01-01 19:08:01] <@%Grimstab77> I'm not comparing Nali', I'm saying you're all really adorable.

[2023-01-01 19:08:21] <@%+zyron999> @YiHan You can gain up to 50 SR per win 50x7=350
[2023-01-01 19:08:35] <%Nickgman101> SR
[2023-01-01 19:08:52] <%+TacticalAleX> I kinda miss the SR system :(
[2023-01-01 19:08:54] <@%+zyron999> It exists, you just don't see it
[2023-01-01 19:08:56] <YiHan> @zyron999 thats just false, back in ow1 u'd get 25 max unless its a new account boost

[2023-01-01 19:09:05] <@%+zyron999> @YiHan it was 50
[2023-01-01 19:09:07] <@%Grimstab77> @zyron999 where do you get this 50SR. It's not possible to get 50SR unless you have SR buff from season's start
[2023-01-01 19:09:13] <YiHan> @zyron999 no it really wasnt
[2023-01-01 19:09:25] <itz_HLEL> "New game" = New ranked system
[2023-01-01 19:09:28] <YiHan> @Grimstab77 ur literally wrong and i havee played since beta
[2023-01-01 19:09:32] <@%+zyron999> @YiHan it's always be +/- up to 50 per match
[2023-01-01 19:09:32] <castiellx01> your character is very cute!
[2023-01-01 19:09:35] <Kruemmel95> Haha you like my math teacher: „what’s the result?“ „350“ „350 what? Apples? Eggs?…“ LUL
[2023-01-01 19:09:48] <YiHan> @zyron999 brother ur like bronze or a new player
[2023-01-01 19:09:50] <@%Grimstab77> @zyron999 it always has been around 24 per win ^^
[2023-01-01 19:10:50] <itz_HLEL> I thought you were acting like a math teacher

[2023-01-01 19:11:11] <YiHan> i'd never gotten/lost more than 30sr per win unless i was on a freshie
[2023-01-01 19:11:22] <YiHan> no one did
[2023-01-01 19:11:23] <%Nickgman101> MMR is just how they queue you and SR calculates your rank
[2023-01-01 19:11:24] <Kruemmel95> Do you know how much more power in maybe % mercy gives with her damage boost?
[2023-01-01 19:11:39] <@%Grimstab77> Zyron I'll DM you xD
[2023-01-01 19:11:40] <%Nickgman101> wait
[2023-01-01 19:11:59] <@%Grimstab77> MMR=SR
[2023-01-01 19:12:00] <@%+zyron999> @YiHan You just said 25 was the cap, now you're saying you got 30, which is it?
[2023-01-01 19:12:05] <@%+zyron999> @Grimstab77 No it isn;t
[2023-01-01 19:12:14] <itz_HLEL> @Kruemmel95 I think 30%
[2023-01-01 19:12:19] <@%+zyron999> MMR is the hidden match making rank, SR is your visible rank
[2023-01-01 19:12:20] <YiHan> @YiHan around 25 bro
[2023-01-01 19:12:29] <%Nickgman101> I thought it was 50%
[2023-01-01 19:12:36] <@%Grimstab77> @zyron999 that was in ow1, now SR is hidden and equal to MMR

[2023-01-01 19:12:52] <@%+zyron999> @Grimstab77 They announced it wasn't in the recent QA
[2023-01-01 19:12:53] <YiHan> @YiHan 30 is stretching it, i honestly dont remember even getting that much but its possible but 50??? LOL

[2023-01-01 19:13:36] <YiHan> @YiHan maybe google it real quick and show me the source since there isnt a single person who would get 50 unless on freshies or when ranking up after decay

[2023-01-01 19:13:48] <@%+zyron999> @YiHan 50 is the possible limit. Your anecdotal "I got X" isn't relevant

[2023-01-01 22:58:50] <+isabellathepancakee> yall, even if its only 1 state that still means abortion is illegal in ONE PART of the US so the statement "its illegal in the US" makes sense
[2023-01-01 22:58:57] <Astralmooncake> I like how you laugh at the matter when it's in fact really fcked up, not being able to decide if u want an abortion or not. So stupid
