[2023-01-01 13:46:40] <BoigBoi88> gonna be 5.0 by the time GTA 6 is useable
[2023-01-01 13:46:44] <boeiee> @Amandathecookie nah GTA online is huge

[2023-01-01 13:47:01] <%tenGreg> Imagine if GTA6 came with inbuild mod support COPIUM
[2023-01-01 13:47:04] <%huffa> 2 years or so, but from what i understand the framework was relatively the same
[2023-01-01 13:47:07] <pixalie> RedM is still in works tho, lots of shit you can't do in RedM
[2023-01-01 13:47:10] <@%Trubbel> @tenGreg LOL
[2023-01-01 13:47:14] <%thepsychoticbum> depends on the mod @uhSnow
[2023-01-01 13:47:18] <boeiee> @Amandathecookie i have no clue but its immensely popular and makes rockstar so much money
[2023-01-01 13:47:20] <+RBLive> theyre fighting people adding IRL brands into the game
[2023-01-01 13:47:25] <+RBLive> Like CocaCola etc
[2023-01-01 13:47:31] <%Albert_Fn_Wesker> wildRP is amazing
[2023-01-01 13:47:37] <%+Nicole> Some Rockstar devs have actually said that they enjoy the gta rp streams
[2023-01-01 13:47:37] <%+Jayc97> rockstar dont release on PC till a couple years after launch anyway
[2023-01-01 13:47:49] <%+TiltedTek> It was like a month after the PC release of RDR2 that RedM first came out. @uhSnow
[2023-01-01 13:47:50] <%BigBadBooty2> Sometimes mechanics makes people lazy
[2023-01-01 13:47:50] <+Zuggy> @TiltedTek It's going to depend if gta 6 uses the same engine as gta5/RDR2, Otherwise it'll take a long while
[2023-01-01 13:47:50] <%Stealthkillah122> @rblive yeah because copyright is  a thing
[2023-01-01 13:47:55] <!%Amandathecookie> when gta made openiv not work the whole steam gta reviews went negative KEKW
[2023-01-01 13:47:59] <BoigBoi88> mechanics add to the rp
[2023-01-01 13:48:00] <%+thejerrow> mechanics are there to help rp
[2023-01-01 13:48:00] <+mamba08242> Morning chat,Snow hope everyone having a wonderful year and best wishes.
[2023-01-01 13:48:05] <%Apitoxin11> What am I going to do if I don't have mechanics to control?!
[2023-01-01 13:48:09] <+RBLive> @Stealthkillah122 yeah thats what im saying
[2023-01-01 13:48:10] <OctaFlick07> Storyplay
[2023-01-01 13:48:13] <JamesF699_> mechanics aid more indepth role play
[2023-01-01 13:48:14] <%Albert_Fn_Wesker> roleplay comes from ppl who can create/want to roleplay
[2023-01-01 13:48:14] <%tehcreo> I remember RP with a sheet of paper and the theatre of the mind..

[2023-01-01 13:48:21] <stubbers92> Mechanics Aide Roleplay, They don't make it
[2023-01-01 13:48:22] <Merlin840> mechanics enhance roleplay
[2023-01-01 13:48:23] <SifuTrix> Acting/Roleplay is from the player not the game engine
[2023-01-01 13:48:25] <%Stealthkillah122> @rblive ohhhh gotcha
[2023-01-01 13:48:27] <+Delests> Mechanics are props for the RP
[2023-01-01 13:48:27] <%+Nicole> @albert_fn_wesker What did you get from Santa Claus? uhsHey
[2023-01-01 13:48:27] <The_Flying_Bun> mechanics enable roleplay, but roleplay does not depend on mechanics
[2023-01-01 13:48:28] <%+wozabekk> imagination emboldens rp more than mechanics
[2023-01-01 13:48:33] <DaSupaSimp> RP comes from the ability to produce a delivery
[2023-01-01 13:48:35] <%KND101> feel like once fivem gets gta6 the people who can rp with little mechanics will hop over and itll be a breath of fresh air

[2023-01-01 13:49:11] <%$LuckyPaddy> If there are no mechanics to enable roleplay, roleplayers can still "Create" situations.
[2023-01-01 13:49:12] <RJ_____________> Some of the best role play I’ve seen on the server was Aleks just faking phone calls in his tattoo shop as V
[2023-01-01 13:49:18] <vincent_075> basically leaving breadcrumbs

[2023-01-01 13:56:27] <%+Eddius89> thing is with roleplayers like Kyel and others they are able to adapt their RP to any situation so i dont think 6months would be a problem personally
[2023-01-01 13:56:29] <%+Coliveve> Short season prevnets long term burn and down time to do other shit in-between

[2023-01-01 13:56:37] <+ImmaHoodieNinja> and to add, 6 months is pretty decent amount of time for "slow burn"
[2023-01-01 13:56:43] <%Apitoxin11> Having somewhat of a timer on it would keep things from going on too long too.

[2023-01-01 15:31:18] <ghostechoe> @OkayRome That I had heard before, but curious more on how character death works, if it's still player decision or you're expected to perma if you get shot execution style or something

[2023-01-01 15:41:42] <%OkayRome> residential areas shouldnt have them, but shows etc are great
[2023-01-01 15:41:45] <Yomgie> fireworks are def not banned in the states
[2023-01-01 15:41:47] <%Morri89> @Bulfwyne each state has their own laws
[2023-01-01 15:41:48] <+jmsrbrts> @Bulfwyne They should, that's reckless endangerment and UUW
[2023-01-01 15:41:59] <%HeavyMetalKittenx> in my state we can’t buy fireworks  FireWorks
[2023-01-01 15:42:08] <%Morri89> yeah
[2023-01-01 15:42:11] <Nankuse> Its state by state.
[2023-01-01 15:42:14] <%GodIsD3AD762> after snow all the cars are white

[2023-01-01 15:42:17] <%Bulfwyne> @Morri89 NODDERS true, @jmsrbrts and deff, its dangerous with stray bullets monkaW
[2023-01-01 15:42:18] <Nankuse> My state you can buy whatever the hell you want.
[2023-01-01 15:42:21] <+sEn_SkynetsAI> back in the day my Big Brother collected 1 day after New Year all the trask for the powder played with it and then he lighted it on fire and lost all his hair in his fair and head xD
[2023-01-01 15:42:31] <+sEn_SkynetsAI> looked strange
[2023-01-01 15:42:32] <%Morri89> yeah banned in ny
[2023-01-01 15:42:32] <%drako5411> its realy city by city
[2023-01-01 15:42:32] <+sEn_SkynetsAI> xD
[2023-01-01 15:42:34] <CfWheezy> NY you cant even flush the toilet without permission LUL
[2023-01-01 15:42:35] <+Rummager12> Yeah, so we just drive across the river to buy them.
[2023-01-01 15:42:37] <Nankuse> NY has a very low tolerance for anyone having anything lol.
[2023-01-01 15:42:41] <%+doomjams> my county has a ban on anything that leaves the ground - people just go to the next county to buy them
[2023-01-01 15:42:44] <$Zumari_> doesnt matter people just go to another state where they arent, get them, and bring them back, the legal states start advertising right over the border LUL
[2023-01-01 15:42:46] <%+shayngry> Banned in the city I live in but they drive to the next to get them
[2023-01-01 15:42:47] <BlaqueFrost> some states ban them as they are fire hazards, not so good in dry deserts
[2023-01-01 15:42:50] <pxyeb> Snow manages to fly and do comms alone, insane.
[2023-01-01 15:42:51] <NohhMe> @uhSnow in Berlin they wanna ban the private use and only allow fireworks on specific public places where also PD and EMS are stationed then.
[2023-01-01 15:42:56] <+Sophytiia> I live in Texas - they are banned in the cities but that didn't stop people last night.
[2023-01-01 15:42:59] <%Koohoo207> Here in Finland we have two days when civilians can shoot Fireworks without a license. After that you have to ask police etc. if you can fire them.
[2023-01-01 15:43:06] <Yomgie> only mass has a full ban, other states differentiate aerial vs ground, consumer grade, etc
[2023-01-01 15:43:14] <%Dre_> it’s banned in NY but you can easily just go to NJ to get them
[2023-01-01 15:43:18] <%OkayRome> emergency resources, aswell as scaring animals, old people, people with ptsd etc just make it not worth imo
[2023-01-01 15:43:20] <%+phoenix_rised> @uhsnow in Pennsylvania, they have supermarkets that sell fuckton of all sorts of fireworks. but it's illegal to set one off in the state. lol
[2023-01-01 15:43:21] [Notification] Con_Jhena subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! [uhsHey]
[2023-01-01 15:43:25] <%Bulfwyne> @Sophytiia yea, People gonna do it regardless in the end, which sucks, but you just hope people are safe
[2023-01-01 15:43:26] <Psunamii> timmacWALK
[2023-01-01 15:43:27] <+MarkyGFunky> it's actual county by county. there are some counties in CA that either ban or allow personal fireworks.
[2023-01-01 15:43:28] <%+Saichen> in ohio you can buy, but you can't fire them off unless your local ordinance allows it. Ours says you can only on certain holidays.
[2023-01-01 15:43:33] <+Rekia87> Massachusetts they don't even want us having sparklers or the lame snakes

[2023-01-01 15:44:53] <%GodIsD3AD762> Croatia you can only use them between thw 27th and the 1st
[2023-01-01 15:44:59] <Sufficate> @Rolling_Thunder197 just age rule and you cant fire them in housed areas
[2023-01-01 15:45:01] <epiloguesound> @Rolling_Thunder197 In Sweden you need to apply before using fireworks. But everyone fires them anyway

[2023-01-01 16:30:07] <+CplDarkeye> song is Pick up the Pieces by Average White Band I believe?
[2023-01-01 16:30:16] <mikerno> they need to give the Air One a higher powered loud speaker. Would be so funny to be able to do stuff like the GTA 3 heli pilot.

[2023-01-01 17:43:27] <sworenes6> Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.

[2023-01-01 18:15:45] <%ZeroNeuro> they were going across the road, and stopped to not hit Mary
[2023-01-01 18:15:46] <CoCo11_> Looked semi legal
[2023-01-01 18:15:47] <%Boba_Nett> yeah stopped for the police so all good
[2023-01-01 18:15:48] <%+kittmitts> I think it was just unfortunate.
[2023-01-01 18:15:49] <Trivkz_> she just stopped in the middle
[2023-01-01 18:15:49] <+itswavyseal> That was awesome!
[2023-01-01 18:15:50] <+sc00basteve> Not legally, because a bunch of cars with their lights on we’re driving right towards her intersection
[2023-01-01 18:15:50] <%$Kilrathal> @uhSnow you mean "legally" like you did to that cop earlier in the mustang xD
[2023-01-01 18:15:51] <%Ilsted_> Legally dumb
[2023-01-01 18:15:52] <%+Nicole> She was driving with her buttcheeks
[2023-01-01 18:15:55] <%dantikks> looked legal but still shouldve seen all the cars
[2023-01-01 18:15:58] <%+Nicole> thats why
[2023-01-01 18:16:00] <FurryFailure> Personally if I saw cops flying past me I'd lock up
[2023-01-01 18:16:02] <zyga__> You stop when u see police lights
[2023-01-01 18:16:03] <+CplDarkeye> Deer NODDERS
[2023-01-01 18:16:04] <lukyas> Well they drove straight in front of a chase full of cop cars and stopped

[2023-01-01 18:16:06] <%+Laasor> It's not like you stop dead in an intersection irl tbh, u move the fk out of the way LUL
[2023-01-01 18:16:06] <tsuJin36> she kept driving I think, then stopped when you hit
[2023-01-01 18:16:07] <ChristinaTheD> does that car of her go over 35 tho? lmao
[2023-01-01 18:16:12] <%GopnikMedic> can confirm, people do that IRL to emergency vehicles constantly
[2023-01-01 18:16:12] <%evil_bullett> rabbit in the head lights thing
[2023-01-01 18:16:17] <jerabet> Isn't that the instinct, the thing you should do when you hear sirens?

[2023-01-01 19:19:42] <jerabet> How much was it before the changes?
[2023-01-01 19:19:54] <grant_eberly> thats in what, a week- 10 days?
[2023-01-01 19:20:00] <+hedeedinator> @jerabet thats additional 3.9
[2023-01-01 19:20:00] <%$Kilrathal> strike fees someone able to explain? like a tax on getting caught doing crime in your car?
[2023-01-01 19:20:06] <@%nnsLUL> uh hold on
[2023-01-01 19:20:08] <ArenaKrusher> @nnsLUL that almost sounds low to me, 1 chase where 4 cars got impounded was 500k+ alone LUL
[2023-01-01 19:20:12] <%+MUBS> tis cheaper to rent a H&O car and use it than to get your car impounded
[2023-01-01 19:20:29] <%$Kilrathal> ahh perfect thanks :)
[2023-01-01 19:20:33] <SwagnificentTG> H&O rentals are actually the play, which is why people are using those more
[2023-01-01 19:20:34] <+hedeedinator> ramee LUL
[2023-01-01 19:20:39] <+Metal8713> ramee was at 300k ish

[2023-01-01 19:20:45] <Revansoon> oop
[2023-01-01 19:20:48] <%Aeowynne> is that to push people to use their scratched car?
[2023-01-01 19:20:48] <hen_gedymdeith> Mickey was looking at how much it increased the State account
[2023-01-01 19:20:56] <%Uf0s8mycat> Time for a cheeky gamba before storm?
[2023-01-01 19:20:58] <jerabet> @jerabet Yeah I get it, but I wonder what's the difference between weekly average before and after changes.
[2023-01-01 19:21:00] <aluckynewb> its a good way to force vins to be used
[2023-01-01 19:21:00] <%+MUBS> i wish local cars werent shit so people would use them more
[2023-01-01 19:21:03] <Stanbroek> are upgraded local cars still a thing?
[2023-01-01 19:21:06] <anthonyg729> think it was arnie that had one at 400k. he just didnt get it right away
[2023-01-01 19:21:11] <@%nnsLUL> so before the changes on avg per day people paid around 90 ish thousand to get their cars out of impound
[2023-01-01 19:21:11] <Goldflux> p sure one of mary's was 88k recently

[2023-01-01 19:21:33] <Stanbroek> sounds like the play then
[2023-01-01 19:21:33] <jerabet> @nnsLUL THanks, that's  anice statistic.
[2023-01-01 19:21:33] <%+MUBS> people should use more VIN scratches since its a lot easier now
[2023-01-01 19:21:35] <jerseys106> has there been more shootouts at impound lot?
[2023-01-01 19:21:48] <+McCape7> Average 280k? KEKW
