[2022-12-12 20:41:01] <%bobinsson> it loks like raw makes the weapon base damage stringer, while regular makes it scale with your stats

[2022-12-12 20:41:30] <%Alno_> yes
[2022-12-12 20:41:36] <%Alno_> when your stats are high
[2022-12-12 20:41:40] <%justagummi> yep which means you'll do more damage than with raw
