[2022-12-18 05:55:09] <!%willrob87> I think so
[2022-12-18 05:55:13] <%$AmusedBenga1> But not sure what the difference between that and the 3080/90 TI is.
[2022-12-18 05:55:26] <!%willrob87> not a normal Egg sound

[2022-12-18 05:56:32] <%$AmusedBenga1> @SharkBiteREM The biggest difference I do see. Is that the 3090 TI is 24gb and the 6950 XT is 16gb.

[2022-12-18 05:58:33] <%$AmusedBenga1> @SharkBiteREM TBH I don't even know what ray tracing does for performance. And I have no Idea how to optimize the PC. I literally only built it and have done minimal graphic tweaks
[2022-12-18 05:58:34] <@%$SharkBiteREM> @AmusedBenga1 if you can find it at AMD's MSRP, i'd say do the extra 150 for the 7900xtx

[2022-12-18 07:01:55] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> The biggest myth around this topic is that the ability of rolling your R's genetic. In fact, alveolar trill is a skill that can be acquired through practicing
[2022-12-18 07:01:57] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it is not

[2022-12-18 07:02:53] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> now genetics can probably make you more predisposed to being able to WITHOUT practice

[2022-12-18 08:07:44] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> Benadryl and alcohol are both CNS depressants. These are drugs that slow down your CNS. Taking them together is dangerous because they can slow down your CNS too much. This can cause drowsiness, sedation, and trouble doing physical and mental tasks that require alertness.
[2022-12-18 08:07:47] <!%+baddaboom_> it was revealed to me in a dream

[2022-12-18 08:15:43] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> in the grand scale of things, adderall is a MUCH stronger CNS depressant, a few beers and a benadryl is nothing compared to that, and while I's good to be careful

[2022-12-18 08:19:37] <%$Jaccquee> but for acute illness, alcohol and benedryl would be worse, at least from what I know
