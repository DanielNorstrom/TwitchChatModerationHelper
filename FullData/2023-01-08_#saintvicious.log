[2023-01-08 05:32:05] <WFSUnotorious> yeah, you could def word it well
[2023-01-08 05:32:09] <%robotSabotage> you can't be like "hey lets work out so you can get a thick ass"
[2023-01-08 05:32:13] <%robotSabotage> TRUE

[2023-01-08 05:32:37] <%+jaws98765> something along the lines of "I go to the gym x times, would you be interested in going?" it's not that hard tbh
[2023-01-08 05:32:38] <@%Hoodedwoman> I'd enjoy to spend more time with you, want to start joining me at the gym?
[2023-01-08 05:32:49] <+Kage521> i mean you could just ask her to workout with you to spend more time together

[2023-01-08 05:33:10] <%+jaws98765> or like make it something that's not just the gym, do like a physical activity that's a "date" like rock climbing gym or something

[2023-01-08 07:03:30] <whiteseal45> I feel like most people you go up to and say "Hey I'd prefer your ass looks like this" would probably response poorly
[2023-01-08 07:03:38] <@%+wilsonao> everyone is sick rn
[2023-01-08 07:03:39] <@%Adventureness> possibly
[2023-01-08 07:03:44] <@%+wilsonao> Tell her it was the meds

[2023-01-08 07:04:00] <@%Adventureness> i mean she kinda baited you
[2023-01-08 07:04:02] <%+QuailmanTV> Ask her what she wants from you at this point.
[2023-01-08 07:04:04] <@%Adventureness> i feel like its on her
[2023-01-08 07:04:05] <+MRxKOOLGUY> I don’t even think long relationship stop caring I think it’s more the other person can understand you more about what you actually meant by something or you wouldn’t hurt them on purpose
[2023-01-08 07:04:07] <%+Magister187> you were on ambien
[2023-01-08 07:04:13] <%+kamikazi_34> the voices told me it was a good idea to say

[2023-01-08 07:04:18] <GenericGuy2G> @wilsonao True. I've got respiratory shit, buddy of mine just got over pneumonia
[2023-01-08 07:04:18] <@%Adventureness> based off what you're saying atleast
[2023-01-08 07:04:33] <@%Adventureness> lol 4 heart
[2023-01-08 07:04:37] <%+QuailmanTV> That's always worked for me. If my SO is mad at something, I ask them what they're looking for now in a perfect world. Usually makes them realize they're more angry than they should be.
[2023-01-08 07:04:45] <@%+wilsonao> If it works, it works. Partners gotta be able to accept an apology if it's like a real apology

[2023-01-08 07:09:44] <@%+wilsonao> I think I had a good dozen of these kinds of false start relationships dating in my 30s before I met my wife but I am also a huge idiot
[2023-01-08 07:09:45] <@%Adventureness> @Sburnett0624 yes

[2023-01-08 07:11:16] VIEWERS: 346
[2023-01-08 07:11:29] <+TheSlowKnife> yeah, I think just apologize and give space, wait like 1-3 days
[2023-01-08 07:11:39] <@%Adventureness> and you literally prefaced it by saying she's really pretty so.
[2023-01-08 07:11:54] <%Louisthexv> going non-verbal pretty immature tho TBH
[2023-01-08 07:11:59] <+MRxKOOLGUY> Also depends on the girl, probably a big insecurity for her
[2023-01-08 07:12:10] <406LoL> @louisthexv Yeah, I was gonna say something like that
[2023-01-08 07:12:12] <%Louisthexv> like how old are we just talk the shit out
[2023-01-08 07:12:16] <@%Adventureness> @MRxKOOLGUY that was like my thought honestly
[2023-01-08 07:12:26] <+Sburnett0624> The ignore game is pretty immature.
[2023-01-08 07:12:33] <%+QuailmanTV> wait, weren't you talking about how she mentioned she likes big shoulders awhile ago and that you were going to start working on that in the gym?
[2023-01-08 07:12:40] <@%Adventureness> she sounds insecure or had some past trauma with it, but idk i can be wrong
[2023-01-08 07:12:44] <BumperPool> yeah age and maturity don't correlate the way you think
[2023-01-08 07:12:52] <+papapover> Its hard to know what she heard tho....might have missed some of what you said if she was caught off guard. You've apologized so space and time and then it is what it is.
[2023-01-08 07:12:54] <+TheSlowKnife> eh, some people need space to figure out how much of their feeling is valid vs how much of it is react from hurt, and going no talk for a day or so while they figure it out is alright
