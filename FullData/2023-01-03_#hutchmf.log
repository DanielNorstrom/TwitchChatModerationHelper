[2023-01-03 02:16:52] <+sparkski1> Sum sums torso was blackened really early that raid , would that make a difference @hutchmf
[2023-01-03 02:16:52] <%GuvNaylor> someone needs to tell summit to do some night raids abit slower paced hes RAGING hahaaha
[2023-01-03 02:16:53] <+delafunkkkk> 3k hours but ok
[2023-01-03 02:16:56] <slaysalldays> @delafunkkkk so is every other game... that is literally a game

[2023-01-03 02:17:04] <jAmzye> @jumbylol its pretty bad from time to time, but you can play around it easily if you know how
[2023-01-03 02:17:05] <@%^StreamElements> Keep up with Hutch when he isn't streaming with his Twitter: https://twitter.com/HutchMF
[2023-01-03 02:17:08] <smooshpig> @smooshpig accepting it and saying ggs is tarkovs communities problem. its actually dogshit and needs to be fixed but ppl just say ggs and do another raid lmfao
[2023-01-03 02:17:11] <+jtwhitaker> When gaming is your job and you do it all the time probably makes it much easier to get frustrated
[2023-01-03 02:17:17] <bfaders> @delafunkkkk sumSuh sumSuh sumSuh
[2023-01-03 02:17:21] <+delafunkkkk> its not even the main point @StayHomeDadz
[2023-01-03 02:17:23] <%Indurence_> to say its a bad game just isnt true haha only few thing make it bad
[2023-01-03 02:17:34] <yno7_> @jAmzye yup. hes just rusty and inexperienced.

[2023-01-03 02:19:10] <%itsgolfman> @xxthebaintrainxx too much focus required
[2023-01-03 02:19:14] <nati04x> Dark and darker will kill tarkov if the devs dont screw it up
[2023-01-03 02:19:17] <+delafunkkkk> @lil_izy69 once again he gave me the choice of gta or tarkov id rather play neither gta both are bad games atleast gta has a fun single player
[2023-01-03 02:19:20] <bfaders> Wish he would play long enough to get the good gear he’s playing with a base shotgun…….
[2023-01-03 02:19:23] <%Bailz94> alot of people are enjoying it rn.. just not sum and his chat it seems
[2023-01-03 02:19:25] <+TeflarKevlon> @hutchmf did you find a nice engagement ring while you went and run errands?
[2023-01-03 02:19:25] <%ziffy20> @Gunete45 then he'd just bitch that you can't teleport with raw metals lol

[2023-01-03 02:19:37] <%+StayHomeDadz> in the last 6 wipes i havent ran a single raid with anything other than a glock. Ever since i started doing this, my happiness in tarkov is way higher lol

[2023-01-03 02:19:55] <+grubbers4> I just said ‘you were holding ADS in the open’ and got called out by Summit and banned lol. Literally the worst timing for any comment
[2023-01-03 02:20:01] <dnemob> i have 3.3k hours and i love the game. its all about mindset
[2023-01-03 02:20:03] <jAmzye> well thats tarkov for ya, the lows or low, the highs are high

[2023-01-03 02:20:05] <%Bailz94> @nati04x bro it's completely different game and dark n darker is like playing in slow motion...
[2023-01-03 02:20:05] <Barrettaa> i think bear starting guns are better personally

[2023-01-03 02:23:39] <%+RedxCobra> idk why he loves interchange so much that map scares the shit out of me
[2023-01-03 02:23:41] <%$darozay> he did last awhile
[2023-01-03 02:23:43] <%Bailz94> also sitting in a corner scared for his life didn't help his play there. sitting on bodies
[2023-01-03 02:23:48] <bfaders> I think the chat pissed him off more then the actual death
[2023-01-03 02:23:56] <%$darozay> feels like it was only 2 days 2 wipes ago

[2023-01-03 02:24:15] <%ziffy20> i found hutch through summit, huge summit fan, but man although the rants are entertaining they can be heart breaking when it's towards something you were looking forward to him enjoying

[2023-01-03 02:25:17] <%ziffy20> @RisingRain it's that drive that got him pro in the first place, dude hates losing

[2023-01-03 02:48:29] <Nooonotreally> summit is getting dicked down by tarkov lol

[2023-01-03 02:50:15] <%MrZomb1es> Now i see why u didnt propose yet lmfao

[2023-01-03 02:58:36] <%Baeltox> @XCmitchy 90% of the time game is fine, sometimes you see people peek out and instant headshot you because youve been shown on their screen for like a second already due to desync
[2023-01-03 02:58:37] <%HawksHolocrons> I think majority of people who have actually played get it bro
[2023-01-03 02:58:41] <smooshpig> he said it doesnt suck lol
[2023-01-03 02:58:41] <%BreakZw> I think I'd have fun with this game but I can't afford it
[2023-01-03 02:58:48] <+delafunkkkk> if someone thinks the game sucks then you simply havent played it according to hutch
[2023-01-03 02:58:48] <%+Moti0n_> this game is amazing, the audio is hot garbo
[2023-01-03 02:58:50] <%+Lajukes> I think most tarkov players have felt the way summit feels rn, I know I have many times lol. my friend usually has to reel me back in
[2023-01-03 02:58:50] <thefoundninja> Can't have a good wipe every wipe, I normally have a great wipe, this wipe is KICKING MY ASS
[2023-01-03 02:58:54] <%Bailz94> I love this game lol

[2023-01-03 02:59:08] <%$kimmeltoe009> this game is the one of the most skill gapped out today. gun play doesn't win you anything. map knowledge trumps all
[2023-01-03 02:59:12] <%chaotic_kix> I agree his chat gets me more than he does..they just keep on instigating
[2023-01-03 02:59:13] <AnthonyHomie69> I think there is more modders now days on it compared to before
[2023-01-03 02:59:16] <%mumblesgaming> I love this game but im terrible at it but still try and enjoy it. i guess through time.
[2023-01-03 02:59:16] <SiiL3NTSN1P3> Bro this song is from smackdown vs raw right?
[2023-01-03 02:59:16] <tarkovian420> everyone that actually plays this game has a love hate relationship with it
[2023-01-03 02:59:19] <wildchild395> im starting to think they cant actually fix the audio.
[2023-01-03 02:59:26] <%HawksHolocrons> I took last wipe off i hate this game so much, but im back because i fucking LOVE this game so much hahaha
[2023-01-03 02:59:26] <+Lavafluxx> Audio needs to be fixed
[2023-01-03 02:59:26] <roshigaming29> I think everyone is broke and is camping harder
[2023-01-03 02:59:27] <%Langle> I think the Game needs Server Fucking Upgrade, Cause Dont get me Wrong, there are those Moments/Days that just Kick you in the balls and beat you to your Lowest Points! But then the other days You are just Destroying People and their Brains
[2023-01-03 02:59:28] <smooshpig> yall need to chill with the DMs im getting straight gang banged by you guys plz stop
[2023-01-03 02:59:30] <jAmzye> Tarkov is one of those games where you hate it one day and love it the other day
[2023-01-03 02:59:30] <LostMaryT> seems like most games that have come out in the past 3/4 years are broken and fixed with patches. It's why i tend to watch streamers instead of playing games myself
[2023-01-03 02:59:31] <%+wheeziie> @BreakZw Its not cheap. Try to get it when its on sale. Get the basic version and you can upgrade.
[2023-01-03 02:59:31] <%$DefiantMF> @thiccP_ No problem. hutchmfPls
[2023-01-03 02:59:32] <%CReaper210> I love so much about this game, I'm just not a PvP person. I wish there was something worthwhile for PvE
[2023-01-03 02:59:32] <wildchild395> its been messed up since day 1
[2023-01-03 02:59:34] <$Steelhuf> @hutchmf the game is not bad but it should revert back to alpha and focus on bug fixing not adding new features that break more of the game
[2023-01-03 02:59:34] <@%^StreamElements> Keep up with Hutch when he isn't streaming with his Twitter: https://twitter.com/HutchMF
[2023-01-03 02:59:37] <%+StayHomeDadz> I haven't seen a single cheater all wipe
[2023-01-03 02:59:37] <%lil_izy69> I love this game there is things that can be fixed but it's quite a good game
[2023-01-03 02:59:46] <+ThePickleDickBill> @HutchMF its one of them nights. Keep doin you bro. appreciate the good vibes. been lovin you and your positivity since gasoline green brotha
[2023-01-03 02:59:47] <%$darkreaperx38> ive died to one cheater in over 50 raids
[2023-01-03 02:59:48] <AnthonyHomie69> @HutchMF Yeah but i think there is modders that are using an aimbot now that isnt so strong but just enough
[2023-01-03 02:59:50] <gooselovesu> i love this game, i think the ppl complaining are the ones who jus cant handle it tbh
[2023-01-03 02:59:52] <ragnarr1g> maybe spend less time in raids in and out repeat
[2023-01-03 02:59:52] <%fiveonefiveoh> @LoneWolftvv streets, audio, and if they can work on the desync would be nice. Hackers are relatively under control (fingers crossed)
[2023-01-03 02:59:54] <dexxhunterz> havnt come across even 1 cheater
[2023-01-03 02:59:56] <%Baeltox> only thing i hate this wipe is multilevel buildings, when people sound like theyre right next to you while on other floors

[2023-01-03 03:24:59] <Cleartrax> The Hoonigans Instagram account just made a post announcing that Ken Block passed away in a snowmobile accident earlier today. It's with our deepest regrets that we can confirm that Ken Block passed away in a snowmobile accident today. Ken was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband. He will be incredibly missed. Please respect the family's privacy at this time while they grieve

[2023-01-03 04:10:29] <%+Landon7K> never play reserve when you dont have red rebel
[2023-01-03 04:10:32] <zdrak_666> throw a bunch of nades
[2023-01-03 04:10:38] <%lil_izy69> the audio and AI are really fucked
[2023-01-03 04:10:39] <+pineappled1ck> Raiders are bosses KEKW
[2023-01-03 04:10:41] <+FierzeTV> i dont play reserve unless i got a red rebel to get out that way if not the map is ass
[2023-01-03 04:10:43] <%Nitranion> reserve with out RR is hell sometimes
[2023-01-03 04:10:49] <harisdajebac> @Landon7K AGREED
[2023-01-03 04:10:59] <+imspazzinout> ya nades and flank a different angle i guess

[2023-01-03 04:12:26] <+imspazzinout> agreed, there are no normal extracts, they all require some bullshii extra to get out
[2023-01-03 04:12:29] <zdrak_666> i usually do hermetic door or wait for train
[2023-01-03 04:12:32] <%lil_izy69> wtf dude
[2023-01-03 04:12:53] <%+mutedmedic> red rebel actually makes reserve awesome
[2023-01-03 04:13:03] <%stuffowf> either that or glori slow leans til he gets a angle where he gets an arm and shoot that way if he has no nades

[2023-01-03 04:21:53] <%BreakZw> the reality is, human body's are easily broken. Anything could go wrong in a normal hit.

[2023-01-03 18:05:55] <%flamejet> aren't they random in a general area?
[2023-01-03 18:06:01] <+DatrikZ> It was like a small dirt patch in the middle of the rocks... that's BS

[2023-01-03 18:07:58] <+xGraype> all good, you were in teaching mode talking about good loot spawns etc, not paying attention to chat. shit happens
[2023-01-03 18:08:06] <+big_3z> they added in no nipple detection mines
[2023-01-03 18:08:13] <+bugman1> @hutchmf so I cant tell if summit hates the game or not but he's been playing a lot sumFast
[2023-01-03 18:08:16] <%flamejet> @iNoMadBro nah, he'd have to get up and walk around salty for a few minutes sumFast
[2023-01-03 18:08:18] <+DatrikZ> On the clip, we can see it was on a small dirt patch in the middle of all the rocks... it's just really bad luck I guess
[2023-01-03 18:08:19] <+itzthatgamerdad> Hi im new here :D hows tarkov treating you Hutch ?
[2023-01-03 18:08:24] <%IUltraxx> @bull009 why would the rogues put signs there, that they put mines/claymore there to defend the base

[2023-01-03 18:44:20] <+Chromadrakon> Thats not a fix lol the devs have to add effects to the materials and occlusion to sections of the map for audio layers. Laying more filters onto dogshit ain't gonna help.

[2023-01-03 23:08:52] <%$StopDropNRofl> yeah don't use sonic at the same time. Also, if you're using multiple inputs and outputs being routed together, each output can have settings set for it. You only want it set in one place.

[2023-01-03 23:31:56] <+No_Skill_Scrub> sordins are more bassy than comtacs etc, should sound different
[2023-01-03 23:31:59] <+Aw4k3ned> so should your irl headphones be stereo instead of surround?
[2023-01-03 23:32:01] <+rougegtn> only software and hardware, not headsets
[2023-01-03 23:32:01] <%SeeraX2> @SeeraX2 Nope, when I turn on DTS X Headphone,,, it turns into same like KLEAN
[2023-01-03 23:32:05] <yno7_> if u guys wanna test properly, u both need the same headphones, stand in same spot, same gun, etc...
[2023-01-03 23:32:07] <+dr_thrax010> not the real headphones man
[2023-01-03 23:32:11] <PAPA_ANTONZ> Does he have binural on?

[2023-01-03 23:32:14] <+1x_slayer_x1> your headphones make no differnce to what chat will hear
[2023-01-03 23:32:14] <0x0Byte> wait is he running his game audio through a pre-amp???

[2023-01-03 23:33:37] <+Chromadrakon> i could replicate that software in eq in 4 seconds its just boosting the low freq thats why steps are louder.
[2023-01-03 23:33:52] <+Waffles19SD> spacial audio is legit af
[2023-01-03 23:33:59] <%tomc1k> Pretty much the same, cant tell
[2023-01-03 23:33:59] <GKBTBL> sounds the same to me
[2023-01-03 23:33:59] <JPSMO> louder
[2023-01-03 23:34:02] <%tomc1k> range difference
[2023-01-03 23:34:06] <%tomc1k> sounds closer
[2023-01-03 23:34:06] <+RubDubDucky> You can tell the direction better.
[2023-01-03 23:34:06] <@%^StreamElements> Check out HutchMF's YouTube at: https://youtube.com/c/HutchMF
[2023-01-03 23:34:08] <0x0Byte> DTS off is better imo
[2023-01-03 23:34:09] <EvanWolf> sounds the ssame
[2023-01-03 23:34:12] <+AquaJPN> DTS better than THX Spatial chat? HmmNotes
[2023-01-03 23:34:12] <AjaxKingston> i mean im too lazy. thers lil trick u can do to see diff
[2023-01-03 23:34:20] <+ToxicRickD99> I don’t hear any difference
[2023-01-03 23:34:36] <%+Calonis> Holy so far
[2023-01-03 23:34:36] <@%^StreamElements> Hangout with Hutch and his community while he isn't streaming. Join his Discord at: https://discord.gg/UwfzH5vYjr
[2023-01-03 23:34:38] <0x0Byte> the volume difference between looking away and at the source is louder with DTS off
[2023-01-03 23:34:39] <%$SimbaYugen> Seems more accurate
[2023-01-03 23:34:39] <%tomc1k> i can tell the range is way closer
[2023-01-03 23:34:42] <+TheUntouchable> @Chromadrakon prob but there may also be spatial effects
[2023-01-03 23:34:48] <Mamp___> On sounds louder no?

[2023-01-03 23:35:17] <AjaxKingston> for science, a chatter could run all the audio through audacity, and see if it changes by overlapping it lol
[2023-01-03 23:35:31] <EvanWolf> sounds the same
[2023-01-03 23:35:31] <deadlyvirus0006> and that is 20$?
[2023-01-03 23:35:32] <killredbeard> sounds kinda the same distance
[2023-01-03 23:35:33] <+TheUntouchable> mmm same but direction was tighter
[2023-01-03 23:35:35] <Ayomeer> I would have guessed in front of gas on both

[2023-01-03 23:35:39] <nockerous> audio seems to almost get louder when you point toward the sound source
[2023-01-03 23:35:39] <Ayomeer> not behind
[2023-01-03 23:35:39] <%$SimbaYugen> With it off it’s just a general direction with it on you can pinpoint him better @hutchmf
[2023-01-03 23:35:43] <+RubDubDucky> The audio cone is more precise.
[2023-01-03 23:35:43] <+Waffles19SD> spacial audio is needed
[2023-01-03 23:35:43] <%SeeraX2> Actually hutch has windows 11, I have same audio MUFFLED as Klean on windows 10
[2023-01-03 23:35:44] <Ayomeer> like way closer to you
[2023-01-03 23:35:45] <+Waffles19SD> imo
[2023-01-03 23:35:48] <mclovins272> is it worth tha frame drops
[2023-01-03 23:35:49] <bStrukt> He is pretty damn far though
[2023-01-03 23:35:49] <Ferfin> I don't think there's a big enough difference to tell
[2023-01-03 23:35:50] <%+ThiccEwok> Thats what she said
[2023-01-03 23:35:52] <0x0Byte> the volume difference when looking away and at the source is different
[2023-01-03 23:35:53] <+sL1MTman> Go listen to kleans stream that shit sounds busted
[2023-01-03 23:35:53] <+Money_LEGACY> you just have a narrower sound cone
[2023-01-03 23:35:54] <Bleachplease420> sounds louder for me when on
[2023-01-03 23:35:54] <%tomc1k> tell him shoot towards dorms @HutchMF
[2023-01-03 23:35:55] <%SeeraX2> @HutchMF go listen to Klean's Stream
[2023-01-03 23:35:57] <nockerous> you can tell direction better when moving head with DTS on
[2023-01-03 23:35:57] <%+Devil__Donkey> try and shoot at him
[2023-01-03 23:36:07] <roshigaming29> The headphones are almost like dts itself
[2023-01-03 23:36:07] <%$SimbaYugen> Way better
[2023-01-03 23:36:07] <xGhostEffect> how do you download DTS???
[2023-01-03 23:36:09] <+AquaJPN> Ima have to give it a try over THX HmmNotes
[2023-01-03 23:36:21] <Ayomeer> he put the tac4s back on tho
[2023-01-03 23:36:24] <187Veritas187> you should follow klean
[2023-01-03 23:36:39] <+thetalkingzebra> yup fish bowl
[2023-01-03 23:36:40] <%tomc1k> yeah his audio, like the wind makes his audio fishy
[2023-01-03 23:36:45] <0x0Byte> it sounds like Klean has 3D audio emulation enabled in his headset drivers sofware
[2023-01-03 23:36:46] <+TheUntouchable> oh yeah hmm
[2023-01-03 23:36:48] <haroldgene> ya sounds real bad on his end
[2023-01-03 23:36:49] <%+Kreamfire> @xGhostEffect windows store
[2023-01-03 23:36:49] <+Money_LEGACY> mad echo
[2023-01-03 23:36:49] <%tomc1k> the wind makes him in a bowl
[2023-01-03 23:36:50] <%+Marrked> @HutchMF try with binnaural on and off. Double 3D processing might fuck some shit up.
[2023-01-03 23:36:54] <Ferfin> it also depends on your headphones that you are currently wearing in real life...can give a huge difference in received sound/sound stage

[2023-01-03 23:37:26] <+Money_LEGACY> I think spatial does sound like there is more space...hence, spatial haha wtf
[2023-01-03 23:37:32] <AjaxKingston> ye, if u compard hutch original audio and his audio, if its both better than ..oiriginal tarkov. dam lab tests are confusing
[2023-01-03 23:37:33] <MrJPwastaken> @HutchMF did you take a look at pestily toughts on this wipe?
[2023-01-03 23:37:34] <mclovins272> not worth with frame drops
[2023-01-03 23:37:38] <nuurns> Does hutch have binaural on?

[2023-01-03 23:37:53] <+runosrevenge> NO. BUT IT DOES HELP
[2023-01-03 23:37:54] <%tomc1k> Try labs
[2023-01-03 23:37:58] <Dorasu> so now we need to get third party [programs to play this game wtf is going on everyone started talking about this shit
[2023-01-03 23:38:05] <0x0Byte> I'd say its subjective
[2023-01-03 23:38:07] <@%AyeGavMF> it changes it for the better
[2023-01-03 23:38:09] <masterhenkie> @SeeraX2 Yeah same here
[2023-01-03 23:38:10] <nockerous> i think directional, esp close range, is A LOT BETER WITH DTX
[2023-01-03 23:38:10] <llndex_> use a compressor
[2023-01-03 23:38:11] <iyiusashi> Its not head and shoulders its dove
[2023-01-03 23:38:14] <+powerwindows3813> is windows sonic good enough??

[2023-01-03 23:38:30] <@%AyeGavMF> its not a perfection its an improvement
[2023-01-03 23:38:32] <+ajint56> you should test windows sonic too

[2023-01-03 23:39:25] <+Chromadrakon> direction isnt the problem its distance and vertically. all these softwares need somthing to take from and tarkov is uncomplete with its oculus sound. Another problem is hutch is someone running this game with binural when none of us use it because we aren't sponsored by nasa.
[2023-01-03 23:39:25] <@%^StreamElements> Keep up with Hutch when he isn't streaming with his Twitter: https://twitter.com/HutchMF

[2023-01-03 23:43:14] <+AquaJPN> Binaural takes more CPU power for people getting lag

[2023-01-03 23:47:19] <%+Marrked> @MCBOUNTYCRAFT you'll probably have to try both. If you have a headset with a wide sound stage already, too much space is going to ruin your ability to position footsteps.

[2023-01-03 23:49:59] <%+Marrked> @HutchMF there should be a disclaimer on this for people using certain DACs. Some drivers don't allow for spatial audio. For instance, the Schiit Fulla 3. Unless they added it recently.
[2023-01-03 23:50:06] <0x0Byte> @astrosardonic its not just different audio levels tho. Headphones out have built-in preamps (because headphones typically aren't powered) line-out is a line level signal un-amplified
[2023-01-03 23:50:07] <BatChestington> i heard that makes it run faster
