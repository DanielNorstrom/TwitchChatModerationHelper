[2022-12-29 15:49:13] <%+angeryhog> for some reason that skull shooting fire laser is not considered a trap
[2022-12-29 15:49:16] <%+angeryhog> which is bs imo

[2022-12-29 15:49:43] <+Erg05> the skull is considered an enemy for some reason instead a trap
[2022-12-29 15:49:49] <%+angeryhog> no, its not affected by trap speed, its affected by monster action speed tho
[2022-12-29 15:50:04] <%+angeryhog> so getting the 30% increased speed one is giga op for that skull
[2022-12-29 15:50:49] <%pdiddly63> yeah laser skull is BS with speed
