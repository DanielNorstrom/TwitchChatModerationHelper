[2022-12-27 17:36:12] <Spurdofug> @brightbanner likewise, it sucked the fun out of these kind of games. I wish more CPU's would either make stronger single cores (instead of going for 32 cores) or  these games would adopt multicore

[2022-12-27 17:44:46] <WishingOnAWendy> That will actually make way more than 100 drinks. Each time they brew a drink, depending on how many plants are in the stack they pick up they'll brew like 10+ drinks per brew drink order

[2022-12-27 17:47:36] <Raverumble> @axcess they might be checking everyday despite the previous check. So if you had 9 doors yesterday and only manage to make 2, then the check today will say 11 doors and the dwarf won't make 10 doors today. Probably it works like it though

[2022-12-27 17:48:56] <%axcess> @Raverumble That's how it works to my understanding.  Anyone know if I can make it to check it for "max number of x" in stockpile and if there isn't, then make until "x amount" is achieved?

[2022-12-27 17:49:38] <GorillaxJax> it's 5 per plant, but if there is a stack it could be up to 25

[2022-12-27 18:04:53] <mcvenor6> I think DF is victim of this Roumer and that it "appears" complex and advance, but to be honest, its not so much. Some simple bedrooms and a farm and your good to go

[2022-12-27 18:11:49] <+calisin> leaves can be cooked
[2022-12-27 18:11:52] <%+Harqinz> Quarry bushes may be processed at a farmer's workshop by selecting the Process plant to bag work order. You will need an empty bag available for this task. This will result in bags of quarry bush leaves, which then must be cooked in the kitchen to be edible. Quarry bushes cannot be brewed into alcohol. - @ambiguousamphibian straight from the wiki

[2022-12-27 18:30:16] <Zaldan_01> iirc you can set water source/pond/fishing areas. This could be useful to keep you dwarves fishing from inside your moat instead of outside

[2022-12-27 18:30:26] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian Good option would be near the dining hall/where dwarves idle
[2022-12-27 18:30:28] <murrmakesstuff> Floor should be what you want but drawbride is cooler

[2022-12-27 18:31:06] <%pieboy321> limestone is used for makling steel, so claystone is better

[2022-12-27 19:43:09] <LordOfBulls> I feel so good, I might go observe a waterfall and throw myself over. :)
[2022-12-27 19:43:12] <replacehim> yeah replacethem
[2022-12-27 19:43:16] <Cobalt_Ethon> Heyyo :D
[2022-12-27 19:43:29] <teeniestbird> succumbed to the beauty of the waterfall
[2022-12-27 19:43:34] <%+Harqinz> @replacehim this guy sounds like he knows what he's talkin about
[2022-12-27 19:43:54] <%L0rdClang> ambiHello
[2022-12-27 19:44:06] <%$quantumfoam42> I think it's PRETTY
[2022-12-27 19:44:14] <%+Harqinz> it's artistic
[2022-12-27 19:44:15] <alan97paga> The floor is... special, unique.
[2022-12-27 19:44:21] <reddvvv> Yep!

[2022-12-27 19:44:36] <%$quantumfoam42> The hardest button to button?
[2022-12-27 19:44:37] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian the All button was added the day after your last DF stream I was on Blinds stream when the patch dropped lol
[2022-12-27 19:44:38] <reddvvv> NO its new
[2022-12-27 19:44:38] <alan97paga> yep
[2022-12-27 19:44:41] <Cpt_Chug> its been there for a few weeks
[2022-12-27 19:44:46] <zephyrwave> It was added second patch
[2022-12-27 19:44:47] <Sauerkraut933> its been there since premium
[2022-12-27 19:44:49] <ReRatch> it wasn't it's new
[2022-12-27 19:45:21] <%+Harqinz> All button was 100% in the first 2 patches for premium
[2022-12-27 19:45:22] <%+VoodoKid> it will
[2022-12-27 19:45:24] <teeniestbird> is this floor an abstract rendition of a beach landscape?
[2022-12-27 19:45:27] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian it's sorterd by distance
[2022-12-27 19:45:44] <%+kthxbye910> @teeniestbird perfect
[2022-12-27 19:45:48] <Sauerkraut933> @ReRatch my bad then, I guess i started playing premium after the second patch =D

[2022-12-27 19:45:50] <UnderDwellers> Cheer50   Big fan!
[2022-12-27 19:45:55] <ChilliDogDave> @ambiguousamphibian you can channel a brook to break its roof
[2022-12-27 19:46:07] <+Via_Infinity> you can channel out the top of the brook
[2022-12-27 19:46:13] <%+therm_scissorpuch> you always get bonus points with us
[2022-12-27 19:46:15] <NotToast> I thought moats all came with crocodiles preequipped.

[2022-12-27 19:46:32] <+plalmtree> is that dwarf still trapped in the moat?
[2022-12-27 19:46:34] VIEWERS: 2¬†139
[2022-12-27 19:46:38] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian some creatures can climb the walls/jump from a nearby treebranch.
[2022-12-27 19:46:46] <Cpt_Chug> does anyone know why the only entrance to my base (forbidden) is being made passable on its own?
[2022-12-27 19:46:52] <Neroxen_> Rip the corners
[2022-12-27 19:46:55] <%+Harqinz> @only way to make the walls TOTALLY inaccessible is one up and one OUT
[2022-12-27 19:46:57] <+ThePerfectLink> you can channel on the moat and it removes the traversibility
[2022-12-27 19:47:01] <Siggenlh> how many drowned dwarves are we at?
[2022-12-27 19:47:05] <Zaldan_01> You can't build walls through corners
[2022-12-27 19:47:21] <fr0zenpoo> deconstruct one wall and let them build the corner
[2022-12-27 19:47:21] <barenski11> hello
[2022-12-27 19:47:30] <%+Harqinz> @Siggenlh drowned, 0. Traumatized by water at lest 3
[2022-12-27 19:47:34] <PerpetuaLux> They can't build through corners, it's very annoying
[2022-12-27 19:47:43] <Neroxen_> monkaS dwarves standing right next to waterfall
[2022-12-27 19:47:53] <Zaldan_01> you basically have to build corners first, then the rest of the wall
[2022-12-27 19:47:56] <Siggenlh> we need to crank those drowning numbers up or something is wrong with the game
[2022-12-27 19:48:19] <%+wulfenburg> LOOK AT ME, I AM THE FORTRESS
[2022-12-27 19:48:23] <slovakhiin> Will you be attacked at some time?
[2022-12-27 19:48:29] <Siggenlh> i saw somenone put a tavern or dining area near a open waterfall. so many drunk and fighting dwarves fell down LUL

[2022-12-27 19:48:57] <Cpt_Chug> does anyone know of any instance where a forbidden door would be made passable without my input? i am so confused
[2022-12-27 19:48:59] <%+Harqinz> @slovakhiin @ambiguousamphibian With the exception of random thieves/kobolds proper raids don't happen until 80 population
[2022-12-27 19:49:11] <%+wulfenburg> can you make me some food please
[2022-12-27 19:49:12] <%+Harqinz> @Cpt_Chug Troll could knock it down
[2022-12-27 19:49:17] <Siggenlh> are we at the stage of dwarf maiming minecarts?
[2022-12-27 19:49:19] <+knif3wif3> Nice!
[2022-12-27 19:49:21] <%+kthxbye910> Nice

[2022-12-27 19:50:01] <heroicastrid> military using pick axes rely on Miner skill so Miners will be your strongest natural fighters if you have no military LUL
[2022-12-27 19:50:08] <Zyjem> this base looks neat
[2022-12-27 19:50:23] <ChilliDogDave> @heroicastrid shame pick fighting is still dumb because its to RNG
[2022-12-27 19:50:24] <%aquaverve> aww
[2022-12-27 19:50:34] VIEWERS: 2¬†030
[2022-12-27 19:51:21] <heroicastrid> @ChilliDogDave it should scale with Miner skill and Fighter/Striker Ability LUL
[2022-12-27 19:51:46] <%+Harqinz> @ambiguousamphibian The unfinished pieces of the surface floor//wall were probably suspended, you'll have to manually resume construction
[2022-12-27 19:51:57] <ChilliDogDave> @heroicastrid even if it did would still suck because picks are both pierce weapons with no ability to slash and they are slow
[2022-12-27 19:52:13] <Ulura> did someone die again?
[2022-12-27 19:52:15] <iamamitten> yeah picks aren't GOOD weapons, but they are weapons
[2022-12-27 19:52:19] <+MiindBlowiing> Thanks for the stream !

[2022-12-27 19:52:44] <+OriginalQuality> I said that i miss you
[2022-12-27 19:52:55] <heroicastrid> you need targets for each dwarf in a markdwarf barracks LUL
[2022-12-27 19:53:11] <ChilliDogDave> i unfortunately arrived late so i need to catch up on the VOD but i have noticed you have 2 chairs per tables, dorfs wont share tables like rimworld
[2022-12-27 19:53:22] <gutatu_voador> when a df video comes out?
[2022-12-27 19:54:14] <ChilliDogDave> i see, still a jank setup some dorfs get confused by that
[2022-12-27 19:54:15] <reddvvv> I dont think thats how it works
[2022-12-27 19:54:18] <%+VoodoKid> one per table if it has 3 legs no?

[2022-12-27 19:54:59] <reddvvv> its amazing
[2022-12-27 19:54:59] <ChilliDogDave> dorfs are pretty dumb so if you make something complex they usually brain fart :)
[2022-12-27 19:55:30] <%+Harqinz> dance floor is actually REQUIRED for taverns for this reason
[2022-12-27 19:55:40] <kerjava0> do you have to worry about collapsing  ?
[2022-12-27 19:55:48] <%+wulfenburg> To gary!
[2022-12-27 19:55:53] <ChilliDogDave> @kerjava0 only if you cut down all supports
[2022-12-27 19:55:53] <CannibulCake> <3 thanks for another fun stream
[2022-12-27 19:55:58] <%+Harqinz> @kerjava0 yes but you need to mine out like half a screens worth of rock
[2022-12-27 19:56:00] <iamamitten> @kerjava0 normally yes, but there's an option to disable cave-ins

[2022-12-27 19:56:10] <reddvvv> @kerjava0 I believe there is a mechanic for that but not something you normally worry about.
