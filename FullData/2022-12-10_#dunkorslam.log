[2022-12-10 06:22:06] <%breaketh1> who thinks this is a "late start" Kappa
[2022-12-10 06:22:39] <%shamwhoa> ive never seen him start at what he thinks is on time
[2022-12-10 06:23:09] <%shamwhoa> POGGIES 6 month badge!
[2022-12-10 06:23:46] <TaIanvor> he usuallu starts at this _hour_
[2022-12-10 06:24:24] <%shamwhoa> on time for him was an hour and 25 minutes ago
[2022-12-10 06:26:11] <%DietSilence> does he stream on fridays?

[2022-12-10 06:36:55] <%breaketh1> im just poking at the fact that yesterday he said short stream because he got a late start, but thats the normal start time + maybe 15 min
[2022-12-10 06:37:19] <%shamwhoa> exactly, i was happy about the short rant though
[2022-12-10 06:37:22] <%breaketh1> the way dunks brain works makes me smile
[2022-12-10 06:37:28] <TaIanvor> Does new cosmetics appear at dunkbin only after first shop?
[2022-12-10 06:37:33] <%shamwhoa> nope
[2022-12-10 06:37:43] <%shamwhoa> he updates dunkbin before starting stream
[2022-12-10 06:37:58] <TaIanvor> F so
[2022-12-10 06:38:09] <%shamwhoa> you can use that to tell if he is almost ready

[2022-12-10 07:16:54] <Syfygamer> I dont really follow the eye puzzle but if its encoded similarly to an ethernet signal, then doing a manual version of a router function should give a form of output that might make sense.
[2022-12-10 07:16:55] <%DarkPulse91> they were talking with someone who had no idea what noita was, thats why he didnt do something

[2022-12-10 07:17:34] <%myndzi> @Syfygamer i think you missed what the dude was saying. it's not about routing, it's about how digital data is encoded as an analog signal
[2022-12-10 07:17:37] <%+bacon_pilot> thought it wasthe cap on how much it could heal you
[2022-12-10 07:17:52] <%+RNGrizzly> I mean, I'm certainly happy to be proven wrong if this leads to something, but for me, some guy on Discord going "My friend who does this thing things it's coincidentally related to the thing he does, and that's gonna be what cracks the case" just feels like a major stretch, and for a content creator to turn around and say "We're close to solving it!" based on that is either clickbait or COPIUMSHIPMENT .

[2022-12-10 07:25:01] <%myndzi> i think "definitely" is prematurely strong in all cases until you know the answer :) a great way to fail to solve a puzzle is to assume you know something specific
[2022-12-10 07:25:05] <MiczuPL> @myndzi eye up +2, eye down -2, middle eye 0. Side eyes are only questionable about the value

[2022-12-10 07:25:46] <%myndzi> @MiczuPL that's one reasonable potential interpretation, who knows. but it could also be inspired by or completely unrelated too *shrug* the physical arrangement is a bit odd for a single  value-stream interpretation

If it's on the back of your neck you may have pinched a nerve in your vertebrae while you were sleeping, which in that case best suggestion is a warm compress to increase blood flow to the area.

[2022-12-10 08:40:24] <djlights1> well it's almost certainly not local permutations of deltas on the trigrams, but possible somehow calculating deltas between trigrams E1\W! etc.. It still needs painstaking experiments run to see if any feasible data could emerge.  More answers than questions and didn't warrant a whole video.

[2022-12-10 08:46:29] <%myndzi> followup: seems like 4d-pam5 is unlikely out of the box, at least. the decodping process is involved, and uses redundancy to reduce errors, but in order to accomplish that it does require 8 input values (classed as X or Y? based on even or odd? that then goes into a decoding matrix). naively, you could perceive the x vs y as just straight up 0 or 1 without doing the decoding stuff, but then there's little point to using that method for encoding

[2022-12-10 08:56:47] <Vexilus_> nvm
[2022-12-10 08:56:52] <pyromage1> at least it evaporates

[2022-12-10 08:57:02] <djlights1> at least poison evaporates and isn't flammable right?
[2022-12-10 08:57:02] <%myndzi> so what pam5 is doing is saying "we've got 2 pairs of wires, and each can represent a value. what's the minimum number of values per pair to transmit a byte in a single timing cycle?" you could do it in 4, which would be exactly 2 bits per wire pair, but the additional resolution gives rise to more error potential. so instead, they use 5 values, which gives enough "headroom" to also include enough redundancy for error correction

[2022-12-10 08:57:26] <%myndzi> and that error correction is "built in" in the way it turns the values it reads into an output byte

[2022-12-10 08:58:19] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> well oil isn't *that* common and it's not *that* deadly so it's fine
[2022-12-10 08:58:32] <%myndzi> however, the 5-state values and the physical layout do seem like a clear hint in this direction, so i can understand why the dude would think that; and it doesn't rule out simplifications etc

[2022-12-10 09:13:48] <%BestBardTopNA> EG if you take the spells off directly into the main world, without moving them to inventory or a different wand, it doens't count as "editing" for the perk, so the wand will still heal, so you cna completely empty the wand before firing it

[2022-12-10 09:42:12] <EXPLODEDman> What makes it confusing is the way Noitool displays "Flask," the change in font and lack of icon next to the item makes it seem like it has more to it than it does

[2022-12-10 09:56:34] <%$Tangil_White> @dunkorslam you can apply digging bolt on explosion box, so it will fall through ground

[2022-12-10 09:57:11] <%JefFunk> matter eater + energy orb will get you up quicker
[2022-12-10 09:57:15] <%+shadowtimebb> egg wand!
[2022-12-10 09:57:21] <+distasion> you only have cast delay on the second block
[2022-12-10 09:57:26] <%Naicii> @DunkOrSlam Grab the matter eater to insta detonate explosive boxes
[2022-12-10 09:57:41] <Chrawnus> on a completely different note, for anyone who doesn't know, explosive detonator is 🤌 when it comes to defensive measures, if you manage to rapid fire it (not too quickly though) you can constantly delete almost every projectile on screen.

[2022-12-10 10:00:20] <volymic> Dunk never uses explosive detonator even though its the best spell in the game, just walk wherever you need to walk to and nothing can hit you.
[2022-12-10 10:00:41] <Chrawnus> @volymic it's definitely up there among the best spells
[2022-12-10 10:01:04] <%Naicii> @DunkOrSlam I sent an image in noita-central that showcases the teleporting cast builds i used this daily
[2022-12-10 10:01:24] <Raewhen> Ive really started to move away from chainsaw because of the game instability it causes.
[2022-12-10 10:01:51] <%Naicii> Need matter eater
[2022-12-10 10:01:55] <Vexilus_> !bruh Boxes are projectiles so Sigma doesn't work
[2022-12-10 10:01:58] <%Naicii> Then they detonate themselves
[2022-12-10 10:01:59] <brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam plasma detonates boxes quite well
[2022-12-10 10:02:01] <%+lawthahost> put plasma on it
[2022-12-10 10:02:04] <Vexilus_> also Energy Sphere auto detonates boxes
[2022-12-10 10:02:09] <%+lawthahost> plasma on it with homing
[2022-12-10 10:02:19] <%Naicii> @DunkOrSlam Check noita central for images
[2022-12-10 10:02:22] <Vexilus_> @DunkOrSlam Energy Sphere works best
[2022-12-10 10:02:26] <%+shmameron> read vex
[2022-12-10 10:02:29] <Vexilus_> also Sigma does nothing here

[2022-12-10 10:03:46] <volymic> @DunkOrSlam also, you are wondering what to explode the explosives with, maybe, explosive detonator?

[2022-12-10 10:05:07] <%Naicii> @DunkOrSlam Teleporting cast on that explosive wand will spawn the boxes right on the middle of the alchemist and instakill him

[2022-12-10 10:06:07] <Chrawnus> I mean if you rapid fire it it's like 900/1800 mana per second depending on if you 1 or 2 frame it, so yeah, still pretty expensive
[2022-12-10 10:06:23] <%+teh60> @DunkOrSlam why not go down and grab the orb below the steam lake

[2022-12-10 10:09:10] <%tw1stf> tau is my favorite drop anyway, makes finding CoV so much better
[2022-12-10 10:09:35] <%Naicii> alpha and gamma are the best, then tau, then omega, then phi and mu is the worst
[2022-12-10 10:09:47] <%Naicii> Epsilon doesnt count since nobody uses it
[2022-12-10 10:09:56] <Chrawnus> @tw1stf gamma into tau behind a wand refresh is pretty nice, get the advantages of tau for the price of gamma
[2022-12-10 10:10:01] <%tw1stf> yeah thats teh idea

[2022-12-10 10:11:20] <%+duke1102> @DunkOrSlam When will you try out local stable diffusion yourself? Its very easy to install and use.
[2022-12-10 10:11:36] <Chrawnus> I'd rather have tau over alpha, can't do wand refresh shenanigans with alpha. Although you CAN target AC spells with alpha if you have the wand setup right, not that there's many scenarios where that's actually useful
[2022-12-10 10:11:42] <volymic> @DunkOrSlam what was the item radar pointing at in the sky
[2022-12-10 10:11:49] <%Naicii> Wait theres an item on the left side of the altar @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-10 10:11:50] <%+teh60> there was a flask on the left side

[2022-12-10 10:21:54] <%nolava> For a new player searching around a biome = lots of chip damage

[2022-12-10 10:22:13] <%Omnipotent_0> for new player more defensive perks are better imo
[2022-12-10 10:22:13] <%Naicii> Being real though, the only reason dunk didnt take NMS is because he chest rained a bunch of wands

[2022-12-10 10:48:11] <%tw1stf> @noby_y I was not thinking about the first cast, but the second cast. Like after it wraps and grabs mana + lumi, why would it cancel out?

[2022-12-10 10:50:27] <noby_y> @Vexilus_ Taika HAS to be last, because it prevents other Projectiles from being added after it in the same cast state
[2022-12-10 10:50:32] <%tw1stf> @noby_y So to make it simpler by ignoring everything before the wrap entirely, why would something like wrap -> mana -> lumi not work?
[2022-12-10 10:50:48] <Vexilus_> @noby_y ahhh right
[2022-12-10 10:50:50] <%Naicii> now you can add homing wooo
[2022-12-10 10:50:58] <%Naicii> Thats a lot of damage
[2022-12-10 10:50:58] <%+teh60> add a glimmer to reduce lag by notes @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-10 10:51:08] <%Naicii> You can replace the lumi with a chainsaw now too

[2022-12-10 10:51:31] <Vexilus_> I've always wanted to a a homing berserk field build and make enemies merc each other as I watch the chaos
[2022-12-10 10:51:44] <Vexilus_> like that GTA cheat code that made everyone fight each other
[2022-12-10 10:51:58] <volymic> @DunkOrSlam heavy shot instead of vertical?
[2022-12-10 10:52:04] <noby_y> @tw1stf When you'r 1st cast ( Mana + Lumi ) ends, it costs -20 mana. Your wand's max mana is only 2, so the 2nd casts starts with 2 mana, not 20. And the whole 2nd cast is what you would have without wrapping anyway, so it's the same. Even worse actually, because you're firing 2 times slower when wrapping
[2022-12-10 10:52:09] <%nikita20031405> POGGIES

[2022-12-10 11:11:06] <%+duke1102> #trolldinner @DunkOrSlam I think using the Fungal Curse mod with 99 shifts happening every 60 frames was not the wisest idea, noticed once there were so many bridge bosses. https://i.imgur.com/jQhxjEU.mp4

[2022-12-10 11:39:42] <%WaxNumen> @MoroseMonkey Honestly depends on how good at the game you are, my first win was carried by a healthium flask and I definitely used more than 10 heals

[2022-12-10 11:40:23] <%+teh60> also @Teeheel general concept is note spells have innate piercing that does not dmg the player, but they have short lifetime and no damage to them, so dunk uses modifers to add dmg and lifetime for this great DPS wand

[2022-12-10 11:44:01] <%Ventusol> @DunkOrSlam I think Twitch knows what chat wants you to stream dnkSus
[2022-12-10 11:44:05] <Chrawnus> @brbrmensch I think he's wondering about the daily specifically, not generally
[2022-12-10 11:44:08] <%Naicii> No it can spawn in the Daily without you having it unlocked @brbrmensch
[2022-12-10 11:44:22] <%Naicii> Mu is ass
[2022-12-10 11:44:23] <MoroseMonkey> @WaxNumen True. But when looking back, those first boss kills are so much more exciting than killing them once you have figured it out
[2022-12-10 11:44:33] <Seth092> @brbrmensch havent killed master yet hence the question
[2022-12-10 11:44:33] <%brbrmensch> yes, you get to daily -> add trigger is spawned -> it's unlocked for you now
[2022-12-10 11:44:53] <%Naicii> No
[2022-12-10 11:44:56] <Chrawnus> That sounds wrong to me
[2022-12-10 11:45:02] <%brbrmensch> it does sound wrong, i know
[2022-12-10 11:45:04] <%+teh60> no
[2022-12-10 11:45:05] <%WaxNumen> @MoroseMonkey True. That's why I never use cheese kills these days
[2022-12-10 11:45:14] <%Naicii> If you go to a regular run after you cast it on a daily you won't find it
[2022-12-10 11:45:23] <Dargie1> I don't think the Alchemist has ever not dropped wand refresh for me
[2022-12-10 11:45:30] <$DragonfaceX> I bought Bits and Twitch scammed me Sadge all my time playing Runescape was wasted.
[2022-12-10 11:45:38] <Seth092> ohh wand refresh dropped from the alch for me tho
[2022-12-10 11:45:38] <%brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam i remember letaali saying "just spawning unlocks spells because game can't spawn locked items" so that's what i'm basing on
[2022-12-10 11:45:55] <%Ventusol> @DragonfaceX Sadge
[2022-12-10 11:46:07] <+donsnypa> I got that trough alchemist never had add trigger yet however
[2022-12-10 11:46:16] <%Lordwootman> @brbrmensch daily is different
[2022-12-10 11:46:22] <Chrawnus> yeah, daily doesn't work under the same rules as normal runs
[2022-12-10 11:46:30] <Viking2512> daily is built different
[2022-12-10 11:46:46] <%Lordwootman> the only spell shop that will change in the daily is eye room
[2022-12-10 11:46:47] <MoroseMonkey> @WaxNumen Same here. No cheese and new wand builds if I can manage
[2022-12-10 11:46:48] <%brbrmensch> @donsnypa it's quite rare though, check hell shop
[2022-12-10 11:46:50] <Seth092> @donsnypa i havent found the add trigger too , must be unlucky rng
[2022-12-10 11:46:56] <%WUOTE> So you know: better screenshake default settings are mild (not like in the vid you last saw) @dunkorslam
[2022-12-10 11:46:57] <victorytoad> ever do a challenge run with a fresh install where you have no unlocks?

[2022-12-10 11:47:06] <%Larandar> uni100 The daily is different, you can find all the spells in hellshops but it won't unlock them
[2022-12-10 11:47:07] <%ThisIsTabmoc> omg dunk told someone to go to hell
[2022-12-10 11:47:08] <Keltai_> D:
[2022-12-10 11:47:17] <%WUOTE> @victorytoad no
[2022-12-10 11:47:17] <Celllie> isnt trigger from master of masters?
[2022-12-10 11:47:27] <%Naicii> Yea
[2022-12-10 11:47:43] <%WaxNumen> @victorytoad Wouldn't really be a challenge run, because the bosses you kill to get important unlocks also drop those unlocks on death, so you just go and kill them. Having spells unlocked doesn't change much
[2022-12-10 11:47:43] <%Naicii> I never unlocked requirement spells but saved them to progress through daily run hell shop
[2022-12-10 11:47:50] <MoroseMonkey> Pretty lights
[2022-12-10 11:47:58] <%+teh60> @Celllie yes, add trigger/timer/expier trigger and wand refresh are the MoM's pool, but as said because alch can drop wand refresh you get the progress as if u got MoM's pool unlocked now, so can find trigger
[2022-12-10 11:48:06] <%Larandar> @DunkOrSlam yes, that's how I got the progress a few spells withtout the unlock
[2022-12-10 11:48:07] <%brbrmensch> @Lordwootman @Larandar so you can use stuff in daily and it won't unlock even though it's added to progress?

[2022-12-10 11:49:51] <%BarbleBapkins> Chat will be happy to backseat Rimworld
[2022-12-10 11:49:55] <%brbrmensch> @teh60 old man will not get out of it, spare him
[2022-12-10 11:50:12] <AnimusHeart> I do recommend it even as solo, takes a while to learn and you might need wiki at hand but it's worth it
[2022-12-10 11:50:13] <winterofcreation> You have not even tried streaming either one yet, so far streams of DF proved to be interesting
[2022-12-10 11:50:20] <%+teh60> but...but the factory must grow, which includes the old man playing it @brbrmensch
[2022-12-10 11:50:21] <%Teeheel> @dunkorslam So long as you dont get taken by a fae mood
[2022-12-10 11:50:35] <%ThisIsTabmoc> @DunkOrSlam Having chat show you things in Rimworld would speed up the learning process a lot, like in Terraria

[2022-12-10 11:51:10] <mynamesmantid> rimworld is pretty easy to get into compared to dwarf fortress
[2022-12-10 11:51:45] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> gaben would be proud

[2022-12-10 11:52:00] <Chrawnus> To know if you have a specific spell unlocked you can go to AppData\LocalLow\Nolla_Games_Noita\save00\persistent\flags and check if the corresponding flag is there. For example if you want to know if the add trigger spells are unlocked, you should have files there named action_add_death_trigger, action_add_timer and action_add_trigger
[2022-12-10 11:52:03] <%+teh60> @brbrmensch honestly i would be so down for 90 player lobby where we dont bring in blueprints and just mass mine materials/attack biters for dunk and give advice LUL

[2022-12-10 12:05:22] <+tOne422> now spawn  a bunch of enemies to pick them up and watch the chaos unfold
[2022-12-10 12:05:33] <%brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam piercing energy sphere is also a whisp
[2022-12-10 12:05:36] <%+BroFaSho> I joined to wand city
[2022-12-10 12:05:36] <Gastogh> does homing rock rock on the invisible spirits of pheromoned wands dunkorslam
[2022-12-10 12:05:43] <%robotic_llama> roger, roger.. what's our vector, victor?
[2022-12-10 12:05:53] <Gastogh> work*
[2022-12-10 12:05:53] <%brbrmensch> @Gastogh yes
[2022-12-10 12:05:54] <%WUOTE> @wckdneer you asked a question. Doesnt matter what i want, YOU want to add the emote back and are trying to “cheat” the system. Remember — these a real live people youre dealing with. If it offends them or something something you kinda making a dick move
[2022-12-10 12:05:56] <%tw1stf> @DunkOrSlam The reason projetiles with -1 lifetime become wisps is because it's a hardcored value. Some things, like literally rocks, have a lifetime of -1 naturally
[2022-12-10 12:06:02] <%+aTurgidKnave> why not just grab a quick backpack, go grab the wand refresh, then come back?
[2022-12-10 12:06:15] <Gastogh> I meant the ones that drop money
[2022-12-10 12:06:18] <%brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam piercing energy sphere is also a whisp
[2022-12-10 12:06:20] <%Dr_h0nK> Thanks 4 pointing out the crab hand, i just found a heart in there
[2022-12-10 12:06:22] <Gastogh> not from Taikasauva
[2022-12-10 12:06:55] <Chrawnus> @tw1stf what exactly did you look for? Earthquake is named "crumbling_earth" in the files, so you'd have to look for "action_crumbling_earth" and "card_unlocked_crumbling_earth" to know if they've been properly unlocked
[2022-12-10 12:07:33] <+Grimhof> W- What did I join too?
[2022-12-10 12:07:38] <%KeviRun> Who would win? 1000 wands or two Rocky Bois?
[2022-12-10 12:07:40] <%WUOTE> @chrawnus @tw1stf what we talking about? EQ is an orb inlock
[2022-12-10 12:07:44] <%NoLeftCochlea> @Gastogh yes, but they tend to splash the pherimone around and deplete it
[2022-12-10 12:07:44] <%+Ruthbane> @Grimhof Shhhhhhh
[2022-12-10 12:07:45] <MangoRayosi> its like christmas, but with much death
[2022-12-10 12:07:50] <Kilderash> I think you need more wands
[2022-12-10 12:07:56] <victorytoad> "quick simple wand farm rq here chat"
[2022-12-10 12:07:58] <Gastogh> ah, thanks
[2022-12-10 12:08:03] <monee_san> This looks more like rainbow-road LUL
[2022-12-10 12:08:05] <Chrawnus> @WUOTE just the flags folder and how to use it to check if you've unlocked a certain spell
[2022-12-10 12:08:07] <%tw1stf> @Chrawnus Oh okay that is interesting, I have "action_crumbling_earth" in my files but i DO NOT have "card_unlocked_crumbling_earth" in my files
[2022-12-10 12:08:09] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> crash in 3...2...1.......

[2022-12-10 12:08:13] <%+Ruthbane> the fact that you can see the floor means you need more wands

[2022-12-10 12:08:52] <%+duke1102> 11 hours?
[2022-12-10 12:08:53] <%tw1stf> @Chrawnus My files go alphabetically from "card_unlocked_bomb_holy" to "card_unlocked_destruction"
[2022-12-10 12:08:54] <Chrawnus> @tw1stf hmm, I wonder if card_unlocked_* tells you that you have * unlocked, while action_* tells you that you've cast * then
[2022-12-10 12:09:03] <%WUOTE> @tw1stf the first one is just eqs logic
[2022-12-10 12:09:11] <+Grimhof> Tried Noita, my first death was to polymorph. Turned into some guy with homing rockets, then fired a rocket and turned back to normal and then the rocket locked to me and killed me.

[2022-12-10 12:11:51] <Chrawnus> @tw1stf KEKW but yeah, I THINK it's the sky altar orb, I was gonna suggest you try picking it up again just to see if that fixes the unlock, but you've probably picked that specific orb up countless times already

[2022-12-10 12:14:30] <%WUOTE> @tw1stf @dunkorslam find the directory with orb_07.xml in it, check other files, find the one with EQ it will tell you its location or just check wiki. Go check if you collected the orb
[2022-12-10 12:14:36] <%+Pe4enie> @tw1stf just do another 100% on a new file?

[2022-12-10 12:14:52] <%+chelodau> can you fill the whole screen with wands?
[2022-12-10 12:15:05] <Chrawnus> @tw1stf you could probably add in the flag yourself, just make a file without an extension, name it "card_unlocked_crumbling_earth", and then edit it with a text editor to say "why are you looking here" (without the quotes). Not sure if you need to last part or not, but better be safe than sorry.

[2022-12-10 12:16:08] <Chrawnus> @Stigmund_ they are cheap, and naturally piercing without doing self-damage

[2022-12-10 12:24:56] <%BarbleBapkins> @Grimhof Not enough mana on the wand to cast, but its not taking the add manas into account
[2022-12-10 12:25:20] <%Naicii> just put the heavyshots in the add trigger as well no
[2022-12-10 12:25:22] <%juoffi> also those mods arer in add trigger

[2022-12-10 12:27:14] <%loup675> @DunkOrSlam why not upgrade wand size on other wands?
[2022-12-10 12:28:11] <+Grimhof> If he died there XD
[2022-12-10 12:28:12] <%undercoverunderwear> ChainsawWrapping
[2022-12-10 12:28:17] <%+Arcade812> one way of thinking about add mana is removing 30 mana from the next spell it casts

[2022-12-10 12:46:00] <$DragonfaceX> Lots of good creators hate clickbait titles, but they're kinda forced to because honestly, people click on clickbait titles.
[2022-12-10 12:46:01] <+Maxersace> I clicked on a click bait link and got here.....

[2022-12-10 12:46:04] <%Pagrax> @DunkOrSlam Clickbait means the video content is trash. It doesn't mean a catchy title and thumbnail, it means actively lying and decieving people in your title and not following up in the content.
[2022-12-10 12:46:08] <djlights1> @volymic this is a sane take on it voly
[2022-12-10 12:46:09] <+Grimhof> or "This is a 1/100000 chance"

[2022-12-10 12:46:48] <%Pagrax> @DunkOrSlam So if you make a video "GAME BREAKING WAND", sure, use that title, IF your video has a truly game breaking wand. Not if you name it that and "Look I got a high speed wand that is completely standard"!, that is clickbait.
[2022-12-10 12:46:50] <gtheotter> Yeah there's a huge difference between hyping your vids up and flatout lying
[2022-12-10 12:46:55] <+ListlessOnion> Problem is people click... and that is 1 to 1 money.
[2022-12-10 12:46:58] <MiczuPL> @DunkOrSlam to protest click bait, I click on every one of them and leave a comment slrKEKW
[2022-12-10 12:47:05] <%+Wckdneer> "I tried to do something awesome, but this happened!" <--- these types of videos I ignore on default, if there's no subject in the title, its garbage
[2022-12-10 12:47:14] <+Grimhof> Looking up release dates to games and the pages says it tells you the release date, but its just 3 pages of dog shit

[2022-12-10 13:04:15] <theCheeks> I just add streamers to Chatterino and check the tabs, had never seen your avatar til just now lol
[2022-12-10 13:04:20] <%Its_All_Gone_Wrong> I used to look for the purple colour
[2022-12-10 13:04:28] <volymic> @DunkOrSlam I can't remember who I talked to on discord if they change their avatar
[2022-12-10 13:04:32] <%JefFunk> you could make the avatar hoodie orange
[2022-12-10 13:04:33] <%Its_All_Gone_Wrong> Make it orange and it'll be way more noticeable
[2022-12-10 13:04:42] <%Nifty255> Or you constantly announce ad nauseum over a full month that you're gonna change it.
[2022-12-10 13:04:45] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> your current avatar is cool tho

[2022-12-10 13:05:04] <+ListlessOnion> I didn't watch you in 5 days and filed a complaint against this random channel that suddenly showed up in my follow list! LUL
[2022-12-10 13:05:14] <%+kuba_91> That's true, first what I see are icons, it's faster that way to check which channels are live

[2022-12-10 13:05:17] <Stigmund_> I can't say much, I buy "red drink", thinking it's raspberry or something. Get home and wonder why it tastes awful.
[2022-12-10 13:05:44] <%tw1stf> @volymic it depends on how memorable their name is. For example if their name is "Y" on one channel and their name is "CIA something" on another, I remember them by their avatar
[2022-12-10 13:05:48] <MoroseMonkey> If he announces something every day for multiple years we'll just know that it will never happen. Like, you know, Dunkbot 2.0

[2022-12-10 13:16:55] <%undercoverunderwear> Cheer100 title chat donated this meme 6 times you don't have the upper body, it is easier to build the upper body. You have the upper body and you don't have the legs, you got a problem building the lower body... No, you don't understand. You have the upper body, but you don't have the lower body, you got a problem building downstairs. You got the up- legs on the bottom, it is easier to build on the top, so you don't have much as a problem. Yeah.
