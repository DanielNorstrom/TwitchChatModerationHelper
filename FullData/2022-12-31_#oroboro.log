[2022-12-31 01:03:29] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> hades might fit your playstyle more
[2022-12-31 01:03:36] <%Pogarithmic> Try both bawkStare
[2022-12-31 01:03:37] <blastyoboots> WAIT, there's something important I need to check before you make this decision.
[2022-12-31 01:03:42] <+psykoskream> hades is my fav
[2022-12-31 01:03:46] <blastyoboots> do you know about the Moving Spin Attack?
[2022-12-31 01:03:57] <blastyoboots> the trick where you charge up a spin attack but dash
[2022-12-31 01:04:00] <blastyoboots> instead of letting go

[2022-12-31 01:04:22] <blastyoboots> it's a secret move that the game DOESN'T fucking tell you
[2022-12-31 01:04:27] <blastyoboots> for no reason I can tell
[2022-12-31 01:04:28] <+psykoskream> the spin gets nice with hammer upgrades
[2022-12-31 01:04:35] VIEWERS: 41
[2022-12-31 01:04:42] <blastyoboots> and with Hades aspect's Punishing Sweep it's a PERFECT opening move
[2022-12-31 01:04:46] <%Pogarithmic> There's quite a bit of hidden tech in this game. Super cool to figure out.
[2022-12-31 01:05:08] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> chalupaNODDERS hell yeah
[2022-12-31 01:05:11] <DuoScratch> Aspect of Hades is my favorite spear.
[2022-12-31 01:05:15] <+psykoskream> bigger range too

[2022-12-31 01:05:54] <DuoScratch> Now, put a hammer on that for fast spin charge,a nd you're in the money.

[2022-12-31 01:06:03] <!%Ebonslayer> Spin2Win
[2022-12-31 01:06:05] <+psykoskream> remember that spin upgrade you got with hammer that increased range... its nuts on this aspect
[2022-12-31 01:06:14] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> oroGreed
[2022-12-31 01:06:15] <blastyoboots> that moving spin attack is SO much better than the normal one.  50% more area coverage, MOVES you instead of keeping you stuck in the same damned place to get hit like the normal one.  and then the aspect of hades means you can get EVERY wave of spawning enemies with a global damage multiplier, hot damn.  it's incredible.

[2022-12-31 01:16:27] <%eatingpotatoes25> you would still get the dialouges after win tbh
[2022-12-31 01:16:41] <%Pogarithmic> And your spin does attack damage
[2022-12-31 01:16:46] VIEWERS: 167
[2022-12-31 01:16:47] <!%Ebonslayer> I think the backstab damage is best.
[2022-12-31 01:16:52] <+Xukha> the first one with the special... nasty
[2022-12-31 01:16:57] <%radish_n> The attack bonus applies to your spin too

[2022-12-31 01:18:00] <+Xukha> i don't think the hydra has a back per se but i can be wrong
[2022-12-31 01:18:22] <%radish_n> @radish_n True, but you can build to clear with the spin attack only if you get the proper hammers ^^

[2022-12-31 01:37:38] <%+GIHunter6> Aphrodite would be fat.  Weakness debuff on Attack maybe?

[2022-12-31 01:38:26] <quinix54> aphrodite on attack would be nice
[2022-12-31 01:38:29] <%Pogarithmic> She has the largest percentage increase, but that doesn't mean shit on some weapons if base damage is shit.

[2022-12-31 01:48:37] <%thegreatwhale6969> does that mean minimum range makes it long range but no close range
[2022-12-31 01:48:38] <john_johnsonson> for the way you're using it it might be good

[2022-12-31 01:49:42] <!%Ebonslayer> @Pogarithmic Honestly, I think that's just a side thing right now. This is definitely a throw build.

[2022-12-31 01:51:52] <+psykoskream> its not as good tbh

[2022-12-31 01:52:17] <%Pogarithmic> @ebonslayer oh yeah, then that was definitely the move to pick charged skewer. throw/crit spears are really good, but I mainly just do that with the hidden spear aspect.
[2022-12-31 01:52:18] <!%Ebonslayer> Now we know.
[2022-12-31 01:52:22] <SabreClass> this run might be a rip

[2022-12-31 02:02:00] <%$Flubbernaut> do ittttt
[2022-12-31 02:02:09] <!%Ebonslayer> You need to make long range throws with the charge. If they're at near max range you lose half your damage.
[2022-12-31 02:02:13] <SabreClass> trouble with poseidon stuff is they only get good with the side perks
[2022-12-31 02:02:14] <quinix54> you are good on special dmg already

[2022-12-31 02:04:16] <%+mrtapdawg> agreed. gotta switch to more base attack and less special with this build. the special is for ample time

[2022-12-31 02:16:09] <%radish_n> Since you rely heavily on the special, i doubt PP will do much
[2022-12-31 02:16:10] <%+mrtapdawg> yeah..you're hitting too slow with special right now maybe
[2022-12-31 02:16:14] <+LusciousTigerAss> your AoE would send out a lot of arrows
[2022-12-31 02:16:18] <morsecodec> Yeah. A wash, at best
[2022-12-31 02:16:23] <blastyoboots> Crits do +200% damage 2% of the time... meaning Pressure Points gives 6% more damage overall total.  it sucks.

[2022-12-31 02:44:33] <+psykoskream> based on heat gauge, heat gauge 1 will let you get more blood, diamonds, ambrosia

[2022-12-31 02:44:40] <zehdre> It shows on the pact whether you're elligible for rewards, you'll see it next time
[2022-12-31 02:44:45] <%GoddamnWizard> you can just abandon run with no repercussion, it'll even be the same seed

[2022-12-31 02:44:52] <blastyoboots> Brief explanation:  each time you get the Titan Blood and Diamond and Ambrosia from killing each boss, you only get it once per weapon unless you up the Heat higher each time you earn it

[2022-12-31 02:56:28] <zehdre> @KungFuAndrew As far as roguelikes go this is actually not that hard. You just gotta remember you're making progress every run even if you "lose", since you're getting resources AND story progression every time.
[2022-12-31 02:56:29] <+MackOfHearts> Dont forget to try and talk to Bouldy. Might not be able to yet though

[2022-12-31 03:23:24] <%OptPlaysGames> sounds like I should play the PS3 version sometime. loved the remake
[2022-12-31 03:23:31] <!%Ebonslayer> @mcguinly Agree there. In DS1 and 3 most areas were some variation of city, or town. DS2 has a lot more variety.

[2022-12-31 03:24:04] <%KungFuAndrew> I keep seeing people talking about a DS2 remaster, is that just a rumor at this point?
[2022-12-31 03:24:17] <%KungFuAndrew> yeah, Demon's Souls at 60 is so sexy
[2022-12-31 03:24:23] <zehdre> Once you go 60 you can't go back
[2022-12-31 03:24:28] <+colonelingus> Doom run is the dream?
[2022-12-31 03:24:37] <%Smathane> My old dusty ps3 sounds like its dying eveerytime i fire it up so id rather play the emulator
[2022-12-31 03:24:43] <+Deatheran> dude i JUST got a p[s5 finaly first game i DL is demon souls... i missed out when it was on ps3 and ps5s werre hard to get in canada
[2022-12-31 03:24:43] <%KungFuAndrew> Only problem on the emulated version is it's missing graphics, such as the giant brain. It doesn't appear after you pull all the chains
[2022-12-31 03:24:45] <!%Ebonslayer> @KungFuAndrew I assume everything Fromsoft players say about a remaster, remake or port to be completely bullshit.

[2022-12-31 03:25:06] <zehdre> @KungFuAndrew I believe there are mods being developed to "remaster" it, but I don't think there's anything official
[2022-12-31 03:25:07] <TheEnygma> you excited for Wo Long?
[2022-12-31 03:25:34] <%KungFuAndrew> @KungFuAndrew there's definitely a mod to bring the lighting more on par with the first time the game was revealed

[2022-12-31 03:27:26] <+colonelingus> generally good practice is to focus one 1 to 2 gods and not spread it out too much.
[2022-12-31 03:27:29] <Marshmallum> no it's when he has no DDs

[2022-12-31 03:51:10] <!%$SteampunkRuinN> Two boons might be good

[2022-12-31 03:51:22] <+RagMuffin> the more expensive ones have better rarity
[2022-12-31 03:51:26] <LoonyNo7> anvil + 2 zeus
[2022-12-31 03:51:31] <%$hollowstylist> 450 for one zues strong buy
[2022-12-31 03:51:31] <!%$SteampunkRuinN> 450 one legendary?
[2022-12-31 03:51:34] <dr_landri> Buy expensive Zeus first
[2022-12-31 03:51:35] <rightsidedown> need poms on your attack and special
[2022-12-31 03:51:35] <ArcHeRHooD> GO for better rarity one
[2022-12-31 03:51:50] <+colonelingus> No dps
[2022-12-31 03:51:52] VIEWERS: 685
[2022-12-31 03:51:56] <LoonyNo7> 2 boons is better than one rare boon imo, especially for 150 less
[2022-12-31 03:51:59] <+RagMuffin> there's also opportunity for more gold in Styx rooms
[2022-12-31 03:52:01] <ArcHeRHooD> Maybe get pom then
[2022-12-31 03:52:05] <mcguinly> value
[2022-12-31 03:52:08] <zehdre> I don't think there are any terrible spear hammers anyways
[2022-12-31 03:52:16] <mcguinly> 1 pom 2 zues seems value
[2022-12-31 03:52:16] <!%$SteampunkRuinN> Do it, come back for big zoos?
[2022-12-31 03:52:19] <Cheetodude7> why not see what you get for zeus? might fix
[2022-12-31 03:52:21] <Marshmallum> you could save money for DDs
[2022-12-31 03:52:23] <+RagMuffin> the 300G pom is worth 2 poms
[2022-12-31 03:52:32] <%+ms_p_dorkle> you may get another death def in one of the chambers if you have some pocket money left over
[2022-12-31 03:52:38] <%+cptstabn> you can only try it to find out if its good ro not
[2022-12-31 03:52:44] <mcguinly> lol

[2022-12-31 04:15:58] VIEWERS: 634
[2022-12-31 04:16:09] <%SlamDunkinson> its quite good
[2022-12-31 04:16:15] <LoonyNo7> Priv status is phenomenal, big damage buff from getting things like exposed
[2022-12-31 04:16:18] <+RagMuffin> yeah, one of my favorites
[2022-12-31 04:16:27] <MarcusHash> If you getlucky with boons - it's crazy
[2022-12-31 04:16:28] <%Pogarithmic> Pretty much
[2022-12-31 04:16:28] <Marshmallum> I base all my runs around that
[2022-12-31 04:16:30] <chiyo721> it also amplifies the status condition
[2022-12-31 04:16:34] <LoonyNo7> marked, exposed, chill, poison all work
[2022-12-31 04:16:35] <chiyo721> if it damages
[2022-12-31 04:16:38] <%SlamDunkinson> pretty sure every god has some kind of status effect that can be applied
[2022-12-31 04:16:42] <+RagMuffin> well, its not hard to get access to 2 status effects
[2022-12-31 04:16:44] <%+GIHunter6> One of my favorites is going Fists with Demeter & Dionysus boons
[2022-12-31 04:16:47] <%Pogarithmic> P-status is really good if you plan your build
[2022-12-31 04:16:49] <%+GIHunter6> Stack Frost & Hangover
[2022-12-31 04:16:50] <l_shadow177> oh yeah hades also returns but doesn't wanna talk about the fight cause reasons
[2022-12-31 04:16:58] <DuoScratch> I prefer family favorite. ;p
[2022-12-31 04:17:07] [Notification] roshio7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! [poggers oroJAM]
[2022-12-31 04:17:10] <+RagMuffin> you need Unique gods tho
[2022-12-31 04:17:10] <!%Ebonslayer> More versatile.
[2022-12-31 04:17:14] <LoonyNo7> I prefer priv status, for big damage
[2022-12-31 04:17:18] <faded1896> Its guaranteed damage. The other is a bit more conditional
[2022-12-31 04:17:18] <+degenex27> its easiermbut less damage
[2022-12-31 04:17:20] <+RagMuffin> it's 2.5% per Unique god
[2022-12-31 04:17:23] <chiyo721> Privileged status can be hard sometimes to get going. Sometimes you just don't get gods with reliable status curses like artemis or zeus
[2022-12-31 04:17:26] <Marshmallum> way less damage
[2022-12-31 04:17:37] <LoonyNo7> 2.5% per unique god = only 10% with 4 different gods
[2022-12-31 04:17:37] <%keeran8894> Priv status gives more damage with less gods, however, family favorite is more consistent

[2022-12-31 04:18:00] <chiyo721> In a sense, without knowing the run they're pretty much equal
[2022-12-31 04:18:03] <%Pogarithmic> P-status is much stronger, but you do have to somewhat plan your build.
[2022-12-31 04:18:10] <%Pogarithmic> Both are good tho
[2022-12-31 04:18:11] <MarcusHash> Fam fav is better for chill runs where you don't have a proper build in mind
[2022-12-31 04:18:33] <+degenex27> rare better
[2022-12-31 04:18:34] <%+GIHunter6> Basically less currency, more buffs
[2022-12-31 04:18:36] <%GoddamnWizard> Less rooms with darkness, gems etc
[2022-12-31 04:18:38] <+colonelingus> You can only get 2 hammers per run
[2022-12-31 04:18:38] <LoonyNo7> god boons
[2022-12-31 04:18:41] <%EfraLegend> those are boons
[2022-12-31 04:18:41] <DuoScratch> Boons, hammers, gold, and poms
[2022-12-31 04:18:42] <rightsidedown> it's very good, means you get more god boon rooms
[2022-12-31 04:18:45] <%kdefinition> That's the "Next room" symbol
[2022-12-31 04:18:48] <%Pogarithmic> Dark foresight is amazing
[2022-12-31 04:18:50] <chiyo721> Less currency, more boones, hammers, money and poms
[2022-12-31 04:18:50] <+vrypex> it just means chamber rewards
[2022-12-31 04:18:51] <+RagMuffin> it's basically saying, Less Centaur Hearts, Less Keys, etc
[2022-12-31 04:18:53] <TheEnygma> more fruit, more money, more boons
[2022-12-31 04:19:04] <%Pogarithmic> Crank dem boons and poms
[2022-12-31 04:19:06] <l_shadow177> the hammer upgrades bounty is pain
[2022-12-31 04:19:11] <LoonyNo7> means it's more likely to get god boons etc over meta currency, vs increased rarity when you get them
[2022-12-31 04:19:31] <+degenex27> rares
[2022-12-31 04:19:43] <chiyo721> Dark Foresight is incredibly strong. You get stronger much faster
[2022-12-31 04:19:47] <%Pogarithmic> ^

[2022-12-31 04:20:53] <l_shadow177> the extra casts power is very useful when u put it on a boss to do extra damage
[2022-12-31 04:21:10] <%SlamDunkinson> the zag aspects are typically underwhelming
[2022-12-31 04:21:20] <chiyo721> Sword, achilles spear, any fist, charon bow are all Privileged status weapons
[2022-12-31 04:21:31] <%Pogarithmic> Zag spear isn't great
[2022-12-31 04:21:38] <!%Ebonslayer> Watch you never win again until you switch back to spear.
[2022-12-31 04:21:40] <chiyo721> OH! Zag spear can be hilarious with lambent plume

[2022-12-31 04:27:27] <chiyo721> Zeus attack + fist yes
[2022-12-31 04:27:31] <The_Transparent_Man> zeus into poseidon the bro run
[2022-12-31 04:27:34] <TheEnygma> not on special but fist yeah
[2022-12-31 04:27:44] <!%xperimentalsubject> You only get the boss drops the first time you beat them on a particular Heat level. You can tell by the icons on the left part of the screen when you're viewing the Heat level
[2022-12-31 04:27:45] <chiyo721> Zeus Cast is also always good
[2022-12-31 04:27:47] <%keeran8894> fists with zeus, demetr, hermes
[2022-12-31 04:27:52] <%SlamDunkinson> almost anything can be good with the right build in this game tbh some are just easier to get
[2022-12-31 04:27:55] <%+Teacher_Tim> Best fists are ares and Athena buid
[2022-12-31 04:27:55] <%jigglejuicegamez> if you run AOZ and bloom you can avoid all attacks lmao
[2022-12-31 04:27:56] <khenarthi> anything that procs on hit will be strong
[2022-12-31 04:27:56] <mfsolomon> I usually go demeter artemis on fists
[2022-12-31 04:27:57] <%+ms_p_dorkle> anyone on attack would stack pretty good right ?
[2022-12-31 04:28:01] <%keeran8894> think, anything that would synergize with fasts attacks
[2022-12-31 04:28:01] <l_shadow177> zeus fist, merciful end build fists and drunken fists are great

[2022-12-31 04:28:29] <%SlamDunkinson> stacking doom on fists can be really good if you have dire misfortune and impending doom
[2022-12-31 04:28:49] <l_shadow177> merciful end is a duo boon from ares and athena
[2022-12-31 04:28:50] <%SlamDunkinson> its an ares/athena duo
[2022-12-31 04:28:52] <%Pogarithmic> Merciful End is Ares + Athena. it's been nerfed a ton of times, is still broken
[2022-12-31 04:28:52] <%keeran8894> dyo to quickly stack poisoin, zeus for big DPS in an area, artemis would give a lot of chances for crits, demetr for CC... etc
[2022-12-31 04:29:04] <%+Teacher_Tim> you need Ares on attack, Athena on special and dash.
[2022-12-31 04:29:08] <%+ms_p_dorkle> Artie.. so much critical chance
[2022-12-31 04:29:27] <%+Teacher_Tim> Dash dash dash
[2022-12-31 04:29:28] <%SlamDunkinson> you get doom on attack, and reflect on special and dash
[2022-12-31 04:29:29] <+HeroSparky> Dash
[2022-12-31 04:29:37] <%+Teacher_Tim> Constantly proc doom
[2022-12-31 04:29:40] <l_shadow177> dash shield and normal light doom attack should work
[2022-12-31 04:29:40] <%SlamDunkinson> then impending doom + dire misfortune = win the game
[2022-12-31 04:29:41] <%Pogarithmic> Get the dash. every time you dash, you do stupid damage while also attacking
[2022-12-31 04:29:48] <chiyo721> Doom on quick attack, get athena special for boon enable. Get athena dash and just dash and attack for constant doom combo procs
[2022-12-31 04:29:53] <chiyo721> No, go Zeus
[2022-12-31 04:30:00] <%SlamDunkinson> it takes a lot to set up but its nuts

[2022-12-31 04:30:37] <TarnishedBrand> if you're going for that duo try to avoid other gods so there's less in your pool and you'll be able to prioritize boons

[2022-12-31 04:33:03] <TarnishedBrand> you could have
[2022-12-31 04:33:08] <TarnishedBrand> you can clear like 1/4
[2022-12-31 04:33:09] <l_shadow177> ye zero heat runs if completed with certain weapons best way to farm darkness
[2022-12-31 04:33:14] <TarnishedBrand> ramp up the heat do 1/4

[2022-12-31 04:34:40] <!%Ebonslayer> @TarnishedBrand As strong as chaining on fist though?
[2022-12-31 04:34:41] <chiyo721> fists are always close to danger
[2022-12-31 04:34:44] <SuperEdoto> ares
[2022-12-31 04:34:58] <LoonyNo7> also the zues/ares duo needs revenge boons to be able to appear
[2022-12-31 04:35:01] <TarnishedBrand> @ebonslayer dash builds are meta tbh
[2022-12-31 04:35:14] <TarnishedBrand> if you get jolted and extra dash you can clear
[2022-12-31 04:35:20] <chiyo721> oooo chaos
[2022-12-31 04:35:24] <TarnishedBrand> my record is 9 minutes on heat 55
[2022-12-31 04:35:29] <Marshmallum> revenge on ares could be interesting because you probs will get hit a lot
[2022-12-31 04:35:52] <+silentmoogle> the first time I kill hades was using fist... dash attack to be honest
[2022-12-31 04:36:07] <%Rattlecan_AZ> yah... no reason to magno upper cut to face punch... o.O

[2022-12-31 04:36:53] <!%MadGamer> surly there wont be any traps
[2022-12-31 04:36:54] <TarnishedBrand> you can't attack otherwise and you're building a attack build right
[2022-12-31 04:36:58] <l_shadow177> easy to avoid traps
[2022-12-31 04:37:03] <LoonyNo7> not being able to attack for 3 rooms though
[2022-12-31 04:37:10] <TarnishedBrand> you're nerfed for the next 3 rounds and might fight boss
