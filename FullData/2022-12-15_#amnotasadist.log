[2022-12-15 23:06:21] <klyyrisa> @kirazekizu89 Most of the cards that create dice outside of the resonance cards require an investment of dice first. Paimon for example is 3 of one die type, for 4 omni over two turns. You basically preorder dice for later turns.

[2022-12-15 23:08:41] <PlusYun> for an oceanid-barbara team what do you recommend as the third character? heal stall summon is the goal, kinda indecisive rn
[2022-12-15 23:08:49] <klyyrisa> @PlusYun Standard attacks, it's the burst that's powerful. When you use a skill his effect is based on hp. 6 or less heals you for 2, 7 or more deals an extra 2 damage.
[2022-12-15 23:08:59] <moist4sammy> The 2 heal card?
[2022-12-15 23:09:12] <%atkam2018> @MigueC21 if we do there wont be profit
