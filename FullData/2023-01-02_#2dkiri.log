[2023-01-02 13:39:20] <%Hibikime> i guess they have a little bit of wiggle room if they're chained to keep themselves alive? maybe?
[2023-01-02 13:39:48] <%fanyogs> A chain allows 1 tile movement around it. That way you can place ammenities and nescecities near them. They can feed themselves and it keeps their mood high. Thus not throwing tantrums down the line... or at least a lot less likely to throw one
[2023-01-02 13:39:55] <%Hibikime> but purely rp/aesthetically speaking cages would be way more MUAHAHAHAHA
[2023-01-02 13:40:06] <%fanyogs> Once they are in a cage they are entirely reliant on other dwarves to feed them

[2023-01-02 14:39:12] <Pagrax> @grugenvids The sign of a good simulation, that it allows for non-intended emergent events. It's such a deep game that at times I find myself referencing Wikipedia to understand concepts for DF.

[2023-01-02 14:43:56] <MABarrack> I'm currently undertaking a project of mining out a few Z levels and then dropping water (via channels and hatches). I'm trying to create my own, safe, cavern-wood farm
[2023-01-02 14:44:27] <darxzan> all normal items you have should be item list
[2023-01-02 14:44:41] <drumgoesboom> I saw u-bends recommended. down hatch gets destroyed often but they rarely destroy hatch back up.
[2023-01-02 14:44:48] <Pagrax> I believe that shows ones currently worn as well, but not 100% on that.
[2023-01-02 14:44:58] <darxzan> you can melt them and redo until you get better quality item

[2023-01-02 14:48:40] <Pagrax> Dwarf Fortress inspired Fortnite, even. It has such far reaching influence on games we play these days.

Iron makes kills easier when they aren't very good, and then save iron bolts for real danger and hunt with bone bolts so they need to get better to have success killing the average and minor creatures.

[2023-01-02 15:01:21] <Pagrax> @Neroxen_ I'd be interested in more nutrition and temperature being relevant. But even just cutting how much is grown per tile by a good bit would make it somewhat nicer. It just always feels silly to have a giant fort but really only need like 20 dwarves for all the jobs.

[2023-01-02 16:41:21] <Graknorke> yeah there's a kind of rock called claystone

[2023-01-02 17:23:20] <macnme123> Libraries are a meeting area where dwarves will gather to have intellectual discussions, and to write and copy recorded knowledge.
[2023-01-02 17:23:22] <AlterEgo1101> I think citizens will also write things in the library if you provide them with parchment and such.
[2023-01-02 17:23:37] <%Elarcis> They do!

[2023-01-02 17:24:00] <rubinowitz> @2DKiri roads have to be deconstructed manually sadly
[2023-01-02 17:24:03] <%Elarcis> You have an involved process to create scrolls, but then scholars come to your fortress to share knowledge and read what your dwarves write
[2023-01-02 17:24:05] <AlterEgo1101> Roads are a construction, like a workshop, but floors are just one tile

[2023-01-02 17:24:58] <+Chaz8591> So Kiri, Floor takes more material than road, because floor doesn't need anything below it. It can be hanging off a wall for example.

[2023-01-02 17:47:53] <AlterEgo1101> I learned a cool tip about goblin snatchers. If you tie an animal, like a pig or a goose, to a rope outside your door they will detect stealth units.
[2023-01-02 17:48:08] <pichin75> You can follow them using the camera icon.

[2023-01-02 17:49:56] <AlterEgo1101> @Melvinofiets I believe that is correct. Any animal that does not graze will work. If they are a grazing animal and they are tied up they will tragically starve to death.

[2023-01-02 17:53:56] <AlterEgo1101> I don't think the animal traps will catch the thiefs. I think you need a regular cage trap to catch snatchers.

[2023-01-02 17:54:24] <Graknorke> cage traps yeah
[2023-01-02 17:54:26] <AlterEgo1101> You only catch vermin with animal traps

[2023-01-02 17:57:54] <%$Panderrific> your dwarves know the traps are there and dont set them off (unless they fall/stumble)
[2023-01-02 17:58:01] <oldbeans_> you should never ask a giant frog it's weight
[2023-01-02 17:58:06] <+MisterAvry> giant cave tooads are 200,00cm cubed max according to the wiki
[2023-01-02 17:58:16] VIEWERS: 413
[2023-01-02 17:58:21] <pichin75> Pressure plates can be linked like leavers. You can see wights in the pressure plate setting once you construct them.
[2023-01-02 17:58:27] <!%RezaDarkside> is it wiki time?
[2023-01-02 17:58:29] <+MisterAvry> dwarf max is 60k
[2023-01-02 17:59:01] <+MisterAvry> so your average cave toad is about 1.8 dwarves

[2023-01-02 17:59:10] <AlterEgo1101> The wiki says that Dwarves, Goblins, Elves and Humans all weigh about the same, at about 60 kg
[2023-01-02 17:59:18] <+MisterAvry> according to "mid" range
[2023-01-02 17:59:35] <kippawah> The agreement resets, once they show up, and it will nto show the aggreement until they leave the map again, I believe
[2023-01-02 17:59:38] <pichin75> You can't see agreements once caravan arrive.

[2023-01-02 18:00:40] <AlterEgo1101> It would be neat to make a trap that could only be set off by Cave Toads. Like a water source that washes the toad back out into the caverns when it steps on a pressure plate. I wonder if that is possible

[2023-01-02 18:02:14] <pichin75> Unlike leavers, pressure plates switch on and off only when somebody is on the plate.

[2023-01-02 18:11:33] <AlterEgo1101> @Shagiwog Have you tried a Build a Bolt workshop? Just a Crafting workshop with a perpetual bolt job that lets everyone make wooden or bone bolts just to get their crafting itch satisfied.
[2023-01-02 18:11:35] <%Canslli> Oh, nvm
[2023-01-02 18:11:37] <%$Panderrific> yeah they all want to craft so much, but you already have 10 bins of each craft type, and the traders never bring enough to trade
[2023-01-02 18:11:57] <+MisterAvry> @oldbeans_ does that work? you used to be able to assign it as part of their outfit
[2023-01-02 18:11:59] <%Shagiwog> @alterego1101 that's a good idea, always need more bolts

[2023-01-02 18:13:21] <AlterEgo1101> @oldbeans_ I have seen the work arounds for the bolt bug. Make sure they have quivers, and the bolts have to be in a stockpile with NO BINS and only one type of ammo.
[2023-01-02 18:13:24] <+AvatarGW> they won't grab it from bins

[2023-01-02 18:45:13] <%Elarcis> You need a quern, a screw press, plants to mash into a slurry, a workshop to make scroll rollers, then you need to press the slurry into paper and combine it with the rollers to make scrolls
[2023-01-02 18:45:15] <erislover> thankfully you don't need much
[2023-01-02 18:45:20] <%Elarcis> Though honestly I found it easier than SOAP.

[2023-01-02 18:46:14] <crundlematic> quern is a unpowered millstone. millstones are faster but need mechanical power
[2023-01-02 18:46:14] <KoersiP> @RezaDarkside I am way beyond that, I have narrowed issue down to androind system messages disturbing internet connection specifically
[2023-01-02 18:46:19] <%Elarcis> In the end I had a soap setup so radical that the dwarves started to make forgotten beast soap by themselves.

[2023-01-02 18:46:43] <AlterEgo1101> @Elarcis Soap is rough. The real difficulty is making sure your kitchen isn't cooking tallow, and you have to deselect every single type of tallow.
[2023-01-02 18:46:44] <%Elarcis> It probably smells like lavender and trauma.

[2023-01-02 18:47:10] <KoersiP> killing the process of system messages worked for while until system rebooted itself and nothing I can do about that
[2023-01-02 18:47:14] <%Elarcis> @Elarcis I just disabled yak tallow, since that’s what I used to make the soap
