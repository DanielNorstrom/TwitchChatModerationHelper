[2022-12-31 19:23:12] <%br4nd0nh347> Even if the MMO is a regular standard MMO it will be amazing, because of Ruenterra
[2022-12-31 19:23:13] <s3aberry> their main game has 2 different types of players thats why its hard to balacne
[2022-12-31 19:23:17] <izzy_ix> @sassanid27 not Val

[2022-12-31 19:23:33] <Hermganksyou> @Sukami87 its 2 completely different dev teams. also balance of 200 champs is harder than an mmo
[2022-12-31 19:23:35] <!%hossxox> @Onubin ty for that btw
[2022-12-31 19:23:35] <%LetheTheForgetfulRiver> Their main game also has like, 10 million different things to balance KEKL
[2022-12-31 19:23:46] <+BigBen299> league is the money hog for their other games, i would expect the mmo to at least be pretty decent with all their lux money
[2022-12-31 19:23:49] <%TotallyNotACopBro> Riot MMO will come out 2023 Copeless
[2022-12-31 19:23:50] <%LetheTheForgetfulRiver> Can you imagine actually trying to balance this shit? Real talk

[2022-12-31 19:25:14] <+Sukami87> @Hermganksyou Different dev teams i can see working. Balancing 200 champs isn't quite as hard as you probably think. Most champs use the same mechanics or debuffs as a whole. Just need to tweak values really.
