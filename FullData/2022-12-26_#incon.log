[2022-12-26 17:57:37] <@%$air2jodran3> I still don't understand why they introduced Glyphs and then just never expanded on it
[2022-12-26 17:57:41] <%+CaspeyGhost> Yeah, but it's still going. And that's something.
[2022-12-26 17:58:45] <%+CaspeyGhost> One day it'll just be Incon and his chat, keeping Smite alive.
[2022-12-26 17:58:45] <%siv0r> They introduced like... 3 other glyphs. could've made virtually every t3 item have a glyph. Huge balance swings potentially. way more interesting
[2022-12-26 17:58:45] <%+SalaComMander> Didn't this season start off strong, though? Or am I getting it mixed up with last season because time is an illusion? inconOhNo

[2022-12-26 17:59:02] <%Debaucherous> I'll be honest.. sometimes it feels like even HiRez is surprised and just wants to fulfill expectations by killing it. I hope it changes with S10
