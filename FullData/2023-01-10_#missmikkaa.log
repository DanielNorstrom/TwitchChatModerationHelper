[2023-01-10 17:44:25] <Saftanka> One question. I read about a toplist on fragbite on top swedish streamers where the woman on top had like 44000 hours streamed at december. How do they count those hours streamed? If 10 people watch your stream for 6 hour one day is that 60 hours streamed? Cause if that is the case you should be number one on that toplist?

[2023-01-10 17:50:37] <Saftanka> One question. I read about a toplist on fragbite on top swedish streamers where the woman on top had like 44000 hours streamed at december. How do they count those hours streamed? If 10 people watch your stream for 6 hour one day is that 60 hours streamed? Cause if that is the case you should be number one on that toplist?

[2023-01-10 22:48:58] <@%^y0shi_b0t> The beggar spies just informed us that the Imperial guards seem to have lowered their security. Now would be a perfect time for the Thieves Guild to strike! Type "!heist <betting amount>.
