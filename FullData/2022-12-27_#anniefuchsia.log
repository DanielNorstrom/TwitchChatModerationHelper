[2022-12-27 13:47:02] <%Taylor131313> After completing the entire Engine of Innovation Questline and earning all 5 Sparks, you will be able to earn additional Bottled Essence from any activity within the Dragon Isles; however, they are meant to be rare. Finding Sparks are comparable to the old Legion Legendary system to those who are familiar.
[2022-12-27 13:47:02] <%Geoffku> they'll still be a rare drop I think

[2022-12-27 13:48:01] <%Hezmund> it's the only gripe I have with the current crafting system, the fact that if you didn't spam crafting orders early on you can't get 100 skill without 20+ renown

[2022-12-27 13:53:05] <%Hezmund> @AnnieFuchsia I don't mind the gear being timegated, it's the fact i can't get 100 skill in my main proffession because I didn't spam orders for people the first week, no-one does public orders now because they want guaranteed R5 (which i can't do as i'm not 100 skill)
[2022-12-27 13:53:13] <%Taylor131313> nah it's fine

[2022-12-27 16:46:34] <@%skibbatv> @moriartiphd I recommend repairing game files and checking integrity, then disabling all addons. See if it still persists

[2022-12-27 20:48:36] <%Sepulchair> Shattering Impact. What I use to do whenever he casts that, is to run away from the boss. That way the pools will be dropped further away

[2022-12-27 21:00:56] <%Boreall> you guys can be minimizing damage a lot more too, it helps if you set two places to group for each quarter of the room. On the right side of each quarter, you stack pillars, on the left side of each quarter stack you have the AoE that you move back from. Then, when he destroys the quarter of the room, you barely have to move (but move to your left) and you're on the right side of the new quarter to stack pillars there

[2022-12-27 21:30:19] <%vendettaw0w> Evoker is amazing but hard to master because of shorter range and "cone healing"
[2022-12-27 21:30:53] <Kuulll> Oh ya, I noticed the cone healing. I'm 99% of the time healer main. So was thinking of switching it up a bit.
[2022-12-27 21:30:53] <%Boreall> Evoker healer has a very high skill floor and even higher skill ceiling
[2022-12-27 21:31:05] <%OJ_Hype> yeah thats not good at all

[2022-12-27 21:37:27] <%Kilrathal> why 80th?

[2022-12-27 21:37:51] <%Kilrathal> just delete 20% of the population Pepega
[2022-12-27 21:38:12] <%nastye> because this group is more of an 80th percentile group than a rank 1 gorup
[2022-12-27 21:38:32] <%nastye> https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/31#dataset=95&boss=2639 oddly enough 95th percentile outlaw is still ahead
[2022-12-27 21:38:32] <%whizakaz> I hate it nastye because it feels more like warrior than rogue ^^
[2022-12-27 21:38:33] <%nastye> anyways
[2022-12-27 21:38:33] <%OJ_Hype> put me in coach Pepega /

[2022-12-27 21:39:14] <%nastye> @Kilrathal so 80th percentile is too bad but rank 1 is too good? monkaHmm
[2022-12-27 21:39:17] <%whizakaz> Nah not my thing ^^
[2022-12-27 21:39:23] <%Sne4ky79> anniesHmm
[2022-12-27 21:39:25] <%Kilrathal> @nastye so you're reason is bad. there is a reason wowhead uses 95th percentile as it shows the best and worst exclusing the extrema
[2022-12-27 21:39:25] <%whizakaz> I enjoy assa too much to switch ^^
[2022-12-27 21:39:31] <%Kilrathal> but yes outlaw =wannabe fury warrior

[2022-12-27 22:36:40] <%drzaius30> pretty sure every stream i ever opened that has had music playing outside of game i have immediately closed LUL
[2022-12-27 22:37:01] <%PanicRush> the saddest thing is m+ vault will still be higher ilvl than hc raid
[2022-12-27 22:37:09] <%PanicRush> even though i only did 13s
[2022-12-27 22:38:06] <%Morgonbladet> ye heroic is only good for tmp upgrades
[2022-12-27 22:38:08] <%Wardrick7> it can give rare drops from raid with higher ilvl
[2022-12-27 22:38:15] <%Morgonbladet> not vault but boss loot
[2022-12-27 22:38:31] <%PanicRush> how much higher are they?
[2022-12-27 22:38:38] <%PanicRush> like that rare ring and trinket?
[2022-12-27 22:38:39] <%Taylor131313> I feel like heroic raid hasn't been relevant since titanforging gone if you do 15s eventually
[2022-12-27 22:38:40] <%Wardrick7> depends on boss
[2022-12-27 22:38:50] <%PanicRush> ring from 1st boss and trinket from council
[2022-12-27 22:38:52] <%Taylor131313> I think it's +6 ilvl
[2022-12-27 22:38:54] <%Wardrick7> 408
[2022-12-27 22:39:00] <%Wardrick7> from coucil trinket
[2022-12-27 22:39:07] <%PanicRush> so thats the same ilvl as +13 m+ vault
[2022-12-27 22:39:10] <%Wardrick7> ring same
[2022-12-27 22:39:11] <%Taylor131313> the ring from 2nd last boss is 418
