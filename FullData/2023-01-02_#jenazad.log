[2023-01-02 05:20:53] <inferno2918> @Jenazad but one thing tho, they said "talking" in the tittle b4 it started, so i think the blame might be on SG, cause no way they tell them to play the game and they straight up did something else
[2023-01-02 05:20:55] <sufferingfromaya> Messed what up?

[2023-01-02 05:23:59] <%DropIt69> lets be honest this game new player experience is dogsht
[2023-01-02 05:24:10] <Amurensy> but she didn't played the game, did she?
[2023-01-02 05:24:15] <!%PotatoesHUH> @Leahzar kronii and kiara were supposed to do a sponsored stream for e7 and kiara didnt show up ok
[2023-01-02 05:24:17] VIEWERS: 167
[2023-01-02 05:24:21] <%mugenlion> She is always like that

[2023-01-02 05:24:29] <%akshandiff_> jenaYAAY
[2023-01-02 05:24:31] <inferno2918> i still dont get why E7 would pay them to talk about the game instead of showing it, the MAIN point of E7 is the gameplay, the animations, if they dont even show it then wtf @Jenazad
[2023-01-02 05:24:38] <%bob_kappa_ross_> YAAY hey guys
[2023-01-02 05:24:38] <raimayetrix> e7 experience for new players is very good actually
[2023-01-02 05:24:43] <raimayetrix> compared to other games
[2023-01-02 05:24:46] <%itsvulop> @PotatoesHUH wait wtf, that mustve breached some contract or smtn

[2023-01-02 05:25:22] <ThirteenLantern> early game e7 is good, mid game to end game is hell KEKW
[2023-01-02 05:25:23] <LeocoyP> Are you hungover jena?
[2023-01-02 05:25:25] <%ImPierone> yeah esp cuz i started in pandemic there was so much stuff to do it was a good distraction ok
[2023-01-02 05:25:26] <%DropIt69> the gear the farm, the characters at some point its overwhelming
[2023-01-02 05:25:27] <LeocoyP> If not then drink more stare
[2023-01-02 05:25:34] <raimayetrix> i like the many stuff, plus it's organized so it doesn't feel as overwhelming honestly

[2023-01-02 05:25:44] <+Baetora> yeah why play a game like e7 in the first place if you dont like the grind

Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2023-01-02 06:46:41] <%ML_Zahhak> shes just a menace to deal with, pick her like a support dps.  her dps is B, her tankyness is A, her speed is B+.  If you draft an all tanky team with her as an anchor you feel kind of helpless

[2023-01-02 06:47:13] <+Behthoven> When did Yulha become meta
[2023-01-02 06:47:20] <JoeK5> so is it worth having two of Karina's artifacts or just one at +30?
[2023-01-02 06:47:22] <+Giantrex> !Yulha
[2023-01-02 06:47:22] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3
[2023-01-02 06:47:23] <%ML_Zahhak> anti DJB tech for awhile

[2023-01-02 10:35:13] <%Shirousa> @barald POV if she's squish, bastion if you're lacking ER, ice crystals for more heal, water's origin for lower speed/desire more cycling

[2023-01-02 10:50:50] <%zlrenyth> they should have sponsored forsen instead AngryArthur

[2023-01-02 10:50:56] <Tig3rKnee> was the song just bad or something?
[2023-01-02 10:51:19] <inferno2918> its the singer
[2023-01-02 10:51:26] <Z4G4TO> i agree the song
[2023-01-02 10:51:34] <nyxxlul> i think they got kronii just because she knows korean ICANT
[2023-01-02 10:51:35] <Z4G4TO> the song is not it for me

[2023-01-02 10:51:49] <%mugenlion> It's E7 Chrismas's song
[2023-01-02 10:51:49] <%Vyrka_> should have done the wc ost BASED
[2023-01-02 10:51:51] <valkyr89> its not the pacing. the words like so long din fit the rythm
[2023-01-02 10:51:59] <inferno2918> kiara songs arent that good except for the one she did with ina same for kronni
[2023-01-02 10:51:59] <Z4G4TO> should just cover promise or something else

[2023-01-02 11:40:35] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2023-01-02 15:20:32] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.
