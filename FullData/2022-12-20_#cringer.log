[2022-12-20 15:22:03] <%R3voked> It all relies on lowering the laser energy cost.
[2022-12-20 15:22:18] <LazyChairGamer> and sustaining longer
[2022-12-20 15:22:21] <%Jencey86> 1.5 energy gain is pretty good
[2022-12-20 15:22:33] <LazyChairGamer> 1.5....thats just the START..damn

[2022-12-20 15:22:45] <wombat_medik> they also made the mention that the tritium was enough to carry for less than 2 years currently for what tritium is in stock
[2022-12-20 15:22:53] <DijegoDev> And it doesn't use any finite fuel?
[2022-12-20 15:23:02] <LazyChairGamer> it fuses elements together

[2022-12-20 15:23:42] <LazyChairGamer> only down side is if we make a small fusion plant go supernovqa......
[2022-12-20 15:23:43] <SimonSez> Great success
[2022-12-20 15:23:54] <%FlareSN> @DijegoDev it has a startup cost but once its running its basically self sustaining
[2022-12-20 15:23:57] <Gniwii> @Cringer sure cause it too 20 years to get all the lasers tuned sure
[2022-12-20 15:23:59] <shiny_bauble> Sweet.  If this rate of gain keeps going, we'll explode the earth in a few years!
[2022-12-20 15:24:00] <%FlareSN> in theory
[2022-12-20 15:24:09] <DijegoDev> @r3voked nice
[2022-12-20 15:24:23] <+Durabull> not 1.6 times but 300 times to make it efficicent
[2022-12-20 15:24:26] <LazyChairGamer> i knew lasers were the answer
[2022-12-20 15:24:29] <%Jencey86> LUL all the lasers
[2022-12-20 15:24:33] <%+trikk_star> More EFFICIENT Lazers!

[2022-12-20 15:25:00] <Barrh> sharks with fricken laser beams attachd to their heads
[2022-12-20 15:25:00] <+Durabull> the lazer startup uses 298.4x the energy produced
[2022-12-20 15:25:01] <LazyChairGamer> so its ACTGUALLY 30 yrs away now

[2022-12-20 15:25:24] <%Jencey86> Oh yeah, we won't see it on a wide scale for a long time, but that's great news for the next generations cringeNOD
[2022-12-20 15:25:29] <LazyChairGamer> yup, its always 30 yrs away
[2022-12-20 15:25:36] <%R3voked> Its great but we dont even use the free energy that we can easily harness now LUL
[2022-12-20 15:25:41] <LazyChairGamer> good thing we're still experimenting
[2022-12-20 15:25:44] <%FlareSN> 60 years is literally nothing lma
[2022-12-20 15:25:50] <%FlareSN> in the grand scheme of things
[2022-12-20 15:26:02] <wombat_medik> I have a YT link for the fusion thing...May I post it to chat? @Cringer and Mods?
[2022-12-20 15:26:03] <LazyChairGamer> and miniturize it!
[2022-12-20 15:26:03] <%djaggie> Dammit science, science faster
[2022-12-20 15:26:09] <%FlareSN> it would be the most ground breaking discovery in human history, 60 years would be so worth it
[2022-12-20 15:26:10] <LazyChairGamer> need more tech
[2022-12-20 15:26:13] <%R3voked> Its many times hotter than the sun D: dont even want to think about if shit goes wrong
[2022-12-20 15:26:21] <SimonSez> And I'm saying yt's another 30-50 years away from being a product
[2022-12-20 15:26:26] <Deadly_Chicken> that's gg in scientific jargon
[2022-12-20 15:26:26] <@%$Everleigh> Humans are impatient AF
[2022-12-20 15:26:41] <LazyChairGamer> yay i'll die as it comes out
[2022-12-20 15:26:42] <%djaggie> @R3voked high temperatures in that small an area are no concern.
[2022-12-20 15:26:49] <The_Sp1d3r> I'm suprised the iol industry is letting it happen

[2022-12-20 15:26:51] <%Jencey86> Most of us probably won't see it on a large scale in our lifetimes, but that's okay

[2022-12-20 15:57:29] <%$k_nord> “The site” which one.
[2022-12-20 15:57:41] [Notification] J0rmunn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! [bork bork]
[2022-12-20 15:57:47] <Spartan_0214> Is that how GUI/UX is these days? As soon as something goes wrong, go somewhere else?
[2022-12-20 15:57:59] <SimonSez> And if you click "create account" now it will make you choose a server
[2022-12-20 15:58:34] <Spartan_0214> I think that's intended with Mastodon, b/c it's like joining a game server and making an account there
[2022-12-20 15:58:39] <%Weasel598> Mastodon is a little tricky to navigate via the application, but it seems a little better via browser
[2022-12-20 15:58:51] <%+wikes60> and the barrier to entry is hopefully the benefit to avoid the bots that twitter has.
[2022-12-20 15:59:08] <%+MtMan> I'm only half paying attention, why does it sound like you're giving tech support to my 70 year old mom/

[2022-12-20 15:59:40] <Spartan_0214> it's less a barrier to entry and more a different mentality for social interaction. Rather than one main account, it's an account per server for each community you want to be a part of
[2022-12-20 16:00:19] <@%+Shottymonster> im currently trying to pressure cook a joint of gammon in dr pepper for xmas n ting
[2022-12-20 16:00:26] <%FlareSN> ah the good ol days of alien blue for reddit back in middle school, gotta love unofficial apps
[2022-12-20 16:00:49] <+northernsky> can you only see feeds from that server? Will I see your feeds?
[2022-12-20 16:01:15] <%trivialmind> Gammon... sheep? goat?
[2022-12-20 16:01:16] <$Elswyn> gammon is uncooked ham
[2022-12-20 16:01:17] <knightjudicator> it both is harder and isn't. it's not a twitter replacement and shouldn't be advertised as such; that makes people expect something they are not going to get
[2022-12-20 16:01:18] <+northernsky> Sorry I know you've explained this already x400

[2022-12-20 16:01:30] <%$k_nord> But it’s a good thing that not everyone can/will use it, maybe they will have less negative in their life
[2022-12-20 16:01:32] <%Shi__Nobi> think its because Twtitter, IG, etc, you pick a server and you cant move, your stuck. And thats been engrained on people
[2022-12-20 16:01:39] <@%+Shottymonster> @Elswyn thats the one
[2022-12-20 16:01:41] <$Elswyn> cook a gammon to make a ham
[2022-12-20 16:02:04] <KangaRoobit> Explain interwebs to me Cringer how make work
[2022-12-20 16:02:08] <knightjudicator> @Shi__Nobi you could not move mastodon servers for a while--you can now migrate accounts, used to need separate ones
[2022-12-20 16:02:09] <SimonSez> I'm on Fosstodon
[2022-12-20 16:02:09] <@%+Shottymonster> but you can cook it in different things to get different flavours
[2022-12-20 16:02:22] <%FlareSN> is there a cooldown after switching servers or can you jump around as much as you want?
[2022-12-20 16:02:31] <$Todd_the_Wraith> so mastodon is basically Twitter + Discord had a baby?
[2022-12-20 16:02:34] <%Shi__Nobi> @Shi__Nobi I know. But thats not today

[2022-12-20 18:08:07] <noniyuh> it's not bad news for the folks who only come in halfway through stream, at least
[2022-12-20 18:08:18] <%$k_nord> must click on Done, I have "right clicked" a few times to exit the screen and it didn't save.
[2022-12-20 18:08:32] <+Nethlek151> let's not forget forgotten beasts either
[2022-12-20 18:08:36] <Prototype958> I'll go out and fight an ettin. When it's a werebeast I bunker up and wait for it to leave
[2022-12-20 18:08:37] <shunoshi> Yeah, minutes played saves would be much better than game time. I'm paused constantly.
[2022-12-20 18:09:33] <%+trikk_star> Biggest issue I see with more frequent saves is that this game takes a bit to save.
