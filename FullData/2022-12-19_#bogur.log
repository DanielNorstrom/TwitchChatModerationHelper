[2022-12-19 04:07:36] <Zog_irl> try making it so when you cut to the bottom view it's initially zoomed in, then zooms out slowly
[2022-12-19 04:07:44] <Zog_irl> like where you barely see the edges of the well at first
[2022-12-19 04:08:51] <Zog_irl> maybe a faster zoom out, but since we can't hear music can't tell how the vibe is

[2022-12-19 07:24:24] <ffeelipeee> Why is the queue so long?
[2022-12-19 07:24:37] <blake_585> Hello

[2022-12-19 07:24:52] <tinytreee> Take a shot every time someone asks about the queue challenge
[2022-12-19 07:24:57] <TryMyWagon> which servers are you on..?
[2022-12-19 07:25:08] <%MOSSUP> NA servers
[2022-12-19 07:25:17] <i_i_capn_crunch> Its probably server i think right? The reason for long queue
[2022-12-19 07:25:24] <TheSushiHero> Well timed music lol
[2022-12-19 07:25:27] <%MOSSUP> i know exactly why, overwatch :D

[2022-12-19 07:26:02] <ffeelipeee> Kinda rude lol, the answer i was expecting is like because of your high rank so there are less people you can be matched with
[2022-12-19 07:26:07] VIEWERS: 555
[2022-12-19 07:26:15] <foxhound52> okay i was looking around twitch and twitter to see if anyone was having queue problems like me and i think this pretty much answers it
[2022-12-19 07:26:29] <tinytreee> So you already knew the answer lol
[2022-12-19 07:26:30] <!%STARTKLARRR> did you play sim city 4 bogur
[2022-12-19 07:26:30] <+squeezefresh> The Pharah from earlier must have control of the servers.

[2022-12-19 11:40:39] <%+ChrisTheRookey> I wouldn't even be surprised if Ranked was this dead. The quality in QP matches skyrocketed lately. Still went like 3-9 yesterday, but games were better than Comp.

[2022-12-19 11:54:10] <moustache_rekt1999> Having a W/L record probably the only way to know if you're gonna rank up now

[2022-12-19 13:43:51] <%ChrisTheRookey> Honestly, disable this ass hero. Just say you found a bug and take him out of the game.
[2022-12-19 13:43:52] <Xelaire> at least decrease the distance his hook can go.  I feel like he has way too far of a reach sometimes.

[2022-12-19 13:44:32] <moustache_rekt1999> and then doom became fun to play and get gutted in a week

[2022-12-19 13:45:57] <moustache_rekt1999> @varganovgo i guess but it's crazy to me that it only took ONE WEEK for them to nerf him
[2022-12-19 13:46:08] <%ChrisTheRookey> I find it funny how ppl thought the hook rework was teased in Hog's new highlight intro.

[2022-12-19 13:47:03] <moustache_rekt1999> the only thing keeping me from uninstalling overwatch is widow's ass
[2022-12-19 13:47:28] <Friedolf> Hog rework was promised for January, so perhaps there is hope
[2022-12-19 13:47:33] <%ChrisTheRookey> Hog player's best argument whenever Hog gets accused of being broken is "When you nerf him like in OW1, he becomes unplayable". First off all, good! He shouldn't be played. Second of all, that was OW1. 6v6 and CC.

[2022-12-19 16:07:12] <+kettlez> Elgato you can use it to set macros, an it's got a screen, I believe they also have mixers
[2022-12-19 16:07:12] <@%+Zenxis> Yeah I'm sure you can make something else for way cheaper
[2022-12-19 16:07:18] <%buba_ow> yeah but they look fancy

[2022-12-19 16:08:08] <+kettlez> Elgato Stream deck could be useful, especially considering your viewership

[2022-12-19 16:08:48] <@%+Zenxis> It would honestly be way cooler and more profitable if you make your own - you can make a video out of it and stream it

[2022-12-19 16:10:01] <moustache_rekt1999> @sassylin Ana's really good against ramattra because of how support reliant he is. The problem of course is Kiriko being to completely deny him. Think of Ana into Ramattra as Ana into Hog
[2022-12-19 16:10:12] <@%+Zenxis> Bogur Pokemon Stream would be WICKED

[2022-12-19 16:10:41] <DapperSolem> mario kart when ur hanging out with friends is actually the most top tier thing ever

[2022-12-19 16:10:45] <%LauSVM> You can play Overwatch on Switch while in queue LUL
[2022-12-19 16:10:48] <%Thevrex> on switch, id say np
[2022-12-19 16:10:49] <%katmosk> i think arcues is the best pokemon one
[2022-12-19 16:10:51] <@%+Zenxis> There are a lot of Pkmn games you can play on emulators but newer ones past like Black and White 2 are on the DS/Switch
[2022-12-19 16:10:52] <+kettlez> Zelda, Mario, Smash, splatoon
[2022-12-19 16:10:58] <!%Emil0823> the only interesting game for switch is Mario odyssey
[2022-12-19 16:10:58] <%+DapperSolem> like genuinely i think a switch is worth it alone for playing mario kart with ur friends

[2022-12-19 16:11:48] <@%+Zenxis> I bought the Destiny PS4 edition but servers were so fucked it kept resetting my progress so I sold that shit
[2022-12-19 16:11:55] <%LauSVM> PS5 seems not worth if you have a good PC
[2022-12-19 16:11:55] <%+munez_ow> the new one i mean
[2022-12-19 16:11:55] <+kettlez> PS5 holds their exclusivity titles for far longer than they should
[2022-12-19 16:11:58] <!%Emil0823> best way to play switch is to emulate it on Steam deck
[2022-12-19 16:12:00] <moustache_rekt1999> God of war ragnarok is badass but if you're not interested in it don't buy a ps5

[2022-12-19 16:57:33] <%EyreOW> when in reality you can alleviate a lot of stress by just listening to them. Or paying attention. Like they are grabbing at their diaper well maybe it needs to be changed again even though you changed them 5 minutes ago. They are holding their empty juice cup but do not know the word for it yet but if you ask do you want more juice they will run into the kitchen instead of whining.
