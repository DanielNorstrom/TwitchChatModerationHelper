[2023-01-09 11:44:34] <+thedottiegman> Especially if you’re famous
[2023-01-09 11:44:39] <+alfaixx> if you live with someone it can be recognized as marriage in court
[2023-01-09 11:44:43] <%sekcaJ> In my country you don't have to get married for a divorce. If you can prove 5 years of living together as a couple, you are "married" to the state

[2023-01-09 12:00:31] <FLIPFLAP2222> @FLIPFLAP2222 itd make no sense; its a looooong time. they were roomates for years before they even wanted to be together
[2023-01-09 12:00:39] <biodinosaur> In my country if you get married your partner and you split the stuff you got since not before the marrige HmmNotes
[2023-01-09 12:00:42] <+alfaixx> xqc's divorce will be finalized before this fucking queue pops I swear

[2023-01-09 12:00:50] <+yaboiobz> @FLIPFLAP2222 yes,  a judge can give anybody money in a breakup.  for example if you were dating somebody for 15 years and had children together,  if you breakup and separate, the jusdge will view that as a marriage even if not legally married and make a monetary judgement
[2023-01-09 12:00:53] <+LaL1LuLeL0> Clueless
[2023-01-09 12:00:53] <%+boytonius> Yeah like, if you already think theyre gonna be in the marragie for your money, then you shouldnt be together.
[2023-01-09 12:01:05] <ppDown2Floor_> its important even for other reasons like major injury, medical issues, children, property etc.. lots of other stuff other than just to make sure they arent stealing half. my law professor was extremely adamant we all get one regardless

[2023-01-09 12:01:25] <%Waizer> It's insane to think that both you and your partner will be the same people in 10 years or even 5 years time. People change and sometimes what is perfect can change, no ones fault but it happens

[2023-01-09 12:01:37] <%hewliss> Prenup is an agreement entered into by a couple which sets out how assets will be divided if they divorce or the marriage is dissolved.
[2023-01-09 12:01:42] <Tsuniko> xqc is canadian tho so his situation is fucked, that coun try is going to absolute shit
[2023-01-09 12:01:43] <kid__gorgeous> what are the odds xqc keeps his money and adept doesnt get any of it? high or low?
[2023-01-09 12:01:51] <+tm_901> @FLIPFLAP2222 kinda unfair that you dont get the opportunity to prenup though

[2023-01-09 12:02:07] <+yaboiobz> A prenup sets the ground rules.  Would you play a sport if there were no specific written rules?  of course not.

[2023-01-09 12:03:32] <+yaboiobz> BY THE WAY CHAT, a prenup can have a "sunset date."  Which is basically an expiration date.  so after 30 years of marriage or something is expires.

[2023-01-09 12:07:07] <+yaboiobz> Im american, 29 years old with a heavy retirement already saved up.  im a serious relationship with an immigrant (non citizen).  We have spoke about a prenup and she is 100% willing to sign one if I ask her to
[2023-01-09 12:07:23] <RiftaHere> Its just easier. If you own a house together, you sell it and split the money. And then each of you will keep your own wealth. It was different in the old days when the man would work and women stay at home, in which case women wouldn't be able to accumulate wealth. But its not like that today (In Denmark at least)

[2023-01-09 13:11:43] <%sekcaJ> You have to balance around the top players by design
[2023-01-09 13:11:43] <Bobful> <3
[2023-01-09 13:11:47] <neefloW> @sekcaJ why would you need to exploit it if its not broken in the first place

[2023-01-09 13:12:14] <fearmasta> balancing for low ranks is like lowering the bastketball hoop because you can't jump
[2023-01-09 13:12:15] <bigbananamanana> PepePls
[2023-01-09 13:12:17] <+iiiRexOverwatchiii> 2 scenarios, balance for top500,,mercy,brig etc get a free ride to Plat...Balance around Plat, and there are 5 must picks in top500,,,the choice is easy
[2023-01-09 13:12:20] <%sekcaJ> @neefloW It's a competitive game, everyone will try to exploit the game to gain an advantage

[2023-01-09 13:12:34] <bryndi98> why not balance around top500? they’re the ones that are gonna stick around & keep playing, the casuals don’t care about balance lol

[2023-01-09 13:13:04] <ppDown2Floor_> i buy like 4 eat them all then go again
[2023-01-09 13:13:06] <J4A9> definitely rebuy when going low, just like toilet paper
[2023-01-09 13:13:07] <%Bythisgirl> it varies for me
[2023-01-09 13:13:11] <SyntxOW> run out and wait 2 months to buy one again
[2023-01-09 13:13:17] <Alfregno> i buy 5 boxes and when i have 1 i buy another 5 boxes
[2023-01-09 13:13:19] <+iiiRexOverwatchiii> you can always eat cookies and milk instead of cereal
[2023-01-09 13:13:20] <bigbananamanana> always gotta have 1 box spare

[2023-01-09 13:13:43] <Kasdwer> @iiiRexOverwatchiii heroes that dont take any skill was a mistake itself, its why the game failed as a competitive game in the first place, game needs the same base mechanic for all heroes like in csgo/moba or otherwise you gonna have mercy main at top500
[2023-01-09 13:13:45] <%sekcaJ> @neefloW nah, it applies just the same. GOATS was a thing because they exploited AOE heals stacking

[2023-01-09 13:14:17] <neefloW> @sekcaJ again, i feel like exploiting isnt the right word because it tells that its something inherently not intended

[2023-01-09 13:14:36] <neefloW> aoe heals stacking was a design decision/flaw, which people abused

[2023-01-09 13:14:42] <+RoelCrack> toilet paper is so annoying
[2023-01-09 13:14:48] <+iiiRexOverwatchiii> @Kasdwer hard disagree, imagine a hero that had one power, if the hero stays in spawn the entire match all other teammates get an extra 75HP,,, there is nothing "wrong" with this hero, it is balanced
[2023-01-09 13:14:48] <%xGenero> goats def wasnt inherently intended
[2023-01-09 13:14:51] <rabbitman29> u put the loose parts of the roll in front of at the back

[2023-01-09 13:15:23] <Murmillos> poop water?
[2023-01-09 13:15:25] <bigbananamanana> so u'd rather smear ur ass with toilet paper instead??
[2023-01-09 13:15:28] <+Deffect_ZA> better to live with a poopy butt hole?
[2023-01-09 13:15:29] <kleenklyine> you wash your ass then dry it with toilet paper
[2023-01-09 13:15:29] <wuinxow> but u shove ur finger up your ass with a bit of paper covering it ?
[2023-01-09 13:15:30] <neefloW> they meant to make the game be able to choose how many of each role you could play and they meant to stack aoe heals
[2023-01-09 13:15:30] <%Bythisgirl> poop water on you is always fun:)

[2023-01-09 13:15:51] <Mustastic> if you got shit on your hands would you only wipe it off with tissue or wash your hands? monkaHmm
[2023-01-09 13:15:56] <Kasdwer> @iiiRexOverwatchiii its not balanced because it fails the competitive system, as soon as you can go afk with 1 hero and reach 1 ranking, the entire ranking system will be a joke. mercy/brig and other easy heroes were a mistake and should have never been implemented into a competitive game

[2023-01-09 13:56:03] <+pauleCS> @krushrx you didnt play high ranked cs i guess
[2023-01-09 13:56:04] <Kliptec> a game with  respawn
[2023-01-09 13:56:07] <rejd_> quake is crazy tho
[2023-01-09 13:56:09] <Kliptec> vs a  game  with 1 life per round
[2023-01-09 13:56:10] <iiiliiilillliyirmiyahua> @neefloW csgo is easier to climb because it's easier to carry your team alone, that's true
[2023-01-09 13:56:16] <Kliptec> u  think the gamae with respawns takes more thinking
[2023-01-09 13:56:17] <+Tmanxp> @pauleCS tell that too all the dps players that need to shoot at flyers
[2023-01-09 13:56:17] <biodinosaur> @Kliptec ge lvl10 faceit bruh
[2023-01-09 13:56:17] <Kliptec> really..

[2023-01-09 13:56:23] <%sekcaJ> Have you seen what happened in Brazil Kragie ?
[2023-01-09 13:56:27] <tendiesPls> quake players are absolutely insane

[2023-01-09 13:56:43] <neefloW> @iiiliiilillliyirmiyahua its just learning predictable pathing mostly up to dmg and from there you actually need to comm a little bit
[2023-01-09 13:56:44] <KillaManDan> you clearly aren't thinking in OW mr plat
[2023-01-09 13:56:45] <0verzealou5> Cs kinda looked like old relic.
[2023-01-09 13:56:45] <Kliptec> i was supreme master first calss in  csgo
[2023-01-09 13:56:50] <+Tmanxp> any arena/hero shooter takes more skill then a stagnant aim based game like cs
[2023-01-09 13:56:50] <%+tm_901> holy shit guys its simple, different skillsets
[2023-01-09 13:56:53] <FreddyLA> don't come to brazil

[2023-01-09 13:57:45] <+Tmanxp> @pauleCS thats a skill issue if you cant aim when you already hold down an angle first
[2023-01-09 13:57:54] <MatchHistory> both games take a different type of skill

[2023-01-09 13:58:32] <+Tmanxp> @iiiliiilillliyirmiyahua thats all cs basically is

[2023-01-09 13:58:43] <Teccon> @kragiee Do you ever feel like sojurn messes up your aim? Like long term getting used to strafe shooting rather than like cassidy aiming for example?
[2023-01-09 13:58:44] <+shoutoutmentalillnes> The best part is Bolsonaro just peaced out to Florida while Brazil is in chaos over his election
[2023-01-09 13:58:49] <%xGenero> play both, theyre both free
[2023-01-09 13:58:53] <iiiliiilillliyirmiyahua> @Tmanxp all games have it, even OW lol
[2023-01-09 13:58:55] <+Tmanxp> theres no skill involved in playing the waiting game for angle holds or peeking
[2023-01-09 13:59:03] <+Tmanxp> ow has more

[2023-01-09 13:59:18] <+Tmanxp> lots of movement
[2023-01-09 13:59:19] <%Saber_Ramoth> That harambe really wants you
[2023-01-09 13:59:24] <theshaggydogpoo> @pauleCS its an online thing, the peeker has advantgage as the defender has to wait for latency before they see the peaker, who sees immediately
[2023-01-09 13:59:37] <krushrx> @Tmanxp true ow need more skills and need iq to play in team
[2023-01-09 13:59:47] <MatchHistory> i just noticed kragiee doesnt have the picture up anymore. is this different house? or time to retire old background
[2023-01-09 13:59:47] <+Tmanxp> then you have anticipation of hero abilities and ultimates
[2023-01-09 13:59:48] <%sekcaJ> The game truly boils down to control the Sojourn
[2023-01-09 13:59:49] <neefloW> which is why playing on high ping severely favors aggressive play in cs

[2023-01-09 14:19:16] <hinjahfue> the girl i want to marry, i will happily give her everything
[2023-01-09 14:19:18] <aryp> 💯
[2023-01-09 14:19:23] <%jovach23> my ex was rich should have stuck with her Kappa
[2023-01-09 14:19:26] <%ketaruz> taxes HmmBusiness
[2023-01-09 14:19:27] <+rolled90> absolutely disgusting that your partner can take away your hard earned money through divorce. If you have kids you should pay for that, but to have to pay for an adult that can earn their own money. no way
[2023-01-09 14:19:45] <ppDown2Floor_> if u want my opinion as a lawyer, she will probably get some of the assets as gifts instead of actual common marriage property and then it will get dropped. I don't see her getting any of the stream income unless there is big info we arent getting
[2023-01-09 14:19:46] <%+boytonius> @hinjahfue does she exist?
[2023-01-09 14:19:48] <%TheFitnessGamer> @xGenero its true yeah, Ashe and even soldider seem like better options it seems. Besides widow and sojourn too

[2023-01-09 14:31:41] <zelnyte_> why not play ashe
[2023-01-09 14:31:45] <Durpah> if anything streaming seems mentally draining since you're under the eye of so many people constantly
[2023-01-09 14:31:45] <Awesome356> Morning mr kragie
[2023-01-09 14:31:47] <!%Mikeverv> It must be hard if you cant let it go after you done streaming for the day
[2023-01-09 14:31:55] <%RossTheBoss__> when u play a character on stream ie asmongold it's mentally exhausting I bet

[2023-01-09 14:31:59] <hinjahfue> parents hell is real too
[2023-01-09 14:32:00] <%jovach23> thing about streaming is, that it doesn't really set you up for a career with transferable skills so when you're like 40 what will you do
[2023-01-09 14:32:00] <tendiesPls> VIBE
[2023-01-09 14:32:09] <%jovach23> most other careers when you're 40 you're senior level

[2023-01-09 14:33:29] <brianm1996> @kragiee i think the question your trying to ask is do u think its hard to stay relivent more than "streaming" bc anyone can stream but its hard to stay relivent and keep an audience
[2023-01-09 14:33:30] <%jovach23> yea
[2023-01-09 14:33:34] <ppDown2Floor_> hardest part of everything is starting I think

[2023-01-09 14:34:02] <%jovach23> you can be on 100k a year after 6 years of coding and you can learn it all online
[2023-01-09 14:34:03] <krushrx> streamer mus be stressed if viewers decline

[2023-01-09 15:36:26] <%sekcaJ> no
[2023-01-09 15:36:40] <ppDown2Floor_> it does win time/loss time
[2023-01-09 15:37:07] <+OldeScallywag> I guess for a win it adds the minutes of all heroes you played to your lifetime total and then updates winrate based on time spent in winning games/time total
