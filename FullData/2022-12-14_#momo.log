[2022-12-14 00:11:44] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @zodiacarcangel1 There's been a few theories. One is where he was slain in GOW 3 being a mural depicting a Phoenix. Another points to him absorbing the Soul of Hades, who is an avatar of Death. It could even be as basic as him fully awakening his Godly heritage, since he is a Demi-God.

[2022-12-14 00:47:03] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @Gamln to Krato's credit, Literacy wasn't part of a Spartan's education. That being said, he may not be able to read books, but he can read maps and he can count. In conclusion, he's likely illiterate, but not uneducated.

[2022-12-14 00:50:02] <%arreffem> uni420  As Philip II of Macedon was conquering Greek city-states left and right, Sparta was left alone. Philip had achieved a crushing victory, and Sparta was relatively weak and without walls. Philip sent a message to the Spartans saying “If I invade Lakonia you will be destroyed, never to rise again.” The Spartans replied with one word, “If.”

[2022-12-14 03:24:00] <%CouchBoundHero> Kratos certainly knows how to get... a head! AHA
[2022-12-14 03:24:00] <%zodiacarcangel1> My favorite line in the game IM going to cut of you head now fair enough
[2022-12-14 03:24:02] <+Xerenix> He keeps getting head in all the games NODDERS
[2022-12-14 03:24:02] <%cynicalCosmozoan> Fun fact, in the mythos of the Norse he's just a head anyway.
[2022-12-14 03:24:04] <%daverboy> and of course Kratos already knows how to properly secure a head to his belt for carry and use
[2022-12-14 03:24:07] <%Animewolf17> Conveniently cuts off a rope too haha
[2022-12-14 03:24:09] <%daverboy> since he's done it before

[2022-12-14 04:19:26] <danknugglit> Truu
[2022-12-14 04:19:44] <%+Chaddingway> It's almost as if the storm is responding to Kratos' emotions at this moment
[2022-12-14 04:19:50] <legendarybroly92> i always assumed the storm during this scene was cause Thor was in Midgard
[2022-12-14 04:19:52] <%+Chaddingway> Or is brought on because of it

[2022-12-14 04:20:51] <@%Strykur> it's responding to kratos' anger

[2022-12-14 04:20:53] <@%Strykur> not thor
[2022-12-14 04:20:54] <!%+Zzyzx_Prime> God this game was so FUN
[2022-12-14 04:20:55] <%+Chaddingway> @legendarybroly92 Cause Kratos is seeing red thinking about his past KEKW
[2022-12-14 04:21:02] <%IndecisiveJohn> The sky is turning read because it read the script and knows its cues
[2022-12-14 04:21:02] <BlackAlchemist> and this is probably way they never did the kill animations
[2022-12-14 04:21:13] <nameless_hack> The Past will have it's due
[2022-12-14 04:21:15] <%+Crona_Steingate> yeah you punch that tree
[2022-12-14 04:21:17] VIEWERS: 1 514
[2022-12-14 04:21:24] <%zodiacarcangel1> The storm is probably there because either Thor is enraged by the death of his son or because Kratos killed a god again since every time a god is slane some natural disaster happens.
[2022-12-14 04:21:26] <!%+Zzyzx_Prime> They should have a mod where you just chop trees down all day
[2022-12-14 04:21:35] <+apathybones> @twilight_gamer9206 I thought at this moment Thor found out about Magni's death from Modi
[2022-12-14 04:21:39] <GoatMutt> Fist them all
[2022-12-14 04:21:42] <dragonfriend7738> it's gotta be a jarring experience to have to change fighting style now that you can't call on Atreus for backup
[2022-12-14 04:21:50] <%wowow2264> Kratos going to get his weapons reminds of that scene of John Wick retrieving his weapons after those guys killed his dog.
[2022-12-14 04:21:54] <%xChemicalGhostx> Kinda wish they had more then one finishers.

[2022-12-14 04:28:52] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @Twilight_Gamer9206 Main theory is that after bringing about the Greek Apocalypse, Kratos retrieved them before leaving. The power those blades contain is too dangerous. Even Kratos can barely contain their power. Nevermind anyone else. Better to keep them, than to abandon them and cause untold havoc and destruction.

[2022-12-14 04:40:41] <Scoobky> @Momo  fun fact from this game (the GOW 2018 game) Christopher Judge (Kratos VA) said his performance as Kratos was a love letter to his kids showing his dedication to the character as it hit super personal for him (i think he even cried while doing the mocap of Kratos)

[2022-12-14 06:28:16] <Cantiel> @fgcphoenix out of curiosity, whats your opinion on AC valhalla's telling of the lore?

[2022-12-14 06:28:48] <fgcphoenix> @fgcphoenix Oh yeah, 100% but they always stick to the same story beats. Like when I started the game I knew instantly that the "Stranger" was Baldur, and that the mistletoe arrows were going to be the thing that leads to all this happening. I'm still on the fence about the depiction of the Gods in this. But I understand the tone they were going for.
[2022-12-14 06:28:58] <Mellentt> honestly poor freya, trying to stop the fight but unable to actually get involved due to her curse

[2022-12-14 06:30:07] <fgcphoenix> @Cantiel Uh to be honest I haven't finished AC Valhalla, but from what I've seen of the Asgard stuff so far it's fairly accurate, at least with the demeanor of the Gods, it's also fairly accurate with the culture of the people at the time
[2022-12-14 06:30:15] <@%Strykur> it's that she just isn't able to right now because of where they are

[2022-12-14 06:32:52] <fgcphoenix> @fgcphoenix Well it's more just that the game seems to solely focus on the negative aspects of some of the Gods, like Baldur for example is always talked about in the stories as being the brightest and most favorable of all the Gods, everyone accept Loki loves him, and everything in existence promises not to hurt him, except mistletoe because  Frigg didn't think to ask it, because who would expect it to do anything. But again I understand the theme and story they are trying to tell. It's a inter
[2022-12-14 06:32:57] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @AidedPlacebo That's about as likely as Aphrodite re-virginizing herself.

[2022-12-14 06:35:18] <%+commanderpoes> That's one thing that I feel like this boss fight did well, it makes you feel like it was entirely unnecessary and could've been avoided so it gives that level of discomfort that you're needlessly beating the shit out of someone's child right in front of them as she begs for you both to stop fighting. But you know that if you stop, Baldur will kill Freya. It's that kind of fight that you know shouldn't happen and should be avoidable, yet here you are.

[2022-12-14 06:45:08] <+Madd_Magikarp> @Salimufari In the myth, Baldur came back on his own, and during Ragnarok

[2022-12-14 06:45:11] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @fgcphoenix In some interpretations of Norse Myth, isn't Freya considered to be the mother of the Valkyries?
[2022-12-14 06:45:11] <lycan_silas> It doesn’t matter, Baldur has fallen…next comes Fimbulwinter…the start of the end always begins with him

[2022-12-14 06:45:38] <%+Salimufari> maybe. I hope so.

[2022-12-14 06:45:48] <+Madd_Magikarp> @Momo , Freya would not want that for her son
[2022-12-14 06:45:48] <Mellentt> mimir is psuedo undead
[2022-12-14 06:45:52] <Enatai> Mimir is not alive, He is just a talking head
[2022-12-14 06:45:54] <JESover> its a bit different i guess
[2022-12-14 06:45:55] <%lildigle> I don't think she can bring him back, it would probably take to long to get back to her place and revive him in time
[2022-12-14 06:45:59] <WhispersAlone> Baldur was broken for many centuries. Broken glass in an immortal body.
[2022-12-14 06:46:03] <$Strode_exe> Gods don't have an afterlife to come back from
[2022-12-14 06:46:05] <%+AngelOfChaox> Mimir was an outsider, vs Baldur who was an Aesir. That death isn't something that can be fixed
[2022-12-14 06:46:09] <%shadoukira92> which god of war is this
[2022-12-14 06:46:15] <@%Strykur> 2018
[2022-12-14 06:46:15] <darkhorizons45> Baldur would not stop. As an act of mercy, Kratos stopped him from going down the same path.
[2022-12-14 06:46:17] <@%Grothmar9> @shadoukira92 4
[2022-12-14 06:46:18] <lycan_silas> What happens to Baldur is a fixed point. His death is something that can never be prevented
[2022-12-14 06:46:19] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> @Strode_exe Tell that to Athena
[2022-12-14 06:46:20] <fgcphoenix> @fgcphoenix That's an interpretation I've heard, but we don't have any primary sources to confirm that, in the sagas she IS confirmed to command them, hence her being called their Queen
[2022-12-14 06:46:22] <%$TrophyThomas> pretty sure when he broke his neck is damged his brain so she cant bring him back
[2022-12-14 06:46:30] <Nekosuki72> geegaNODDERS
[2022-12-14 06:46:33] <%+AntojoP> Mimir head was reanimated
[2022-12-14 06:46:33] <%+ArcticWaste> Freya big mad
[2022-12-14 06:46:35] <+Flipipin> Mimir isn’t truely alive it would do numbers on Freyas psyche if she did the same thing on Baldur
[2022-12-14 06:46:40] <%BLAZERTHIEF> baldur was gonna do a loki route if this didnt happen
[2022-12-14 06:46:44] <abaranger16> she cant bring him back cause she cant leave i thought
[2022-12-14 06:46:53] <cyborg2414> It’s funny because in Norse lore baldur does die from a middle toe arrow
[2022-12-14 06:46:59] <$Strode_exe> @Strode_exe She "ascended" so meh
[2022-12-14 06:47:08] <%Archangel_2> What did he find I wonder?
[2022-12-14 06:47:08] <+AidedPlacebo> i just googled Baldur, thes god of light and peace?????
[2022-12-14 06:47:11] <+Madd_Magikarp> @lycan_silas Yeah, especially cuz in the myth, Odin bloody tried and failed
[2022-12-14 06:47:11] <fgcphoenix> @Salimufari iirc he only comes back AFTER
[2022-12-14 06:47:14] <dragonfriend7738> Baldur could have been brought back if every creature living shed a tear for him, but Loki refused to cry for the dead god, and prevented him from being resurrected (in the original myth)
[2022-12-14 06:47:22] <darkhorizons45> If Freya brought him back after what she already put him through, she’d be torturing him
[2022-12-14 06:47:32] <+Madd_Magikarp> @dragonfriend7738 exactly
[2022-12-14 06:47:32] <%$biggerb0at> I just googled baldur apperently theres a gate

[2022-12-14 07:01:56] <glowhusky> game of the year
[2022-12-14 07:01:57] <%daverboy> Loki, Faye's son
[2022-12-14 07:01:58] <%+AngelOfChaox> I love the moments I realized that some of the biggest differences in the lore of this game vs the Edas is that there was a lack of Loki.
[2022-12-14 07:02:03] <fgcphoenix> I mean, his stories were more lessons for his son than actual stories, especially the one about the Horse, Hunter and Stag
[2022-12-14 07:02:04] <JornNightmane> Oi, no spoilers on the next chapter mrbrunAngry

[2022-12-14 07:26:53] <Ronin_Remix> Not Marvel Thor
[2022-12-14 07:26:57] <atreus53211> Ron pearman as thor is more funny than anything one else

[2022-12-14 07:27:18] <%+Salimufari> also MCU Thor & comic Thor are very different too.

[2022-12-14 07:28:47] <+engezerstorung> the discussion is calling for spoilers, the only way is just to play at this point XD
[2022-12-14 07:28:49] <Ronin_Remix> you have to play, and feel it
[2022-12-14 07:28:54] <+Ender1321> So when is she playing ragnarok?
[2022-12-14 07:28:55] <SCBarnabas> l

[2022-12-14 07:30:04] <fgcphoenix> @Aro_GER While it's frustrating, Marvel is a primary way that people get introduced to the faith, and if it encourages people to pursue the call that they feel...I'll take that frustration

[2022-12-14 07:30:12] <+engezerstorung> well, for my standarts, its kind of spoilery but as you see it fit...
[2022-12-14 07:30:30] <%+Entissus> even just talking about the voice is.. it is too much for "who" the character is
[2022-12-14 07:30:32] <%+Entissus> imo
[2022-12-14 07:30:44] <prometheusprotocol> The guy that voices Thor does such a good job too
[2022-12-14 07:30:45] <brownieragna> every character in Ragnarok is so beautifully written, it's amazing, every character shines
[2022-12-14 07:30:47] <vulcanhroth1> every characters va in ragnarok is very good
[2022-12-14 07:30:49] <JESover> they did amazing job yes

[2022-12-14 07:31:18] <+Ender1321> Well not every character is good in ragnarok but most are
[2022-12-14 07:31:22] <CreaturePeepers> Ron Perlman was also cast for his face shape and how it looked in makeup
[2022-12-14 07:31:24] <%+dropthebeets> pacha meme for sure
[2022-12-14 07:31:24] <+engezerstorung> @vulcanhroth1 yeah and their psychology work so well, and without the need of a lot of written exposure, i loved it
