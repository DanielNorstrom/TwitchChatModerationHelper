[2022-12-08 16:45:12] <Aavvrriizz> I have a theory gold and silver are going to outperform the market next year. Besides the fact that they outperformed during the tech bubble there is a perfect storm brewing for gold and silver. There is a bear and bull case next year. The bear case is earnings will slow, the bull case is inflation will also slow and the Fed can be less aggressive. But gold and silver dont have slowing earnings and they will benefit from inflation slowing. The cherry on the cake is BTC is no longer gold
