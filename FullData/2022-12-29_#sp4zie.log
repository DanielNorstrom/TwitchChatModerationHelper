[2022-12-29 16:22:05] <+diogenes___> @Tjabo_0 No it's what it makes them unique. Also Riot balanced those champions individually. But when it's on items you have to consider 150 champions

[2022-12-29 16:27:26] <%itsaMochi> My ears have never been able to tolerate the sound of fireworks. It makes my ears ring and hurt if I am outside. I have always spent New years eve indoors whilst my family meets up outside

[2022-12-29 16:27:55] <%itsaMochi> Tried headsets etc before but doesnt work, its mostly the very loud ones though
[2022-12-29 16:28:16] <luchashh> alcohol and fireworks are not a good idea but it is a fun idea
[2022-12-29 16:28:24] <leipesalty> If something is AWEFULL in the NL is that people can use their own fireworks
[2022-12-29 16:28:29] <illyKadrian> anything that requires a degree of coordination and alcohol doesn't mix well :D
[2022-12-29 16:28:29] <%itsaMochi> Norway has basically banned most fireworks by now so youre only allowed a specific kind.
[2022-12-29 16:28:40] <legoatoom> @luchashh What about alcohol based fireworks?
[2022-12-29 16:29:08] <mnjmaverick> I recommend a game called "Fun facts" for a new years party
