[2022-12-21 16:54:15] <%+Deadlyshot16> now we have 15+ cops ready to shoot from any angle in a kill zone.
[2022-12-21 16:54:17] <%+crazyeyed_killa> That is correct

[2022-12-21 16:54:26] <FoomDog> If kill zones tap other. It should allow crims to go 6+
[2022-12-21 16:54:30] <BFGHouse> that's the crims only advantage

[2022-12-21 17:01:46] <@%RcAdam> as someone who looked up to this server from 2.0 and thought very highly of this server it breaks my heart to see it in this state

[2022-12-21 17:01:55] <%SparkPJ> Morning Hutch, how you feeling?
[2022-12-21 17:01:56] <FoomDog> I remember when they tried to enforce following speed limit/red lights, or it was "against rp" earlier in the year

[2022-12-21 17:02:08] <%tdodrago> @rcadam Agreed
[2022-12-21 17:02:12] <+kevn_724> koil banned someone for beeping his horn too much @HutchMF
[2022-12-21 17:02:15] <%defiantal> If it's unwritten then that is a unlawful ban.
[2022-12-21 17:02:20] <@%AyeGavMF> THE HORN LMAO
[2022-12-21 17:02:27] <rameesspit> Yeah it’s all testing for the hardcore server lol
[2022-12-21 17:02:30] <ZulrahGaming> that made sense for the Old courthouse because it was a teleport right?
[2022-12-21 17:02:34] <%Emywox> its really sad but nothing will change
[2022-12-21 17:02:34] <%+HeSoGrizzly> nothing will change
[2022-12-21 17:02:37] <+marjoe32> THIS
[2022-12-21 17:02:39] <%shady_hero> I just hope Kebun's point of "koil is gonna weed out the WL of cops that abuse this new stuff"
[2022-12-21 17:02:42] <@%AyeGavMF> i forgot about the horn haha
[2022-12-21 17:02:43] <%+HeSoGrizzly> exactly
[2022-12-21 17:02:44] <%tdodrago> Remember the flute that ramee had
[2022-12-21 17:02:47] <+gabrielg1010> you need to swap the people not just the mechanics
[2022-12-21 17:02:54] <Yungbeck> Over usage of car horn is also unwritten rule IRL so
[2022-12-21 17:02:55] <%+seesee03> the problem doesnt change when the same people are still around.
[2022-12-21 17:02:57] <+DieselSJ> Hardcore... like one life?
[2022-12-21 17:02:58] <%Emywox> the server isnt a etch a sketch
[2022-12-21 17:03:03] <+kevn_724> @AyeGavMF LUL classsic
[2022-12-21 17:03:04] <B3KA> lol that accent
[2022-12-21 17:03:07] <SlayerSlapsHD> Do you think Davenport will be a cop in 4.0? He has little to no RP
[2022-12-21 17:03:14] <%+lesliem96> nah I give it two weeks max
[2022-12-21 17:03:16] <+xilostx> Scottish koil
[2022-12-21 17:03:18] <%defiantal> A month? Ha, how optimistic.
[2022-12-21 17:03:20] <mossphloxx> all crims should just not interact with them imo
[2022-12-21 17:03:21] <+woodcassette> No crim will want to play HC server
[2022-12-21 17:03:25] <Leijm> the theory is that Koil implemented all this to see who exploits to see who he is gonna kick from the force
[2022-12-21 17:03:28] <%+03Turbo03> what is he suppose to do
[2022-12-21 17:03:32] <%+kedmeister1> early 3.0 if car chase went on to long cops would shoot driver lol
[2022-12-21 17:03:33] <@%RcAdam> it just needs to wipe at this point
[2022-12-21 17:03:36] <%triggeredviewer> @slayerslapshd that’s most cops
[2022-12-21 17:03:36] <+AP2453> Yeah hardcore won’t last long ppl don’t want consequences the just bitch about others rp
[2022-12-21 17:03:39] <+YumboYak25> Doesn’t change bc it’s seeped into High Command who act like this
[2022-12-21 17:03:42] <+ClickinSkulls> is hutch dying?
[2022-12-21 17:03:42] <goat_remote> 2.0 was the most balanced
[2022-12-21 17:03:43] <+trinimini10> @SlayerSlapsHD thats crazy to say
[2022-12-21 17:03:45] <+keldoran1> Damn that koil impersonation is spot on!
[2022-12-21 17:03:52] <sylentfox> I don’t think any of the cg boys will stick to the hardcore longer than a week or two

[2022-12-21 17:04:25] <+absolutelydogwater> @hutchmf I think there are people who abuse mechanics which is not rp.
[2022-12-21 17:04:26] <+kevn_724> cuz they were people who rped as cops, not whatevr it is these days
[2022-12-21 17:04:29] <+itschampa> compounds are overdone now most gangs just sit inside there comfort zone all day
[2022-12-21 17:04:33] <@%AyeGavMF> theres a major difference with it now to then tho no one was making a million a year money ruined the game but its a neccessary evil
[2022-12-21 17:04:38] <+absolutelydogwater> The whole closing the gate on Curtis and Bobby yesterday was stupid.
[2022-12-21 17:04:38] <BFGHouse> RP was much better then, like I said the more serious ruleset is what brought out the great RP the SBS shit lately is hard to watch
[2022-12-21 17:04:39] <WatermelonZest> @SlayerSlapsHD his character is like captain holt from b99 he is one of the better cops there is who understands both sides
[2022-12-21 17:04:43] <%+walkybalbowa> Fun RP is super difficult to find now, someone is always upset that they lost
[2022-12-21 17:05:13] <BFGHouse> that was actually so bad
[2022-12-21 17:05:13] <+WarNerve66> randy

[2022-12-21 17:06:01] <poncandom> what is that aim ??
[2022-12-21 17:06:04] <mdushan> @HutchMF did u see the removal of crosshair dot on the bike?

[2022-12-21 17:06:19] <@%RcAdam> cg was saying anywhere in there spray territory was a "kill zone" and shot cops
[2022-12-21 17:06:21] <+strikeoutzero> was the aim
[2022-12-21 17:06:23] <%+walkybalbowa> The body armor got buffed, no?
[2022-12-21 17:06:24] <%+zodoxttv> just spray and pray

[2022-12-21 17:10:25] <%Emywox> the fact they rolled on randy with double the crim unit limit is WILD and there was like 25 more on duty waiting
[2022-12-21 17:10:25] <SirSmokin> so... what about drama and bans?
[2022-12-21 17:10:26] <goat_remote> there pistole shoots twice faster and no recoil and they are 4x numbers KEKW

[2022-12-21 17:11:28] <%+Opeyevil> I think that's what trav is doing
[2022-12-21 17:11:28] <+SlightlyEvilToaster> So, it feels like the issue is that the Cops and Crims have opposite goals so 'winning' is zero sum.  Need to find a reward system that allows both to advance/win in a situation.
[2022-12-21 17:11:30] <%Emywox> just start pulling barriers down in a crim scene
[2022-12-21 17:11:31] <@%AyeGavMF> it aint worth the headache

[2022-12-21 17:24:28] <%TSHARRS6> @Padge_ 3/4 cops probably do
[2022-12-21 17:24:29] <+Xairuz> I thought the mask only gives cops PC if they are in an area where the incident happens.
[2022-12-21 17:24:34] <%tdodrago> Chat cops can’t 2v1 crims so they need that one more get that edge
[2022-12-21 17:24:36] <%mckinz_> another issue is this snow, crims aren't doing as much because they can barely drive so cops run 40-50 deep against a squad of 6

[2022-12-21 17:34:01] <+RealKingLear> Since we're in the process of adding ridiculous amounts of advantage on the PD side I think that they should give PD Tow an armored tow truck because reasons.

[2022-12-21 17:34:25] <loverboy101010> should use barriers against street races if they drive past it shoot them

[2022-12-21 17:34:41] <jaykay9906> I meannnnn... Techinally if you stick 1 barrier down then the whole city is crossing it so you can shoot everyone
[2022-12-21 17:34:46] <%+nick_dr1ft> @devilishpuppy isnt that the same as no limit tho?
[2022-12-21 17:34:49] <+devilishpuppy> just have to reset another if it despawns
[2022-12-21 17:34:51] <%$b4none> @realkinglear yeah and make it drive like a S class

[2022-12-21 17:34:59] <ohhgawdno> @CDT_tv seems legit. haha

[2022-12-21 18:42:35] <+QQMOAAR> @QQMOAAR ah aite cool thanks!
[2022-12-21 18:42:37] <%+midori96> its a doggy dog world out there, have u seen a lion or some animal like that, chase the baddest motherf*cker, no they go for the easy one
[2022-12-21 18:42:41] <%+Opeyevil> yeah that's what he was referring too. you can't run into a group of 5 people, as a solo cop. That was a specific situation not generally chasing a smoking racecar
[2022-12-21 18:42:56] <aces2107> yupp
[2022-12-21 18:42:57] <Ladykissykins> hes not saying nvl for chasing a smoking car. hes saying the cop has NVL for his own life thinking he can walk up to 5 crims and be untouched.

[2022-12-21 18:44:46] <ErebusBC> These recent updates aren't it imo, they have good intentions with the barriers/mask/strikes but the legislation wasn't good at all.  If cops are abusing it, they should get fired/suspended
[2022-12-21 18:45:17] <racknar419> @ladykissykins everyone is ignorant
[2022-12-21 18:45:21] <%+Opeyevil> cops will never get punished for abusing SOPs

[2022-12-21 18:45:34] <daddy_dago730> They're having a mind blowing revelation right now realizing they misunderstood dog eat dog and reevaluating their life lol
[2022-12-21 18:45:36] <jskinn3> @ErebusBC  any situation where there is a zone that is basically a free kill zone is a terrible idea.

[2022-12-21 18:54:54] <AstroN74> The issue I see with these barriers, is basically that it gives the cops the ability to choose when they “close a scene” and create a killzone wherever they want. I maybe wrong idk

[2022-12-21 19:33:36] <+lenon_csgo> is there something like north, east, west and south police departments when there's a ton of police on? Where they respond to their areas mainly unless they are requested. @HutchMF

[2022-12-21 20:30:02] <DeadeyeJF> @phillfirth IRL you wouldnt have a cop with just one other cop go into a gang area to voice cops plans to enforce rules on gangs and crims.  Yes i understand itll turn to shouting but from all i see and hear the last week is the decline of NP because of these rules to enforce pretty much content and character backstory
[2022-12-21 20:30:08] <yfour20> that made me laugh mineo is a joker
[2022-12-21 20:30:08] <+RBSR5> should be illegal to have PD and common sense in the same sentence

[2022-12-21 20:38:13] <Vezarix> they dont wanna RP as cops, they wanna rp as gangsters with badges so they have zero consequence

[2022-12-21 20:44:02] <+aussie_herobrine> @nunezphoto when he was talking about lower slots I thought that was dumb but honestly I think if it was smaller slots the rp would actually happen cos people just log on nopixel to hang with there friends most of the time these days
[2022-12-21 20:44:02] <nazbo95> none of this PD cares about peoples lives, then complain about rp
[2022-12-21 20:44:02] <yaboi_merdah> The common sense would be the barrier MUST be a small space and out of the way... then this is hardly an issue.... not locking down massive areas. They are OUT OF THE WAY.
[2022-12-21 20:44:06] <%+Botsumi> What happens to people walking out of their houses into a barrier?
[2022-12-21 20:44:08] <ErebusBC> True gav

[2022-12-21 20:49:40] <HeckinReaper> the bigger pitcher YEP
[2022-12-21 20:49:42] <%xRethe> Honestly, I agree with the barrier as long as it is used correctly. but some of these cops are  PepegaAim and want to shoot just as badly as criminals and do dumb shit
[2022-12-21 20:49:42] <%+FromThenToThen> @ayegavmf LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-21 20:49:46] <+Jarred56> Here i got a good fucking idea. Since the cops no longer want to actually rp and just want death matches, crims should band together one time and get like 20+ mfs to shit all over the pd KEKW
[2022-12-21 20:49:46] <AintNoNo> nobody said to let civilians in, just no shoot them NotLikeThis
[2022-12-21 20:49:46] <%0x0Byte> this whole discussion is malicious compliance vs common sense
[2022-12-21 20:49:52] <+kronostw> A triage point shouldnt be by an active shootout. lmao it should be away from it to give cops/crim medical attention
[2022-12-21 20:49:53] <+LoudPackNoReefa> It’s just so meta, no way to argue in rp
[2022-12-21 20:49:55] <ImZrex> cops are never punished for the dumb shit they do
[2022-12-21 20:49:56] <thereignmaker> it says what you CAN do, not necessarily what you HAVE to do
[2022-12-21 20:49:56] <Dyess> They all seem to be under the impression that crims are not gonna just park up right outside of the barricades and get the first shot off regardless
[2022-12-21 20:49:57] <+Dekanoss> the barriers are used to stop RP and just create a cod TDM map

[2022-12-21 20:50:24] <+reaperrose98> @AyeGavMF Yeah it honestly makes no sense like why do they want less rp in a rp server confused
[2022-12-21 20:50:27] <ErebusBC> but the mask mandate isn't baiting crims ?
[2022-12-21 20:50:33] <Therealpearce> magdump season ain't even possible now

[2022-12-21 20:56:50] <%0x0Byte> there is no RP without communication that simple
[2022-12-21 20:56:51] <+MountainMAN1990> It should say UP TO lethal
[2022-12-21 20:56:51] <%+iGreffer> that meant, you can asses to use lethal force
[2022-12-21 20:56:53] <+k4ncha> This is why shift 1 is RP and shift 2 is lets play COD
[2022-12-21 20:56:57] <ErebusBC> but there's NON-LETHAL force...

[2022-12-21 20:59:11] <%ShrimpOnTheBarbii> @fah__king I said it earlier it's a 500iq play by koil to see who abuses it
[2022-12-21 20:59:16] <+BriggzIsBiz> KEKW ?????? pred????
[2022-12-21 20:59:17] <%+FromThenToThen> kinds are
[2022-12-21 20:59:17] <+Steelen> @fah__king I am sensing that same concept. Trying to see who has the brains to develop an RP-appropriate approach. Instead of blasting, tasers on unarmed etc.
[2022-12-21 20:59:26] <ohhgawdno> each officer should have to sign off that they understand. it should be like a cert... that way you can hold them accountable
[2022-12-21 20:59:28] <phillfirth> so you have to wipe pd to uncuff somone
[2022-12-21 20:59:29] <+Jarred56> @fah__king Bro i'm actually praying koil is up to something like that KEKW
[2022-12-21 20:59:29] <+combattingjosh> @lilcb513 Mean, you can pull anything these days KEKW
[2022-12-21 20:59:35] <FoomDog> That's because of the +1500 strength on the bullet proof vest

[2022-12-21 20:59:44] <ImZrex> Make it take 5min to place a barrier

[2022-12-21 21:00:14] <+killogic916> it should take like 30 sec to put a barrier down, so they cant put them down mid gunfight

[2022-12-21 21:00:28] <+dasvaughan> @HutchMF so i love that your point was proven after they actually read the legislation lol read "up to and including deadly force" as "shoot immediately"  and now they are SILENT

[2022-12-21 21:06:33] <m_1ne> Blocking a full road will start shootouts with multiple people like imagine racers driving through that’ll trigger 20 more racers

[2022-12-21 21:06:44] <+stoneagekiller> it is easier to control a small area rather then a square mile

[2022-12-21 21:07:51] <1tickrs> unironically this might literally be how real police offers speak lmao
[2022-12-21 21:07:52] <+dasvaughan> Hutch you are extremely patient with them
[2022-12-21 21:07:53] <FoomDog> That's why boundaries always get out of hand with PD. Basically "Just roll witht he punches".
[2022-12-21 21:08:03] <+Smokebender> 6 hours in pd abused it "just give it time surely it will be fine"

[2022-12-21 21:08:41] <+BriggzIsBiz> @dasvaughan because its like talking to brick fuckin walls. you have to be patient or just give yourself a headache trying
[2022-12-21 21:08:42] <aces2107> @FromThenToThen i feel that lol

[2022-12-21 21:09:21] <%Emywox> poor desh even got shot at yesterday when you locked down the cg block
[2022-12-21 21:09:28] <iyiusashi> there was some decent points made...but the rule ended up being "shoot anyone on site crossing the bariers" which is kinda wrong
[2022-12-21 21:09:29] <phillfirth> @swizzynick good one 👍     so why ask if he's a cop when wearing cops uniform in a police station?  but dumb
[2022-12-21 21:09:31] <swizzynick> like are “kill zones” really needed let’s be honest
[2022-12-21 21:09:33] <%+phantomslain> u feeling better Hutch?

[2022-12-21 21:10:15] <%arma_bugs> kill zones and RP do not belong in the same sentence imo
[2022-12-21 21:10:18] <vicvega00> i don't think jared did anything that would get him trouble no?
[2022-12-21 21:10:28] <sherminator011> set up a barrier and shoot them legally

[2022-12-21 21:15:56] <iyiusashi> @HutchMF you should tell the southside gangs to put a gang color car at the entrance of their turf and then tell the cops after they enter the territory thats that their barrier.
