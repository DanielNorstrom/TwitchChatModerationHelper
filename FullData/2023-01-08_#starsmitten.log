[2023-01-08 03:19:15] <IKeroI> the problem with hero augment at 2-1 is that everyone plays rerroll

[2023-01-08 07:54:41] <+Curtit> the larger one is better bc the mobs respawn as you make it back to the other side
[2023-01-08 07:54:43] <nujjoon> Spawn rate seems better in C2

[2023-01-08 07:57:28] <%ManiaFreak> @silverminnow at 100 she can do zakum as a change of pace but it's the same thing after that
[2023-01-08 07:57:37] <shwumph> @badbihSHAY It's the +2 levels one. I don't remember what type of burning that is
[2023-01-08 07:57:47] <%silverminnow> It's more mushrooms and outside at the start @Uhblivean24
[2023-01-08 07:57:53] <+Curtit> burning means +2 levels per level
