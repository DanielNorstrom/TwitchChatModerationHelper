[2022-12-23 15:04:12] <cactusvic> The only reason why I play this game is because it just started playing it in July
[2022-12-23 15:04:12] <%+mishterwheatley> the map is too segregated

[2022-12-23 15:04:38] <+MistaJeffRee> As a casual, this is my favorite map, not even close. I seem to be in the minority though lol

[2022-12-23 15:04:54] <+Antman92> if you play a br chances are you aren't casually gaming when you get on
[2022-12-23 15:04:55] <+brickhearted> Team8 just left lol like ok
[2022-12-23 15:04:57] <easymoneyswipes> no fun for casuals playing broken moon.. you finally get a fight in the top 5 and everybody comes to third
[2022-12-23 15:04:58] <%BadChickenTaco> broken moon is equally broken. so it's actually balanced.
[2022-12-23 15:05:00] <%blaz3dnconfuz3d> It’s too easy sit on a roof with charge rifles
[2022-12-23 15:05:02] <Jacuzzi> @MistaJeffRee very much the same here

[2022-12-23 15:06:51] <@%BESTGlRL> @tvtu_tay people that are significantly better at the game than you think the map is bad
[2022-12-23 15:06:51] <%+ShiffTM> its not fair to force people into multiple team situations in a game where recovery is so important, add on top of that the fact you can hear in a 6 mile radius its like wyd

[2022-12-23 17:47:23] <%xxsteelpandaxx> It isn't going to be a writer off because you are giving to individuals not a charity
[2022-12-23 17:47:24] <+hurricanefrog> Write offs do not have to be bulk
[2022-12-23 17:47:26] <briisaann> Yeah I’m sure

[2022-12-23 17:47:26] <%GoldenArmGamer> @HisWattson charitable donations count as long as it's non profit org.  they're too expensive to be business write offs.
[2022-12-23 17:47:27] <%kirkochills> yes write off the total expense
[2022-12-23 17:47:28] <jcm369> Twitch chat ain’t him. Like we really not that guy bro

[2022-12-23 17:50:31] <xAnxietx> You realize with the size of his chat there is professionals in here correct? not everyone replying is speaking out their butts. Watson should have an LLC, just for liability reasons alone.
[2022-12-23 17:50:31] <%$theemonalisa> @turtletiff you’re the best osu gamer
[2022-12-23 17:50:31] <%BadChickenTaco> just noticed that poi has same color schemes as Crypto heirloom
[2022-12-23 17:50:31] <+BisforBuild> i’ve owned a business for many years and the best advice is stop asking twitch chat for advice, you can start a relationship with any large or small tax company for help and call them when you have  questions. Like your local H&R block to any accountant
[2022-12-23 17:50:32] <icon3d> @hiswattson you want to be an S corp and, every person saying llc is wrong.. but advertising is 100% write off. I wrote of 70,000 last year.

[2022-12-23 18:27:12] <nightshade82_> he sounds like a news caster
[2022-12-23 18:27:13] <jeauxlol> honestly, nobody puts in as much work as TSM, they train for hours, and Hal’s even working on controller so he can be even better at this game. Verhulst is literally beaming kids with his eyes closed with how much time he’s put in on apex. The addition of Reps and Raven to their team just proves that they have a winning mindset and are focused on the grind. With all of this hard work and effort, they can easily secure a top 15 spot in the next ALGS, #TSMWIN
[2022-12-23 18:27:13] <pelletreau> I like tsm but holy hell lol

[2022-12-23 19:38:52] <%ThisPrincess_> Why not just do no fill?
[2022-12-23 19:38:52] <@%Nephthys_52> isn't that boosting

[2022-12-23 19:38:53] <+BdwinE> would be hard, plus you'd need willing parc who would be cool losing rp

[2022-12-23 19:38:56] <+FakeKass> From Bronze to Master but alone, your team commits suicide by leaving the map and you play totally alone.
[2022-12-23 19:38:56] <+xkohei> youd need some good friends willing to just sit there for 8 hours doing that
[2022-12-23 19:38:57] <!%nihimm> that would require two people for every stream and at least 4 accounts (2 low level and 2 high level)
[2022-12-23 19:38:58] <%+ea_sports_nogame> your only comms can be "gigachad gaming"

[2022-12-23 19:40:21] <%spinch_13> Challenge is you have to wear a belt around your neck that gets progressively tighter the longer the game goes on. Getting a win causes you to pass out
[2022-12-23 19:40:29] <sarmad_fraz_ahmad> pistols only is bad, because you'll abuse Wingman the whole games....
[2022-12-23 19:40:29] <hasadhdjd> like they dont get to shoot but you have to protect them

[2022-12-23 20:43:06] <ItsVyse_> @HisWattson do you think this leak about clasees being special now that some legends see more play?
[2022-12-23 20:43:08] <%WarmSmiles> i'm da biggest bird i'm da biggest bird
[2022-12-23 20:43:10] <zekekemboi> Made it Diamond 3 solo q but not without contemplating uninstalling
[2022-12-23 20:43:12] <%+SYRPTOH> All I want for Christmas is a solo q ltm
[2022-12-23 20:43:16] <Pr2Hack> solo queuing in diamond not fun :(
[2022-12-23 20:43:16] <kucingkomplek> since when hiswattson no rank 1 anymore?
[2022-12-23 20:43:18] <+slurrii> pubs for 3 stacks
[2022-12-23 20:43:20] <+HeyokaFPS> Apex needs a rework
[2022-12-23 20:43:21] <DroskiezZ> I’m silver 2 and feel like I’m back in Diamond
[2022-12-23 20:43:22] <lvl4weedle> So much rng in BRs takes away from your true skill level
[2022-12-23 20:43:24] <Blokane> @ikhajiitmypants i just want a solo mode
[2022-12-23 20:43:26] <JayFearless7> I died to a pro and his 2 pred teammates when i was solo q in diamond last weeklol
[2022-12-23 20:43:27] <Blokane> then itd be fun imp
[2022-12-23 20:43:29] <Mewtyu> I’m Plat and 50% of the time I’m getting killed by Masters and Preds it feels like
[2022-12-23 20:43:34] <Blokane> imo*
[2022-12-23 20:43:34] <!%friedchickentenders> high rank is a kill race
[2022-12-23 20:43:34] <%WarmSmiles> @Pr2Hack yup. horrible. No one communicates
[2022-12-23 20:43:35] <%alexthe_gr8_> i dont have fun in pubs or ranked or in 3 stacks or solos
[2022-12-23 20:43:35] <DimmsdaleGimmeDome> @hiswattson when i was in play i got a gold and bronze teammates
[2022-12-23 20:43:36] <Medjay_Mart> And pubs is ranked with rp because of sbmm
[2022-12-23 20:43:36] <errachi> it was so much more fun to watch the stormpoint split too
[2022-12-23 20:43:38] <+zebmmm> they need placements to give more rp tbh
[2022-12-23 20:43:43] <hugemale69only> pubs are not fun for me because they are more sweaty than ranked
[2022-12-23 20:43:45] <mulaowwoww> This what ya wanted
[2022-12-23 20:43:47] <%ikhajiitmypants> it really is
[2022-12-23 20:43:47] <+HeyokaFPS> Playing edge is better Timmyz was the first to say it
[2022-12-23 20:43:48] <TheAttackDonkey> how would you fix it?

[2022-12-23 20:43:52] <@%^Nightbot> No one important.
[2022-12-23 20:43:52] <%+TruthisM> only way to fix it honestly is more HAL ENERGY
[2022-12-23 20:43:53] <CalamitousVX> So fucking true, had 15 kills top 8 and got +8 like wtf.
[2022-12-23 20:43:54] <@%SN0RLAXES> pros mad when they cant scan beacon and camp to win ranked OMEGALUL
[2022-12-23 20:43:55] <+ruin505> Sounds logical and seem valid when get to D teammates always say “down to rat”
[2022-12-23 20:43:57] <%puccomon> What should they do to fix it?
[2022-12-23 20:43:59] <%ikhajiitmypants> @mulaowwoww you talkin to the wrong person
[2022-12-23 20:44:02] <LV_LOCAL> @Mewtyu fully agree with this, i have never been close to a 20 kill badge or masters - yet everyone who kills me has both these
[2022-12-23 20:44:02] <leootaco7> so whats the best ranked system?
[2022-12-23 20:44:02] <mulaowwoww> Pro players was complaining and they made it like this not u but Hal

[2022-12-23 20:44:06] <CalamitousVX> There's no fix, go back to S13 split 1.
[2022-12-23 20:44:09] <+dubbnn> its not fun for casuals anymore
[2022-12-23 20:44:10] <hugemale69only> do you think overwatch 2 has a better ranked system right now?
[2022-12-23 20:44:11] <%stodgiestpanda1> winning should auto forgive the entry cost
[2022-12-23 20:44:13] <Pr2Hack> all you really need to focus on in diamond games for this map is to watch for 3rds. people overcommit in fights
[2022-12-23 20:44:14] <equippedleek18> false you all called for change
[2022-12-23 20:44:16] <the_norf> ranked is like a running simulator
[2022-12-23 20:44:19] <Ryder_Rogfps> @hiswattson That is not the reason in aisa the servers never works ddos cheaters 400ping how can prople play

[2022-12-23 20:45:15] <Medjay_Mart> For me ranked is like the same difficulty from bronze through plat then it just gets impossible so theres no middle ground to improve
[2022-12-23 20:45:16] <%Tiny215_> you guys were getting int'd by 10k's and thats when you guys got your changes

Your mom didn't have to give you pocket money but she did and you still had to say thank you. It's the same concept, don't be arrogant for nothing you'll loose everything!

[2022-12-23 21:29:47] <karateface> Well there is the fact that you’re playing duel shotguns so you’re most effective at close range.
[2022-12-23 21:29:50] <itstherealricksanchez> @dan_george_92 how does he play selfish?
[2022-12-23 21:29:51] <sir_2raw> did you know that your teammate is like that
