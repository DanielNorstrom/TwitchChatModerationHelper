His quote was, "In a world where you can be anything, be kind." His name was OGSnowflake. PUBG decided to add his logo to Erangel. Its on a wall in Pochinki.

[2022-12-08 16:57:03] <%+nalovo> how hambinoo so experience in this kind of stuff?
[2022-12-08 16:57:03] <%H3ROnimus> oh thats right...now i remember you saying that

[2022-12-08 16:57:07] <%J_BIZZ> hi papa hambWave
[2022-12-08 16:57:12] <%el_hermit> could rephrase it to "most unfortunate place to be when mollyd" :p
[2022-12-08 16:57:18] <%ghostex36> That case is a work of art
[2022-12-08 16:57:21] <%mattymams> @gorecreator I think if they added aim assist, console players would riot. That's the best part of the game
[2022-12-08 16:57:22] <%gorecreator> Yeah, I ain't gonna lie. Warzones playerbase would be nice
[2022-12-08 16:57:34] <%stev07m> Wasssup
[2022-12-08 16:57:37] <%H3ROnimus> yeah at this point, what does anyone have to lose by xplatform
[2022-12-08 16:57:45] <%gorecreator> Stacked lobbies at 3am Kreygasm
[2022-12-08 16:57:58] <%mattymams> Come to console and you'll experience that
[2022-12-08 16:58:02] <%mattymams> LUL
[2022-12-08 16:58:11] <%khiljaezpz> as a controller player, they already reduced the recoil for controller players - I'd rather have that than aim assist personally
[2022-12-08 16:58:17] <RohitShekhawat> everyone in chat is subbed. damn
[2022-12-08 16:58:17] <%J_BIZZ> i mean if they cross-overed xbox and ps4, how much more would it take to bring it all together?
[2022-12-08 16:58:20] <+therealkelsier> cross console everything but ranked, it would be H O T (drops all day)
[2022-12-08 16:58:24] <%MelodicFungus22> Good good good good morning

[2022-12-08 16:59:10] <%SeaofRed_> @therealkelsier  of Xplatform brings back NA ranked I wouldnt care.

[2022-12-08 17:02:41] <%khiljaezpz> 11,000 hours at an average of 20 minutes per game would be 33,000 games
[2022-12-08 17:03:11] <@%$Rivv3r> Ham did you see what PUBG did for OG Snoflake?  Put his logo on one of the walls in the new Vikendi?  Pretty cool to see stuff like that imo

[2022-12-08 17:03:37] <%mppj> @Rivv3r Droo mentioned that earlier. Really cool

[2022-12-08 17:05:21] <%BronX33> Sox pulled in a player from Japan on a large contract like 5 years 80 mill
[2022-12-08 17:05:25] <%+Peterocc> If not Map select, then a proper revive system
[2022-12-08 17:05:30] <%BronX33> I think he's an outfielder
[2022-12-08 17:05:33] <MILLAMOTH> Hello, are you enjoying rank?
[2022-12-08 17:05:41] <%+jeep00xj> Aaron Judge gotba hell of a deal
[2022-12-08 17:05:52] <%gorecreator> I am 100% a revive system. Already seeing it in Vikendi. Encourages timidity. Just my opinion
[2022-12-08 17:05:57] <%gorecreator> against a revive system
[2022-12-08 17:06:01] <@%$Rivv3r> You had 109k kills back in Sept
[2022-12-08 17:06:05] <%khiljaezpz> 11,000 hours * 60 / 29728 = 22.20 minute average per game
[2022-12-08 17:06:13] <%khiljaezpz> you can tell by that, that the average placement is high
[2022-12-08 17:06:16] <%$2hypnoticz> that doesn't count Plznoreport tho right?
[2022-12-08 17:06:20] <jimmywango> I would take 14 percent win rate
[2022-12-08 17:06:27] <%J_BIZZ> @2hypnoticz correct
[2022-12-08 17:06:28] <%MelodicFungus22> Their homegrown shortstop just signed with the Padres. 11 years 280 mil
[2022-12-08 17:06:29] <%mppj> @gorecreator that's odd b/c it should encourage the exact opposite.
[2022-12-08 17:06:34] <%+BWeese> 7k matches for me.
[2022-12-08 17:06:38] <%$2hypnoticz> gotcha
[2022-12-08 17:07:51] <%$2hypnoticz> we'd have to add the 2 to get the real number. unless ham has another alt account LUL
[2022-12-08 17:07:51] <%gorecreator> @mppj just my opinion, I know it's not popular, and most people want a revive. Last man standing 1v4 is exciting. With revive it's encouraged to always run
[2022-12-08 17:07:57] <%$Craigv302> Kobe
[2022-12-08 17:07:58] <mottomata> great nade

[2022-12-08 17:08:41] <%+GirthingDeepWithinYou> @2hypnoticz  plznoreport has 746 games played with another 3,144 kills
[2022-12-08 17:09:36] <%$2hypnoticz> @girthingdeepwithinyou Dang thanks brother, yeah that a lot of PUBG holy moly
[2022-12-08 17:09:40] <%+GirthingDeepWithinYou> so yeah actually ham you cross the 30k game threshold with plznoreport added
[2022-12-08 17:09:56] <+MrBrink10> Judge? What about San Diego signing Xander for 11 years lmao
[2022-12-08 17:10:06] <+MrBrink10> $275
[2022-12-08 17:10:09] <@%safefireshtf> @gorecreator Im in the same camp as you. The knock system without revive encourages you to sell out to save your team mate.
[2022-12-08 17:10:26] <%BronX33> Turner 10 years 300 mill
[2022-12-08 17:10:27] <!%+TheEmergeNC> i mean my mets signed verlander for more per year

[2022-12-08 17:10:37] <MILLAMOTH> What about TREA? Didn’t go to SD😂
[2022-12-08 17:10:40] <%+therealkelsier> damn how petty you gotta be to hit the tires on the way out lol

[2022-12-08 17:10:44] <%osombie_actual> So sad to see turner and Belli go
[2022-12-08 17:10:45] <%$2hypnoticz> I believe ham did most of his ranked gameplay as PLZnoreport as well
[2022-12-08 17:10:51] <%ghostex36> @theemergenc Verlander is a Met now? Hmmm…

[2022-12-08 17:13:51] <+MrBrink10> As much as I wanted Boegarts in Chicago, I'm glad we didn't give 11yrs to a 30yr old shortstop
[2022-12-08 17:13:52] <%gorecreator> @safefireshtf also using a knock as bait isn't as effective. Why risk a push when he gets a do over?

[2022-12-08 17:27:11] <%lyraeone> welcome brotha
[2022-12-08 17:27:34] <+qwertp_22> imo PUBG has a fundamental problem, they have too many maps, instead on focusing on movement and overall smoothness of the gameplay
[2022-12-08 17:27:52] <+qwertp_22> unlike fortinte, apex or warzone (only one map)
[2022-12-08 17:28:12] <%$2hypnoticz> who was the 4th in ranked, I didn't recognize the voice
[2022-12-08 17:28:21] <%lyraeone> imo the map rotation keeps it spicey
[2022-12-08 17:28:25] <%MYERNLANSKI> The variety of maps is probably a big reason the player base is as big as it is still.

[2022-12-08 17:28:57] <%lyraeone> also, the slower movement allows older people like me to adjust and still be dangerous with shooting technique :)
[2022-12-08 17:29:15] <%MYERNLANSKI> This game is 5+ years old. The fact it’s still going this strong is impressive.
[2022-12-08 17:29:16] <%$2hypnoticz> @meignframer @ghostex36 Thanks boys hambLove
[2022-12-08 17:29:21] <+qwertp_22> but it feels clunky, like an old game @lyraeone
[2022-12-08 17:29:24] <%ghostex36> No prob @2hypnoticz
[2022-12-08 17:29:29] <%gorecreator> PUBG has a ton of problems, but it's still my favorite game
[2022-12-08 17:29:55] <%gorecreator> niiiice
[2022-12-08 17:29:57] <%SeaofRed_> hambOoo
[2022-12-08 17:30:01] <%lyraeone> it feela more realistic, if you move like in call of dookie you have broken your back 3 times over already LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 17:30:15] <%ghostex36> Also @2hypnoticz nothing has been confirmed for the UE5 rumors…pretty sure it was another classic Krafton jebait. I’ll believe it when I see it deal.
[2022-12-08 17:30:46] <+qwertp_22> yes, cod is to fast and too much frenzy for me, I literally get dizzy playing cod

[2022-12-08 17:31:07] <%lyraeone> but I understand what you are saying, we all agree on this. however the slower movement and focus on weapon technique makes it still the best BR for me
[2022-12-08 17:31:59] <%sergioys32> WHAT'S
[2022-12-08 17:31:59] <%lyraeone> no its not good, but its paced towards my preference
[2022-12-08 17:32:00] <+qwertp_22> yes, it's slow, clunky and not smooth. that's my main problem. it feels like a ps2 game compared to modern shooters. the gunplay is top tier though
[2022-12-08 17:32:14] <%bust_____> PUBG has the best movement of any game, hands down

[2022-12-08 17:32:35] <%gorecreator> I like the movement. The shittiness adds a lot of nuance

[2022-12-08 17:32:56] <%lyraeone> yeah but getting stuck and bouncing on shit is just buggy, if they smooth that you'd probably still says its slow

[2022-12-08 17:39:23] <%ghostex36> Is Castle or Villa still hot drop locations?
[2022-12-08 17:39:50] <%gorecreator> Castle and Villa are further from the center now, and it seems like they cooled down
[2022-12-08 17:40:01] <%$2hypnoticz> @melodicfungus22 Oh I feel ya bud, good on you for staying on task hambLove
[2022-12-08 17:40:28] <%gorecreator> I used to like hot Podvosto

[2022-12-08 17:41:34] <%ghostex36> I consider myself a casual…still dropped Castle every now and again. It was fun.
[2022-12-08 17:42:00] <%gorecreator> I don't people talk enough about how you need a good PC to properly hot drop IMO
[2022-12-08 17:42:03] <%ghostex36> @myernlanski No…Abbey, Kreznic, Mt. Kreznic all gone.

[2022-12-08 17:42:51] <%gorecreator> I'm a Vikendi boomer
[2022-12-08 17:42:53] <%khiljaezpz> or castle

[2022-12-08 17:43:15] <%$2hypnoticz> Plus all the other maps concentrate movement to the center
[2022-12-08 17:43:16] <%gorecreator> a double kill is a double kill
[2022-12-08 17:43:32] <%ghostex36> Exactly…it’s freakin’ weird some of the decisions they made. I still remember when they took a couple of buildings out in Pod and kind of ruined it.
[2022-12-08 17:43:39] <%gorecreator> I saw a guy kill himself with a mortar a few weeks ago. Like bruh
[2022-12-08 17:43:41] <%+therealkelsier> goroka always in our hearts
[2022-12-08 17:44:03] <%H3ROnimus> No more Mt Krezie?
[2022-12-08 17:44:09] <%ghostex36> @lyraeone Yep…that’s actually it. That was one of my primary drop spots. I hate that it’s gone.
[2022-12-08 17:44:15] <%ghostex36> @h3ronimus Nope
[2022-12-08 17:44:17] <%MYERNLANSKI> @h3ronimus nah I just asked
[2022-12-08 17:44:19] <%gorecreator> It's only been a short while. I feel we need to play more games to get a solid opinion aboutnew Vikendi
[2022-12-08 17:44:31] <%+therealkelsier> @H3ROnimus but we got panzer ski lifts so im cool with it
[2022-12-08 17:44:33] <+mjbutler4> rofl
[2022-12-08 17:44:51] <%gorecreator> Same downside as the emergency drop. Get in, but no car
[2022-12-08 17:45:01] <%lyraeone> there was also Tovar at some point, next to castle
[2022-12-08 17:45:14] <%+therealkelsier> they did on erengal too for the ferrys, you can now get a car on it
[2022-12-08 17:45:23] <%+big_gamer71> yo a car on the gondola that's sick
[2022-12-08 17:45:23] <%bust_____> Obi had a sick C4 kill on the gondola last night
[2022-12-08 17:45:31] <%ghostex36> No Peshkova, Krichas, Dobo Mestro, Kreznic, Abbey, Podvosto, Goroka…but HEY, we still have Cosmodrome! Let’s go!!!

[2022-12-08 18:01:31] <%+methbadger18> oh man
[2022-12-08 18:01:35] <%$KozysCorner> Hello Ham, hi chat wishing, you all the best Lets Gooooooo
[2022-12-08 18:01:35] <%+elf___> blech
[2022-12-08 18:01:42] <@%safefireshtf> @khiljaezpz Better than the processed breads.
[2022-12-08 18:01:46] <%khiljaezpz> @safefireshtf great principle though
[2022-12-08 18:01:54] <+jetlii__> Cod pro tried pubg I see
[2022-12-08 18:01:56] <%khiljaezpz> @safefireshtf oh ya 100% I just meant there's a lot of cookies there hehe
[2022-12-08 18:02:07] <%prest0_> indifference, mostly
[2022-12-08 18:02:23] <%cheetoburrito> @methbadger18 the idea of a meth badger getting after me is a  scary one! I like the name  hambWw
[2022-12-08 18:02:26] <@%safefireshtf> @khiljaezpz Sure, you could nit pick it to death. Just a general rule of them.
[2022-12-08 18:02:26] <+nbower92> wish theyd fix up a revive system and at least give it a damn shot. i think theyd be surprised if they do it right.
[2022-12-08 18:02:30] <jvcob_s> I only watch people who keep it a buck
[2022-12-08 18:02:36] <%+GirthingDeepWithinYou> i would never cheat on you with another streamer ham LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 18:02:39] <%MYERNLANSKI> @cheetoburrito it’s like the cocaine bear lol
[2022-12-08 18:02:44] <%$KozysCorner> hambDinner
[2022-12-08 18:02:45] <%+elf___> my friends are all done with it
[2022-12-08 18:02:46] <%khiljaezpz> @safefireshtf wasn't trying to nitpick sorry - I did agree that it's a great principle
[2022-12-08 18:02:47] <%prest0_> yeah exactly, not worth the energy giving feedback / discussing anymore
[2022-12-08 18:02:47] <%$2hypnoticz> Not too much carbs or preservatives, I stay away from as well
[2022-12-08 18:02:50] <%ghostex36> I haven’t played it yet…but when Wacky says he doesn’t like it, that should tell you something.
[2022-12-08 18:02:58] <%MYERNLANSKI> Meth badger vs Cocaine Bear who ya got
[2022-12-08 18:03:06] <%drop_dead_fred_> The ones I watch definitely voice their displeasure
[2022-12-08 18:03:13] <%cheetoburrito> would you rather 5 meth badgers after you or 1 coke bear? @MYERNLANSKI hambOoo
[2022-12-08 18:03:17] <%prest0_> that's how I am too LUL
[2022-12-08 18:03:28] <%cheetoburrito> hehe
[2022-12-08 18:03:30] <%MYERNLANSKI> @cheetoburrito ooo that’s tough, probably still going cocaine bear
[2022-12-08 18:03:34] <%+methbadger18> @MYERNLANSKI Clearly the Badger..>Come on
[2022-12-08 18:03:38] <%ghostex36> @myernlanski Meth Badger…that thing ain’t gonna care. It’s just gonna tear.
[2022-12-08 18:03:45] <@%safefireshtf> @2hypnoticz Eating low carb is so beneficial to me personally, but damn is it hard to stay on. Especially in a hurry
[2022-12-08 18:03:49] <%$KozysCorner> alot of questions i read about the new pubg
[2022-12-08 18:03:52] <%tack_driver83> choco was probably one of the only other streamers who i watched that picked apart the game but he doesn't play anymore.
[2022-12-08 18:03:53] <%khiljaezpz> Have enough Meth to bribe them to death
[2022-12-08 18:03:59] <%cheetoburrito> I think I take the bear too!
[2022-12-08 18:04:07] <ShoreHead2212> Not to be a dick but do you only play this game because of views. Or do you still truly love this game over any other game right now. Just wondering thank you
[2022-12-08 18:04:14] <%+GirthingDeepWithinYou> what type of bear?? black bear maybe... grizzly or polar bears are a different level
[2022-12-08 18:04:45] <%+methbadger18> to bad for me my PubG game sucks so it's only the name that's scary.....
[2022-12-08 18:04:50] <%cheetoburrito> @GirthingDeepWithinYou that coke bear was in Tennessee, right? so I think it was a black bear
[2022-12-08 18:04:50] <%khiljaezpz> How about Bath Salts Alligator
[2022-12-08 18:04:57] <%MYERNLANSKI> LUL
[2022-12-08 18:05:04] <%ghostex36> I’m probably the only one who cares, but Danawa retained Salute and seoul…with Inonix rumors swirling. Jesus, that roster would be cracked.
[2022-12-08 18:05:07] <%MYERNLANSKI> Maybe a croc @khiljaezpz
[2022-12-08 18:05:16] <!%$Droobeedoobeedoo> Good news is YOU have the IT factor
[2022-12-08 18:05:18] <%$2hypnoticz> On swat from the bear will take out like 3 badgers LUL Plus bears can take a bullet and keep on ticking. They'll probably just get more angry
[2022-12-08 18:05:23] <%+kmn62> I find it hard to watch anything else but PubG
[2022-12-08 18:05:24] <%jalls37> I couldn’t agree more lol
[2022-12-08 18:05:32] <%$2hypnoticz> One swat*
[2022-12-08 18:05:41] <%+methbadger18> What happens if you drive the car out of the tram mid air?
[2022-12-08 18:05:43] <%jalls37> I only play about 2 to 3 hrs a night
[2022-12-08 18:05:53] <%+krzfl069> my pc doesnt run warzone2.0 :(
[2022-12-08 18:05:53] <%$KozysCorner> you said it all perfectly lol
[2022-12-08 18:05:57] <%indifferentdave> I have been enjoying watching the WZ2 content for sure, even though it's a way different game to watch
[2022-12-08 18:06:01] <%gorecreator> Ham doesn't complain 24/7 and gives credit where do, which lends credibility to his complaints IMO
[2022-12-08 18:06:01] <%ghostex36> @methbadger18 Content
[2022-12-08 18:06:05] <%+elf___> when keepin it real goes wrong...
[2022-12-08 18:06:06] <jvcob_s> I’m at about 2-3 hours a month of pubg now
[2022-12-08 18:06:06] <%gorecreator> due*
[2022-12-08 18:06:26] <%$2hypnoticz> PUBG seems easy to keep up with chat to.
[2022-12-08 18:06:39] <%+krzfl069> when i play its 8 h
[2022-12-08 18:06:42] <%$2hypnoticz> Well easier*
[2022-12-08 18:06:44] <%gorecreator> I get decision fatigue after 4 hours
[2022-12-08 18:06:57] <kv1nny> so you are saying no 24 hr stream????
[2022-12-08 18:06:57] <%khiljaezpz> I'm a lazy bitch with no real responsibility on the weekend, so I used to play 8+ on the weekends
[2022-12-08 18:07:06] <%+elf___> chappelle show reference...
[2022-12-08 18:07:12] <%khiljaezpz> but now WZ2 has taken it's place
[2022-12-08 18:07:22] <%+elf___> i'm old
[2022-12-08 18:07:22] <%+krzfl069> i could play all day long if i didnt have kids
[2022-12-08 18:07:26] <%$KozysCorner> 3 hours of pub for me then warzone till i cant see hahaha
[2022-12-08 18:07:33] <%+Bacololo> Afternoon binooooooooooo good vibes
[2022-12-08 18:07:34] <%tack_driver83> too much of a good thing type scenario, like me and chocolate, its not good for you. LUL
[2022-12-08 18:08:12] <%brandonmize94> I literally don’t even own a gaming pc, never played PUBG other than on mobile and I enjoy the variety just bc it keeps the vibes high, not so much in a rut regardless of viewer count. That’s just a take from someone who doesn’t game just watches for enjoyment
[2022-12-08 18:08:14] <%prest0_> there's no cover besides compounds on the map lol
[2022-12-08 18:08:26] <%cheetoburrito> hambBop central cee

[2022-12-08 18:08:52] <%+krzfl069> i watch ham here to get better because he is better then me for sure
[2022-12-08 18:08:53] <%ghostex36> @brandonmize94 Variety is the spice of life. No lie…I love it when streamers like ham do some variety.
[2022-12-08 18:08:58] <%$2hypnoticz> PUBG and WOW community's seem like they don't want their streamer to play any other game. There's probably other game community's like that to
[2022-12-08 18:08:59] <%indifferentdave> I would think the variety of games in stream would lead to potentially more partnerships with other streamers as well as more viewers based on different games (but I could be totally wrong)
[2022-12-08 18:09:07] <+nbower92> you see jon jones vs ngannou 285? and khamzat agreed to a fight with pereira, hes waiting on him to agree.  lol
[2022-12-08 18:09:07] <%+krzfl069> i get better by watching
[2022-12-08 18:09:23] <jvcob_s> I just realized all the compounds got removed
[2022-12-08 18:09:25] <%+robwwwz> good man , how are things going for you ?

[2022-12-08 18:10:15] <%gorecreator> Personal drama aside, I think we are all dying to see jones at heavyweight
[2022-12-08 18:10:28] <%+Bacololo> You watch a lot of UFC @hambinooo ?
[2022-12-08 18:10:28] <%+lailai4u> goodddayy bino and chatt
[2022-12-08 18:10:46] <%MYERNLANSKI> @gorecreator it’s been so long since we’ve seen him idk what to expect
[2022-12-08 18:11:08] <+nbower92> gah, im ready to see jones fight again. blaydes or ngannou
[2022-12-08 18:11:10] <%gorecreator> @MYERNLANSKI yeah, I'd be okay to see an MMA masterclass, or if he gets blasted. Either way I'm good
[2022-12-08 18:11:21] <jvcob_s> I think he’ll be good but don’t expect him to be where he was at
[2022-12-08 18:11:30] <+nbower92> exactly.
[2022-12-08 18:11:34] <%+Bacololo> Buddy I train with won last card (Philly Fresh) and I have my buddy fighting on the 10th (Steven Koslow) @hambinooo
[2022-12-08 18:11:49] <%+zeosnake> i want to see jon jone vs cyril gane
[2022-12-08 18:11:55] <%MYERNLANSKI> Wonder how much he weighs, and how much speed he’s lost being a lot bigger
[2022-12-08 18:12:04] <%+krzfl069> wish gsp would still fight

[2022-12-08 18:17:20] <%+Bacololo> Just not sold on the competition Magomed has walked through. Beats Oezd which was ok, Santos I believe still suffering from knee problems, and Smith who is almost relegated as a gate keeper now. I think this is definitely his biggest challenge/opportunity to prove something @hambinooo

[2022-12-08 18:18:43] <%+Bacololo> I think Magomed actually handles him on the wrestling. I just think Jan has very good ring experience to be the better fighter overall. Just experience honestly
[2022-12-08 18:18:48] <%gorecreator> his loss to glover was shocking. Not cuz he lost, but how\

[2022-12-08 18:45:09] <dogg100kg> how u take off with that glider ? =))
[2022-12-08 18:45:38] <!%$Droobeedoobeedoo> I really wish they would run the featured queue for like 3 days and then merge.
[2022-12-08 18:47:10] <%+lailai4u> just butter
[2022-12-08 18:47:50] <%$typicaluser> I'm blamin Crutch for that one
[2022-12-08 18:48:03] <%Craiginator720> New vikendi < old vikendi
[2022-12-08 18:48:05] <%khiljaezpz> @Droobeedoobeedoo I wish they'd just make the 'featured' map the only option for a few days and then merge it into normal queue
[2022-12-08 18:48:14] <%+Throne0> Yeah I'm really not enjoying how many buildings they are putting around hot drops now
[2022-12-08 18:48:15] <%+Throne0> its frustrating
[2022-12-08 18:48:25] <%+Throne0> like main building train station is pretty cool
[2022-12-08 18:48:36] <%+Throne0> but then all the outskirts are too much imo
[2022-12-08 18:48:52] <%+Throne0> yup
[2022-12-08 18:49:00] <%+Throne0> you can tell its made by the same team as TAEGO
[2022-12-08 18:49:06] <%+Throne0> looking at places like terminal
[2022-12-08 18:49:13] <%+IJustLikeHockey> Platform 9 3/4.
[2022-12-08 18:49:25] <%ghostex36> @khiljaezpz How about no featured queue…just bump the appearance percentage higher for Vikendi in the Random queue.
[2022-12-08 18:49:34] <%khiljaezpz> @ghostex36 that would work for me as well
[2022-12-08 18:50:06] <%khiljaezpz> any of the ideas are better than the current system of splitting the already struggling queues
[2022-12-08 18:50:17] <%+big_gamer71> lots to unpack in this area lots going on
[2022-12-08 18:50:25] <%+therealkelsier> does the fire kill you on the volcano?
[2022-12-08 18:50:27] <%ghostex36> @khiljaezpz The only thing that would be terrible about that is…you’ll still see more Taego than you want. LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 18:50:45] <%khiljaezpz> I'll take taego over miramar everyday

[2022-12-08 22:38:47] <%bust_____> if you lose gulag, can you still be bought back in?
[2022-12-08 22:38:48] <%khiljaezpz> I want a poll (Crutch or Corky: who's more entertaining)

[2022-12-08 22:42:59] <%bust_____> blessing and a curse is right. you aint gotta go no place, but everyone at your place and you just cant leave when you want
[2022-12-08 22:43:19] <%khiljaezpz> I leave it on to see the voice notifications, but turned the volume down to 2 so that it's not annoying
[2022-12-08 22:43:36] <%khiljaezpz> can't all talk get you in trouble if people say racists shit in all chat?
[2022-12-08 22:43:41] <%khiljaezpz> as a streamer that is
[2022-12-08 22:43:59] <%khiljaezpz> I never hear it tbh
[2022-12-08 22:44:01] <%GetRichieOrDie> @khiljaezpz was about to ask why you were so worried about that LUL
[2022-12-08 22:44:07] <%khiljaezpz> ok good - I heard you could, but I'ma take your word :)
[2022-12-08 22:44:35] <%khiljaezpz> just something I read about a streamer getting banned on twitch for something said on his stream, not by him
[2022-12-08 22:44:45] <%khiljaezpz> like I said, I'ma take your word :)
[2022-12-08 22:44:52] <%+generaldeluxo> @hambinooo  How big is this map compared to Mirimar or Vikinkdi?
[2022-12-08 22:44:55] <%+generaldeluxo> Seems massive
[2022-12-08 22:44:58] <%khiljaezpz> so that makes a difference, got ya
[2022-12-08 22:45:25] <%khiljaezpz> makes sense to me - was just curious
[2022-12-08 22:45:39] <%bust_____> who is this BigRips guy?
[2022-12-08 22:45:49] <%khiljaezpz> kind of a dumb questions I guess... considering you turned it on - derp
[2022-12-08 22:46:05] <%GetRichieOrDie> i havent played or seen new vikendi yet
[2022-12-08 22:46:31] <%GetRichieOrDie> is it still test servers or live @generaldeluxo
[2022-12-08 22:46:55] <%GetRichieOrDie> i always liked vikendi...
[2022-12-08 22:47:27] <%GetRichieOrDie> ill give it a shot friday night
[2022-12-08 22:49:15] <%khiljaezpz> To put map size in perspective - Sanhok is approximately 200% the size of Warzone 2 map
[2022-12-08 22:49:24] <%khiljaezpz> in a square meter comparison
[2022-12-08 22:49:34] <%khiljaezpz> and warzone 2 map is larger than both warzone 1 maps
[2022-12-08 22:49:35] <%GetRichieOrDie> @khiljaezpz wtf really?
[2022-12-08 22:49:39] <%khiljaezpz> @GetRichieOrDie yup
[2022-12-08 22:49:51] <%GetRichieOrDie> mind blown
[2022-12-08 22:50:25] <%khiljaezpz> which would make erangel almost 4x as larger
[2022-12-08 22:50:39] <%+sudZtheGreat> LOL
[2022-12-08 22:50:50] <%khiljaezpz> damn ham... where I get dem hax bro?!
[2022-12-08 22:51:07] <%+sudZtheGreat> LOL that ragdoll....weeeeeee

[2022-12-08 22:51:52] <%+sudZtheGreat> God I love COD all chat... fills me up every time
[2022-12-08 22:52:07] <%GTnTN23> this shit is wild
[2022-12-08 22:52:30] <%GetRichieOrDie> the prox chat isnt directional is it? doesnt sound like it
[2022-12-08 22:53:05] <%+sudZtheGreat> nope not directional
[2022-12-08 22:53:20] <%+sudZtheGreat> "you guys are pussies"  *Forest Gump running meme*
[2022-12-08 22:53:24] <jacob_t34> pretty excited for vikendi to come to console, didnt play it much when it was available
[2022-12-08 22:53:57] <PsychoSocialxX> I mean thats a valid move but calling others pussies then doing that pepeLaugh
[2022-12-08 22:54:00] <%GetRichieOrDie> @sudZtheGreat which is why its so much different to spam chat to cover footsteps, in pubg its directional so doesnt work as good
[2022-12-08 22:54:49] <%jgappy420> Let’s get it ham
[2022-12-08 22:54:57] <%+sudZtheGreat> yeah I have my ingame voip at about 5% volume for that reason
[2022-12-08 22:55:18] <%+sudZtheGreat> these guys all have $3 radioshack discount mics that are shoved down their throats lol
[2022-12-08 22:55:20] <%GetRichieOrDie> @sudZtheGreat ill try 5 i have just muted but it is more fun to talk shit
[2022-12-08 22:56:08] <%GetRichieOrDie> "purple fucks" LUL
[2022-12-08 22:56:45] <%+sudZtheGreat> way more fun! I like to ask dead teams what the most recent Fortnite patch is like...

[2022-12-08 22:58:29] <%khiljaezpz> Crutch is the best Ham counterpart IMO
[2022-12-08 22:58:40] <%GetRichieOrDie> yeah crutch was good there haha

[2022-12-08 22:59:31] <%khiljaezpz> Welcome back @ItsAMemeYouDip :)
[2022-12-08 23:00:06] <%GetRichieOrDie> so what are the three zones like that? been trying to wait to see if someone else asks but hasnt happened
[2022-12-08 23:00:08] <%ItsAMemeYouDip> LOL your body got YEETED
[2022-12-08 23:00:28] <%+sudZtheGreat> yeeted like a TSM logo in January
[2022-12-08 23:00:50] <%khiljaezpz> @GetRichieOrDie this has dynamic zones - sometimes they split into 2, sometimes they split into 3 - then they recombine back into 1 on the next phase
[2022-12-08 23:01:01] <%khiljaezpz> sometimes they just goto the next 1 circle instead of splitting
[2022-12-08 23:01:32] <%GetRichieOrDie> @khiljaezpz is it new to the BR and only on random matches or a specific game mode they are playing?
[2022-12-08 23:01:35] [Notification] wooderson subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! [hambLove hambLove hambLove hambLove hambLove]

[2022-12-08 23:01:42] <%khiljaezpz> then the last few circles pick a location outside of the current circle, and they move and shrink towards the next one
[2022-12-08 23:01:59] <%khiljaezpz> @GetRichieOrDie it's new to this BR and it's Warzone 2 (not a special mode) just standard
[2022-12-08 23:02:36] <%GetRichieOrDie> ok i get it
[2022-12-08 23:02:42] <%khiljaezpz> and ya it's random
[2022-12-08 23:03:35] <%khiljaezpz> I'm enjoying WZ2 so more than I thought I would.
[2022-12-08 23:04:05] <%+sudZtheGreat> I'm enjoying it because it's not a broken movement crackhead fest this time around
[2022-12-08 23:04:06] <%khiljaezpz> Thought the dynamic circles were a bad idea, and was a little peeved - I was very wrong - rather enjoy it in practice
[2022-12-08 23:04:18] <+Bwillpoker> yo whats is the gooods
[2022-12-08 23:04:23] <%khiljaezpz> @sudZtheGreat wait until people catch on to how to dolphin hop - if it doesn't get patched
[2022-12-08 23:04:37] <%khiljaezpz> dolphin hopping is worse than slide canceling ever thought of being
[2022-12-08 23:04:50] <%khiljaezpz> fly through the air like superman with the ability to shoot while flying haha
[2022-12-08 23:04:55] <%+sudZtheGreat> yeah I mean slide cancelling wasn't BROKEN... it was just stupid
[2022-12-08 23:04:56] <%khiljaezpz> true :)

[2022-12-08 23:06:02] <%khiljaezpz> thanks amigo
[2022-12-08 23:06:09] <+Bwillpoker> did they add trios?
[2022-12-08 23:06:35] <%+sudZtheGreat> DMZ is trios... I'm loving that game mode
[2022-12-08 23:06:36] <%khiljaezpz> ya they have unhinged trios - 3rd person perspective
[2022-12-08 23:06:43] <%khiljaezpz> @sudZtheGreat didn't even think about that
[2022-12-08 23:07:36] <%+sudZtheGreat> My noob buddies can't handle WZ2... it's just too intense and sweaty for them. in DMZ they get to crush AI, get their loot fix and feel good, while I solo wipe trios like a hero. It's tons of fun.
[2022-12-08 23:09:06] <%GetRichieOrDie> ive only played solos, didnt wanna get paired with a duo that gets pissed at me until i understand it all haha
[2022-12-08 23:09:39] <+Bwillpoker> sudZ - make it a game to get top 10, and try to camp someone and ruin their night..
[2022-12-08 23:09:51] <+Bwillpoker> makes BR more enjoyable to not play for 1st
