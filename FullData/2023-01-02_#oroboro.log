[2023-01-02 02:59:27] <powerless_imp0> also the way the story is woven into the gameplay is absolutely wonderful, might not be the first time it's been done but I think they've done it better than anyone

[2023-01-02 03:13:08] <powerless_imp0> that is true
[2023-01-02 03:13:09] <l_shadow177> and needs the artemis dash for moar damage
[2023-01-02 03:13:14] <LoonyNo7> artemis dash would be much better if we can find it, better weak is probably the way
[2023-01-02 03:13:14] <Mrhuggles> Frost would be nicer for attack because of it's stack - that's the type of thing he's looking for.

[2023-01-02 03:17:49] <%keeran8894> IMPORTANT: hope this isn't backseating but there is a bug with that aspect. dash uppercut resets the hit counter but does not get the extra damage benefit.

[2023-01-02 03:46:57] <MadnessMarker> have you ever gotten any dual boons?
[2023-01-02 03:47:01] <+Pdubbery> fiiiishhhh
[2023-01-02 03:47:02] <chiyo721> You'll have enough with side hustle to buy it all, or you could save for the blood
[2023-01-02 03:47:16] <%Accer666> Cast are stronk
[2023-01-02 03:47:20] <LoonyNo7> possibly could buy the blood if you full clear styx?
[2023-01-02 03:47:21] <ChrisKensei> Hermes could be faster special
[2023-01-02 03:47:24] <Lilguyfinish> which cast do you have tho? aphro is amazing damage wise but the range makes it hard to use when you have other options. great for bursting bosses only basically
[2023-01-02 03:47:26] <+derek3891> OK thanks @loonyno7
[2023-01-02 03:47:28] <l_shadow177> 🐟

[2023-01-02 03:48:05] <l_shadow177> i use casts all day it helps for the extra damage when stacking it on bosses

[2023-01-02 03:48:27] <Tylerjsmith97> @SteampunkRuinN ive never gotten past asphodel with em LUL
[2023-01-02 03:48:29] <LoonyNo7> i mean it's 10 rooms worth right
[2023-01-02 03:48:30] <powerless_imp0> are you really going to do 10 more chambers
[2023-01-02 03:48:33] <!AuroraUnit486> don't sell hustle and just do more chambers and buy all the shops
[2023-01-02 03:48:35] <Lilguyfinish> its worth I think... 160/16 is 10 chambers so
[2023-01-02 03:48:36] <Tylerjsmith97> @chiyo721 guan yu

[2023-01-02 03:48:54] <!AuroraUnit486> GAMBA
[2023-01-02 03:48:55] <Lilguyfinish> I'd sell
[2023-01-02 03:48:55] <SweetyRock> I think
[2023-01-02 03:48:58] <LoonyNo7> does side hustle per room get +50% with the poisidon boon you got though
[2023-01-02 03:49:05] <l_shadow177> sell it u might get enough money near the end
[2023-01-02 03:49:09] <ArcHeRHooD> what would u buy?
[2023-01-02 03:49:10] <!%Ebonslayer> @huntera18 10 minute timeout.
[2023-01-02 03:49:13] <Ibadss> dosnt he get like 10 per room?
[2023-01-02 03:49:17] <%keeran8894> at this point it wouldn't give you much worth, would it?
[2023-01-02 03:49:18] <MadnessMarker> how much do you have currently?
[2023-01-02 03:49:18] <Ibadss> with hussle?
[2023-01-02 03:49:22] <l_shadow177> oh nvm
[2023-01-02 03:49:44] <powerless_imp0> it just gave you only 16 on entry so i guess that was  not true
[2023-01-02 03:49:47] <chiyo721> @Tylerjsmith97 Go aphrodite, hope for life affirmation. Demeter is another good pick for guan yu. Aggressively go for hammers over all else
[2023-01-02 03:49:53] <%$hollowstylist> it dont stack with siden tho
[2023-01-02 03:49:57] <!AuroraUnit486> yeah looks like hustle doesnt stack

[2023-01-02 03:51:21] <chiyo721> Ice wine makes casting dio cast a lot easier
[2023-01-02 03:51:21] <MadnessMarker> a duo one, nice
[2023-01-02 03:51:30] <LoonyNo7> ice wine also changes how fast it attacks
[2023-01-02 03:51:37] <!AuroraUnit486> returning to the shop room also gives you side hustle every time lol
[2023-01-02 03:51:42] <$roedtogsvart> need side hustle for that
[2023-01-02 03:51:46] <MadnessMarker> maybe you can still do it

[2023-01-02 03:53:02] <LoonyNo7> this duo cast is one of the best due to the insta cast imo
[2023-01-02 03:54:04] <Fuhier> You can do the side rooms, and typically one of them hides a fish when you get back if you don't get it when you first enter if memory serves sodaHmm

[2023-01-02 04:08:23] <Marshmallum> yes
[2023-01-02 04:08:27] <LoonyNo7> 3 is great for cast builds with the 3x rather than regen cast, not sure you've done one
[2023-01-02 04:08:28] <powerless_imp0> nemesis is absolutely amazing
[2023-01-02 04:08:31] <chiyo721> It's ok, and no it's for the full 3 seconds
[2023-01-02 04:08:33] <+derek3891> the hammer upgrades for the sword are really good

[2023-01-02 04:08:40] <l_shadow177> nemesis is good for crit damage

[2023-01-02 04:09:11] <powerless_imp0> aspect of poseidon is also really good if you spec into it
[2023-01-02 04:09:16] <LoonyNo7> are you aware of the dash special? you start the special then insta dash
