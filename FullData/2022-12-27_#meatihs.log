[2022-12-27 02:29:36] VIEWERS: 1 062
[2022-12-27 02:29:38] <+ShootyGoBang> you'd be responsible for the death of a billion by not changing the course of the trolley
[2022-12-27 02:29:40] <+Pembertonx> but you saved 1 billion..greater good no?
[2022-12-27 02:29:46] <@%+DanTheGreat94> christians kekw
[2022-12-27 02:29:51] <@SteveFrenchHS> not acting is still a choice so you'd technically be responsible anyway
[2022-12-27 02:29:56] <phenixior6> morals come from god and you are an athiest
[2022-12-27 02:30:00] <kandhpok> but as a doctor doesnt inaction to save someone also count as murder?
[2022-12-27 02:30:00] <GuruCurly> @empathful given I can’t see the fact it’s one billion I’d assume it’s the sum of natural numbers and I’d only be killing -1/12 people (less than one person whoa!)
[2022-12-27 02:30:00] <@Norwis_> @gungraved prolly yes, but these questions are pointless
[2022-12-27 02:30:02] <HeeJaw> Lets have a moment of silence...lets try.

[2022-12-27 02:30:19] <+Ryukinshin> I guess the real question would be, if you pulled the lever under the belief that no one would die and it resulted in someone dying, could you live with yourself?

[2022-12-27 02:41:58] <HeeJaw> There is a big difference between solar system of ours and similar solar system size of atom. TIMEWISE. Everyone sees light go as fast according to Einstein and others. On Earth we see LIGHT travel 8 times around Earth in a second. Imagine how long time it would take from atomsolarsystem to go as far?

[2022-12-27 02:43:40] <HeeJaw> So time goes very much faster on atom scale compared to us. That is why i think electromagnetism is so much stronger compared to gravity.

[2022-12-27 22:01:35] <Dragonist> I want to start an ancient Greek themed fight club. I have a gallon of petroleum jelly plenty of olive oil to recreate the pankration in the nude. There is nothing sexual. We can all split a pizza and then fight each other. There are no women allowed within the arena. My uncle is a veterinarian, so we have a doctor on staff. Is there any chance that any of you can host our first tournament? I have $1500 in seed money.
