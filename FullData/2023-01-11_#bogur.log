[2023-01-11 12:06:51] <%OsorkonXV> overwatch bad
[2023-01-11 12:07:14] <%Thevrex> they tie their self worth to the game
[2023-01-11 12:07:20] <%katmosk> @EffortDB are you thankful for me talking history instead of ow balance üôè haha
[2023-01-11 12:07:42] <@%+EffortDB> @Thevrex thats a real bad thing to do, they should realize they have no worth at all
[2023-01-11 12:07:49] <@%+EffortDB> @katmosk yeah haha
[2023-01-11 12:08:00] <%McCream38> people in high rank are always quick to say they are bad. low rank players think theyre gods

[2023-01-11 12:08:04] <%katmosk> haha thank you effort

[2023-01-11 12:08:09] <%OsorkonXV> @Thevrex true, i've been there
[2023-01-11 12:08:10] <+vrawnika> the delusion is real
[2023-01-11 12:08:19] <%+FlyingPotato82> @McCream38 it's the dunning kruger effect isn't it
[2023-01-11 12:08:23] <%katmosk> @vrawnika we live in a society
[2023-01-11 12:08:36] <%+FlyingPotato82> and i'm shit at all of them
[2023-01-11 12:08:40] <%+FlyingPotato82> it's great
[2023-01-11 12:08:44] <@%+EffortDB> potato is based

[2023-01-11 12:08:51] <%+FlyingPotato82> @Blovmag no
[2023-01-11 12:09:00] <+Samurai_Bat> doesn't help to be told you're shit by other players. agreeing with them just nets you some bullying
[2023-01-11 12:09:03] <+Samurai_Bat> but I agree with you!
[2023-01-11 12:09:17] <+Samurai_Bat> also, howdy! ü§†
[2023-01-11 12:09:19] <%universal_mind> happy birthday @bogur boggL
[2023-01-11 12:09:27] <%+FlyingPotato82> @EffortDB likewise ;)
[2023-01-11 12:09:29] <+vrawnika> whenever i play w my friends it‚Äôs insane how their brain turns off like ik u guys are normally smarter than this what happens in ranked PunOko
[2023-01-11 12:09:56] <%katmosk> @Samurai_Bat just say like chill out dude im not that good and theyre gonna feel guilty for insulting a guy who's bad
[2023-01-11 12:10:02] VIEWERS: 77
[2023-01-11 12:10:09] <%McCream38> being good also makes it easier to understand and notice the mistakes you make
[2023-01-11 12:10:21] <@%+PigeonWho> at what point do you think people can have an ego
[2023-01-11 12:10:49] <@%+PigeonWho> egos are fun
[2023-01-11 12:11:02] <%+FlyingPotato82> if it gets you money it's fine
[2023-01-11 12:11:08] <%+FlyingPotato82> but if you're doing it for free there is no point
[2023-01-11 12:11:12] <CHICKEN2XD> Egos are only fun in competitive storyline‚Äôs, other than that it‚Äôs cringe honestly
[2023-01-11 12:11:14] <+Samurai_Bat> @katmosk the last few times I did that I got told "yeah you suck" and was heckled the rest of the game. one time I got told to kill myself
[2023-01-11 12:11:18] <@%+PigeonWho> why are you shieldbotting??????
[2023-01-11 12:11:21] <@%+PigeonWho> >:(
[2023-01-11 12:11:41] <+Samurai_Bat> actually one of those games they called me cute and carried me, but the other few were not good. I do try to be positive, though!
[2023-01-11 12:11:49] <@%+EffortDB> i dont even mind if people have an ego. the problem is these peoples attitudes that they themselves dont do anything wrong
[2023-01-11 12:11:51] <+vrawnika> W strat
[2023-01-11 12:11:54] <@%+PigeonWho> caleb is watching the stream and thinking i do this!!!
[2023-01-11 12:12:02] <%+FlyingPotato82> @Samurai_Bat that's just like a sign of a really toxic community tho
[2023-01-11 12:12:03] VIEWERS: 88
[2023-01-11 12:12:06] <@%+EffortDB> its so fucking annoying interacting with people who put the blame on someone else at all times
[2023-01-11 12:12:08] <%+FlyingPotato82> imagine if you go play basketball or something
[2023-01-11 12:12:13] <+Samurai_Bat> hope I'm not come across as argumentative, bogur and chat. just trying to add to the conversation
[2023-01-11 12:12:17] <%+FlyingPotato82> and you suck and the others are like lol kys
[2023-01-11 12:12:17] <%katmosk> @Samurai_Bat yeah i mean sometimes u get the maddest ppl on the planet but most times ppl think gg go next if they lose and are nice
[2023-01-11 12:12:25] <+vrawnika> ml is very humble
[2023-01-11 12:12:41] <CHICKEN2XD> That is just delusion
[2023-01-11 12:12:43] <%+FlyingPotato82> it's just people hiding behind their usernames, knowing that there is nothing you can do about it and fulfilling their empty lives by flaming
[2023-01-11 12:12:45] <CHICKEN2XD> Not even an ego
[2023-01-11 12:12:49] <@%+EffortDB> @FlyingPotato82 funny thing is this basically never happens in irl sports, especially team sports
[2023-01-11 12:12:51] <ChiralOW> @FlyingPotato82 that'd be so based tbh
[2023-01-11 12:12:53] <%Thevrex> the best players have egos bc theyre all like 17-20 and dumb
[2023-01-11 12:13:06] <@%+EffortDB> because the kids who do it learn very fast that you cant shit talk your team or others
[2023-01-11 12:13:08] <+Samurai_Bat> v silly
[2023-01-11 12:13:08] <@%+EffortDB> it doesnt work
[2023-01-11 12:13:08] <%+FlyingPotato82> @EffortDB ofc cause you'd get beat up lol
[2023-01-11 12:13:13] <@%+EffortDB> ye or that
[2023-01-11 12:13:20] <Ship_Lumity> Bogur what are your opinions on the PvE and when do YOU think it's gonna come out? Like give a date
[2023-01-11 12:13:26] <@%+EffortDB> so me an potato have come to a conclusion
[2023-01-11 12:13:30] <@%+EffortDB> violence is the answer
[2023-01-11 12:13:30] <%+FlyingPotato82> I know when it's coming out
[2023-01-11 12:13:30] <@%+PigeonWho> i genuinly dont play overwatch for fun
[2023-01-11 12:13:35] <CHICKEN2XD> Most people in elo hell don‚Äôt know they are in elo hell, most people who think they are in elo hell are just hard stuck cuz bad
[2023-01-11 12:13:46] <%+FlyingPotato82> @EffortDB yes
[2023-01-11 12:13:48] <%Thevrex> omg leak
[2023-01-11 12:13:49] <+xjashy> imo ow2 ranked system is way more forgiving than ow1 so if your hardstuck you gotta think about it long and hard
[2023-01-11 12:13:51] <@%+EffortDB> i think most gamers could do with a good ass kicking ngl
[2023-01-11 12:13:57] <@%+PigeonWho> i play overwatch to rank up and thats it
[2023-01-11 12:14:00] <Ship_Lumity> Im hoping it's early this year when it comes out
[2023-01-11 12:14:04] VIEWERS: 88
[2023-01-11 12:14:06] <@%+PigeonWho> granted, i havent played much recently
[2023-01-11 12:14:10] <+vrawnika> true
[2023-01-11 12:14:12] <CHICKEN2XD> I agree
[2023-01-11 12:14:13] <%+FlyingPotato82> @EffortDB 2yrs of military service
[2023-01-11 12:14:20] <Ship_Lumity> IDK why theyre keeping news hidden about the PvE
[2023-01-11 12:14:31] <CHICKEN2XD> Like dude, nobody keeps bringing up how much better they are than you at a game
[2023-01-11 12:14:41] <%katmosk> @Ship_Lumity they want it to be a suprise x3
[2023-01-11 12:14:44] <@%+EffortDB> thats why finnish people are based, mandatory military service
[2023-01-11 12:14:48] <+vrawnika> plus a lot of people do better w positive reinforcement
[2023-01-11 12:15:01] <@%+PigeonWho> no way, if people bully their friends over a game theyre not a person that deserved to have friends. Its one thing to flame randos, but friends??? cmon bro touch some grass
[2023-01-11 12:15:21] <CHICKEN2XD> Military teaches them discipline very well
[2023-01-11 12:15:30] <+Samurai_Bat> @EffortDB I think most people in general need a swift kick in the pants
[2023-01-11 12:15:36] <Ship_Lumity> @PigeonWho That's literally what happens all the time on console where I came from
[2023-01-11 12:15:36] <%McCream38> ur so based and handsome and cool GOF

[2023-01-11 12:17:19] <%+FlyingPotato82> personally when someone tells me to kms that motivates me to play with the skill of a player in 3 divisions above me
[2023-01-11 12:17:20] <CHICKEN2XD> @katmosk no but if you are like blind in the eyes or not up to the par with your comrades you can‚Äôt (ps I am not korean or Finnish I think u misunderstood me)
[2023-01-11 12:17:37] <goyanmtp> I have to to put paper in front of me "don't care, don't flame' to avoid my bad reactions :)
[2023-01-11 12:17:40] <jarvitar> we had a whole thing going on that game in our vc
[2023-01-11 12:17:43] <%+FlyingPotato82> do you think it's ever okay to flame?

[2023-01-11 12:23:04] <%katmosk> svb should put all his videos on unlisted and link it to true fans

[2023-01-11 12:23:21] <Ship_Lumity> TBH @paulinababey I have never come across a console player who doesnt say a slur? They will literally just say slurs off cooldown. See this is what happens when you let a game like overwatch raise your shildren especially to console players

[2023-01-11 14:50:41] <Xelorz_> In NA universities, they often hire professors based off their achievements or for the research topics, their ability to teach is barely considered. So as a result alot of them suck at teaching.
