[2022-12-18 22:55:19] <%+Dritlukt> they have 2
[2022-12-18 22:55:24] <%+enmiti> In the past, a group blows through the first 7, then loses on the the last boss. It's all about the last boss progress. The first team there does have the most time to prog on it though, so that's a leg up
[2022-12-18 22:56:46] <%+Wayupdone> This Raid will be a shitshow in LFR KEKW
[2022-12-18 22:57:31] <flawlesslykun> @Wayupdone only way wow will ever be good for someone that is not in a guild, is if they allow ppl to raid with ai

[2022-12-18 23:00:28] <trickzterrr> where can i buy that buff ? @Wayupdone
[2022-12-18 23:01:03] <flawlesslykun> and ofc this is the extreme example, but even in a top guild like method, there are still people that need 7 hours of doing the same boss and still manage to die/fail for whatever reason. My argument is, sure group content can be enjoyable and rewarding in it's on way, but it should not be the only way to progress on this game
