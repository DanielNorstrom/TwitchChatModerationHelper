[2023-01-05 16:59:42] <@%^Fossabot>* Summary: Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <Moomintroll33> Icebox: the elevated plant spots?
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <%+MrNevNev> B Long is the gimic
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <Opaque_777> b main is the gimmick
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <wasif_17> art gimmick?
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <+InstantYakisoba> pearl doesnt have one
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <arminahmadi1107> @prithviranumb who even asked u anything
[2023-01-05 17:43:42] <aeaantoun> Sewer where the skill is thats split
[2023-01-05 17:43:44] <kr4ken__> another big bad map incoming PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 17:43:44] <TejoTTT> split gimmick is the mid split
[2023-01-05 17:43:46] <issasb> split is ropes, pearl is the mid
[2023-01-05 17:43:47] <%+BuxtonRedding> my little holes are my gimmick.
[2023-01-05 17:43:47] <mozart69_420> @Hiko pearl has connector no other map has connector
[2023-01-05 17:43:48] <KAI0Kenny> it was in a dev video they said there wasnt one
[2023-01-05 17:43:51] <%VillageMascot> The little crawl space on pearl
[2023-01-05 17:43:53] <%+bleavy> Pearls mid for sure the gimmick, its a whole ass maze
[2023-01-05 17:44:00] <slothy_420> They had a hole in mid on pearl but decided against it last minute
[2023-01-05 17:44:00] <catluna19> do a side minimap
[2023-01-05 17:44:01] <+InstantYakisoba> they made pearl specifically to be a normal map
[2023-01-05 17:44:02] <%+BStrong43> @Bvick1381 but the usage of the ropes are very different
[2023-01-05 17:44:03] <%+raz_xx> Is the new map leaked yet?
[2023-01-05 17:44:05] <%d_smyth_> Split was the first map with ropes, icebox first map with horizontal ropes
[2023-01-05 17:44:14] <+H4l3x> all pros like haven
[2023-01-05 17:44:15] <dudepooldude> i think split's gimmick was the ropes  but then that got added to other maps so that's why it was taken out and now will come out with changes mayhaps new gimmick?
[2023-01-05 17:44:16] <probablygel> haven feels small but its big
[2023-01-05 17:44:17] <%VillageMascot> Haven is one of my favorites
[2023-01-05 17:44:17] <r3am3> Do u have the new map early access?
[2023-01-05 17:44:24] <+SugCity> I think haven is good
[2023-01-05 17:44:25] <+AdamLucid> Haven is top 3 map for sure
[2023-01-05 17:44:27] <wasif_17> true.. split had 2 split mids
[2023-01-05 17:44:27] <krak3> Breeze tho
[2023-01-05 17:44:30] <%+bleavy> Iceboz, haven, ascent top 3 idk what order
[2023-01-05 17:44:30] <%+burniebow> i like smaller maps
[2023-01-05 17:44:31] <+InstantYakisoba> iceboxes gimmic is the verticality
[2023-01-05 17:44:32] <saki_au> haven is a good big map not a lot of big maps can be as good as haven @Hiko
[2023-01-05 17:44:33] <FearThisEvil> very attack sided. it has 3 sites.
[2023-01-05 17:44:33] <%leviwackerman> Haven is fun but it's just retake simulator
[2023-01-05 17:44:34] <%+Chew58> i love Haven
[2023-01-05 17:44:36] <+yourgirlmax123> haven is dog while breeze is good
[2023-01-05 17:44:39] <%$xJFrosty> haven is my favorite map. happy to hear it might be 3 bomb sites

[2023-01-05 17:44:48] <%+BuxtonRedding> Haven is my favorite map. But I'm a Brimstone main.
[2023-01-05 17:44:49] <!%+JayceeFX> i love haven
[2023-01-05 17:44:49] <+MuzzieTV> i think pearl is different with how mid is set up
[2023-01-05 17:44:51] <Adlor_> trueeeeeee
[2023-01-05 17:44:51] <1eye_jimmy> agreed
[2023-01-05 17:44:52] <aquageddon> I like haven
[2023-01-05 17:44:53] <%+JN3rve> I love Haven. I use to hate it but got use to it and it‚Äôs fun
[2023-01-05 17:44:54] <+SugCity> I hate bind and breeze tbh
[2023-01-05 17:44:55] <+H4l3x> i hate all the maps lmao
[2023-01-05 17:44:55] <Karate_moses> bind is horrible and breeze, people crying about them going away on twitter are wild
[2023-01-05 17:44:56] <clax5431> @hiko play jett op combo this game
[2023-01-05 17:44:58] <%+bleavy> I like playing bind but thats unpopular
[2023-01-05 17:44:58] <+killertaco2012> 3 sites isnt that bad, i just get bad randos that dont know how to play it.
[2023-01-05 17:44:59] <issasb> icebox getting a bit stale too
[2023-01-05 17:44:59] <saki_au> bind would've been good if there were any mids
[2023-01-05 17:45:00] <FearThisEvil> pro haven = great - ranked haven = cheeks
[2023-01-05 17:45:00] <%+Chew58> Agreed, pro Haven is elite
[2023-01-05 17:45:00] <MonsterHeartFPS> i hate heaven people dont know how to play it @Hiko
[2023-01-05 17:45:01] <+AdamLucid> no map should force an agent like Breeze does Viper
[2023-01-05 17:45:03] <wasif_17> heaven and fracture is so fun to watch
[2023-01-05 17:45:03] <bamoore1996> i just hate how haven players on attack just refuse to play numbers when attackers should always have number adv
[2023-01-05 17:45:03] <mozart69_420> breeze has the best mid in valorant
[2023-01-05 17:45:07] <chikara_dayo> haven forces and imposes active Intel gathering and map control which i really like
[2023-01-05 17:45:15] <%+JN3rve> I‚Äôm so happy split is coming back
[2023-01-05 17:45:15] <yummyely> @mozart69_420 you mean worst
[2023-01-05 17:45:20] <+miklmusic> PRX made split really fun to watch
[2023-01-05 17:45:21] <%QueenofThiev3s> Bind is sooo boring to watch
[2023-01-05 17:45:23] <!%+JayceeFX> i hate bind
[2023-01-05 17:45:27] [Notification] Imax24301 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! [Brimstone, smash or pass?]
[2023-01-05 17:45:30] <%calypsonite> is split coming back as the reworked version or just the same as old?
[2023-01-05 17:45:30] <kr4ken__> bind and split need a complete rework
[2023-01-05 17:45:33] <dudepooldude> yeah its also super hard to attack on bind
[2023-01-05 17:45:40] <%+JustVoss> A vertical map could work if none of the floors overlap the floor below
[2023-01-05 17:45:40] <s1uer> !mouse
[2023-01-05 17:45:41] <aquageddon> Hate bind chokes breeze is the same thing over and over with op and split was choke heavy with mid precense
[2023-01-05 17:45:41] <%+JN3rve> Ascent is my favorite map
[2023-01-05 17:45:42] <bamoore1996> @calypsonite should be reworked
[2023-01-05 17:45:43] <+tambirterazi> tambirMucuk
[2023-01-05 17:45:43] <wasif_17> bye bye bind

[2023-01-05 17:45:53] <%VillageMascot> Bind is my least favorite
[2023-01-05 17:45:55] <Karate_moses> breeze mid cant make up for the awful sites
[2023-01-05 17:45:58] <chikara_dayo> true

[2023-01-05 17:46:03] <yourboygoldphantom> what could fix bind tho? like I feel like its too far gone to change the map

[2023-01-05 17:46:05] <hardertodie> SMASH

[2023-01-05 17:46:14] <+Ryvjinn> breeze games are fun to me
[2023-01-05 17:46:16] <+SugCity> maybe new map will have tp from c to a to make rotations faster 5Head

[2023-01-05 17:46:22] <catluna19> why stretched all of a sudden?
[2023-01-05 17:46:22] <tataparcs> bind, best for raze and breach combo
[2023-01-05 17:46:23] <%PapaPurple69> pass respectfully

[2023-01-05 17:47:14] <Silencio_0> bind imo is the worst map
[2023-01-05 17:47:15] <yummyely> breeze mid and b site are probably the worst designed areas in all valo maps
