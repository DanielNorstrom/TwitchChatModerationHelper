[2023-01-05 20:59:32] <@^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2023-01-05 22:08:10] <@^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain
[2023-01-05 22:08:12] <Sir_Khris> is Rem just a figment of my imagination?

[2023-01-05 22:13:30] <Tharrick> meat donut might be something like that
[2023-01-05 22:13:38] <%the_gaming_brain> Wouldn't meat donuts just be a dumpling or a sausage depending on the pressence of pastry.
[2023-01-05 22:13:45] <rumerris> @Robot_404 it's a bit pinkish, so it's prob raspberry jam
[2023-01-05 22:13:51] <sera_phiel> the meat donut is a reference to an old server event i believe
[2023-01-05 22:13:52] <JimmyTheSmith> Wow, just judging every person

[2023-01-05 22:20:13] <^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2023-01-05 23:02:11] <Bandit_Ein> Gold Means You're calling out a lie, Blue means you agree with the statement
[2023-01-05 23:02:11] <im_iLL> why are they so focused on the gun?

[2023-01-05 23:02:41] <Tharrick> yeah they probably should have explained that
[2023-01-05 23:02:49] <JimmyTheSmith> LUL That's a slightly important thing to miss
[2023-01-05 23:02:49] <+t7soccer> You shoot the blue ones prove them right with the truth bullet you had. I don't think they explainned that xD

[2023-01-05 23:29:55] <brandonmani456> It's a non-fictional murder case.
[2023-01-05 23:29:56] <%PenguinOrca> It was Battle Royal
[2023-01-05 23:29:56] <%+Lonewolf1043> This was a planned murder
[2023-01-05 23:30:00] <mopsentmt> This is the definition of premeditated.

[2023-01-05 23:30:12] <misermark> I suspect the murderer was nervous because his prey was packing heat
[2023-01-05 23:30:12] <%snek981> I mean, if I had a knife and a gun carrying person is chasing me, i'd try to setup a trap too trickyyDerpy
