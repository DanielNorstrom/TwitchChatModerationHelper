[2023-01-06 17:13:29] <+eradycated> @SparkzzMP good point i suppose, haha i think you made up my mind for me. I guess the way i see it was if i could sell my 3080 for anything near 800 which they are still going for used on ebay, i can buy the 4070TI for around the same price for a small upgrade
[2023-01-06 17:13:49] <+SparkzzMP> @eradycated onf FB marketplace they sell for like 600
[2023-01-06 17:14:08] <+TheLunarTek> @sykoscicle people are just annoying. Asking for the same crap for all these keys.
[2023-01-06 17:14:10] <+eradycated> @SparkzzMP I see that but theres tons that are selling recently on ebay for around 800

[2023-01-06 17:23:47] <%+LordDonnie1> that was delayed lol
[2023-01-06 17:23:47] <%SykoScicle> my CPU seems fine when I play tarkov, its my GPU that bottlenecks my framesl.....based on the performance reports.
[2023-01-06 17:23:48] <chops_games> @SykoScicle yeah im waiting on the new x3D cpu and hoping they come out with the 4090ti to get it all at the same time
[2023-01-06 17:23:49] <bogvandi1> i have a gtx 1660 and a intel 9400f and i get only 40-50 fps any advice chat everything is on low
[2023-01-06 17:23:52] <+Hood530> @SykoScicle if youre really looking to upgrade then just decide how much you want to spend. 3090's are being sold for cheap lately
[2023-01-06 17:24:00] <%ThatGuyEnGi> Its bad man, stutters that freeze my game for like 4-5 seconds. Unplayable

[2023-01-06 17:57:03] <!%+MadDogHux> Viewers is not why he went back. He went back because even when he plays other games he is thinking about Tarkov.

[2023-01-06 17:59:13] <+Yamamoto78> the good thing about shoreline key farming vs dorms is that u arent farming them at resort
[2023-01-06 17:59:16] <!%+MadDogHux> I thought Interchange was the key map for some reason.

[2023-01-06 18:58:00] <%+ZomBeastMode> @CptStokers 20 hours or less a week...still can hit 40 if you know the game well and play the whole wipe. Hitting 30 is actually pretty easy
[2023-01-06 18:58:13] <MartinMXR> yerboy2Smooth
[2023-01-06 18:58:15] <+aTriHardsLife> @CptStokers "casual" gaming has become pretty subjective, but id describe it as 1 hour or less per day
[2023-01-06 18:58:35] <+blacktuna> Hitting lvl 30 is possible in a week just playing every evening and running quests.
[2023-01-06 18:58:39] <%$BigBfromSD> I guess define what casual means... for me, I feel like I'm casual in this game. Usually play 2-4 nights a week and 3-5 hours each night. I'm not grinding cause I don't have the time, but feel like I can compete when I play with the gear I end up with and usually end each wipe somewhere in the 40s
[2023-01-06 18:58:49] <%Da_Dush> @CptStokers then no, it's not casual, one raid can take a minimum of 25-30mins
[2023-01-06 18:58:51] <%xgon9> id describe casual gaming 2-3 hours a day
[2023-01-06 18:59:02] <%+ZomBeastMode> @CptStokers 1 hour of gaming a day sounds more like prison than casual
[2023-01-06 18:59:12] <TXKingg> oh shit you running teams bro?

[2023-01-06 19:05:36] <%+Serebus> @Da_Dush I think having a chill session and being a casual gamer are different, if you spend the majority of your spare time playing games then I think you're a hardcore gamer. I also think that you can be "chill" and hardcore at the same time

[2023-01-06 22:12:11] <%Da_Dush> @kurrizmahh ahahah you link your Twitch to your Tark and after watching a certain amount of hours on stream you can "claim" your drop in Twitch then throwing it to your Tarkov stash
[2023-01-06 22:12:15] <+Hood530> @Rourzyy mine sucked. 90% were bolts and nuts
[2023-01-06 22:12:42] <kurrizmahh> Oh so where do i find these drops to claim them?
