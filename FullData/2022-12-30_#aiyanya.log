[2022-12-30 11:54:25] <MoistHeinous> you build a ship and manage it
[2022-12-30 11:54:29] <Raikyr_> Its a nice roguelite
[2022-12-30 11:54:39] <@%Dark_Fable> so ftl is a top down space game. You manage a crew and jump between points on a map
[2022-12-30 11:54:45] <@%Dark_Fable> And each point has a random event
[2022-12-30 11:55:08] <@%Dark_Fable> So sometimes you get into a fight and have to manage shields and weapons
[2022-12-30 11:55:52] <@%Dark_Fable> Other times you solve a problem, and this can be affected by having a certain race of alien in your crew
[2022-12-30 11:56:00] <!%+Edrem> I like drone builds for my ship, those are fun
[2022-12-30 11:56:05] <@%Dark_Fable> Like having the robot people lets you hack things

[2022-12-30 12:37:35] <!%dyseal> The outfits and art in game were fine
[2022-12-30 12:37:40] <%+LinkFi> they adjusted all those old armor sets to be "less sexy"
[2022-12-30 12:37:45] <@%MiyaMewrilee> I think it's the target market. WoW is more western so seeing tits like that is like "WOOOOOAH"
[2022-12-30 12:37:46] <!%+Edrem> it was a problem for blizzard way back when only female gear was skimpy, and no glam system so people didn't really have a choice for some stuff
[2022-12-30 12:37:49] <%+LinkFi> and also why in OW they nerfed teh booties
[2022-12-30 12:37:53] <@%MiyaMewrilee> Where as in asian places it's just normal
[2022-12-30 12:37:53] <!%dyseal> they just overstepped in trying to make a show of being NOT predators
[2022-12-30 12:38:24] <!%dyseal> @MiyaMewrilee Nahh i think its more that Blizzard tried to make a big show about being more female friendly to counter their image
[2022-12-30 12:38:30] <!%dyseal> nah noone really cared

[2022-12-30 12:39:45] <!%Ennendra> Blizzard would care KEKW
[2022-12-30 12:39:47] <!%dyseal> cause China is like 50% of their market
[2022-12-30 12:39:47] <MoistHeinous> china is a large slice of the money pie
[2022-12-30 12:39:51] <@%Dark_Fable> No no give the guys the literal lingerie .
[2022-12-30 12:39:56] <+Onmyoujin> I mean, the problem is, most companies producing stuff for international markets (including Aus, NZ, and US) care a lot about what China is doing.

[2022-12-30 12:54:25] <!%+Edrem> oh on the topic of that movie, it has a very good dub, done by the actors themselves, but the subtitles don't match. so was thinking having subtitles off except for the songs that are still in telugu
[2022-12-30 12:54:31] <the_voidhunter> Everything would have been a lot smoother had Tanaka not picked crystal tools as ff14's engine.

[2022-12-30 12:55:22] <@%Dark_Fable> I went googling for Archage 2 and it seems like one of the two developers are actually Black Desert Onlines original developers before they sold it to Pearl Abyss
[2022-12-30 12:55:31] <!%+Edrem> there is a lot of improvements in DX12, but then you still have to support pc players on DX11, and shader compilation stutter sucks
