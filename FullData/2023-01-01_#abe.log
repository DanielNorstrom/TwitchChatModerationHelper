[2023-01-01 00:00:00] <bigReverbX> most of the time a treasure set is so low armor you don't lose much if you die
[2023-01-01 00:00:01] <mumin_mayhem> so he technically swapped in the vault
[2023-01-01 00:00:02] VIEWERS: 669
[2023-01-01 00:00:16] <+dragster6711> ment to swap it out as it still had repairs
[2023-01-01 00:00:52] <+dragster6711> well its not changed yet so still use it ?
[2023-01-01 00:01:03] <%$Tawnnie> We never abuse
[2023-01-01 00:01:04] <Crebbas> RIP, captian used a 20% loot False doll in his 4xplentiful mine room. then you had a 60% loot one from her,
[2023-01-01 00:01:05] <tsukkana> i liked the idea someone said in his stream a while ago of effectively applying something like a curse of binding to players when they enter the vault - that way you can't switch gear mid-vault, but if your vault gear breaks in-vault you can still put new gear on
[2023-01-01 00:01:06] <Garnthal> putting on replacement gear because one piece breaks is drastically different than just swapping for looting advantages, because you don't get the broken piece back
[2023-01-01 00:01:38] <%LaLaBriar> its still free loot
[2023-01-01 00:01:45] <+dragster6711> its better then nothing XD
[2023-01-01 00:02:02] <%lucasingame> gonna be hard to implement but maybe put a timer on how often you can equip/swap gear
[2023-01-01 00:02:02] VIEWERS: 688
[2023-01-01 00:02:08] <Garnthal> That is true it is you're own fault if your gear breaks
[2023-01-01 00:02:12] <%imertsanchez> Im heading off
[2023-01-01 00:02:21] <%imertsanchez> Happy new year to eu

[2023-01-01 00:02:49] <%$Tawnnie> Is wake up
[2023-01-01 00:02:49] <+Volratho> I think the inability to swap idols and shields would invalidate most idols

[2023-01-01 00:03:06] <%Rannu_Y> its 2023 for me and not planning on sleeping any time soon

[2023-01-01 00:03:57] <%+bigtowza> if they lock idol and sheild how do you pick people up if they die
[2023-01-01 00:04:01] <+dragster6711> But then your just guessing what idol
[2023-01-01 00:04:02] VIEWERS: 688

[2023-01-01 01:48:35] <cappa654321> I mean my way is awful i jump run around killing mobs and hope for best
[2023-01-01 01:49:20] <cappa654321> Omg this music is a mad vibe i need to listen to all this mans songs
[2023-01-01 01:49:47] <f0laaaaa> i think the combo of pickerang and killing the spiders is prob the most efficient
[2023-01-01 01:49:54] <%+Honeth> 2x2 can have entity cramming due to amount of mobs
[2023-01-01 01:49:55] <lucieluc137> i saw someone use a infinite water bucket and just flood the whole room
[2023-01-01 01:49:59] <%+Honeth> meaning new mobs can spawn
[2023-01-01 01:50:06] <%+raspberrykelly> times a ticking
[2023-01-01 01:50:24] <+dragster6711> @Honeth yeha its what happend it the vault abe ran earlier
[2023-01-01 01:50:28] VIEWERS: 557
[2023-01-01 01:50:49] <f0laaaaa> yeah he's still on track
[2023-01-01 01:51:03] <%+Honeth> honestly locating the spawners and clearing a 5x5x3 around them would solve any mobs spawning but might be overkill
[2023-01-01 01:51:16] <cappa654321> I made infinite water bucket i placed it and it wasnt infinite and i was sad coz i wasted a pog
[2023-01-01 01:51:18] <+dragster6711> @Honeth only 1 spawner in the center
[2023-01-01 01:51:39] <+dragster6711> but it has custom spawn range
[2023-01-01 01:51:45] <urie_kiriyama> @dragster6711 forgot to reply but that's interesting. even with like 4x plentiful that sparklez did, it seemed good enough. but we haven't seen any recent normal ones so it might be the case
[2023-01-01 01:51:48] <%+Honeth> gotcha they customized the spawner for the room
[2023-01-01 01:52:07] <f0laaaaa> yeah bc you've def had mobs spawn on you in the corners
[2023-01-01 01:52:10] <czerwonaiskra> He cleared one or two rooms?
[2023-01-01 01:52:14] <czerwonaiskra> Oh

[2023-01-01 01:53:59] <LaboePlay> pickarang is good to kill spiders so not kill other mobs

[2023-01-01 01:55:28] <%DrTasslehoff> his reach magnet is +10? I think he went for exclusively range upgrades, and hit L7

[2023-01-01 02:33:17] <+dragster6711> @WilliCookie but its ment to give you the ore version not just 1 gem
[2023-01-01 02:33:34] <%+xModded> H has an easy villager for silk touch
[2023-01-01 02:33:34] <+dragster6711> @WilliCookie casue you could then fortune the ore and get more
[2023-01-01 02:33:48] <LaboePlay> mending pick will heal from ores cause they drop exp even when u se silk
[2023-01-01 02:33:56] <%WilliCookie> Yeah ik I’m just saying for the time being while it’s bugged for silk touch he can disenchant and use fortune instead
[2023-01-01 02:34:28] <+dragster6711> @WilliCookie but it would only give him 1 per instance of ore broken

[2023-01-01 04:28:53] <mrdangertheking> what do use it on
[2023-01-01 04:29:18] <%morpheus7078> if they touch other drawers, they will be connected to your system
[2023-01-01 04:29:57] <exot_> need the other key to lock it
[2023-01-01 04:30:13] <+seadeaffan> it'll stay in
[2023-01-01 04:30:14] <mrskizzrm> No
[2023-01-01 04:30:15] <DeaLatalis> no
[2023-01-01 04:30:17] <+allys1004> nope it stays
[2023-01-01 04:30:20] <LaboePlay> no
[2023-01-01 04:30:22] <mrdangertheking> no
[2023-01-01 04:30:30] <mrskizzrm> so when it hits 0 the item remains
[2023-01-01 04:30:36] <%WilliCookie> If you have 0 basically
[2023-01-01 04:30:40] <LaboePlay> if it get empty it remember what was in it
[2023-01-01 04:30:45] <+allys1004> do it when you connect to the inventory
[2023-01-01 04:30:48] <kriptou21> so that when you reach 0 it keeps the filter
[2023-01-01 04:30:49] <exot_> if you removed all 4000 the slot is not kept in the drawer without it being locked
