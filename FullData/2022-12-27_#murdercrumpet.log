Я хочу, чтобы ты издевался надо мной, посадил меня в темницу и безжалостно бил меня днями, я бы хотел, чтобы ты бил меня. я хотел бы, чтобы ты душил меня днями напролет, я хочу, чтобы ты приковал меня цепью к стене и бил меня с палкой, ну, я прошу пощады. Я бы хотел, чтобы ты топтал меня ногой. Я бы хотел, чтобы ты пытал меня целыми днями всеми возможными способами.
