[2023-01-03 04:31:06] <MrGoofball> And what's the point of owning a crap ton of guns if you don't shoot large varmints in your yard?  Embrace your Hillbilly roots son!!!! :P

[2023-01-03 06:18:42] <!%GoldSkis> I mean, if you Wana drag a cooler around that will work. but you would need the cooler and the antenna with you the whole time. Now, starlink on your boat? that is the way to go

[2023-01-03 06:56:21] <%oxY_tv> I think so
[2023-01-03 06:56:22] <Bunsan> Yeah Chris Pronger
[2023-01-03 06:56:42] <+DoubleNutz> worst one i saw in hockey was the guy who got his throat slashed from a skate
[2023-01-03 06:56:54] <AC_ThirtySix> pronger was a tough mfer
[2023-01-03 06:56:56] <$Rararawr> I know thats also a think in lacrosse. The chest plate is because a ball can stop your heart
[2023-01-03 06:57:03] <$Rararawr> no that was the sabres goalie
[2023-01-03 06:57:21] <Bunsan> A junior was killed in same way I believe. Might have been butt of stick though.
[2023-01-03 06:57:22] <smilingowl> i know rugby is a bigger sport here in europa and i know they too have a concussion issue, the same in soccer, where heading the ball is ill advised
[2023-01-03 06:57:48] VIEWERS: 304
[2023-01-03 06:58:34] <AC_ThirtySix> yeah heading the ball in soccer can give small concussions pretty frequently which is why its dangerous
[2023-01-03 06:59:48] VIEWERS: 304
[2023-01-03 06:59:48] <AC_ThirtySix> well the reason its dangerous is because most of the time they dont even notice they have a concussion
[2023-01-03 06:59:49] <AlexOfDoom> only true if you talk about the male soccer players
[2023-01-03 06:59:49] <+Itsapaul> I'd find the flopping annoying if the game wasn't already giga boring
[2023-01-03 07:00:13] <$unknownohyeah> theyre finding micro concussions add up and are just as bad as knockout hits
[2023-01-03 07:00:22] <+Itsapaul> That 0-0 US vs UK game unsold me on the whole sport
[2023-01-03 07:00:30] <$Rararawr> it is funny seeing someone go down from a light shin kick. Compared to the jets quarterback who got his ass folded in half twice and returned to the field with broken ribs
[2023-01-03 07:00:44] <$unknownohyeah> hockey is just better soccer imo
[2023-01-03 07:00:52] <AC_ThirtySix> @Itsapaul that world cup final shouldve re-sold you on the sport

[2023-01-03 07:30:43] <%EpicPumaNess> rich nobles back in the day didn't want people to think they were eating the same thing as the commoners so they called it venison instead of deer, beef instead of cow etc.

[2023-01-03 07:32:43] <%ANeerMiss> Venison was a catch all term for any hunted/game meat. But since Deer were hunted more than any other animal, the name just became attributed to them exclusively

[2023-01-03 08:31:11] <%malrockk> Would be nice if they found other forms of ads that didn't totally interrupt live video
[2023-01-03 08:31:25] <%Darklightnin> @malrockk They fucking can, the just don't.
[2023-01-03 08:31:34] <%Darklightnin> Twitch 100% had a mini player that went above the chat
[2023-01-03 08:31:41] <%Darklightnin> but when they used it, they put the stream there instead of the ad.
[2023-01-03 08:31:42] <%$NyalyssatheBaka> mobile has some ads that just occasionally slide in
[2023-01-03 08:31:47] <%Hrukjan> they have ads on mobile for me currently that slide in

[2023-01-03 08:32:21] <%KettleBlack> yeee
[2023-01-03 08:32:22] <%Darklightnin> If you interrupt a stream fully, you're gonna piss people off.
[2023-01-03 08:32:27] <%OakmontOwls> @NyalyssatheBaka I've had pride flags and thousand dollar thing
[2023-01-03 08:32:42] <%Hrukjan> it is usually less intrusive, unless i am in my bed and the amazon ad calls gondor for aid
[2023-01-03 08:32:50] <%+gudrunix> i get adds for local apartments and student housing its kinda spooky

[2023-01-03 08:33:32] <$AngryWayneGretzki> so the Twitch ad issue at current is that ads that dont take over 100% of screen and audio space only pay a fraction of the price. Otherwise it would be more banner ads.
[2023-01-03 08:33:32] <$Unweaver> boy are they missing out
[2023-01-03 08:33:42] <$Rararawr> The thing I hated that drove me to get turbo is pre rolls. Like if I see a thumbnail and just want to pop in and see if I want to watch but theres a 30 second ad, I hate it
[2023-01-03 08:33:48] <%$NyalyssatheBaka> hell I never got ads for Michigan politics... in Michigan!

[2023-01-03 08:34:47] <Nukenade> advertisers just wanna hose people down with their ads as if annoyance isnt a turnoff

[2023-01-03 08:35:18] <%tyrolia_valerian> it's kind of an open secret that spamming your ads everywhere doesn't have that huge an effect, but if you don't blow your whole budget some bright spark says that you won't need that big a budget next cycle. rooSip
