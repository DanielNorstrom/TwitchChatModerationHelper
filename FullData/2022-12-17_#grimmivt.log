[2022-12-17 18:39:16] <!%Prof_PavloVT> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Grimmi. The humor is extremely fujo, and without a solid grasp of theoretical vtubing most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Grimmi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her character. Her personal philosophy draws heavily from BL literature. The fans understand this stuff;

[2022-12-17 19:23:49] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @arcreaper_21 It wasn't just Anthem, Dragon Age 4 was in development at the same time. They kept switching devs between both games so often nobody got anything done on either.

[2022-12-17 19:51:42] <%LeonidasUmbra> a lot of those branching options were independent of each other. Its still hard but its doable
[2022-12-17 19:51:44] <%jinx_the_sphinx_> Yeah you have the A/B/O dialog options, just like in really life grimmi14SmugGrimm
[2022-12-17 19:51:48] <Quilltaz> Grimmi watch out the Batarians exist and that is cringe!
[2022-12-17 19:52:08] <%newtonia09> even in 3, it was obvious that the writers didn't know what to do with some of the material
[2022-12-17 19:52:10] <%$Tempest_52> I went crazy making sure no one died in the suicide mission

[2022-12-17 19:53:25] <!%Prof_PavloVT> I liked in the ifrst game when I got to punch the annoying reporter
[2022-12-17 19:53:34] <!%GinjiVitis> let's punch a reporter and smooch bad guys
[2022-12-17 19:53:35] <Quilltaz> I want the next Mass Effect to have an AI companion voiced by grimmi who only says Dialogue when you talk to them

[2022-12-17 19:53:41] <%the5thedward> @Tempest_52 But then you can go into 3 with practically everyone dead and the game still continues. They accounted for like everything
[2022-12-17 19:53:42] <%newtonia09> Andromeda is just bad though, its not really average, if it was average, it would recieve the reception that dragon age 2 did
[2022-12-17 19:53:58] <@%Extrafuzzy> im gonna buy some groceries since you'll be here

[2022-12-17 19:54:13] <%RomeoEchoDelta> They'd dodge it and punch you before getting knocked the fuck out.

[2022-12-17 19:55:17] <@%Extrafuzzy> Before i go can you explain why they went from infinite ammo in ME 1 to limited ammo in ME 2?
[2022-12-17 19:55:17] <!%Prof_PavloVT> I got mad at the second game for introducing ammo.  I liked not having to worry about ammo in the first game

[2022-12-17 19:55:55] <%faychannel> the one where dexter meet his future versions?
[2022-12-17 19:55:57] <Quilltaz> remember how in universe they "upgraded" their guns by giving them ammunition instead of having infinite ammo that needs to cool down for like 2 seconds, clearly this is the most bestest way to improve our guns
[2022-12-17 19:56:09] <%+nachtigalfinn> My favorite ME moment is if you keep punching the reporter, and she learns self defense just to shit on you in third

[2022-12-17 19:56:21] <%newtonia09> Andromeda is just a bad game, its as bad as dragon age inquisition's gameplay without the small nuggets of narrative genius that was in inquisition

[2022-12-17 20:00:09] <yoshi1hero> You get bonus powers from clearing the diff loyalty missions on new runs
[2022-12-17 20:00:11] <%LeonidasUmbra> engineers get like drones and stuff
[2022-12-17 20:00:11] <%newtonia09> Vanguard Charge is OP

[2022-12-17 20:00:34] <%the5thedward> Biotic was so fun but I almost always went infiltrator
[2022-12-17 20:00:36] <%+nachtigalfinn> You could also have extra dialogue choices based on your classes and powers.

[2022-12-17 20:01:06] <%newtonia09> Vanguard feels like you're a superhero
[2022-12-17 20:01:09] <%Edibleghost> biotic kinda sucked in 1 but shredded in 2 and 3

[2022-12-17 20:01:36] <%38justenrules> But yeah I also recommend wrath of the righteous. Some paths give you entirely different outcomes. Like you can become a lich and recruit some characters you kill as permanent undead party members
[2022-12-17 20:01:59] <%newtonia09> And the characters in Wotr are all amazing
[2022-12-17 20:02:05] <%the5thedward> I think mass effect 3 did biotic best sadly

[2022-12-17 20:02:24] <%38justenrules> aru it wotr is adorable!
[2022-12-17 20:02:24] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I got obsessed with the mechanical side of this game. By the third game you could make grenades that could kill those giant mech suits in one hit.

[2022-12-17 20:03:14] <Quilltaz> Saren had such a banger design

[2022-12-17 20:05:00] <karn_the_king> saren daddy
[2022-12-17 20:05:11] <%Edibleghost> he was the original gaslighter
[2022-12-17 20:05:13] <%BotFodder> He was already a cyborg (and huge even for a Turian) before ME1
[2022-12-17 20:05:24] <+phantomsalmon> I do love that ME had non-violent solution to final fight
[2022-12-17 20:05:26] <Quilltaz> Saren is the gigachad meme of the turians and that is why everyone on the council loves him and trusts him implicicably
[2022-12-17 20:05:39] <%LeonidasUmbra> all Vakarian kinda look the same
[2022-12-17 20:05:40] <%RodrickFerrenday> There's a mod for Legendary Edition that tones that design down for a more Turian-look at the start, then slowly changes it to corrupt him with robotics as the game goes on
[2022-12-17 20:05:43] <%RodrickFerrenday> It's great
[2022-12-17 20:05:44] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @botfodder No it was, boneless glitch, part members just not functioning, certain weapons just being impossible to get and taking up space.
[2022-12-17 20:05:44] <%newtonia09> sorry, I mean, Saren is SigmaChad, accquire influence and power, ignore morality and the council

[2022-12-17 20:06:13] <Quilltaz> My name is Garrus Vakarian and I am all of the turians
[2022-12-17 20:06:19] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Well Garus does look like his dad so he's not wrong.
[2022-12-17 20:06:23] <%newtonia09> He was a trend setter

[2022-12-17 20:07:16] <%Bluu_the_king> So leonidas just gave us an example why Ashley is the worse character in the game
[2022-12-17 20:07:20] <%Edibleghost> the flesh is weak
[2022-12-17 20:07:25] <%LeonidasUmbra> makes sense for specters since they're like super soldiers
[2022-12-17 20:07:47] <%LeonidasUmbra> those specters were weak
[2022-12-17 20:08:06] <%newtonia09> @Bluu_the_king Ashley atleast gets redeemed in ME3 but James is a buffoon all throughout
[2022-12-17 20:08:12] <%jinx_the_sphinx_> Saren is a Karen mikama3Knife
[2022-12-17 20:08:21] <%ORDIAH> rules of nature
[2022-12-17 20:08:22] <%faychannel> so let me get this straight. the ME story is pretty much a collab of you and jones
[2022-12-17 20:08:26] <Quilltaz> Saren be like: I ate all of my internal organs and replaced them with machine parts that suspiciously look like geth gear but trust me, I was just hungry and I am loyal and humans suck
[2022-12-17 20:08:27] <%RomeoEchoDelta> He was cybernetically enhanced already and they had never seen anyone corrupted by the Reapers before. Plus Turians hating humans is pretty par for the course.

[2022-12-17 20:47:00] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Kasumi and Zaeed are the only two that can't die in the ending I think because they don't take part.

[2022-12-17 21:19:18] <!+Jignx> you probably have to install origins
[2022-12-17 21:19:41] <$UltraFist0> dlc in 2 is perhaps the best in the series
[2022-12-17 21:19:45] <%tyson970> just get legendary edition its way more worth it
[2022-12-17 21:19:51] <%ArcReaper_21> Oh yeah! I loved Kasumi in ME2.
[2022-12-17 21:19:51] <$UltraFist0> Captain Kirrache is a solid dude
[2022-12-17 21:20:00] <GamingWhulphe> Legendary edition is best
[2022-12-17 21:20:03] <%newtonia09> legendary edition lens flare is harsh though

[2022-12-17 21:21:44] <!+Jignx> in ME3 there was a DLC party member that you would actually lose ingame content and lore if you didnt buy it
[2022-12-17 21:21:45] <%if_you_seiso> I wish they did more with the dlc characters
[2022-12-17 21:21:58] <%+Lonoxmont> literally cotton hill going I KILLED FIDDY MEN
[2022-12-17 21:22:03] <%ArcReaper_21> What about the Overlord dlc? It connects to ME3 as well.

[2022-12-17 21:22:17] <%RodrickFerrenday> They're so good
[2022-12-17 21:22:18] <$UltraFist0> Zaeed also got that gun story, I loved that gun
[2022-12-17 21:22:19] <N0bbody> @Jignx Javik?
[2022-12-17 21:22:20] <%newtonia09> he's literally cotton hill!
[2022-12-17 21:22:21] <Quilltaz> this is so true
[2022-12-17 21:22:28] <%RodrickFerrenday> Javik was DLC? Huh
[2022-12-17 21:22:36] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Yup

[2022-12-17 21:22:47] <$UltraFist0> Kappa
[2022-12-17 21:22:48] <%the5thedward> So the DLC for 2 does work but you have to take the keys you get from steam and active them on the EA site for them to show up when you login to the cerberus network thing or buy them from EA
[2022-12-17 21:22:50] <%if_you_seiso> Zaeed: so anyway I started blastin

[2022-12-17 22:00:21] <%Bluu_the_king> I guess we just gotta speedrun ME1
[2022-12-17 22:00:25] <%newtonia09> I can't even remember what kaiden did in ME 3
[2022-12-17 22:00:25] <Crater7> THE ONE DRIVE IS REALLLLL
[2022-12-17 22:00:29] <%$Tempest_52> OneDrive is WIndow's cloud service

[2022-12-17 22:00:33] <%GamingWhulphe> I think the one drive is windows
[2022-12-17 22:00:33] <%BotFodder> Kaiden going out like a hero felt like it 'fit' better for me. That scene just doesn't hit the same way if you choose the one you like less.

[2022-12-17 22:00:56] <%ArcReaper_21> You can edit the savegame in ME2.
[2022-12-17 22:00:58] <%Halbernacht> In theory I guess you could make a character and then retroactively edit your choices later.
[2022-12-17 22:00:59] <%+BigBadWulf97> I used a save creator
[2022-12-17 22:01:18] <Atomicsteamengine> Is it possible to edit the ME2 save?
[2022-12-17 22:01:19] <%RomeoEchoDelta> No way to download the motion comics for choices on PC?
[2022-12-17 22:01:20] <!%$Nyanomancer> There's a funny dlc for this game that lets you chose
[2022-12-17 22:01:23] <%+gacman47> I'm sure there's an online generator thing to make an ME1 save
[2022-12-17 22:01:29] <%LeonidasUmbra> @ArcReaper_21 this, make a new ME2 save file and edit that

[2022-12-17 22:01:55] <%ArcReaper_21> I did that because I did not want to replay another 120 hours to create a slightly different char.
[2022-12-17 22:01:57] <%GamingWhulphe> We need the Miranda butt camera angles
[2022-12-17 22:02:02] <$UltraFist0> Almost for sure
[2022-12-17 22:02:05] <%BotFodder> Yes
[2022-12-17 22:02:25] <%BotFodder> You can generate a save with the desired flags, it's easier

[2022-12-17 22:02:58] <%GamingWhulphe> Mordin is usually first though
[2022-12-17 22:03:10] <%Halbernacht> That would have been sweat, but I understand why they dropped it since making the ME games seems like a nightmare.
[2022-12-17 22:03:11] <%+BigBadWulf97> I hope you've done the dlc mission in ME1 where a moon is held hostage
[2022-12-17 22:03:21] <%newtonia09> does legion even have dialogue for earlier scenes?
[2022-12-17 22:03:31] <%+gacman47> I wish I could get all the unique dialogue but you never know who to equip

[2022-12-17 22:03:49] <%GamingWhulphe> If there was a Batarian in the game I always killed them.
[2022-12-17 22:03:59] <%newtonia09> Legion being recruitable earlier would have been AMAZING
[2022-12-17 22:04:04] <$UltraFist0> Can we have a mod for Legion so we can do them without worrying about that one thing happening
[2022-12-17 22:04:22] <%+Lonoxmont> i mean we are here mostly because we enjoy you and your vibes grimmi, the game or activity etc is secondary tbh Kappa
[2022-12-17 22:04:30] <%GamingWhulphe> You can still bring Legion to Tali‚Äôs loyalty mission but risk killing the crew‚Ä¶
[2022-12-17 22:04:39] <%+BigBadWulf97> it's normal for companions to have lines for sections in game where they aren't present. Devs like to get all possible voice work done before settling on things in story
[2022-12-17 22:04:39] <%ArcReaper_21> It's hilarious to bring him into Tali's loyalty mission. Always made me laugh watching him react to Daro Xen.
[2022-12-17 22:04:43] <%BotFodder> I remember bringing Legion into the Citadel, it was awkward LUL
[2022-12-17 22:04:47] <%newtonia09> Legion being recruitable early would eliminate that risk @GamingWhulphe

[2022-12-17 22:28:35] <Quilltaz> if you think about it why would asari conform themselves to other species views of the sexes, since they basically have ascended beyond that stage as a species and it dont matter to them whatsoever?

[2022-12-17 23:29:32] <+ArceusStarDestroyer> One of my fav trilogy
[2022-12-17 23:29:33] <%ArcReaper_21> From back in the comics actually shortly after the First Contact War. Part of the standard Reaper SOP as per Javik.
[2022-12-17 23:29:33] <@%Extrafuzzy> yea, the first playthrough tag is a lie
[2022-12-17 23:29:53] <Pond_water> I mean, he's obviously evil. He's the most obviously evil character. He has glowing eyes and smokes in his chair like a Bond villain.

[2022-12-17 23:31:19] <Oshtur> It was in Steins;Gate
[2022-12-17 23:31:38] <Pond_water> It's root tea, after all.
[2022-12-17 23:31:42] <%ArcReaper_21> If you remember the Mass Effect Foundations comics, you can see Jack Harper (aka the Illusive Man) become indoctrinated. Also hints to Saren's start to fall as well.
[2022-12-17 23:31:52] <Lareolan> Rootbeer tastes like medicine to Europeans. It took a while to get used to drinking it after moving to Canada.
[2022-12-17 23:32:01] <%38justenrules> Supposedly Dr peppers taste is based on the smell of a bunch of medicinal syrups mixing together

[2022-12-17 23:35:34] <%newtonia09> @The_Churro_Man thats true, but he's also a prick to tali which makes no sense if you hate AI
[2022-12-17 23:35:41] <%ArcReaper_21> Well that and the entire effort I put into making peace between Geth and Quarians.
[2022-12-17 23:35:48] <%SigridAndBird> the best way to get souls is to steal them
[2022-12-17 23:35:51] <%38justenrules> I consider a soul basically a personality. So if a robot is an individual with their own feelings I'd say they have a soul
