[2022-12-23 17:43:07] <+JayDeerTay> 22  is better
[2022-12-23 17:43:12] <%+punkgeek> 35 is multirole and ground support before air sup

[2022-12-23 19:18:15] <%+LiveType> @kenshin2666 Take it from me. Get that commute time down to under 30 mins. You'll thank yourself in the future. Keep looking until you find it. The stress isn't worth the pay increase unless it's absurd.

[2022-12-23 19:19:24] <+kenshin2666> @LiveType for that kind of commute, i would have to be paid for my time, and very well at that, because that makes the day like 12-13hrs long and ill just be exhausted and drained. Ive done crazy hours in the army, i am not doing it for a reg job

[2022-12-23 20:06:55] <akaCube> protons change the element
[2022-12-23 20:06:59] <Trollsamaa> Heavy water is extra proton H2O yes. hence the "heavy" because its mass is double normal Hydrogen (D2O)
[2022-12-23 20:07:00] <+lintensteel21> its 2h because it has an extra neutron instead of just a proton you can also have tritium or 3h
[2022-12-23 20:07:03] <The_Holas> hydrogen is just one proton ... deuterium is proton + neutron

[2022-12-23 20:50:41] <@%ninopanda> I thought about doing a gamba if you actually complete this pack by Jan 1st
[2022-12-23 20:51:05] <MaxNeedsSnacks> you go from smelting 1 item every second to **32 items** in like 8 ticks even with the basic one iirc
[2022-12-23 20:51:06] <@%Larklen> @ninopanda I would have if we could've done a multi-day open gamba KEKW

[2022-12-23 20:53:47] <MaxNeedsSnacks> i made massive HV arrays and kept them all the way up until IV
[2022-12-23 20:53:54] <MaxNeedsSnacks> because i found *most* recipes are unlocked around HV already
[2022-12-23 20:54:12] <MaxNeedsSnacks> tho parallelising alloy smelters is... hell

[2022-12-23 20:54:54] <+Kinteshi> i would say pattern and everything to them should always be automated first ?

[2022-12-23 20:55:05] <MaxNeedsSnacks> @Grumpage rubber is *always* an issue until you get silicone rubber or styrene butadiene i feel
[2022-12-23 20:55:07] <Noblez_> If you're going to make a floor for every new voltage, you'll have to go down a lot by the end of this modpack

[2022-12-23 21:34:54] <officialhunterx> i do the same thing
[2022-12-23 21:35:01] <$Romil01> i thrive on 4-6 hours of sleep. no more than that.
[2022-12-23 21:35:06] <officialhunterx> smelt it
[2022-12-23 21:35:10] <officialhunterx> then macerate it
[2022-12-23 21:35:11] <heroindark> you dont have deep sleep, because you lack heart. i have same problems.

[2022-12-23 21:35:13] <Kerold> Sounds stress related
[2022-12-23 21:35:18] <+kingkhal_drogo> The sleep average of like 6-8 hours is just that - an average. Some people require more and others require less.
[2022-12-23 21:35:18] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-23 21:35:20] <+neveryotherday> if I don't get 8h of sleep I am a complete potato for the day
[2022-12-23 21:35:27] <+Furiak> probably sleep apnea ?
[2022-12-23 21:35:30] <$Romil01> @theszechuanslinger i love it
[2022-12-23 21:35:38] <PureSpider> could be sleep apnea actually
[2022-12-23 21:35:43] <Keydose> yeah apnoea is a breathing thing
[2022-12-23 21:35:45] <%0omkins> Yes apnea relates to breathing.
[2022-12-23 21:35:46] <lurking_2> would you even know
[2022-12-23 21:35:46] <%+P00nDozer69> it's stopping breathing yeah
[2022-12-23 21:35:50] <%TelRehiad> if you have apnea you would probably snore a lot
[2022-12-23 21:35:56] <+Furiak> I mean yeah it's breathing, but I don't hink you notice it until you can't sleep....
[2022-12-23 21:36:06] <Atzgee> insomnia  also difficult to stay asleep
[2022-12-23 21:36:06] <+TheGeekPeek> restless leg syndrome, apneas, light sleepers, and some day night cycle syndromes could cause that
[2022-12-23 21:36:10] <+TheGeekPeek> I have sleep issues aswell
[2022-12-23 21:36:17] <$Romil01> pretty sure i'm apneatic, if thats a word. if not, i just created it. bam.
[2022-12-23 21:36:21] <@%ninopanda> if i get more than 4 hours and less than 6 hours.  I wake up the next day with no issues.
[2022-12-23 21:36:23] <+kingkhal_drogo> He would notice if he has a tracker/watch that tracks his O2 and heart rate.
[2022-12-23 21:36:25] <+TheKayo> I have multiple friends with sleep apnea that never knew why their sleep was crap till they did a sleep study, now with cpap they sleep better than me
[2022-12-23 21:36:29] <+Face_32> snoring doesnt have to wake you up to be detrimental
[2022-12-23 21:36:32] <adamh29> 4 hours sleep all a get
[2022-12-23 21:36:37] <%+FireForEffekt> could be anything. wrong mattress, koffein, bad breathing.....there are some blankets that are really heavy to hold you down, some find that really relaxing and makes them drowsy
[2022-12-23 21:36:37] <Balafore> 5-6hrs is my norm
[2022-12-23 21:36:47] <Balafore> it's not healthy but is what it is
[2022-12-23 21:36:49] <%TelRehiad> when I got diagnosed with apnea.. that first night after getting my machine.. was the best night of sleep ever.

[2022-12-23 22:42:22] <hippiedude212> also you need the extractor speed upgrade in the connection under the farming station

[2022-12-23 22:43:05] <Tapeman83> you have to try them in machines one by one to figure out which ones are the best
