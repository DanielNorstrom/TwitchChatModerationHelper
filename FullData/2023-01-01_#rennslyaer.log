[2023-01-01 10:15:59] <%+EldritchChaos> I think it works similar to passing your hand through a flame, when you do it fast enough it doesn't have time to trigger the pain receptors
[2023-01-01 10:16:01] <%+rikunort> it's a very good edit renndogBongo
[2023-01-01 10:16:02] <%iconic_toblerone> this is impressive because of the reaction time needed for this
[2023-01-01 10:16:14] <%nily_is_nily> ok then
[2023-01-01 10:16:14] <!%$DatingDaysDruid> Basically:  the reason the man's hand doesn't melt off is because the interaction between the hot metal and his hand causes water to rapidly evaporate from the surface of his skin, creating a powerful but transient cloud of water vapor that protects it.
