[2022-12-19 11:30:57] <+AGirlCalledJim> it's fine for 1080 but needs to be higher for 1440]
[2022-12-19 11:31:18] <XHXHXH_OW> I think for 1080p 60 fps the bitrate needs to be 6000
[2022-12-19 11:31:30] <XHXHXH_OW> And for 1440 it needs to be 8000
[2022-12-19 11:31:54] <%MapleRoar> Don't people say to stream in like 960p or something to make it look nicer

[2022-12-19 12:32:43] <%+isnt_henry> also 50% more dmg to the whole team, but what do i know
[2022-12-19 12:32:44] <JuraForest> I blame henry. He is not killed 5 with coom
[2022-12-19 12:32:46] <3Lyra> why she even need a fucking call to talk there lmao

[2022-12-19 12:33:04] <@%aidreu> I feel like ignoring shotcall can fuck the team
[2022-12-19 12:33:10] <%+isnt_henry> oh yeah, i wiffed like 3 shots on the orisa
[2022-12-19 12:33:12] <spaxnooo> sojourn didnt kill anything because she just got orisa ulted and didnt get healed lol

[2022-12-19 12:34:10] <tirdni> I feel like they need to give rein like 50% ult charge if you get stunned out of it. Since you cant stun hog out of ult, cant stun doom and orisa and dva too
[2022-12-19 12:34:27] <%it_is_owen> that is quite unfortunate mr streamer but you must shrug it off and move forward lhcloudyYEP

[2022-12-19 12:41:24] <spaxnooo> @terrestrialbug ults are versatile and can be used in many situations so if you as a tank dont decide which ults to engage with theres a chance that you overult
[2022-12-19 12:41:38] <spaxnooo> like what the enemy team did committing 4 ults to a fight that was already won
[2022-12-19 12:42:15] <%streetbaaCk> haha, you are duoing with Henry üòÜ
[2022-12-19 12:42:15] <%Apuphis> i do got a question, when im using rein and the other tank is not doing much their dps switch to mei and bastion what do i do?

[2022-12-19 12:48:31] <endcosmos> if i go for backline she just spinny spears me away

[2022-12-19 12:49:52] <tirdni> jesse is cooking

[2022-12-19 12:50:15] <tirdni> @spaxnooo i dont think you can
[2022-12-19 12:50:26] <%Kripp_mod_me_pls> wheres the cam btw
[2022-12-19 12:50:34] <surelyURjokingMrFeynman> it's like the only damage block you can't pin
[2022-12-19 12:50:36] <spaxnooo> i have definitely charged many many many orisas out of javelin spin
[2022-12-19 12:51:07] <OneManArmystar> I charge straight to an orisa and she is able to push you back line she is immune
[2022-12-19 12:51:22] <surelyURjokingMrFeynman> maybe he is coming in from the side
[2022-12-19 12:51:25] <GodofDhar> @spaxnooo yeah same
[2022-12-19 12:51:40] <spaxnooo> ok guys if she is in fortify she cant be pinned i didnt think i would have to specify this
[2022-12-19 12:51:47] <%GIRLinMaleBody> i hate to attack second point
[2022-12-19 12:51:54] <eburuma> Are you excited for overwatch world cup coming back?
[2022-12-19 12:51:56] <GodofDhar> u can charge from the front as well maybe not from like perfectly 0 degrees but otherwise u can
[2022-12-19 12:52:41] <GodofDhar> she also gets fast as fuck thats like main reason for me
[2022-12-19 12:52:45] <OneManArmystar> swing does 0 damage on Orisa
[2022-12-19 12:52:58] <%GIRLinMaleBody> swing heals orisa
[2022-12-19 12:53:25] <OneManArmystar> meanwhile she is doing bastion like damage non stop

[2022-12-19 12:54:28] <mmowenmann> they just stop everything you do
[2022-12-19 12:54:37] <OneManArmystar> Her entire kit screams Anti-Rein
[2022-12-19 12:54:52] <tirdni> from a doom counter, they made the hooves a counter for everything
[2022-12-19 12:55:01] <Jrspartan> how's everyone doin
[2022-12-19 12:55:03] <mmowenmann> they use their cooldowns one at a time with javelin and spin
[2022-12-19 12:55:13] <mmowenmann> then when theyre both down they fortify
[2022-12-19 12:55:14] <GodofDhar> lol cloudy thinks hes spaxnooo obviously ur gonna have trouble with it ur just not as talented or good as spaxnooo
[2022-12-19 12:55:20] <mmowenmann> then once fortify is over they use those abilities again
[2022-12-19 12:55:39] <%Kripp_mod_me_pls> cant even block her ult with my brig shield now :(
[2022-12-19 12:55:56] <OneManArmystar> Can doom punch through the spin?
[2022-12-19 12:55:56] <%TheeABCs> hog too good -> buff orisa to counter hog -> orisa even bigger rein counter
[2022-12-19 12:55:58] <spaxnooo> the ability cycle on orisa is with spin and fortify im pretty sure they javelin off cooldown
[2022-12-19 12:56:11] <tirdni> either hack the ult or kill the hooves. but killing her not that easy on ult
[2022-12-19 12:56:15] <GodofDhar> @TheeABCs yeah but the one orisa buff doesnt affect hog at all
[2022-12-19 12:56:19] <eburuma> Yo cloudy are u gonna apply for world cup?
[2022-12-19 12:56:23] <%TheeABCs> thats true
[2022-12-19 12:56:25] <terrestrialbug> it's dumb. you can block all ults except her?

[2022-12-19 13:06:31] <%GIRLinMaleBody> why are they asking flats and not u?
[2022-12-19 13:06:34] <%+Aceattack> the devs were in his chat saying that
[2022-12-19 13:06:34] <%torbjorn__love> maybe rein can fly?
[2022-12-19 13:06:39] <+babblingbrandon> they had developer in stream
[2022-12-19 13:06:43] <%Magicturtle12> flats asked for 250 charge dmg and dev offered 100dmg firestrike as a compromise
[2022-12-19 13:06:47] <N3o___> FLYING REIN PagMan
[2022-12-19 13:06:49] <DDawNeD> flats asked about reverting charge damage to what it was and dev answered with "what about buffing fire strike instead"
[2022-12-19 13:06:50] <endcosmos> no fish caught
[2022-12-19 13:06:55] <%GIRLinMaleBody> devs are stupid
[2022-12-19 13:07:06] <%+Jungleboogie30> they should buff speed while holding shield
[2022-12-19 13:07:09] <%islviking> if charge was 1 second less te
[2022-12-19 13:07:12] <%Apuphis> @GIRLinMaleBody rude
[2022-12-19 13:07:12] <surelyURjokingMrFeynman> booff
[2022-12-19 13:07:14] <!%emmy_ish> does rein even need a buff
[2022-12-19 13:07:17] <%islviking> rein would be dive tank
[2022-12-19 13:07:17] <akicam95> Sorry but I think Rein is fine. I think if Hog and kiriko get nerf , Rein would be OP AF.
[2022-12-19 13:07:17] <%torbjorn__love> they can make him fly
[2022-12-19 13:07:17] <Lepoks> @DDawNeD yeah but they were both laughing it was kinda a joke too
[2022-12-19 13:07:19] <+babblingbrandon> they were  more comfortable with firestrike instead of pin
[2022-12-19 13:07:23] <spaxnooo> reverting charge dmg is completely fair idk why they dont want it
[2022-12-19 13:07:25] <%GreenZero> movement speed buff would be nice
[2022-12-19 13:07:26] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @Apuphis they literally buffed sojourn prelast patch LUL
[2022-12-19 13:07:27] <!%emmy_ish> veiOMEGALUL
[2022-12-19 13:07:27] <%+Aceattack> rein pin is not comparable to hook. pin is high risk reward
[2022-12-19 13:07:40] <%islviking> i want 2 second less cooldoen on charge
[2022-12-19 13:07:45] <%islviking> then i would be train
[2022-12-19 13:07:59] <MistsTwitchAccount> they would either buff firestrike, charge damage or health if were thinking realistically, right?
[2022-12-19 13:07:59] <N3o___> only thing they need to do is fix his firestrike animation lowkey
[2022-12-19 13:08:11] <%+Aceattack> rein health does not need buff

[2022-12-19 13:09:52] <blinxxy> im worried that buffing firestrike back to 100 damage is gonna JQ him where the community reacts poorly and then he recieves a bunch of nerfs at the end of the season leaving him in a worse state

[2022-12-19 13:11:08] <endcosmos> 300hp sojourn
[2022-12-19 13:11:20] <+babblingbrandon> I think alot of people in ow1 didn't like that rein would throw a firestrike out and get killed cause there low and only diva can eat and sigma
[2022-12-19 13:11:20] <%+Aceattack> maybe buff hammer dmg instead of firestrike so he benefits more from closing distance
[2022-12-19 13:11:23] <%Kripp_mod_me_pls> 69 is better
[2022-12-19 13:11:26] <%torbjorn__love> Do you think ramattra will annoy u more than orisa?
[2022-12-19 13:11:30] <%Kripp_mod_me_pls> henry is right
[2022-12-19 13:11:42] <MistsTwitchAccount> buff hammer dmg to 95 kappa
[2022-12-19 13:11:43] <equalizer094> firestrike should apply burning effect on targets
[2022-12-19 13:11:47] <conels> Henry GIGACHAD
[2022-12-19 13:11:48] <+babblingbrandon> only I think a tank player should be rewarded if they hit 2 firestrikes that's a no brained
[2022-12-19 13:11:52] <+babblingbrandon> brainer*
[2022-12-19 13:11:53] <GodofDhar> @babblingbrandon i have never heard anyone complain that idk
[2022-12-19 13:11:54] <N3o___> Clueless
[2022-12-19 13:11:55] <Jrspartan> I think 100 dmg firestrike will only be viewed as OP if meta shifts to bap being played more. then again 180 dmg through bap ult still hits like a truck
[2022-12-19 13:11:55] <%+Aceattack> two swings should kill a squishy
[2022-12-19 13:12:04] <+babblingbrandon> 100000% dude
[2022-12-19 13:12:23] <%GIRLinMaleBody> nanoed rein firestrike is 150 dmg
[2022-12-19 13:12:34] <%GIRLinMaleBody> biiiig number
[2022-12-19 13:12:35] <+babblingbrandon> dps players that would good, like middle ranked maybe lower play without fear and just stand right next to rein at 100hp dumbb
[2022-12-19 13:12:46] <MistsTwitchAccount> oneshotting tracer MrDestructoid
[2022-12-19 13:12:48] <blinxxy> plus there are so many counters to firestrike like matrix, deflect, sig succ, etc. so if you got outplayed by firestrike thats kinda on you
[2022-12-19 13:12:48] <+babblingbrandon> bruh I can't type

[2022-12-19 15:28:53] <%Kakaobob> does he take 200 damage from blop if he is blocking?
[2022-12-19 15:29:05] <kevlar_alaviiva_> ram can block rein swings if he times his block right
[2022-12-19 15:29:05] <+marktpIaats> When ramatraa goes BUFF form its free shatters

[2022-12-19 15:37:33] <+Dia1> omg kitty rein
[2022-12-19 15:37:35] <kevlar_alaviiva_> wasn't the duration of torb's ult nerfed? it feels like the spraying doesn't last as long
[2022-12-19 15:37:45] <+AnUncommonMan> I'd rather have pin buffed to 250.
[2022-12-19 15:37:45] <%+H0Stile_> Rein only seems underpowered because of OP character like Roadhog
[2022-12-19 15:37:47] <+Pixzelated> should have bought this skin :(

[2022-12-19 15:38:40] <simon2572> they already said they are gonna rework hogs oneshot
[2022-12-19 15:38:40] <%D4sh13> Kiriko is the main problem xD

[2022-12-19 15:38:54] <+kahvinpuutostila> oh damn the hammer on this skin is actually pretty sweet, now i kinda regret not dropping that 10‚Ç¨ for it
[2022-12-19 15:38:55] <%+herpesfreesince3> Rein should get refunded a fire strike for every hit of any type you land pepelaugh
[2022-12-19 15:39:03] <kevlar_alaviiva_> @Aceattack that's a bit too op because the skill has so many other benefits. like genji for example, his dash refreshes on a kill but it doesn't do as much damage, doesn't travel as far, and doesn't crowd control as much
[2022-12-19 15:39:04] <h7d77> he will be useless
[2022-12-19 15:39:06] <h7d77> sad

[2022-12-19 15:46:19] <endcosmos> it goes further at the end of swing
[2022-12-19 15:46:22] <%D4sh13> How do you do the double swing?

[2022-12-19 15:46:42] <%Magicturtle12> the edges of the swing reach further, so when you look at an angle you can hit further h7d77
[2022-12-19 15:46:44] <molecular_mass> your tech training helped me a lot
[2022-12-19 15:46:47] <ghawi2001> cloudy where is handsome fiinnish man
[2022-12-19 15:46:51] <+kahvinpuutostila> isnt the hitbox a square, so the edges hit further?
[2022-12-19 15:46:55] <%anung> because the hammer hitbox is like a box or something so it goes wider on the sides
[2022-12-19 15:46:55] <%plinkotheklinko> ah okay thank you <3
[2022-12-19 15:46:56] <%D4sh13> So you don't really know how to? haha
[2022-12-19 15:47:03] <Dkk_ow> hit range is not a circle, kinda flat circle

[2022-12-19 15:50:58] <+AnUncommonMan> I have flanked in bronze. Catches them by surprise nearly every time.
[2022-12-19 15:51:08] <molecular_mass> is it worth giving up high ground to hit people if youre up in numbers?
[2022-12-19 15:51:29] <%darkphoenixempire> thats bronze man. ;D I am talking about diamond at least

[2022-12-19 16:07:03] <molecular_mass> @terrestrialbug changed in the hotfix
[2022-12-19 16:07:07] <+Dia1> it makes it better against heroes with shields and doesn't help it otherwise. stupid buff imo

[2022-12-19 16:07:50] <%+herpesfreesince3> @MaximilianYeet The key to this map imo is to ignore point and play it like its death match
[2022-12-19 16:08:18] <RatedIKing> @terrestrialbug yeah ik but the ult being able to pierce ults helps orisa
[2022-12-19 16:08:30] <RatedIKing> pierce shields*

[2022-12-19 16:57:09] <%+ajpeterson88> Do you think people will play Ram because they can or because hes the best option?
[2022-12-19 16:57:43] <PottsieOW> Nemesis form goes kinda crazy
[2022-12-19 16:58:26] <raylx79> I feel like playing rein translates well into his nemesis form

[2022-12-19 16:59:02] <%Magicturtle12> raylx79 idk it feels way more like reaper to me than rein
[2022-12-19 16:59:23] <%Magicturtle12> reins all about swinging around, ram is about hitting the punches
[2022-12-19 17:00:06] <raylx79> @magicturtle12 I meant how you have to know when to stay back and when to hard commit and stuff
[2022-12-19 17:00:29] <cheersMyFriends> can i link an emote?
