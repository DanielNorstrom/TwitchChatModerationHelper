[2023-01-04 02:16:24] <+SatisfiedFruit> Hello im thinking of buying tarkov and im wondering if you would recommend it
[2023-01-04 02:16:26] <turntablist_mk2> @hoyyt with the tts it gets hectic as u get bigger
[2023-01-04 02:16:40] <%hoyyt> i never said a name, im just saying, some people change.
[2023-01-04 02:16:43] <%+memorymurder> i don't think he's talking shit tho
[2023-01-04 02:16:44] <%+hyvlarN69> @hoyyt but pizza man averages 10k viewers and chat moves so fast, i totally get that you dont have the capacity to read messages
[2023-01-04 02:16:45] <%rgbsketchers> Your mindset for streaming is a good reason why I watch you all the time. I dont even play tark anymore
[2023-01-04 02:17:01] <%hoyyt> just wish everyone was as humble as you
[2023-01-04 02:17:07] <+doctortripleog> most wholesome dude on twitch 100%
[2023-01-04 02:17:14] <snubzie> I mean, Pizza guy is a great dude. When you get to a certain amount of people chatting you need to filter a little bit. Think about it from his perspective, you've got people donating, you need to recognize and appreciate them as well.
[2023-01-04 02:17:21] <+obillyy> tbf I think smaller chats are usually less toxic
[2023-01-04 02:17:21] <%hoyyt> @hyvlarN69 i dont have the capacity? lol what...
[2023-01-04 02:17:29] <%pewaccountant> there's no need to degrade other streamers. just be humble and happy in the chat you're in.

[2023-01-04 02:17:42] <%zebonglord> and the man is playing tarkov. cant read everything. i love both pizzaguy and willerz
[2023-01-04 02:17:47] <%+hyvlarN69> @hoyyt not you but the streamer
[2023-01-04 02:17:47] <ledezmandres> I mean, there is no room to speak bad about other streamers, they decide what is best for them, and they also have the consequences good and bad.
[2023-01-04 02:17:48] <mastermindxlk> imagine getting mad at a streamer not reading your message. Gotta have some shit going on upstairs if you think you deserve to be heard like that lol
[2023-01-04 02:17:49] <%jcon471> honestly willerz just puts out good vibes and that to me makes him a great streamer

[2023-01-04 17:19:29] <%Yeewak> @MaulCop Honestly, I give Will mad props... I loved the fuck out of this game when I first started playing, became addicted to it. Played it for 6-10 hours a day, and then spent all of my extra time consuming more information on it.... but then somewhere in last wipe, I lost the luster for it. I try to go back, hoping for that feeling, but I just end up leaving disappointed and frustrated. So I come to watch Will wreck kids and get that feeling. LOL

[2023-01-04 17:23:30] <+grovak> @MaulCop i didnt get in on alphe i was about a month late but i feel that for me im mostly sick of the same quest routine, even trying to differeitaite what quests i do when or how i finish certain kill quests isnt enough.   I want the full release experience and i still log in and enjoy the game but yea its not nearly the same as it used to feel, like when they added reserve before they added the weight system that was a pretty phenomenal patch

[2023-01-04 17:40:08] <%Deezil_Wood> @jcsparky16 I can't find the purple one but I found tons of the silver and red on woods.  Just in stashes, normal loot spots, even on the dead scavs.  That's the only map I've really done a lot of looting on though so there's probably better spots.

[2023-01-04 19:10:28] <%+blitzplayer99> @satansheterodad yeah it‚Äôs wayy better on other maps. Streets may have too many items and server side entities that is causing the issues. Customs, shoreline, woods and interchange are all really good. You might get one rubberband in the beginning, but that‚Äôs all

[2023-01-04 20:39:18] <S_mea_R> @3gloo practice offline factory with a loadout you will run routinely. Put scavs on high or horde, practice taking those shitheads out. Then just start running raids, and keep running them.

[2023-01-04 20:40:44] <%+ItsXenot1c_> @ItsHighlander from a guy that vaped 5 years straight, the nicotine withdraw is brutal. either quit cold turkey, chew gum when you get cravings or lower your nicotine levels slowly. Relapsing happens Im still vaping periodically now even tho ive quit

[2023-01-04 22:35:19] <brightfella> @brightfella Basically fixes the way how the PMC aims. Like when you aim normally the whole FOV shifts and zooms in. You can glitch it out and the gun comes to the screen and the FOV doesn't shift. Imma send you a link to the video. Klean made it a day ago
[2023-01-04 22:35:24] <%+blazinmonkey> manual is about the feeling - nothing more
