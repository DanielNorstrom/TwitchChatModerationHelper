[2022-12-15 18:46:37] <omar_ayman10> do you like the match point system ?
[2022-12-15 18:46:40] <%ColldEyes> yea that's what I don't like about matchpoint it's a meh format imo
[2022-12-15 18:47:25] <+evanz223> my problem with match point is that the season is just 6 games with the highest points winning and then tournaments are a different format
[2022-12-15 18:47:46] <YoungRudy223> yoo
[2022-12-15 18:47:48] <FindMisterNemo> I low key love the match point system. I think it makes sense to have to go out on a Win. would be miserable to see some team never win and take the cup

[2022-12-15 18:48:49] <%ColldEyes> Yea I get why it's there it's so people don't just int when they're losing a series, but the team who played the best doesn't necessarily win because of the format

[2022-12-15 21:39:18] <%PosAjdin> Her and like SashaGrey are great to watch because neckbeards come in trying to be neckbeards and it phases them zero

[2022-12-15 21:41:47] <%PosAjdin> Its way more funny when people legit dont realize her past career. Self-report set to 11 haha
[2022-12-15 21:42:21] <@%Kevachino> LMAO
[2022-12-15 21:42:29] <@%Kevachino> thats gotta be embarrassing for them
[2022-12-15 21:43:20] <%PosAjdin> Ive been there when shes called them out.. its pure comedy. Shes just "a bro" about it too haha

[2022-12-15 21:45:30] <%PosAjdin> It was like day 2 and I went and said hi, she said I was the first person to come up to her at all
[2022-12-15 21:46:13] <%PosAjdin> I feel that. There are a few people I wish I could share a drink with but maybe next twitch con

[2022-12-15 21:47:49] <%PosAjdin> She just does what any of us would do to secure the bag like what
[2022-12-15 21:47:57] <@%Kevachino> the whole "booby streamer" thing people label her as has people nervous to come up and show they recognize her
[2022-12-15 21:48:07] <@%Kevachino> @sebasbp28 howdy howdy
[2022-12-15 21:48:48] <@%Kevachino> thats funny tho how we probably saw each other if you went up to her LMAO
[2022-12-15 21:49:04] <@%Kevachino> @posajdin LUL no i agree, id go in full steam too cause why not

[2022-12-15 21:49:51] <%PosAjdin> Wait maybe!
[2022-12-15 21:50:04] <%PosAjdin> When I went up to here she was literally just by herself walking around.
[2022-12-15 21:50:20] <%PosAjdin> She said she was waiting for the homies though, if I stuck around I may have met yall haha
[2022-12-15 21:50:57] <@%Kevachino> oh LOL
[2022-12-15 21:51:15] <@%Kevachino> it was probably right after she went to a lunch with some friends

[2022-12-15 21:51:58] <@%Kevachino> ill take a shot but yeah def haha
[2022-12-15 21:52:00] <%PosAjdin> I was a Halo Infinite hopium inhaler and hit all those LANs
[2022-12-15 21:52:08] <%PosAjdin> It was fun but with so many pro teams exiting... meh
[2022-12-15 21:52:10] <@%Kevachino> idk if ill be going to next TC but ill be sure to say something if i do/dont
[2022-12-15 21:52:21] <%PosAjdin> I wanna hit some Apex LANs now
[2022-12-15 21:52:28] <@%Kevachino> also lan would be a stretch if it isnt like driving distance for me
[2022-12-15 21:52:38] <%PosAjdin> Well youll have beer waiting, or shot, or mixed drink. Im a Gin/Tonic man
[2022-12-15 21:52:48] <@%Kevachino> cause i cant afford a 1200 ticket to then spend another grand or two on hotels and shit
[2022-12-15 21:52:54] <@%Kevachino> LUL fair fair
[2022-12-15 21:53:07] <%PosAjdin> For Halo, from AZ I went to Kansas City and Orlando
[2022-12-15 21:53:28] <%PosAjdin> BnB early is the play trust. Even my round trip tickets were only like 400
[2022-12-15 21:53:38] <%PosAjdin> I say only.. it still hurt haha
[2022-12-15 21:53:58] <@%Kevachino> LUL i mean it always lightens the load too if you stay with people to split the cost
[2022-12-15 21:54:05] <%PosAjdin> But yeah knowing shameless streamers doesnt bother me at all
[2022-12-15 21:54:18] <%PosAjdin> I had the honor to mod for InvaderVie through the $5 fiasco
[2022-12-15 21:54:20] <%PosAjdin> what a time
[2022-12-15 21:54:52] <@%Kevachino> peach my best friend so trust i got 0 shame in it LMAO
[2022-12-15 21:54:57] <@%Kevachino> ah bless your heart for that one
[2022-12-15 21:54:57] <%PosAjdin> Oh yeah for Orlando our BnB was only like 250 for 3 people all weekend because I got it early and split it. My strat is usually lock it in then fill it after
[2022-12-15 21:54:58] <@%Kevachino> jeez
[2022-12-15 21:55:19] <%PosAjdin> Bruh at first I agreed she was a little outta line BUT THE THINGS PEOPLE SAID BACK
[2022-12-15 21:55:21] <%PosAjdin> like good lord
[2022-12-15 21:55:33] <%PosAjdin> No chat I ever mod could be worse outside of like Amo maybe
[2022-12-15 21:55:39] <@%Kevachino> for SD we did like 12 people in a BNB.. cost me like 4800 but was split between 12 so it wasnt that bad
[2022-12-15 21:55:54] <%PosAjdin> Jesus. 12?
[2022-12-15 21:55:59] <%PosAjdin> Yall get a castle?? haha

[2022-12-15 21:56:17] <%PosAjdin> Legit a castle on a hill
[2022-12-15 21:56:21] <@%Kevachino> ours was 10 minutes haha
[2022-12-15 21:56:50] <%PosAjdin> Thats nice. Next year I might wanna do that and go balls to the wall. A lot of my peeps didnt go this year but said they would next because COVID scare
[2022-12-15 21:57:18] <@%Kevachino> thats understandable
[2022-12-15 21:57:35] <@%Kevachino> all my homies just said fuck it LMAO... been too long
[2022-12-15 21:57:45] <%PosAjdin> yea I wasnt upset. Still a GREAT time
[2022-12-15 21:57:50] <%PosAjdin> I need more homies like that.
[2022-12-15 21:58:10] <%PosAjdin> I was ready to go balls to the wall but everyone was "worried for their health" or something
[2022-12-15 21:58:11] <@%Kevachino> NODDERS it was a hell of a good time

[2022-12-15 22:04:50] <%PosAjdin> Part of the reason I started watching Nikki so much was the connection to japanese culture, just so happens shes insane at the game thats got most my attention right now LUL
