[2022-12-16 21:27:16] <EdwardSnowDev> If Odin is bad in his own game mode I feel like something went wrong
[2022-12-16 21:27:40] <%+deppe00058> one shot achilles build could be fun in here too
[2022-12-16 21:28:17] <%+deppe00058> not for me, i suck at this game....but you would be fun to watch
[2022-12-16 21:28:26] <%+lightforceten> what do you mean, khepri is the premier magical auto attacker
[2022-12-16 21:28:26] <%+Stolen_AT_AT> Finally got to try this game mode. Itâs fun
[2022-12-16 21:28:26] <EdwardSnowDev> yeah kephri is not the bug for this mode

[2022-12-16 21:28:41] <InvadingZimm> @incon So if you ult everyone with your Odin and other teams get kills inside your ult do you get assists for every kill?
[2022-12-16 21:28:42] <%+deppe00058> barracuda went 2nd place with ganesha and sylvanus this AM
[2022-12-16 21:28:49] <%+deppe00058> it was painful to watch

[2022-12-16 21:31:08] <tomemily> Itâs not 6 kills but w/e
[2022-12-16 21:31:16] <%Chelios_x> @edwardsnowdev when anyone dies he gets movement speed and power for a couple of seconds
[2022-12-16 21:31:18] <%looster412> @EdwardSnowDev Odin is empowered as he escorts fallen warriors to Valhalla. Whenever any god dies on the battleground, Odin gains a bonus to Movement Speed and Power. This effect can stack up to 5 times.
[2022-12-16 21:31:18] <Zpudacuz> ref, that's a foul
[2022-12-16 21:31:19] <%+lightforceten> @EdwardSnowDev movement speed whenever anyone dies, and stacks whenever he gets a kill or assist in his cage. the stacks give power i think
