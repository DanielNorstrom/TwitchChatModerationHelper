[2022-12-17 00:00:17] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> we heard that rap is trending for 18-25 year olds, lets hire some random guy off soundcloud PepoG
[2022-12-17 00:00:20] <%+sixpathztv> He gets 2.9 million listers a month on spotify, but riot wanna make him look bad smh
[2022-12-17 00:00:29] <%+cottoncande> they shoulda had QT out here planning it rather than their execs tbh. literally anyone else
[2022-12-17 00:00:39] <%GlitterrJPG> yeah i agree I feel bad for the artist, it was a bad pick for the event
[2022-12-17 00:00:41] <%lucytbhhh> qt events >

[2022-12-17 00:00:45] <@%TenZ> honestly they shoulda just played out the performance
[2022-12-17 00:00:47] <nxtalieeeeee> Crown channel and riot trolling

[2022-12-17 00:00:51] <@%TenZ> no way they cut it halfway through
[2022-12-17 00:00:55] <spaghetinnie> They shoudlve kept the artist from the start and made them perform afain
[2022-12-17 00:00:55] <%+sixpathztv> Mike Dimes is the artist.
[2022-12-17 00:00:55] <%+cottoncande> riot said how do u do fellow kids
[2022-12-17 00:00:56] <%+notsnoop> yeah it was dumb to cut it
[2022-12-17 00:00:56] <%lucytbhhh> yeah cutting it makes it so much worse
[2022-12-17 00:01:00] <@%miss_lara_> @TenZ ICANT so awkward

[2022-12-17 00:01:06] <%+cottoncande> cutting it was extremely awkward
[2022-12-17 00:01:12] <zipperfork> Atp xqc could run the event better
[2022-12-17 00:01:12] <%lucytbhhh> having no outro too be serious OMEGALUL

[2022-12-17 00:01:16] <+spoonsforsale> especially mid song
[2022-12-17 00:01:17] <JacobG_5> And they cut it like mid-verse LMAO ICANT
[2022-12-17 00:01:23] <spaghetinnie> The way they just faded out the music and cut the camera’s tho
[2022-12-17 00:01:25] <%GlitterrJPG> yeah cutting it was mean to the person THEY hired
[2022-12-17 00:01:25] <%+sixpathztv> Don’t get me wrong, I love rap and never heard of Mike Dimes but a small search shows he an up and coming artist going viral on tiktok
[2022-12-17 00:01:26] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> didn't even let him finish his song Sadge
[2022-12-17 00:01:28] <nxtalieeeeee> It was mid song too hahha
[2022-12-17 00:01:30] <ShinyFangz> bad move to cut it tbh but it was soo funny
[2022-12-17 00:01:41] <%yoeyemo> @JacobG_5 I THOUGHT MY LAPTOP WAS ACTING UP WHEN THE VOLUME STARTED LOWERING
[2022-12-17 00:01:41] <ac3d1a_> @cottoncande I was cringing right before that and then i died out of cringe when they did that KEKW
[2022-12-17 00:01:43] <%killxjxy> Couldve atleast cut after a song to pretend like it was the end
[2022-12-17 00:01:45] <weenerboss> @shinyfangz i knowwww

[2022-12-17 00:01:56] <%+cottoncande> it wouldnt have been so bad if it hadnt been in the middle of a song tbh
[2022-12-17 00:02:01] <%+neyusong> the way he got cut off omgggg so awk
[2022-12-17 00:02:01] <%killxjxy> What was the prize
[2022-12-17 00:02:10] <%+sixpathztv> Nah they fr cut off the stream mid performance and think we wouldnt notice
[2022-12-17 00:02:11] <JacobG_5> I literally can't stop laughing ICANT

[2022-12-17 00:02:28] <ashh_dashh> myth did so good tho tbh
[2022-12-17 00:02:29] <@%TenZ> im listening to some of the lyrics
[2022-12-17 00:02:32] <spaghetinnie> They shouldve just waited until the song ended
[2022-12-17 00:02:36] <%killxjxy> Is it good
[2022-12-17 00:02:40] <sans_jelly> they handled this so bad fr fr
[2022-12-17 00:02:41] <%+cottoncande> the lyrics r not very FAMILY FRIENDLY

[2022-12-17 00:03:12] <ac3d1a_> however set him up probably getting fired and getting the blame
[2022-12-17 00:03:25] <%stachioo> some people were vibin then others just felt awkward there
[2022-12-17 00:03:29] <%+cottoncande> yeah it wasnt handled well altogether, even having the hosts improv the entire time. uncomfy
[2022-12-17 00:03:30] <ashh_dashh> kyedae likes rap just certain ones im pretty sure
[2022-12-17 00:03:33] <%+sixpathztv> Yeah no the event organizer getting fired after this one
[2022-12-17 00:03:39] <+Deep_Thinker> his songs aren't bad they just not for that setting

[2022-12-17 00:04:23] <+spoonsforsale> i was gonna say I can listen to some rap but that was just something else
[2022-12-17 00:04:25] <%+sixpathztv> yeah Mike Dimes is that underground, kinda low quality hype shit with no much meaning or great mixing.

[2022-12-17 00:08:24] <%+cottoncande> u know damn well they can’t afford 21 savage
[2022-12-17 00:08:24] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> especially not rn
[2022-12-17 00:08:25] <spaghetinnie> Crown casually tweeting like they just didnt get the biggest hate in their chat 10min ago ahahha
[2022-12-17 00:08:29] <%killxjxy> They probably could
[2022-12-17 00:08:33] <%+sixpathztv> Riot can’t afford 21?
[2022-12-17 00:08:35] <%+envvne> no way that 21 would do that anyawy
[2022-12-17 00:08:40] <%killxjxy> They have league
[2022-12-17 00:08:43] <ac3d1a_> Honestly Dabin could have closed too idk
[2022-12-17 00:08:44] <%+neyusong> they could afford JID
[2022-12-17 00:08:46] <%killxjxy> And their val skins expensive af
[2022-12-17 00:08:47] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> this is a streamer event not lcs
[2022-12-17 00:08:47] <%+BroItsTMoney> @nxtalieeeeee nope i say it all the time except at work
[2022-12-17 00:08:48] <%DamnICantCarry> riot just had world they can afford 21 and any other rapper xD
[2022-12-17 00:08:49] <%+neyusong> but yeh this event smaller ig
[2022-12-17 00:08:51] <ashh_dashh> just playing eaj's music while he walks around in a circle wouldve been amazing
[2022-12-17 00:08:58] <%+cottoncande> this is a smaller event
[2022-12-17 00:08:58] <%+neyusong> @ashh_dashh factual
[2022-12-17 00:09:01] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> chat completely ignoring context OMEGALUL
[2022-12-17 00:09:02] <gracebook99> @ashh_dashh yeah legit
[2022-12-17 00:09:02] <@%TenZ> JID is fire
[2022-12-17 00:09:12] <%killxjxy> Imean i wouldnt put 21 in there either anyways
[2022-12-17 00:09:12] <nxtalieeeeee> Eventually he’ll get tired of singing about sexualising women then lmao surely
[2022-12-17 00:09:13] <!%linaspook> JID is very gppd
[2022-12-17 00:09:17] <!%linaspook> good

[2022-12-17 00:09:24] <%+sixpathztv> Yo T, get on the mic bro
[2022-12-17 00:09:26] <spaghetinnie> They spend their budget on sets, if they didnt they could’ve hired a more expensive artist
[2022-12-17 00:09:26] <%+sara_ssb_> JID would have been a good pick for that
[2022-12-17 00:09:26] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> jid during the video game awards last year was 🔥
[2022-12-17 00:09:27] <%macaronine> oh the misery
[2022-12-17 00:09:28] <+spoonsforsale> @nxtalieeeeee yeah youd think
[2022-12-17 00:09:33] <%DamnICantCarry> @RafaelDeLaGhetto you cant say riot cant afford theyre taking our payments just fine and they made a ton on world for LoL xD
[2022-12-17 00:09:33] <%killxjxy> The daniel caesar and jid song is good i forget whats its called tho
[2022-12-17 00:09:37] <!%linaspook> anyone seeing keshi live for his tour
[2022-12-17 00:09:46] <Arcturus_ML> i think theres no reason to go out and hate on the guy he was hired to do a gig after all
[2022-12-17 00:09:50] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> @RafaelDeLaGhetto "completely ignoring context"
[2022-12-17 00:09:53] <Arcturus_ML> just the vibe was not it
[2022-12-17 00:10:03] <%+sixpathztv> Even Baby Keem couldnt be so out of the budget
[2022-12-17 00:10:07] <@^Nightbot> 100 Thieves just launched a new PODCAST NETWORK. Subscribe and watch me on Boomer vs Zoomer on YouTube →  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm63ADlzvTyQWAzTzCHxa6A
[2022-12-17 00:10:10] <%+cottoncande> nah im not hating on the artist i’m hating on the production team
[2022-12-17 00:10:15] <%+neyusong> @Arcturus_ML the way he approached the content creators was a bit cringe too but yeah
[2022-12-17 00:10:29] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> budgets are a thing people. riot doesn't just give event organizers blank checks.
[2022-12-17 00:10:30] <%+xanury> @Arcturus_ML bro just doing his job lmao
[2022-12-17 00:10:33] <ShinyFangz> defo not his crowd
[2022-12-17 00:10:33] <spaghetinnie> The vibe around the performance was just not it, the guy was doing his job
[2022-12-17 00:10:34] <%killxjxy> ‘How many games yall won????’
[2022-12-17 00:10:40] <!%tagbon> yeah no point hiring a "bitches" rapper and then expecting something different
[2022-12-17 00:10:44] <%+BroItsTMoney> @Arcturus_ML trying to hype crowd is cringe?
[2022-12-17 00:10:57] <Arcturus_ML> yea i mean, throw someone who doesnt know a thing about twitch streamers and thats what u get LOL
[2022-12-17 00:11:00] <@%TenZ> still waiting for kyedae to be free
[2022-12-17 00:11:00] <%+neyusong> @RafaelDeLaGhetto i mean there's no money involved in playing better music or having an ending speech or something
[2022-12-17 00:11:01] <%+envvne> that was not a crowd for his type of music
[2022-12-17 00:11:07] <@^Nightbot> Kyedae & TenZ get recognized in Japan! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o96DBXOO1Uk

[2022-12-17 00:11:14] <%+sixpathztv> Nah but dont hate mans for his lyrics, thats just his culture. Riot fucked up tho
[2022-12-17 00:11:20] <spaghetinnie> Kydae doing the “bounce” rn

[2022-12-17 00:11:36] <weenerboss> set her free
[2022-12-17 00:11:39] <Arcturus_ML> @RafaelDeLaGhetto i disagree, if they got a better fitting artist, it would promote the event with ppl wanting it to come back again
[2022-12-17 00:11:42] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> @RafaelDeLaGhetto i wasn't talking about the abrupt ending, just the thought of them spending more to have 21 savage perform than they would have on the whole event
[2022-12-17 00:11:42] <%DamnICantCarry> kyedaePrayge
[2022-12-17 00:11:42] <%killxjxy> @weenerboss Yeeeah i didnt know where to fit it in thanks KEK

[2022-12-17 00:12:10] <weenerboss> @killxjxy my man had nooo shame
[2022-12-17 00:12:20] <%+sixpathztv> @neyusong bro he a rapper. And if he say N and B, thats just his type of music. Aint no sense hating on what he writes
[2022-12-17 00:12:25] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> wait this was in atlanta?
[2022-12-17 00:12:31] <@%miss_lara_> yes
[2022-12-17 00:12:31] <%+sara_ssb_> Yes
[2022-12-17 00:12:31] <%killxjxy> Yea
[2022-12-17 00:12:38] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> they could've found a better rapper at the 7 eleven on the corner
[2022-12-17 00:12:41] <%+cottoncande> i live in georgia im an hour drive away from atl ill go pick kyedae up and save her  KEKW
[2022-12-17 00:12:41] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> unreal
[2022-12-17 00:12:42] <%+neyusong> @sixpathztv anyone can be a rapper and legit say whatever they want...it doesnt mean its their culture LOL
[2022-12-17 00:12:47] <@%TenZ> everyone has a preference on music choice
[2022-12-17 00:12:56] <%killxjxy> True
[2022-12-17 00:13:00] <@%TenZ> personally wasnt my taste but im sure there are people that like it
[2022-12-17 00:13:03] <spaghetinnie> Speaking facts
[2022-12-17 00:13:08] <weenerboss> real
[2022-12-17 00:13:10] <%+cottoncande> yup agree
[2022-12-17 00:13:11] <%+pokbubs> yeah
[2022-12-17 00:13:11] <%+sara_ssb_> Yes
[2022-12-17 00:13:16] <%+envvne> well we all saw myth having fun, no?
[2022-12-17 00:13:16] <%+skyemtws> for some reason some people do true
[2022-12-17 00:13:19] <+spoonsforsale> yeah apparently so. Just a weird choice for this crowd
[2022-12-17 00:13:20] <%DamnICantCarry> wasnt the right crowd correct
[2022-12-17 00:13:25] <%+spookymarss> #freekyedae
[2022-12-17 00:13:25] <%killxjxy> Id like it if i was in the mood probably just not rn
[2022-12-17 00:13:31] <%+sara_ssb_> Yes Myth seem to vibe with it
[2022-12-17 00:13:32] <%+neyusong> yeah maybe misogynistic ppl, jk lmao
[2022-12-17 00:13:45] <%killxjxy> Myth was tryna give that man some support
[2022-12-17 00:13:45] <%DamnICantCarry> myth vibes with anything though
[2022-12-17 00:13:47] <%+RafaelDeLaGhetto> myth is a vibe collector
[2022-12-17 00:13:51] <%+cottoncande> myth worked his ass off to save that entire event that man was gonna vibe no matter what
[2022-12-17 00:13:53] <spaghetinnie> I can see him working a full crown in a inclosed space, that wouldve been cool
[2022-12-17 00:14:00] <Arcturus_ML> his music is valid, its just i dont think an event with xchocobars and shipthur would be that kind of hard core rap LMfao
[2022-12-17 00:14:01] <%+sixpathztv> Myth actually a good caster, good on him
[2022-12-17 00:14:01] <spaghetinnie> Crowd*
[2022-12-17 00:14:02] <nxtalieeeeee> @neyusong I agree, culture doesn’t justify the disrespect
