[2022-12-19 09:33:57] <%AngaPeeters> seriously, that's what I think. He bought Twitter because he could. Just that. He probably had no intention of actually running it

[2022-12-19 09:34:38] <@%Neobullseye> @ReimHikari I personally suggest grabbing the original on PC/Steam, yeah. Make sure to patch the music files though.
[2022-12-19 09:34:44] <%Aurien__> he bought twitter as a bluff joke and it got called

[2022-12-19 09:59:22] <%TidusZecht> speaking of names translations of things to make them fit in with the language they're in, did yall know that Tom riddle had to be renamed to Elvis in the French translation of Harry Potter in order for him to rearrange his name in the chamber of secrets lol

[2022-12-19 10:04:34] <@%Neobullseye> Speaking of translations though!
[2022-12-19 10:05:14] VIEWERS: 251
[2022-12-19 10:05:22] <@%Neobullseye> That reminds me of a Dutch game guide that decided to translate some names in the game to Dutch -- despite no Dutch version existing.
[2022-12-19 10:05:36] <@%Neobullseye> Not only that, but they also did an abysmal job at it.
[2022-12-19 10:06:18] <@%Neobullseye> As a specific example, they translated "Lunatic Pandora" to "Pandora de gek", which translates back to "Pandora the madman."
[2022-12-19 10:06:31] <@%Neobullseye> So they turned a location into a person. Good job, translators!
[2022-12-19 10:06:55] <%Aurien__> I could see how that mistake could be made
[2022-12-19 10:07:15] VIEWERS: 251
[2022-12-19 10:08:01] <%AngaPeeters> The Dutch still translate names, and I wish they'd stop... example: Cedric Diggory (Harry Potter) became Carlo Kannewasser sevenBlank
[2022-12-19 10:08:36] <@%Neobullseye> It's an understandable mistake if you only have the script, yeah. But if you have the actual game to work with, you should never make that mistake.

[2022-12-19 11:22:22] <@%Neobullseye> Too much effort to write here, but yeah. Ellone tried to change the past, but failed -- or at least couldn't 'change' it beyond what was already destined to happen. Ultimecia's entire plan was similarly to change time and defy her fate, which was exactly what caused her fate to begin with.
[2022-12-19 11:22:34] <%TidusZecht> Zell chokes on his hot dog.... if you know what I mean bggLewd sevenLewd

[2022-12-19 11:23:40] <@%Neobullseye> I still say that Ultimecia is one of the saddest villains in the franchise, by the way.

[2022-12-19 11:23:46] <%Aurien__> maybe, its been about 24 years
[2022-12-19 11:23:50] <%TidusZecht> ellone wanted laguna to stay with raine so he'd be there when squall was born but as much as she tried to change it it couldn't happen
[2022-12-19 11:23:50] <%ooKaballoo> idk but from all FF games, for me FF13 Lightningțs return is the most pleasant ending for an FF game

[2022-12-19 11:49:34] <%+Kinitawowi> so when you get to select from (say) vivi's skills in battle you usually get four at a time in the menu, which fits in with how the game arranges them (fire/fira/firaga/sleep, then blizzard/blizzara/blizzaga/slow, etc) and you can scroll a page at a time; but in the remaster there's five at a time, so you get fire/fira/firaga/sleep/blizzard - looks and feels very inelegant

[2022-12-19 12:58:58] <%iwatchgamessometimes> you can potentially recruit a planet as a party member.
[2022-12-19 12:59:12] <%TwitchTemplar> I think it's more that none of those choices seem to matter much, same as all the magic combinations

[2022-12-19 14:09:50] <big4lil> Vivis journey (and OP Vivi thanks to Hot & Cold) are why the early parts of FF9 are so special
[2022-12-19 14:10:04] <%+Kinitawowi> how a black circle with two yellow circles can be that expressive

[2022-12-19 14:11:00] <@%Neobullseye> I'd liken him more to the Cloud of Darkness than anything else.
[2022-12-19 14:11:26] <%Neonlare> Ah yes, the FF with the coolest, worst Limit Break system
[2022-12-19 14:11:33] <@%Neobullseye> He's not the mastermind, nor is he planning anything in particular. He's a force of nature.
[2022-12-19 14:11:36] <%Neonlare> The one you -want- to use the limit breaks but can never do so efficiently
[2022-12-19 14:12:10] <%+Lady_Lorr> @endbeyondchaos it talks about lunarians a lot of you talk to npcs but it never comes out and says it, but Necron and Cloud if darkness are the two bosses that come out of literally no where
[2022-12-19 14:12:18] <big4lil> imagine if after the planet did its thing, Necron showed up at the end of FF7. with a white wing

[2022-12-19 14:53:52] <%+Vinitus> the only thing i dislike on 15 was the dlc things, i never played them, story things to get know your sidecharakters have to be inside the maingame for me
[2022-12-19 14:54:01] <%JoeGenoa> @Neobullseye hahaha thanks
[2022-12-19 14:54:15] <%+skonk93> 15 changed a ton since original release, i've not played it since it came out
[2022-12-19 14:54:26] <%TwitchTemplar> @Vinitus This is not the only thing but the worst
[2022-12-19 14:54:36] <%TidusZecht> it's supposed to be some kind of special boxes or something iirc

[2022-12-19 14:54:57] <%AlexiusY> I can't see XV in a positive light after realising it's a slightly altered Type0 reskin...
[2022-12-19 14:55:06] <%TwitchTemplar> I'd say they're main characters even
[2022-12-19 14:55:12] <%+Vinitus> @TwitchTemplar the rest of it i could enjoy I Platined it, but after that i never played again
[2022-12-19 14:55:43] <%TwitchTemplar> without having played 7 Remake I also can't understand how something Yuffie is not part of the main game, how is that a thing

[2022-12-19 14:56:09] <@%Neobullseye> My personal biggest issue with FF15 was that there's this large open world to explore... and then there's almost nothing to find in it, let alone in unmarked nooks and crannies.
[2022-12-19 14:56:41] VIEWERS: 520
[2022-12-19 14:56:54] <ljobenza> @AlexiusY XV, Type-0 and XIII all shared things with each other because they were part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series. XV and Type-0 were originally called Versus XIII and Agito XIII respectively.
[2022-12-19 14:57:07] <%+Kinitawowi> Dance
[2022-12-19 14:57:14] <@%Neobullseye> Also, there was false advertisement in how large the world was going to be. Lemme see if I can find the relevant pictures.
[2022-12-19 14:57:27] <+HeyAlanAlan> I think FF15 could have been A LOT better if Tabata was given more time to work on it. I think he did a great job under this pressure to finish it
[2022-12-19 14:57:33] <%AlexiusY> @AlexiusY the FNC thing is not what I mean. Tabata just reused Type0 to make his XV, you can tell they reused animations
[2022-12-19 14:57:40] <%+Kinitawowi> harsh
[2022-12-19 14:57:45] <%TwitchTemplar> Making it even larger with as little to do would've just been worse tho so good choice I guess
[2022-12-19 14:57:51] <%CynniUniflame> My biggest issue is that it is very open at first, lots of side quests etc. And then suddenly there's a tunnel of story from midgame till endgame that is more linear than FF13 XD

[2022-12-19 15:31:49] <%Neobullseye> It's a lot harder to break than FF7 and FF8, that's for sure.
[2022-12-19 15:31:52] <%crowguard_nmf> It's an easy game if you know all the tips and tricks and played it before and have a guide Kappa.

[2022-12-19 15:32:54] <%Neobullseye> FF7 also grants you a crapton of powerful skills, arguably even more so than FF8.

[2022-12-19 16:48:36] <@%RabidAmoeba> Personally, if you wanna feel like your getting the GREATEST experience you can. I'd say the Original Steam release of FF8 w/ or w/o mods is the best presentation. Especially, with the link to ChocoWorld active. @Miustachee

[2022-12-19 16:55:26] <%Neobullseye> At least the FF5 one didn't look that bad on tiny phone screens, and the general cartoony style worked well enough for the game. Contrast the FF6 one, which was just an outright butchering.

[2022-12-19 17:01:24] <%+Kinitawowi> i picked up all the gba remakes :)
[2022-12-19 17:01:34] <%Neobullseye> FF2's Soul of Rebirth was a 'neat idea, poor execution'. FF4's Lunar Dungeons, I never really got to. And screw the FF5/6 bonus content.

[2022-12-19 17:02:31] <%$Midnight_Vesper> I would have personally enjoyed more extra stuff in the pixel remasters.

[2022-12-19 17:07:12] <%Neobullseye> Kaiser Dragon was technically in the SNES version, yeah. It has stats, specific immunities, battle dialogue and everything. IIRC, it's even fightable if you use the right cheat to force the battle.

[2022-12-19 17:07:38] <%Neobullseye> That said, I'm not entirely sure how battle-y the battle is in terms of what the thing can do.
[2022-12-19 17:08:01] <%Neobullseye> Odds are it will only ever use physical attacks or something; most dummied enemies do exactly that.
