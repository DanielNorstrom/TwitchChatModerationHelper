[2022-12-25 23:11:35] <Cheezerbreezer> There must be some optimizations fresh set of eyes can see
[2022-12-25 23:11:36] <Vladimir_the_implyer> There's plenty of algorithm stuff you can do to clean it up and then you can add, you know, and option to remove items without some silly drawbridge hacks

[2022-12-25 23:11:52] <%Grin_42> it would take a lot of math and time and tears

[2022-12-25 23:11:56] <MichelozzoOnTwitch> The game is simulating *a lot* of shit. I don't think it can get better optimized until like, quantum computing becomes a thing that's commercially viable
[2022-12-25 23:12:02] <%EnigmaticRepose> I only know that x/X means damaged
[2022-12-25 23:12:03] <%michealjordy> limesSleepy
[2022-12-25 23:12:04] <Zakkai__> another tip to increase fps is to turn of temperature & weather in the options

[2022-12-25 23:12:58] <%earin_copper> @Vladimir_the_implyer I assume at least pathfinding could use some help to stop e.g. opening up a new path through a caverns Z-level occasionally killing the framerate
[2022-12-25 23:13:03] <Hypernoodle_Games> oof that was a punch in the 00's.
[2022-12-25 23:13:28] <MichelozzoOnTwitch> how does the death hallway kill?
[2022-12-25 23:13:35] <+autolockon> also issues where the AI will get stuck trying to do something impossible forever, like trying to plant seeds when they have no seeds.
[2022-12-25 23:13:42] <Vladimir_the_implyer> @Vladimir_the_implyer yeah, right now pathfinding is extremely straightforward and SLOW, you can shave off tons of calculation from it if you know how

[2022-12-25 23:42:42] <Mon0_chrome> I see whats happening in the game now but it is beyond my understanding
[2022-12-25 23:42:43] <%EnigmaticRepose> I think double x is like completely broken

[2022-12-25 23:42:54] <%EnigmaticRepose> Can't you just filter by typing in an X?
[2022-12-25 23:42:58] <AMERICA_YEA> @alt2221 think about it this way you can have enemies so heavy that your bridges don't work as traps on em in DF but if you have 3 bridges 2 holding up the center one you can drop the entire center bridge by raising the other 2 you might have lava under it or say 22 floors of drop
[2022-12-25 23:43:02] <%+sc00tz0r> yes x is worn and xx broken
[2022-12-25 23:43:03] <+rockjitsu> it's all automatic if the nobles really do console dwarves
[2022-12-25 23:43:16] <%ughdontmakemeregister> x just means frayed

[2022-12-25 23:43:38] <zizio> well at least before (worn) meant being worn on someone's body
