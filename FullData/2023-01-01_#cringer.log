[2023-01-01 17:45:24] <dogberry99> Well, that confirms Indonesia
[2023-01-01 17:45:28] <+GreatToothlessLandShark> sumatra is one of the islands
[2023-01-01 17:45:30] <Phara_Darr> Only been in east asia a ton, not so much in south east asia. So this is just a huge guess for me as well
[2023-01-01 17:45:31] <%gvwolf> Jakarta ?

[2023-01-01 20:52:04] <+Fozzilla> see no Monkeys on bridge, so must be fake
[2023-01-01 20:52:09] <+MatheusDiasVieira> Bolivia, of course
[2023-01-01 20:52:18] <%Purple_Gems> ohio

[2023-01-01 20:52:28] <%JediMasterTS> golden gate park - where the klingon warbird parked in ST4
[2023-01-01 20:52:29] <%Purple_Gems> lol
[2023-01-01 20:52:30] <N373r> Does not scale though
[2023-01-01 20:52:31] <%UncleElias> It's not golden NotLikeThis
[2023-01-01 20:52:42] <%manu_forti> no traffic, fake golden gate
[2023-01-01 20:52:43] <OceanSoul74> My friend's dream is to have his 70s Ford Escort pictured next to this bridge
[2023-01-01 20:52:49] <+bentspoon17> thats the north side
[2023-01-01 20:52:53] <N373r> retrievers are also gold, so what? @UncleElias
[2023-01-01 20:53:19] <N373r> are not
[2023-01-01 20:53:21] <ElemethSigma> @OceanSoul74 Why a 70's Ford Escort exactly though?
[2023-01-01 20:53:28] <%Spossss> Itâs clearly not a golden gate but a red bridge.
[2023-01-01 20:53:40] <+Da_Biff> ok
[2023-01-01 20:53:41] <%Purple_Gems> was fun
