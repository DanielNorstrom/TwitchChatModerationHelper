[2022-12-27 07:14:17] <+thegreatginbino> artichoke more of a texture than a flavor, tastes like whatever you want. one of the best sources of fiber too
[2022-12-27 07:14:17] <old_zaweri> cant wait for April early access

[2022-12-27 12:23:50] <%+Funk_Diggiddy> The devs don't care about getting rid of the cheating problem, they make money just banning their accounts know they'll just re-buy the game

[2022-12-27 12:25:17] <NeyreyanTV> regarding the cheaters, i blame the community, people like to buy things with real money. most cheaters are items sellers
[2022-12-27 12:25:22] <letsbrkitt3ns> i saw tarkov right when it was being released.
[2022-12-27 12:25:24] <+ReveralX> maybe they just busy with making that single player game
[2022-12-27 12:25:28] <%Bigbenzi> I just wish they would do some endgame and mix up the early game to not torture us with the shitty same quests again and again

[2022-12-27 12:25:42] <letsbrkitt3ns> looked like best game after day z but i never played it. just always seemed incomplete
[2022-12-27 12:25:46] <%JohnDoeRadio> Russia probably a wild place
[2022-12-27 12:25:51] <smokyapples> They make more money with cheaters In there game
[2022-12-27 12:25:53] <healoverdrone> its truely at a conspiracy theory level to understand whats goin on at BSG. I find no other explanations anymore for what is happenin with everything in tark xD
[2022-12-27 12:25:53] <CeraxusJax> Theres only a small handfull of Tarkov streamers i watch and Seq is 1 of'em
[2022-12-27 12:25:57] <%aramsham> @NeyreyanTV i've heard that in full release that won't happen with your main PMC, but I think there is going to be like seasonal pmcs too
[2022-12-27 12:25:59] <%+Dbrn47> Sometimes Dev/Publisher vision matters more than what the players want
[2022-12-27 12:26:17] <%+Funk_Diggiddy> I honestly bet the cheaters just offered to endlessly re-buy the game since cheaters make so much money off of the RMT for it
[2022-12-27 12:26:22] <absolut_billy> who buy item on a playtest?
[2022-12-27 12:26:28] <%+TexasDJ> Even Nikita said himself at a private developer conference that its best to keep your game in early access forever and laughed about it
[2022-12-27 12:26:29] <+FatedPhuture> new event just started for tarkov where everything is cheap so seems wipe is within a day or two

[2022-12-27 12:27:11] <gazmagz> so true
[2022-12-27 12:27:11] <fatlessbrownie> its an unrealistic expectation to expect players to behave in good faith, the responsibility lies with bsg
[2022-12-27 12:27:16] <magazinereloader> its pretty fucking tragic. after a day of work or stressful life situations and all you want is to play a nice game, nope here comes jimmy 360 spinning headshotting the lobby while spamming racial slurs into the mic

[2022-12-27 12:38:14] <%Nozm> @Sequisha there is a way to do a draft with specific players, but not directly in the client
[2022-12-27 12:38:17] <%+supa_lava> @ceraxusjax my commander would be nichol bold but ehh. modern for my boomer brain

[2022-12-27 12:45:04] <SaggyJello89> The secondary card market is a key metric for the game's health. And WotC's value is currently tanking so they can't afford to mess with it too much. Or they should be careful anyways
[2022-12-27 12:45:11] <%+supa_lava> they reprinted the power 9?? why tho lol

[2022-12-27 12:45:21] <AleksaMLG> You can get some cards if they are reprinted, there is also 'A list' which is a list of cards you can pull in the last slot in any of the packs, but black lotuses, and otther power 9s, no
[2022-12-27 12:45:25] <%+Leeche2> for a cash grab
