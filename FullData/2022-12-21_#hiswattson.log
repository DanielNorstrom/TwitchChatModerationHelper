[2022-12-21 16:20:07] <truck_nuts_> i feel like most people wait until they are financially stable, so you could have kids early and be ahead of the game. You don't want to retire and skill have kids at home IMO.

[2022-12-21 16:20:09] <littlemissbubs> i mean, if i may be explicit, im sure sperm count lowers over time, but men can have kids until the day they die. theres also always the risk of smth like testicular cancer and havning to have things removed etc. so like, you never know

[2022-12-21 16:20:53] <+TheOGWalt> there might be some risk for small cellular changes in sperm production but not as much. developmental defects and complications generally are more heavily dependent on the age of the mother.
