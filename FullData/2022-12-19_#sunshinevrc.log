[2022-12-19 23:38:57] <Mioshi> so what they are doing now is collecting cookies, there are 6 in total.
[2022-12-19 23:39:49] <Mioshi> when collected theyll appear on a plate in the van. once u have all 6 you bring the plate into the ghost room for the ghost to eat the cookies, which will turn the ghost into a santa ghost ( just puts a santa hat and stuff on the ghost)

[2022-12-19 23:40:44] <Mioshi> you either want to be hiding or outside the house when the ghost eats the cookies though because it automatically goes on a hunt, and if you die you dont get credit towards the trophy for that map
