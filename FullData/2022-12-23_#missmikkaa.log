[2022-12-23 17:29:40] <BladeMathews> @amandasifud I mean things effect people differently. It's fairly common within ADHD for people to be doing multiple things at once. We're often hyper-aware of things around us because of how easily distracted we can be, which I think lends help to this challenge. Prevents her from becoming too focused on just one screen
