[2023-01-04 16:07:03] <bigbaguette_69> rogue cards cost nothing so you draw 3
[2023-01-04 16:07:04] <%cizuss> its 2 mana draw 1
[2023-01-04 16:07:05] <zupa2552> yeah it's 2 draws on average

[2023-01-04 17:06:40] <ScamTree> rogue or druid right now, but historically rogue
[2023-01-04 17:06:44] <t_amas> boar and boon are high skill cap tho

[2023-01-04 17:06:55] <+cocococomango> Patron warrior was probably hardest deck to play
[2023-01-04 17:07:16] <gnurrgard> i found garrote to be harder than patron
[2023-01-04 17:07:21] <%synesthesia171> d6 lock hardest deck of all time tho
[2023-01-04 17:07:21] <C4rryM3> relics wait thats illegal
[2023-01-04 17:07:21] <%iNS4NE_HS> boar priest was the hardest deck ever don't @ me
[2023-01-04 17:07:22] <gnurrgard> in my personal experience
[2023-01-04 17:07:24] <Athanatov> Patron Warrior is only considered hard bc people were bad back then
[2023-01-04 17:07:24] <%iNS4NE_HS> patron not even close
[2023-01-04 17:07:28] <evta> druid is literraly noob king
[2023-01-04 17:07:35] <!%molino_hs> patron was hard because people didn't know how to play back then

[2023-01-04 17:07:48] <babyyshaark_> nomi priest was the hardest deck GIGACHAD
[2023-01-04 17:07:50] <%synesthesia171> @iNS4NE_HS nah that has to be d6, boar was too linear to compete with d6 on difficulty level
[2023-01-04 17:07:57] <@tictac_hs> Yeah Molino, pretty sure patron warrior wasn't nearly as hard as people still think it was
[2023-01-04 17:08:00] <%iNS4NE_HS> @synesthesia171 LOL dont talk
[2023-01-04 17:08:07] <%iNS4NE_HS> d6 is literally autopilot

[2023-01-04 17:08:27] <Zephyrz_> any malygos deck is hard
[2023-01-04 17:08:28] <gnurrgard> patron was my first legend, cant be that hard
[2023-01-04 17:08:32] <t_amas> I miss boar Sadge
[2023-01-04 17:08:35] <@tictac_hs> Totally agree, D6 wasn't hard it was pure muscle memory
[2023-01-04 17:08:46] <Athanatov> Kinda would like to see Patron meta in Classic so ppl will shut up about it

[2023-01-04 20:18:23] <%Annoyinmous> id rather lose turn 7 and get on with my day than sitting through turns
[2023-01-04 20:18:23] <Spaghetti100> Battlecry: win the game is hacky design as is being able to fill a deck with mana cheat like rogue DH and bless priest
[2023-01-04 20:18:23] <Vixeniita> I like playing mine lock

[2023-01-04 20:50:17] <@%^StreamElements> Quest Warrior looks like an absolutely menace at most ranks of ladder, though we expect it to barely be playable at top legend. It is very effective at preventing players who lack fundamentals from misplaying since the game plan is extremely straightforward and spelt out, but the deck has very little player agency, which means it falls flat against stronger players who know how to exploit its predictable play patterns

[2023-01-04 20:51:14] <@%^StreamElements> A common misconception seems to be "more individual random outcomes = less consistency", when the OPPOSITE is true. For example, the standard deviation of the sum of 10 coin flips (tails = 0, heads = 1) is smaller than the SD of one coin flip with 10x the weight (t = 0, h = 10).
