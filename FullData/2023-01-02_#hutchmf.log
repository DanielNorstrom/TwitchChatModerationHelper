[2023-01-02 20:09:54] <%ziffy20> there's a little pile right before the dock i believe, 2 feet away. think that's where camera goes
[2023-01-02 20:10:07] <%cammandocam> another way is to going in offline and view the map
[2023-01-02 20:10:08] <fetttii> Found 3 ledxs in a air drop yesterday
[2023-01-02 20:10:10] <TheKillaKhaled> watching streamers has to the be the best way to learn the game overall
[2023-01-02 20:10:16] <+Tibbits1234> i new customs before i even played the game lol

[2023-01-02 20:10:29] <+pineappled1ck> @ZachTheRipper_ Streams can help you learn callouts which helps, along with where to go/which routes are potentially better or worse
[2023-01-02 20:10:43] <BerzerkTyphoon> watch streamers with a 3rd party map out as well
[2023-01-02 20:10:44] <%+tread____> yuuup I tell everyone I refer this game 2 to watch people play first
[2023-01-02 20:10:44] <%$darozay> have a 2nd monitor with the map up and just joining lobbies helps alot.. dont be afraid to do a pistol run to just learn maps and extra
[2023-01-02 20:10:50] <hem1so> tick tick boom
[2023-01-02 20:10:52] <%ziffy20> there's plenty of streamers of tarkov, you could find a streamer that matches what you want to accomplish in the game and follow suite.

[2023-01-02 21:03:18] <%Dewy144> eddie hall has a tank and he is massive
[2023-01-02 21:03:20] <toxicgurr> @HutchMF what part of FL you live at?
[2023-01-02 21:03:20] <FrosT_Valor> yea like let me climb into this nuclear bomb and swim on the bottom of the ocean
[2023-01-02 21:03:23] <!%+lanej35ttv> it would be like a sardine can for you
[2023-01-02 21:03:23] <%+sageaequitas> yeah, that's way to tall to be a tank operator
[2023-01-02 21:03:25] <%ZackeyJay> it'd be snug, but you'd be aight
[2023-01-02 21:03:33] <ticryan12> A submarine is completely different. So much room compared to a tank
[2023-01-02 21:03:34] <%+taurusover9000> 6’7 and 3/4
[2023-01-02 21:03:36] <+eRevolt> eddie hall is only like 6'2
[2023-01-02 21:03:36] <%Blackheart010> 6'1 is the max for tankers
[2023-01-02 21:03:41] <CrowFlies00> Yeah thankfully every member of the army is 5ft tall or we wouldn't have tanks in the battlefield

[2023-01-02 21:08:12] <%thepopeofcopium> he tried the linkin park strat and in the end it didnt really matter
[2023-01-02 21:08:12] <%Blackheart010> is cms faster than surv?

[2023-01-02 22:15:58] <%Khrelix> i heard suppressed shots from a little further then him. someone else
[2023-01-02 22:15:59] <%+CBGAMING72> @darozay no he threw it behind the house
[2023-01-02 22:16:07] <MasonDesigns> go watch vod, suppressed 7.62 shot at you right as you killed first guy, then the guy you were fighting shot his mosin, and then when you went back m80 guy kills you from rocks
[2023-01-02 22:16:10] <%+RocknR00ster> I've had scavs run up straight behind me and one tap me without me ever hearing them.
[2023-01-02 22:16:10] <+sendyoadde> errands time?
[2023-01-02 22:16:12] <preznox> @Khrelix yeah i heard them
[2023-01-02 22:16:13] <+Nu_Dub> it's a multitude of things to be honest
[2023-01-02 22:16:15] <+Chris2Maximum> but thats why the wanted to release it right? so they can have feedback?
[2023-01-02 22:16:20] <%BREADnBUTTER299> if the bullet came from the left someone was probs up in the hill
[2023-01-02 22:16:20] <%Baeltox> ive 100% had more issues with this audio than the old one already
[2023-01-02 22:16:21] <Reigns> chat it wasnt the grenade. it was a shooter by bridge (near the guy hutch killed) - different than the guy around the house

[2023-01-02 22:17:00] <%captainmorgan120> he shot as the nade exploded so no chance to hear shot
