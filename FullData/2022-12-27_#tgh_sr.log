[2022-12-27 08:27:04] <+psychosheep42> from what I've seen the endgame is like 5x more ridiculous

[2022-12-27 09:04:19] <%Myrral> I've never seen Mirby in these stream once they're lying
[2022-12-27 09:04:20] <%Mirby_Studios> because you had to click a link that didn't appear until we went to sleep i guess
[2022-12-27 09:04:21] <llamaking__> It scammed several people :(
[2022-12-27 09:04:32] <%Mirby_Studios> moments are bullshit

[2022-12-27 09:06:29] <$ph0enixflame96> You had to be in the chat when the /moment command was activated. Another one of your mods came in late, saw the hype, and activated it, so anyone that had to leave immediately missed it
[2022-12-27 09:06:32] <%Mirby_Studios> yeah moments have to be initiated to be claimed

[2022-12-27 09:06:51] <%SweetLew_> what‚Äôs cohost??
[2022-12-27 09:07:07] <%Worldwide_Wimpy> we had what we call the 1970's wedding dinner LUL Beef, pasta, sausage LUL
[2022-12-27 09:07:08] <%Mirby_Studios> yeah it's dumb that it has to be that, and you only have 3 minutes to claim it
[2022-12-27 09:07:09] <@%CarloBrown> yeah if you don't click the claim button you don't get it
[2022-12-27 09:07:17] <llamaking__> I was there and tried to claim it, still didn't work for me. I think it failed for a few other people too, but oh well. Not a big deal

[2022-12-27 09:07:45] <Kappatechy> So, wait, what if you've just got stream going in the background when a Moment happens? Are you just hecked?
[2022-12-27 09:07:46] <%Mirby_Studios> like streamers should be able to give them out too
[2022-12-27 09:07:53] <%Mirby_Studios> yeah basically

[2022-12-27 10:29:03] <%Kailaria> although, being afraid of fire is also valid, lol
[2022-12-27 10:29:09] <%Nevawinta> rock should be super effective

[2022-12-27 10:29:17] <%sadib100> explain fire weak to water
[2022-12-27 10:29:18] <%WingedRegent> @ocyc Yeah some Dark moves are just what would be considered dirty tactics like Biting down on someone, Feinting an Attack, etc.
[2022-12-27 10:29:21] <%Styrmerino> dogs is a weakness
[2022-12-27 10:29:25] <%Worldwide_Wimpy> clap? stomp, stomp, clap???
[2022-12-27 10:29:37] <+CynthiaKnight> steel shouldn't be immune to poison. poison is crap, and acid can totally hurt metal
[2022-12-27 10:29:41] <%WingedRegent> It's also why Fighting beats Dark since Fighting types wouldn't fall for that and are more disciplined.
[2022-12-27 10:29:43] <ocyc> @WingedRegent I think you mean... FAINTING an attack Kappa
[2022-12-27 10:29:47] <%$Johnny_Boots> will evolving change your hidden power type?
[2022-12-27 10:29:50] <%CdudeGamer42> Do you get new moves when you evolve or just a stat reroll?
[2022-12-27 10:29:51] <%Kailaria> water puts out (non-grease, non-some-other-types) fire
[2022-12-27 10:30:04] <llamaking__> @johnny_boots Hidden power is based on IVs, so no
[2022-12-27 10:30:05] <Izandai> @CynthiaKnight Poison isn't acid, it's poison (usually), and you can't poison a robot.

[2022-12-27 10:30:49] <Izandai> @Kailaria Also the "dark" type in Japanese is literally the "evil" type.
[2022-12-27 10:30:50] <ocyc> okay so why is dark immune to psychic
[2022-12-27 10:30:59] <Nyancy_Cat> there should at least be *one* "acid" move that hits steel types, like freeze dry

[2022-12-27 11:04:47] <%WingedRegent> @Ralthien In fairness, it's not like a Full Restore is much different than a regular Potion this early in the game.

[2022-12-27 11:17:47] <@%^Nightbot> To promote a healthy community and chat environment for both other viewers and myself as a streamer, I have several words that are blocked from chat (rip, oof, reset, and a few others), and also prefer that you don't use F when I die or fail something in a run as I could not filter the single letter. If you try to send a message with one of these words, you will get an error message. I also purge pepe and pepe-related emotes. I hope you understand, and thank you for watching!

[2022-12-27 12:01:24] <%+flimmsovan> faves remained the same for Emerald?
[2022-12-27 12:01:30] <%Cryten0> does delkitty have a gimmick ability t make up for the stats?
[2022-12-27 12:01:39] <%$Johnny_Boots> does catching to escape stop you from pivoting here?
[2022-12-27 12:01:41] <llamaking__> No, Delcatty just sucks ass
[2022-12-27 12:01:51] <Nyancy_Cat> @Cryten0 cute charm normally
[2022-12-27 12:01:55] <%Kailaria> two d-bonds

[2022-12-27 12:02:13] <TushAvi> sad
[2022-12-27 12:02:14] <Ionic_Iris> hmm
[2022-12-27 12:02:14] <%Xandor123> You can catch these hands
[2022-12-27 12:02:16] <llamaking__> No, you can catch as many mons as you want as long as you don't look at their stats. if you check stats then you're committed to the mon and have to pivot @johnny_boots
[2022-12-27 12:02:18] <+BenlyAZ> It has Normalize as a signature ability starting gen 4, which kinda sucks
[2022-12-27 12:02:20] <victaghost> @Cryten0 not originally but it gets a gimmick ability later on, but its a drawback one lol
[2022-12-27 12:02:28] <%$Johnny_Boots> @llamaking__ thanks!
[2022-12-27 12:02:31] <LonesomeWalker91> probably just unlucky af ^^
[2022-12-27 12:02:34] <%p_fn_l> to be fair, it was like this most of the time in firered as well

[2022-12-27 13:16:21] <AmeSoso> @Kailaria there is a setting for that in the randomizer, a few people including myself did some doubles ironmon reimiCozy it's a lot of fun, but the lack of EXP available for two mons is rough.

[2022-12-27 14:41:31] <BluSubway> the skill in beating ironmon comes from not quitting

[2022-12-27 14:41:40] <+murixbob> so the tagline of Ironmon should be "Enjoy getting fucked!" got it.

[2022-12-27 14:41:50] <%S17Master> If you are not streaming and actually want a chance to win, I would strongly encourage using the Standard or Ultimate rulesets. They still add a decent challenge to the game, but are significantly less infuriating
[2022-12-27 14:42:10] <Nyancy_Cat> Ultimate is my suggestion; a good balance between a difficult ruleset but with sensible limitations
[2022-12-27 14:42:30] <%S17Master> And you can throw in some of the Kaizo rules to spice it up if you like
[2022-12-27 14:42:33] <%Kailaria> rerepeat ball
[2022-12-27 14:42:36] <+MarvErDas> I think i'm going to test it offstream with the less difficult rulesets and decide based on that
[2022-12-27 14:42:44] <llamaking__> Game is suddenly being nice this seed... I'm not sure how to feel about this
[2022-12-27 14:42:50] <italianosalato> hi, can someone link me a video or something to play kaizo on mac? pls im getting crazy

[2022-12-27 14:43:04] <hobrev> it is definitely from that nuzlocke family of challenges where some people do not like it because for the most part you dont get to play the game
[2022-12-27 14:43:20] <+murixbob> I think Bizhawk might be on mac
[2022-12-27 14:43:27] <hobrev> I know chris for example cant stand nuzlocke type pokemon challenges
[2022-12-27 14:43:32] <Nyancy_Cat> i would say it's a lot more purely "playing the game" - it's a single player competitive experience, almost

[2022-12-27 14:44:09] <@%fsvgm777> There's a BizHawk version that runs on Mac, but it's severely outdated and IIRC is based on a 1.x version.
