[2022-12-27 14:08:42] <%fofo8383> Streamers should eat before they start streaming. Eating while streaming, unless you put other content on and take the camera off you, is extremely bad manners and disgusting. "Streaming is a real job!" It is. But most streamers dont treat it like a real job. Between failing to make schedules, acting in a way that would be considered unprofessional, constantly calling off, etc etc. Content creation can be a real job. But most dont treat it as one.
[2022-12-27 14:08:42] <%+xenonNn630> there is another fight in that castle
[2022-12-27 14:08:43] <%pistrencejx> time for catacombs Break? brkBrows

I bought it, played it a bit and I've gotta say, the game is amazing, but honestly probably just not for me. I don't know if it's because I just can't handle dying over and over or if it's the fact that games like these are just not something that is made for me, but I can't mak

[2022-12-27 15:19:58] <%pistrencejx> the giant archers won't bother you, there is an air wall once you are pvp
[2022-12-27 15:19:58] <%+Iron_Mishima> Just ignore them - they can’t hit you when fighting the red dudes
[2022-12-27 15:20:00] <%Hennersy> Yeh
[2022-12-27 15:20:08] <%JimmyThickness> archers shouldnt bother you while you're in the fighting arena
[2022-12-27 15:20:08] <Rixstarian> @ACADArieS Why would he want to do that? He beat him.

[2022-12-27 16:49:23] <%MattySkullz> Pog
[2022-12-27 16:49:29] <lvl4weedle> I honestly tried to poison him but with venomous fang Kappa wouldn’t recommend that method

[2022-12-27 16:49:54] <+NovakNoLimit> I think there's multiple of these bosses...... I should really finish the game...
[2022-12-27 16:49:57] <%RepheX> can't you bait it falling off the cliff?
[2022-12-27 16:50:01] <%GumboMont> They nerfed Rot on bosses. Not sure about poison
[2022-12-27 16:50:11] <Holophraser> you can stop his charge with a heavy in the face, it's so satisfying
[2022-12-27 16:50:12] <%pistrencejx> @RepheX nope
[2022-12-27 16:50:16] <%+MMaRsu> NOOO
[2022-12-27 16:50:17] <Problematikz_> I cheese him with poison after 2 deaths lmao
[2022-12-27 16:50:18] <%+Garbodor__> call Aladdin?
[2022-12-27 16:50:20] <%+Loki57_> yeah theres like 3-4 of these in the game but this is the strongest one im pretty sure
[2022-12-27 16:50:24] <lvl4weedle> Once I realized my black flame did 1000 dmg I was fine LUL had no idea
[2022-12-27 16:50:29] <Holophraser> prbly needs a blunt weapon though
[2022-12-27 16:50:31] <%+MMaRsu> Summon ur lad at the beginning so u have flasks left

[2022-12-27 16:50:38] <+NovakNoLimit> I cheesed the hell out of the giant too. With some lad with arrows and then jumped off the wall and attacked A LOT, giant followed me and I won
[2022-12-27 16:50:39] <%+besci__> you might not be able to might need a heavier weapon
[2022-12-27 16:50:40] <%MattySkullz> he's gone grabbing a hammer
[2022-12-27 16:50:41] <caleb_chesscom> Mage with rock sling will slay this boss

[2022-12-27 16:50:58] <%MitosisDNB> @Holophraser not really. might look it, but it's not a crystal
[2022-12-27 16:51:02] <%+gluten_free_water> Black Flame on horseback is how I beat this one
[2022-12-27 16:51:02] <%SmokinDave73> maybe old mate oleg would be better then your mimic for this boss Break?
[2022-12-27 16:51:27] <%dizzybecks> hey break, you know, you don't actually have to fight this dude? you can just run away.
[2022-12-27 16:51:32] <+NovakNoLimit> My daughter wants me to play it and build a mage class. Too much for an 8 year old?
[2022-12-27 16:51:45] <Holophraser> might not work with katanas @break
[2022-12-27 16:51:50] VIEWERS: 837
[2022-12-27 16:51:53] <lvl4weedle> Yes running based
[2022-12-27 16:52:05] <Problematikz_> it definitely is a crystal boss but it's not like the others where his armor can be broken, gotta jump hit him in the face with a bleed build
[2022-12-27 16:52:06] <+NovakNoLimit> Anyone else get the rune buff and go kill that big ass dragon for over 100k runes? Right at the beginning I did that on every class
[2022-12-27 16:52:06] <%pistrencejx> there you go
[2022-12-27 16:52:07] <%SmokinDave73> @NovakNoLimit you daughter will watch you play?
[2022-12-27 16:52:09] <Holophraser> his eye is very sensitive
[2022-12-27 16:52:12] <%+iHunterGaming> 630+ damage
[2022-12-27 16:52:21] <%nick_mitsh1> same mental age as BerK @novaknolimit you should be fine

[2022-12-27 16:52:30] <lvl4weedle> Mage is easy flint stone pebble the whole game
[2022-12-27 16:52:43] <%GumboMont> @NovakNoLimit It's all relative. There are zombies and monsters. You'd know best.
[2022-12-27 16:52:56] <+NovakNoLimit> @SmokinDave73 oh ya, she's 100% a gamer. We are about to play that Zelda game. Not breath of the wild but the warrior one
[2022-12-27 16:53:00] <%pistrencejx> heal
[2022-12-27 16:53:02] <%MattySkullz> heal brkHmm
[2022-12-27 16:53:05] <%+Loki57_> he keeps forgetting the mimic costs HP pepeLaff
[2022-12-27 16:53:06] <Badr_Ansari> my advice is get rid of the Radagon talisman you have on, it makes you take too much damage
[2022-12-27 16:53:12] <%Pizzasalad> mimic costs HP
[2022-12-27 16:53:13] <%pistrencejx> mimic cost your hp
[2022-12-27 16:53:13] <%MitosisDNB> you were 15% hp
[2022-12-27 16:53:14] <%+Garbodor__> you had 5hp
[2022-12-27 16:53:17] <%MattySkullz> yea you had like 5% health
[2022-12-27 16:53:17] <+Rambinx> you didn't heal after summoning
[2022-12-27 16:53:17] <caleb_chesscom> @NovakNoLimit there are parts of this game that I would say are too much. Pretty graphic mutilation in some parts.
[2022-12-27 16:53:19] <+NovakNoLimit> I think MAYBE the cut scenes are too much but other than that I wouldnt think it's bad
[2022-12-27 16:53:23] <%DaveNF> My advice is Get Gud

[2022-12-27 16:53:53] <+NovakNoLimit> Chat, has he cheesed any fights? I wouldnt take him to do so
[2022-12-27 16:54:18] <Typogre_> I cannot get used to that scream LUL
[2022-12-27 16:54:18] <%+Loki57_> @NovakNoLimit hes on mimic tear + double katana so he's cheesed most of them FrogeNeat
[2022-12-27 16:54:21] <%chubbsunicorn> @NovakNoLimit there are a decent number of scenes that feature self mutilation, so it might be best to pick a path for her to go
[2022-12-27 16:54:24] <caleb_chesscom> @NovakNoLimit yeah it's really a few of the cutscenes like godrick and the old elden lord guy
[2022-12-27 16:54:27] <%+Loki57_> just kidding i cant really remember any outright cheesing
[2022-12-27 16:54:27] <+NovakNoLimit> IDK if mage builds are any fun anymore honestly. It was cool as hell to have some of them one shot
[2022-12-27 16:54:30] <lvl4weedle> The grafted guy cutscene
[2022-12-27 16:55:04] <+NovakNoLimit> Ya isn't the first boss pretty graphic with his arm? I cant remember
[2022-12-27 16:55:19] <%+Loki57_> yeah i wouldnt recommend the godrick 2nd phase cutscene for an 8 year old KEKL
[2022-12-27 16:55:22] <+NovakNoLimit> Doing good though, still have 8 heals
[2022-12-27 16:55:24] <lvl4weedle> I just used a sword primarily with my mage but u can definitely cheese it with their basic spells
[2022-12-27 16:55:33] <caleb_chesscom> I just did my first playthough with a mage. I could cheez almost every boss. That plus black knife tiche summon +10 is easy mode.
[2022-12-27 16:55:34] <%+Loki57_> godfrey 2nd phase cutscene as well
[2022-12-27 16:55:43] <caleb_chesscom> ^^
[2022-12-27 16:55:43] <%GumboMont> @NovakNoLimit My nieces let me know pretty quick if something scares them so not a big deal either way

[2022-12-27 17:50:16] <+Jaywel97> You should go to the mimic round table for the assassination quest before progressing this area or it becomes unobtainable plus its a sick looking armor set you get
[2022-12-27 17:51:09] <%GumboMont> I missed that first time round. Good shout
[2022-12-27 17:51:12] <!%xT1TANx> i do't think so
[2022-12-27 17:51:15] <+Jaywel97> Youve done 2 assassination quests right?
[2022-12-27 17:51:15] <%+besci__> is that the bone armor that slowly regen health?
[2022-12-27 17:51:29] <t3hAgentX> i think he needs to talk to bernahl to get access to it first
[2022-12-27 17:51:44] <%pistrencejx> ahh i see where you mean
[2022-12-27 17:51:55] <%Thadorus> Yea bernhal gives that letter
[2022-12-27 17:52:00] <!%xT1TANx> ^

[2022-12-27 17:52:07] <t3hAgentX> talk to bernahl in volcano manor
[2022-12-27 17:52:17] <%pistrencejx> that place. a bid door downstairs
[2022-12-27 17:52:30] <+ksubies> what does it mean when a sword has an x on it
[2022-12-27 17:52:31] <t3hAgentX> different quest
[2022-12-27 17:52:33] <+Jaywel97> Yeah theres a step now to go assist bernhal in the roundtable in the captial
[2022-12-27 17:53:01] <%Pizzasalad> cant use with current stats
[2022-12-27 17:53:05] <%Pizzasalad> thats what the x is
[2022-12-27 17:53:10] <+Jaywel97> Its a fake roundtable basically in the capital
[2022-12-27 17:53:15] <%GumboMont> I murdered him at the Warmaster's Shack first time though. regrets ninjaaD
[2022-12-27 17:53:20] <%+besci__> it means you dont require the right stats to use it correctly
[2022-12-27 17:53:24] <%MattySkullz> @ksubies means your stats are too low so you can utilise the weapon to its full potential
[2022-12-27 17:53:30] <%MattySkullz> *cant
[2022-12-27 17:53:43] <%pistrencejx> ahh

[2022-12-27 17:54:16] <t3hAgentX> YEP
[2022-12-27 17:54:18] <+Jaywel97> It becomes unobtainable otherwise if you progress any further
[2022-12-27 17:54:28] <%+rubiks_live> plot thickens
[2022-12-27 17:54:29] <+Jaywel97> Yes thats right
[2022-12-27 17:54:31] <+ksubies> and what do you think is the best class to start with ?
[2022-12-27 17:54:36] <%MattySkullz> the music in leyndell is sooooo good
[2022-12-27 17:55:04] <%numendisal> Samurai is the best for sure
[2022-12-27 17:55:13] <%numendisal> yea
[2022-12-27 17:55:15] <%GumboMont> @ksubies Doesn't matter much. You can respec later. Some start with better gear but you'll soon replace the starting gear anyways
[2022-12-27 17:55:18] <+Tmaserati> samurai and vagabond are good for beginners
[2022-12-27 17:55:19] <%numendisal> through re door
[2022-12-27 17:55:20] <%+besci__> theyre all good. you just need to find what you like
[2022-12-27 17:55:21] <%pistrencejx> into that door
[2022-12-27 17:55:21] <t3hAgentX> class doesn't matter a ton. mostly starting gear and stats
[2022-12-27 17:55:34] <%GumboMont> For pvp min-maxing is the only time starting class matters
[2022-12-27 17:55:40] <+ksubies> @gumbomont ok

[2022-12-27 18:40:08] <%pistrencejx> Break, if you go to Ranni's quest now, you will be able to collect stones +5 to +10, and spirit flowers +4 to +10. definitely rewarding. imagine you have +10 Oleg and +10 mimic. Your spirit lvl is only +4, which is seriously not enough in this area, should be at least +8. ANd that underground area is a lot easier than this.

[2022-12-27 18:55:42] <%$DBauernf> depends on the resolution.. prolly don't wanna play it in 4k on a 1070 yea
[2022-12-27 18:55:50] <%tez______> I completed it on an Etch A Sketch
