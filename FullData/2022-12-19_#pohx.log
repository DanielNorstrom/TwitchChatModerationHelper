[2022-12-19 16:22:05] <+AutomaticFrenzy> Checked the wiki and didn't see this answered. So we get massive damage reduction from ele hits, but is there anything we can do about non hit ele/spell damage?
[2022-12-19 16:22:07] <arkham1911> So if you had your chaos capped without a chest, would you use the brass dome?

[2022-12-19 16:22:37] <mysnaileatspizza> Awesome, thanks for the detailed response. I convinced my buddy to try RF but he rerolled because he said it was very difficult with league mechanic. I also have crashing issues, I lost a good run yesterday and it felt really bad.

[2022-12-19 17:37:58] <+gidley_> @Seabix its up to you. most skip it as you can craft 70% fire damge so its better to try and get multi if possible

What do you think about taking life master for -50% hp reg of enemies? I've just started mapping and affixes of elites with regen are kinda annyoing.
[2022-12-19 20:51:38] <@%GoGoLoThirty> dude thats gamers in general these days. its cause they got cucked in the past by shitty devs they think its ok to attack any dev, its a lame trend in gaming in the last 5 years

[2022-12-19 21:16:39] <DeazeNZ> Ive rolled 8 Horrors, and hit 2 helms with Socketed Minion Life + Socketed Minion Damage + Ele Damage
[2022-12-19 21:16:40] <grepnar> I gotta head out but thanks for the content and streams. I love what you're doing for the poe community adding incredible amounts of insight not only for rf but also poe in general
[2022-12-19 21:16:48] <doesbaddl> SSF Ruthless, found a pretty good corrupted 6L... if I had the supports, what would RF be in 3R3B? Or better 2 5L?
[2022-12-19 21:17:25] <@%GoGoLoThirty> ele focus as 3rd blue i guess... 3rd red less duration? idk

[2022-12-19 21:17:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> or wait we already have ele focus... just aoe i guess maybe
[2022-12-19 21:17:58] <cazlly> regardless of my understanding of damage calcs i appreciate your explanations!
[2022-12-19 21:18:21] <doesbaddl> RF AoE Ele Focus is 3 B

[2022-12-19 21:18:30] <+PlainSage> what happens when you hti 100?
[2022-12-19 21:18:31] <@%lemoncoolers> scoobie snacks
[2022-12-19 21:18:36] <doesbaddl> 3 Red would be? Lifetap + Burning Damage and less duration then?
[2022-12-19 21:18:37] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @cazlly theyre not overly complex after all the item and monster mods. the actual effect of resists on damage is straightforward. the problem is all the ways the game will change it up 😅
[2022-12-19 21:18:50] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @doesbaddl those are 3 reds
[2022-12-19 21:18:57] <+PlainSage> cool, whatever you do, i wish you a merry Christmas
[2022-12-19 21:19:05] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @doesbaddl sorry if that was a question then yes those are the 3
