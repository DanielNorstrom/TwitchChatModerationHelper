[2022-12-19 15:53:54] <prechoo> yeah same. Change ACE to 2 points and were golden
[2022-12-19 15:53:55] <%+fnplayer445sex> yeah ace should not be 3-0 imo too big advantage
[2022-12-19 15:54:15] <%tarpor_> the left after the looping is a fullspeeder if you exit more on the right ok

[2022-12-19 15:58:10] <%+ZerooGamer> just win imo
[2022-12-19 15:58:11] <!%Lackadal> so soulja was infront or behind previous cp?
[2022-12-19 15:58:13] <+Kevz95> yeah its last cp time, but i think name diff is funnier
[2022-12-19 15:58:16] <%mime_> in front
[2022-12-19 15:58:16] <nemetbar_> i think thats fair
[2022-12-19 15:58:17] <%+fnplayer445sex> bren and soulja run it back
[2022-12-19 15:58:18] <emjaay24> what do you think about ace to be 2 0 from 3 0
[2022-12-19 15:58:18] <vLukap> yeah but alliance needed 1 point there so it doesn't affect this situation
[2022-12-19 15:58:21] <$ForgettD> and what if all CP times are equal? monkaHmm
[2022-12-19 15:58:24] <!%Lackadal> so he was worse last sector
[2022-12-19 15:58:25] <nopey____> @Baashard no, the game runs at 100 ticks, and the thousandth is interpolated
[2022-12-19 15:58:26] <!%Bren_TM2> Soulja was ahead previous cp yes
[2022-12-19 15:58:27] <!%Lackadal> kuruHmm
[2022-12-19 15:58:27] <@%keby> its better than name diff or coin flip imo
[2022-12-19 15:58:27] <SSanoLIVE> 3-0 for the same time is brutal tho
[2022-12-19 15:58:28] <+Kevz95> if that's the tiebreaker they use, then I think its fair
[2022-12-19 15:58:28] <Epsilon_Kappa> and what if in the cp before they are equal Hmmm
[2022-12-19 15:58:34] <Chrono576> does the game not have a higher precision hidden in the backend and those numbers are just rounded?
[2022-12-19 15:58:39] <!%Lackadal> for sure keby
[2022-12-19 15:58:41] <%Maverick13589> if you have to decide a position it will never be fair Hmmm

[2022-12-19 15:58:47] <@%Kem_> okay, let's pretend mudda and otaaaq don't exist here and it's soulja vs bren on world cup 1v1 both finalist, what would you do
[2022-12-19 15:58:55] <Haeden_07> @Epsilon_Kappa the cp before that then xdd
[2022-12-19 15:58:58] <%+fnplayer445sex> 2-1 alliance i say or 3-1
[2022-12-19 15:59:00] VIEWERS: 573
[2022-12-19 15:59:06] <nopey____> maybe just eliminate them from what counts for a point, like 2-3 dont matter
[2022-12-19 15:59:09] <%scheiterhaufen_aus_money> i think in duo formats you can implement better solutions than cp or something. differenct lines also mean different cp times even tho they might be "equal" at the last cp

[2022-12-19 15:59:41] <prechoo> if equal times, the one who has best PB should be first
[2022-12-19 15:59:41] <%+sjoerdw> that is just moving the problem to be more unlikely, but not fixing it

[2022-12-19 16:00:05] <%+ZerooGamer> imo, times cancel out and mudda gets 1 and otaaaq gets 2nd, here, if it was a 1v1 its a draw
[2022-12-19 16:00:05] <%Artuvo> Maybe they already do a hidden 4th and this is the result COPIUM
[2022-12-19 16:00:06] <nemetbar_> but it would lead to confsion
[2022-12-19 16:00:06] <wentelini> last cp is a very bad choice in my opinion, it would make having more speed worse for no reason

[2022-12-19 16:01:19] <nopey____> i would just eliminate the drawn opponents from calculating the points from the round, in the off case this eliminates all players then its a drawn round
[2022-12-19 16:01:20] <+Shamo_TM> @sjoerdw because first player still won and last player still lost. would also be unfair
[2022-12-19 16:01:21] <nemetbar_> @Teizxamos best idea so far
[2022-12-19 16:01:24] <+Kevz95> the only truly fair way would be to drive another 1-to-1 to determine placing, but that would both take long and not be entertaining
[2022-12-19 16:01:26] <prechoo> @boomstick222 probably who passed more CPs

[2022-12-19 16:02:26] <@%Kem_> i guess there could be a "rule" where in case of ties, it is resolved in such a way, that results in the least point difference between the teams
[2022-12-19 16:02:29] <prechoo> campaign maps are way easier so ACE can happen more often

[2022-12-19 16:03:08] <!%Bren_TM2> @itsstevehappy you would need 3 wins to equal 1 ace

[2022-12-19 16:03:41] <CritterRole> 1-1 is a draw, 2-1 a close win, 2-0 a big win
[2022-12-19 16:03:43] <Iceman___S> @itsstevehappy it's effectively double the advantage

[2022-12-19 16:09:10] <an_E1> i think it would actually work if equal times would be ignored for calculating points, e.g. 1A 2B are equal, 2-1 win for whoever comes 3rd, 2A 3B are equal would result in draw, in a three way tie whoever comes first / last decides win or lose - but only 2-1 never 3-0 (aces shold be changed to 2-0 instead as well imo)
[2022-12-19 16:09:10] <nopey____> maybe resolve draws by giving the team that got 1st place in the round the win in the tie-break
