Helps when resetting chaos meter during certain mechs. 2. Make chaos meter and actual timer instead of looking at a small number on the buff icons

[2023-01-04 11:12:50] <%Eunactes> for me, i think gate 1 brel is easier than gate 1 clown
[2023-01-04 11:13:01] <%Eunactes> and gate 2 brel is hard just because of prokel

[2023-01-04 19:12:15] <bradleyking121> but u die less no?
[2023-01-04 19:12:24] <%alexgoham> sharpshooter just gets kind of frustrating to play if you play double class imo
[2023-01-04 19:12:34] <%alexgoham> when i play my deadeye, striker and sorc it feels so much easier to get my damage off
[2023-01-04 19:12:51] <bradleyking121> true
[2023-01-04 19:12:51] <Kurenboi> they will add 3 engraving so you can go triple engraving

[2023-01-04 19:22:08] <@%+Shikiro> @OfficialEfexas ahhh so i'm thinking it's the solo guy loading first over all 3 of you
[2023-01-04 19:22:36] <@%+Shikiro> cause the matchmaking wants to keep your party order
[2023-01-04 19:22:51] <OfficialEfexas> @Shikiro But it can't be

[2023-01-04 19:24:51] <%lostsoulz1010> wonder if theres a way to rework scouter and sh to be like barrage arti, which is technically a transform class
[2023-01-04 19:24:51] <OfficialEfexas> @Shikiro All 3 of us have to be faster than that solo player
[2023-01-04 19:24:54] <doggo131> because ATK is the goat
[2023-01-04 19:24:55] <@%+Shikiro> so it's like the system says oh they want to stay in the same party order so it waits till all 3 of you are loaded and then sends you in, in order.
[2023-01-04 19:25:09] <OfficialEfexas> @Shikiro Otherwise we will not get lead
[2023-01-04 19:25:22] <@%+Shikiro> yeah that's my assumption

[2023-01-04 19:26:23] <igormyotis> they need to add dmg besides crit rate for DI

[2023-01-04 19:27:09] <jajajaca8> shadowhunter doesnt do that much dmg

[2023-01-04 19:31:58] <%+ZeroTwo100> I believe transformation skill gems would be pretty pointless seeing as youre only in the transformed state for a limited time. the current system for just giving them the bonus on all skills while transformed is the most optimal.
