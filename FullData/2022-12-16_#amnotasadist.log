[2022-12-16 00:17:04] <bullshot> I strongly dislike olives on pizza, but if I have no other options, I usually pick every olive, stack em together into one bite so I can get it over with before enjoying the rest of the slice.
[2022-12-16 00:17:06] <TetraTesseract> ???
[2022-12-16 00:17:08] <leiiaa> i agree
[2022-12-16 00:17:12] <frogperson_28> that explains a lot about why the pizza tastes nasty... cherrys on pizza is bad
[2022-12-16 00:17:13] <commando_pan> Best topping is sausage on pizza
