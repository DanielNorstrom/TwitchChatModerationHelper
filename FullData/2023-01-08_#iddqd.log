[2023-01-08 00:02:31] <@%^Fossabot> Ok, we all know that there was a patch for OW2. The patch deleted all the vods that we had on our spreadsheet ready to review during the educational series. But never fear, we are here with a solution. If you have already submitted a vod and it has not been reviewed yet, please fill out the form below. If you have not already submitted a vod, please do not fill out the form! Any questions, please contact @AnoTheHero or @daisy82078. https://forms.gle/5YhJLxoSQ9jNRawr7
