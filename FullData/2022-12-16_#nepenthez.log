[2022-12-16 20:05:49] <muller59> its just a baseline spin nothing crazy
[2022-12-16 20:05:59] <%+ray_rockwood> If you got 525k coins to do the Ronaldo FB SBC, why not just save another 200k coins and get the Rulebreakers Ronaldo that is so much better?
[2022-12-16 20:06:07] <plasmagnite> I just faced the same guy in the cup 3 times and beat him all 3 times :(
[2022-12-16 20:06:15] <Mitchb1994> Tell me about it bro , I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs better know he‚Äôs del pierro tbh

[2022-12-16 20:06:39] <dylanwall120> Like fatigue
[2022-12-16 20:06:39] <muller59> but then again ive been talking L's too
[2022-12-16 20:06:41] <+reds7310> every sbc today is extortionately priced‚Ä¶
[2022-12-16 20:06:47] <+Jeeves14> @dylanwall120 take some vitamin D
[2022-12-16 20:06:56] <curlyrico> the best player sbc is messi
[2022-12-16 20:07:16] <dylanwall120> @jeeves14 Thanks
[2022-12-16 20:07:21] <%+ray_rockwood> @curlyrico Knowing EA they probably accidently put Crouch's face on FB Ronaldo. Hahaha
[2022-12-16 20:07:29] <muller59> messi is not the greatest
[2022-12-16 20:07:30] <$Th1sSecretN1nj4> promo is so dead. aa9Lol  1 hour in and 12/15 cards are under 400k
[2022-12-16 20:07:34] <muller59> you know how small messi is
[2022-12-16 20:07:34] <curlyrico> @ray_rockwood lol
[2022-12-16 20:07:38] <mym555> Any mods here?
[2022-12-16 20:07:42] <+Thack3r182> That could be a very long time before I sell the wc icon dalglish, if they don‚Äôt fix the faces sooj
[2022-12-16 20:07:43] <muller59> he is really tiny
[2022-12-16 20:07:47] <curlyrico> how messi not get 5 star kill on his new card WTF
[2022-12-16 20:08:07] <muller59> messi never had 5 star skills
[2022-12-16 20:08:07] <%+ray_rockwood> Petr Cech is still Schmiechel in game
[2022-12-16 20:08:11] <muller59> he is just really good dribbling
[2022-12-16 20:08:14] <muller59> the ball at feet
[2022-12-16 20:08:23] <+GeorgeH7_> WUGNH
[2022-12-16 20:08:32] <mym555> @nepenthez can i pay to ask a question!
[2022-12-16 20:08:33] <xRamiresx> nep maybe your headache could be cause you need glasses, i recently got my eyes checked and they said i could use +0.5 (which is really nothing) and that would help headaches i've been having lately, and maybe use blue light glasses for longer periods of gaming / screen time
[2022-12-16 20:08:33] <mym555> ?**
[2022-12-16 20:08:34] <Mitchb1994> Ray rock wood , yeah mines still broke too
[2022-12-16 20:08:36] <+Thack3r182> There‚Äôs no news on a fix though is there?
[2022-12-16 20:08:40] <%+ray_rockwood> Welcome back Nep
[2022-12-16 20:08:44] <curlyrico> @muller59 ronaldo got 5 star skills still and be honest, he fails his ronaldo chops
[2022-12-16 20:08:50] <muller59> hahha
[2022-12-16 20:08:52] <+wayney21> Gakpo TOTT tryout?
[2022-12-16 20:08:54] <Gifto__> Anyone in chat mind helping me with my squad pls
[2022-12-16 20:08:54] <a_boogz1> 100k packs are so bad
[2022-12-16 20:08:59] <lpd1996> games fully dead tbh, been sat trying to build a squad for over 2 hours and its just the same players as last fifa or the same players ive used multiple times this fifa anyways, ultra boring game with 0 fun
[2022-12-16 20:09:01] <muller59> ronaldo doesnt really do it anymore but he was a 5star skiller
[2022-12-16 20:09:04] <muller59> back in the day
[2022-12-16 20:09:04] <degraff9> Santa Nep! what did youget us for Christmas?
[2022-12-16 20:09:08] <+xpetrifyn> messi should definetly have 5 star skills
[2022-12-16 20:09:22] <mym555> nepenthez can i pay to ask a question?
[2022-12-16 20:09:29] <%+ray_rockwood> Why choose FB Ronaldo over Gold or Rulebreaker Ronaldo? Make it make sense? You can't
[2022-12-16 20:09:29] <kg1060> Does anybody know how many swap tokens will be available altogether ???
[2022-12-16 20:09:31] <+olli3_b> @muller59 now he just warms the bench Kappa
[2022-12-16 20:09:35] <mym555> @nepenthez can i pay to ask a question?
[2022-12-16 20:09:35] <curlyrico> @lpd1996 gotta build a team of players you like in real life bro
[2022-12-16 20:09:35] <muller59> @xpetrifyn when did messi ever perform 5 star skills ?
[2022-12-16 20:09:40] <%+major_flaw> i can't hear on my left ear because I got a otitis nedia
[2022-12-16 20:09:41] <%+aniron123> @mym555 that is a question
[2022-12-16 20:09:41] <jack_russell67> can't wait for the world cup to be over and just get back to normal content
[2022-12-16 20:09:50] <%theJFKexperience0> Tomorrow is the enemy of today
[2022-12-16 20:09:52] <+smokeymcpot_99> Flashback CR7 tryout LUL
[2022-12-16 20:09:55] <curlyrico> @muller59 nah only a step over lol
[2022-12-16 20:09:59] <%+sovereignsaint> call it early mate if you're not feeling well. we'd understand.
[2022-12-16 20:09:59] <lpd1996> they should remove chem if they are gonna have players with utter useless links
[2022-12-16 20:10:00] <muller59> hah
[2022-12-16 20:10:13] <seltorurial> what price do you thing dalot card will settle?

[2022-12-16 20:10:18] <Fifalord91> Evening Nep
[2022-12-16 20:10:26] <%theJFKexperience0> I wanna do CR7 cause he‚Äôs one of my favorite players but man 500k ? That‚Äôs crazy man
[2022-12-16 20:10:34] <ldgforlife> where is your headache located ?
[2022-12-16 20:10:39] <muller59> it is kinda crazy yes
[2022-12-16 20:10:40] <+jackthegamer_97> any token packs coming out
[2022-12-16 20:10:40] <%+ray_rockwood> Make Icons have links like the hero cards with a league bonus.
[2022-12-16 20:10:45] <muller59> expensive to say the least
[2022-12-16 20:10:47] <kg1060> Nep mate sorry to ask again but any idea how many World Cup swap token will be available?
[2022-12-16 20:10:49] <curlyrico> @theJFKexperience0 do it bro, you dont need chem cause it dont affect his stats
[2022-12-16 20:10:53] <ldgforlife> that‚Äôs due to posture
[2022-12-16 20:10:54] <mym555> @nepenthez thank you, I packed Mac allister, Gavi and Guerreiro, what should i do? Never packed during a promo before, will they go up at all from here, all currently around 30-70k. Thank you brother.
[2022-12-16 20:10:54] <muller59> but if u can untradable fodder him
[2022-12-16 20:10:54] <%+csmacph_> How long on the fb cr7 till it expires?
[2022-12-16 20:10:54] <seltorurial> what price do you thing dalot card will settle?
[2022-12-16 20:11:00] <muller59> i mean its still a lot of fodder
[2022-12-16 20:11:00] <%+Kieran96cfc> I get headaches behind my ears sometimes when ive laughed
[2022-12-16 20:11:05] <+jackthegamer_97> 12 mil lmao
[2022-12-16 20:11:13] <ldgforlife> headaches at the back of the skull are due to poor posture and stress on the neck
[2022-12-16 20:11:18] <+koojababy10> If they are supposed to be flashback cards, just have them link to the team/league they were at that current time. Messi-Barca link Ronaldo-MUFC link. Weird
[2022-12-16 20:11:33] <lucasostad> Do u think EA will change the Flashback to a club badge when he gets a club
[2022-12-16 20:11:36] <%Creativename_> where the hell is Amrabat, arguably the player of the tournament...
[2022-12-16 20:11:36] <+dylangomes8> How much is Silva
[2022-12-16 20:11:37] <%+normansrangers> dalot looks legit
[2022-12-16 20:11:39] <mym555> @nepenthez thank you, I packed Mac allister, Gavi and Guerreiro, what should i do? Never packed during a promo before, will they go up at all from here, all currently around 30-70k. Thank you brother.
[2022-12-16 20:11:43] <poolari> dalot not meta?
[2022-12-16 20:11:44] <muller59> @ldgforlife ok dokter
[2022-12-16 20:11:46] <Mitchb1994> Bit stinky init
[2022-12-16 20:11:47] <+GansoGo> game is dusted im afraid
[2022-12-16 20:11:53] <%+ray_rockwood> Why won't EA give us usable special Goalkeeper cards! I'm tired of using Inform Donnarumma!
[2022-12-16 20:11:55] <%blazer33x> gakpo is so cheap
[2022-12-16 20:12:03] <+jackthegamer_97> if no mbappe or messi it would be so bad
[2022-12-16 20:12:09] <+harrisgul17> Gvardial looks good
[2022-12-16 20:12:09] <+Hicko11> is foden a good card??
[2022-12-16 20:12:13] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Because there is so little desire for the mid to low cards and so little supply of the high rated cards
[2022-12-16 20:12:15] <%+whufcconnor> Perisic looks class for a CM
[2022-12-16 20:12:20] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Nah 94
[2022-12-16 20:12:22] <%+whufcconnor> he will be a pick up for me
[2022-12-16 20:12:23] <seltorurial> what price do you thing dalot card will settle?
[2022-12-16 20:12:24] <fcbdiegut> If you had 84x20 would you open for this promo nepenthez ???
[2022-12-16 20:12:30] <+GansoGo> at this point ea should just give out promos as reds
[2022-12-16 20:12:35] <%simplefifayt> #
[2022-12-16 20:12:35] <muller59> and in fifa u always have the change to build a cheap team with good players
[2022-12-16 20:12:39] <kierondrake> Very similar to SIlvas Flashback though
[2022-12-16 20:12:40] <muller59> from start to finish
[2022-12-16 20:12:40] <%+ray_rockwood> Silva's stamina is too low!
[2022-12-16 20:12:48] <+pr1reaperzz> Only Mbappe and Messi gets in my team. Free to play
[2022-12-16 20:12:52] <+JORDANKR94> hows silva cpmared to his flashback
[2022-12-16 20:13:02] <Brawnaldo> is there anything wrong with being a 4 win merchant in qualis?
[2022-12-16 20:13:06] <%$lfcplz> do they PTG cards get a +1 for winning the world cup or +2?
[2022-12-16 20:13:13] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> You happy with 6PM title and thumb for the new clip?
[2022-12-16 20:13:14] <a_boogz1> How does Saka not have one of these cards
[2022-12-16 20:13:15] <mattyg12> no menu grinding sucks
[2022-12-16 20:13:24] <Mitchb1994> Have wc players been upgraded ?
[2022-12-16 20:13:25] <%+ray_rockwood> The best thing is they changed Messi's work rates from low/low to High/low
[2022-12-16 20:13:26] <+xpetrifyn> play champs
[2022-12-16 20:13:27] <%+mattyjkellly> nep compare both flashback ronaldos
[2022-12-16 20:13:28] <+coletheg547> I wish there was a good sbc to look forward to completing
[2022-12-16 20:13:31] <Jalebigill> All I want for Christmas is league sbcs
[2022-12-16 20:13:37] <jancey07> Thought harry mags was in it
[2022-12-16 20:13:40] <muller59> menu grind is gonna be at TOTY , last 2 years i mamanged to pack 1
[2022-12-16 20:13:43] <muller59> just by grinding
[2022-12-16 20:13:44] <shembadingo> Ea might kill toty as well at this rate
[2022-12-16 20:13:46] <+always_rainy98> just played a guy with the new ronaldo, injured that guy within 5 mins. dont be cringe.
[2022-12-16 20:13:48] <+pr1reaperzz> Griezemann is mental
[2022-12-16 20:13:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Its 1/10
[2022-12-16 20:13:57] <a_boogz1> How does Saka not have one of these cards
[2022-12-16 20:13:59] <%$lfcplz> ah thats too bad. ive got Romero, wish he got an extra +1 instead of 5* skills
[2022-12-16 20:13:59] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> But happy to alter
[2022-12-16 20:14:15] <%ando1977> How are we supposed to pack these players apart from Store packs?
[2022-12-16 20:14:27] <+coletheg547> Content has been terrible all year it‚Äôs shocking
[2022-12-16 20:14:28] <mattyg12> a bit of menus and a game that isn't delayed as he'll would be nice
[2022-12-16 20:14:33] <muller59> really wanted england to beat france
[2022-12-16 20:14:36] <a_boogz1> I just packed one from the lvl 27 pack
[2022-12-16 20:14:43] <fordykyle1> I forgot Thiago silva had a flashback
[2022-12-16 20:14:53] <%+ray_rockwood> @lfcplz you are so right. PTG Romero getting 5 star wf/skills is pointless and silly.
[2022-12-16 20:15:01] <jayhood0588> cr7 please
[2022-12-16 20:15:04] <%+MachoHSV> Gavi would be discard if he wasn't gavi, if u know what i mean
[2022-12-16 20:15:04] <ajfromak88> Macallister should have way higher defending
[2022-12-16 20:15:06] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Might leave it an hour and then swap the things round "Flashback CR7 Is A Joke + World Cup Team Of The Tournament
[2022-12-16 20:15:07] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> "
[2022-12-16 20:15:07] <Gifto__> Who‚Äôs the best forward I can get for 100k
[2022-12-16 20:15:17] <%theJFKexperience0> Gvardiol is gonna be under 100k today! He‚Äôs insane

[2022-12-16 23:51:34] <%johnfive21> it's not constant pressure, just manual + R1 pressure
[2022-12-16 23:51:36] <%$Jakers9> My keeper couldn‚Äôt make a save either lol courtois was sick until i played today, so weird
[2022-12-16 23:51:37] <immichaelyouridol> @alfreddavidssonn Yep reffering to how the game helps players if the game was completely manual you would see the difference

[2022-12-16 23:52:15] <+psesh> He‚Äôs r1 pressing. Manuel pressing
[2022-12-16 23:52:17] <%smithy9996> I had two of these today. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äòguy is on constant‚Äô but he‚Äôs not as he loads of stam. Right stick boosting the whole time. Aggressive defending but leaving no gaps. I guess it‚Äôs just a play style and a good one
[2022-12-16 23:52:18] <harrypicko97> Surely he would have low stam
[2022-12-16 23:52:19] <69tw> i ve had those games where the opp team just seems to be all over yours, and you got no outs every single time

[2022-12-16 23:54:55] <$Mythirteen> the game just decided it had to be like that. slidders 100% on his side.
[2022-12-16 23:54:57] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Nep has a right to complain. We all do
[2022-12-16 23:55:02] <+always_rainy98> yeah we cant go back to old gen on pc :/
[2022-12-16 23:55:02] <$zahonlyegyptian> have you found the old gen gameplay more enjoyable?
[2022-12-16 23:55:05] <+sinhola> why do you play the ps4 version?
[2022-12-16 23:55:14] <%Prynner11> Evening nep
[2022-12-16 23:55:14] <ayyytrick> I dont think nep was even complaining lol
[2022-12-16 23:55:22] <+reece_1995> @jjaden10 yeah next gen only
[2022-12-16 23:55:25] <+tundebayode> !record
[2022-12-16 23:55:27] <SneakyRudolf> some times people just press me so hard and i wonder if they use something else besides constant press like team press or offside trap
[2022-12-16 23:55:28] <harrypicko97> Ban Hugo
[2022-12-16 23:55:29] <+israelolivos> Have to do swaps rn sigh
[2022-12-16 23:55:31] <harrypicko97> Everyone agree?
[2022-12-16 23:55:40] <SneakyRudolf> the press is just so hard
[2022-12-16 23:55:45] <hugobajen09> I like the stream just saying you dont always need to say something when its dosent go your way, just say okey nice goal to him and move him
[2022-12-16 23:55:48] <xcrimeprimerox> The gameplay is terrible
[2022-12-16 23:55:54] <immichaelyouridol> i think they like those kiss ass that are quiet about the gameplay which EA love
[2022-12-16 23:55:55] <hugobajen09> On
[2022-12-16 23:56:00] <harrypicko97> Be quiet Hugo
[2022-12-16 23:56:14] <%$Jakers9> So you‚Äôve never complained about the game @hugobajen09
[2022-12-16 23:56:21] <%jjaden10> @reece_1995 wouldn‚Äôt next gen theoretically be easier tho, PC‚Äôs ceiling might be high but the floor must be so bad in terms of player skill
[2022-12-16 23:56:27] <hugobajen09> Thanks just trying to give some help
[2022-12-16 23:56:32] <%krk0707> @hugobajen09 he did m8
[2022-12-16 23:56:35] <Richm1996> packed Kane from champs. taken it as an apology from EA for how shit gameplay was
[2022-12-16 23:56:36] <$Mythirteen> guys ignore him. just wants attention from nep and make him rage
[2022-12-16 23:56:38] <+madforlan> but hugo is wright
[2022-12-16 23:56:47] <%$Jakers9> Class spelling @madforlan
[2022-12-16 23:56:48] <ayyytrick> The irony LUL
[2022-12-16 23:56:57] <Naetep> take this with a pinch of salt but there are rumours simmering behind the scenes that microsoft are looking to get the rights for fifa
[2022-12-16 23:56:57] <+madforlan> its not nepp that has the same problems
