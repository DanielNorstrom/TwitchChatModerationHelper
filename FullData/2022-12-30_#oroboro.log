[2022-12-30 02:37:46] <SkeletalJester> Fists for me.
[2022-12-30 02:37:56] <$ChrissRivaini> my two favourites are the claws and the shield
[2022-12-30 02:38:14] <+thatmarcus> i did my entire first playthrough with only spear because i enjoyed it so much
[2022-12-30 02:38:17] <Gatol3> bow is the best, so fun
[2022-12-30 02:38:20] <%$Illuna_Meira> I like how stupid bow can get with different boons and upgrades

[2022-12-30 02:41:06] <!%Sir__Nova> It's good on fast attacking things
[2022-12-30 02:41:09] <RafTheRiffer> It adds flat damage to attack
[2022-12-30 02:41:17] <+sirdiesalot617> imo lightning isnt that good at all
[2022-12-30 02:41:22] <landkit> it need a lot of passives to be good
[2022-12-30 02:41:29] <%$Illuna_Meira> I try to get the main from dionysius, poseidon or ares
[2022-12-30 02:41:38] <%$Illuna_Meira> main hit upgrades*
[2022-12-30 02:41:58] <Legionofbacon> imo Zeus boons really shine when paired with Artemis boons, other than that its kinda meh

[2022-12-30 02:45:01] <DefiantOneGaming> what separates Hades from other roguelikes is the story and personality of the characters tbh

[2022-12-30 02:46:18] <DefiantOneGaming> I wouldn't be able to play this on a controller. Have spacebar as dash is way too comfortable for my playstyle

[2022-12-30 02:47:56] <%mythmakroxymore> 2 or 3. 3 is like Zeus Boon

[2022-12-30 03:28:57] <%keeran8894> IMO death defiance ios better, because even tho it's limited, you get to use multiple of them in a single room. which is far more common to happen with bosses
[2022-12-30 03:28:57] <Flipnip_Slipgrip> Also Zagreus spear is really weak unless you get just the right combination of boons

[2022-12-30 04:51:53] <%Pogarithmic> @mythmakroxymore Fair. It can take some getting used to, but it does work. Especially with hera/hidden shield aspect cast builds.
[2022-12-30 04:51:55] <Regretful> I don't like the ranged weapons shield/spear my bbs
[2022-12-30 04:52:01] <%SteveSketches> You ever get Blackout on Gloves though?  @mythmakroxymore
[2022-12-30 04:52:11] <Regretful> Athena dash is best dash imo

[2022-12-30 04:52:25] <%waynesmiley> bc if so yes it owns hard
[2022-12-30 04:52:31] <Regretful> don't forget ya cast

[2022-12-30 04:52:48] <chiyo721> @waynesmiley Hera bow is not the heatseaking one, it's the one with the casts
[2022-12-30 04:52:58] <Coal_Dust3> You load your cast into your shots. @waynesmiley
[2022-12-30 04:53:01] <%mythmakroxymore> Or if i did, i was underwhelmed

[2022-12-30 04:53:22] <chiyo721> Strongest cast with hera bow is probably athena cast with parting shot though

[2022-12-30 04:53:35] <LoonyNo7> deflect attack seems good with the charge
[2022-12-30 04:53:42] <Regretful> deflect is good with shield

[2022-12-30 04:53:51] <%SteveSketches> @chiyo721 Hmmm, I've never tried that.
[2022-12-30 04:53:58] <Coal_Dust3> Attack is fast enough to make is viable
[2022-12-30 04:54:09] <Legionofbacon> deflect on shield attack is nice cause the attack range is THICC
[2022-12-30 04:54:13] <chiyo721> @SteveSketches The way the hitboxes work out it backstabs with the cast if you hit an enemy in the front with a loaded shot
[2022-12-30 04:54:24] <%SteveSketches> Huh, interesting.
[2022-12-30 04:54:40] <%SteveSketches> I woulda thought that Aphro cast would be better for Parting Shot on bow, more raw base damage.
[2022-12-30 04:55:03] <%mythmakroxymore> @pogarithmic yeah i still have to unlock like 2 aspects on my easymode save.
[2022-12-30 04:55:08] <chiyo721> Getting parting shot to work with hera is weird though, so that's why athena cast is nice with it since it's predictable

[2022-12-30 04:56:27] <%mythmakroxymore> @regretful like coding? I’m probably not at the right level.
[2022-12-30 04:56:41] <chiyo721> @SteveSketches Artemis shot is great with mirage shot on it too. That's another fun one also makes it easier to get Fully Loaded
[2022-12-30 04:56:50] <Regretful> they finally made it where Azumarill and Iron hands aren't op on this guy
[2022-12-30 04:56:52] <Coal_Dust3> I heard it’s fun, but I lost interest in pokemon a while ago
[2022-12-30 04:56:56] <Regretful> @mythmakroxymore huh
[2022-12-30 04:56:57] <%SteveSketches> True, fully loaded is a good time.

[2022-12-30 06:31:48] <Legionofbacon> and your dash strike i belive is already in your melee sequence

[2022-12-30 06:32:56] <%nola_epeeist> @carrmig , there are rng situations where the door rewards bag gets fucked and you never end up in front of an eligible door for the second gMm

[2022-12-30 06:33:12] <%Cody_Ross> The speedruns for this game are nuts
[2022-12-30 06:33:16] <%KungFuAndrew> Yeah, that is a lot of RNG
[2022-12-30 06:33:19] <+VanOnTheMoon> this is fiiiiiiine
[2022-12-30 06:33:21] <%+ms_p_dorkle> I didn't know this until way too late. if you catch it quickly it increases the rarity of the fish you catch
[2022-12-30 06:33:23] <Legionofbacon> you can afford it all, may as well
[2022-12-30 06:33:25] <%yugo_kale> might as well do minecraft at that point
[2022-12-30 06:33:30] <kingpinxxx> buy all?

[2022-12-30 06:34:38] <%nola_epeeist> there's also a completely non-rng speedrun category using rng manips.

[2022-12-30 06:34:53] <%yugo_kale> may get lucky later
[2022-12-30 06:34:56] <BitsySweet> pom could upgrade attack damage

[2022-12-30 06:38:22] <%yugo_kale> yep position Zeus best combo imo

[2022-12-30 06:47:57] <%jigglejuicegamez> @KungFuAndrew athena is top tier
[2022-12-30 06:47:58] <Legionofbacon> @KungFuAndrew its a weapon to weapon basis really
[2022-12-30 06:48:08] <%mythmakroxymore> @jigglejuicegamez nah, i tried that out earlier too. It’s really good for shredding bosses but you need survivability and something for big crowds.
[2022-12-30 06:48:08] <zehdre> @KungFuAndrew They all depend on the weapon you're using in terms of effectiveness.

[2022-12-30 06:49:14] <%nola_epeeist> @kungfuandrew , some are stronger on average. but there are good builds you can make with any of them.
[2022-12-30 06:49:18] <%mythmakroxymore> @jigglejuicegamez dionysus boons, particularly on fists.
[2022-12-30 06:49:18] <1_Void_Walker_1> Spear best boi

[2022-12-30 06:49:46] <%KungFuAndrew> @nola_epeeist That's good to know. So you won't get totally screwed if you get a lower tier set of boons then
[2022-12-30 06:49:48] <%mythmakroxymore> Dio on zeus is crazy.
[2022-12-30 06:49:52] <+HeroSparky> Yeah you can put like poison on it and it procs everything

[2022-12-30 06:51:13] <%jigglejuicegamez> @mythmakroxymore i havnt myself found a good run with hangover, i thought it was decent on gun but i prefer a higher damage base then damage over time, espcially since the dot only really comes into effect on bosses
[2022-12-30 06:51:29] <%KungFuAndrew> Everyone's so nice about answering my dumb questions, thanks all oroHeart
[2022-12-30 06:51:38] <%jigglejuicegamez> most enemies are dead before you get the full stack of hangover so
[2022-12-30 06:51:51] <Legionofbacon> @jigglejuicegamez its great on gun
[2022-12-30 06:52:02] <lordaizen_redlotus> not really on some weapons
[2022-12-30 06:52:29] VIEWERS: 695
[2022-12-30 06:52:36] <%jigglejuicegamez> but i guess it could be better in the 3rd area, when you got those spear and sword enemies, but i cant imagen the dot carries over to their 2nd form.
[2022-12-30 06:52:38] <%AllyJugg> oroJAM
[2022-12-30 06:52:41] <%nola_epeeist> problem with hangover is that different sources don't stack
[2022-12-30 06:52:52] <lordaizen_redlotus> hangover op on rama bow though
[2022-12-30 06:53:03] <%nola_epeeist> and it doesn't normally have synergy with other dio stuff.
[2022-12-30 06:53:11] <lordaizen_redlotus> and so is doom
[2022-12-30 06:53:20] <%jigglejuicegamez> doom is great
[2022-12-30 06:53:33] <%nola_epeeist> so, you can't do a hangover "build" like you cN with doom. you can add hangover to something to get an effect
[2022-12-30 06:53:44] <%jigglejuicegamez> espcially when you get the ability to stack doom
[2022-12-30 06:53:53] <%KungFuAndrew> I fucking love doom, but you're probably not talking about the 1993 game :D

[2022-12-30 06:55:30] <%nola_epeeist> if you finish trying stuff by checking off the list, you'll have a better sense of what you like and what is "good". but we can 100% get a speedrunner in here if you want a walk through of what maxed out damage looks like or something
[2022-12-30 06:55:40] <%+Teacher_Tim> yeah, i love Hera bow. but some can't stand it. each their own

[2022-12-30 07:43:13] <%Pogarithmic> Charged shot is ridiculously good
[2022-12-30 07:43:19] <carrmig> the larger area dash strike is cool
[2022-12-30 07:43:19] <+nazzul64> why 2?
[2022-12-30 07:43:20] <%nola_epeeist> can you charge shot while shield is spinning? I don't remember
[2022-12-30 07:43:21] <!%KayleNikita> i'd say one
[2022-12-30 07:43:32] <!%KayleNikita> hit's twice and keep foes in special
[2022-12-30 07:43:33] <sineporf> 3 is fine too. you play passive
[2022-12-30 07:43:35] <%Pogarithmic> It also goes through shields
[2022-12-30 07:43:37] <just_myles> Wouldn’t 3 slow him down?
[2022-12-30 07:43:42] <%GoddamnWizard> You can with Zeus shield
[2022-12-30 07:43:43] <%nola_epeeist> I would hope you can

[2022-12-30 07:43:50] <sineporf> yes
[2022-12-30 07:43:51] <zehdre> You can use the shield while it spins, you've been attacking with it
[2022-12-30 07:43:55] <%Pogarithmic> It works with the special
[2022-12-30 07:43:57] <1targus1> 1
[2022-12-30 07:44:02] <%Tooff3> Double hit because then you can’t knock foes out of your spinny shield! oroRoll
[2022-12-30 07:44:03] <%makkoU> 1 because chariots knock back when you attack you need them to stay put when you attack them
[2022-12-30 07:44:06] <%TenkaichiBudokai> 1 seems ideal

[2022-12-30 07:51:55] <%nola_epeeist> there was once a race where the runner had taken all the boons from a God and had all his core boons filled but attack. got offered three replacements and no attack.
[2022-12-30 07:51:57] <!%xperimentalsubject> Do it for the 2.5k damage
[2022-12-30 07:52:00] <+HeroSparky> Charm does a shit tonne of damage if you let it max out
