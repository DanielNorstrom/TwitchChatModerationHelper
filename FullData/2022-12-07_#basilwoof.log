[2022-12-07 00:01:29] <DrSakusei> @basilwoof I want you to know how much you've inspired. Just the last few days I've been working on a ref sheet for myself and busting out 2 sketches with coloring both taking an hour each when it takes weeks for me to finish just a sketch. You've inspired me to keep pushing no matter what it looks like and improve thank you for all you do! drsakuLove

[2022-12-07 00:25:46] <LittleKnightOfTheRuins> I had my first experience in VR where little kids were cursing at each other and other players in very nasty way, and screaming. Not to mention the models they were using

[2022-12-07 01:53:11] <munchkinducky> I would def say the fever will get worse before it dies down. I had to hop between tylenol and ibuprofen every 6 hours to beat up my fever. But if it's covid, just tylenol

[2022-12-07 01:53:49] <$Uncl3BAMF> Cheer100 I got Covid two days before Christmas. It started slow, having cold hands during the morning, I thought I was just tired. Then I had shivers, and went home early from work. By the time I crawled into bed, I was shivering, with all of my clothes on, under three layers of blankets, and a space heater on me - and I was still shivering and cold. Beyond that, I also had terrible aches. Covid hits differently for everyone, but I was lucky. I hope you rest well Basil, hang in there!
