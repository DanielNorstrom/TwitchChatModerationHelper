[2022-12-15 17:43:54] <@%+strengthie> 90% of people that say it doesn't do anything are full of shit
[2022-12-15 17:43:57] <%+TrickmasteH> There is a guy in China that ran a 4:12 marathon while chain smoking ciggeretees.
[2022-12-15 17:44:00] <%+TrickmasteH> Recently.
[2022-12-15 17:44:13] <@%ragingqueen666> @polig and they most likely smoke something else with that weed KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:44:17] <%+TrickmasteH> Well i was only commenting on what you said lol
[2022-12-15 17:44:21] <%polig> @ragingqueen666 that is the thing i like to just walk out and relax 10 times a day, if i do that with week ill be cooked xD
[2022-12-15 17:44:34] <%+TrickmasteH> Like the "exceptional" person i mean
[2022-12-15 17:44:38] <%Jimotthy> My brother was a straight A student and then he didnt end up finishing HS because of the amount of weed he smoked
[2022-12-15 17:44:39] <%+TrickmasteH> that is not normal
[2022-12-15 17:44:55] <%+TrickmasteH> But yes, I will say it has a big impact on life if you don't make good decisions or have your head on your shouilders
[2022-12-15 17:44:59] <@%ragingqueen666> @polig then just do half a weed thing per walk or 1/3
[2022-12-15 17:45:00] <%polig> with weed*
[2022-12-15 17:45:00] <@%+strengthie> "uhhh" is every third word from those guys I know
[2022-12-15 17:45:17] <@%ragingqueen666> you dont need a lot of weed to be relax Shrug
[2022-12-15 17:45:22] <%Jimotthy> Which is why I say it depends on having an addictive personality and the people you surround yourself with
[2022-12-15 17:45:22] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-15 17:45:33] <%polig> @ragingqueen666 now ill just be walking around with 2/3 of a blunt in my pockets sinking up the place xD
