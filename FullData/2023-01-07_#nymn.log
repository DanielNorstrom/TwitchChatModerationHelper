[2023-01-07 01:18:10] <@%^botbear1110> Fawcan,  The .* in regex is a wildcard character that matches any character (except for line terminators). It is used to match any character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
[2023-01-07 01:18:15] <@%HBear___> also matches nothing

[2023-01-07 02:09:47] <@%OlleeW> all variants are taken
[2023-01-07 02:09:48] <@%^botbear1110> Backous,  OTK_Turbean likely covered up sexual assault in order to protect the reputation of the organization or individual involved. They may have also wanted to avoid any legal repercussions or public backlash.

[2023-01-07 12:49:56] <@%^botbear1110> fffffff4,  PastorZulul was removed from BTTV due to a violation of the platform's terms of service. The exact violation is unknown, but it is likely related to the content of his streams.

[2023-01-07 13:06:23] <@%^botbear1110> Sheikh_Djib0uti,  It is not recommended to store excess urine in your scrotum. If you have done so, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Urine stored in the scrotum can cause infection and other health complications.
[2023-01-07 13:06:53] <Sheikh_Djib0uti> well fuck

[2023-01-07 14:48:18] <@%^botbear1110> CheyFun,  Nutritionally, beef and chicken are both good sources of protein, but beef is higher in saturated fat and cholesterol than chicken. Beef is also higher in iron, zinc, and B vitamins than chicken. Chicken is lower in calories and fat than beef, and is a good source of niacin and vitamin B6.

Black pepper is made from unripe peppercorns that are cooked and dried, while white pepper is made from ripe peppercorns that are soaked in water and then dried. Black pepper has a stronger, more pungent flavor than white pepper, which has a milder, more subtle flavor. Black pepper is

Each of these plants has its own unique flavor and texture, so it's important to choose the one that best suits your tastes.
