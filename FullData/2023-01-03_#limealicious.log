[2023-01-03 22:42:34] <TheHylianGuard> I was hoping to experience the game for the first time with the remake
[2023-01-03 22:42:36] <%Somazure> they've said all the things that people expect will happen will happen, just they may not turn out the same way
[2023-01-03 22:42:39] <TastySammiches> nah people definitely wanted a big from-the-ground-up remake
[2023-01-03 22:42:41] <TheHylianGuard> I ended up being very lost and confused
[2023-01-03 22:42:44] <!%Laimubot> save the ballistics comment makes sense to fuse the most fucked up
[2023-01-03 22:42:47] <Davontrayt> Yeah, they probably just create a time paradox?
[2023-01-03 22:42:48] <%Charronia> It's always a clash between preserving the old and adding something new
[2023-01-03 22:42:52] <%$E_pam> give me a FF7 that looks like FF8
[2023-01-03 22:42:55] <%RocketOcelot> yeah, people were begging for nearly 2 decades for the original with a facelift and a few minor spelling fixes, but nooooooo
[2023-01-03 22:42:56] <TastySammiches> ever since that ff7 intro teaser on ps3 people have wanted a big budget remake
[2023-01-03 22:42:58] <$Megastar64> Just run Crisis Core into an emulator with upscaling, same thing. Kappa
[2023-01-03 22:42:58] <%donn_is_me> here's the thing honestly: ignore the ghosts and it's still like 90% a remake
[2023-01-03 22:42:59] <%RebeccaHeegaard> Part of the reason is that they didn't want to just retell the same story, which I get. Let the creative people be creative limesOk
[2023-01-03 22:43:05] <%donn_is_me> just… the ghosts limesO
[2023-01-03 22:43:05] <%Coocnat> Prettier, and better translated.
[2023-01-03 22:43:05] <%giromatt> we get that as a phone game apparently
[2023-01-03 22:43:07] <+RaZor92P> the new story has enough of the original plot beats while still doing something different to keep me guessing so I don't mind at all
[2023-01-03 22:43:09] <%+ritter_kasch> A pretty version on mobile that played smoothly would be 100% worth $20 to me.
[2023-01-03 22:43:18] <%czzm275> I like the remake's story as its own thing

[2023-01-03 22:43:29] <papitadelsur> @RebeccaHeegaard true but when money is on the way its really hard

[2023-01-03 23:54:20] <%+MaddoScientist0> it's because genesis denesis told him

[2023-01-03 23:54:23] <+Mithos56> He thought his mother was some lady named Jenova, not a monster named Jenova
