[2022-12-07 04:41:32] <@%$cogbro21> haven't bugged Attera to run any yet
[2022-12-07 04:42:02] <Reganayzer> Darktide and Vermintide is a funny melee slasher. But they definitely would seem boring for many people.

[2022-12-07 04:45:49] <%jaxin75> isn't a big problem in the division that enemies become bullet sponges later in the game?

[2022-12-07 04:46:44] <!%$Burnty__> @cogbro21 With how many people really enjoy DMZ I'm sure future versions will be a lot more flushed out, the fact it still calls itself a beta makes sense why its pretty bare right now
