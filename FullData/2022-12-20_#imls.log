[2022-12-20 19:17:57] <kimrin__> blue side has higher winrate, so they made red side have MMR to compensate. but higher MMR on your team means you get less LP per win

[2022-12-20 21:47:39] <%legendarypoey> @DyingLight2002 champions that are kiting you usually dont have cc
[2022-12-20 21:47:45] <SandorTheMandor> Heartsteel + titanic + guinsoo is not bad on Vayne but Toplane. W is already such a supit amount of damage and titanic gives AD with HP which HS ends up giving quite a lot. It's kiiinda similar to Tank Kog Build

[2022-12-20 21:48:49] <DyingLight2002> @DyingLight2002 I guess that's true if you are talking about ranged characters, but some melee kite by mixing in cc. Also if you are in a teamfight you will be cced anyway.
[2022-12-20 21:48:52] <tensai_lol> @Afrikayo damn
[2022-12-20 21:48:58] <MrSabroso> MS can save your life if it allows you to dodge extra stuff or space better, but it can also be entirely useless. it 100% depends on the situation.

[2022-12-20 21:52:09] <MrSabroso> obviously it depends on the champion. Garen getting an extra 10 MS is massive, while for Xerath it barley matters

[2022-12-20 21:52:51] <Nomagestus> MS seems to just "feel" good for a lot of people. Without it actually mattering in almost any situation
[2022-12-20 21:52:51] <%JDLoL> people just cite winrate shifts following random movement speed buffs and feel that justifies the stat being turbo significant without any explanation as to why
[2022-12-20 21:52:55] <%legendarypoey> @Jarcino_ you dont go magical for ms its to accelerate your build

[2022-12-20 21:54:46] <MrSabroso> I think 10 MS on many toplaners is big though. I remember Pantheon losing 10 MS at some point and it massively changed many ranged matchups in toplane.
[2022-12-20 21:55:05] <%+Jarcino_> yeah but if it was only for the gold then people would just sell the boots like a yuumi main

[2022-12-20 22:23:24] <MrSabroso> my cheat for feeling better is to eat more fiber (ideally from fresh vegetables obviously, but supplements or stuff like flea seeds also work). and to reduce your sugar intake. not calories, but sugar in particular
[2022-12-20 22:23:31] <Bersarke> like getting to a level of korean where you can do more than basic stuff
[2022-12-20 22:23:37] <%ProfeAndresX> Are there many english-korean schools there? To learn the language
[2022-12-20 22:23:37] <+Swervytv> for us older people how do you think we should go about learning a new language like i am 27 and wanna learn japanese

[2022-12-20 22:27:21] <PyroRage> i thought aery does more dmg if you procc it multiple times
[2022-12-20 22:27:21] <+Spitchyy> because you want to do less damage
[2022-12-20 22:27:21] <LiOzzie> comet feels good
[2022-12-20 22:27:26] <+flokerlol> i think rank 1 euw malz went aery at the time
[2022-12-20 22:27:26] <+OhhDewey> because it looks cool :)

[2022-12-20 22:27:35] <MisterAmbiguous> you can get an adapter that allows you to use bluetooth on cars that don't have bluetooth for like $10, surely that's cheaper than buying every album you like lol
[2022-12-20 22:27:35] <Kowhno> because aery is based off yuumi and yuum is cringe?
[2022-12-20 22:27:38] <+Swervytv> @exaltedxyz like i have been watching anime since i was young so i know keyword and what they mean but i need to actually learn the language
[2022-12-20 22:27:39] <jptmdark> @lol_ilterendi I was blind now i see PepeLaugh

[2022-12-20 22:28:12] <+TXBlaze> @lol_ilterendi oh yeah im probably thinking record
[2022-12-20 22:28:13] <PyroRage> ok makes sense
[2022-12-20 22:28:14] <jackymicah> aery doesnt deal that much dmg, its better for shield supports
[2022-12-20 22:28:19] <exaltedxyz> @Swervytv it explains everything about language learning and breaks down most misconceptions
[2022-12-20 22:28:33] <UltraViolet_lol> lethal range acquired

[2022-12-20 22:29:48] <exaltedxyz> @Swervytv but if u are only learning cuz of anime its better not to do it, speaking from experience + ever since the corona started it gained massive audience meaning the target audience switches to normies meaning its just cringe
