[2023-01-03 11:43:17] <%+bebex001_> freezing pipes aren't really a problem except when your houses are badly isolated and it is like -15 degrees outside
[2023-01-03 11:43:18] <puddinfreeky> my dad is a plummer and he always says dont close 100% but like you said to low setting etc. Its not good for the pipes:)
[2023-01-03 11:43:19] <!%Mikeverv> @Vaatraeva Little bit of freezing aint bad because the pressure keeps it from freezing the water right?
[2023-01-03 11:43:26] <ruffles___> slpyDank
[2023-01-03 11:43:45] <%kaiber666> Yeah for like tap and stuff

[2023-01-03 11:43:59] <+Erreb88> @EzPuaez The pipes does not expand, its the water that expands when freezing causing damage to the pipes.
[2023-01-03 11:44:18] <JuzZisAnAlien> you can just cut the water at the enter of the house/appartement and you open the tap ; so u purge all the pressured water inside your pipes
[2023-01-03 11:44:31] <Vaatraeva> @mikeverv Somewhat true
[2023-01-03 11:44:37] <kazmau> @kragiee Do you know a player named Lemecia? Hes my friend whos top 100 torb one trick using controller only on pc
[2023-01-03 11:44:38] <JuzZisAnAlien> then u can cut of the heater
[2023-01-03 11:44:50] <+Erreb88> @Mikeverv freezing is bad, but worse if the water aint moving ofc since it will freeze faster.
[2023-01-03 11:45:04] <%+bebex001_> the issue with freezing pipes is that the pressure that builds up because the water wants to freeze but can't expand in the pipes so it stays at just above freezing temperature till the pipes can't hold the pressure anymore. and it explodes when it goes too far

[2023-01-03 13:44:57] <Rosshizzle> How do people find the Battlepass? Personally not a fan of how needing to play 1 game everyday starts to feel more of an obligation/chore but the constant progression is nice.

[2023-01-03 17:13:44] <brianm1996> u can literally just run some type of heat behind the mirror and it wont fog
[2023-01-03 17:13:54] <fatracooncat> However, by far the easiest (and cheapest) method is to use a polycarbonate mirror with a hydrophilic layer applied, which will encourage the water to form a very fine film instead of forming droplets and fog.
