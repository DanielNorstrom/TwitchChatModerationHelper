[2022-12-23 00:37:58] <ZeroPointGames> @Waaghbafet with these kinds of 'hardcore' pvp games, you have to accept at first you aren't 'good' and have a lack of basic knowledge. like in tarkov noobs are like "i keep dying out of nowhere" but really they are making mistakes that get them killed

[2022-12-23 00:44:02] <+TwZteDSoLDieR> @ZeroPointGames i dont agree fully, when i started tarkov, i had a buddy who knew the game, that showed me the basics, i didnt lean on him to get gear, learned what was good and what wasnt, so a buddy who knows the game that teaches you the basics not only helps , but makes you more likely to be successful as a solo in the end, when your a solo in  a game that runs 3 mans more than solos you cant win. i didnt run into a single solo player when i played this game. i like this game just really rea

[2022-12-23 01:43:06] <%ForsaikenRedskye> Tarkov is a hardcore shooter where as Battlebit is geared towards more casual players

[2022-12-23 01:44:39] <+Jkiest9> not rly, cause battlefield is more or less a better shooter than tarkov
[2022-12-23 01:44:44] <+Jkiest9> cause tarkov barely functions half the time
