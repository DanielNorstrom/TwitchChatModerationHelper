[2022-12-10 07:15:16] <!Kyyuna> similar
[2022-12-10 07:16:01] <!Kyyuna> most american joints will just use american cheese due to it melty texture, but some places will use swiss, pepperjack, etc

[2022-12-10 07:17:22] <@%StreamFollower> Depends on where you go. Fast food places tend to use American cheese, but local places usually actually use cheddar and shit.
[2022-12-10 07:17:33] <!Kyyuna> ya it really just depends on the place
[2022-12-10 07:17:36] <@%StreamFollower> So just support local business, not fast food. lol

[2022-12-10 09:59:12] <@%hatduck_> no other game goes up my ass except that
[2022-12-10 09:59:17] <!%Trangar> My ass is committed to factorio
[2022-12-10 09:59:31] <@%$Durminon> That game is worse. Right now it just is straight up unfair

[2022-12-10 09:59:37] <%Nutzzz96> hatduck has a faithful ass DankNoted
[2022-12-10 09:59:40] <!%kmzia> is satisfactory good?
[2022-12-10 09:59:45] <@%StreamFollower> I refunded Ixion just now.
[2022-12-10 09:59:46] <!%Trangar> Ye
[2022-12-10 09:59:56] <@%StreamFollower> The permanent hull degradation after each VOHLE jump is brutal.
[2022-12-10 10:00:08] <@%^Nightbot> Find out more about Path of Exile: The Forbidden Sanctum at  www.pathofexile.com/sanctum
[2022-12-10 10:00:09] <@%StreamFollower> I'm sure if I were better at those kind of games I could get around it, but oof.
[2022-12-10 10:00:14] <!%Trangar> Satisfactory is very pretty, and not as hardcore committal as factorio is
[2022-12-10 10:00:23] <@%$Durminon> yeah, it is stupid. But the worse things are the accidents
[2022-12-10 10:00:25] <!%kmzia> @Durminon did you play KIngdom reborn?
[2022-12-10 10:00:27] <@%StreamFollower> I greatly prefer Satisfactory since resources are unlimited at each node.
[2022-12-10 10:00:31] <@%$Durminon> @kmzia no
[2022-12-10 10:00:43] <@%StreamFollower> I didn't see much issue with the accidents.
[2022-12-10 10:00:59] <@%StreamFollower> I was micro-managing population though.
[2022-12-10 10:01:06] <@%^Nightbot> Check out darktide here! - https://i.try.games/darktide/loasg5
[2022-12-10 10:01:08] <@%StreamFollower> Making sure everything was always optimal working conditions.
[2022-12-10 10:01:18] <@%$Durminon> Onces one accident slipped, everything went downhill
[2022-12-10 10:01:43] <@%$Durminon> and fucking space weather
[2022-12-10 10:01:44] <@%$Durminon> why
[2022-12-10 10:01:52] <@%StreamFollower> Eh, I just turned buildings off until everyone got out of the hospital.
[2022-12-10 10:01:54] <!%Trangar> There are hills in space? Thinkge
[2022-12-10 10:02:08] <@%StreamFollower> Then slowly turned them back on as I could to keep work conditions optimal.
[2022-12-10 10:02:23] <@%StreamFollower> The hull repairs though.
[2022-12-10 10:02:25] <@%StreamFollower> My goodness.
[2022-12-10 10:02:34] <@%StreamFollower> Hoovering my alloy up like crazy.
[2022-12-10 10:02:35] <@%$Durminon> Did you play chapter 2 at all?
[2022-12-10 10:02:49] <@%StreamFollower> A little, I dipped when I saw the VOHLE jump degradation stacked.
[2022-12-10 10:02:55] <@%$Durminon> what alloy? I never got my stock back up
[2022-12-10 10:03:00] <@%StreamFollower> With seemingly no way to repair it.
[2022-12-10 10:03:08] <@%StreamFollower> I had a nice stockpile since I was mining the crap out of asteroids.
[2022-12-10 10:03:38] <@%StreamFollower> You just move the main station near an asteroid so the turnaround time is short.
[2022-12-10 10:03:40] <@%$Durminon> I tried to get the 2nd chapter to work, but you can't fuck up your research or be to slow.
[2022-12-10 10:04:09] <@%$Durminon> You get up to a -4 debuff in the second mission. fucking sucks
[2022-12-10 10:04:43] <@%StreamFollower> Yeah, I didn't like Frostpunk because it basically felt like a puzzle game, and this was a puzzle game in space because of the constant hull degradation.
[2022-12-10 10:04:59] <@%hatduck_> frostpunk is good okey
[2022-12-10 10:05:04] <@%$Durminon> but frostpunk was fair and had a difficulty setting
[2022-12-10 10:05:04] <Vincanthofred> ur good
[2022-12-10 10:05:06] <@%StreamFollower> Then you might like Ixion.

[2022-12-10 10:05:23] <@%$Durminon> ixion just wants you to bend over

[2022-12-10 10:05:31] <@%StreamFollower> I just can't stand games with a hard time limit.
[2022-12-10 10:05:42] <@%$Durminon> yeah, give me time in my games
[2022-12-10 10:05:45] <@%hatduck_> that scenario was so hard

As I tried hard to juke him into the woods, he hit me from the back a few times and kept chasing me, I could tell he was getting really excited. His teammate support came out of nowhere and stole the kill, but as I died I still had enough enough time to grab onto his manhood and scream my last words: CS  LUL

[2022-12-10 13:51:54] <@%StreamFollower> @Jin_Kamisama What was he playing every day? Because if he's playing certain things, he should just be warned to not do it. No reason to be suspended or banned over something so silly.
[2022-12-10 13:51:55] <%光復香港_時代革命 (pridekappa)> @Darth_Pantsu well PepeLaf platform wont know who actually own the music or u are the creator or not PepeLaf they heard copyrighted shit they just ban
[2022-12-10 13:51:55] <avrovski> @BenjyyX DMCA is not an idea from twitch i belive. Its from the music label.
[2022-12-10 13:51:56] <Dot0nigiri> A lot vtuber from hololive get dmca from their own original songs
[2022-12-10 13:51:57] <%$Fluffz_86> is he sole owner of it though?

[2022-12-10 13:52:40] <!%BenjyyX> @avrovski It's not about that tho. I am talking about the fact that they don't communicate anything. Sometimes you don't know the reason you got banned/striked, DMCA reasoning or else
[2022-12-10 13:52:41] <%Christmas_Fighters> chat. artists are not the owner of the copyright if they sell them lol

As I tried hard to juke him into the woods, he hit me from the back a few times and kept chasing me, I could tell he was getting really excited. His teammate support came out of nowhere and stole the kill, but as I died I still had enough enough time to grab onto his manhood and scream my last words: CS  LUL

[2022-12-10 14:54:52] <%Defahgo> They nerfed summon for like a year or two :D
[2022-12-10 14:54:52] <LeDucViet95> yeah, they move a lot of power from gem to item, so summon is weaker without item.
[2022-12-10 14:54:55] <%+rob_the_glob> summons are hard to keep alive in late maps

[2022-12-10 14:55:22] <+Bloody_Orchid> @seustia hardcore is if you dies once you go to softcore
[2022-12-10 14:55:37] <%Defahgo> I think focus on dmg for now. You can worry about res after Act V
[2022-12-10 14:55:46] <%ihssoy> unless it's in a league, then you get dropped to perm sc @9d1w

[2022-12-10 15:02:51] <@%StreamFollower> @zapman00 Sing just said you can do 80% of the content even if you do whatever build wise. You can pretty much full clear the campaign, essentially. If you want to see the ultra uber end game stuff, you'd need to do more.

[2022-12-10 15:03:27] <bypes2a> yea I think that's fair. Impossible to make every build as strong, but if I can do whatever I want for 80% of the game, it is fine as a casual gaymer

[2022-12-10 15:05:09] <%ihssoy> @seustia every league has a special mechanic attached to it that plays differently (most of the times). This league has a rogue-like "dungeon"-esque map that you choose paths to go through
[2022-12-10 15:05:12] <%Esstand> everything works if you put enough money into it
[2022-12-10 15:05:15] <Gonroy_> are you using some sort of loot filter or is this the defaultone

[2022-12-10 17:21:11] <Vincanthofred> yeah because sometimes you don't have the stats to get the level up
[2022-12-10 17:21:16] <Vincanthofred> and the level requirement
[2022-12-10 17:21:18] <uzuisan> or mana issues
[2022-12-10 17:21:21] <iMeany> @SpaceWashingMachine you might want to leave some for lower levels for lower mana consumption/cd or something

[2022-12-10 17:41:42] <B1od> phys immune is very rare, almost exclusive to expedition
[2022-12-10 17:41:43] <Physaciathz> tbh I expected sing to freaking dies from opening a stronghold boxes which included a mob with bloodline mods that trigger all the spells in the world within the screen to instantly kill sing LUL
[2022-12-10 17:41:47] <+fractal_shadow> expedition can be hard BUT it is very rewarding
