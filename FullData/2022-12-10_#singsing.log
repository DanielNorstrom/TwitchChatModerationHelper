[2022-12-10 07:15:16] <!Kyyuna> similar
[2022-12-10 07:16:01] <!Kyyuna> most american joints will just use american cheese due to it melty texture, but some places will use swiss, pepperjack, etc

[2022-12-10 07:17:22] <@%StreamFollower> Depends on where you go. Fast food places tend to use American cheese, but local places usually actually use cheddar and shit.
[2022-12-10 07:17:33] <!Kyyuna> ya it really just depends on the place
[2022-12-10 07:17:36] <@%StreamFollower> So just support local business, not fast food. lol

[2022-12-10 09:59:08] <@%$Durminon> no playing with feelings!
[2022-12-10 09:59:12] <@%hatduck_> no other game goes up my ass except that
[2022-12-10 09:59:17] <!%Trangar> My ass is committed to factorio
[2022-12-10 09:59:31] <@%$Durminon> That game is worse. Right now it just is straight up unfair

[2022-12-10 09:59:37] <%Nutzzz96> hatduck has a faithful ass DankNoted
[2022-12-10 09:59:40] <!%kmzia> is satisfactory good?
[2022-12-10 09:59:45] <@%StreamFollower> I refunded Ixion just now.
[2022-12-10 09:59:46] <!%Trangar> Ye
[2022-12-10 09:59:56] <@%StreamFollower> The permanent hull degradation after each VOHLE jump is brutal.
[2022-12-10 10:00:08] <@%^Nightbot> Find out more about Path of Exile: The Forbidden Sanctum at  www.pathofexile.com/sanctum
[2022-12-10 10:00:09] <@%StreamFollower> I'm sure if I were better at those kind of games I could get around it, but oof.
[2022-12-10 10:00:14] <!%Trangar> Satisfactory is very pretty, and not as hardcore committal as factorio is
[2022-12-10 10:00:23] <@%$Durminon> yeah, it is stupid. But the worse things are the accidents
[2022-12-10 10:00:25] <!%kmzia> @Durminon did you play KIngdom reborn?
[2022-12-10 10:00:27] <@%StreamFollower> I greatly prefer Satisfactory since resources are unlimited at each node.
[2022-12-10 10:00:31] <@%$Durminon> @kmzia no
[2022-12-10 10:00:43] <@%StreamFollower> I didn't see much issue with the accidents.
[2022-12-10 10:00:59] <@%StreamFollower> I was micro-managing population though.
[2022-12-10 10:01:06] <@%^Nightbot> Check out darktide here! - https://i.try.games/darktide/loasg5
[2022-12-10 10:01:08] <@%StreamFollower> Making sure everything was always optimal working conditions.
[2022-12-10 10:01:18] <@%$Durminon> Onces one accident slipped, everything went downhill
[2022-12-10 10:01:43] <@%$Durminon> and fucking space weather
[2022-12-10 10:01:44] <@%$Durminon> why
[2022-12-10 10:01:52] <@%StreamFollower> Eh, I just turned buildings off until everyone got out of the hospital.
[2022-12-10 10:01:54] <!%Trangar> There are hills in space? Thinkge
[2022-12-10 10:02:08] <@%StreamFollower> Then slowly turned them back on as I could to keep work conditions optimal.
[2022-12-10 10:02:23] <@%StreamFollower> The hull repairs though.
[2022-12-10 10:02:25] <@%StreamFollower> My goodness.
[2022-12-10 10:02:34] <@%StreamFollower> Hoovering my alloy up like crazy.
[2022-12-10 10:02:35] <@%$Durminon> Did you play chapter 2 at all?
[2022-12-10 10:02:49] <@%StreamFollower> A little, I dipped when I saw the VOHLE jump degradation stacked.
[2022-12-10 10:02:55] <@%$Durminon> what alloy? I never got my stock back up
[2022-12-10 10:03:00] <@%StreamFollower> With seemingly no way to repair it.
[2022-12-10 10:03:08] <@%StreamFollower> I had a nice stockpile since I was mining the crap out of asteroids.
[2022-12-10 10:03:38] <@%StreamFollower> You just move the main station near an asteroid so the turnaround time is short.
[2022-12-10 10:03:40] <@%$Durminon> I tried to get the 2nd chapter to work, but you can't fuck up your research or be to slow.
[2022-12-10 10:04:09] <@%$Durminon> You get up to a -4 debuff in the second mission. fucking sucks
[2022-12-10 10:04:43] <@%StreamFollower> Yeah, I didn't like Frostpunk because it basically felt like a puzzle game, and this was a puzzle game in space because of the constant hull degradation.
[2022-12-10 10:04:59] <@%hatduck_> frostpunk is good okey
[2022-12-10 10:05:04] <@%$Durminon> but frostpunk was fair and had a difficulty setting
[2022-12-10 10:05:04] <Vincanthofred> ur good
[2022-12-10 10:05:06] <@%StreamFollower> Then you might like Ixion.

[2022-12-10 10:05:23] <@%$Durminon> ixion just wants you to bend over

[2022-12-10 10:05:31] <@%StreamFollower> I just can't stand games with a hard time limit.
[2022-12-10 10:05:42] <@%$Durminon> yeah, give me time in my games
[2022-12-10 10:05:45] <@%hatduck_> that scenario was so hard

[2022-12-10 11:34:57] <Aush0j> Why is Sing so hot and manly? I have wet dreams with him every night. Yesterday I dreamed I was a ranged creep and Sing was trying to last hit me. As I tried hard to juke him into the woods, he hit me from the back a few times and kept chasing me, I could tell he was getting really excited. His teammate support came out of nowhere and stole the kill, but as I died I still had enough enough time to grab onto his manhood and scream my last words: CS  LUL

[2022-12-10 14:01:41] <Aush0j> Why is Sing so hot and manly? I have wet dreams with him every night. Yesterday I dreamed I was a ranged creep and Sing was trying to last hit me. As I tried hard to juke him into the woods, he hit me from the back a few times and kept chasing me, I could tell he was getting really excited. His teammate support came out of nowhere and stole the kill, but as I died I still had enough enough time to grab onto his manhood and scream my last words: CS  LUL

[2022-12-10 14:54:52] <LeDucViet95> yeah, they move a lot of power from gem to item, so summon is weaker without item.

[2022-12-10 15:02:13] <zapman00> is this game friendly for beginners? I don't want to try there so many stuff to learn.

[2022-12-10 15:02:16] <%hirtza1> there is choice either you choose a good build or bad build
[2022-12-10 15:02:26] <EpicVertigo> FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-10 15:02:27] <%ihssoy> also that there's way more SC players so the availablity of items is higher @seustia

[2022-12-10 15:02:33] <%iblis144> Chat you can go white maps with pretty much any build

[2022-12-10 15:02:49] <%+Trajan_Hunter> sometimes the good enough builds are some of the most fun
[2022-12-10 15:02:49] <Pawley> i like summon since it give me friends Sadge
[2022-12-10 15:02:50] <%darkbiacksnow> you can copy a good build but if you're not having fun whats the point
[2022-12-10 15:02:51] <@%StreamFollower> @zapman00 Sing just said you can do 80% of the content even if you do whatever build wise. You can pretty much full clear the campaign, essentially. If you want to see the ultra uber end game stuff, you'd need to do more.
[2022-12-10 15:03:00] <%Defahgo> As long as you don't have 5 active skills I think you should be good :D
[2022-12-10 15:03:02] <%IndianoJonez> the build is fun and funny, does anything else matter? everyone has fun their own way anyway

[2022-12-10 15:03:15] <%Nekooooooooo> @zapman00 so, the game isn't friendly for beginners because there's a super detailed guide for it? Thinkge
[2022-12-10 15:03:16] <%Lucasmsu> Just try to have fun, and when you're not having fun anymore, uninstall

[2022-12-10 15:03:26] <%darkbiacksnow> just find a skill you think is fun then roll with it okey
[2022-12-10 15:03:27] <bypes2a> yea I think that's fair. Impossible to make every build as strong, but if I can do whatever I want for 80% of the game, it is fine as a casual gaymer
[2022-12-10 15:03:27] <%Defahgo> Oh is this the league mechanic?
[2022-12-10 15:03:37] <phamhung0230> game is for fun so just have fun
[2022-12-10 15:03:38] <%+Soph1s1icateDonkey> to do uber bosses you need some pretty sick gear
[2022-12-10 15:03:46] <LeDucViet95> but the league mechanic is so rough. :( i cannot go to the final chamber.

[2022-12-10 15:05:09] <%ihssoy> @seustia every league has a special mechanic attached to it that plays differently (most of the times). This league has a rogue-like "dungeon"-esque map that you choose paths to go through
[2022-12-10 15:05:12] <%Esstand> everything works if you put enough money into it
[2022-12-10 15:05:15] <Gonroy_> are you using some sort of loot filter or is this the defaultone

[2022-12-10 15:08:52] <Vincanthofred> @Nekooooooooo leagues are basically a season that you play and then it gets sent to standard at the end of the league (the leagues tend to have new experimental mechanics) this game is pretty much free , the only thing is stash tabs , which you don't need that many of

[2022-12-10 17:23:20] <%+SC2_DiaBoLuS> i do but it's just a problem in general. i can't just pick up a game and go in without knowledge. read 100 hours play 10 hours restart if missed something LUL

[2022-12-10 17:26:25] <grimacetv> @SpaceWashingMachine always id before selling
[2022-12-10 17:26:29] <Vincanthofred> when you id item you get alteration shards, if you don't ID, you get transmutation shards
[2022-12-10 17:26:34] <%goodboy_000> id and non-id item gives different loot
