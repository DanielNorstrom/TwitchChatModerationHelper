[2022-12-23 14:09:28] <+dMdCRolly> The word yuletide comes from Old Norse and means ‚Äúfeast of the yule.‚Äù In Scandinavia, the yule was a time to celebrate the winter solstice and the return of the sun. The yule was also a time for feasting, singing, and dancing. In England, the yule was a time to celebrate the birth of Christ.
