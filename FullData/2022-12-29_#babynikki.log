[2022-12-29 18:17:04] <psychoyetiTV> once you learn tap strafing bro you'll never say that again LOL
[2022-12-29 18:17:04] <+glavenus__> We have a Marufuku Ramen house not far from here
[2022-12-29 18:17:05] <@%Kevachino> wall bouncing and tap strafing are really just basic movement these days lets be real
[2022-12-29 18:17:08] <Designoc> Movement on roller is fun if u have paddles
[2022-12-29 18:17:13] <Lyserberg1> With the steam config bro, I got all the movement I need brah
[2022-12-29 18:17:14] <%+istoking> consistent slide jumps and timing
[2022-12-29 18:17:15] <tjbballin> to be honest i think mnk movement is more fluent
[2022-12-29 18:17:28] <@%Kevachino> not easy????
[2022-12-29 18:17:32] <Lyserberg1> But mnk movement is much slicker

[2022-12-29 18:18:05] <psychoyetiTV> I would say its vital on m&k to tap strafe. I now am working on hitting super glides every chance I get in game but I cant hit them every time I try

[2022-12-29 18:39:16] <%popR0X_> yea it was the best skin
[2022-12-29 18:39:16] <Powerbats> @Nosnhoj_Leahcim Old Nuketown zombies was the best
[2022-12-29 18:39:29] <%popR0X_> hope they refunded the people who bought it
[2022-12-29 18:39:47] <+profecy85> As a pretty new player, it really sucks landing in games where people have more wins than I have kills with all chars combined... Only for the jump master to hot drop, die, and quit. Hoping the rumored SBMM changes make it a bit more fair for trash players like myself. It's a really fun game, but so dang sweaty.
[2022-12-29 18:39:53] <%Nosnhoj_Leahcim> black ops 3 was the best in my opinion
[2022-12-29 18:40:08] <slowtempos> @popR0X_ you don't know Respawn ver ywell
[2022-12-29 18:40:25] <Lyserberg1> @powerbats it's good if people are staying relatively steady, but hardly the appropriate choice in that scenario. Damage dropoff over long distance though is an interesting suggestion. I know Warzone has a similar thing (though their TTK is much faster so it evens out)
[2022-12-29 18:40:25] <+Its_Hous> @profecy85 yea unranked is a tough place to play sometimes
[2022-12-29 18:40:25] <%popR0X_> @slowtempos im talking about cod btw
[2022-12-29 18:40:31] <%+Cluttzasaurus> @Kevachino i think that's what a couple of teams used as a reason.  liquid is the only one that makes sense though.  c9 and g2 pulled out because their roster's didn't qual for the LAN.  G2 actually offered chaotic to stay but when he chose to be a free agent, G2 decided to leave.

[2022-12-29 20:49:10] <iLoveItJay> Was nicer when it was in the crafter, felt you saw it less being played
[2022-12-29 20:49:10] <Waterfault> they need to reduce wingman base damage by 10
[2022-12-29 20:49:11] <%JustSteeb> 2 shots for 131 Jesus baby Kraber
[2022-12-29 20:49:17] <rokyon> broken moon is walking simulator
[2022-12-29 20:49:20] <charly5dc> yeah I hate broten moon as well
[2022-12-29 20:49:24] <%+Hectorshot116> id prefer KC, SP, and olympus
[2022-12-29 20:49:34] <LowKeyLuc> they should switch rotation for trios and duos so 2 out of 3 rotations you can play the map you want
[2022-12-29 20:49:36] <%+awesomeandrew30> Wingman is stronger than shotguns and snipers. In a class of its own for sure

[2022-12-29 20:50:13] <%Slowpear16> The wingman should only drop in pred lobbies

[2022-12-29 21:40:31] <%$mysterese> Fortnite just came out (like 5-6months now) with software that detects strike packs and shit
[2022-12-29 21:40:33] <duke_kurogami> @ishawtie Enjoy!!!!!
[2022-12-29 21:40:45] <+ragectl> it's because it's hard to detect on a controller beyond a certain point
[2022-12-29 21:40:49] <%PosAjdin> back in my day, rapid fire mods got you banned off GBs
[2022-12-29 21:40:49] <%Old_Sport_Tv> smalldickenergy
[2022-12-29 21:40:53] <@%Kevachino> no well because its not game software, its self contained and alters your controller inputs acieYEP
