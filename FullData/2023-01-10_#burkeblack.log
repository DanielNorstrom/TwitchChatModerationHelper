[2023-01-10 08:26:25] <mahoraz> @britedog yup... but that was the point, that just inhaling air gives you more radiation than flying by airplane (youd have to fly from east coast to west coast 8 times a year to even the numbers you get from inhaling air for same time period)

[2023-01-10 08:49:57] <%Varanid> his sacrfice was important but damn what a loss
[2023-01-10 08:49:58] <razerfreak3> thats the beauty of 40k
[2023-01-10 08:50:07] <%britedog> if games don't have lore they are meh

[2023-01-10 08:50:18] <+chobtt> @AshLike btw im saying Primarchs because he was one out of 22 primarchs.
[2023-01-10 08:50:18] <PKM4STER> he's a good character NODDERS
[2023-01-10 08:50:21] <%inquisit0r001> @Nickkolas huh i mustve missed that
[2023-01-10 08:50:21] <%+prfella> @Davemented the difference is LOTR was made as a blockbuster epic trilogy of 3 movies..the warhammer 40k thing we are talking about is going to be a series on Amazon prime, a bit different stakes I'd say
[2023-01-10 08:50:29] <+AshLike> Was the Emperor good or bad? also, is the notion of good or bad even apply in such a grey area
[2023-01-10 08:50:41] <%britedog> that was the thing i saw when i joined in
[2023-01-10 08:50:48] <%Varanid> like walking behind a bulldog ...

[2023-01-10 08:51:16] <%inquisit0r001> @blazrath92 the guy who played bishop in xmen
[2023-01-10 08:51:17] <razerfreak3> emporer is shady. to say the least XD
[2023-01-10 08:51:18] <%Varanid> @blazrath92 surely Idris alba?
[2023-01-10 08:51:20] <LittleBigSad> I thought this game was about zombies? monkaHmm
[2023-01-10 08:51:29] <macrofusion> He did tell a few things to his sons.
[2023-01-10 08:51:34] <+chobtt> @BurkeBlack dude you are still at the first book still? and that's like at halfway.
[2023-01-10 08:51:34] <%+Thurzy> Erebus had something to do with sharing the knowledge
[2023-01-10 08:51:35] <%+Nickkolas> @BurkeBlack he tried to keep it vague
[2023-01-10 08:51:40] <razerfreak3> all we know is that the warp grew stronger and stronger since the emporer took over human kind
[2023-01-10 08:51:48] <+TyrGrimnir> He is checking for zombies in the trees, he is a tree inspector
[2023-01-10 08:51:49] <+AshLike> so it seems the emperor treats the m like simple pawns
[2023-01-10 08:51:49] <macrofusion> Alpharius and Omegon were told something about the warp
[2023-01-10 08:51:52] <%britedog> why is he called horus?
[2023-01-10 08:51:55] <%Varanid> Cilian Murphy for Eisenhorn
[2023-01-10 08:51:59] <macrofusion> The Lion were told the most.

[2023-01-10 08:54:16] <macrofusion> I couldn't get through Fulgrim's novel.
[2023-01-10 08:54:19] <macrofusion> I read halfway and stopped.
[2023-01-10 08:54:26] <macrofusion> It is just awful to me
[2023-01-10 08:54:35] <%britedog> wait res steve jobs as horus
[2023-01-10 08:54:43] <%+Nickkolas> I just started some of the ork ones. They're funny.
[2023-01-10 08:54:44] <razerfreak3> lore is 40k is always weird. its always a person writing about the lore so it will always be influenced by opinion and agenda. its difficult to figure out whats right and whats wrong. thats why the emporer is to this day such a mysterious persona
[2023-01-10 08:54:46] <macrofusion> If I read another word of "perfection"...
[2023-01-10 08:54:46] <supposeppo80> @macrofusion they just could not control their emotion and had daddy issuwes should been better but yea
[2023-01-10 08:55:24] <%britedog> *thinks*
[2023-01-10 08:55:28] <macrofusion> Yeah, all of them have daddy issues. Emperor influenced them in all kinds of ways.
[2023-01-10 08:55:47] <%britedog> if you are a good writer you don't let personal opinion change the lore to your tastes

[2023-01-10 08:56:24] <morkelebmink> my favorite 40k book serie sis Cyphus Cain, HERO of the imperium
[2023-01-10 08:56:36] <macrofusion> @britedog bad writers like the one who came up with Space Marine multi-lasers.
[2023-01-10 08:56:37] <+thatdudejohn62> 40k lore depends who writes it hence why the ultra marines are always center of attention not that I am complaining
[2023-01-10 08:56:39] <morkelebmink> best commisar ever
[2023-01-10 08:56:46] <supposeppo80> @morkelebmink i hace that and im reading dark angel omnibus

[2023-01-10 08:57:06] <%+Nickkolas> @BurkeBlack The horus heresy was too big. I went with Dan Abnett's stuff- Gaunt's Ghosts, Eishenhorn, Ravenor.
[2023-01-10 08:57:08] <EclecticSoundwaveSophist> needs more nades.
[2023-01-10 08:57:34] <macrofusion> Oh, oh, one will never get through 40K lore.
[2023-01-10 08:57:40] <%+Thurzy> Anything by Aaron Dembski-Bowden nand Dan Abnett are always good
[2023-01-10 08:57:40] <%britedog> k will do
[2023-01-10 08:57:42] <+YaBoiii> Eisenhorn is my favorite book. Just too good.
[2023-01-10 08:57:44] <razerfreak3> @macrofusion yep thats the intend
[2023-01-10 08:57:46] <macrofusion> Most blokes only know the Imperial stuff.

[2023-01-10 11:17:08] <+Angry_Viking> It looks like iron
[2023-01-10 11:17:17] <bustinpnutz> looks like iron i think
[2023-01-10 11:17:43] <bustinpnutz> yup
[2023-01-10 11:17:49] <%+Angry_Viking> Yes
[2023-01-10 11:18:02] <+Dduderay> Console updates are never happening unfortunately. I played all the time on PlayStation with my friends so I wish they would update it but there was that whole thing where Telltale Games went bankrupt and they were the publisher for the console version so after that the devs tried getting the licensing for console but they couldnt or something and by the time they got it, it wasnt even worth updating the game at that point and especially at this point they are so far ahead on the pc version
[2023-01-10 11:18:02] <bustinpnutz> nope
[2023-01-10 11:18:03] <%rubberdubdub101> maybe its like gold/dimond
