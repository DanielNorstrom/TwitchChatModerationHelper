[2022-12-29 00:29:02] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> OBS you can just sit on an old OBS version forever, Streamlabs Desktop you cannot
[2022-12-29 00:29:40] <%+xxderpydashxx> dam now u got two guns fancy
[2022-12-29 00:29:42] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> anything you find related to OBS, may not work for Streamlabs Desktop, even if they are VERY similar programs, if you are looking things up, please remember that
[2022-12-29 00:30:43] <%Diiiiiing> While I am oft loathe to play Tarky, fucking about in my inventory does scratch the OCD itch :o

[2022-12-29 00:31:35] <%Diiiiiing> Thank you @OverEzEggs. While I might not make it beyond Lvl 5, I will have the most organized inventory in all Tarkov.
[2022-12-29 00:32:12] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> also, I am actually LOOKING at the log file now, before I was just using OBS log analyzer, and I am seeing that it KNOWS it looses connection with the server

[2022-12-29 00:46:24] <%Jaccquee> def would recommend looking up a map for woods

[2022-12-29 00:48:25] <%Jaccquee> yeah, you can also do offline raids to learn the map and loot spots too
[2022-12-29 00:48:44] <%deputyimasian> SoT is buggy still, i enjoy it but the desync makes it unplayable
[2022-12-29 00:48:47] <%Jaccquee> would recommend that on your first run
[2022-12-29 00:48:50] <%Diiiiiing> There are maps for sale by Therapist and sometimes by Fence, but expensive. Not worth the Rubs. There are resources on the web with maps that you can have up on a second screen.

[2022-12-29 06:28:55] <%Jaccquee> we can tell when stuff is wet, but the basis on which we decipher it can occur with different conditions, so therefore we don't specifically feel that something is wet
