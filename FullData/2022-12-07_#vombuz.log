[2022-12-07 17:47:56] <$sethyboi01> I think at the bare minimum you shouldn't earn xp or hunt dollars if you extract without bounty
[2022-12-07 17:47:57] <%$Nithiria11> only bounty extract and after they extract you can extract too
[2022-12-07 17:47:58] <Heymelon> I disagree, at least until they create a way to get bars back in game. Burned bars as solo I just wanna extract man :P

[2022-12-07 17:49:09] <Heymelon> Haha, solo full bars is bad enough.  But I'd want to get bars back in teams as well so there's that
[2022-12-07 17:49:36] <chonax_uy> theres any difference in chary or only the animation¬°
[2022-12-07 17:49:38] <chonax_uy> ?
[2022-12-07 17:50:00] VIEWERS: 563
[2022-12-07 17:50:05] <MazaJP> Exactly! And Bosses near the extraction should be impossible to happen
[2022-12-07 17:50:32] <MazaJP> like right next to it. That's just garbo
[2022-12-07 17:50:42] <Heymelon> Sure, let's say I play shotgun and  missing bars. And theres a long ammo team with full bars just camping.

[2022-12-07 17:51:29] <%Aevion_> Let's say you're the one playing long ammo vs a team that lost bars
[2022-12-07 17:51:29] <HSandstrom> Extraction near boss is great imo. Makes it so attackers have to hurry and not camp outside
[2022-12-07 17:51:36] <%Aevion_> It works both ways
[2022-12-07 17:52:00] VIEWERS: 511
[2022-12-07 17:52:05] <%Aevion_> If you lost a bar that's your fault and you should be punished by it having to fight with less health
[2022-12-07 17:52:48] <Heymelon> @Aevion_ That's a very booring incentive. You are punsished for being active and taking fights then, and the campers that do nothing have full bars.
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <$sethyboi01> I think the point vombuz is making is that any mechanics that discourage interaction should be reevaluated
[2022-12-07 17:53:35] <Heymelon> I agree that's how it should work. I think we want the same things just have some different solutiojns
[2022-12-07 17:53:52] <%+professor_phobos> maybe the guy driving the boat/carriage charges you $1000 for a non-bounty extraction
[2022-12-07 17:53:52] <HSandstrom> I think looting hunters should come with a choice. Loot and get gear/money OR loot and get a bar back.
[2022-12-07 17:53:54] <lidril> problem is there is no real objective
[2022-12-07 17:53:57] <lidril> you can do what you want

[2022-12-07 17:54:31] [Points] SkeDaddle75 redeemed a custom reward (unknown) [Very excited with new weapons on the way. I predict we will see the Spencer Carbine in HUNT eventually. Sadly no Mauser as its action is very similar to Mosin.]
[2022-12-07 17:54:36] <%Aevion_> We just want a better game experience vombuzSlam
[2022-12-07 17:54:46] <%+professor_phobos> i think the original design was more of a risk-reward sandbox than the action game they actually made, I doubt they'll change it now
[2022-12-07 17:54:59] <%+Ricloz420> All good :D
[2022-12-07 17:55:00] <$sethyboi01> The main thing is the economy needs to be reevaluated, currently it is too easy to earn hunt dollars which discourages bounty as objective
[2022-12-07 17:55:19] <$sethyboi01> If you did not earn hunt dollars unless you extracted with bounty it would completely change the economy and interactions of the game
[2022-12-07 17:55:37] <Heymelon> I've just been fighting a lot of long ammo teams exit camping and stuff which I guess is fair enough but I fight them with hurt bars often after killing teams and boss and they sat there i nothing :D
[2022-12-07 17:55:42] <%+professor_phobos> they should 100% remove extraction incentives though, like losing money from lucky registers, etc
[2022-12-07 17:55:55] <lidril> yea but people want to fight faster thats why they go for fight and gunshoots most of the time, maybe smaller map like 70% of this one could be better
[2022-12-07 17:55:56] <StepMastaFresh> I think one of the benefits of Hunt is that having extracts gives more options, im always a fan of having more options rather than less.

[2022-12-07 17:56:17] <+ramonamatona> these last patches killed prestiging with price raises, questlines,etc
[2022-12-07 17:56:20] <%+professor_phobos> there's a segment of the fanbase that would go nuts if the game became "less hardcore" and that blocks a lot of smart changes they could make

[2022-12-07 18:14:59] <TheRogueOverlord> If it was always a distance to extract you would know which compounds the boss was not at though
[2022-12-07 18:15:08] <tenetchurch> so do you try and disengage from random fights until youre at the boss lair or if there is just no other choice?
