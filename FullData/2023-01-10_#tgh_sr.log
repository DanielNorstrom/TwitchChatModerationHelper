[2023-01-10 09:25:20] <Finngus> I predict that today you will meet an EPIC Flareon
[2023-01-10 09:25:30] <%ocyc> panicBasket
[2023-01-10 09:25:38] <+michaelchany> epic and Flareon in the same sentence? impossible.
[2023-01-10 09:25:45] <Finngus> Absolutely
[2023-01-10 09:25:51] <Finngus> Whether it's epic in a good or bad sense will be seen
[2023-01-10 09:25:51] <%0ldmanbiff> what happened to the second vaporeon? I had to head to work as you pivoted to it.
[2023-01-10 09:25:53] <%ocyc> wrong we saw a couple decent vapos
[2023-01-10 09:26:05] <Finngus> And also whether it's on your side or the enemy's

[2023-01-10 09:26:23] <%+stellarsophia0> i really hope i can pull this off tho, if my lanturn wins, i won with a seed where the girl guarding an item searching for a moon stone, was actually guarding one LUL

[2023-01-10 09:26:32] <+michaelchany> @Finngus that's a fair point. but Flareon is already so bad that it's hard to imagine anything being epic bad
[2023-01-10 09:26:35] <%$markdash> I just lost my 13th seed to Phoebe

[2023-01-10 09:34:07] <%+OnlyShorts> @michaelchany yeah Nest Ball is 100% catch because it's catch rate is 40-level/10 and the Randomizer already boosts it
[2023-01-10 09:34:21] <Finngus> @A_Cool_Person It's the same catch rate as a Poke Ball outside the Safari Zone
[2023-01-10 09:34:28] <%+A_Cool_Person> its 1.5 inside zone 1x outside
[2023-01-10 09:34:32] <%+A_Cool_Person> damn
[2023-01-10 09:34:32] <%+OnlyShorts> Yeah it's a master ball effectively

[2023-01-10 09:36:52] <@%CarloBrown> LUL
[2023-01-10 09:36:55] <+michaelchany> Lure Ball is the one with higher catch rate during fishing encounters.
[2023-01-10 09:36:58] <%+Draggo__x3> @stellarsophia0 because it lowers accuracy so that's one way it is balanced
[2023-01-10 09:37:07] <%+stellarsophia0> @Mirby_Studios enjoying my moon stone LUL
[2023-01-10 09:37:07] <%+OnlyShorts> I dunno when nest ball stops being good, but afaik it's 100% for pretty much every pivot in FRLG or emerald

[2023-01-10 10:25:49] <%Cytyzent> I believe that's correct, bc mimic probably just looks at the ID location of the previous move, and sketch replaces it entirely

[2023-01-10 12:03:09] <raccoonator_orcaaaa> sonicboom is rlly good early
[2023-01-10 12:03:16] <%+flimmsovan> would have been enough with shockwave?
[2023-01-10 12:03:19] <%+Draggo__x3> So if this Marshtomp was level 1, and learned a new move; it'd replace Brick Break
[2023-01-10 12:03:26] <x3cr4ckx3> @Draggo__x3 yeah i didn't know that sky uppercut was from an older lanturn, i thought this had also sky uppercut
[2023-01-10 12:03:33] <%+Draggo__x3> ohhh I see
[2023-01-10 12:03:59] <%+Draggo__x3> you can tell if it might still have a move or not if the move has a * next to it in the tracker
[2023-01-10 12:03:59] <ultra_seanachu> LUL! "Fight me nerd."
[2023-01-10 12:04:29] <x3cr4ckx3> @Draggo__x3 good to know

[2023-01-10 12:05:59] <%+Draggo__x3> Dratini looks purple-ish in Violet/Scarlet still
[2023-01-10 12:06:05] <Kailaria> it'd bite its tail and go head over heels
[2023-01-10 12:06:06] <raccoonator_orcaaaa> hyper fang's nice
[2023-01-10 12:06:27] <vipple_> will dratini evolve to dragonair or something random?
[2023-01-10 12:06:30] <%+Draggo__x3> GBA games had limited colors that could be displayed on screen too, so that could've had a bit to do with it

[2023-01-10 13:48:17] <%$EDL666> Ye I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs required on everything
[2023-01-10 13:48:20] <mrcheesyshoes> you don't have an expiration date on salt either for example
[2023-01-10 13:48:28] <%AwakenSmok3> As long as its still good after 6 months, that's all I need to know :3

[2023-01-10 13:50:16] <deserteagle417> i'm sure 6 months is will within its usability period

[2023-01-10 13:51:04] <deserteagle417> looking online, it seems the typical expiration date of powdered milk is 18 months

[2023-01-10 14:13:21] <%$EDL666> why does Dragonair, a blue serpentine dragon evolve into a golden, more western dragon, when there is literally an evolution that's a blue serpentine dragon? (Gyarados)

[2023-01-10 14:13:34] <giantpenguin426> Speaking of Golduck - it has the best French version name, Akwakwak.
[2023-01-10 14:13:43] <%Cryten0> the randomiser I used had that as a harder logic setting

[2023-01-10 14:14:00] <@%ori_sky> hmm interesting thing, Psyduck's name in Japanese translates to "little duck" / "child duck", and there's a theory that the Gol for Golduck and Golbat is a short borrowed form of the word Goliath
[2023-01-10 14:14:03] <@%ori_sky> for "big duck"
[2023-01-10 14:14:06] <@%ori_sky> (and "big bat")
[2023-01-10 14:14:06] <deserteagle417> hovers aren't even required for major glitches stuff
[2023-01-10 14:14:21] <deserteagle417> only potentially required in no logic
[2023-01-10 14:14:30] <Finngus> @EDL666 Guess Dragonair could just as well be based on linnorms or other serpentine western dragons rather than lung dragons
[2023-01-10 14:15:01] <Estantia> I mean magikarp/gyrados is literally based on the joi fish jumping up the waterfall and becoming a dragon myth

[2023-01-10 15:16:34] <Fio_Hart> OH it was a butter sword thing
[2023-01-10 15:16:55] <%Taillow> Don't use butter on moths, got it.
[2023-01-10 15:17:30] <%Taillow> I wonder if it's a damage overflow thing.
[2023-01-10 15:18:06] <deserteagle417> the spikes and gold sword do the same damage
[2023-01-10 15:18:07] VIEWERS: 276
[2023-01-10 15:18:11] <%Taillow> Ah they just forgot to enter a value I guess.
[2023-01-10 15:18:16] <Fio_Hart> my friend had butter sword casually against moth
[2023-01-10 15:18:21] <deserteagle417> and the way they coded moth is to not take damage of that value
[2023-01-10 15:18:23] <sublimesinner> Gold sword is the same damage type as spike blocks and moth is immune
[2023-01-10 15:18:29] <%Taillow> Oh that makes sense too.
[2023-01-10 15:18:42] <Fio_Hart> we did fire rod XD it was hard we had to buy magic potions
[2023-01-10 15:18:51] <deserteagle417> gold sword beams would work, too
