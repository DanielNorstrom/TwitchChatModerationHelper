[2022-12-21 22:31:40] <%Sebleh> @jveetv you‚Äôre literally using the reason to be concerned to dismiss the concern. If all the flights to the north are backed up because of the storm, all major airports suffer and Atlanta is not an exception.

[2022-12-21 22:59:33] <miDnight_SC2> @PrayVS the standart UI has bossframes already but their representation is a bit .. cluttered to my taste
[2022-12-21 22:59:37] <Aldemortt> do u use moons at all @Naguura ? i sued to on legion but i hate them now
[2022-12-21 23:00:13] <PrayVS> i have elvui yeah

[2022-12-21 23:01:28] <miDnight_SC2> @PrayVS yeah with elvui it's easy  "unitframes > group units > boss" is where you can set up their settings and with toggle anchors you can move them
[2022-12-21 23:01:55] <+Bearlyaman> Switching off moons was the best decision I made this expac
[2022-12-21 23:01:58] <Aldemortt> my moon button its not the mushroom so they have no place in my bars sorry moons
[2022-12-21 23:02:02] <miDnight_SC2> @naguura how much do you care about getting starlord, boat and rattle "alligned"
