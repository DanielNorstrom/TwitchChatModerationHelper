[2022-12-08 18:14:15] <Actual4Head> The long term value of nuking their channel growth was not worth
[2022-12-08 18:14:17] <+AFLAPJACK> shroud and ninja made bank from the payout tho LUL
[2022-12-08 18:14:20] <%$Caelxnn> @Joeyyobo ohh i see, fair play then - surprised Twitch didn't try buy the rights tbf
[2022-12-08 18:14:20] <KenAdams> wth, i checked out a stremer on kick and the bio was how to make meth
[2022-12-08 18:14:22] <dontbanwaveyy> Microsoft lmao @kimbtw

[2022-12-08 18:14:30] <+fFuRiouSs> mixer was a classic example of betting on the streamer pulling people away from twitch, but people are so set on twitch
[2022-12-08 18:14:38] <+fFuRiouSs> that that didn't work
[2022-12-08 18:14:39] VIEWERS: 896

[2022-12-08 18:14:55] <HOTPOT4T0> I can't imagine watching streams anywhere but twitch
[2022-12-08 18:14:55] <%$Gerbsoda> bro Shroud made so much money that he hired a private jet one time just to get home in time for a WoW raid or some shit KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:15:03] <+lukey95> do the zombies wonder up to your base or nah?

[2022-12-08 18:15:15] <AHeroicBear> Youtube is nice as you can pause and rewind
[2022-12-08 18:15:15] <%$Caelxnn> @Joeyyobo yeah maybe, amazon would have tried by now if it was possible lmao
[2022-12-08 18:15:16] <absynth123> A walking platform on the wall would be cool to patrol the perimeter
[2022-12-08 18:15:18] <ScfSwordLord> twitch will only die when the boomers arrive, like facebook did
[2022-12-08 18:15:18] <spiderlauncher> does digging a line of graves infrot of the walls help
[2022-12-08 18:15:23] <+fFuRiouSs> like shroud got 15-20mill and they paid out his contract in full when they closed the site, so didn't screw people over
[2022-12-08 18:15:23] <Bigsy> @zouzanor94 UK moment
