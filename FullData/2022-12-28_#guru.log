You can !gamble any amount over 10, !slots any amount over 100 (slightly rigged but has big payout if you win), or !duel any amount with anyone in chat (ex. !duel username amount). You can also check how much you have by !eggs or use !leaderboard and see where you stand with everyone else guuWICKED *the channel point redeem egg and anti-egg don’t adjust the amount of eggs you have.

[2022-12-28 09:01:53] <@%Scytal_> @Velocinator On November 10, it announced that the Strawberry Frosty will go away in favor of a seasonal Peppermint Frosty. That stole headlines as the fast food chain promised a unique take on seasonal indulgences. However, buried inside that limited-time offer is the promise that the Vanilla Frosty will make a return to the menu.
