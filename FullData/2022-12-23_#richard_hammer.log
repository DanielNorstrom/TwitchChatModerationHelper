[2022-12-23 02:51:25] <%mihns> All I know is a bunch of artists are upset because their work was used to "train" the things without consent/compensation. Which is pretty shitty.

[2022-12-23 02:52:52] <%mihns> an actual person sitting down and studying a painting is not remotely the same as feeding images into a program
[2022-12-23 02:53:03] <%mihns> if you don't understand that we're not going to get anywhere.
[2022-12-23 02:53:45] <%mihns> yeah, it would be a similar comparison if the AI had self-determination.

[2022-12-23 05:06:32] <$NeverEndingPizza> life if a companies cost go up 10% they shouldn't be making 20% more than they were before
[2022-12-23 05:06:34] <%+Felstrike> You say corporate greed, I mean what’s the difference, if everything goes up and it rolls down hill, what the hell is the difference honestly
[2022-12-23 05:06:58] <%+bortz29> It doesn’t roll downhill or if it does not at the same rate
[2022-12-23 05:07:18] <%+Felstrike> Well that’s how rolling down hill works, it’s bigger at the bottom

[2022-12-23 06:35:40] <RedRabbitRomp> A guy in my home state killed a bear with a pistol but not before it got its jaw tangled in his Achilles tendon.
[2022-12-23 06:35:40] <brdWizard> most days we, as humans, get mauled even if the bear dies

[2022-12-23 06:38:27] <HoneyMacs> in the southeast they're just over populated and infested with ticks
[2022-12-23 06:38:30] <+Teeras101> the reason most deer die is of old age or communal disease from over population

[2022-12-23 07:24:15] <%$mord_> Isn't the reason they are unconnected to the rest of the country because they refuse to do the work to prevent their power systems from fucking everyone else in an outage?

[2022-12-23 08:58:24] <ReformingOne> by the way since you've got all that coal can you drop it all off at my sister's place
[2022-12-23 08:58:34] <%Darmanimon> I just want a game to come out that's like the Metal Slug games I loved when I was younger, but better
[2022-12-23 08:58:36] <ShowtimeTylers> @PhatMatt1297 I have PC and I use both depending on the game

[2022-12-23 08:59:15] <+CreteTTV> @Darmanimon I'm just waiting for that quality side-scroller that never ends.. they just keep adding panels, and bosses and just keep going "right"
[2022-12-23 08:59:37] <ShowtimeTylers> perfectly fine, I get it. I just like to lean back when I game a lot of the time but precision gaming I need a mouse. @PhatMatt1297
[2022-12-23 08:59:49] <%Darmanimon> Super Meat Boy Forever was a little bit like that, I loved that game. Now I need something like it but as a sidescrolling shooter
[2022-12-23 08:59:55] <%Spurpshub> it's fine just sitont he floor indoors for a few days and you'll cure

[2022-12-23 09:02:04] <%StPharmacist> that's my biggest issue with first person games. it makes you seem like you are 3 feet tall

[2022-12-23 09:03:35] <+BubbatheScrub> like, the proportions are only correct for a specific FoV.

[2022-12-23 09:06:17] <+PhatMatt1297> I can understand why you might want to stay put on this map, like if you want to completely explore a map before moving on, but you don't always have that luxury in this game. you're a forager now ...
[2022-12-23 09:06:27] <+CreteTTV> so, progression basically locked by your willingness to walk in random direction?
[2022-12-23 09:06:40] <%Darmanimon> they open the crates that drop and give you skins for you knife in CS:GO

[2022-12-23 09:07:44] <+PhatMatt1297> your foraging progression could stall out.
[2022-12-23 09:07:54] <%+MrZev> when you read books is raises your skill in it some.
[2022-12-23 09:07:57] <+CreteTTV> yabut.. there is a point of no return from this lighthouse? And going past it is just prep-progression i suppose
