[2022-12-20 02:07:58] <%+Catsonel> A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae. The terrestrial juvenile phase is called an eft. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however.

[2022-12-20 02:52:14] <+khayanami> starting out in Apex is a bad time, but once you're on that rollercoaster it's hard to stop
[2022-12-20 02:52:15] <%+deadzombieking> another thing with 7 days to die is eventually depending on your setting is there will be a big horde of zombies that will attack your base
[2022-12-20 02:52:22] <mikedepaveli> Apex is brutal
[2022-12-20 02:52:41] <+khayanami> Apex is SOOO brutal if you're new, you really need to push through the beginning losses
[2022-12-20 02:52:45] <%MrCL1P> apex sweats are a dif breed
[2022-12-20 02:52:49] <%+mysticangel18> Apex is for those cracked out players

[2022-12-20 10:34:01] <%atomchoco> dead game i guess
[2022-12-20 10:34:03] <indeboss> @detexion no
[2022-12-20 10:34:06] <linsch8> MMR matters more, and people are ranking up from their lower resets... its making lobbies weird
[2022-12-20 10:34:07] <tyko_wrld> rank system should be based on how good you did in the match
[2022-12-20 10:34:13] <indeboss> was it long ago or just recently?
[2022-12-20 10:34:14] <hofman06> maybe they werent brons 5 at the moment
[2022-12-20 10:34:16] <wicked_menace666> it just came out

[2022-12-20 10:34:27] <+AdrianLTR> there is a water crisis in LA?
[2022-12-20 10:34:28] <boxtsn> I dont think multiple rankings is the issue, they just arent transparent with ranks in games anymore. In OW1 they showed everyones rank, they took that away in this game
[2022-12-20 10:34:32] <wicked_menace666> it is difficult to login to btw
[2022-12-20 10:34:53] <tyko_wrld> in my opinion ow got the worst ranking system from other games
[2022-12-20 10:34:55] <wicked_menace666> apparantly yes bc of the water drying out i think
