[2022-12-07 18:08:38] <sipharty3> nefrums build, can't pretend Kappa
[2022-12-07 18:09:02] <@Nefrums> always more time spent on not geting it than you spend picking up a few peces of steel and handcrafting it.
[2022-12-07 18:09:10] <pantaboo> 5%
[2022-12-07 18:10:46] <%+1amgr8ful> Those Chip bases do "nothing more" than producing green circuits and then... what happens to the chips?

[2022-12-07 18:11:39] <sipharty3> T
[2022-12-07 18:11:45] <+McToben> for example: you have a bluprint with tier 1 assemblers and then again the same bluprint but wit tier 2 asselmblers
[2022-12-07 18:11:57] <sipharty3> nha, only upgrade tool
[2022-12-07 18:12:00] <sipharty3> TT
[2022-12-07 18:12:11] <+McToben> is there a way to upgrade the exiisting buildings with the 2. bluprint?
[2022-12-07 18:12:19] <pantaboo> @McToben doesnt work, unfortunately
[2022-12-07 18:12:24] <sipharty3> T
[2022-12-07 18:12:32] <pantaboo> @McToben no
[2022-12-07 18:12:45] <+McToben> thats unfortunate. but thanksy anyway
