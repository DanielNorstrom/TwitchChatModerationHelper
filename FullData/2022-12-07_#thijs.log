[2022-12-07 13:43:29] <mr_murmuhielo> Thijs I like the idea of playing control decks. I feel like you need a high IQ and a good disposal to think in the long term to be able to truly understand control decks like this. Managing your resources and keeping your life total at 70 hp is not easy at all, and without a deep knowledge of the mechanics of the game, most of the subtle plays would go unnoticed for non-genius players.

[2022-12-07 13:48:46] <Klinn_Jilsey> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

[2022-12-07 14:22:50] <@%^Streamlabs> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

[2022-12-07 17:03:38] <Zaxlor> @sterbenfear So Marvel Snap had a bug where if you opened up a pack, nothing was inside. They gave EVERYONE, even people who didn't have the bug 200 gold (that's the Snap version of Runestones), for free. They kept everyone up to date on discord/twitter/reddit/in-game. Blizzard hasn't said a thing about re-rolling cards KEKW

[2022-12-07 17:03:47] <adamplays86> @Thijs can i replace Astalor in this deck ?
