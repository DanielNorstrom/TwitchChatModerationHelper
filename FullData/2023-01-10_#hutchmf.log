[2023-01-10 00:16:02] <hmartin317> Ya I don’t think it was a snipe I think that’s just the map right now every time I have watched someone play it there is a hacker I watched willerz try today and it was almost every raid there

[2023-01-10 00:17:49] <%+FromThenToThen> turn the picture in the background around so it stops reflecting your screen. May sound paranoid but software can clear the image up. tried pm a mod but......
[2023-01-10 00:17:55] <TaxIsTheft> @shabuti_san sounds like cheating to find cheaters
[2023-01-10 00:17:57] <+o7General> wouldnt be surprised if he bought fake credit cards to fund his cheating obsession
[2023-01-10 00:17:57] <+xmrbigsx> “I’m not cheating” lmao
[2023-01-10 00:18:00] <Arbiter9605> @shabuti_san um doubt that is remotely possible since cheats are client side.

[2023-01-10 03:31:40] <@%+Yawger> thats super sus alone then....
[2023-01-10 03:31:41] <+IUSECAPSL0CK> Statistically IS supposed to happen poker. 1 in a 10k chance is statistically very probable when you have 100k hands
[2023-01-10 03:31:45] <%+Jukes905> Nope his damage taken from a is less than a average lvl 16 or something
[2023-01-10 03:31:55] <+ham_master_flex> @txixxy who is it?
[2023-01-10 03:31:55] <%HAIL_DIABLO> The fishy part is his stats page. @HutchMF A lot of it makes little to no sense.
[2023-01-10 03:31:56] <Changing_you> he streamed but his twitch acc is banned now
[2023-01-10 03:32:00] <+Mukooda> hes used 25 meds lol
[2023-01-10 03:32:07] <+curlyfriesncoke1> Yeah look at heal  xp compared to toothy and Trey it’s like half of theirs

[2023-01-10 03:32:14] <+Raaiders> @HutchMF he does stream. i can show you clips. he is cheating 100%
[2023-01-10 03:32:14] <@%+Yawger> Like why wouldnt someone like that stream... If you're clouting yourself the best EFT player in the world...... YOU WOULD STREAM... Bottom line.

[2023-01-10 03:32:37] <+ThePcMasterRace> he only has 10k healing xp
[2023-01-10 03:32:37] <Snow0G> LUL

[2023-01-10 03:32:53] <Sanjo__> @HutchMF It only counts when you use the last bit of a med. check how many meds you have used.....
[2023-01-10 03:32:55] <%+Jukes905> He doesn’t stream- and plays more than some people job

[2023-01-10 03:33:13] <@%+Yawger> I mean... I just wanna know which cheat he uses... Cause he could get a sponsor deal with that company
[2023-01-10 03:33:15] <+Raaiders> @Scuba_SK the one in bunker on reserve is so obvious he isnt a 25 kda player
[2023-01-10 03:33:15] <%darozay> feel like bsg could easily look over his account and figure it out if legit or not
[2023-01-10 03:33:18] <RiddledWithGuilt> if you are that good at EFT you dont even need to be entertaining and you will get views seems crazy not to stream
[2023-01-10 03:33:21] <+PatWhosthat> meds isnt accurate! mine says 4 used and ive used way more then 4 med
[2023-01-10 03:33:23] <+thetroydozer> I dont play this game. What is a kappa case?

[2023-01-10 03:45:16] <%lil_izy69> guys it doesn't matter which way he was running the guy was cheating he would have caught up eventually
[2023-01-10 03:45:34] <JTOctavius> can't really get clout for sniping whilst stream sniping I don't understand that logic just my thought process cohhHmm
[2023-01-10 03:45:46] <%+officialJakeTheApe> @Bailz94 gotcha i thought he was only a couple quest off
[2023-01-10 03:45:57] <%sovvagn> @lil_izy69 You don't know for sure he was cheating
[2023-01-10 03:45:59] <%Bailz94> don't see how some ppl can't say it's sus when they're tailing them across whole map LUL LUL

[2023-01-10 03:49:55] <Doctorboster> can someone explain the found in raid loot system I haven't played since it was introduced, can I do a runthrough and still have the found in raid?
[2023-01-10 03:49:56] <%Bailz94> I think they was sniping as duo or something maybe not cheating. they just knew way too much info without sum or curtis seeing any of them just a direction lol
[2023-01-10 03:49:58] <+uEnvy_> i am
[2023-01-10 03:49:58] <%sovvagn> @lil_izy69 I'll give you stream sniping most definitely. I've seen some very good snipers that play this game and that "track and shot" was definitely possible

[2023-01-10 17:21:51] <+Maddogg27> Do u think it will drive players away?
[2023-01-10 17:21:51] <%Seinfelduh> I agree with that but HOW much longer will it really stretch it
[2023-01-10 17:21:52] <d4nnydoux> @HutchMF Prolonged gameplay is the best for every walk of life in tarkov
[2023-01-10 17:21:55] <syrus_virus96> everyone crying about changes..but actually its good slows the game a lot
[2023-01-10 17:21:55] <abeester> Do people quit when they get the best shit or somethign

[2023-01-10 17:22:28] <abeester> @Seinfelduh Interesting... I'm fine with that I think
[2023-01-10 17:22:28] <+Ultra_Sur76> but what good is the ammo change if higher tier players can still get tier 4/5 body armor and the lower tiers guys using bb's?
[2023-01-10 17:22:32] <%Seinfelduh> @abeester yes lots quit when they max out traders and such
[2023-01-10 17:22:33] <FamSisher> so is bp only a lootable item now?
[2023-01-10 17:22:35] <beejayWL> people quit when they get the best and people quit when they are dying to the best

[2023-01-10 18:42:49] <misterHouse38> Biggest issues im having rn with this wipe is learning quests is hard when they send you to areas on the map everyone goes too
[2023-01-10 18:42:57] <$Bakerrrjay> Yeah but what about all the chads already running around?

[2023-01-10 18:44:09] <+geazar> ppbs is the best right?
[2023-01-10 18:44:09] <WTFGameNation> are cheaters always a problem or is it mainly a new wipe thing
[2023-01-10 18:44:16] <dylanroddy> congratulations on the engagement ya no nipple bitch, you've also got the other half walking around the house singing give me a hell give me a yeah 🥴🖕

[2023-01-10 18:44:34] <darth4g> everyone is being cry baby's about this new change. This game isn't cod it's a hard core survival people need to realize that
[2023-01-10 18:44:35] <kylejmw> why is it so easy to cheat?
[2023-01-10 18:44:41] <+edgelord535> cheaters have always been a problem but this wipe is exceptionally bad
[2023-01-10 18:44:41] <+fitton89> Cheats seems worse this time, with the floating people and speedy runners
[2023-01-10 18:44:41] <%+BrewerLive> Chat and Hutch. I got married last Sunday!
[2023-01-10 18:44:43] <%lil_izy69> I guess but I wouldn't think impacts would need removing @HutchMF
[2023-01-10 18:44:44] <xFalse1> cheaters are the reason i havent played the last 4 wipes
[2023-01-10 18:44:45] <+MozerDozerr> Holy shit
[2023-01-10 18:44:47] <+Virzo255> can you still craft high level rounds in the hideout?

[2023-01-10 18:45:20] <%HAIL_DIABLO> @Virzo255 Yes, but it's typically just enough ammo for a raid or two.
[2023-01-10 18:45:21] <LivLivin> anticheat is good, game itself is shit

[2023-01-10 18:45:50] <+Fustuv> @LivLivin If you think battleeye is a good anti-cheat im sorry to say you are heavily mistaken
[2023-01-10 18:45:54] <+Virzo255> @HAIL_DIABLO BP craft on cool down for a week or two and you are set for a bit
[2023-01-10 18:45:58] <+MozerDozerr> This game needs camomo so bad

[2023-01-10 18:46:11] <@%+Yawger> TBF... cheats in games are like PEDs in sports... there's always something new that will get through the testing. And its a very reactive thing for the anti cheat Devs.
[2023-01-10 18:46:11] <WTFGameNation> thanks for the info hutch gg on the raid

[2023-01-10 18:46:33] <0x0Byte> the problem with information cheats is you have no way to know its happening unless you install a root kit like vals anti

[2023-01-10 18:46:54] <+guardj> I think that’s what bsg wants so that the hackers can keep buying the game and making them more revenue

[2023-01-10 18:48:24] <%+dani_vic> @guardj hackers dont usually buy the game every time they are banned. Hackers have websites that they buy hacked/stolen accounts
[2023-01-10 18:48:29] <%+dani_vic> been like that for decades

[2023-01-10 20:15:31] <%+raahzi> @HutchMF being 100%  honest how bad are cheaters this wipe? i've only run 4 raids but 2 of them had a guy run up to people and tell them  to drop certain items cause he could see their inventory and the last one was no clipping/aimbotting.
[2023-01-10 20:15:36] <%+PwnzaloT_TV> @tomc1k but gingy and timmy are both professional gamers who are payed to play games. so both are better at game and at being a teamate then most ppl bc they do this every day all day

[2023-01-10 20:15:53] <%+raahzi> i could very well just have absolute shit luck but 3/4 raids having cheats was rough, should i try to join wipe again?
[2023-01-10 20:15:59] <p1zzzaroll> @raahzi just play the game bro. cheaters gonna cheat. don't sweat it

[2023-01-10 23:06:47] <%+PwnzaloT_TV> i think BSG should add some static spawns for things such as good ammo and key cards and such... it would turn the areas that have the static spawns into hot zones and allow everyone a fair chance at the gear every raid.
