[2023-01-09 15:04:09] <%daselectah> Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation. Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when people living in Romania were boiling spring water to extract the salts; a salt-works in China has been found which dates to approximately the same period.  Nowadays, the biggest salt deposit can be found in the Netherlands thanks to a well known twitch streamer.

You can increase the chance of winning a siege by using artillery for breaches, or by starting in advance to make sure you have the most time available. There is always a little bit of luck involved.

[2023-01-09 15:05:47] <%daselectah> @Florryworry Salt is an essential nutrient and the amount of salt in the diet influences health. Too much salt can raise blood pressure and may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in susceptible populations. The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day.
