[2023-01-01 14:19:01] <jin_sakai44> Happy new year dino. We also stayed home. I think it‚Äôs absolute okay to chill on the couch. Nobody has to feel bad to stay home. In my opinion this new year party‚Äôs are to much overrated.
[2023-01-01 14:19:06] <icds_nutz> Sekiro weapon change Hmmm
[2023-01-01 14:19:16] <%RahdeeeLOA> one of my cats watched the fireworks and for the other, scared one, i built a little soundproof cardboard castle with my bedsheets

[2023-01-01 14:20:21] <TysonJDevereaux> After I came home, I tried to stay up all night, but htere were no interesting streams on twitch
[2023-01-01 14:20:27] <%+alexcon18> i remember beating sekiro base vitality and it wasnt that bad, then tried at 1 and couldnt do it. i think best i did is get to corrupted monk kekw
[2023-01-01 14:20:27] <icds_nutz> just use the lightning resin YEP
[2023-01-01 14:20:28] <%katjers> lot less fireworks here, was quite happy for all the doggos and cats
[2023-01-01 14:20:30] <%Jammy20466> sounds good Nico
[2023-01-01 14:20:30] <%ErrSousa> @dinossindgeil Do you still do the same strat for the anor londo archers? Walk and wait for the arrow then run to the window?

[2023-01-01 17:13:09] <@%+Lakerr_> FelidaeSocialis without a doubt ER will be easier in this run than what he just did. but with the opportunity to block weapons it could get different Shruge
[2023-01-01 17:13:13] <%yoyasuper> DS2 needs a new version with all the cut content
[2023-01-01 17:13:22] <icds_nutz> did you grab Power Within as well?

[2023-01-01 17:13:35] <@%voax> there is a lot of cut content in ds2
[2023-01-01 17:13:45] <%BenderZGreat> Power Within = Blighttown, not a fun pickup usually
[2023-01-01 17:13:48] <@%voax> like the game got overhauled like 2 times at least
[2023-01-01 17:13:51] <%SandorTheMandor> Hi there Dino, does this run include DLC bosses?

[2023-01-01 17:14:07] <icds_nutz> it's the item that's in front of the large monster blocking the pipe in Blighttown
[2023-01-01 17:14:22] <%Dooglie> DS2 was originally supposed to be 972 bosses, but Miyazaki was talked out of it
[2023-01-01 17:14:23] <%dvsimple> with all the magical stuff in this game it kinda bugs me the way the character holds this hammer, it would be so tiring
[2023-01-01 17:14:25] <%yoyasuper> ds2 had very rough development so they had to cut alot of content
[2023-01-01 17:14:25] <Marzhmellow_> Just be you <3

[2023-01-01 18:18:12] <%Scritoon> @thaewrapt Kind of. I have never played one so I can't 100% say. Its got a story and while the main character is unvoiced there are lots of characters that do talk and you can talk to. There are a lot of indepth cutscenes that tell the story similar to other rpgs (DA, Witcher, ME, etc.) But the gameplay is similar to souls in that you explore map, kill enemies and boss

[2023-01-01 18:20:13] <%Scritoon> @thaewrapt My personal impression was it was like souls crossed with Dragon Age. The gameplay/combat is souls but you get cool abilities and fully fleshed out story.

[2023-01-01 18:21:15] <%vladzitka> about two months, work was hectic :) But I saw the god run 3 on youtube, that was epic! :D
[2023-01-01 18:21:31] <%Scritoon> @Wendy_of_thepinkhair Yes it is a definitely a soulslike. But it focuses more on story and characters than gameplay. So thats why I say if you want souls you will be disappointed, but if you want a story rpg that actually has pretty good combat then you will probably like it
