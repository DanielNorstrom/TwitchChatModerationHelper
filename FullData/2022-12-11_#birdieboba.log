[2022-12-11 06:04:06] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/

[2022-12-11 07:34:59] <White_Blaze> Take note the following is purly speculation, not spoilers. That guy assumes this is the the prisim was designed for destorying monster eggs, but watch it be that it was actually meant to empower the "god" of the people who built said shrine via sacrificing eggs in it. --and the reason charles grew is because he absorbled the energy in palce of whom ever the prism was designed to empower.. Just a BET.

[2022-12-11 07:59:32] <monkeyman4298> only thing that does dmg to train is the rocket launcher
[2022-12-11 07:59:50] <%reivehnfliyt> amazing how you can punt high caliber ordinance through the body of your locomotive
[2022-12-11 07:59:56] <longboi174> rip
[2022-12-11 07:59:59] <monkeyman4298> rocket launcher has huge dmg but it can hurt ur train quite a bit

[2022-12-11 08:10:52] <%reivehnfliyt> This concept of a train empowered with demonic power by cultic worship has me thinking it'd be awesome to make a freaky ww1 themed concept with a cursed tank or something.

[2022-12-11 08:11:04] <White_Blaze> even if you slightly pas a rail switch, you can still reverse back onto the right track after flipping the switch rather then needing to back up first. its got something to do with the way train tracks work.
