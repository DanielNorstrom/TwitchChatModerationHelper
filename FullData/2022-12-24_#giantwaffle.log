[2022-12-24 17:52:23] <@%$Apparentthreat> Kuroiorb when y'all shorthand "blazedasthesun" do you say "blazed" or "blaze" ?
[2022-12-24 17:52:31] <%DX_Plates> A wet paper bag would win against blazed

[2022-12-24 17:59:25] <@%$Apparentthreat> TigerLuv i think the point of saying vtuber is the "virtual avatar" part
[2022-12-24 18:00:02] <@%$Apparentthreat> TigerLuv if waffle were to use a virtual avatar he'd then be a vtuber
[2022-12-24 18:00:08] <$Stillglade> its not a you that is tubing, it is a virtual that is tubing
[2022-12-24 18:00:19] <%TigerLuv> Apparentthreat oh, that is way beyond my internet knowledge. I built the internet, but then left it for you kids to take over

[2022-12-24 18:43:57] <+Babyblasphemy> "This type of 1:1 transformer is classed as an isolation transformer as both the primary and secondary windings of the transformer have the same number of volts per turn."
[2022-12-24 18:44:48] <BMYGRLFRND> it just isolates the DC, because only the AC gets transferred to the secondary coil, so if you have 1:1 windings, it keeps the voltage

[2022-12-24 20:17:43] <Mazzelfassel> I think there is a mod in the pack that can autocraft to a certain level
[2022-12-24 20:17:48] <kane1941> you can put interface and output right into it, saving you a bus
[2022-12-24 20:17:51] <+Exerion09> Tell an ME interface to keep stock and it'll autocraft
[2022-12-24 20:17:52] <+Koeckie> crafting card in an interface, but you need a pattern for it so it can request the item
[2022-12-24 20:17:53] <+ns0z> Use an interface to input items and level emitter on machine with redstone control
[2022-12-24 20:17:54] <$jordan2185> Round robin is working though
[2022-12-24 20:17:55] <officialhunterx> whats the plan for today
[2022-12-24 20:17:55] <Mazzelfassel> Lazy AE2
[2022-12-24 20:18:15] <+Koeckie> yes you can set a number in the interface
[2022-12-24 20:18:18] <%Narcotical> Level emitter it
[2022-12-24 20:18:19] <+ns0z> You can have an interface put items in without pattern
[2022-12-24 20:18:20] <%TelRehiad> he wants a "keep in stock" vs dynamic request.
[2022-12-24 20:18:23] <kane1941> it would just export items constantly
[2022-12-24 20:18:35] <PistolPeteHogan> Ya a level emitter does exactly that.
[2022-12-24 20:18:44] <%Narcotical> Keep in stock is level emitter
[2022-12-24 20:18:49] <%TigerLuv> HahaPoint HahaNyandeer
[2022-12-24 20:18:49] <PistolPeteHogan> You tell it how many items to keep in stock and it does that

[2022-12-24 20:20:38] <%Narcotical> Interface will work and is a lot faster
[2022-12-24 20:20:39] <n00rman_> using an interface with item conduits in much easier

[2022-12-24 20:20:46] <+Koeckie> it is
[2022-12-24 20:20:49] <PeterZ_97> interface + ender io + drawer to set max quantity?
[2022-12-24 20:20:50] <+ns0z> Interfaces is the superior solution for this
[2022-12-24 20:20:56] <+wonly> dont you just use import and level emitter?
[2022-12-24 20:20:59] <+Mexzw> think best thing is an import bus with crafting card and restone card.. with a level emitter
[2022-12-24 20:21:07] <+AnesthesiaFC> nope hard out of that path lol
[2022-12-24 20:21:25] <Mazzelfassel> Ok just checked the Nomifactory page and the Lazy AE2 with the Level-Maintainer is an optional mod.

[2022-12-24 20:30:06] <%CiVR> civr2Fishbang
[2022-12-24 20:30:08] <n00rman_> you request everything in the interface then item conduit to multiple alloy furnaces from there
[2022-12-24 20:30:09] <%0sem0> Don't you need to request them?
[2022-12-24 20:30:12] <n00rman_> plus limited item filters
[2022-12-24 20:30:21] <+TheSeabeast> have the interface provide the ingredients
[2022-12-24 20:30:33] <officialhunterx> seems like chat is telling you different setups
[2022-12-24 20:30:36] <+TheSeabeast> yeeee
[2022-12-24 20:30:39] <LLA_YouDontKnow1> in the interface, if you tell it to keep certain amounts of the required items in stock
[2022-12-24 20:30:42] <wolfd91> YES
[2022-12-24 20:30:43] <kane1941> Chat he doesn not want to craft on demand. The idea was to always export constantly
[2022-12-24 20:31:05] <+Koeckie> it depends, if you need the "raw" items anytime you have to do it that way, or every single item will be exported
[2022-12-24 20:31:05] <sepjoo> robot arm
[2022-12-24 20:31:05] <wolfd91> thank god xd
[2022-12-24 20:31:09] <weightmaker> put a robot arm as cover on the alloy smelter
[2022-12-24 20:31:09] <+iTents> Wrench the interface to set the arrows
[2022-12-24 20:31:10] <kypudo> then export bus with level emiter
[2022-12-24 20:31:13] <sepjoo> will help ypu import
[2022-12-24 20:31:19] <n00rman_> use item conduits. this way you can automate like 4-5 alloy furnaces with one interface
[2022-12-24 20:31:32] <kyadum> lmao
[2022-12-24 20:31:35] <wolfd91> you dont

[2022-12-24 20:31:41] <Yakobro> youi dont need it
[2022-12-24 20:31:41] <IAmJester> you can make the interface directional with a wrench, yea?
[2022-12-24 20:31:41] <sepjoo> u dont need pattern there
[2022-12-24 20:31:41] <wolfd91> yes
[2022-12-24 20:31:43] <%+brenner1265> I think you can wrench the interface to push items out

[2022-12-24 20:32:04] <wolfd91> yes
[2022-12-24 20:32:09] <wolfd91> you can import into the interface
[2022-12-24 20:32:15] <kane1941> switch that interface into a bus?
[2022-12-24 20:32:15] <officialhunterx> make you have a level emitter to stop importer
[2022-12-24 20:32:18] <n00rman_> you don't need import buses either this way. just import it into the interface

[2022-12-24 20:32:30] <weightmaker> right clicking robot arms on GT machines gives it pull/push ability
[2022-12-24 20:32:33] <kane1941> you can stop the enderio cable
[2022-12-24 20:32:36] <Shoobinist> can stop the conduit
[2022-12-24 20:32:43] <wolfd91> you can stop the nmachine with a machine controller and emitter facein towards it
[2022-12-24 20:33:04] <Yakobro> @Giantwaffle you can also output the smelters to a drawer that's connected to a controller with storage bus to cap the output
[2022-12-24 20:33:10] <weightmaker> conduit will prob fill both slots with same item
[2022-12-24 20:33:16] <officialhunterx> you don't want to stop the interface or the conduit if you planning to automate multiple alloys
[2022-12-24 20:33:29] <+madseed15> ur interface doesn't store recipe
[2022-12-24 20:33:31] <+TheGeekPeek> Use the item limit conduit filter to put one stack of each item in the slots without double fill
[2022-12-24 20:33:42] <BlackNocturne> You inserted on green
[2022-12-24 20:33:46] <%thecodealive_original> do you need to point it down?

[2022-12-24 20:34:08] <wolfd91> make a shit ton of those

[2022-12-24 20:34:18] <%+LaroStar007> the bottom item conduit is disabled @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-24 20:34:25] <weightmaker> robot arm with item filter is much better
[2022-12-24 20:34:27] <+TheGeekPeek> you put the stack and amount of each and it will play them per action
[2022-12-24 20:34:39] <+iTents> @thecodealive_original Only if he wasn't using the item conduit. You shouldnt have to point the interface if your using an item conduit
[2022-12-24 20:34:56] <+madseed15> maybe interface to a chest?
[2022-12-24 20:35:01] <officialhunterx> make sure the alloy smelter is facing down
[2022-12-24 20:35:05] <%+dax573> screwdriver the top
[2022-12-24 20:35:10] <NoisyPlays> is the item filter in blacklist or whitelist mode

[2022-12-24 20:36:54] <+iTents> You can do several recipies with a single Interface also
[2022-12-24 20:36:57] <kane1941> its bottlenecking, increase the stacks a bit
[2022-12-24 20:37:00] <+iTents> Just filter the input to each machine
[2022-12-24 20:37:03] <%TelRehiad> you can do multiple recipies per interface too.
[2022-12-24 20:37:16] <officialhunterx> problem.is once one is full the other won't work
[2022-12-24 20:37:23] <wolfd91> are you gonna use a new interface for each automation?

[2022-12-24 22:41:26] <Caraceus> europe also has provincial capitals

[2022-12-24 22:41:42] <sprockettes> canadas provincial capitals arent always the major city
[2022-12-24 22:41:44] <Staticsprite> The Netherlands has the same. We have provinces with each an own 'capital'
[2022-12-24 22:41:44] <+Zyie> In most cases that I know of, even if other countries have states, they're not as separated as the US is, with it's own set of laws and such.
[2022-12-24 22:41:45] <mahoraz> but do you have enough capital to say that
[2022-12-24 22:41:53] <Skylance117> the thing is USA is a federation of states, dodnt knew that Australia was a federation
[2022-12-24 22:41:57] <kingasasin177> I know...
[2022-12-24 22:41:59] <+prairydog> DC is kinda weird tbh
[2022-12-24 22:41:59] <fedeoeae> but european countries are subdivided in regions as well, we just don't call them "states" as that is an english word

[2022-12-24 22:42:02] <kingasasin177> but due to video games

[2022-12-24 23:16:09] <Yakobro> @DeadMrEd patterns means on-demand crafting, which is real slow and not great to use for general components, passive crafting is way better really
