[2023-01-05 02:06:47] <+NexusVanwilder> I remember from playing the game SCUM that they had the same sound issue, apparently its very difficult to implement sound vertically
[2023-01-05 02:06:49] <%+ShaunShep_> @VanderSalad They do but sometimes it bugs out
[2023-01-05 02:06:55] <%siddo__> @OnEeYdWiLy press RMB, freelook and look around until your FOV zooms out. find the center again, press tab while holding RMB and there you go. try it out in an offline raid
[2023-01-05 02:06:55] <+weed_911> you gonna play some tarkov with shroud soon?

[2023-01-05 02:08:19] <+VanderSalad> Have any of you had silent pushes up stairs with this one? it's still really hard to locate where sound comes from but I haven't experienced the old silent stair zone shit like it was in the past
[2023-01-05 02:08:21] <@%WillerZ> @Klean You can hop in with us tomorrow if were on and you are

[2023-01-05 02:08:38] <+maxxeypad> do drops progress not carry over between streams?
[2023-01-05 02:08:44] <Sabotacer> Was on deadlyslob stream and he didnt understand anything about the sounds in interchange
[2023-01-05 02:08:54] <@%WillerZ> WE NEED SAN TAPE AND COTTAGE YOU GOT IT?
[2023-01-05 02:08:59] <%wubnoxious> @dabsNbrews I use it with Bi off
[2023-01-05 02:09:00] <theReal_McCoy> I think it be cool if even if you had EOD you could start with an alpha and quest up to your gamma.  Even start with a level 1 stash too.  Have they thought about doing that?
[2023-01-05 02:09:04] <BradAssault> @Sabotacer sound is whack
[2023-01-05 02:09:05] <KingVegasLive> sup Klean hope you had a great semi day off

[2023-01-05 02:09:57] <+VanderSalad> @hurricanefx we tested the stairs in big red and theyre no longer quiet now which makes me hope that stair occlusion zones are at least better

[2023-01-05 02:13:27] <+VanderSalad> I think more than anything that shows how absolutely fucked audio currently is over how "good" DTX is, not to downplay how effective it may be for some people right now

[2023-01-05 02:14:13] <+VanderSalad> With binaural on and off btw
[2023-01-05 02:14:19] <theReal_McCoy> havent seen this gun yet
[2023-01-05 02:14:20] <Gavlakel> what did Nikita say about the audio?
[2023-01-05 02:14:31] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> does binaural on cause framerate issues?>
[2023-01-05 02:14:32] <+Overcast22> Can we watch the video on stream please like we used to?
[2023-01-05 02:14:40] <hummy_marek> I have 50percent less frames with binaural
[2023-01-05 02:14:41] <ygxbillz> hey chat
[2023-01-05 02:14:58] <EskimoBrather> i would use it for the rain alone LUL
[2023-01-05 02:15:03] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> do we need to have binaural on with DTS?
[2023-01-05 02:15:10] <DANGERM4US> @hummy_marek same, i get about 20+ more frames with it off
[2023-01-05 02:15:11] <+Matraxxs> Sounds much better
[2023-01-05 02:15:12] <%BSDilly> It does remove that staticy bass the rain gives, sounds like brown noise
[2023-01-05 02:15:13] <SomaVision> I wonder if there is a setting in Peace that can do the same thing?

[2023-01-05 02:16:03] <Tdski> it just sounds like an agressive compressor

[2023-01-05 02:22:11] <+shmitty7> when i turn dts on, i cant hear discord through my headset. know a fix?
[2023-01-05 02:22:16] <TheMechanicTTV> @dabsNbrews like headphone style?
[2023-01-05 02:22:26] <Chum964> Damn. Guess I've got some trouble shooting to do.

[2023-01-05 02:22:33] <%RemState> @Klean goxlr should be able to drive your 250 ohms btw. I run the same headphones directly
[2023-01-05 02:22:38] <LLUKEEX> is DTS free?
[2023-01-05 02:22:39] <kermithefrag> my bussy uses in ear monitors for headphones and they were not producing 3d audio at all. he had to switch to his old head phones to hear directionaly
[2023-01-05 02:22:39] <+pineappled1ck> Agreed, gives you the ability to turn it to whatever volume you want
[2023-01-05 02:22:40] <+shmitty7> got it. thanks
[2023-01-05 02:22:41] <%Kettix> The DTS Headphone:X is not on store because you need to pay for it. I get info for it when starting DTS

[2023-01-05 02:23:08] <TheMechanicTTV> or do you mean like earplugs?
[2023-01-05 02:23:15] <%+Comrade_Sneak> Nutty foo foo scav times for me
[2023-01-05 02:23:18] <JEWLEE> YES THEYRE LONG QUEUES
[2023-01-05 02:23:18] [Notification] Torqology subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 29 month streak!
[2023-01-05 02:23:19] <%frank_g111> no they were 3 mins earlier for me
[2023-01-05 02:23:20] <+DJxLIGHT> I waited 10 minutes for one, and died in 2 minutes.
[2023-01-05 02:23:21] <!%SourSweet> I think I've only done 1 scav run this entire wipe because of queue times hahaha
[2023-01-05 02:23:22] <%Summerteeth> yeah, shits fucked
[2023-01-05 02:23:26] <SomaVision> Scavs have been taking like 10+ minutes for the last few days
[2023-01-05 02:23:26] <%+PapaSlurps> so if your headphones/dac support 3D spatial audio, it's typically provided via an app
[2023-01-05 02:23:26] <+pineappled1ck> You did the invite person to lobby 'trick'?
[2023-01-05 02:23:28] <%+Rorviticus> Yo klean! Good evening kleanTef
[2023-01-05 02:23:29] <+og_tr0jan> havent been able to run scav at all
[2023-01-05 02:23:29] <Jeppe_Helt> switch to EU klean, they are very good for you Kappa
[2023-01-05 02:23:32] <+pineappled1ck> Never tried it myself but people say it works well
[2023-01-05 02:23:33] <+drifter_dave> I havent had any trouble getting into a scav raid until today, even with the group thing
[2023-01-05 02:23:33] <+MrFloomp> got in earlier really fast
[2023-01-05 02:23:34] <%+TheVixx> @Klean so you've verified DTS helps with the audio? Missed the conclusion of your experimenting yesterday.
[2023-01-05 02:23:34] <%ArcticHusky> all i have is window sonic rip
[2023-01-05 02:23:38] <%wittinlol> just hit and miss on queue times tbh sometimes straight in sometimes 5-8 minutes
[2023-01-05 02:23:43] <+chrisw0516> once I start making some serious money, I'd like some 64's. theyre so spendy though.
[2023-01-05 02:23:46] <dougconnellypi> @Klean  it would be quieter because of the impedence of the GOXLR output. If you have sennys you can usually buy a power supply for them
[2023-01-05 02:23:50] <inkillawetrust_> uh, if my accounts are linked how do i claim drops
[2023-01-05 02:23:51] <+shmitty7> @pineappled1ck when i downloaded it didnt mention any purchase or trial. says it's licensed though
[2023-01-05 02:23:59] <R1ppCaTT> the shortest scav time Ive had so far has been like 10 minutes
[2023-01-05 02:23:59] <dougconnellypi> Which will increase volume.
[2023-01-05 02:24:02] <+crunkz1z> i've been having sub 2 min load ins on woods and factory, scav and pmc

[2023-01-05 02:24:21] <%+PapaSlurps> @TheVixx Conclusion was that, for him, it greatly improves audio but that it also comes down to preference
[2023-01-05 02:24:24] <+MrFloomp> @inkillawetrust_ via twitch, goes directly to your eft account

[2023-01-05 02:34:38] <%illusion_killz> @Klean is that the "free Trial" DTS you are using or did you buy it?

[2023-01-05 02:35:00] <+wa_mi> agree how are you hearing through concreate
[2023-01-05 02:35:04] <Sakuinaz124> When I heard they will change audio, I had low hopes, and it seems it came true or worse.
[2023-01-05 02:35:05] <%HurricaneFX> At least he said that yesterday

[2023-01-05 02:35:23] <%+stuntedsights> Hello all 👋🏻
[2023-01-05 02:35:26] <%illusion_killz> but its hard out here some times
[2023-01-05 02:35:27] <+RymesWithOrange> I love listening to your view on the game. Very interesting.
[2023-01-05 02:35:28] <hristanya_> Why hasn't BSG fixed those things?
[2023-01-05 02:35:32] <%KrackinWise313> 40 mins of data
[2023-01-05 02:35:38] <PewPewLB> I'd rather wait for a fix than to pay $24.99 for a 3rd party app lmao
[2023-01-05 02:35:38] <+MajorFish50> @Klean seems like they have improved it a bit with muffled sounds. like voip for instance
[2023-01-05 02:35:44] <+jonsliz> audio video drops...when?
[2023-01-05 02:35:45] <+FatherOwens> audio so hard to code
[2023-01-05 02:35:50] <%KrackinWise313> Audio takes a while to fix
[2023-01-05 02:35:58] <ravenousglory> this is "normal" for an infinite beta game didn't you know? lol
[2023-01-05 02:36:00] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> streets rubberbanding. this fucked up audio. they should be on it ASAP

[2023-01-05 02:36:17] <+Finaltrap22> and for int specifically the audio needs to reverb back through vertical passageways like escalators or the hole, because the floor is concrete, it shouldn't go through the floor at all, and minimally on other maps too

[2023-01-05 02:38:29] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> does BSG usually do midwipe updates?
[2023-01-05 02:38:30] <%illusion_killz> @Klean is that DTS gunna be a sub base thing or one time deal ?
[2023-01-05 02:38:31] <+Doctor7Death> @Klean how do you get multiple options for the headset audio in windows?
[2023-01-05 02:38:38] <+HotelTwoFive> crackers would've sufficed.

[2023-01-05 02:39:03] <+FatherOwens> it's almost as if bsg coded this game one way and got to a point where it was too late to actually do it correctly so now they have spaghetti code
[2023-01-05 02:39:09] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> Klean bro. appreciate you. always responding
[2023-01-05 02:39:14] <+leonesoulace> scav bros
[2023-01-05 02:39:20] <+sickmovement> @Klean is there an eq for dts sound or is it just a turn on/off kind of deal
[2023-01-05 02:39:25] <%illusion_killz> LOL
[2023-01-05 02:39:26] <%+RatPhd> @ravenousglory All Unity games are written in C#. Unity provides the engine for physics, audio, etc, but you can expand upon them yourself if you so please.
[2023-01-05 02:39:34] <%ToxikToad> Lies
[2023-01-05 02:39:34] <%+NeWkLeaR1992> thats understandable
[2023-01-05 02:39:35] <+BrewtusMaloney> wait, does DTS help audio in the game?
[2023-01-05 02:39:36] <%ToxikToad> Lol

[2023-01-05 02:39:49] <Chris114> he doesn't ignore us
[2023-01-05 02:39:49] <ravenousglory> I bet it will took them about 2 months to fix audio. Few wipes ago there was a bug with audio in east wing on shoreline and it took 1.5 months to fix it
[2023-01-05 02:39:49] <+Spacejamming> True @KrackinWise313 Sadge
[2023-01-05 02:39:52] <%illusion_killz> right

[2023-01-05 02:41:40] <%+RatPhd> @ravenousglory They probably extended the engine and have bugs, or did not use a unity feature the way it was intended. Hard to really tell without having access to the code

[2023-01-05 03:14:42] <mf_Cardano> lol
[2023-01-05 03:14:50] <Futurewolves> yeah but 75 is op
[2023-01-05 03:14:55] <%nalluska> theres so much complains about the audio again.. I mean yes it takes time to get used to and its weird sometimes or most of the times but atleast we hear vertical Sounds now witch is mostly good thing and I prefer this than the old one. Just needs more tweaking.

[2023-01-05 03:22:00] <Kotva_> I feel like that FPS heavily depends on server as well, i got stable 60-70, but sometimes like 40 , when I have this low amount, server usually desyncs by a lot

[2023-01-05 03:31:16] <LiquidTell> the more vocal a scav the more aim bot they are
[2023-01-05 03:31:26] <%TheWalkingDad263> scavs are fun to fight now..not just some dumb target like before
[2023-01-05 03:31:38] <Mastoner20> The red sleeve scavs I swear are insta aimbot.

[2023-01-05 04:53:33] <fennyszn> @ForeverAloneHero idk im just terrible in every aspect of this game lmfao
[2023-01-05 04:53:35] <%+Mischowski> good old Hatchling runs
[2023-01-05 04:53:38] <%bog512> I remember watching sequisha farm people on hatchet factory runs
[2023-01-05 04:53:44] <MoonRoccs> hatchlings were everywhere in 3 years ago. reserve was a rat race seqKEK
[2023-01-05 04:53:45] <kayenby> @xxterribadxx turn off binaural and restart your game every so often. there seems to be a bad memory leak atm
[2023-01-05 04:53:51] <%ForeverAloneHero> same @fennyszn
[2023-01-05 04:54:01] <+xxterribadxx> @xxterribadxx wait for real? its that simple?
[2023-01-05 04:54:08] <%+PapaSlurps> Do you have any thoughts on how to handle late game gear goliaths? The best part of the wipe always seems to be the start for most people.
[2023-01-05 04:54:20] <%+Fade691> oh crap some how i created 3X Klean stream... be back after the purge\
[2023-01-05 04:54:29] <kayenby> probably part of it, tarkov is more cpu heavy than other games so make sure thats working well too
[2023-01-05 04:54:31] <+AgyntSmyth> That is how trained operators use weapons in CQB, stock over the shoulder extending when in open space.  Pretty easy with bit of training.
[2023-01-05 04:54:33] <+Silvia240> @xxterribadxx sometimes yeah
[2023-01-05 04:54:38] <+countryttv> @xxterribadxx if you’re using binaural restart the game every couple raids. Bad memory leak

[2023-01-05 05:13:54] <+qDrFaustp> Did that scav end up being a bad scav in ur previous scav raid?
[2023-01-05 05:13:57] <%Zenonoke> isn't it generally better to toggle lean and then peak quickly?
[2023-01-05 05:14:04] <@%JaxPC> @KARMERICAN some benefits though, martial arts and baseball and i think hockey has over representation of lefties 5Head
[2023-01-05 05:14:08] <avalanchelight> I remember before, I had the option to Q/E lean 2-3x fast. Now it slowly leans to position.

[2023-01-05 05:56:00] <strongbox> they should put radiation near exits. it would serve as an indicator where the exit is and help prevent exit campers
[2023-01-05 05:56:01] <NotSam> Was the stock fold a misclick? Or just fiddling with the weapon?

[2023-01-05 06:30:20] <%ForsaikenRedskye> oh there's supposedly going to be a berserker boss on streets klean
[2023-01-05 06:30:32] <+Vaynardlifts> such bad timing
[2023-01-05 06:30:38] <+NotAGank> so tired of running into 3 and 4 mans
[2023-01-05 06:30:39] <+Bignaaaasty> is it just me or is it insanely hard to pinpoint where this guy is? I'm wearing headphones but sometimes hes to the right sometimes hes right in front. its so weird. does he have binaural audio on?

[2023-01-05 06:31:05] <pixzrr> This fight taking way to long
[2023-01-05 06:31:09] [Announcement] <Nightbot> Twitter: https://bit.ly/3phjP7U | Instagram: https://bit.ly/2kiwiuo | TikTok: https://bit.ly/3PpXnnI | YouTube: https://bit.ly/3Ak7Nkv
[2023-01-05 06:31:12] <+rcjayy> @Bignaaaasty an easy trick is too free look and whatever headphone they are louder in is the side they are on
[2023-01-05 06:31:17] <boogiepopppu> @Bignaaaasty I get this a lot too esp ingame. i can never tell where sounds come from
[2023-01-05 06:31:20] <Randomguypi> @Two_Hands idk, but i wouldn't be surprised with how technology has improved
[2023-01-05 06:31:27] <+TwitchyJoe> Yeah the occlusion is wack
[2023-01-05 06:31:28] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @pixzrr do you rush or not?
[2023-01-05 06:31:33] <+Bignaaaasty> @rcjayy Yea that's what I usually do but it's just annoying.
[2023-01-05 06:31:35] <boogiepopppu> could be your headphones though
[2023-01-05 06:31:40] <immenaj> isnt there 2
[2023-01-05 06:31:41] <+rcjayy> @Bignaaaasty i agree
[2023-01-05 06:31:48] <+Vaynardlifts> a wipe with no in game headsets would be great. Even audio across the playing field without hearing people down the street
[2023-01-05 06:31:49] <kaos_v> @Two_Hands Big difference is the focus. Being able to see this clear, you can't see anything withing 6 feet of you clearly
[2023-01-05 06:31:53] <LittleSosig95> It's a shipment container right?
[2023-01-05 06:31:54] <@%JaxPC> @Two_Hands kind of? they're optical so resolution isn't a thing really, but there's significant visual noise
[2023-01-05 06:31:59] <+Dateff> fix left arm first :D
[2023-01-05 06:32:11] <Nimraah> what Lv is Klean atm ?

[2023-01-05 06:32:21] <+veiled_nomad> 2nd person i've ever heard say connex box, everyone else says seacan
[2023-01-05 06:32:26] <tewbs> @Nimraah 29 iirc
[2023-01-05 06:32:28] <Akozron> LUL
[2023-01-05 06:32:30] <Randomguypi> wish there was some kind of IFF you can stick on headgear
[2023-01-05 06:32:31] <+Bignaaaasty> @boogiepopppu or me lol. I don't really have this issue with something like COD or CS though so my abilities are 'Fine?" maybe It just doesn;t click for me in this game
[2023-01-05 06:32:39] <Kaviji> theres something about having virtual surround enabled on your PC that helps a lot with the audio. its that or some other setting that virtualizes surround sound to stereo. sequisha discovered it earlier today, made his audio night and day better
[2023-01-05 06:32:42] <Nimraah> @tewbs Cheers bud o/
[2023-01-05 06:32:46] <+viperwolfpanda> I say storage container. TIL lol
[2023-01-05 06:32:47] <%ForsaikenRedskye> seqChat imagine taking your time in a fire fight... RIGHT
[2023-01-05 06:32:51] <+OlBoyGoose> @veiled_nomad lol I say shipping containers

[2023-01-05 06:33:04] <%McGlowhawk> Connex for sure
[2023-01-05 06:33:07] <+vigilant647> hes pinned
[2023-01-05 06:33:10] <Randomguypi> inb4 someone steals his backpack during all this
[2023-01-05 06:33:34] <+Bignaaaasty> @Vaynardlifts I wish in general audio was WAY toned down. Can never sneak up on people. Playstyles are either sit still or rush and the audio is a big factor in that.
[2023-01-05 06:33:51] <+veiled_nomad> @veiled_nomad i've only just heard connex box this year and been in an industrial industry we use them in all the time for 20 years
[2023-01-05 06:34:09] <Randomguypi> that surgery does NOT sound pleasant
[2023-01-05 06:34:13] <+m00nman559> @veiled_nomad right? or ven containers
[2023-01-05 06:34:13] <+idoitforthepub> Just finished a raid with a blacked out head.. Did not know that was possible.
[2023-01-05 06:34:16] <tsiigaaja> damn theyre still breeding
[2023-01-05 06:34:16] <+Bignaaaasty> Why I love fog/rain. I can come up on a guy. Also love going against squads for that reason. Ran right up on 3 and 4 mans cause they didnt realize my footsteps werent their teams

[2023-01-05 06:34:21] <SevenTruths> @Randomguypi Wouldn't an IFF just turn your head into a giant signal light for anyone else wearing NVG's when on?
[2023-01-05 06:34:22] <+Vaynardlifts> @Vaynardlifts yeah i mean you have to use headsets or you cuck yourself but honestly audio without them would be better

[2023-01-05 06:34:43] <Randomguypi> @SevenTruths true

[2023-01-05 06:54:54] <%Nasty_Nate91> @Randomguypi  and if its low enough scavs aggro on you on sight when you play as a scav

[2023-01-05 06:56:07] <%Nasty_Nate91> @Randomguypi killing  pmcs as a scav... taking car exttracts as pmc... and you get 0.01 i think for every succesful scav extract
[2023-01-05 06:56:20] <448Grxms> lol good question, i dont think most do
[2023-01-05 06:56:40] <%Nasty_Nate91> @Randomguypi  you get a decent amount of scav rep if you exit with a pmc on a coop extract like on reserve or woods

[2023-01-05 07:25:10] <Randomguypi> somone way saynig you need to aim those irons from the middle not the tip
[2023-01-05 07:25:10] <%KevinSredz> @Klean no rear-sight, so you have to aim at the middle of the front post
[2023-01-05 07:25:12] <+chillyc13> Oo he was a scav… so didn’t have heals…

[2023-01-05 07:26:20] <%KevinSredz> @vigilant647 be prepared. Cheapest version is the most unforgiving
[2023-01-05 07:26:20] <+GingerBinger> @vigilant647 that level 1 stash is brutal

[2023-01-05 07:26:25] <%ForsaikenRedskye> just need a fresh lower is all.
[2023-01-05 07:26:30] <+chillyc13> @randomguypi  Gotcha I came in way late and didn’t know he was scaving so was confused why he wasn’t healing then saw he was scaving so it made sense

[2023-01-05 07:26:57] <+Rikaku49> @Klean for iron sights that have a straight piece vertical, should you aim with the bottom or the top of the vertical piece?

[2023-01-05 07:29:37] <silentspook> lol
[2023-01-05 07:29:41] <%ZenobiCat> Don't they still need to optimize the new sound system though?
[2023-01-05 07:29:54] <+Tlomz27> if bina functioned properly id turn it on, until then im good
[2023-01-05 07:30:04] <mrclean12> @OlBoyGoose yup

[2023-01-05 07:30:17] <+FoxKnot_> From my experience binaural does help identifying front and back sounds but the poor quality of the engine itself just doesn't help
[2023-01-05 07:30:29] <Kosmicosis> to me it is still better than Steam, since Steam caused hundreds if not thousands of sound dead zones

[2023-01-05 07:30:38] <%darcss> good morning
[2023-01-05 07:30:40] <Overcast22> Steam audio in its entirety can fix that. But sadly no more for tarky… like hunt showdown for example is the full implementation of steam audio.

[2023-01-05 07:31:05] <+Rikaku49> @Klean for iron sights that have a vertical piece in the middle like the sks, is the bullet hitting the top of the vertical piece or the bottom?

[2023-01-05 07:31:33] <+Balltr0city> The audio, from a directional standpoint is better when you arent wearing any ears.

[2023-01-05 08:04:17] <moravahn> they waste my time gating tasks that I could have complete by now and would like to have complete because I can't play all day
[2023-01-05 08:04:29] <+RuggedxGhost> I have tried loading into a scab raid a couple times today for me to wait 7-8 mins then it just kicks me to the main menu. Anyone else have this happen to them?

[2023-01-05 08:48:51] <cancerous_reply> Bro search bear fight on youtube and if you think a gorilla stands any chance youre delusional, only thing that stands a chance is a lion/tiger by bleeding the bear, but the lion/tiger would still prob die if bear fought back

[2023-01-05 09:54:51] <jkingx707> did he pick it up
[2023-01-05 09:54:53] <+SummitVotedTrump> svd guard monkaS

[2023-01-05 09:55:00] <knoxxc> monkaS
[2023-01-05 09:55:02] <akaBlackbeard> THATS a scary guard
[2023-01-05 09:55:06] <Mr_Pleebo> sr
[2023-01-05 09:55:06] <realkrappyyy_> svd
[2023-01-05 09:55:07] <gintonii> sr-25
[2023-01-05 09:55:08] <+OR10N867> Feels like there is no in between Positioning and Engagement, they just go hard for one or the other @Klean
[2023-01-05 09:55:08] <%KevinSredz> sounds like an Sr-25 or G28
[2023-01-05 09:55:09] <2bad2getgud> yeah i honestly do feel like the game is slightly going backwards as they try to do more to the game
[2023-01-05 09:55:09] <+Mulesy95> hunter?
[2023-01-05 09:55:10] <%ForsaikenRedskye> no it's a SVD klean
[2023-01-05 09:55:15] <+apctv> @sakuinaz124  must practice head shots in their free time lol
[2023-01-05 09:55:16] <%+Chuck_It> Sounded like an SVD

[2023-01-05 09:55:20] <%KevinSredz> @ForsaikenRedskye its 100% not an SVD
[2023-01-05 09:55:24] <%Boub0ule> RFB i believe
[2023-01-05 09:55:25] <LitD420> sounded like svd
[2023-01-05 09:55:29] <gintonii> guards have sr-25 sometimes
[2023-01-05 09:55:30] <+tk_kingzx> 545 short maybe
[2023-01-05 09:55:31] <+Molloc> CarlSmile
[2023-01-05 09:55:33] <KeinHerz> it is NOT svd
[2023-01-05 09:55:33] <+serial_bus> imo AI in a shooter is probably the hardest thing to get right in game design, never really seen it done well ever. AI in an FPS is never fun to kill, and one of the most frustrating things to get killed by
[2023-01-05 09:55:34] <+SoggyDev> def sr-25

[2023-01-05 09:58:01] <+serial_bus> @SamuraiSavv maybe tarkov gets away with it because bosses loot and stuff that gives them some purpose of being in the game but other than that it just feels like bloat and cheap as hell when you die to ai for no reason, they can only ever be pointless or literal aimbots that are annoying to die to

[2023-01-05 10:00:26] <DeathDeclined> i like how smoke goes into raid and builds a gun pretty cool
[2023-01-05 10:00:31] <+JBreezy_97> I enjoy early wipe building guns from FIR attachments
[2023-01-05 10:00:34] <+casper_fps> yeah the traders are almost more op than the flea market

[2023-01-05 10:00:40] <%KevinSredz> in-raid traders would change the economy soooo much
[2023-01-05 10:00:47] <%Torabisu420> Get me that treadmill to level endurance and I’m in.
[2023-01-05 10:00:57] <+WicckdUniverse> more trader levels seems like the best approach
[2023-01-05 10:00:58] <+hoetakuu> the parts ingame are too scarce to warrant that. building guns would be near impossible

[2023-01-05 10:06:54] <swearrzz> how many gujnsmiths can we do per 24hr?
[2023-01-05 10:07:04] <+Pibbs__> why do you think people have such stigmas against scaving?
[2023-01-05 10:07:16] <vengeful17> Dude i came back to eft cause a buddy asked me to play with him, and first scav raid i found a sledge hammer lol
[2023-01-05 10:07:42] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> Only time I found another PMC willing to talk it out was on woods. We were both doing Shootout Picnic
[2023-01-05 10:07:46] <ShugokiNerf> @Pibbs__ I'm the opposite, when I play tarkov I love scavs so much that I level them more than my pmc

[2023-01-05 10:08:29] <+aybird> isnt that the point of the game tho in the current state?
[2023-01-05 10:08:49] <%+Zoixy> Hmm FAL
[2023-01-05 10:08:50] <%+aamef> People don't seem to like that others enjoy scavving @Pibbs__ - Maybe because it's "free gear", and you don't risk anything. You basically BET 0$ and can win $1m
[2023-01-05 10:08:59] <+JeebieBeebies> @aybird Yeah, that's kinda the problem
[2023-01-05 10:08:59] <%+aamef> No risk, but loads of reward type of thing.
[2023-01-05 10:09:01] <+Shukiden> @klean exact reason I quit every wipe, I’ve got the best stuff always it’s just boring and loot is boring then also
[2023-01-05 10:09:28] <jooganxm> bad player scavs are absolute bastards lmao
[2023-01-05 10:09:33] <ShugokiNerf> I like scavs because you spawn in later and it can be way more chaotic as you dont know who's where, and the loot feels way more random (havent played in over a year)
[2023-01-05 10:09:42] <%+WizzerOne> whats that stim do? havent seen iit yet

[2023-01-05 10:17:32] <weizen666> Still no updates on arena huh
[2023-01-05 10:17:33] <jesusdr1nk> Tarkov by far is the only game that has pumped me with so much adrenaline that my hands are shaking when I kill 4 ppl
[2023-01-05 10:17:40] <+TiredBoiTV> i feel like alot of pvp is luck
[2023-01-05 10:17:45] <ShugokiNerf> pepeD ValHammer
[2023-01-05 10:17:45] <%ssellevol> brothers, how do you find motitvation to play games?
[2023-01-05 10:17:45] <+Teebo_GG> @KaEx_TV Kyoto sound is the name i think
[2023-01-05 10:17:49] [Raid] 25 raiders from DesmondPilak have joined!

[2023-01-05 10:17:57] <+sle_sle23> finally getting some good raids after 2 days
[2023-01-05 10:18:01] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> What I did my first wipe was only PMC on one or two maps. Wouldn't recommend it. Gotta get rid of that gear fear
[2023-01-05 10:18:02] <+Narco559> got 120 rounds of ps 545 for my rare....
[2023-01-05 10:18:02] <+sle_sle23> night reserve is the move
[2023-01-05 10:18:03] <%Torabisu420> My favorite thing for scav is going factory. Haven’t seen a single pmc for like 10 runs in there. It’s just a big scav party every time.
[2023-01-05 10:18:10] <%blacknblue_0369> @Klean what unit were you with?

[2023-01-05 10:19:13] <@%DesmondPilak> a known fact
[2023-01-05 10:19:15] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> For new players I'd recommend saving scav knives to barter for an MP5 or UMP-45. SMG full auto is easy af to control
[2023-01-05 10:19:27] <mojden> @DesmondPilak Same brother
[2023-01-05 10:19:33] <%+the_footlessmage> lol funk is badass

[2023-01-05 10:20:47] <Ukko00> yeah I am missing some footsteps while my friends can hear them without issue
[2023-01-05 10:21:02] <+Kerev2112> Audio this wipe is so incredibly confusing it makes me paranoid
[2023-01-05 10:21:03] <+MotorNippon> Vertical sound still mess up as well
[2023-01-05 10:21:04] <Oi_da> @BoyThatsMyMeat yes
[2023-01-05 10:21:07] <+Narco559> @BoyThatsMyMeat ther is an auto claim extension on chrome
[2023-01-05 10:21:14] <+macki___> so what do you do, just turn on virtual surround sound?
[2023-01-05 10:21:15] <avxt1n> is this your own phonk playlist??
[2023-01-05 10:21:17] <weizen666> Vert sound is def wacky af
[2023-01-05 10:21:24] <jesusdr1nk> I don’t like how close footsteps can sound but they are still shockingly far away, it’s hard to calibrate my brain to it
[2023-01-05 10:21:26] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> @Oi_da lit
[2023-01-05 10:21:26] <%ForsaikenRedskye> i agree klean
[2023-01-05 10:21:30] <Tshcktall> i tried both dts and atmos now. I'm sticking with atmos. thx klean for this.
[2023-01-05 10:21:41] <Axyom7> Was the new audio tested on the ETS at all?
[2023-01-05 10:21:42] <%coconutsquatch> that's almost every update though
[2023-01-05 10:21:44] <%+Howdi__> very true
[2023-01-05 10:21:48] <knoxxc> pepeD
[2023-01-05 10:21:51] <+Smiithereens> my game has run worse than ever this wipe... and im on a 3080 now
[2023-01-05 10:21:54] <juanwiccc> Anyone else have a scav spawn near them with no sound and head eyes :(
[2023-01-05 10:21:56] <justcarbunkle> between the audio and the scavs I don't know what got worse
[2023-01-05 10:22:04] <glappie> You think it's the lack of experience and Nikita's unwillingles to hire outside of Russia?
[2023-01-05 10:22:15] <TheOzzyTex> you miss dark and darker thats it dont lie

[2023-01-05 10:22:21] <ShugokiNerf> FeelsRainMan
[2023-01-05 10:22:22] <+Papi_Devito> this update seems pretty bad for performance, like 20-30 fps less than 2 wipes ago i last played
[2023-01-05 10:22:24] <glappie> ok :)
[2023-01-05 10:22:26] <%1PitchPeter> I want arena so bad dude
[2023-01-05 10:22:27] <hacme> I am already burned out by scav head eyes.
[2023-01-05 10:22:31] <BUZZpunk> DTS with HRTF doesn't really make sense from a tech perspective. It's two clashing techs. Will end up with a lot of misplaced sfx
[2023-01-05 10:22:34] <adimpower> @smiithereens i play with a 2060 and got 100fps on customs, streets around 55
[2023-01-05 10:22:46] <%Swako21> @Papi_Devito binaurial sound tanks performance, turn it off if you havent already
[2023-01-05 10:22:47] <hennessyxy> Adapt New Play Style?
[2023-01-05 10:22:49] <DontBeShyGG> !setup
[2023-01-05 10:22:56] <%coconutsquatch> i mean it could be to some extend...smaller reasons, with main ones being number of devs and just outdated engine for what their vision is?
[2023-01-05 10:23:01] <+SoggyDev> did they buff helmets? i feel like im getting saved by my helmet almost every raid
[2023-01-05 10:23:02] <SkySt0n3> I just want to enjoy pvp again
[2023-01-05 10:23:03] <Blackwell0102> squadT
[2023-01-05 10:23:09] <ShugokiNerf> Too much tarkov, klean?
[2023-01-05 10:23:19] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> @Narco559 Thanks man, gonna download that extension for sure
[2023-01-05 10:23:21] <+z0mbzz> This is my first wipe ever and It's very enjoyable as a first time player but the sound is pretty jank.
[2023-01-05 10:23:23] <Unbe> F timing
[2023-01-05 10:23:25] <Unbe> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 10:23:26] <+Papi_Devito> @Papi_Devito i did, just a bit better
[2023-01-05 10:23:29] <+kyle00429> they need to fix the comtechs
[2023-01-05 10:23:30] <+Smiithereens> @adimpower bro idk whats good ive tried like 30 solutions but i cant run streets online at more than 65 frames consistently
[2023-01-05 10:23:32] <%Boub0ule> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 10:23:34] <+MotorNippon> Looks like I choose a bad timing to join EFT community ! I guess just roll with punches .
[2023-01-05 10:23:38] <+mr_masta87> Well helps all sounds besides the rain, still loud as shit lol
[2023-01-05 10:23:48] <+ViddyWeII> What is comtax
[2023-01-05 10:23:49] <+Smiithereens> @adimpower 1440p obviously, but offline im gettin 100+ fps
[2023-01-05 10:23:53] <+King_Burns> That used to be the grind early wipe
[2023-01-05 10:23:53] <Fallenx54> I would like it if they added more quests but made the quests you get more random, so you always feel like you have to do sth different even as your buddy
[2023-01-05 10:23:55] <Revixy> thought it was just me lol
[2023-01-05 10:23:55] <BUZZpunk> Yeah agreed, should remove them until audio is fixed
[2023-01-05 10:23:56] <+King_Burns> To unlock headsets
[2023-01-05 10:24:00] <avxt1n> @MotorNippon its been worse keep going
[2023-01-05 10:24:02] <%DRMALIKIA> nothing like EFT making 90% of their community deaf for trying to hear foot steps kleanWow
[2023-01-05 10:24:08] <extimate> Have BSG have said anything publicly about the newer, post-patch sound issues?
[2023-01-05 10:24:09] <adimpower> @smiithereens damn somthing wrong with you ram or something
[2023-01-05 10:24:13] <juanwiccc> @soggydev I think so - I’ve been saved like 6 times by helmets in 30 raids
[2023-01-05 10:24:16] <%Boub0ule> maybe they should remove tacs  for the time being
[2023-01-05 10:24:17] VIEWERS: 10 214
[2023-01-05 10:24:20] <+TiredBoiTV> @Klean comtacs or helmets?
[2023-01-05 10:24:22] <aranzaboi> headphones are too op
[2023-01-05 10:24:24] <+King_Burns> Comtacs and other headsets used to be difficult to get
[2023-01-05 10:24:26] <akaBlackbeard> GSSh are my fav,   Comtac 2 are worse for me for some reason
[2023-01-05 10:24:28] <adimpower> @smiithereens iam on 1440 to
[2023-01-05 10:24:28] <%Torabisu420> Lemme take my boots off and do some rag foot wraps.
[2023-01-05 10:24:28] <+SoTT1cK> The stream frooze... So I should not be using comtacs? I missed half of it.
[2023-01-05 10:24:31] <%coconutsquatch> sneaking up was an issue before....i mean, from clips they use for different moving speeds on different surfaces, to sound going through what should be solid concrete....
[2023-01-05 10:24:33] <Stephiroy> Id say remove them alltogether imo
[2023-01-05 10:24:39] <bangalore8me> stealthing hasn't been a thing since like halfway through last wipe its just gotten alot worse its useless to try and sneak anymore
[2023-01-05 10:24:40] <+Kripplher> @DRMALIKIA I started running a software compressor last wipe lol
[2023-01-05 10:24:42] <Ukko00> oh ai can definitely hear the difference in footsteps
[2023-01-05 10:24:42] <%Swako21> @Papi_Devito helped me a lot
[2023-01-05 10:24:46] <+Smiithereens> @adimpower i dont think so bro every test and every other game runs fine :/

[2023-01-05 10:25:03] <weizen666> Damn
[2023-01-05 10:25:09] <Ukko00> anybody using JBL Quantum Engine for the surround audio?
[2023-01-05 10:25:13] <+macki___> so comtacs the way to go this wipe?

[2023-01-05 10:25:26] <jesusdr1nk> Even if I could sneak up on someone, I feel like they hear me anyways cas I sound like I’m walking on a layer of pringles everywhere I go
[2023-01-05 10:25:32] <danbruhhdan> Huh Klean that video about fov is intriguing , certainly good idea when issuing 1x optics
[2023-01-05 10:25:33] <glappie> I played as a scav the other day, no headset, he was 2-3 meters from me and i heard NOTHING before he shot me
[2023-01-05 10:25:35] <+Smiithereens> @adimpower something clearly wrong and if i dont restart my game after like 3 runs on streets im down to 50 fps
[2023-01-05 10:25:37] <%DRMALIKIA> @Kripplher Legit, Whisper me that shit about to pass out.
[2023-01-05 10:25:38] <z_o_m_33> what about the other headsets?
[2023-01-05 10:25:38] <sighsaac> Comtacs have always been essential, but never more so than they are now
[2023-01-05 10:25:39] <+RebelFoxtrot> yeah audio camping is one of the worst parts of this game imo
[2023-01-05 10:25:43] <weizen666> @jesusdr1nk lmfaoo
[2023-01-05 10:25:43] <StrungFX> It’s hard to tell how far someone is with them tho
[2023-01-05 10:25:45] <+LVRaiden> is there a difference between comtacs 2 and 4 ?
[2023-01-05 10:26:02] <adimpower> @smiithereens uninstall and new install maybe
[2023-01-05 10:26:05] <%bourbon_l> I've noticed that alot actually. Stealth is not a thing this wipe anymore Sadge
[2023-01-05 10:26:07] <gregoryiscute> what about gssh's in ur opinion I feel like they are really good
[2023-01-05 10:26:13] <Ukko00> @avxt1n how is it? I have Quantum 300 headphones but didnt try it set

[2023-01-05 10:26:24] <%undistinguishedpeony> @smiithereens yeah there is a memory leak for streets.. restart game after every streets raid to avoif it getting worse
[2023-01-05 10:26:24] <ziltoid_69> I've pretty much only been walking. Running is death
[2023-01-05 10:26:28] <1strum1> comtacs should be more for ear protection than a sound radar. I mean you should get "dazed" from shooting without comtacs or something
[2023-01-05 10:26:40] <%ForsaikenRedskye> talking to scavs now. he's going crazy
[2023-01-05 10:26:42] <Rugaro_> real ones dont that for sure

[2023-01-05 10:34:35] <+impastanoodle> whats that setting
[2023-01-05 10:34:35] <%Dialogue> do you have to tweak any settings?
[2023-01-05 10:34:38] <%+Darka1395> is there less activity at night raids? as in player encounters or is it about the same?
[2023-01-05 10:34:41] <avxt1n> @Paperplanesman i keep getting drops and i havent even been wathcin streams

[2023-01-05 10:35:21] <%coconutsquatch> @Darka1395 depends on how long it has been since the wipe...early on, probably less, later on, more, but still a bit less than day raids
[2023-01-05 10:35:29] <Nutty__1> @reflexez04 worst patch of all time
[2023-01-05 10:35:38] <%ForsaikenRedskye> the only downside is that its only 64Khz 16bit audio.
[2023-01-05 10:35:40] <SevenTruths> @Paperplanesman I just keep a tab open with the drops page and refresh it every now and again to make sure its tracking. You just might be having problems
[2023-01-05 10:35:46] <jesusdr1nk> @darka1395 I find that you get less activity, but there is a higher chance of getting the juiced guy with nods

[2023-01-05 10:39:07] <DeathDeclined> do u think we are just stuck with the current audio issues or you think we will get an update?

[2023-01-05 10:39:15] <jesusdr1nk> Watching doc play is almost cute, he’s so beginner it reminds me of when I started
[2023-01-05 10:39:16] <Panzerftw> im actually havin fun and dont mind the scavs, sucks about the audio tho
[2023-01-05 10:39:16] <+King_Burns> How's it bagging when they're actual observed facts? @KatsuriKuro

[2023-01-05 10:41:10] <ShredLightlyGaming> Anyone else notice that even without binaural the FPS has somehow gotten worse this wipe?
[2023-01-05 10:41:10] <SilverWolfHunter> At this point, im just gonna scav till i find the sledge and get rid of that debuff, im tired of mopping the damn floor
[2023-01-05 10:41:16] <+mr_masta87> I always am a fan of Razr
[2023-01-05 10:41:26] <XiloX> @King_Burns know the dif between opinion and fact?
[2023-01-05 10:41:28] <jesusdr1nk> The game needs to be hardcore but less grindy, to many people think those 2 things are synonymous
[2023-01-05 10:41:31] <%Splint671> Yo Klean how you doing bro? The raids been good?
[2023-01-05 10:41:34] <Geeeeth_AR> @Klean yup !

[2023-01-05 10:41:42] <WheelxFlexLex6> Go woods and you will find sledge asap. Two or three spawns in the scav village

[2023-01-05 10:42:01] <SilverWolfHunter> @RaiderRuiz i know, now up to 6%....
[2023-01-05 10:42:01] <%Splint671> Yeah I’m surprised you’re still at it bro
[2023-01-05 10:42:02] <ravenousglory> @SilverWolfHunter I've found it as a scav but couldn't take it since some smart ass thought its a good idea to make it 10-fucking slot long

[2023-01-05 10:42:45] <+MotorNippon> Is there any other DTS programs for pc out side microsoft store ????
[2023-01-05 10:42:46] <%wittinlol> comtacts need nerf. atm I can track a player 200m away walking
[2023-01-05 10:42:52] <KatsuriKuro> of course I do but saying it in another streamers chat is not the way to do that @King_Burns

[2023-01-05 10:42:56] <MvrkZS> yeah headsets make you hear so far away its confusing when someone gets close

[2023-01-05 10:43:07] <ravenousglory> @wittinlol 200m what?
[2023-01-05 10:43:11] <+Beaver_II> it must be difficult to balance audio with all the different headsets
[2023-01-05 10:43:17] <PutinIsSmallAndBald> @wittinlol its not comtac problem its shit fucking audio
[2023-01-05 10:43:17] <+arthiXYZ> hey guys, do we know how Klean fixed the fishbowly sound with DTS?
[2023-01-05 10:43:21] <+Cutive_> @Klean u said u had a fix for audio on twitter, u mind sharing?
[2023-01-05 10:43:22] <+King_Burns> So then how should you? @KatsuriKuro
[2023-01-05 10:43:27] <%ForsaikenRedskye> time to stop using comtacs LUL
[2023-01-05 10:43:29] <spypilot> Shouldn’t the comtacs cancel gunshots? Isn’t that what they are for?
[2023-01-05 10:43:32] <+RukkuZ10110> @Klean Damn, sucks to hear. Yeah ik it was a while ago but just was curious if it ever happened.
[2023-01-05 10:43:45] <jesusdr1nk> Not to ‘realism’, but I’m assuming irl headsets don’t let you hear walking from 200m out?
[2023-01-05 10:43:46] <Axyom7> @Cutive_ Think he said a video would be out soon
[2023-01-05 10:43:51] <$Atix00> @spypilot in real life they're made to tune out certain sounds
[2023-01-05 10:43:54] <+mr_masta87> I feel like without them, you get more immersed in the game and have to focus more
[2023-01-05 10:44:15] <+Cutive_> @Cutive_ ik he said vid but audio been pissing me off now just want to fix it quick lol

[2023-01-05 10:45:28] <KatsuriKuro> I dont know how to answer that but I think that streamers chats should be focused on that streamer and not another is all @King_Burns

[2023-01-05 10:50:06] <%bourbon_l> Its always surprising when people rage in this. My friend group is really bad for it. Like bro...part of the game is dying
[2023-01-05 10:50:08] <DokterMelkpak> I've my moments that I lose everything till the last drop, but I still continue. Thats what I love about tarkov
[2023-01-05 10:50:09] <Unbe> Wait, you're supposed to use the meta stuff and not just keep it until next wipe?

[2023-01-05 10:50:32] <SleeperForever> if queue was not so long, it would be less frustrating to die randomly in start of raid :)
[2023-01-05 10:50:35] <+Kripplher> I find that I how much I care about dying is directly related to how long the queues are. If they are over 5 minutes I start getting aggravated
[2023-01-05 10:50:38] <+hoetakuu> if you use shit gear it's worth insuring, you'll almost always get it back

[2023-01-05 11:07:23] <madlycactus1> was interchage one of the maps with "fixed" audio?
[2023-01-05 11:07:23] <%23rubel> im baffled they released it like this. is it because they want to collect data ?
[2023-01-05 11:07:23] <TekarukiteCZ> did they nerf the .45 FMJ pen?
[2023-01-05 11:07:29] <ziltoid_69> @Torabisu420 Nice, yea just craft them. you can get the humpbacks for the car meds in the food isles of Goshan

[2023-01-05 11:07:38] <retrosynth97> yeah those shots were actually from terminal YEP

[2023-01-05 11:07:45] <+Obscurus5713> @Torabisu420 i found 2 as scav in streets, and crackhouse in customs i saw some
[2023-01-05 11:07:49] <ziltoid_69> @Torabisu420 Big rig, no bag extract. Load up on humpack and boogy
[2023-01-05 11:08:08] <%obedezuu> 45 too strong imo.
[2023-01-05 11:08:19] <PimpMyWiki> Just buff 9mm a tad

[2023-01-05 11:08:24] <sid1988> Yea they did
[2023-01-05 11:08:25] <%RagingLoony> Would love some info from the devs on a patch. Audio is atrocious and scavs are insane
[2023-01-05 11:08:26] <TekarukiteCZ> Cuz I hit a guy with .45 FMJ 14 times and the guy didn't care at all
[2023-01-05 11:08:27] <Taohaka> You could have so much fun with this audio. Just sit in basement and yeall  someones ear
[2023-01-05 11:08:28] VIEWERS: 10 352
[2023-01-05 11:08:30] <%wittinlol> they moved the AP to PK3 which is decent at least. I was shredding with that last wipe
[2023-01-05 11:08:35] <+crackalackinTV> Games can pretty much never fix “right in front of you” and “right behind you” sounding the same. The do the same in IRL, but tour ear can detect the difference because of your earlobes. But everything else? Jeez, I think they just can’t do a proper sound propagation across the entire map, so it sounds all choppy and weird
[2023-01-05 11:08:42] <+bencoveney77> 9mm vs fn57 which is nastier
[2023-01-05 11:08:45] <PimpMyWiki> I thought 9mm blew the lungs straight out of the body KEKW
[2023-01-05 11:08:49] <%obedezuu> It needs a tad more pen*
[2023-01-05 11:08:50] <+SoggyDev> i think garandthumb made a video on 9mm vs 45
[2023-01-05 11:08:51] <wackle> whats your take on bill c21
[2023-01-05 11:08:51] <%Daco1> dude I watched garand thumbs video on 9mm and .45 was super interesting and learned a lot
[2023-01-05 11:08:53] <+Afromanash> where can i find an awl??? Ive been looking for dats
[2023-01-05 11:08:58] <+spillysoup> 45 is a slow mover, 9mm is a bit faster
[2023-01-05 11:09:01] <Jimmy__Ricard> and its super accessable
[2023-01-05 11:09:04] <+Bravenheart> did they nerf fmj?
[2023-01-05 11:09:05] <Saro4president> @Klean are you playing with binaural atm?

[2023-01-05 11:09:18] <%+EzPickenz1> 10mm would be dope
[2023-01-05 11:09:20] <+LordPelto> @daco1 garand thumb videos are the best

[2023-01-05 11:10:37] <Hermando77> @Klean Does binaural audio make the audio better or worse right now?
[2023-01-05 11:10:50] <Djpjmana1> true i still use ump with ap all wipe
[2023-01-05 11:10:57] <ziltoid_69> kinda weird the UMP is cheaper than an MP5...
[2023-01-05 11:10:58] <+bencoveney77> is the fn57 any good in this game?

[2023-01-05 11:11:21] <Geeeeth_AR> i am sorry if i am being obnoxious , but please Mr @klean if you can make a Duo tactical gameplay a regular thing on YT (like a series ). you are the only player i know who plays like that and i find that content cool , really interesting and unique . i am sure i am not the only one .  wish you all the best Mr strimr : )
[2023-01-05 11:11:21] <aranzaboi> binural audio seems like placebo option
[2023-01-05 11:11:26] <+Dawn72> fn57 is a very good pistol
[2023-01-05 11:11:26] <+Nainjaa> we would see way less ump if there was no knife trade for it. making it too accessible
[2023-01-05 11:11:26] <%bourbon_l> @bencoveney77 Ohhh buddy. That shit slaps
[2023-01-05 11:11:31] <%Swako21> @bencoveney77 yes, ammo penetration is good for a pistol
[2023-01-05 11:11:34] <+im_audi> this music reminds me of those Dr Livesy csgo meme videos

[2023-01-05 11:11:58] <TrixieKat> well for those like me that it's bugged it's not placebo, the audio cuts and doubles alot and lowers fps
[2023-01-05 11:12:01] <+DebianLSX> @Klean Should BSG make recoil learnable like in games like CS?
[2023-01-05 11:12:10] <+Zuper_R> without binaural audio, I can't hear when they come from above or below :/

[2023-01-05 11:13:27] <+wowaudeh> @klean just got back to tarkov after some time, any advice for climbing to 15?
[2023-01-05 11:13:29] <SkySt0n3> pistol recoil should be alot more controllable
[2023-01-05 11:13:31] <+DonutConspiracy> MP5 is bad with recoil
[2023-01-05 11:13:34] <TekarukiteCZ> I hate that I can't rest my gun on stuff

[2023-01-05 11:13:39] <jkingx707> i run an gun that thing with the fov had a duo call me a cheater haha
[2023-01-05 11:13:48] <SkySt0n3> m4s should have low recoil
[2023-01-05 11:13:50] <%obedezuu> Make semi-auto more viable. TAP TAP NODERS
[2023-01-05 11:13:55] <jkingx707> ppsh slaps got mine lvl 2 last wipe
[2023-01-05 11:13:57] <ziltoid_69> @bobthemutant Oh goodie. Thank you
[2023-01-05 11:13:58] <ItzSweatttt> I feel like the mp9 would be a fun to use but the recoil is insane
[2023-01-05 11:14:07] <%+Zoixy> @Klean You still roll pistol and rifle? What cheap pistol do you recommend?
[2023-01-05 11:14:12] <TekarukiteCZ> @Klean the MCX recoil is funny AF
[2023-01-05 11:14:14] <PREDATORnotPREY> Should I use binaural audio now?
[2023-01-05 11:14:14] <+TiredBoiTV> why run 9mm if you can never get decent ammo
[2023-01-05 11:14:16] <Djpjmana1> some of the ak's jump to crazy compared to real life
[2023-01-05 11:14:27] <%bobthemutant> Good to use if you need to do Tremor Headshots, easy arm break.
[2023-01-05 11:14:29] <+TheLoneSurvivorr> @Klean is big sale bugged, i just went to all stores and it reset
[2023-01-05 11:14:30] <+serial_bus> when the game only applies realism when it makes the game harder LULW

[2023-01-05 11:14:47] <+wowaudeh> Do people still run kedder at low levels?
[2023-01-05 11:15:04] <PimpMyWiki> @TiredBoiTV yeah, I'm with you, but it depends.. if I'm only going to run a few raids, I can easily harvest 9mm, similarly to 7.62 PS rounds
[2023-01-05 11:15:04] <%obedezuu> Man MCX is such a nice looming rifle but recoil makes it horrendous.. FeelsBadMan

[2023-01-05 11:18:00] <+BOTD3r3k> as a player whos had the game since it came out and has shot rifles in real life i can say the FOV bug should be put in the game

[2023-01-05 11:18:08] <ziltoid_69> @obedezuu Helps that .300BLK AP is better stats wise than 55A1, 10 more damage, better pen... MCX was my main AR for cqb

[2023-01-05 11:19:15] <%bobthemutant> @1killersquirrel they added it as a compromise because people were using 3rd party shaders that gave them a significant vision advantage.

[2023-01-05 11:32:55] <CerealKillerDude> god, the sound of that door opening NotLikeThis
[2023-01-05 11:32:58] <HormeQ> How do you zoom in more? @Klean
[2023-01-05 11:33:04] <CerealKillerDude> sounded like it was opened 2 floors up
[2023-01-05 11:33:11] <%obedezuu> Man, keys this wipe is SO rare. FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-05 11:33:13] <%Swako21> @1timthetoolman1 the opposite, with kind of a glitch you can remove the zoom

[2023-01-05 11:33:41] <+TiredBoiTV> @DeathDeclined then we could spawn right beside somebody?? that would suck
[2023-01-05 11:33:57] <%+Wolvf_TV> what is this gun
[2023-01-05 11:34:15] <%Swako21> does that sight have different reticles like the ekp?

[2023-01-05 11:34:43] <silentspook> is this scope just a cobra or new as well
[2023-01-05 11:34:47] <thirtydarkzero> @Swako21 seems like
[2023-01-05 11:34:49] <Lefty831> How you doin Klean? @klean
[2023-01-05 11:34:59] <%+WolfChicken36> @silentspook new
[2023-01-05 11:34:59] <syrros> Klean u still using the dts or no ?
[2023-01-05 11:35:18] <%Swako21> @Swako21 monkaHmm
[2023-01-05 11:35:33] <silentspook> This gun seems cool
[2023-01-05 11:35:41] <PimpMyWiki> I think I totally agree though, the Zooming should not be a thing except if you hold breath.. I hope BSG makes the Klean-Aim-Edit
[2023-01-05 11:36:04] <DeathDeclined> @TiredBoiTV what do you mean you already do that now lol
[2023-01-05 11:36:20] <%Swako21> when I solo I almost dont sprint because of how easy I become hearable
[2023-01-05 11:36:22] <GradeEhCanadian> thanks been using the glitch alot today @Klean
[2023-01-05 11:36:34] <holeshredd3r> I walk as much as possible. No use getting in a hurry lol I also like a bird watch while I’m in raid

[2023-01-05 11:36:53] <gregoryiscute> bsg will not add zooming in when holding breath that seems arcadey I know some agree and disagree but yeah
[2023-01-05 11:37:04] <+herr_dietrick> New optic?
[2023-01-05 11:37:16] <ItzSweatttt> What are the spawn chances of bosses right now
[2023-01-05 11:37:20] <%23rubel> @holeshredd3r dont forget the landscape. those 2004 treemodels need some love too
[2023-01-05 11:37:20] <nyaqua_gg> @gregoryiscute and zooming in whole fov while ADSing isnt arcadey?
[2023-01-05 11:37:21] <+braaguey> thats how insurgency works and its great imo
[2023-01-05 11:37:23] <%Swako21> @gregoryiscute I mean it already does just by aiming so idk
[2023-01-05 11:37:34] <Chiurly> monkaW
[2023-01-05 11:37:34] <PimpMyWiki> @gregoryiscute well, now you zoom in just by hitting right mouse button, that's more arcadey
[2023-01-05 11:37:36] <someanybody> can you remove your cam for a rides, and on it on menu and stash?
[2023-01-05 11:37:40] <+TiredBoiTV> @DeathDeclined i understand what you mean but if it was completely random somebody could spawn a cars width behind you then just press m1 no?
[2023-01-05 11:37:50] <+FexGl> @ItzSweatttt i think 5 -10 %
[2023-01-05 11:37:53] <nyaqua_gg> @someanybody he does it sometimes for night raids
[2023-01-05 11:38:04] <+SummitVotedTrump> prefer cam

[2023-01-05 11:40:10] <DeathDeclined> @TiredBoiTV i mean obviously I am talking about implementing  it so that the  spawns would not be on top of each other... that's the whole point of my comment

[2023-01-05 11:46:40] <PimpMyWiki> @rRellik you can dump your shit in a bush and take someone elses stuff, or maybe you get clapped by a scav, but in a spot where you won't get easily found by players...

[2023-01-05 11:47:53] <BenEllis1989> yo, @Klean when you tap fire are you pulling down on the mouse too?
[2023-01-05 11:47:59] <dmitrybeard> id pay to see someone run through a bush in full gear and gun LUL
[2023-01-05 11:48:00] <ru99_> yo chat does anyone know what to do when the mouse cursor gets stuck in the middle of the screen? i restarted the game and got it again the next raid
[2023-01-05 11:48:02] <+Mulesy95> looks fun
[2023-01-05 11:48:03] <%+Buudum> I have died to that wire too many times
[2023-01-05 11:48:03] <+rRellik> using BT in it or PS ?
[2023-01-05 11:48:05] <starnectar> what ammo he using in it?
[2023-01-05 11:48:12] <%ForsaikenRedskye> master it?
[2023-01-05 11:48:13] <PimpMyWiki> @rRellik also you can run subpar stuff you're almost guaranteed to get returned, so you can keep running stuff that's basically free that no one wants.. like a super big and long shotgun for instance
[2023-01-05 11:48:14] <MadxGrimm> PS
[2023-01-05 11:48:14] <jewbronlames> Aug is fun

[2023-01-05 11:48:34] <%Swako21> @ru99_ usually restarting does it for me, playing borderless prevents it too for what I've seen
[2023-01-05 11:48:38] <+BrNlicious> is it a 9mm gun?
[2023-01-05 11:48:39] <zimokaya_> Is it expensive?

[2023-01-05 12:01:54] <weebwack3r> I don't think there's even a difference between slow walk and crouch
[2023-01-05 12:01:57] <cham_fam> @jkingx707 man I wish they'd just get rid of perception altogether, such a lame ass skill
[2023-01-05 12:01:57] <weebwack3r> sounds the same on this patch
[2023-01-05 12:02:05] <twonickels> love the drip
[2023-01-05 12:02:05] <NetizenMusic> @jbreezy_97 thankyou, so all are busted and just have a slightly different EQ

[2023-01-05 12:02:12] <james_76235> what is the point of max level skill bonuses. 1% of the game gets to use them. wasted effort on the dev's part
[2023-01-05 12:02:18] <TrusT_Reks> seems like audio has gotten progressively worse with every iteration or engine change BSG did.. its crazy
[2023-01-05 12:02:20] <jesusdr1nk> They should just scrap perception as a skill tbh
[2023-01-05 12:02:25] <jkingx707> @cham_fam yea i never get it that high but i hear its super op
[2023-01-05 12:02:25] <meg_man> the drip is giving fallout vibes
[2023-01-05 12:02:30] <%PutinIsSmallAndBald> You cant sneak up so ur left with . 1. Stand afk and wait or 2. Play it like CoD and rush
[2023-01-05 12:02:32] <+totushek> knights armor is sick
[2023-01-05 12:02:36] <+Sycuown> is audio the biggest issue with the game right now

[2023-01-05 12:03:21] <%+Wolvf_TV> they should hire crytek for audio
[2023-01-05 12:03:29] <TrusT_Reks> i think its time BSG needs a real competitor on the market that knows audio & performance is important in this genre
[2023-01-05 12:03:33] <hacme> Audio is like the most important thing in tactical shooter and it's so sad that it is that broken
[2023-01-05 12:03:45] <ThatHomieNano> huh lol m39 are op too
[2023-01-05 12:03:48] <NetizenMusic> did they move to unity 19 this patch?

[2023-01-05 12:03:56] <+WheresTheRest> theyre really gonna add a cat instead of better audio wheres88LOL
[2023-01-05 12:03:57] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> BSG do need a competitor the game is significantly less fun than it used to be, its just a pain to play now.
[2023-01-05 12:04:03] <%bourbon_l> new BEAR drip is actually dope
[2023-01-05 12:04:03] <PREDATORnotPREY> I concur
[2023-01-05 12:04:03] <%+Wolvf_TV> @hacme thats why you play hunt showdown cause its the best audio so far
[2023-01-05 12:04:06] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> its lost its magic for me and most toehrs
[2023-01-05 12:04:06] <+ruiskatv> It was always like that

[2023-01-05 12:04:08] <+Leprechaun003> love how they keep increasing the price on them too
[2023-01-05 12:04:11] <maxxrageous> i think BSG should postpone work on new content stuff and work on the basic function of the game
[2023-01-05 12:04:12] <%+ace_poontang> @klean take it easy broskiff. off to the fire station. as always, thanks for bein you. enjoy the rest of your day!
[2023-01-05 12:04:17] <+Stetzer> Personally, I'd like to see a wipe where all comtacs are just disabled
[2023-01-05 12:04:17] <wiffcraft> are those glasses good? I've got them on a scav but dropped for other loot
[2023-01-05 12:04:20] <acekanzy7> NODDERS
[2023-01-05 12:04:20] <TrusT_Reks> but hunt showdown is like 0% a military sim / survival like tarkov :S not digging ist sadly
[2023-01-05 12:04:22] <%ForsaikenRedskye> i did an offline raid with and without a headset and i enjoyed without. i knew where things were even better

[2023-01-05 12:04:46] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> Audiop is just a vital part of games like this and somwhow BSG actually made it a lot worse like just leave it how it was ffs
[2023-01-05 12:04:50] <Plissken099> when i was in the army and our hearing Pro was pelators, they didnt give me superhuman hearing its a weird game design

[2023-01-05 12:05:24] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> I dont think BSG should just be able to change the game, it be worse and keep it like that, its rude asf
[2023-01-05 12:05:28] <hatedslick> just crafted my last ice cream cone
[2023-01-05 12:05:29] <mtvmata> for me that you can't sneak anymore, change drastically a gameplay
[2023-01-05 12:05:29] <jesusdr1nk> The reality is that a triple A studio won’t put the effort to make a competitor, it’s too much dev time and they know it, there is a reason tarkov is the only one this in depth
[2023-01-05 12:05:34] <saffer001> @steve_v5ttel bro its just another 5.56 gun, what do you think? they are all the same

[2023-01-05 12:06:30] <silentspook> audio has been an issue with tarkov for a while however just not so much in the last wipe or two
[2023-01-05 12:06:32] <%+Hint0fLemon> maybe once you get to like 10 am you might feel a bit more awake?
[2023-01-05 12:06:33] <TrusT_Reks> my take is: BSG was to incompetent to get steam aduio to work correctly so they hoped an engine change would help. But now they have even less clue on how to use the new engine

[2023-01-05 12:06:55] <+iambuffan> Escape from loadingscreen, damn so fun to wait 10 min for a game
[2023-01-05 12:06:59] <fixyee> @NorGlace agreed
[2023-01-05 12:07:00] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> @TrusT_Reks that what happened 100%
[2023-01-05 12:07:00] <PREDATORnotPREY> I don't understand why the audio took such a turn. When I first started playing this game in 2018 it was sooooo much better. Don't get it LUL
[2023-01-05 12:07:06] <Thorst4n> steam audio was way better than what the hell we have now, even with the bugs
[2023-01-05 12:07:07] <silentspook> same thing goes for the scavs. Every couple years, they become OP
[2023-01-05 12:07:12] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @Scweets doesn't mean i'll not wear a headset. i'm used to both since my scavs usually don't have any. preference i guess.
[2023-01-05 12:07:13] <steve_v5ttel> @saffer001 just asking what he thinks about it. Good job on being a dick and not true.
[2023-01-05 12:07:13] <Rise_14> why do scavs kill scavs when looting a airdrop. like wtf are they that horny for loot
[2023-01-05 12:07:17] <%+redvced> @jesusdr1nk also not casual enough
[2023-01-05 12:07:30] <+PlagueRX> @iambuffan invite someone and then ready up. tricks the game into thinking your in a group
[2023-01-05 12:07:31] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> BSG made a better audio system than this occulous why dont they bring that back around .11 audio #
[2023-01-05 12:07:34] <+stocksjock> how did he just zoom in while ads?
[2023-01-05 12:07:39] <NorGlace> @NorGlace  Ijust dont play when it rains but ive been having super fun i night raids it super chill :d my heartrats has dropped my 200 XD
[2023-01-05 12:07:41] <Surako> @Rise_14 yes
[2023-01-05 12:07:49] <+Scweets> @ForsaikenRedskye oh you meant in game lmao my bad. yeah without seems better ingame
[2023-01-05 12:07:49] <BadeTM> does anyone knows if the bush sound issues are fixed and when so for binoral and normal sound?
[2023-01-05 12:07:50] <jesusdr1nk> @cheeseandbunionthe4th Ur completely right, Im not defending that tarkov isn’t a mess, I’m just saying, with all the maps, loot, guns, attachments that is so over the top, a triple A studio hasn’t touched

[2023-01-05 12:08:19] <+franz_444> anybody know which level that new kobra reflex is?
[2023-01-05 12:08:23] <+gityousucka> this gear is heavyyyy
[2023-01-05 12:08:27] <dmitrybeard> @cheeseandbunionthe4th yeah. like COD did with dmz. cant fix shit, don't want to fix it. mode full of bugs, became boring after 2 weeks. any triple A studio will need to invest tens or hundreds of millions to even come close to tarkov at this point. not to say tarkov is close to being good
[2023-01-05 12:08:29] <StayOzone> oh sh#$ new this wipe? looks cool how you like it?
[2023-01-05 12:08:34] <+Stevemartv> is offline and setting AI to horde a good way to learn chat ?

[2023-01-05 12:08:39] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> @jesusdr1nk all this stuff is useless tho we only use 5% of the stuff in tarkovc, its a very shallow game when you actually look at what you use, compared to what you could use, we have maybe 4 guns and ammo types out of 100's
[2023-01-05 12:08:40] <ThatOneFriendlyDude> @samthebravefps SR-2M submachine gun, Prapor 3
[2023-01-05 12:08:46] <+iambuffan> @PlagueRX yes, but it's not something that would be needed LuL
[2023-01-05 12:08:48] <NetizenMusic> what's worse the audio or the scavs on crack. imo scavs been fkn me harder than the audio
[2023-01-05 12:08:53] VIEWERS: 10 982
[2023-01-05 12:09:06] <Pil_R> those scavs on customs are sick, gonna kill u for a backpack pieces of shit
[2023-01-05 12:09:10] <NorGlace> SCAVs are the real bosses now lol :d
[2023-01-05 12:09:18] <+PlagueRX> @iambuffan I know thsy should just fix it but it makes the queue faster at least for now
[2023-01-05 12:09:21] <Sabotacer> anyone know how to avoid the stream freezing while watching for drops?
[2023-01-05 12:09:23] <+iamsnaps> @cheeseandbunionthe4th Spot on
[2023-01-05 12:09:29] <%+g4rlaa> @Klean are u using bineral audio?
[2023-01-05 12:09:29] <CerealKillerDude> @Klean i just found a dead cultist on night factory scaving. Did they spawn there before?
[2023-01-05 12:09:31] <DocReverb> little dicey
[2023-01-05 12:09:33] <+gityousucka> scavs going harrrrrd rn
[2023-01-05 12:09:33] <jesusdr1nk> @cheeseandbunionthe4th And so far, all the ‘tarkov-like’ attempts by cod or bf have been shallow in that regard, so idk, so far no one has caught the essence cas it’s a lot of work that they probably consider a risk
[2023-01-05 12:09:45] <+iambuffan> @PlagueRX yeah but thx, gonna try it for now.
[2023-01-05 12:09:46] <Z00Therapy> how is ur gun switching speed so fast???

[2023-01-05 12:10:00] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @Scweets ye, it seems a little better audio wise when i do since i don't use the "audio fix". i just use stereo and don't use oculus at all. i still hear things where they are.
[2023-01-05 12:10:11] <silentspook> its 9x21
[2023-01-05 12:10:16] <laskySZN> i havent played the game in years before this wipe i feel like scavs are on roids
[2023-01-05 12:10:19] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> @jesusdr1nk the devs of cod said they arent making anything to do with tarkov so that was just the community thinking that
[2023-01-05 12:10:19] <Sabotacer> @Thorst4n was 360p all the time, still
[2023-01-05 12:10:23] <%Swako21> @CrowGB 5

[2023-01-05 12:27:16] <Keulenkonrad___> @mc_st0nerr It is generally a good idea to remove batteries from electronic devices when they are not in use for an extended period of time. This can help to prevent battery leakage, which can damage the device. In the case of a tactical flashlight, it is especially important to remove the batteries if the flashlight will not be used for an extended period of time, as the high power output of these flashlights can put a strain on the batteries and potentially cause them to leak.

[2023-01-05 13:06:50] <Doyle8809> @SlanAbhaile that was what it was like ages and ages ago, you hit the key and a bar would appear at the bottom of the screen showing how far along the heal you were, and you could move at full pace
[2023-01-05 13:07:01] <theactualaltair> Bussi is a Finnish and means a "bus" xd

[2023-01-05 13:08:03] <bigploop> at least player scavs cant lock on through bushes

[2023-01-05 13:09:05] <RochaCarioca> It's too early in the wipe for the average player to handle too many scavs.

[2023-01-05 13:11:37] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> shoreline especially is just ancient compared to the other maps
[2023-01-05 13:11:37] <+Chrischros1> @taggrt wich epopel still udnerestimate imo
[2023-01-05 13:11:38] <bigploop> agreed D2 sucks
[2023-01-05 13:11:42] <akaBlackbeard> Streets is exactly the type of map I like, just cant play it right now LUL
[2023-01-05 13:11:42] <+Im_Liimits> @joshgav thats not a bizon bizon has a top loaded rounded mag
[2023-01-05 13:11:42] <jnBuzzn> you look very tired my man
[2023-01-05 13:11:42] <Clapp1ty> ngl the underground area kinda ruined pace of that map
[2023-01-05 13:11:46] <+justlnquisitive> I hate Shoreline so much
[2023-01-05 13:11:49] <DreamUnluckyy> AGREEEE
[2023-01-05 13:11:50] <+The_PEPINO999> When Shoreline expansion first came, was WAY worse than Streets (Optimization)
[2023-01-05 13:11:55] <+5m4q> Hi Klean! It's good to see you streaming Tarkov, love your gameplay!

[2023-01-05 13:12:03] <exedas> but i wonder what could you do for interchange ? @Klean

[2023-01-05 13:12:07] <taggrt> @Chrischros1 when you can hear the tiniest details, like a player ADSing, i dont know if there is covert movement
[2023-01-05 13:12:07] <+gbval> woods expansiopn was nice
[2023-01-05 13:12:08] <+Keth_tv> I like it being there, I just wish it had to be opened either by a timer or action done on the map
[2023-01-05 13:12:12] <NetizenMusic> anyone tried labs with these sound bugs? unplayable?
[2023-01-05 13:12:13] <drugcoins> the underground on reserve is too intimadating
[2023-01-05 13:12:13] <+Chrischros1> @taggrt or stay under weight
[2023-01-05 13:12:15] <%Saro4president> yeah interchange and shoreline have to be reworked, from lighting to new location on shoreline, shoreline is big but have only few parts of interest
[2023-01-05 13:12:17] <voxorgroso> Any woods enjoyers? PogChamp
[2023-01-05 13:12:19] <%+MTReese_> Underground should it’s own map, kinda like how they do it stalker
[2023-01-05 13:12:29] <+Keth_tv> I love woods post expansion
[2023-01-05 13:12:32] <+HiDark> delete the map and start over xD
[2023-01-05 13:12:34] <MadxGrimm> and get rid of the fog
[2023-01-05 13:12:34] <Clapp1ty> or rework
[2023-01-05 13:12:35] <+Chrischros1> @taggrt covert mo0vement skill lowers all your sounds your pmc makes so ?!
[2023-01-05 13:12:37] <b0iiink> How did it ruin reserve? I dont understand
[2023-01-05 13:12:37] <Doyle8809> It'd be fun if they added a rooftop area of Interchagne too
[2023-01-05 13:12:46] <RapidlyAgingOldFart> A FOB outside could be nice
[2023-01-05 13:12:46] <grumpygawwd> Thanks for putting me on to Dwarf Fortress, its sooo incredibly good. Unreal.

[2023-01-05 13:12:51] <Chthonian> More extracs would be so poggers
[2023-01-05 13:12:53] <%Saro4president> underground of reserve is great, just the D2 extraction doesnt need to be here
[2023-01-05 13:12:54] <taggrt> @Chrischros1 didnt know much about that
[2023-01-05 13:12:55] <MartxelTejedor> More points of interes on interchange and shoreline
[2023-01-05 13:13:04] <+alch3mist7> I would also move some of the loot to the top floor
[2023-01-05 13:13:09] <%+ryrythefancyguy> is Interchange at night w/NVG's a better experience?
[2023-01-05 13:13:12] <+HiDark> Why more extracts dont u love getting extract camped xD

[2023-01-05 23:11:16] <+F1toaster> you get anywhere with audio @klean ? Been messing around with my Steelseries Nova headset and still can't get the sound I'd like. Tried that DTS headphone X with and without binaural and although binaural seems moderately better then frame tank sucks.
[2023-01-05 23:11:16] <%+countryttv> my scav raids have been cracked today. i feel like they upped the loot or something
