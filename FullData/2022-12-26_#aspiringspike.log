[2022-12-26 16:18:02] <dexagos> Modern just has better interaction. That’s it’s “legacy-ification”

[2022-12-26 16:20:30] <dexagos> I think I’m being confusing in what I’m saying. I mean what most people constitute as the legacy-ification is the addition of the evoke elementals when having pitch cards does not equal legacy
[2022-12-26 16:20:44] <%+Avinan> Just because the incarnations see legacy play does NOT mean their meta is comparable to ours

[2022-12-26 16:21:47] <BlatzCubed> would you still play shadow of doubt in UW shells? I saw that video and it looked very fun but didn't know if the format shifted to where it's not as good @aspiringspike
[2022-12-26 16:21:51] <+shoboy321> i think spike has the best chat commands of any magic streamer, the counters that increment every time someone brings them up is so good

[2022-12-26 16:22:54] <%+kentuckyfri3d> initiative is best mechanic LUL
[2022-12-26 16:22:56] <cruicked> I think modern is getting more powerful so ppl just associate it with legacy.
[2022-12-26 16:22:59] <+WildNerdAppears> Modern has almost no efficient fast mana, and nowhere near the amount of free interaction.
[2022-12-26 16:23:07] <cruicked> not even close to the same tho.
[2022-12-26 16:23:24] <AtomykSound> I hope we'll never see Initiative in Modern :)

[2022-12-26 16:23:49] <%ValeckSeimu> legacy cant even afford a monke in the format... worst then standard tho
[2022-12-26 16:23:50] <Nikolas_CMX> upvote
[2022-12-26 16:23:51] <@%Marvoleath> I think the point was that with more cards in pool, you get the most efficient decks which leads to lower mana requirements/faster play

[2022-12-26 17:44:47] <@%^MTGBot> The League Match has started! aspiringspike (4-0) is currently playing Predicted (3-0). Last seen deck 6 days ago: Yawgmoth (http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5304276) (Predicted is also currently double queuing in a Modern Super Qualifier.)
[2022-12-26 17:45:15] <@%phuckingmagikal> Breach feels better than kroxa as you just get raw cards back. I found that I was missing more card advantage, and breach is it. It can also give reach. breach gives reach

[2022-12-26 19:44:15] <+sixfootsev3n> “Eldrazi creatures just suck” man what a difference a few years makes
[2022-12-26 19:44:19] <wavelink17> Eye of Ugin died for matter reshapers sins
[2022-12-26 19:44:31] <+Optimus_Tom> @sixfootsev3n Still Winter but no Eldrazi to be found
[2022-12-26 19:44:47] <+sixfootsev3n> Unban eye of ugin, make them remember
[2022-12-26 19:44:49] <%+mifuneenthusiast> I mean, part of the reason Eldrazi were good was because of Eye of Ugin.
[2022-12-26 19:44:54] <%JanvierCF> how well is chalice positioned in general nowadays?
[2022-12-26 19:44:58] <%octo_zed> eldrazi creatures were standard power level without ugin
[2022-12-26 19:44:59] <%+mifuneenthusiast> A big part actually
[2022-12-26 19:45:03] <smolfifi> 2016
[2022-12-26 19:45:07] <+Optimus_Tom> no wayyyy
[2022-12-26 19:45:07] <+wilnet2> Eldrazi creatures were never the reason to play eldrazi... it was the mana cheating lands lol
[2022-12-26 19:45:21] <%delabj> was it 2014?
[2022-12-26 19:45:21] <+Optimus_Tom> Eye of Ugin was 2016
[2022-12-26 19:45:27] <WarKr0> the eldrazi weren't the problem, the problem was casting a million on turn 2
[2022-12-26 19:45:27] <wavelink17> Chalice is well positioned but without mana monkey is so much less scary
[2022-12-26 19:45:28] <%delabj> I think it was 2016
[2022-12-26 19:45:28] <+Martyrlz> Turn 2 TKS was infuriating
[2022-12-26 19:45:35] <+Martyrlz> And with like 2 mimics on turn 1

[2022-12-26 19:45:50] <tappingitout> Stompy
[2022-12-26 19:45:54] <$mrorangecats> Would eldrazi even be good if they unbanned eye of ugin?
[2022-12-26 19:45:59] <+toginablender711> Eldrazi Tron was doing well in 2018-19 for a bit. Yamakiller was doign well with it in challenges for awhile
[2022-12-26 19:46:05] <Roberto_mtg> Yes, they would im

[2022-12-26 19:46:45] <+sixfootsev3n> 4/13/16 was the eye ban
