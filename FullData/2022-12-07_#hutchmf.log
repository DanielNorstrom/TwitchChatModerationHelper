[2022-12-07 17:32:47] ~Reddit hates me and summit... Mainly summit Hutch/Peak NoPixel (Grand Theft Auto V)~
[2022-12-07 17:32:47] Joining #hutchmf..

[2022-12-07 17:32:47] You have joined #hutchmf
[2022-12-07 17:32:48] <chalie2152151> Do you think shotz should have joined the chase honestly?? Your opinion
[2022-12-07 17:32:51] <%Mr_Graybush> So have you and the GF had a chance to do any baby shopping yet Hutch? Time flies brother
[2022-12-07 17:32:53] <%+PastTheSingle> so they are mad cause shotz was a cop going after cg?
[2022-12-07 17:32:53] <%Carvine> you the man hutch
[2022-12-07 17:32:54] <%CuzinJames> have the boys found out how much time they are getting?
[2022-12-07 17:32:59] <energyskill2> cg is on top because they put out great rp unlike reddit where everyone is a cry baby
[2022-12-07 17:33:01] <+warm_pancakes_> Ramee isn’t opening it until after he’s out from jail I think
[2022-12-07 17:33:09] <+ewan_grid_racing> @BIG_RIFF lol
[2022-12-07 17:33:12] <Tzuyu4K> @tej007123 the cause might be good but its aimed at the wrong people and countries plus her parents are using her

[2022-12-07 17:34:15] <%average_savagery> CG honestly should be on top.... Look at how much RP they bring with their businesses and how much exposure they bring to the city and EVERYONE in the city
[2022-12-07 17:34:22] <Houghtonn> does spaceboy still stream no pixel?
[2022-12-07 17:34:36] <EvoCyberNation> Why does that necklace catch on fire every once in a blue moon?

[2022-12-07 17:48:06] <%MrJohnnyBarton> @BigSosa_91 Need content. If the chase is over right away. No content

[2022-12-07 17:48:53] <%+ItsNovaSam> @cozzie_1 they haven’t done anything worth escalating yet
[2022-12-07 17:48:57] <+CorJam_> Why chat acting like all chases IRL instantly pit? Lol

[2022-12-07 17:49:02] <Kctokool03> WICKED
[2022-12-07 17:49:03] <k_dot7997> So the cops just want to stay on the criminal until they’re out of gas? Is that what they’re trying to do?
[2022-12-07 17:49:08] <%Dirty_Beggar> @ItsNovaSam no idea bro, i don't go to that cesspool. I was referring to the stream title
[2022-12-07 17:49:33] <%+ItsNovaSam> @dirty_beggar rog, all good bro
[2022-12-07 17:49:34] <DeadeyeJF> @cozzie_1 yes there is a timer before pits or spikes. Nothing wrong with carrying out a chase
[2022-12-07 17:49:36] <%d3ltaf0x> i suppose you know by the title 🤣
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%d3ltaf0x> Heyas Hutch , Hi Chat
[2022-12-07 17:49:50] <%Carvine> yeah basically
[2022-12-07 17:49:55] <+acterious> @k_dot7997 they authorise pit if the chase goes on too long or the crims get reckless driving that threatens locals and other peoples lives e.g riding on sidewalks and opposite lanes
[2022-12-07 17:50:11] <%baseballtigar> how dare you give them an inch, that's against SOP
[2022-12-07 17:50:14] <%Carvine> yea
