[2022-12-17 20:18:53] <BluebellKittenz> Sumeru is fun, one of the commissions you literally bounce on mushrooms
[2022-12-17 20:19:02] <knightworld16> Inazuma is easiest tho most of em just fight or complete an obstacle course

[2022-12-17 20:23:44] <hyrum_alger> aether has drip
[2022-12-17 20:23:45] <escall> lumine have a better dps than aether
[2022-12-17 20:23:47] <knightworld16> lumine does more damage any ways
[2022-12-17 20:23:50] <moonluneay> Lumine is the best option
[2022-12-17 20:23:51] <problemonade> poor aether üòÇ
[2022-12-17 20:23:52] <eiweslley> what Aether >>>>>
[2022-12-17 20:23:52] <%ESHDhanaura> lumine is so derpy
[2022-12-17 20:23:54] <kuijiiii> i don't think drowning counts, you just lose a bit of HP and your bursts, you respawn after drowning, so it doesn't count
[2022-12-17 20:23:54] <tochiro11> nah u just chose the waifu
[2022-12-17 20:23:54] <%jocularlace1221> @m4ydayy it‚Äôs worked pretty well ever since I did it I have lost the 50/50 once
[2022-12-17 20:23:56] <M4ydayy> I prefer Aether because he can run faster (bunny hopping)
[2022-12-17 20:24:00] <VinnieLeon> AETHER HAS DRIP YOU HATER

[2022-12-17 20:24:05] <hyrum_alger> @knightworld16 but aether is faster
[2022-12-17 20:24:05] <exoticbutter9924> I could say the same for you
[2022-12-17 20:24:13] <AnasAhmed21> Lumine is the better antagonist imo
[2022-12-17 20:24:15] <urfavhuta0> I'm not a hater I just prefer lumine wdym?

[2022-12-17 20:24:23] <paimelon_nom> anemo lumine is best
[2022-12-17 20:24:31] <potdweller> lumine supremacy
[2022-12-17 20:24:34] <VinnieLeon> Lumine is better abyss twin
[2022-12-17 20:24:37] <jennywennylennypenny> drawing while watching java >
[2022-12-17 20:24:40] <shafinedgar> Genshin hates lumine guys sometimes in the story it says he
[2022-12-17 20:24:42] <%ESHDhanaura> lumine plays both sides better, aether only works for traveller imo for eng
[2022-12-17 20:24:44] VIEWERS: 626
[2022-12-17 20:24:48] <quitereddish> I like lumine but idk her outfit is a bit boring compared to aether
[2022-12-17 20:24:49] <eiweslley> the way Aethers clothes are so stylish
[2022-12-17 20:24:49] <eheheheheheheheheheheeeh> If HoYo Doesn‚Äôt gimme raiden im gonna booooopppp myself

[2022-12-17 20:24:53] <ranpossnaks> do plan on doing a face reveal anytime soon or do have like a goal for it?
[2022-12-17 20:24:53] <Tomato6739> Lumine is better she is so discriminated against
[2022-12-17 20:24:56] <malia_rosa> have you lost anyone yet?
[2022-12-17 20:24:56] <tochiro11> did u know that there is a difference between Aether and lumine??
[2022-12-17 20:24:59] <Dragonic_Tonic> I used Noelle as soon as I got her... and that was my "Genshin Starter" after that lol
[2022-12-17 20:25:00] <moonluneay> It doesn‚Äôt count
[2022-12-17 20:25:00] <d0kidoku> Aether has WAY more drip and swag than Lumine.
[2022-12-17 20:25:02] <boxheadal> @shafinedgar sometimes it also says she lmao /lh /nm
[2022-12-17 20:25:03] <labaguetteelol> Java if u use dendro u can do more damage
[2022-12-17 20:25:09] <LoveAjaxx_> @quitereddish agreed
[2022-12-17 20:25:12] <kuijiiii> Lumine's charged attack actually does more dmg, and Aether runs and climbs faster, so it'll depend wether you pefer exploration or dmg
[2022-12-17 20:25:12] <eheheheheheheheheheheeeh> Gimmeeeeee raiden hoyo
[2022-12-17 20:25:18] <benjerlikesgames> Aether is really just the poster boy
[2022-12-17 20:25:21] <justa_ghost_> I love both ü§∑
[2022-12-17 20:25:21] <wyren_peak> Its not that lumine is a bad protagonist, it‚Äôs just that Aether is a bad antagonist.
[2022-12-17 20:25:24] <hyrum_alger> i think lumine is a better antagonist
[2022-12-17 20:25:24] <talon_flame> technical when a character drowns all the members in the party lose there burst which only happens when character dies
[2022-12-17 20:25:32] <M4ydayy> Genshin players love that what the game developers hate
[2022-12-17 20:25:33] <problemonade> @shafinedgar üòÇüòÇno, aether is the original canon mc and that's why they make those mistakes
[2022-12-17 20:25:34] <lizzdark> and because Aether is more popular, i lile lumine more
[2022-12-17 20:25:34] <botheatlantean> the one you pick is canon. thay use aether to avoid confusion
[2022-12-17 20:25:36] <v3v3_gaming> @javathecuptv
[2022-12-17 20:25:41] <tochiro11> Lumine is stronger and Aether is faster
[2022-12-17 20:25:43] <v3v3_gaming> Your amazing
[2022-12-17 20:25:45] <aelcil> Lumine looks better as an antagonist
[2022-12-17 20:25:45] <%super_zzo> Hu tao too lol
[2022-12-17 20:25:49] <potdweller> lumine is the better antagonist but i still prefer her as the protagonist
[2022-12-17 20:25:53] <Tronop04> Barbara has like.. 3 scenes

[2022-12-17 20:25:57] <VinnieLeon> I don't dislike lumine, I just think she makes a better abyss twin, and Aether gives more protagonist vibes
[2022-12-17 20:25:58] <hyrum_alger> java what's your favorite voiceline that is not from raiden shogun

[2022-12-17 20:26:08] <LittleCrimsonFox> aether doesn't look as threatening as lumine, so she looks like a better villain

[2022-12-17 20:31:06] <alihur20> Few days ago I was pulling for faruzan and got Jean. I was happy that I could get raiden without having to win the 50/50 until a ten pull later I get scaramouche

[2022-12-17 20:35:57] <ravensfury2> im basically cata;yst only, i use keqing mona yae miko and nahida only
[2022-12-17 20:35:58] <1Rheviun1> I just got a faruzan, fav warbow and another faruzan BACK TO BACK SINGLE PULLS, i think its a sign
[2022-12-17 20:35:59] <jellyevo> when you do the flower planting thing I'm pretty sure you can melt the things and make the daily shorter
[2022-12-17 20:36:02] <problemonade> @pokemon_ad heyy! welcome and congrats!!!
[2022-12-17 20:36:05] <kazuha_is_perfect> Sooo likkke did you forget that dendro traveler is a sword character?
[2022-12-17 20:36:05] <knightworld16> what sword is that?
[2022-12-17 20:36:06] <hyrum_alger> guys whats your status on ducks?

[2022-12-17 20:36:18] <problemonade> @knightworld16 blackcliff
[2022-12-17 20:36:19] <quitereddish> imo it's bc she's doing raw DMG and like that she doesn't perform the best. In a dendro aggravate comp maybe she will perform better
[2022-12-17 20:36:25] <raythechair> @hyrum_alger quack
[2022-12-17 20:36:32] <snowsprin> Java my DPS Keqing has 25% crit rate and 90% dmg whereas my Layla has 45& crit and 100+% dmg, I think you're good
[2022-12-17 20:36:35] <darkmoon_c> i think She would be nice with dendro but there arent any swords yet if you dont count traveller

[2022-12-17 20:49:45] <ravensfury2> i havent done weeklies in about 3 months

[2022-12-17 20:52:51] <lolitsmal> hyper bloom is better
[2022-12-17 20:52:51] <DJF20202> aggro is much stronger electro damage
[2022-12-17 20:52:51] <dis_ez_rose> I wanna know how java is gonna react to Al Haithem
[2022-12-17 20:52:53] <xxtinct25x> I feel that most people either choose hyperbloom or burgeon

[2022-12-17 20:52:57] <darkmoon_c> aggravate kequing it's acutally good i use her only with that
[2022-12-17 20:52:58] <wolfh09> both is good
[2022-12-17 20:52:58] <DJF20202> hyperbloom dendro not electro
[2022-12-17 20:53:00] <%ESHDhanaura> i personally like aggravate
[2022-12-17 20:53:00] <%+winte0r_> IT LOOK SO FUNNY xd
[2022-12-17 20:53:00] <%Zyletta> what  no, aggro is the best reaction
[2022-12-17 20:53:00] <boxheadal> event is out
[2022-12-17 20:53:01] <lolitsmal> also burgeon is really good
[2022-12-17 20:53:02] <sayu__main> Imo aggravate is the best reaction
[2022-12-17 20:53:09] <RazBerryTFB> same, i need the raiden shogun and then zhongli so that i can get an archon team
[2022-12-17 20:53:10] <%Sm3ttle> will you do any other game series? for example The Devil in Me and so on
[2022-12-17 20:53:11] <%tea7ay> I use keqing for aggro
[2022-12-17 20:53:13] <blu1sh69420> how are you today ?
[2022-12-17 20:53:16] <ravensfury2> U get a new sword doing the event
[2022-12-17 20:53:22] <lolitsmal> ayato in the next phase
[2022-12-17 20:53:25] <prtypoisxn> aggravate is good it increases your electro damage
[2022-12-17 20:53:25] <xxtinct25x> Ayato is next banner
[2022-12-17 20:53:25] <catpotato27> Ayato is next
[2022-12-17 20:53:25] <khandja1314> aggro cracked
[2022-12-17 20:53:27] <shadowlord9679> Ayato and Alhatiam is the next sword characters i think
[2022-12-17 20:53:29] <jellyevo> thoughts on the genshin TCG?
[2022-12-17 20:53:30] <kuijiiii> i already r5 it, but ti's still lvl 40, the passive is pretty good tho
[2022-12-17 20:53:33] <jaegerbombtennis> the current event has dialogue and is time gated for a bit
[2022-12-17 20:53:39] <vikiiiiiiiiii> aggrovate is really good for nahida or raiden or keqing or yae mains bc it's more dmg
[2022-12-17 20:53:48] <genshin_geek> oh man, that moving eye on that sword creeps me out sometimes...
[2022-12-17 20:53:52] <darkmoon_c> you should try kequing with a dendro traveller if you can
[2022-12-17 20:53:52] <lolitsmal> 800 dmg-
[2022-12-17 20:53:57] <%+winte0r_> the sword literally lokoks like an umbrella
[2022-12-17 20:54:01] <catpotato27> Imagine if Keqing doesn‚Äôt crit
[2022-12-17 20:54:08] <sansous_she_her_elle> But is Ayato and Raiden, so we must all pull for Raiden. No character better than her Kappa
[2022-12-17 20:54:09] <rainy_yumii> evil umbrella sword
[2022-12-17 20:54:09] <RazBerryTFB> 5 digits? you dont have the luck for that
[2022-12-17 20:54:11] <+ben_dukey07> Hi, love your YouTube :D :D
[2022-12-17 20:54:12] <wyren_peak> What about the talents tho?
[2022-12-17 20:54:12] <LoveAjaxx_> help why is that better then every of my characters but does less damage then them
[2022-12-17 20:54:12] <alihur20> When I blow out my candles on my birthday cake I will pray that you get scaramouche on your spells only account and pray you didn‚Äôt have dog artifacts.

[2022-12-17 20:54:18] <DJF20202> aggro could make your keqing hit 32k ultimate with your stats and EM sands

[2022-12-17 21:56:01] <WandererReine> New one is for Bloom
[2022-12-17 21:56:03] <+glowlngx> i think gilded is better bc yae does her own dmg too
[2022-12-17 21:56:07] <yoyo_shiei> don't ask me I don't have miko I'm not helpful : D
[2022-12-17 21:56:13] <+glowlngx> and not just hyperbloom dmg
[2022-12-17 21:56:20] <+Migud24> guilded dreams is more universal
[2022-12-17 21:56:21] <Perky_Crits> curse you java, now i badly want a pudding.
[2022-12-17 21:56:22] <+sneyss> you can't really use the scara set for anyone but can use dendro for nahida
[2022-12-17 21:56:24] <boxheadal> wait does it not work for hyperbloom?
[2022-12-17 21:56:28] <MazeMeme> oof
[2022-12-17 21:56:46] <yoyo_shiei> I would have miko if it wasn't for STUPID KACKOW
[2022-12-17 21:56:46] <blackcat_3> for agravate and hyperbloom the old one is just more versatile
[2022-12-17 21:57:07] <xhaileyzz> what time is it for you now java
[2022-12-17 21:57:17] <notolykyuhere> hey what's up, it's the first live i see of you

[2022-12-17 21:58:42] <M4ydayy> If Kokomi gets another re-run before Shenhe gets her first re-run I will be so angry

[2022-12-17 22:08:46] <notolykyuhere> @t_1kun if you have 2 mains it's good to go for raiden, if not maybe ayato is considerable
[2022-12-17 22:08:49] <daroach> Righttt. A cryo catalyst would be so much better
[2022-12-17 22:08:55] <LegendCasque> @JavaTheCupTV If you want some a quick couple Primos, you could go here on the Level 1 domain with Nahida and Yanfei/Klee on max EM and do the Burgeon achievement.
[2022-12-17 22:08:55] <pastelle_gachaa> which domain are you doing rn?

[2022-12-17 22:09:31] <M4ydayy> Why would Hoyoverse ever make a CRYO catalyst? That is simply prepostorous
[2022-12-17 22:09:32] <purplekrypton> @purplekrypton Haha maybe targetting the wrong enemy.

[2022-12-17 22:10:06] <benjerlikesgames> which is better than em as swirl takes longer to hit 5k and not crit
[2022-12-17 22:10:12] <malia_rosa> the mini games of the new event are amazing but theres a loooooooooooot of dialoge
[2022-12-17 22:10:16] <LegendCasque> @JavaTheCupTV The Catalysts that use Chains are Lost Prayer, Frostbearer, Sacrificial Fragments, and Magic Guide.
[2022-12-17 22:10:18] <oiiya> Have you reached friendship 10 with any of your characters yet?
[2022-12-17 22:10:18] <littleangelrose> i remember you making a hrdyo claymore so i dare you to make a cryo  catylst

[2022-12-17 22:11:04] <@^StreamElements> Do not tell the A.I. to "Pull on X banner". The A.I. will pull if he wants to. You will be muted / banned if you repeatedly do this.
[2022-12-17 22:11:06] <purplekrypton> Scaramouche joined the emo cult

[2022-12-17 22:11:35] <LegendCasque> If you go into Cecilia Garden with Nahida and Yanfei or Klee with max EleM minimum ATK you could probably crack off that Burgeon achievement real quick.
[2022-12-17 22:11:37] <prtypoisxn> @aqua_lol_ free c1
[2022-12-17 22:11:38] <paimelon_nom> you accidentally names your scaramouche "keqing"
[2022-12-17 22:11:39] <benjerlikesgames> but you dont get the pyro dmg bonus

[2022-12-17 22:18:27] <soofok> i was gonna say if ur going healer u would pic 2pc maiden and 2pc ocean hued clam
[2022-12-17 22:18:30] <xhaileyzz> name wanderer ''cryo catalyst''
[2022-12-17 22:18:34] <M4ydayy> That is a lot of numbers

[2022-12-17 22:18:40] <famoustears> its only a breif like 6 hour quest...
[2022-12-17 22:18:50] <aqua_lol_> So what did y'all named scara? (I named him Mommy issues)
[2022-12-17 22:18:50] <cellistiacat> Crit works well for Favonious procs at least
[2022-12-17 22:18:51] <nsnsjxjn> Give barbara the rainslasher
[2022-12-17 22:19:01] <purplekrypton> Java, what is Yae's weapon?
[2022-12-17 22:19:02] <pyrorekka> why do I have a feeling the only cryo catalyst we get is the tsaritsa
[2022-12-17 22:19:05] <soofok> not THE BELL i mean the bell
[2022-12-17 22:19:09] <xhaileyzz> painslasher*
[2022-12-17 22:19:14] <knightworld16> well I guess since he has Heizhou to build. he would also farm maiden set
[2022-12-17 22:19:21] <famoustears> give barbara the debate club
[2022-12-17 22:19:23] <daroach> Put widsith on Barbara cult assemble
[2022-12-17 22:19:24] <littleangelrose> java we all will make a vote for names of scacamouche then see the surpise of death
[2022-12-17 22:19:34] <prtypoisxn> give barbara wolfs gravestone
[2022-12-17 22:19:34] <LegendCasque> Java can you try giving Barbara a Clam set with just, whatever you have laying around?
[2022-12-17 22:19:35] <paimelon_nom> give your scaramouche your painslasher
[2022-12-17 22:19:39] VIEWERS: 682
[2022-12-17 22:19:41] <benjerlikesgames> cant you do 2pc anemo 2pc new anemo set
[2022-12-17 22:19:42] <M4ydayy> Give barbara the key of khaj-nisut
[2022-12-17 22:19:50] <Archidec> I like how no one attempts to say Tulaytullah when they talk about the weapon
[2022-12-17 22:19:51] <1azury> You know I think that cryo catalyst u have would work really well in this domain!
[2022-12-17 22:19:53] <elouan_bmt> drop!
[2022-12-17 22:19:54] <benjerlikesgames> for 30 anemo bonus
[2022-12-17 22:20:05] <xhaileyzz> i use 2pc tenacity and 2pc clam on kokomi
[2022-12-17 22:20:07] <benjerlikesgames> plus the goblet wouldbe anemo
[2022-12-17 22:20:20] <xhaileyzz> why would you need the foams if you have other dps
[2022-12-17 22:20:23] <elouan_bmt> drop!
[2022-12-17 22:20:32] <hahyourmom> god artifacts lets go
[2022-12-17 22:20:33] <knightworld16> Kokomi heals Soo much that ocean hued make the shearling into damage. barbruh doesn't heal as much as Kokomi so 2pf maiden and 2 PC ocean is better
[2022-12-17 22:20:37] <sprit_bit> btw why do you use japanese Voice overs instead of English? just curious
[2022-12-17 22:20:38] <littleangelrose> my pov: JAVA WAKE UP FROM YOUR SHELL AND LOAD! java pov: right
[2022-12-17 22:20:48] <famoustears> physical catalyst when?
[2022-12-17 22:20:51] <prtypoisxn> put that on your physical catalysts
[2022-12-17 22:20:55] <M4ydayy> You could do for healer barbs 2pc clam/maidens and 2pc tenacity
[2022-12-17 22:21:00] <scaramouchefan101> physical damage is the best for catalyst users!!
[2022-12-17 22:21:02] <pyrorekka> which set are you strongboxing?
[2022-12-17 22:21:04] <@^StreamElements> Please do not pester the A.I with questions of "Will you pull for X character?" He hardly even knows who he'll pull for himself.
[2022-12-17 22:21:06] <nsnsjxjn> Imagine we get a physical catalyst before a cryo catalyst
[2022-12-17 22:21:13] <xhaileyzz> yeah i alsor ecommend 2pc tenacity
[2022-12-17 22:21:39] VIEWERS: 682
[2022-12-17 22:21:42] <soofok> if you use barbara for hyperbloom shouldnt you get EM
[2022-12-17 22:21:43] <+HectorMirelez> Everytime I see Yae's outfit i just think KFC
[2022-12-17 22:21:54] <M4ydayy> Better hope it doesn‚Äôt start spinning
[2022-12-17 22:22:05] <wolf_potato0765> hello this is my first time seeing one of your streams
[2022-12-17 22:22:06] <knightworld16> read that sentence slowly. Physical Catalyst. yes the sith Lord descends and fights with the force in his hand
[2022-12-17 22:22:07] <xhaileyzz> i mained kokomi but i still prefer tenacity instead of 4pc clam because she has more hp now and heals better since she's the support after all..
[2022-12-17 22:22:09] <sunchi__> i kinda see it
[2022-12-17 22:22:17] <nice991> i think of BK
[2022-12-17 22:22:26] <1azury> Storytime?
[2022-12-17 22:22:28] <soofok> would yae with the kfc glider match?
[2022-12-17 22:22:34] <nice991> yes its delicos

[2022-12-17 22:22:36] <szonyibence> Hello
[2022-12-17 22:22:38] <prtypoisxn> why not 4pc tenacity on kokomi instead of 2pc 2pc?
[2022-12-17 22:22:41] <wolf_potato0765> ooooo is this catalysts only?

[2022-12-17 22:31:09] <Mc_Ts> I feel like you should skip ayato in favor of al haitham on swords only

[2022-12-17 22:45:34] <notolykyuhere> a fun team to try is machine gun yoimiya, you use xingqiu, yelan(or zhongli maybe) and raiden as supports and she destroys eveything
[2022-12-17 22:45:41] <captainet_> If u don‚Äôt have gilded it‚Äôs better but gilded is more universal
