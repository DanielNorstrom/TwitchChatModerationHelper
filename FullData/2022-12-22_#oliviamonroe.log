[2022-12-22 16:35:14] <Komfigaming> I've seen children on a leash
[2022-12-22 16:35:14] <%AllHailKingJulian> multi-cat has the skills to go indoors and outdoors
[2022-12-22 16:35:17] <%+Rocrhulan> When do you think Christmas went from being about Jesus to being about the fat guy the reverse robs you?
[2022-12-22 16:35:17] <ShoMibu> I seen a pigon on a leesh.
[2022-12-22 16:35:18] <%+shibiririreruwa> No call cats can be either indoor/outdoor cats. But if your cat has lived all its live indoors it's not safe to let it out
[2022-12-22 16:35:20] <+Baal90567> u mean children? on a leash to keep them from running away yes?... not adults yes....
[2022-12-22 16:35:22] <%+PedroYuuhi> Pigs are good pets
[2022-12-22 16:35:23] <%$KiraNoOkami> piggies can be cute

[2022-12-22 16:35:41] <Womperschnitzel> my former roommate was apparently a leash kid
[2022-12-22 16:35:42] <!%AirahsELL> not that. its the fact that cats are an invasive species with explosive breeding seasons so they can actually wipe out the local bird population. cats, for all intents and purposes, are still wild animals that happen to like staying inside.
[2022-12-22 16:35:42] <+TsarBomba9271> and not as smelly as movies make out
[2022-12-22 16:35:43] <%+PedroYuuhi> I've seen people with racoons on Canada

[2022-12-22 16:36:45] <%+PedroYuuhi> And have a dedicated vet
[2022-12-22 16:36:53] <ShoMibu> I'm sure theres videos to help raise. but most are wrong.

[2022-12-22 16:40:26] <%$ipponsky> my family had an animal shop when I was a kid. We had a python snake that a kid would come visit every day. One day, some chinese guys came in and said the ways they would cook the snake. the kid ran home and got money to buy the snake. then he put it down on the public garden, and it ran away instantly KEKW

[2022-12-22 16:42:52] <%+shibiririreruwa> Capybaras are all cute until they become invasive species. Then they become tag free hunting animals
[2022-12-22 16:42:59] <Tylphen> not even a hot take, really. the process of getting an exotic pet also usually feeds and encourages terrible poaching practices
[2022-12-22 16:42:59] <+Baal90567> yep, hate it as everybody should
[2022-12-22 16:43:04] <%+PedroYuuhi> I live in the natural habitat of Capybaras, people have them as pets like 500 years ago
[2022-12-22 16:43:12] <!%AirahsELL> so you watched that weird documentary where people own tigers
[2022-12-22 16:43:13] <ShoMibu> There was one in Texas I heard got out an ran amonk. Arrested the guy because its illegal to own a animal like that.

[2022-12-22 16:48:40] <Venatorino> monkaS Never expose it to sunlight. Never get it wet. Never, ever feed it after midnight.

[2022-12-22 16:48:48] <!HardcorexHunter> Olivia wants you to gather all the german shepards and release them where they belong....Germany. Thousands of German Shepard's just released into Germany the German people hide in fear.
[2022-12-22 16:48:49] <!%AirahsELL> @zibookishgamer they roll around in dust and shake around
[2022-12-22 16:48:50] <+Gothdaimremix> wait, they can’t get wet? how do they live in nature?
[2022-12-22 16:48:51] <michaeljande> @ZiBookishGamer They give themselves dust baths, yes.

[2022-12-22 16:50:08] <$DrSocrate5> @AirahsELL usually the gland is removed. i met someone who has a pet skunk as well
[2022-12-22 16:50:10] <Womperschnitzel> I dated a girl who had a cat with an actual name (that I can't remember) but it was mainly called by a local curse word and that's what it reacted to
[2022-12-22 16:50:12] <HeXhax> I studied as a vet and i am conflicted on CHUNKY pets bc its both cute and unhealthy
[2022-12-22 16:50:21] <%Sotetsu> Ferrets are cute but smell so bad.

[2022-12-22 16:52:56] <!HardcorexHunter> I gave my great grandma a snake I caught in the yard and she dispatched it and cooked it for us to eat...Great grandma was hardcore like that; I don't think I'd trust handing her a bunny.

[2022-12-22 16:53:13] <!%ZiBookishGamer> They can die of fear, I think

[2022-12-22 18:55:00] <%merchantilist> U-u-u-m no. Don't go down there.
[2022-12-22 18:55:02] <Issenthevampire> Would you sleep on a Japanese futon Oli?
[2022-12-22 18:55:06] <%+InaneDugong> Sure, but first a magic trick *sends her home*
[2022-12-22 18:55:06] <blamo_excalibur99> Keanu Reeves is under my bed
[2022-12-22 18:55:08] <%Edibleghost> I moved the jars before she came over, no worries

[2022-12-22 18:55:28] <%Sotetsu> I had to double check, Kamehameha was the FIRST king of all of Hawaii, not the last. My bad.
[2022-12-22 18:55:29] <+machacha_fulgrim> only the druids of my sick dresser may judge whether you can find your phone now
[2022-12-22 18:55:30] <%AllHailKingJulian> she thinks I'm joking :(

[2022-12-22 18:55:47] <marklarphd> Futons sound nice because you can move them out of the way. I need a huge bed and it takes up most of my room
[2022-12-22 18:55:52] <%TalkingObject> Make a hammock
[2022-12-22 18:55:57] <+TsarBomba9271> bed frames over rated
[2022-12-22 18:56:03] <%+PedroYuuhi> One day Oli might affords pallets for a bed

[2022-12-22 18:56:36] VIEWERS: 422
[2022-12-22 18:56:37] <@%arcanumghost> bedframes really are just for storage, being 1-2ft higher doesn't do anything for sleep
[2022-12-22 18:56:39] <%+PedroYuuhi> Do you put stickers on your phones case?
[2022-12-22 18:56:53] <Mantorok888> Imagine not just falling asleep on pile of your own dirty laundry couldn't be me
[2022-12-22 18:56:56] <blamo_excalibur99> You got a Motorola razor flip phone

[2022-12-22 18:57:15] <%merchantilist> Bedframes are CRITICALLY important for making earthquakes while you're sleeping infinitely more terrifying.
[2022-12-22 18:57:16] <noremann> "military grade" means it's the cheapest-made that meets standard LUL
[2022-12-22 18:57:24] <%AllHailKingJulian> granny's movin' up, I'm so proud
[2022-12-22 18:57:24] <Womperschnitzel> I moved to my first apartment and I realized I had absolutely nothing. I tried making dinner and I realized that I had to cooking gear or a microwave. No sofa, no tv, just a bed
[2022-12-22 18:57:25] <%TalkingObject> Not enough spaced
[2022-12-22 18:57:26] <%spicyworm_> girl pockets are a crime
[2022-12-22 18:57:34] <%Sotetsu> I don't use a case. This phone is 3 years old and has been dropped many times. olivia50Oho
[2022-12-22 18:57:34] <blamo_excalibur99> You mean industrial strength case

[2022-12-22 18:58:04] <nyjoe41> I have a t moble cell phone that i owned
[2022-12-22 18:58:10] <%spicyworm_> you know you're rich when you can carry your phone around naked
[2022-12-22 18:58:12] <+heeropatv2> owning a case infuses you with delta operator stats
[2022-12-22 18:58:13] <%Sotetsu> @65613_jk_ I mean, it's not on purpose.
[2022-12-22 18:58:15] <@%BlackCharcz> No matter how good case and glass I get, I am somehow able to totally massacre my phone in a year.
[2022-12-22 18:58:16] <%merchantilist> I buy phones I can just toss on my end table. Thing is scuffed, but perfectly fine.

[2022-12-22 18:59:58] <+Gothdaimremix> yes definitely
[2022-12-22 18:59:58] <%merchantilist> Phone cases are for people afraid to lose a few thousand dollars. I'm not rich, just dumb.
[2022-12-22 18:59:59] <@%arcanumghost> ugh, my phone case is falling apart after only 3 months
[2022-12-22 19:00:00] <Issenthevampire> Before I leave the STORE
[2022-12-22 19:00:08] <violetfey> Always use protection
[2022-12-22 19:00:13] <%+PedroYuuhi> You gotta get stickers for your phone case
[2022-12-22 19:00:17] <%Sotetsu> I like my phone to take up as little space as possible, so no case for me.
[2022-12-22 19:00:18] <%bimten> I use a phone case when my phone is new.. and then when it starts dying I just stop using it. KEKW

[2022-12-22 19:02:49] <%+PedroYuuhi> I don't know where my cellphone is most of the time
[2022-12-22 19:02:50] <%Cronofuge> I pray every day that I don't mess up
[2022-12-22 19:02:51] <TheChewDawg> I use one of those neoprene sock dealies.

[2022-12-22 19:02:53] <@%BlackCharcz> The worst thing that happened to my phone was that I used it as a sled while falling down the subway stairs
[2022-12-22 19:02:54] <DM8917> gotta get the ones with the raised edges so it hits the case and not the phone screen
[2022-12-22 19:02:54] <+theonetruetodd> I have a pocket

[2022-12-22 19:02:56] <%ArcReaper_21> I get one even before I buy the phone so it is ready by the time I get it.

[2022-12-22 19:41:55] <JodanTheHero> Dinosaurs were avian, and they evolved into reptiles and birds.
[2022-12-22 19:42:00] <Womperschnitzel> some sharks lay eggs, some give birth to live young
[2022-12-22 19:42:02] <Xifani> to make it weirder, playtpus (which are mammals) lay eggs
[2022-12-22 19:42:02] <spookgerook> snakes were lizards
[2022-12-22 19:42:03] <%PigWithoutProtection> snakes are reptiles

[2022-12-22 19:42:15] <%+JayBusch> Some people do eat snake eggs
[2022-12-22 19:42:15] <thatoldfunnymilk_wolfy> they may be more cautious than chicken in hiding their eggs
[2022-12-22 19:42:16] <%merchantilist> They do in the South.

[2022-12-22 19:42:25] <%rempac15> because snake eggs are a pain to harvest vs chicken eggs
[2022-12-22 19:42:28] <marklarphd> Cladistically birds are still dinosaurs, but cladistically, humans are fish.
[2022-12-22 19:42:28] <%$sleepyxellos> dinosaurs also had feathers
[2022-12-22 19:42:28] <%Sotetsu> It's really important to me that Oli walk away from this knowing turkeys and ostriches are birds.
[2022-12-22 19:42:28] <%gambitmojo> snake eggs are proabbly too small
[2022-12-22 19:42:30] <DegreeScaffold> because chickens lay eggs once a day, but snakes not so frequently

[2022-12-22 19:50:29] <spookgerook> There are certain species insects and reprtiles in which the egg develops and hatches within the mother and is then born, I don't think any birds do that tho
