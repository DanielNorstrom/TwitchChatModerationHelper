[2022-12-10 00:14:49] <%+AntojoP> Greek myth was well documented, what we know of Norse myth comes from two books and they were a Christianized version of Norse Myths

[2022-12-10 00:28:44] <+HystematicDragon> Kratos during his younger years was mad at everything

[2022-12-10 00:31:31] <+doctorfroggy> @judgment37 dark souls would disagree with you lol
[2022-12-10 00:31:33] <+commanderpoes> Fun fact, there is actually a figure in Greek mythology named Kratos, he is indeed another son of Zeus, but instead of becoming the god of war or some such he is the personification of power in all of its aspects. Physical, mental, and spiritual. So while there aren't many stories involving him, he is theoretically the strongest being in the pantheon simply because of his  sphere of influence.
[2022-12-10 00:31:38] <%RealLifeFrogger> i mean, he is. but still.
[2022-12-10 00:31:51] <%RealLifeFrogger> yeah

[2022-12-10 00:31:58] <%+xehanort6416> The phrase "Too angry to die" definitely applies to Kratos
