[2022-12-28 19:43:51] <zoomerboomer124> @TommyKayLIVE Twitch chat can be a negative and toxic environment, and you don't want your child exposed to that kind of atmosphere. It's important for children to have positive and constructive online experiences, that's why I think you shouldn't let your kid into the Twitch chat.
