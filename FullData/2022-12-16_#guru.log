[2022-12-16 08:26:33] <%prettymuchtilted> @guru Do you think taking away oneshot from hog is a good idea? I definitely agree he needs a nerf but i think the oneshot is the only thing that makes him viable….

[2022-12-16 08:29:21] <%FehrTheTom> i feel like the battle pass is a good value it's teh shop thats crazy

[2022-12-16 08:29:23] <cIar1ty> YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO
[2022-12-16 08:29:24] <thaaad> JQ, Ram, Pharah
[2022-12-16 08:29:24] <dumbledoredrip> They need to innovate with the battlepass instead of doing the exact same thing as every game
[2022-12-16 08:29:25] <Twisted_Jones> if they take hogs 1 shot they need to take ahse and widows as well
[2022-12-16 08:29:25] <@%Haltedsun> It's $10... D:
[2022-12-16 08:29:27] <cIar1ty> GO ROADHOG

[2022-12-16 08:29:29] <dumbledoredrip> It’s so bland
[2022-12-16 08:29:30] <@%adorablemikey> guru has enough legacy coins where he won't have to pay money for the battle pass til 2031
[2022-12-16 08:29:31] <+StepBroDeej> the fact im forced to own that sym skin
[2022-12-16 08:29:34] <%+lDruid> I also don't paly tank so idc about Ramatra
[2022-12-16 08:29:37] <wreckitRobyn> Echo skin too
[2022-12-16 08:29:38] <%prettymuchtilted> Ram skin real nice
[2022-12-16 08:29:41] <c1v1l5ooo> I just started playing the game when they put battlepass and I dont have skins :((
[2022-12-16 08:29:42] <%+Step_Daddy_Dave> Battle passes are a good way to support a free game, but I also believe they have to make it worth to buy
[2022-12-16 08:29:48] <binobrando> blind hate smh the skins are good cmon
[2022-12-16 08:29:50] <invisiblegeese> Sym Cobra skin is fire

[2022-12-16 08:29:51] <okvzaki> I personally felt the last skins were better
[2022-12-16 08:29:52] VIEWERS: 945
[2022-12-16 08:29:53] <king_from_hell> The way OW2 does skins is so atrocious (monetization wise the skins are still cool asf)
[2022-12-16 08:29:55] <%spacecowboy6662> Give us a battle pass like fortnite to earn coins to get free passes even if its only ever other season
[2022-12-16 08:29:55] <+genocy> battlepass can have exclusives or smthn but the collectibles of every hero was BUILT around getting loot regularly
[2022-12-16 08:30:03] <%+lDruid> LUL
[2022-12-16 08:30:03] <@%^StreamElements> LUL
[2022-12-16 08:30:03] <dumbledoredrip> Like warzone did a really good job innovating the battlepass
[2022-12-16 08:30:07] <jujuondabeatyuh> How do you feel about the ramatra change?
[2022-12-16 08:30:10] <dumbledoredrip> Blizzard no good

[2022-12-16 08:30:15] <%FehrTheTom> @Step_Daddy_Dave this is true but a new hero + a mythic skin and a few really good skins mixed in there is enough for me
[2022-12-16 08:30:17] <%+p3dr0maz> fair enough KEKW
[2022-12-16 08:30:26] <capo1214> why does your zen sound like an AI?
[2022-12-16 08:30:26] <fisal9996> @GURU ya its cool but the jq skin is not my fav im still wondering if i buy it or not
[2022-12-16 08:30:32] <%+Step_Daddy_Dave> On the other hand 10 dollars can go towards something in real life that can be either a meal or something
[2022-12-16 08:30:44] <%ysabela_lala> hugee
[2022-12-16 08:30:46] <CrunchyDee> I would rather pay for OW $30 then join that marketing paywall with skins and heroes unlocks

[2022-12-16 08:31:20] <+genocy> @CrunchyDee same i'd rather it not be free and i can still earn shit
[2022-12-16 08:31:22] <pmarobot> @CrunchyDee the entire point of the model is for revenue though. otherwise it fizzles out on content just like ow 1 did
[2022-12-16 08:31:30] <dumbledoredrip> Overwatch was the only game with good lootboxes
[2022-12-16 08:31:35] <%+Step_Daddy_Dave> Were the loot boxes like apex packs?
[2022-12-16 08:31:45] <dumbledoredrip> Yes
[2022-12-16 08:31:48] <king_from_hell> @step_daddy_dave But better

[2022-12-16 08:32:52] <dumbledoredrip> I think blizzard could have lootboxes and a skin store… why not have both?
[2022-12-16 08:32:53] <Shaunstrocity> Also lootboxes are inherently predatory

Catch me tryharding every Overwatch comp game with a positive/optimistic-style of in game leading and target calling. I make the game easy for my teammates by taking over comms as much as I can. Whether that be player location, discord targets, or what ults the enemies have. This leaves my team to focus purely on listening and their own mechanics. I will do my best to win every single game. Minimum 50 bits for TTS

[2022-12-16 11:15:59] <!%$Wombat5Typhoon> like melee combat in chivalry for example is good because you can stack feints with different swings and there are counters/ripostes ... which is more technical than just melee mashing
