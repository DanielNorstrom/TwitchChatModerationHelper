[2023-01-11 01:57:14] <KingTootinCommon> loose powerup held up by a yellow block that you hit with the shell?  Avoids it dropping.  Or maybe a noteblock?

[2023-01-11 01:57:28] <timyungill> you coud use the throwblock to hit the first turnblock and have the shroom just be down there

[2023-01-11 03:37:09] <%TitoPronk> my wife asked what's that song for that tier 2 sub alert. anyone know?
[2023-01-11 03:37:11] <%thejumpingmouse> I watched that documentary "Running with Speed." GPW was name dropped. It was fun.
[2023-01-11 03:37:15] <+kbi_boxman> Geez how do you remember so much shit but forget everything at the same time lmao
[2023-01-11 03:37:17] <%joshuahatcher> it seems plausible that if the dev knew about the bug they could fix it. maybe it's something simple

[2023-01-11 03:37:37] <%Mynaras> If the lock is caused by dying before the pipe finishes moving, maybe the fix would be pausing the breath timer while using the pipe

[2023-01-11 03:54:20] <%zachhammer> There's nothing wrong.
[2023-01-11 03:54:20] <+Locustpointer> I think the problem is that it’s tied in with top green shadowing. I’m not sure it can be adjusted.
[2023-01-11 03:54:20] <%ribriba> the grass next to the tree is not the same color as the rest of the grass, but it's good enough
[2023-01-11 03:54:21] <%MalKayHe> feels like the wrong tile, like it has the top of neighboring trees
[2023-01-11 03:54:22] <%montibbalt> look at vanilla again, there's 2 different corner tiles
[2023-01-11 03:54:23] <%+sandstorm05> Bottom corner are having the top of another tree in it...

[2023-01-11 03:54:28] <%+SpecialK44> It’s the bottom exterior corners of the corner sprites not matching the grass
[2023-01-11 03:54:29] <%+jonnycarson1985> seems fine to me but what do i know

[2023-01-11 03:54:52] <%danoflondon> The grass that is under the tree has the same color of the green from the tree, not the color of the grass around it
[2023-01-11 03:54:54] <SuperYoshiNinjiTuesday> Is there a different tile in vanilla for a tree by itself?
[2023-01-11 03:54:55] <%montibbalt> nono one for when there's another tree and one when there isn't

[2023-01-11 03:55:05] <%zzayphod> Yes, it looks like the start of the top corner of other trees in the bottom corners.
[2023-01-11 03:55:05] <%TornadoPants> the one you used is next to another tree, not next to grass
[2023-01-11 03:55:05] <%$AmperSam> there is a tile for when trees overlap that you are using
[2023-01-11 03:55:13] <%Topgun486> the little hills on the bottom outside doesn't  match the grass

[2023-01-11 04:33:34] <$3volver> Maliketh seemed worse
[2023-01-11 04:33:35] <%PanteraHouse> Malenia probably hardest boss in gaming
[2023-01-11 04:33:35] <DariusLiadon> I hope one level ends up with the Hot Drinks port

[2023-01-11 04:33:54] <%MurderbyStorms> Malekith was the worst for ne

[2023-01-11 04:34:12] <%ShowtimeTylers> aside from that 7 hit flurry shes not bad
[2023-01-11 04:34:13] <%rabidwombat311> 1st phase melania is nothing
[2023-01-11 04:34:15] <%$yasarumit> I also really didn't like her life steal
[2023-01-11 04:34:15] <%$Kageyama86> any chance on getting a level with hot drinks music? barbSip
[2023-01-11 04:34:16] <%OneForTheMoney123> i saw a strimmer cry last night to her
[2023-01-11 04:34:18] <Spinjump19> sword saint is harder imo
[2023-01-11 04:34:20] <%$Undead_Berg> Nope, Sigrun GOW4
[2023-01-11 04:34:21] <%OneForTheMoney123> it was tough to watch
[2023-01-11 04:34:23] <%undietg> kaizo 3 bowser
[2023-01-11 04:34:23] <%$goodabouthood> orphan n gael were tougher imo..
[2023-01-11 04:34:24] <%+Corrugate> Yeah, the run where I beat her she just never used it. :-) The "heal even on blocked attack" is bullshit but managable on its own.
[2023-01-11 04:34:24] <$3volver> Manus
[2023-01-11 04:34:25] <%+panpsychotic> lady butterfly

[2023-01-11 04:34:28] <%eltzie> I had more trouble with sword saint 1st time than melania
[2023-01-11 04:34:29] <+simpletimms> I agree, Maliketh and Godfrey have more bullshit than Malenia.
[2023-01-11 04:34:33] <%+dethl0rd88> Melania is kinda easy imo
[2023-01-11 04:34:34] <%$33ryry33> kos yeah
[2023-01-11 04:34:35] <%$FairJeremy> barb fell
[2023-01-11 04:34:38] <%+Almemon> friede
[2023-01-11 04:34:38] <%eagleheardt> I think Jaquio from Ninja Gaiden 1 is the hardest boss ever
[2023-01-11 04:34:40] <%looteverybody> I remember when you were messing around with placing sprites with the bats, and being giddy over it LUL
[2023-01-11 04:34:41] <belariard> Gael took me forever
[2023-01-11 04:34:41] <%Faabricio> Placidusax made me really Madge
[2023-01-11 04:34:41] <Kaottiics> Orphan is easy as hell
[2023-01-11 04:34:44] <$FF3LockeZ> Kaizo 3 bowser is probably harder
[2023-01-11 04:34:44] <%PanteraHouse> Orphan is soo aggressive
[2023-01-11 04:34:45] <+chib0t> Demon of Hatred Sekiro
[2023-01-11 04:34:46] <%+Kymerah_> hits like a truck too
[2023-01-11 04:34:47] <%RedRustRiot> If we're counting multiplayer, there have been much harder MMO bosses
[2023-01-11 04:34:47] <%ImFatRollingIRL> malenia and sword saint are probably tied for me
[2023-01-11 04:34:50] <%$teddyb20> Cmon the water fowl has grown on you KEKW
[2023-01-11 04:34:55] <%ShowtimeTylers> orphan is extremely aggressive
[2023-01-11 04:34:55] <thumpywumpy> I feel like Laurence is harder than orphan
[2023-01-11 04:34:57] <%PanteraHouse> I just REALLY hate Waterfowl
[2023-01-11 04:34:58] <%$Coelacanth88> I think Isshin is harder than Melania
[2023-01-11 04:35:01] <HamsterBob> If your build is good for her, she's much easier than hard Sekiro bosses
[2023-01-11 04:35:04] <$CapnQuark> orphan will adjust which moves he uses more or less if you successfully dodge or not.
[2023-01-11 04:35:06] <%$Jakobi_17> I would say Gael 2nd phase is more aggressive than malenia
[2023-01-11 04:35:07] <%+CoMoVirinae> bean bat LUL
[2023-01-11 04:35:09] <Kaottiics> Bloodborne is such an easy game

[2023-01-11 04:35:10] <Fatmatt2000> I died on isshin about as much as melenia
[2023-01-11 04:35:11] <%+dethl0rd88> commander nails is harder for me personally
[2023-01-11 04:35:14] <%+dubiousdinobot> bean bat is cursed
[2023-01-11 04:35:15] <%+Zergoladin> You absolutely can, you never figured it out
[2023-01-11 04:35:19] <%3H_Hydracor> Rom is way harder than Orphan. Not even joking.
[2023-01-11 04:35:23] <+Bat_Boss> Isshin and Orphan are both pretty tough
[2023-01-11 04:35:26] <+chib0t> Demon of hatred made me rage
[2023-01-11 04:35:29] <%OneForTheMoney123> how the fuck did u beat her when u played with bow???
[2023-01-11 04:35:33] <%$33ryry33> first time I saw Gael second phase was about an hour ago

[2023-01-11 04:35:36] <%$teddyb20> I will NEVER forget just roll forward twice guy
[2023-01-11 04:35:40] <CorwinAmbrose> I thought that one dude said you could roll forward twice?
[2023-01-11 04:35:41] <$unknownohyeah> @Zergoladin you can, but what he's saying is if youre out of position you cant, which is true
[2023-01-11 04:35:46] <%+Fail_Snail> I saw that someone beat her twice simultaneously with a controller and a dance pad
[2023-01-11 04:35:47] <$Dracoraz> you shouldn't have to change your build to get around a bad design choice
[2023-01-11 04:35:50] <%+dethl0rd88> lol spring bat
[2023-01-11 04:35:56] <DracoDiabolus> any NES boss lol

[2023-01-11 04:35:59] <%+Dxpt1> ishin is the hardest
[2023-01-11 04:35:59] <%Nick_Whiskey> its really easy to get bodied by orphan and gael
[2023-01-11 04:36:00] <%IAmJester> i thought sephiroth in kingdom hearts was pretty tough.
[2023-01-11 04:36:01] <Kaottiics> Bloodborne is not a hard game
[2023-01-11 04:36:01] <%brohamulet> Bean bat is nightmarish
[2023-01-11 04:36:03] <%$udeechee_> I’m gonna nominate the final boss from ninja gaidan as harder
[2023-01-11 04:36:05] <%Faabricio> I think her lifesteal is terrible
[2023-01-11 04:36:06] <$unknownohyeah> @Zergoladin but yes, everyone knows, run away first 2 attacks, dodge in for 3rd, dodge out for 4
[2023-01-11 04:36:08] <$ghrymnyvek> I think it's diff for everyone. Double guardian ape was kinda BS the first time around.

[2023-01-11 04:36:18] <%looteverybody> It's funny, I've heard from people that the first game is harder than the second for God of War, but I beat the first game on the hardest, couldn't do it on the second
[2023-01-11 04:36:20] <%+mango77_> maybe im just bad, but the lich from gungeon kicked my ass
[2023-01-11 04:36:20] <%+blind_spotx> Virgil in DMC 2 i think it was was insane
[2023-01-11 04:36:22] <%ImFatRollingIRL> gael is fun, just not super hard
[2023-01-11 04:36:22] <%$Applin_L> Gale is FUN but not that hard
[2023-01-11 04:36:24] <%+GaimeGuy> Malenia's issue is more how long it takes to fight her
[2023-01-11 04:36:26] <%+Tredon> the fact that she can life steal through blocks is bullshit
[2023-01-11 04:36:26] <+chib0t> Ninja Gaiden bosses were OP
[2023-01-11 04:36:28] <%+deltahedge0> Gaels just a fun ass fight

[2023-01-11 05:12:38] <%+robbobert> are people really going to get in and out of the airship that often?
[2023-01-11 05:12:38] <alhoporo12> please no
[2023-01-11 05:12:39] <%$Xel562> put a slight delay on the music start?
[2023-01-11 05:12:43] <%$nondescriptivenickname> This has been a fun night! Loving the hack.
[2023-01-11 05:12:43] <%Solarfrost> Could you do the same song but it like changes insturments?
[2023-01-11 05:12:44] <%$The_Dog_Rules> @barbarousking could you make the song continue from where it left off?
[2023-01-11 05:12:45] <%+MrDrProfessorClay> rollingggg
[2023-01-11 05:12:47] <%jdero> Or like an additional beat. Like the yoshi drums
[2023-01-11 05:12:47] <%montibbalt> if it picked up where you left off it would be less annoying but i dunno how to make it do that

[2023-01-11 05:13:01] <%uttipaldonaldo> is adaptive music a thing in smw yet
[2023-01-11 05:13:04] <%flavortheghost> what about like a banjo-kazooie underwater thing -- same song but changes in tone/instrumentation?
[2023-01-11 05:13:06] <masheep_> Could it add to the regular overworld song? Like adding bongos when riding yoshi?
[2023-01-11 05:13:07] <%+Coreymill> vadalai barbGabnon
[2023-01-11 05:13:07] <%$bennismaximus> could be something like the yoshi song, a variant to the main world song

[2023-01-11 05:13:08] <%chef_bronson> the airship could have a radio
[2023-01-11 05:13:09] <alhoporo12> you could make it start and not stop
[2023-01-11 05:13:11] <%+dogfoodomelette> same song for overworld and a bass mix with airship
[2023-01-11 05:13:14] <%+Beefyfife> @barbarousking do you know the DDR song TwinBee? Has a “plane theme”
[2023-01-11 05:13:14] <%+KaladinCos> how about just when you're introducing the airship?
[2023-01-11 05:13:16] <%+dubiousdinobot> bloody tears front to back
[2023-01-11 05:13:17] <%+floppie7th> That's annoying but it's also entirely within the player's control - if they choose to get into and out of the airship repeatedly I feel like that's on them

[2023-01-11 05:13:19] <%DonkeyMintInc> It would be cool if the airship added instrumentation to the overworld music, like yoshi bongos
[2023-01-11 05:13:20] <%$wroday> just make a track that is the MM music starting over and over

[2023-01-11 14:58:39] <%wilky37> I prefer Doom on Sword Attack to Special, yeah
[2023-01-11 14:58:39] <%rgstupot> guan yu? barbToxic
[2023-01-11 14:58:40] <HaggisBodine> doom on spear is decent
[2023-01-11 14:58:43] <%dumpchest> why barb hate fisting?

[2023-01-11 14:59:14] <%+CJRyzer> what's the pb on spear?
[2023-01-11 14:59:21] <%sporkboots> always went for doom on attack w/ sword whenever i used it too, felt easier
[2023-01-11 14:59:23] <%rabidwombat311> i like dash nova with poseiden special tho, makes it more survivable
[2023-01-11 14:59:23] <%+penguinfarm> a little better when you're dashing into it but yeah
[2023-01-11 14:59:34] <$Tsuzuriko> if you're going slow might as well get the Excalibur
[2023-01-11 14:59:38] <%DickZippem> You can dash with sword special, that's the only way to make it viable from my experience.
[2023-01-11 14:59:38] <TheSabin> do it
[2023-01-11 14:59:38] <%+slairf> do it
