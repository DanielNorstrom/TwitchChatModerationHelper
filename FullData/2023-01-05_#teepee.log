[2023-01-05 15:17:23] <%youreexcused> Random question, I heard yesterday that if someone throws a smoke while they’re edge of zone or in gas, the other team can see them. Does that mean if you throw a gas grenade at another team while they smoke to run away, could you potentially see them through their smoke? Cheer100

[2023-01-05 15:25:42] <%+Misguided_Panda> He might mean he only has 2 more games to try the contract. Once you get the contract, you only have 3 games that it shows up I thought.

[2023-01-05 17:15:17] <%+OutlandishOW> You don’t have to update drivers for a little while if you find one that’s stable. Game updates or anything could change that
[2023-01-05 17:15:23] <%$Snapdaddy12> @stankdanklin because it's a buggy mess of a game that fixes and introduces new bugs with each patch and it's almost impossible for driver devs to keep up

[2023-01-05 17:36:05] <%$bowjackmann> Commercial iced tea = pretty much no caffeine. Homemade Alabama Sweet Tea = caffeine. Context matters.
[2023-01-05 17:36:05] <%thexrealness> herbal tea often has zero tea in it. green tea is the only tea without caffeine

[2023-01-05 19:05:31] <niloc17> @uNoDak how sad can a life be chilling all day in a twitch chat because you dont have any friends in reall life let's be host. You're as cringe as the ones who spam uwu and omegalul in the chat all day. Pls do soething productive and stop annoying everyone around you. You have the humor of a 7 year old while acting like a 6 year old so congrats. But youre in luck. With that humor not even cancer wants you. Probably the only good thing about you.
