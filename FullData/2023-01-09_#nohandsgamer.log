[2023-01-09 00:01:09] <%+helix_sky> sheesh! what a turn
[2023-01-09 00:01:10] <+The_monster_hunter> fair and balanced
[2023-01-09 00:01:25] <%+ericBG_> opponent is a pro gamer confirmed

[2023-01-09 00:01:48] <%Slider_HS> After Goku trains so hard he eats 2 tons of food and sleeps for days, maybe that's the key  Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:02:13] <%+helix_sky> i can do curls of potato chips
[2023-01-09 00:02:19] <orcchan> you're doing great man, keep it up

[2023-01-09 00:03:03] <%rexmkh> being lean is the meta
[2023-01-09 00:03:07] <orcchan> well bodybuilders use steroids
[2023-01-09 00:03:15] <%JonsyBones> I like it when turtles going oink oink. So cute
[2023-01-09 00:03:41] <%rexmkh> you also gotta buy new clothes if you get jacked
[2023-01-09 00:03:44] <%+orophen90> you put all that effort towards min/maxing things because eventually, thats the fun part anyways. not doing it for any reason other than your own satisfaction and progression

[2023-01-09 00:04:40] <Norwis_> you betrayed your priest soul nohands? thought it will take longer FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-09 00:04:50] <JulianMTL> noooooo Luke u cant join to the dark side!!!
[2023-01-09 00:04:59] <azreal3356> lean protein helps a lot to gain strength and not gain alot of weight
[2023-01-09 00:05:18] <orcchan> there's a rogue list against mirrors
[2023-01-09 00:05:18] <%+ericBG_> yes you lost the 1 in 3 in the early game Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:05:21] <%rexmkh> norwis questioning whether no hands' soul can be redeemed Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:05:30] <nachowelas> u need to pick draw cocs more often imo
[2023-01-09 00:05:45] <%Zuranthium> every streamer is just playing rogue pretty much
[2023-01-09 00:05:56] <Hyoob> +1 I was very surprised we passed on draw coc
[2023-01-09 00:05:56] <Norwis_> Rogue will be nerfed next week and then cool decks will be spowerful again
[2023-01-09 00:05:59] <%+ericBG_> for the record I really love watching naga priest and dislike rogue (esp theif) but I think I'm minority
[2023-01-09 00:06:12] <buj2456> when are they nerfing stuff?
[2023-01-09 00:06:22] VIEWERS: 404
[2023-01-09 00:06:26] <JulianMTL> @norwis_ u mean big spell of course? Kappa   greetings sir
[2023-01-09 00:06:34] <%+orophen90> if you're going for general physical health/attractiveness, you dont have to go super hard in the gym and you're correct. lean with some muscle tone and you're gold. and a lot of that is proper nutrition
[2023-01-09 00:06:35] <+craft_brew_matt> thia deck is so much more consistent than carrot ever was
[2023-01-09 00:06:36] <Norwis_> @JulianMTL hi champ
[2023-01-09 00:07:07] <Akaryn87> imagine the opponent see his name and he starts as priest, so the opponent mulligans for egg priest. And after 2 turns nhg changes to rogue and the opponent is like „VAIT VAT???? HOAW!?!?“
[2023-01-09 00:07:26] <Norwis_> I mean yeah if they dont nerf to ground next week I switch to rogur as well, hopefully they will kill it hard enough :D
[2023-01-09 00:07:32] <Norwis_> *rogue
[2023-01-09 00:07:39] <SethyGeez> Draw=Tempo because you get more efficient plays for the future
[2023-01-09 00:08:01] <%NathXVI> hola
[2023-01-09 00:08:17] <%matmarex> i have a question. it seems like rogue's play rate increased after the nerfs. has that happened before to another deck? thoughts?
[2023-01-09 00:08:22] VIEWERS: 404
[2023-01-09 00:08:24] <%rexmkh> wonder what they'll touch for dh. maybe raise the drawn card numbers for the quest and raise the cost of something like warband
[2023-01-09 00:08:25] <%+jerry_34_> deadge
[2023-01-09 00:08:55] <Norwis_> @rexmkh yes, prolly first part of quest to 5 instead of 4, they will nerf dh as well
[2023-01-09 00:08:58] <%Slider_HS> Hope nerfs are really coming next week. Last time Blizz hinted nerfs they said "later this month"
[2023-01-09 00:08:59] [Points] bankomat111 redeemed !getinmybelly (10 000)
[2023-01-09 00:09:02] <orcchan> they nerfed quest of dh before
[2023-01-09 00:09:12] <raphurpapa> shaman cant
[2023-01-09 00:09:45] <orcchan> maybe they will do something with 3 mana 2 spell damage
[2023-01-09 00:10:08] <+The_monster_hunter> Prep and Shadowstep will always keep Rogue ahead in some ways
[2023-01-09 00:10:08] <JulianMTL> frost dk have burst,  warrior have removal, priest have draw , but rogue have that all Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:10:20] <Norwis_> yeah imp warlock i rly bad vs rogue
[2023-01-09 00:10:21] <Norwis_> tried it
[2023-01-09 00:10:22] VIEWERS: 404
[2023-01-09 00:10:38] <%Zuranthium> it averages outt o 69, hmm
[2023-01-09 00:10:38] <%NathXVI> such a good guesser
[2023-01-09 00:10:41] <azreal3356> it gets to draw, cheat mana, and has great removal, then they made them benefit heavily for using their resources quicky how do you beat that without being heavy control
[2023-01-09 00:10:43] <%NathXVI> loterry numbers please luke
[2023-01-09 00:10:44] <unknown_visions> Is the egg priest list available anywhere?
[2023-01-09 00:10:45] <%NathXVI> Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:10:47] <Akaryn87> @Norwis_ they will add a healing coc to nerf rogue, +8 health so you can’t deal that much damage all the time if you roll bad Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:11:09] <AtLeastIGotTheCS> do you think that the problem was that those decks overperformed in lower ranks and got nerfed to the point that they couldnt compete in high legend?
[2023-01-09 00:11:20] <patrikk808> is it also a problem that you cant compete with druid in value?
[2023-01-09 00:11:25] <Sork_Phewe> belt to 3 mana, location to 4 mana. my nerf predictions
[2023-01-09 00:11:29] <%rexmkh> if dh quest gets nerfed again, i wonder if it'll still be better than nerfed dimensions
[2023-01-09 00:11:30] <orcchan> special treatment anasta87Nya
[2023-01-09 00:11:33] <Lmman44> Rogue and Druid just keeping getting cards that are just straight up better.
[2023-01-09 00:11:37] <Norwis_> @Akaryn87 agree, give them some useless cocs so its not always discover exactly coc you need FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-09 00:11:38] <Lmman44> than other classes

[2023-01-09 00:15:39] <Norwis_> mechanical complex much more complicated EZ
[2023-01-09 00:16:15] <+AshKenchum> thoughts on why overexplain overexplain game is so expensive?
[2023-01-09 00:16:19] <Zaxlor> Imagine playing HS KEKW
[2023-01-09 00:16:21] <dendaihs> A lot of aggro has low skill ceiling but has mechanical complexity.

[2023-01-09 00:16:29] <%NathXVI> I got to 97 as an all time best with naga priest last season and even posted to my twitter because I was so proud lame I know but... now I'm struggling at dumpster 1500 legend, I hate this meta
[2023-01-09 00:16:31] <%NathXVI> I must admit
[2023-01-09 00:16:43] <HenkerXR> me no understand. me just play greeny cards and pointy face. me win lot in legend.
[2023-01-09 00:16:47] <Norwis_> I mean boon priest is similar playstyle as d6warlock- 1 huge swing turn, need to do good order, enough apm-should win any game then
[2023-01-09 00:16:56] <YoungAficionado> best deck in the game that isn't rogue
[2023-01-09 00:17:00] <YoungAficionado> just straight up
[2023-01-09 00:17:11] <Norwis_> @YoungAficionado dh
[2023-01-09 00:17:26] <Hyoob> draw modCheck
[2023-01-09 00:17:34] <YoungAficionado> spell dh?
[2023-01-09 00:17:46] <dendaihs> I was thinking personally when playing aggro druid having to decide when is best to go wide vs trying to set up 2-3 turn lethals scaling 1/2 minions. I think an argument can be made with aggro pally
[2023-01-09 00:17:48] <YoungAficionado> or quest or is it both
[2023-01-09 00:17:57] <dendaihs> but now i switched to playing coc rouge mainly Sadge

[2023-01-09 00:18:45] <YoungAficionado> also kinda don't wanna play that 😕
[2023-01-09 00:19:00] <YoungAficionado> 1. rogue 2. dh 3.?
[2023-01-09 00:19:04] <MeBeeHappy> ty <3
[2023-01-09 00:19:14] <%rexmkh> i feel like patron warrior days when one of the high points of mechanical complexity
[2023-01-09 00:19:21] <%rexmkh> were one of the*
[2023-01-09 00:20:04] <%NathXVI> @MeBeeHappy 3-5 is more sticky I would imagine
[2023-01-09 00:20:20] <Norwis_> I mean I dont mind rogue/dh gameplay, but its stupid to face only 2 classes on ladder in high legend

[2023-01-09 00:20:37] <%+DraganDE> What is worse: Shark Rogue Tier S or Mech Mage Tier S?
[2023-01-09 00:20:38] <YoungAficionado> after rogue and dh
[2023-01-09 00:20:55] <+Dapperatchik> realistically it's not even rogue and dh
[2023-01-09 00:21:00] <+Dapperatchik> it's just rogue
[2023-01-09 00:21:02] <Akaryn87> @Norwis_ just think ahead and drop your rank
[2023-01-09 00:21:11] <%rexmkh> at least dh has limited resources. it sometimes feels like rogue has a bottomless pit of resources
[2023-01-09 00:21:19] <YoungAficionado> i'm playing big spell mage lmao

[2023-01-09 00:22:09] <YoungAficionado> is spitter hunter better than big spell mage?
[2023-01-09 00:22:25] <+Dapperatchik> norwis are you still playing only priest
[2023-01-09 00:22:27] VIEWERS: 432
[2023-01-09 00:22:40] <MeBeeHappy> the weapon if you dont have spell on hand reduce card on deck or not ?
[2023-01-09 00:22:42] <%rexmkh> vicious syndicate said hunter would be the big dog if it isn't hit in the next round of nerfs
[2023-01-09 00:22:50] <Norwis_> @YoungAficionado frost DK very solid prolly third, but more options
[2023-01-09 00:22:57] <Akaryn87> @Norwis_ i heard that there is no fun in hs anyway Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:23:00] <%matmarex> @MeBeeHappy it can reduce the spell you draw, but not a spell in deck
[2023-01-09 00:23:02] <+kritum_> what nerfs you think they will implement?
[2023-01-09 00:23:11] <YoungAficionado> fuxk i don't wanna play that either
[2023-01-09 00:23:27] <Norwis_> @Dapperatchik played DH and rogue on EU, but dont have collection on other servers-there I have to play priest
[2023-01-09 00:23:29] <YoungAficionado> i'm gonna stick to my decks ig
[2023-01-09 00:23:45] <HenkerXR> just give us 40hp renethal back
[2023-01-09 00:23:50] <YoungAficionado> playing big spell mage rn might switch around
[2023-01-09 00:24:04] <%+DraganDE> drawing location there would have been amazing
[2023-01-09 00:24:19] <MeBeeHappy> that was sick play if you hit loc
[2023-01-09 00:24:19] <+The_monster_hunter> That turn felt lackluster for a turn 4 Rogue, fucking crazy for a warrior though
[2023-01-09 00:24:22] <Akaryn87> @NoHandsGamer can you sent all this warriors to me please?

[2023-01-09 00:27:31] <VikingJackAU> Yes
[2023-01-09 00:27:31] <+Dtkaze> no, dh
[2023-01-09 00:27:32] <%NathXVI> Yeah
[2023-01-09 00:27:33] <+Dtkaze> you lose to rogue
[2023-01-09 00:27:35] <Norwis_> they play Warrior to counter dh
[2023-01-09 00:27:36] <+The_monster_hunter> Warrior is supposed to counter dh more
[2023-01-09 00:27:37] <%matmarex> "high skill cap" more like high skill Kappa
[2023-01-09 00:27:46] <+Dtkaze> you counter the dh and lose to the rogues
[2023-01-09 00:27:50] <%NathXVI> the reason people have been playing it is to counter rogue no?
[2023-01-09 00:27:58] <Akaryn87> i faced A LOT dh today
[2023-01-09 00:28:01] <%NathXVI> Thijs and reqvam called it TechW
[2023-01-09 00:28:04] <%NathXVI> I think
[2023-01-09 00:28:06] <dendaihs> There has been a decent amount of dh on NA today
[2023-01-09 00:28:10] <%NathXVI> But don't count me on that
[2023-01-09 00:28:11] <%rexmkh> as someone who mains dh at the moment, i've only played against like 2 dhs in the past 2 days in plat/diamond na

[2023-01-09 00:28:55] <%+BoltharHS> Realistically though, your analysis is spot on of both rogue as a class and J Alex as a personality when his class is doing bad vs. doing well

[2023-01-09 00:31:43] <%NathXVI> cant remember it
[2023-01-09 00:31:44] <%rexmkh> it is interesting to think that frostwyrm's fury was 7 dmg 7/7 7 mana initially. that would definitely raise frost dk's power level at the moment

[2023-01-09 01:29:47] <%+orophen90> i think biggest advantage of trainers is that once you've spent money on something, you feel committed/invested. and then that person helps with accountability. but most of what they'll help with exercise-wise can be found free all over the place
[2023-01-09 01:29:56] <%JonsyBones> you don't need them long term but they help with technique and developing regimens
