The 0 stands for the amount of girls Kurt has interaction with on a daily basis, the 4 for the amount of friends he has (123QQ, Poney, CFCalex and Senegal) and the 11 stands for the amount of years it will take to develop Poals 2033.

[2022-12-23 12:54:17] <+braveheartsaad> It’s the easiest mode for me
[2022-12-23 12:54:18] <%+waaweynka> champs is a game of mentality more than skill
[2022-12-23 12:54:18] <%+Enn_Dee> My friend is elite and he's never hit 16
[2022-12-23 12:54:19] <%+Harwoodinho> I just cant sweat for 20 on the bounce
[2022-12-23 12:54:19] <+mrwillis1707> div 3 and 11 - 14 normally stop at 11
[2022-12-23 12:54:22] <%+domyyb7> At the end of the day, you either get matched up against someone worse or better than you init
[2022-12-23 12:54:22] <+freestyle_iggs> @uwokes i'm in the same boat lol
[2022-12-23 12:54:22] <%+followthesponge> i find champs easier than rivals

[2022-12-23 12:54:46] <Cedsam_88> Div 3 to Div 1 is full of sweats missing out to complete their gameplay
[2022-12-23 12:54:49] <%bainer2788> The thing is with rivals anyone can eventually grind up the ranks as everyone good moved up eventually you will

[2022-12-23 15:02:45] <Ad_aamm> The reason most players perform worse at United is the pressure. They aren't used to it. Look at all the elite players that came to United, they still performed (Cr7, varane, casemiro) @hashtag_stokes

[2022-12-23 15:04:21] <chewablealarm> United have been making bad signings for 10 years. Schweinsteiger, Di Maria, Depay, Falcao, CR7, Sancho, Bailly, whoever is in charge needs sacking buying big players instead of creating a system first and then players that suit that system

[2022-12-23 15:04:55] <chewablealarm> De Beek aswell christ
[2022-12-23 15:05:01] <+marnzzz> @chewablealarm cr7 was a good signing for a season, sancho will be a good player, when he gets form back
[2022-12-23 15:05:23] <lfcnathann> nah all ur fans were screaming for him tho
[2022-12-23 15:05:25] <@%+JSharpp> 6-1? you finally doing the silver team challenge?

[2022-12-23 15:05:54] <teecbee_> its what arsenal needed for years too
[2022-12-23 15:05:54] <rjwolf82> Van de Beek was good at Ajax, but it’s another level, Eredvisie league is nothing compaired to Premier League
[2022-12-23 15:05:56] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> what is actually going on with sancho? mental problems right? or injury aswell?
[2022-12-23 15:05:57] <MaccaMover> No other manager would of came in and dropped our captain Maguire from the get go, foot down from the get go
[2022-12-23 15:05:58] <chewablealarm> @MGibson2004 No he wasnt lmao he sucked you went from 2nd with Rashford to Thursday cup. You literally got rid off him to rebuild after signing him the year before Dumb signing
[2022-12-23 15:05:58] <+marnzzz> and look at what casemiro haas done to our team
[2022-12-23 15:05:59] <+Jhaytch1> We were buzzing when Donny came cos he was a baller at Ajax then never gets a game for us he doesn’t perform
[2022-12-23 15:06:05] <chewablealarm> Maguire was another lmao
[2022-12-23 15:06:10] <diggydoolans> Van der bench*
[2022-12-23 15:06:10] <AussieRig> cr7 wasnt a good signing long term

[2022-12-23 15:07:17] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> vvd influenced his price so much LUL leicester made utd think he was worth as much as vvd
[2022-12-23 15:07:20] <lfcnathann> wan bissaka's fall off has been weird
[2022-12-23 15:07:22] <%+TLC1207> mcmuffin is in the team because you needed height, and he's a passion merchant, not united quality
[2022-12-23 15:07:25] <%+Skovzy> lool 55 shooting
[2022-12-23 15:07:26] <AussieRig> pity about greenwood, cause he was looking like the future
[2022-12-23 15:07:26] <Tyronis8> Best st to go with mbappe not r9
[2022-12-23 15:07:30] <adamsquires11> No dont get me wrong, busquets is good... but he's had such a blessed career

[2022-12-23 15:07:34] <+Trigonda> spain always had blessed midfielders
[2022-12-23 15:07:38] <shady0003> Would you sell Maguire now? After the WC his price certainly has gone up. Best time to sell him.
[2022-12-23 15:07:48] <+jbfut_> Tchou looks unreal for france future
[2022-12-23 15:08:06] <adamsquires11> bro has never had a midfield he's needed to carry, his role could be done by a lot of players
[2022-12-23 15:08:09] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> would u sell for 30M?
[2022-12-23 15:08:11] <%addhyany12> calling busquets blessed wtf
[2022-12-23 15:08:12] <%+iFearIess> Riquelme said it best when it came to Busquets.
[2022-12-23 15:08:15] <%$shaquille_oatmeal110> WW Mctominay leaked Pherrif
[2022-12-23 15:08:17] <Ad_aamm> they had xavi iniesta before that
[2022-12-23 15:08:20] <+marnzzz> @shady0003 not really, we got knocked out early
[2022-12-23 15:08:20] <MaccaMover> if you could get anything over 25m for Maguire sell him
[2022-12-23 15:08:20] <+calfreezing> United should have just bought Alderweireld for Mourinho or even in 2019. Far better CB and would be on way less wages and probably moved on for Varane
[2022-12-23 15:08:22] <diggydoolans> If Spain had a Villa or Torres they would have won the World Cup
[2022-12-23 15:08:29] <lfcnathann> you'd defo need a replacement tho varane gets injured every week

[2022-12-23 15:09:05] <MaccaMover> Depends how long he got on his contract
[2022-12-23 15:09:05] <adamsquires11> I think they can hold out for like 140 odd
[2022-12-23 15:09:06] <+marnzzz> madrid are trying to snatch all of the young stars lmao
[2022-12-23 15:09:06] <eddarrd> theyll make all these shitters 85 rated so the guaranteed pick from swaps is littered with them
[2022-12-23 15:09:12] <+kingdreezytv> 120m
[2022-12-23 15:09:19] <shady0003> @shady0003 @marnzzz Still he was one of your best player in the WC
[2022-12-23 15:09:24] <%zakki16> 2 accounts?
[2022-12-23 15:09:25] <%zozo6x> I would say 140m

[2022-12-23 15:09:34] <lfcnathann> yes
[2022-12-23 15:09:40] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> everything up to 160M is money well spent imo
[2022-12-23 15:09:41] <+kingdreezytv> i would rather have enzo for 90m
[2022-12-23 15:09:45] <MaccaMover> Depends how many years left on his Dortmund contract
[2022-12-23 15:09:51] <namanjohari> we need to plan for our 20th ucl soon
[2022-12-23 15:09:51] <%+domyyb7> Will he stay whereever he goes tho?
[2022-12-23 15:09:54] <%+Skovzy> but you only get to say no to tito floren once!
[2022-12-23 15:09:55] <lfcnathann> i dont think hes worth 140 ngl
[2022-12-23 15:09:56] <+marnzzz> @shady0003 yes but his price isnt going to go up by much mate
[2022-12-23 15:09:57] <chewablealarm> Thats never the case though
[2022-12-23 15:09:59] <AussieRig> depends on the club lol
[2022-12-23 15:10:02] <%+Harwoodinho> Just got back, when did we take an L?
[2022-12-23 15:10:06] <+littlelewis7> enzo is a dangerous buy
[2022-12-23 15:10:11] <+littlelewis7> one good world cup doesnt make him world class
[2022-12-23 15:10:19] <+littlelewis7> look at james, and gotze
[2022-12-23 15:10:20] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> u gotta think u can have 10-15 years of him in your club or 5 years and sell him for a huge chunk again
[2022-12-23 15:10:23] <+marnzzz> @shady0003 we paid 80 million for him and hes been a flop, do you thiunk  a team is going to pay 60 million for him?

[2022-12-23 15:10:36] <%+DaveBling> in today's market he's definitely worth 120m. He will only get a lot better and as he's English he's always going to be priced more

[2022-12-23 15:10:58] <namanjohari> musiala is one of the best dribblers in the world currently
[2022-12-23 15:10:59] <%+Skovzy> please don’t compar emusiala tu bellingham different levels
[2022-12-23 15:10:59] <amilcarfacadas> haaland maybe
[2022-12-23 15:11:00] <%addhyany12> he's the best of the 3 (musiala)
[2022-12-23 15:11:05] <adamsquires11> takes 3 man pressing him

[2022-12-23 15:11:33] <%+Skovzy> bellingham is clear of musiala
[2022-12-23 15:11:34] <adamsquires11> Pedri gotta be in that conversation
[2022-12-23 15:11:36] <+littlelewis7> musiala has the highest cieling

[2022-12-23 15:11:42] <+littlelewis7> i think bellingham is better currently

[2022-12-23 15:11:45] <+immortalcomboz> with  passssion

[2022-12-23 15:12:06] <%xylexxy> i love pedri and gavi but im a barca fan
[2022-12-23 15:12:07] <+Trigonda> Madrid just paid 60m for a 16 year old, double for Bellingham at 19 seems realistic
[2022-12-23 15:12:07] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> musiala was ELITE
[2022-12-23 15:12:10] <+KennyyMeister> Bellingham, Musiala, Pedri imo
[2022-12-23 15:12:16] <Creepy__23> His finishing was terrible

[2022-12-23 15:12:34] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> bellingham running englands midfield as our player of the tourney, gavi the 3rd youngest wc goalscorer, musiala getting a plane home because he cant get a goal he doesnt move me
[2022-12-23 15:12:36] <%RiceFL> tchuameni is one of the best mids i reckon

[2022-12-23 15:13:03] <scar1zz> Chat shud i Get ptg gomez, griezmann or saeed ali owairan for striker?
[2022-12-23 15:13:06] <%addhyany12> 1 Musiala 2 Jude 3 pedri( for me)
[2022-12-23 15:13:08] <shady0003> @shady0003 @marnzzz My point is this is the best time to get a better price to sell him. He isn't the first choice CB for Ten Hag anyway.
[2022-12-23 15:13:08] <adamsquires11> Camavinga is wild

[2022-12-23 15:45:54] <smokeshotjmd> @rygn922 isnt who all are on a 5+ win streak can match no matter how high
[2022-12-23 15:46:05] <stepbro_saelv> my advice is to practice rushing at the opponent a lot to get better at it
[2022-12-23 15:46:13] <MaccaMover> No way he’s not quitting
[2022-12-23 15:46:16] <!%Daanfc> no way thus guy is making a sub when 4-0 doen
[2022-12-23 15:46:21] <stepdro> Mans is drippin’ with pride
[2022-12-23 15:46:22] <adamsquires11> @adamsquires11 Idk the guy I played at 19-0 last week rage quit a 3-0 so doubt he was 19-0, I played a pro at 15-0 on his alt account but other than that, matchmaking was pretty chill
[2022-12-23 15:46:26] <vegarking> I highly doubt that's how matchmaking work @rygn922
[2022-12-23 15:46:33] <%legalcookie_> In a bit stokes I’m going for a nap

[2022-12-23 15:47:49] <%rygn922> i think people rubber band because if they rage quit it dont count towards the form in matchmaking?

[2022-12-23 16:28:17] <+gusmcld> This is a glitch that can happen when you quit but it crashes at HT, this is a cheater using a cheat engine.  EA could stop it but....

[2022-12-23 16:30:11] <diggydoolans> Cross play on old gen but no p. Players
[2022-12-23 16:30:16] <martspijkerman> Wow
[2022-12-23 16:30:17] <BRIINCE> How does sbmm work in WL?
[2022-12-23 16:30:21] <aman4311> Its surely an AI buts its weird one with AI pausing for w a while in between the gameplay..
[2022-12-23 16:30:23] <ganzanol> its ultimate difficulty AI
[2022-12-23 16:30:23] <%+Skovzy> lloww it
[2022-12-23 16:30:25] <%Deepjhl> That is actually painful man
[2022-12-23 16:30:26] <!%Daanfc> Hope these guys get castrated
[2022-12-23 16:30:27] <martspijkerman> What kind of cross or pass would that even be
[2022-12-23 16:30:27] <+LucidHimself> @mikael_the_mod haha what are you on about
[2022-12-23 16:30:31] <bigmoosrs> joke of a game...
[2022-12-23 16:30:37] <%jordan_g1888> Turn crossplay off again mate
[2022-12-23 16:30:42] <ly7z__> It’s impossible to beat this AI, I just quit. That way they don’t get a win lol
[2022-12-23 16:30:44] <bigmoosrs> can't believe EA cant fix this
[2022-12-23 16:30:55] <%Dzoney_> That’s an extremely unfortunate loss Stokes, even though you outplayed him on every possible level he still beat you, I have never seen anyone as unlucky as you that match, nor anyone as lucky as he was that match. It shouldn’t even be legal for someone as bad as them to beat someone as amazing as you are at this game.
[2022-12-23 16:30:55] <seantech75> cross play is actually shite
[2022-12-23 16:30:56] <ControlWarrior> congratz to EA creating such powerful AI

[2022-12-23 16:37:56] <amanduzmb> I tested the AI. There is a guy Lonzia on Elitepvpers, which sell it for 60$. It’s so easy to just get 20:0 it’s ridiculous
[2022-12-23 16:38:00] <Laterskater8> you cant blame all pc guys tho.
[2022-12-23 16:38:02] <beeson32> i have 94 r9 and would swap him for gold mbappe if i could

[2022-12-23 16:38:52] <CameronMcwilliam1> Surely EA could make it so the AI turns into beginner if it’s used in champs
[2022-12-23 16:38:52] <ControlWarrior> on average a PC player will be better than PS5 xbox player. we dont have pro . if in my WL i meet people from XBOX or PS5 usually i end up in high 16 wins you guys just cant defend

[2022-12-23 16:39:40] <amanduzmb> It’s very overpowered the AI. I tested it with 150k team and got 20:0 WL
[2022-12-23 16:39:40] <martspijkerman> I didn’t have any AI issues but I turned of crossplay very early on bc of crazy speedup lag
[2022-12-23 16:39:41] <eddarrd> 18 packs and my 84 picks from WL saved for 6

[2022-12-23 16:40:18] <martspijkerman> Same as people saying na servers are way harder than eu servers
[2022-12-23 16:40:22] <+LucidHimself> I think avg on PC excluding pros probably better than console
[2022-12-23 16:40:25] <ControlWarrior> @hashtag_stokes  i said nothing about pro . i said just average player
[2022-12-23 16:40:25] <%+jogabonito771> beautiful!
[2022-12-23 16:40:25] <+kubakubak11> avarage maybe yes because on ps5 there is like 5 times more player thats why

[2022-12-23 16:40:27] <ganzanol> there are more casual's on console, pc is hardder

[2022-12-23 16:40:51] <+LucidHimself> @davidmurrayy_ i get 18-2 - 19-1

[2022-12-23 16:41:13] <ControlWarrior> @hashtag_stokes  PC not allowed to have pro players  so you are an outlier

[2022-12-23 16:41:23] <+mikael_the_mod> we are snowflakes apparently so PC player has to be better
