[2022-12-16 20:04:15] <%+Heronik_> the soloq escape streak goes hard
[2022-12-16 20:04:18] <%Katie0nCrack> maybe they have an escape streak, or an archive
[2022-12-16 20:04:21] <%+friendlygoosehere> why inst the portret of billy red like the other killers who are p10 has red?
[2022-12-16 20:04:24] <%Florime_> soloq escape streaks like that have no value tho

[2022-12-16 20:05:45] <%Florime_> when the streak gets high you get the 2 camps of ppl wanting to troll and ppl wanting to help
[2022-12-16 20:05:49] <%Katie0nCrack> no hit nemesis, only use zombies streak Kappa

[2022-12-16 20:09:26] <ragan8888> both feel cheap to play compared to 90% of the killer cast

[2022-12-16 20:09:31] <+DaveWilsea> Even though she’s worse I feel spirit is still easier to do things perfectly with
[2022-12-16 20:09:34] <%Katie0nCrack> blight takes skill, nurse takes at least 2 semi-functioning hands
[2022-12-16 20:09:39] <BathrobeHero_> with nurse you need to play it right once, with blight it's everytime
[2022-12-16 20:09:41] <%+globo12343> @eithw_ yeah I had a nurse whiff on me 10 times and she tunneled me out then said ez KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:09:45] <tajamas> blight def feels like he deserves to be as powerful as he is, excluding the broken addons

[2022-12-16 20:10:03] <%+murphyslaw55> @hens333 old spirit was easy
[2022-12-16 20:10:06] <SquiddToph> billy is the hardest killer, prove me wrong Kappa
[2022-12-16 20:10:06] <%+globo12343> harder than nurse? why is that?
[2022-12-16 20:10:10] <%Katie0nCrack> nah, nurse is definitely harder than spirit COPIUM
[2022-12-16 20:10:11] <+DaveWilsea> Huh maybe I just get bad survivors on my spirit games lol
[2022-12-16 20:10:11] <Mercurial42> you need ears

[2022-12-16 20:10:36] <raidchadowlegend> I hate playing Billy on ps4
[2022-12-16 20:10:37] <archol123> I struggle more with the hearing on spirit than anything else

[2022-12-16 20:10:59] <BreadAccountant> spirit used to be easier and nurse used to be mechanically harder
[2022-12-16 20:11:04] <%EvilD34d> @worldstarkpop spirit is decently harder after her nerf...still very strong though
[2022-12-16 20:11:07] <kumieram_slay> bugged sounds on eyrie of crows i love it

[2022-12-16 20:11:23] <Mercurial42> I still really dislike that they gave nurse multiple buffs when they "rewrote" her
[2022-12-16 20:11:26] <SquiddToph> lol
[2022-12-16 20:11:28] <worldstarkpop> like i play vs so many spirits who will NEVER phase unless i'm injured and it's funny
[2022-12-16 20:11:35] <worldstarkpop> because they get away with it vs my teammates
[2022-12-16 20:11:40] <%+globo12343> is spirit harder just because of the directional phasing or did her mechanics also get harder as well?

[2022-12-16 20:13:39] <%EvilD34d> @Mercurial42 which buffs are talking about?
[2022-12-16 20:13:49] <SquiddToph> people hate 3rd objectives, they just want gen and chase, no box
[2022-12-16 20:13:56] <%Blessedcow> The last time I played pinhead 2 people dced as well
[2022-12-16 20:14:02] <LaniDude91> Yikes
[2022-12-16 20:14:17] <LaniDude91> What is it with survivors and their offerings lately
[2022-12-16 20:14:17] <%eithw_> we're all desperate for that rpd achievement
[2022-12-16 20:14:22] <%Katie0nCrack> i had a game against a 4 BNP squad once where i kept the game at 5 gens cuz i constantly guessed the box location correctly, pinhead can be brutal. they were a very tough team
[2022-12-16 20:14:22] <SquiddToph> map offerings don't even need to exist
[2022-12-16 20:14:23] <%eithw_> my friends have 5 more left
[2022-12-16 20:14:32] <%+xandertje10> who thought this achievement was a good idea
[2022-12-16 20:14:36] <%+globo12343> @SquiddToph tbh i wouldn't hate him so much if my key bindings on controller are better. It always makes me go into a locker than vault. Ppl tell me to change them but they don't realize steam isnt too friendly for controller users
[2022-12-16 20:14:36] <%+xandertje10> the offerings will never stop
[2022-12-16 20:14:45] <%Meurial> whats the achievement?
[2022-12-16 20:14:45] <big_chungus451> u think u could break down the timing for the demo survivor teleport
[2022-12-16 20:14:46] <boulder_puncher91> but hens I need 8 more escapes on rpd
[2022-12-16 20:14:47] <archol123> what achievement?
[2022-12-16 20:14:58] <%+globo12343> ok but why do ppl want the achievement so bad? like i never saw ppl going so hard on achievements before
[2022-12-16 20:15:01] <%EvilD34d> @archol123 open the gate and escape from rpd
[2022-12-16 20:15:04] <+suIIyboy> @squiddtoph I don't mind them as a concept, but Pigs is boring since it's based off RNG, and Pinheads is fine if SoloQ could coordinate it somehow.
[2022-12-16 20:15:05] <adnips> i think i play less games without map offerings these days

[2022-12-16 20:19:32] <%+globo12343> tbh i find it funneh when ppl say gg ez to killers when they bring a map offering, 2 BNP, and rly strong perks KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:19:43] <+suIIyboy> @iq_is_bae Lerys also has good gate spread.  I'd hate to be sent to an indoor, but I might actually play a game of Lerys out
[2022-12-16 20:20:23] <Hero_Kiki> I know you can't really do that sicne you're streaming, but I just task manager close the game if I see the RPD offering

[2022-12-16 20:23:27] <+DaveWilsea> I don’t think it’s the worst indoor map honestly, at least after the rework
[2022-12-16 20:23:39] <BreadAccountant> rpd suuuuucks
[2022-12-16 20:23:41] <%+ForestGrandpa> Survivor main speaking probably OMEGALUL
[2022-12-16 20:23:45] <adnips> it's an 'immersive' map :)
[2022-12-16 20:23:48] <BathrobeHero_> I love resident evil but rpd just makes me sad with how much I hate the map
[2022-12-16 20:23:48] <%dannyhallam> west wing is busted for survivor
[2022-12-16 20:23:53] <%Katie0nCrack> i used to love new RPD, as killer, until people started realizing it's a second gideon meatplant
[2022-12-16 20:23:55] <%+globo12343> @LiterallyNobody_ for me, it's The Game. Ik RPD may be worse for others but the fact that I tend to run mostly m1 killers, the game is harder for me counter against rly safe pallets
[2022-12-16 20:23:57] <viperstingyou> I like playing nurse on that map
[2022-12-16 20:23:57] <%$mary_6559> i preferred old RPD map

[2022-12-16 20:24:03] <+suIIyboy> AESTHETICALLY, I could agree it's great.  Gameplay, it's the worst lol.
[2022-12-16 20:24:08] <ragan8888> @Hens333 It feels like they are trying to make maps that negate some killers and allow others to flourish.
[2022-12-16 20:24:15] <%+haws3> wrost map is cowshed ez
[2022-12-16 20:24:17] <hexdrix> Yeah i honestly liked old rpd

[2022-12-16 20:24:19] <+DaveWilsea> I’d rather play RPD than the game honestly
[2022-12-16 20:24:27] <%+globo12343> @murphyslaw55 they rly should. Or decrease the chances survs get maps because it technically is 4 vs 1

[2022-12-16 20:24:37] <%+globo12343> survs get map offerings 4x more likely
[2022-12-16 20:24:37] <Consumer_Of_Crayons> I still think Haddonfield is worse than RPD
[2022-12-16 20:24:44] <hexdrix> Id rather play any indoor map most of the time
[2022-12-16 20:24:46] <BreadAccountant> its sad that most of the maps are not great
[2022-12-16 20:24:48] <%DarthGryffon> it just depends on the killer tbh like rpd and the game can work, just not with every killer
[2022-12-16 20:24:49] <%Katie0nCrack> @DaveWilsea as which killer?

[2022-12-16 20:26:21] <%+globo12343> @nordoooo i dont think so, i only heard about maybe stranger things coming back and the new tome being centered around the Forged in Iron chapter
[2022-12-16 20:26:28] <ragan8888> @BreadAccountant or if they changed it to one side picks tile set, one side picks the map. so if you pick corn map, the killer would always pick abattoir

[2022-12-16 20:29:48] <+Droidzqt> I think they need to change map offerings to instead make it so the offering prevents you from going to that map instead of choosing it

[2022-12-16 20:31:58] <%+globo12343> @pribzz i think it's because his hitbox is less forgiving than huntress

[2022-12-16 20:33:55] <+suIIyboy> @taykitty as unhelpful as this may sound, just listen.  Maybe turn audio up/music off if you have it.  Try and get used to looking audio queues such as footsteps, breathing, and slow vault audio.  You also wanna apply how you think a survivor would path as well.

[2022-12-16 20:36:16] <+suIIyboy> @taykitty that's actually not a terrible idea, to play with bots to try and recognize survivor audio.  However bots path very eradically compared to real ppl, so do keep that in mind.  Normal survivors aren't gonna immediately run edge map and play the z wall.  They also aren't win every single 50/50 at a downed pallets, which the bots do.
[2022-12-16 20:36:19] <Taykitty> @v1txminb yeah i've seen that when watching people play spirit, figured that's waht they were doing! NODDERS

[2022-12-16 21:12:30] <TheBoiMyers> @mary_6559 I personally enjoy Ghost Face. Getting free killer instinct on everyone within 36m just for activating Night Shroud is pretty cool.
[2022-12-16 21:12:31] <+suharos> @Hens333 He wants his Comp moment
[2022-12-16 21:12:31] <%whoaskedyouwu> Slug him for the VALUE

[2022-12-16 21:13:08] <@%Ana1661> Next patch notes will be "Whenever Hens333 choses a killer, that killer suffers from permanent 20% penalty to all of the actions and speed". Dk if that will be enough to stop you tho
