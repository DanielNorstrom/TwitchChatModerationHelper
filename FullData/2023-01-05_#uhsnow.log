[2023-01-05 12:30:50] <%+X_Strychnine_X> morning snowman
[2023-01-05 12:30:52] <BinBotPanda> wait how do you watch live sport in the UK?
[2023-01-05 12:30:55] <vincent_075> i have not watched tv in 10 years. that shit so boring.
[2023-01-05 12:30:56] <RavageFlame> we dont have that in australia thank fuck
[2023-01-05 12:30:58] <%GrumpyTreeFrog> whats a tv license?
[2023-01-05 12:31:00] <%+Danacky23> YES exactly. Only Live TV and BBC things you need it for
[2023-01-05 12:31:09] <ohta_nishio> I dont even have a tv LUL
[2023-01-05 12:31:10] <%+the_only_tetra> @BinBotPanda sky bt sport etc...
[2023-01-05 12:31:10] <$RoddBlack> If you don't have a license you can't watch BBC iPlayer either
[2023-01-05 12:31:14] <alex123wsb> need to buy one in Ireland even if its just a computer monitor, anything capable of getting live TV needs a licence
[2023-01-05 12:31:14] <@%Cosmic> I only watch youtube/netflix ect
[2023-01-05 12:31:14] <YoMolicheu> The internet?
[2023-01-05 12:31:16] <@%^StreamElements> Yo!  Don't like ads?  Don't feel like being a gigachad and subbing? Twitch Turbo is for you!  https://www.twitch.tv/turbo
[2023-01-05 12:31:19] <%themightyguss> i just stream sports anymore
[2023-01-05 12:31:21] <%Machatie> Internet streams curvyeEZ
[2023-01-05 12:31:22] <SheepsAholy> what??
[2023-01-05 12:31:23] <%+Ninj4Sheep> I think it's only BBC though, not any live TV
[2023-01-05 12:31:28] <%GrumpyTreeFrog> ohh
[2023-01-05 12:31:30] <+Kirbby2g> ??
[2023-01-05 12:31:30] <@%Christian2920> In Denmark, you have to pay that license as long as you have ANY device that can access the internet uhsSalt
[2023-01-05 12:31:43] <$moe_uwu> Yeah i was going to cancel my TV licence till it was pointed out to me that using BBCIplayer for the world cup and other sports live makes you still need one haha
[2023-01-05 12:31:44] <%+the_ackman> BBC is weird
[2023-01-05 12:31:44] <%+the_only_tetra> @themightyguss perfectly legally NODDERS
[2023-01-05 12:31:47] <+Kirbby2g> thats crazy
[2023-01-05 12:31:54] <%+carl_121> Just bbc bbc iplayer
[2023-01-05 12:31:54] <%$Rolling_Thunder197> paying a license to watch live TV is odd
[2023-01-05 12:31:54] <$RoddBlack> Yeah pretty sure you can watch BT Sport with their subscription but no TV License
[2023-01-05 12:31:55] <%StarAnjeLyn> @Christian2920 That's wild.
[2023-01-05 12:31:57] <KirkHasselen> @Christian2920 if the internet speed is higher then 128kbps :)

[2023-01-05 12:32:02] <@%^StreamElements> Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!

[2023-01-05 13:20:19] <kieranm_123> @crabbybear724 explain ?
[2023-01-05 13:20:25] <N1ne7y> Hey Chat. Did Snow complete the hacks from Jacob yet?
[2023-01-05 13:20:31] <ArenaKrusher> hopefully its just something where they have to leave for a while or womthing
[2023-01-05 13:20:40] <%+Leviwest> Hopefully someone can do a welfare check on them
[2023-01-05 13:20:44] <+JohnJKnapp> People sometimes love announcing their departure
[2023-01-05 13:21:02] <%SurreyHuntress> I’d come and say bye I think.  It I would explain.  Now we all think poor Crabby is in a bad way
[2023-01-05 13:21:06] <%Snairy> without context though, hard to know whats happened
[2023-01-05 13:21:07] <+Blekfast> Hey Snnu
[2023-01-05 13:21:11] <Bittereballen> thats fucked up to do that kinda stuff man
[2023-01-05 13:21:12] <shanef8> Good morning, Mr snow everthing good
[2023-01-05 13:21:13] <%Henrig> @Timmac In addition, what do you even do as a streamer... If you entertain it, it gives a lot of weird people a lot of ideas as to what they should expect from a streamer
[2023-01-05 13:21:14] <%+cocolori1> I suggest we move on in chat because we have no context
[2023-01-05 13:21:20] <%Senna_Mynx> peepoComfy
[2023-01-05 13:21:24] <%Henrig> @cocolori1 Good take

[2023-01-05 13:21:33] <%flatmilkstain> Reading stuff like that is scary, fucks people up
[2023-01-05 13:21:34] <%+the_only_tetra> its upsetting Sadge
[2023-01-05 13:21:37] <@%Christian2920> Let us know how you want it handled Snu

[2023-01-05 13:21:47] <Gxd10> snow did you make any progress in the hacker thing?
[2023-01-05 13:21:51] <@%Christian2920> I dont fucking know
[2023-01-05 13:21:59] <@%Christian2920> Yeah Crabby is a long time regular
[2023-01-05 13:21:59] <+ChaosHouse2> From personal and professional experience, people who did this don’t actually have any plan in place, they do it for attention
[2023-01-05 13:22:06] <KingCrighton> puts you as the streamer in a horrible position as people will clip what you say out of context. hope they're ok

[2023-01-05 13:22:18] <d__rek> Evreyone should probably report self harm. Amazon should have teams that handle this stuff
[2023-01-05 13:22:23] <+Funsized> do you guys believe in birds?
[2023-01-05 13:22:27] <litas_elitas> FEMLY
[2023-01-05 13:22:34] <sunfire1202> the real question is does crabby normally type things like that
[2023-01-05 13:22:34] DELETED: d__rek (Evreyone should probably report self harm. Amazon should have teams that handle this stuff)
[2023-01-05 13:22:35] <%+the_only_tetra> @Funsized not now
[2023-01-05 13:22:36] <%Snairy> Exactly, its not fair on the streamer and chat to load onto.IMO though, for anyone struggling, there is a lot of resource online
[2023-01-05 13:22:36] <%+Danacky23> You don't know if it is something - or just attention but assuming the latter then it is worrying. Just hope all is good ! We can't do anything only smile and say help is out there.
[2023-01-05 13:22:36] <%+Emaykurrz_> were they in the discord or anything?

[2023-01-05 13:26:03] <%+Danacky23> Sorry ! - Just hope all is well and the help is there if needed. Who knows as it's only the internet, we don't know them personally. If that makes sense
[2023-01-05 13:26:04] <wasdanny> @mind0fxero stay in line :)
[2023-01-05 13:26:05] <%+the_only_tetra> seek proffesional help chat if you are having any worrying feelings etc...
[2023-01-05 13:26:06] <Catainia> reporting it is the best way if he has prime or has ever bought a sub they have his address
[2023-01-05 13:26:07] <kpt_thizzer> which mustang do you like more, this or your oldie? @uhSnow
[2023-01-05 13:26:07] <%+cocolori1> It's bad because then we can all say 'don't worry about it, you can't help' but you can't force yourself not to worry about it so that isn't helpful either
[2023-01-05 13:26:08] <+Umplawa> Not your responsibility, but the utmost we can do
[2023-01-05 13:26:09] <%Henrig> Setting the expectation for that is also really dumb

[2023-01-05 13:26:37] <%+ChaosHouse2> Nothing really, there isn’t any obligation for you. At most point them towards resources that can help them. In the end its their choice we as professionals can try to help them but if they don’t want it there isn’t much we can do
[2023-01-05 13:26:40] <mind0fxero> Sorry guys

[2023-01-05 13:26:44] <Fup160> do they expect all streamers to be qualified mental health experts? xD
[2023-01-05 13:26:50] <Kermint14> 100% agree
[2023-01-05 13:26:52] <sunfire1202> this is a place for entertainment not a place for therapy i think some people blurr the lines once they feel comfortable

[2023-01-05 13:27:04] <%taylomic> it's just the nature of depression, people lose their ability to cope rationally. they don't always have useful family or friends or access to professionals either

[2023-01-05 13:27:10] <%Snairy> @Fup160 I think a lot of those people just dont know who to speak to, or have limited friends etc
[2023-01-05 13:27:11] <Corolol> yeah its weird to many people see their streamer as friend/mentor

[2023-01-05 13:27:22] <Fup160> yeah fuck that dud
[2023-01-05 13:27:24] <GrOggilol> i guess alot of people that do that dont exactly have the resources around them and see you as an adult. Very understandable that you dont want to deal with that though
[2023-01-05 13:27:35] <ohta_nishio> Its hard too we dont know whats going on his personal life. Maybe he dont think of you as just a twitch streamer. Maybe trust issues, whatever.
[2023-01-05 13:27:37] <wittsy89> @uhsnow if you wanna talk about it, you can it's your chat...... I hope the guy is ok, but this is not the place to ask for help. @timmac  dictate the conversation in your own chat.... !!!
[2023-01-05 13:27:40] <%+cocolori1> It's the responsible position to take not to offer help or advice that you aren't qualified to give

[2023-01-05 13:28:23] <RyanV97> Part of it is probably the whole parasoical thing. They may feel like they have no one else they can go to, but since they spend alot of time in a stream that probably comfrots them, they seek the streamer. Not okay still imo, but idk
[2023-01-05 13:28:24] <madbrofocusx420> i mean ive gone alot trough i mean depression and i just tell people what worked for me telling my experiences how i fought and stuff
