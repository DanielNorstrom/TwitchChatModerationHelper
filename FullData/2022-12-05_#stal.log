[2022-12-05 11:37:40] <%HalCynical> I think u should really take a look at AmphibiousAmphibian, while he does make YT vods special to YT, he really only plays games and thusly reviews them or play them in ways fun to him, he just narrates his experience, i could be getting the wrong vibe

[2022-12-05 11:41:43] <%HalCynical> This is gonna come off weird, but I think u can do alot in terms of using ur stream highlights and narrating over them or ur journeys and makeing those into vods, maybe get a volunteer editor stalalaNotes
[2022-12-05 11:41:52] <%Dwarfarrior> I've been really lucky with my static, joined them back in wow almost 10 years ago and most of the core group that I've vibed with has stayed together even after going to ffxiv. I care a lot more about that vibing than their performance
