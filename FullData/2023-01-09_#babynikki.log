[2023-01-09 20:19:06] <Stasis_Banki> Hi, I just started learning Japanese a couple of days ago and I was wondering how you retain the words you learn?
[2023-01-09 20:19:15] <Sawlzy> MYAAA
[2023-01-09 20:19:20] <%+GevoArt> The rigging is the most expensive part I think
[2023-01-09 20:19:22] <@%Sheffybun> it's not expensive if you learn how to draw or rig it yourself
[2023-01-09 20:19:31] <Stasis_Banki> I have a 95% passing rate but feel like I remember 20% of the words
[2023-01-09 20:19:38] <dannahxoxo> interesting
[2023-01-09 20:19:46] <@%Sheffybun> @GevoArt the art is usually more expensive than rigs

[2023-01-09 20:20:47] <Coinbird> but chat is not always smart or useful luaDevil
[2023-01-09 20:20:57] <linykaa> making the art for a vtuber model is so tedious too bc each part that you want to move or look like its moving has to be a separate layer in your art program NODDERS

[2023-01-09 20:25:04] VIEWERS: 825
[2023-01-09 20:25:08] <@%Sheffybun> @linykaa some artists really enjoy the cutting process, if anything the rig is usually more tedious than drawing the model
[2023-01-09 20:25:19] <@%Sheffybun> drawing it is typically the fun part
[2023-01-09 20:25:49] <jemsanity8> man i miss the pk so much. never touched the pk ever since it went to crafters

[2023-01-09 21:19:55] <%+jammerz777> Every key has stems, and I only used one type of switch, which was the silent linear cherry red switch. If you want different switches you could, but I think most people use only one type of switch on a keyboard. You could be multiple keyboards if you want with different switches on each
