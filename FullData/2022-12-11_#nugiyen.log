[2022-12-11 00:00:16] <kinky_jenkins> it is a heist node that gives him huck after opening a cache
[2022-12-11 00:00:51] <SusnOoOo> lmao how did i miss that one LOLW
[2022-12-11 00:01:15] <SusnOoOo> So you can just have an aura bot with you
[2022-12-11 00:01:17] <SusnOoOo> nice
[2022-12-11 00:01:25] <+str82maya> and than huck can be your aurabot?
[2022-12-11 00:01:33] <%+Weero> unfortunately it seems hucks items dont apply in maps
[2022-12-11 00:01:42] <SusnOoOo> aw
[2022-12-11 00:01:59] <%Eqimetheus> How does the Quest at Akt7 Works ? for me its Blocked off
[2022-12-11 00:02:20] <+str82maya> isn`t that making him useless?
[2022-12-11 00:03:24] <SusnOoOo> they hit it out the park with these new atlas passives
[2022-12-11 00:05:34] <prumpoe> which t3s are connected to residence?
[2022-12-11 00:05:40] <+ascended_exile> hows the metamorphs going?
[2022-12-11 00:05:51] <%Eqimetheus> ty vm

[2022-12-11 00:07:45] <randomflyingtaco> wait why did it send you to the wrong node?
[2022-12-11 00:07:47] <+niahboi> ye
[2022-12-11 00:07:48] <kuuura25> 1 is undoable
[2022-12-11 00:07:49] <kuuura25> go second
[2022-12-11 00:08:01] <+kreonkreon> It's like ES
[2022-12-11 00:08:02] <prumpoe> now that there's atlas skill tree, it seems to be really difficult to find the layout of atlas itself. No more karvarousku-atlastheory stuff
[2022-12-11 00:08:03] <SusnOoOo> @prumpoe sepulchre and phantas, but if you mean to vendor you can do with any t2

[2022-12-11 00:08:26] <MustDy> Inspiration is like ES, when it is hitted it is not counted to any resolve interactions

[2022-12-11 00:16:18] <BeautyBounce> Want to add that I'm on a 1060 with an average 30 fps.
[2022-12-11 00:16:20] <Slemsvamp> i'm two rooms away from that encounter, i'm scared now
[2022-12-11 00:16:26] <!%warfirev> rares are tooo rewarding... which is odd thing ti say
[2022-12-11 00:16:27] <BeautyBounce> I love to suffer.
[2022-12-11 00:16:36] <%+Adelbertt> Playing RF peepoSad
[2022-12-11 00:16:43] <%PeterCarl> rares are less scary, but somewhat tanky
[2022-12-11 00:16:43] <+Knorrjoppe> i died to her beam when i got there first time :(
[2022-12-11 00:17:02] <Slemsvamp> i have 250 resolve left :S and 0 inspiration
[2022-12-11 00:17:12] <@%DerangedM8> we all are a bit of a massochist, i mean we play a arpg by a company called GRINDING gear games KEKLEO
[2022-12-11 00:17:16] <Jiyva_> i stayed in the red crap too long on my attempt and failed
[2022-12-11 00:17:32] <+DeepRoots> u think ppl would have done the league mechanic if it didn't have op relics
[2022-12-11 00:21:43] <+MeFrank> wait why is huck with you?

[2022-12-11 00:22:57] <+DeepRoots> yea it's pretty fun, I have to say. I am hoping there will be more variety in rewards like six linked items etc..
[2022-12-11 00:23:07] <%Spiritual_Horse> i tought  you need kill all monsters to pass out a room :D how u understand dont need kill any mosnter and just rush to the end?

[2022-12-11 00:25:42] <+gokiters> What changed with Maven witnesses maps
[2022-12-11 00:26:38] <+xxpr0gamer420xx> !SC
[2022-12-11 00:26:45] <Jura27> did you grab anti regen mastery?
[2022-12-11 00:26:59] <+DJMC2> ryslatha + anti heal implicit?
[2022-12-11 00:27:01] <einhasad7> maybe get the new life mastery, you might get more than 2 regrets out of the monster
[2022-12-11 00:27:05] <%Dying_Sun_> you need disease vector
[2022-12-11 00:27:15] <+xxpr0gamer420xx> @nugiyen Any reason ur not playing HC?
[2022-12-11 00:28:19] <donshepard> jesus thats a tanky fish lady
[2022-12-11 00:31:04] <TheLogicFan> temp chain must be good in sanctum as well.
[2022-12-11 00:31:16] <%Kaleopan> if anybody is still looking for a chill build that does everything and needs nothing, i can recommend ancestral protector champion. its like warchief on steroids - totems get splash,  anc.call, impale, taunt etc. from tree and are a proper 6L now
[2022-12-11 00:31:46] <%Kaleopan> you get splash from tree
[2022-12-11 00:31:54] <%Kaleopan> instead of having a 5L because splash
[2022-12-11 00:32:59] <+AunupB> Aren't the samples the body parts or am I missing something?
[2022-12-11 00:33:29] <+MeFrank> I used it once in AN because there was a challenge and never done it again
[2022-12-11 00:33:30] <Jura27> they're basically extra morbs
[2022-12-11 00:33:34] <+AunupB> you would make morphs faster
[2022-12-11 00:33:36] <%kHron0S> yeah the samples are the end body parts
[2022-12-11 00:34:22] <%+Weero> @nugiyen for the life regen mobs, have you considered getting the new life mastery 50% reduce life regen for nearby enemies?
[2022-12-11 00:34:33] <+MeFrank> so much and so little at the same time LUL
[2022-12-11 00:34:50] <@FroMb> hey ,m8 :)
[2022-12-11 00:34:52] <Jura27> do you have enough parts to try to build some now?
[2022-12-11 00:35:22] <sause83> Chat anyone done Stage 4 Boss ? Has nugi done/tried it ?

[2022-12-11 11:56:35] <HawkBlade94> I agree on sanctum level desing
[2022-12-11 11:57:03] <@%DerangedM8> the bosses are easier than the rooms themselves imo
[2022-12-11 11:57:06] <@%DerangedM8> cuz of dodging

[2022-12-11 11:57:30] <Hendrixonfire> or they need to add some skill based events in sanctum like bells u have to press to distract bosses(can help melee)
[2022-12-11 11:57:48] <HawkBlade94> Resolve bar needs some SFX when is depleting.

[2022-12-11 12:01:42] <+Thyrist0r> a little proj speed goes a long way for pconc imo
[2022-12-11 12:01:53] <shecky88> yesterday i took that 40% reduced ms in sanctum, never again...
[2022-12-11 12:02:11] <Mathod> That was more of a joke but thanks for the answer. Starting league late and really tempted to go Concotion
[2022-12-11 12:02:28] <+yardsale_eight> @nugiyen how do you think your BPL spark scion would work for sanctum?
[2022-12-11 12:02:58] <+quizzlemanizzle> @shecky88 i assume you had the choice between bad, very bad and giga bad because yeah -40%ms might as well say "reset your run"
[2022-12-11 12:03:14] <Ignartz> omgHello How are we today?

[2022-12-11 12:04:52] <+Ramistein> why do you run without a weapon? What build is that
[2022-12-11 12:05:00] <Marghanis> Ignartz The dough though danDrool
[2022-12-11 12:05:22] <@%DerangedM8> @Ramistein poison concoction doesn't let you use a weapon
[2022-12-11 12:05:27] <Ignartz> @Marghanis The corners after cutouts go straight into the belly, not stopping in the oven first :D
[2022-12-11 12:07:37] <Ignartz> @nugiyen you considering leveling up a new build? Or were you just discussing upsides and downsides with this build?
[2022-12-11 12:08:25] <Mathod> Did a lot change for Poison concotion between 3.19 and now, most of the guides I found weren't updated aperently
[2022-12-11 12:08:42] <shecky88> @quizzlemanizzle was the second floor i think and just wanted to try it :)
[2022-12-11 12:08:46] <Ignartz> yeah, so I got hit with 40seconds ads right after my question :D
[2022-12-11 12:10:53] <Ignartz> It seems to be doing the job well

[2022-12-11 14:08:48] <hardin360> You can vendor a few Heart, Lung, Liver combos. You will get a brain or eye back. There is a bias against Eye and Brain so you are meant to vendor your badly rolled parts for them.
[2022-12-11 14:09:13] <TLdrc> so what are you suppose to do when witherstep is on? i can only run?
[2022-12-11 14:09:42] <+Extinctions90> @TLdrc yep and give mobs witheri stacks

[2022-12-11 14:10:27] <TLdrc> so tats all i want from withering. ic. i dont see any description about what cause it to cancel
[2022-12-11 14:10:36] <jogardar> for the totem build, you dont really need the ring effect for metamorph bosses, the boss room isnt that big, so you dont get that much benefit from the targeted nova effect
[2022-12-11 14:10:37] <steelangel_> you run ads any 30 min or is twitch?

[2022-12-11 14:14:52] <@%DerangedM8> or maybe i'm just mistaken YEP
[2022-12-11 14:15:48] <@%DerangedM8> oh no he doesn't

[2022-12-11 14:16:33] <@%DerangedM8> don't some people have different deals with twitch on that?
[2022-12-11 14:16:50] <@%DerangedM8> i c
[2022-12-11 14:17:07] <Ventrua> I think some very few selected ppl have deals
[2022-12-11 14:17:12] <Ventrua> like hasan runs ads once an hour
[2022-12-11 14:17:28] <@%DerangedM8> yea the big ones have a deal like that
[2022-12-11 14:17:29] <%KVahlman> Yeah, Cohh has a special deal where he doesn't have to run ads apart from start and end I believe. But he is a big time signed streamer so...
[2022-12-11 14:17:44] <Jobcontroller> ads in live content that doesn't really stop is another level of annoyment imo
[2022-12-11 14:17:55] <steelangel_> Nugi small pp need run more ads
[2022-12-11 14:18:05] <steelangel_> nugiBlow
[2022-12-11 14:18:06] <Overload42> Hasan has the lowest ad deal on twitch. he has 4 minutes per hour on his new contract, and in the precious he had 1 minute per hour
[2022-12-11 14:18:21] <+Kooters> I think as long as you run ads once every (under 60 minutes) it takes away random ads and prerolls.
[2022-12-11 14:18:36] <+Kooters> So the only ads are the ones you run every hour in that scenario
[2022-12-11 14:18:36] <Ventrua> nope

[2022-12-11 14:48:21] <%ampdecay> yeah
[2022-12-11 14:48:22] <FrankyF4Fingers> thats exactly what they said in the reveal OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 14:48:25] <+FeverPitch_> they should have marketed that better for the normies
[2022-12-11 14:48:29] <%+funta90> chris literally said that
[2022-12-11 14:48:35] <ResurrectionByElection> ppl dont know how roguelikes work - you dont beat them on the first runs, it takes a while
[2022-12-11 14:48:38] <%HeffU> Yeah, I think a small thing that would have helped is to have relics available easier/earlier, so it's obvious that you get them as meta progression
[2022-12-11 14:48:41] <+inuyaki> No, games with meta progression are rogue LITE, not rogue like
[2022-12-11 14:48:44] <iiiiiiiih108> its not worth time

[2022-12-11 14:49:59] <limbomon> I wish they consider different builds when they make any big changes/leagues.
[2022-12-11 14:50:03] <%+Digitking> if you block, do you still take resolve damage?
[2022-12-11 14:50:41] <%+kixn_n> dont hate on seismic trap, its weak skill :)
[2022-12-11 14:50:47] <+inuyaki> Yes, block, evasion, dodge do nothing for protecting resolve @Digitking
[2022-12-11 14:51:49] <+Satannogria> in every league ppl are mad because GGG nerfs skills.... now they didnt nerf seismic and ppl are mad because they DIDNT nerf it.... you cant win with this community KEKW

[2022-12-11 14:55:34] <igormoralinostroza> Hi nugi, just wanting to share something: I started hexblast/3 curse bane focusing on the hit portion, and the damage is decent, but the cast speed... Bane has 0,44, hexblast has 0,76. Its fucking stupid!!
[2022-12-11 14:55:40] <ryuukk__> it's more like "problem? there, one more shit to press", now you have to self cast curses, and now u have to use vaal skill

[2022-12-11 14:57:21] <+inuyaki> @Satannogria I am not one of those people, bec I am at a point where I don't care about PoE balance anymore. Just saying what I read and people are mostly mad that underused skills are shit for many leagues by now
[2022-12-11 14:58:14] <+Satannogria> @inuyaki 95% of underused skills are undersused because streamers didnt make an OP video guide around them.... it has almost nothing to do with balance
[2022-12-11 14:58:16] <igormoralinostroza> Nugi, if they bring down, which builds would take their places? They never do it properly. I want a league that Molten Strike, Glacial Hammer, Fireball, Purifying flame, etc, are the META. But they never do!

[2022-12-11 14:58:59] <+inuyaki> ok this is getting stupid... so you think pretty much every melee skill is fine right now? Do you even play this game? @Satannogria

[2022-12-11 14:59:18] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria i disagree, more skills are not played because they are just not fun to play, heavy strike is just not fun skill, it was designed 10 years ago
[2022-12-11 14:59:22] <ResurrectionByElection> they have. but it's in poe 2 Kappa
[2022-12-11 14:59:25] <%+CMF1972> Every new league I feel I want changes, I want it to feel different and make me do/try a new build.
[2022-12-11 14:59:58] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ i said 95%... thats in the 5%... you really cant name 5 more skills that are like that if you dont look them up
[2022-12-11 15:00:07] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria the fact that people need an OP guide for a skill so they play mean they are lured into wrong things (clearing/damage), people should pick a skill because it feels fun to play and scale properly
[2022-12-11 15:00:19] <ryuukk__> so 2 problems, not fun skill + poor balance and progression
[2022-12-11 15:00:56] <ishoa_> @MrBonkeyDollax Sry, late reply. I mean the body part wasn't available to build the metamorph at all.
[2022-12-11 15:00:56] <%Tnb87113> its ok POE is now a micro experiment on our societies and how whiny people are LUL
[2022-12-11 15:01:06] <ryuukk__> the fact that you need a separate skill for "leveling" means your main skill has a balance issue
[2022-12-11 15:01:18] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ not even close to that.... its just the whole meta thing and ppl being bad at the game because its very complex.... so most just follow guides and trends
[2022-12-11 15:01:30] <igormoralinostroza> @ryuukk__ Yeeea but ppl want to do end game content, and i would guess 10-25% of the player base knows how to scale damage properly. I'm still learning how to...
[2022-12-11 15:01:32] <Souchy7> @ryuukk__ no..
[2022-12-11 15:02:08] <%+davados_> I would like if they buffed and nerfed lots of skills each league to really mix the meta up
[2022-12-11 15:02:22] <%+Nannniii> i think everything should be able to do up until maven without mirror investement. like being able to do the story line
[2022-12-11 15:02:28] <Sernaph> no, some skills need investment to shine, or need to hit certain breakpoints, not all skills should be able to speedlevel through the story
[2022-12-11 15:03:16] <SuprMeatDude> no THIS
[2022-12-11 15:03:19] <%+CMF1972> I made 3 shitty builds last week and had so much fun trying to make them work.
[2022-12-11 15:03:30] <+Satannogria> which is exactly were PoE has been for the last few leagues.... with the exception of very few skills that get nerfed eventually
[2022-12-11 15:03:45] <igormoralinostroza> Going for a meta build, and nof an enjoyable build is a game design (a bad one), cus the game really starts when u beggin mapping, and most of the best itens are UBER locked...
[2022-12-11 15:04:37] <wanqiebs> bleed suck dick haha
[2022-12-11 15:04:45] <+Satannogria> they havent.... dot builds are trash for zooming and doing juiced deli maps for example.... it depends on what you want

[2022-12-11 15:05:17] <Kelvarion_> self-cast and melee have been bad more often than not going back years
[2022-12-11 15:05:20] <Souchy7> bows attacks are good 🤨
[2022-12-11 15:05:42] <%+Nannniii> makes me thiunk of mathil saying everything is viable when in reality he plays the same different skill around busted items mecanics
[2022-12-11 15:05:42] <ResurrectionByElection> is it a problem dot or with self-x tho
[2022-12-11 15:05:56] <ResurrectionByElection> also encounter design?

[2022-12-11 15:07:00] <SuprMeatDude> it's mostly bad
[2022-12-11 15:07:01] <igormoralinostroza> It is random nugi
[2022-12-11 15:07:07] <SuprMeatDude> there's like 1 boon per floor

[2022-12-11 15:07:28] <Slemsvamp> atleast that's my experience
[2022-12-11 15:07:57] <shecky88> why didnt you take chisels?
[2022-12-11 15:08:02] <%+Nannniii> @Satannogria every build i watch is around the same items, has to since he;s making so much build every league obviously but making an full shaper eternity shroud build is notfair to says a skill is viable for me for example
[2022-12-11 15:08:31] <%+Nannniii> @Satannogria he's also really good and has a lot of knowledge which allow him to do it but still not a fan of the everything is doable
[2022-12-11 15:09:17] <+Satannogria> he LITERALLY only does build like that once every 2-3 leagues....
[2022-12-11 15:09:25] <+DanthZ76> Fun ? HarvestDetected

[2022-12-11 15:10:09] <%+Nannniii> @Satannogria maybe but he does it on skill people says it';s viable viable mecanically or dmg wise to prove them wrong which doesn;'t prove much to me x)

[2022-12-11 15:12:11] <+Satannogria> @Nannniii because it is viable mechanically ? and he literally shows you how ? wtf are you talking about my dude... you picked 1 of his 50 builds and you're saying that all are almost the same KEKW
[2022-12-11 15:13:03] <+MrWhiteSkunk> Mathil is definetly good at making different build but it doesnt mean that skills are well balance in poe , far from it
[2022-12-11 15:13:06] <+Satannogria> and he always does that for fun... becuase its a challenge to gear up like that.... he never did it because its the only way for the skill to work
[2022-12-11 15:13:18] <%+Nannniii> @Satannogria we went from 2/3 per league to one lol i'm the problem here i give my vision. every league he does it multiple time. everything work doesn't mean it's mecanically okay.
[2022-12-11 15:13:46] <+Satannogria> @Nannniii i said 1 every 2-3 league... not 2-3 per league... read again

[2022-12-11 15:14:33] <Szili96> is the social aspect of poe when the toucan arrives?
[2022-12-11 15:14:42] <+MrWhiteSkunk> Im so mad i can't do league mechanic because i went for vaal cleave build and everything hits me in there
[2022-12-11 15:14:43] <+MrWhiteSkunk> SadgeSitSip
[2022-12-11 15:15:09] <%0bscureTTV> if you need mathil mechanics to make a skill just work then its not viable, if you can clear the campaign with it but not say shaber or elder or atziri (x boss) its not viable. if the definition of viable is you can equip it then ye sure everything is viable. but that aint how it is.
[2022-12-11 15:15:55] <@%Andrew756> hades player number are up 38% this weekend this is where all poe players are escaping (totally not because of the sale)

[2022-12-11 15:16:05] <+Satannogria> you dont need mathils mechanics.... the guy does uber bosses in new builds every 4-5 days... you cant compete with that obviously... @0bscureTTV
[2022-12-11 15:16:27] <%0bscureTTV> ok bro you go do maven with infernal blow then tell me its viable.
[2022-12-11 15:16:37] <%Dying_Sun_> @Andrew756 and the announcement of hades 2
[2022-12-11 15:16:49] <+Satannogria> infernal blow is actually a decent skill... at least name a skill that isnst ? KEKW
[2022-12-11 15:17:13] <igormoralinostroza> Nugi, the blood and sand that gives proj area of effect would be GOD tier ur build?
[2022-12-11 15:18:15] <+Satannogria> @0bscureTTV and again you're back to ignoring that not every skill should be amazing for all content.... there's skills that are better for bossing, others for clear, others for delve or blight
[2022-12-11 15:18:53] <%0bscureTTV> @Satannogria arguing semantics rather than the point of the sentences
[2022-12-11 15:19:34] <%0bscureTTV> obviously not every skill has the same role or goal/place in the game no one said that
[2022-12-11 15:20:25] <+Satannogria> @0bscureTTV that is not semantics lol... thats how the game works.... thats basics... every skill is better in some kind of content. Picking a skill that is meant to clear fast and saying "oh go do uber maven with that" is just stupid

[2022-12-11 15:21:02] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria so melee can't do anything?
[2022-12-11 15:21:23] <%+faijasmutsi> do you lose them on triggers?
[2022-12-11 15:21:30] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ most melee skills offscreen and are actually ranged
[2022-12-11 15:21:51] <%+faijasmutsi> i just always have use when full

[2022-12-11 15:22:06] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria sir, that's BS
[2022-12-11 15:22:31] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ go buy carries on TFT.... like 80% of them run melee builds for carrying uber bosses
[2022-12-11 15:22:45] <SuprMeatDude> I got 2 ephemeral edges today
[2022-12-11 15:23:03] <+Bradical13> is expedition/ heist best way to farm uber atziri in terms of getting frags?
[2022-12-11 15:23:06] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ best clear in the game or at least top3 is venom gyre... for juiced endgame maps. That is a melee skill
[2022-12-11 15:23:12] <@%Andrew756> just abandon this run nugi nugiCheck
[2022-12-11 15:24:14] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria that highlights the problem of the game more than anything, where everything is a multiplier that scales exponentially, the fact that you need 2 totem as a baseline for totem is the proof that the melee archetype is poorly designed
[2022-12-11 15:24:14] <Colorstrike> @Satannogria venom gyre isnt melee, its a prjectile skill
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <@%Andrew756> ez deal
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <%Dying_Sun_> galaxy brain
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <+Satannogria> @Colorstrike the playstyle is melee... you whirlwing on top of monsters to do dmg
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <@%Andrew756> definitely a deal in the history of trade deals
[2022-12-11 15:24:16] <%0bscureTTV> @Satannogria bro most people that are high ranked uber carries on tft have magebloods and ridiculous builds thats not even close to most the player base. what a pointless thing to say, this 3% of the player base can do it so there for im right.
[2022-12-11 15:24:16] <@%Andrew756> 32 resolve ICANT
[2022-12-11 15:24:30] <ryuukk__> place 2 totem, call 5 warcries, chung 5 flasks, blood rage, berseker, them spam your skill, you can one shot bosses like that, does that make melee properly designed?
[2022-12-11 15:25:06] <%+Nannniii> @0bscureTTV you're generous with 3% xD
[2022-12-11 15:25:13] <+Satannogria> @0bscureTTV that is to trivilaise content and do it with 5x hp because you are carrying more ppl.... if you dont want to onetap bosses with 5x hp you dont need that gear...
[2022-12-11 15:25:20] <%+Adelbertt> Morning peps
[2022-12-11 15:25:22] <kamro85> i like the dagger
[2022-12-11 15:25:40] <@%DerangedM8> dagger is pretty big
[2022-12-11 15:25:51] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria the fact that a skill can do billions of damage isn't the point of the discussion, you use trivialization of the game to prove your points
[2022-12-11 15:26:47] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ i am saying.... ppl solo carry 5man parties... that is the top end.... you DONT need that kind of gear. i am saying things are viable without that...
[2022-12-11 15:26:51] <+Bradical13> is expedition/ heist best way to farm uber atziri in terms of getting frags?
[2022-12-11 15:26:57] <Virel360> @nugiyen save up another whole floor before you run more imo
[2022-12-11 15:27:15] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria it's not the top end, it is abusing every mechanics possible, it's not a properly balanced nor is properly designed archetype
[2022-12-11 15:27:48] <%0bscureTTV> @Satannogria nearly all boss carries ever do it solo and call you in when they cull.
[2022-12-11 15:27:55] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ its called being good at the game.... its not abusing or anything else.... get your facts straight
[2022-12-11 15:28:00] <%0bscureTTV> they dont carry 5 man hp
[2022-12-11 15:28:16] <kamro85> toss a coin to your witcher
[2022-12-11 15:28:30] <sause83> should we ask nugi to move head ?
[2022-12-11 15:28:33] <ryuukk__> @Satannogria that's why everyone plays melee, it's a known fact, seriously..

[2022-12-11 15:29:47] <kamro85> i love cyclone but then i also play poe to have a good time and not to suffer
[2022-12-11 15:29:54] <%0bscureTTV> @ryuukk__ dont bother arguing dude he jsut hit you with the, just get good dont nerf my stuff get good noob attitude. dont waste your energy.
[2022-12-11 15:30:15] <kamro85> thats why i never play cyclone anymore Sadge
[2022-12-11 15:30:15] <+Satannogria> @ryuukk__ ppl dont play it because sometimes you have to actually get good while playing that.... getting good is not what most ppl or reddit are about
[2022-12-11 15:30:30] <ResurrectionByElection> HarvestDetected gotcha, lets make act 3 harder

[2022-12-11 15:31:00] <+Spawnbroker> I'm having a great time! What am I playing? Ice trap lul
[2022-12-11 15:31:27] <+Spawnbroker> yo it's so good
[2022-12-11 15:31:29] <+ffflippp> why?
[2022-12-11 15:31:32] <%axlex2> ice trap is for deep delvers, right
[2022-12-11 15:31:38] <kungfooe> ice trap is amazing.  play it almost every league.
[2022-12-11 15:31:40] <ReggaeSan> Creeping Frost totem is really good for the mechanic as well
[2022-12-11 15:31:43] <kungfooe> big deeps, chills/freezes
[2022-12-11 15:31:45] <+Bradical13> i wonder if vaal clave has the range for sanctum
[2022-12-11 15:31:52] <%+Nannniii> ice trap is good for the past 5 league x)
[2022-12-11 15:31:56] <+ffflippp> good to know
[2022-12-11 15:31:59] <%+Nannniii> but it's a trap again
[2022-12-11 15:32:12] <kungfooe> traps are love, traps are life
[2022-12-11 15:32:14] <ChigenTV> But its traps ye
[2022-12-11 15:32:21] <ChigenTV> biggest flaw^^
[2022-12-11 15:32:26] <Zayatani> Only problem with Ice Trap is the limited AoE, but being able to get Heatshiver and ignore Leadership's Price is INSANE
[2022-12-11 15:32:29] <+Satannogria> you talk about builds being boring and then you talk about ice trap.... KEKW
[2022-12-11 15:32:51] <+Satannogria> its a trap... what do you mean...
[2022-12-11 15:33:05] <jaktchorak> ice trap is fine, jsut the mapping feels awful
