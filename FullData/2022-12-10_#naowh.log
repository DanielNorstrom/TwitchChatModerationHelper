[2022-12-10 13:30:12] <infanti13> you think wars will get a nerf if so  what would be best tank after that
[2022-12-10 13:30:14] <%+ash19045> brew always scales the best with ilvl because of stagger
[2022-12-10 13:30:17] <svu3> brm not enough control over self healing. gotox not good enough

[2022-12-10 13:35:00] <shrake85> I think they're just playing it safe and prefer to buff people again instead of having to nerf them and they can no longer do the keylevel they were doing before. Something along those lines

[2022-12-10 13:40:32] <%+ash19045> this 10% nerf to dr doesnt affect warrior at all since most of the warriors doing m0s were sitting in battle stance, so they were missing 20% dr just from not being in defensive stance anyway

[2022-12-10 13:41:46] <iamveeli> ion said it offends the dev team when you say they act like they don't play the game themselves, but sometimes it really feels like wow devs aren't playing anything other than battle pets and mount farming simulators.
[2022-12-10 13:41:47] <+StixNBrickz89> Whats the add-on that shows rares/WQS
[2022-12-10 13:41:53] <%+ash19045> @ash19045 yes i know that, but warriors still have 20% dr to gain when they start sitting in defensive stance, no other tank has that

[2022-12-10 14:18:13] <%+madneezs> are there other there are going to the studio beside the raiders, like justwait?
[2022-12-10 14:18:14] <%+Marts1> I think if tnaks are gonna do alot of damage, they could bring back the Vengance thing so you can only have one tank in m+
[2022-12-10 14:18:21] <%Critzor> nerf shield block up time, make it a on demand dmg reduction during crazy phases

[2022-12-10 14:18:27] <kantras09> But does it really matter for people who just try to raid Normal/Heroic? I guess every tank is able to do that

[2022-12-10 14:18:47] <+dergaryy> if i play my pwar it feels like there is no way that I die.. but dh is more fun tho and has better util imo
[2022-12-10 14:18:48] <randompug12> so BDK is like on spot now?

[2022-12-10 14:19:21] <%+SmallDJoshy> @mayberoxy I wouldnt go that far, I just think they require a lot more effort to play
[2022-12-10 14:19:22] <+gentleman_wow> make take warr more dmg in battlestance
[2022-12-10 14:19:24] <%Vaca7a> if prot war starts taking alot of damage then the sustain is gonna become an issue
[2022-12-10 14:19:29] <+charchardubz> asmonFiend
[2022-12-10 14:19:33] <%+Marts1> maybe do that you take 20% more damage in dps stance?
[2022-12-10 14:19:37] <%+Marts1> or something arround that
[2022-12-10 14:19:40] <+PrimerinoTV> you lose so much damage going defensive stance
[2022-12-10 14:19:41] <%SyllehTV> But prot warriors dont have the same Leech as other tanks, and in M+ it will be difference, Prot warriors dont have the same Magic reduction as other tanks either, so there is no broken stuff here, Its M0 we talking about.
[2022-12-10 14:19:55] <%+Ridicule61> why nerf now when m+ is not even out yet
