[2022-12-18 00:00:36] <@Oxiomie> How you feeling by the way Grimm?
[2022-12-18 00:00:37] <%RinzaiGigen> Who voices the protagonist?
[2022-12-18 00:00:39] <!%$Nyanomancer> schlorp schlrop schlorp schloorp
[2022-12-18 00:00:42] <$InvertMouse> It's like when Grimmi kidnaps vtubers to interview them
[2022-12-18 00:00:48] <%RinzaiGigen> Also, Space is based.
[2022-12-18 00:00:49] <%GamingWhulphe> Yup
[2022-12-18 00:00:56] <%ughdontmakemeregister> oh my god yeah this is like an ironmouse interview isnt it
[2022-12-18 00:01:32] <$InvertMouse> Also like Grimmi, collects only vtubers
[2022-12-18 00:01:51] <%GamingWhulphe> We were talking about monetizing game choices.
[2022-12-18 00:02:14] <%newtonia09> for what reason? hmm.....
[2022-12-18 00:02:14] VIEWERS: 307
[2022-12-18 00:02:30] <%$Tempest_52> YOUR game choices
[2022-12-18 00:02:57] <%GamingWhulphe> They probably deal mostly with Batarian slaver f’ers.
[2022-12-18 00:02:59] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Corpse money from all the corpses they stole
[2022-12-18 00:03:02] <%newtonia09> BASED
[2022-12-18 00:03:02] <@%^Nightbot> based on what? grimmi14SmugGrimm
[2022-12-18 00:03:11] <!%$Nyanomancer> I wonder how they resurrected shepherd
[2022-12-18 00:03:24] <%dummy_dorko> thisu dude should button his collarr
[2022-12-18 00:03:37] <!%$Nyanomancer> Surely they didn't use funny reaper tech
[2022-12-18 00:03:43] <%GamingWhulphe> Surely
[2022-12-18 00:03:43] <%RinzaiGigen> DOSSIER ho ho ho. StinkyCheese
[2022-12-18 00:03:45] <%newtonia09> This guy is one of the few people who were taking initiative against the reapers
[2022-12-18 00:04:01] <%dummy_dorko> kind of makes sense, but they didnt shape the story that way
[2022-12-18 00:04:03] <%RinzaiGigen> Je thought it sounded chouette, as well.
[2022-12-18 00:04:10] <MisterKabukiMask> How do you know all this stuff Grim? How extensive was that LiveJournal?

[2022-12-18 00:04:19] <%dummy_dorko> grim is really mart
[2022-12-18 00:04:31] <%GamingWhulphe> Grim is hacker confirmed.
[2022-12-18 00:04:38] <%dummy_dorko> she doesnt need livejournal(???)
[2022-12-18 00:04:40] <thatstringfellow> here we go let's see if Wrex lived
[2022-12-18 00:04:50] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Grimmi that won't happen
[2022-12-18 00:04:50] <%dummy_dorko> idk who looked up game strats on live journal
[2022-12-18 00:05:01] <$InvertMouse> Grimmi with hidden knowledge grimmi14Rump
[2022-12-18 00:05:21] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I'm sure there's an archive somewhere.
[2022-12-18 00:05:24] <$InvertMouse> I remember the cut Illusive Man boss was in the artbook, which I read before finishing the game
[2022-12-18 00:05:30] <MisterKabukiMask> You saw the forbidden knowledge
[2022-12-18 00:05:34] <%GamingWhulphe> Kidnap the writer. Nodders. (Jk fbi bro)
[2022-12-18 00:05:40] <MautheDoog> i don't believe a single thing you ever say

[2022-12-18 00:05:46] <%LeonidasUmbra> FUCK "YEAH
[2022-12-18 00:05:53] <$InvertMouse> The writer was Grimmi
[2022-12-18 00:05:53] <@%Extrafuzzy> Chat We made it !
[2022-12-18 00:05:58] <%GamingWhulphe> No riot. le sad
[2022-12-18 00:06:03] <%RomeoEchoDelta> It's been more than 10 years any NDAs have long since expired.
[2022-12-18 00:06:12] <%ArcReaper_21> I remember the old Dark Energy ending theory. This game also has hints towards that.

[2022-12-18 00:07:01] <%GamingWhulphe> With the right mods you can kiss anyone.
[2022-12-18 00:07:10] <Pond_water> I like to think the Illusive Man did it on purpose.
[2022-12-18 00:07:17] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I feel like this intro mission was changed somewhere in development.
[2022-12-18 00:07:24] <%RinzaiGigen> I love games with dialogue options.
[2022-12-18 00:07:30] <thatstringfellow> They realized people liked the alien companions over the humans
[2022-12-18 00:07:41] <%GamingWhulphe> Humans are lame.

[2022-12-18 00:08:34] <%GamingWhulphe> Mordin singing is best.
[2022-12-18 00:08:34] <thatstringfellow> Question do you consider Mordin as an old man?
[2022-12-18 00:08:41] <!%$Nyanomancer> Do you cuddle with mordin as you sleep
[2022-12-18 00:08:45] <%newtonia09> I also love his character arc

[2022-12-18 00:08:55] <$InvertMouse> ME2 character creation theme was a banger
[2022-12-18 00:09:00] <%GamingWhulphe> Mordin even says he’s an old man.
[2022-12-18 00:09:14] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @nyanomancer EA isn't Nintendo and they wouldn't have any leg to stand on in a US court.
[2022-12-18 00:09:22] <!%$Nyanomancer> Neither does nintendo
[2022-12-18 00:09:25] <%RinzaiGigen> I get spaced on this stream.

[2022-12-18 00:10:36] <thatstringfellow> I love Wrex reaction when he sees you too

[2022-12-18 01:13:50] <$SaltyJub> @SaltyJub No, but it's awkwardly hiding everything it attempts to speak up about. As an example Mass Effect, and a lot of other games that came out in this era, attempted to feature queer representation. And they did, but they did it in an embarrassed "hide it away" kind of manner. It's not hamfisted, but it IS awkward
