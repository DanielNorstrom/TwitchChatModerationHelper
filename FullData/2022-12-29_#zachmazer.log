[2022-12-29 21:20:39] <%pray4jeremy> Zach said that he hit them up but theyre ‚Äúlooking in a different direction rn‚Äù
[2022-12-29 21:20:52] <%pray4jeremy> Lowkey i think he would be one of their best options as an IGL

[2022-12-29 21:21:21] <+jordand198> Surely Snipe ain't going to igl. I know he wants to try but na. They need an established igl and there ain't many around
[2022-12-29 21:21:34] <%pray4jeremy> I feel like thats what theyre gonna end up doing
[2022-12-29 21:21:42] <%pray4jeremy> I dont have much faith in Snipe igl either
[2022-12-29 21:21:59] <+jordand198> Snipe igl being so rusty at the game in general does not sound like the play
[2022-12-29 21:22:03] <mp0wer2> sniepdown needs to retire allready
[2022-12-29 21:22:25] <+jordand198> Na Snipe is crazy, as a fragger he'll be great

[2022-12-29 21:23:38] <disspite> I think they should give him time to test it out instead of co igl
[2022-12-29 21:23:38] <+DeaconKnox> snipe's in a form rut. went from halo right into quals. needs a split to just re-set. he'll be fine

[2022-12-29 21:28:00] <+DeaconKnox> well, it's a team thing. it's not about lying, it's about big upping yourself while the team struggled. it sits wrong. Not hating, sometimes people don't want to recognize individual performance in a team setting
[2022-12-29 21:28:04] <+ELI_2100> he probably watch c9 for a total of 10 minutes at that lan to form this opinion
[2022-12-29 21:28:07] <%altheclipper> hope you get some good offers
[2022-12-29 21:28:40] <+ktcantball> I mean as a professional you show maturity
[2022-12-29 21:28:48] <xHeadbusta43x> What type of position are you lookin for Zach? Igl or just like a spot on a team
[2022-12-29 21:29:00] <%+DaceFPS> I think the post is picking at you saying "MY performance" rather than 'OUR performance'.
[2022-12-29 21:29:03] <+mark_alot787> I wanted to see more c9 with knoqd

[2022-12-29 21:39:49] <%+witz_krackerz> i havent seen anyone talk about it before, but did PVP leave C9 because the org was leaving, or because DZ came in with a better offer?
[2022-12-29 21:40:10] <%madsxogaming> @witz_krackerz he said it was bc they gave him an offer he couldnt logically refuse
[2022-12-29 21:40:10] <+DeaconKnox> yeah, I know. Just, him knowing he can't travel for any lans and still trying to be on comp is a weird move. But, yeah, he's def thriving. Lou just sort of threw some stuff away
[2022-12-29 21:40:10] <%sau5ages> @jrench208 lou pulls 1000+ viewers everytime he streams he‚Äôs chilling

[2022-12-29 21:45:20] <+DeaconKnox> @confident_cake no worries. gonna be hard to see it all but he really only taks about it in between games so with a scroll, should be able to find the relevant stuff. basically he was just disappointed by the top comment and talked about how it was not entirely truthful and misleading
[2022-12-29 21:45:21] <%pray4jeremy> His biggest issue is his mental

[2022-12-29 22:56:41] <%DylanTheDonohoe> @flynnt_lasermaki pc is .4 or 40% aim assist, console is .6 60%
[2022-12-29 22:57:15] <flynnT_lasermaki> why does console have more aim assist? aren't the controllers basically the same?
[2022-12-29 22:57:17] <DemiCameron> @DylanTheDonohoe Imma be honest I've played console for nearly 4 years and I just swapped to PC 3 weeks ago and .4 aim assist to me is just as strong if not stronger than .6 to me at least
[2022-12-29 22:57:24] <skattankala> im just gonna say it, i hate talented mnk ppl get benched for not playing flex like Funps
[2022-12-29 22:57:29] <DemiCameron> @flynnT_lasermaki It's because they're locked at 60fps
