It's called an alliance. Perhaps you should make some as it seems you are struggling. Most newer players try to ally larger nations around them.

[2023-01-05 17:48:53] <towarzysz0> is it worth declaring a war, devving without the penalty and doing the real independence war later?

[2023-01-05 17:49:04] <%+DarkFV> !montferrat
