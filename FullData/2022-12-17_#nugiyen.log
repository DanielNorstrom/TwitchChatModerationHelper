[2022-12-17 13:17:36] <+stromgol23> should they make mid tier versions of these that you upgrade later on?

[2022-12-17 14:24:07] <+yardsale_eight> Anyone know the advantage of getting higher job level heist contracts (per the new small nodes)?
[2022-12-17 14:24:30] <%Vosy1984> better reward rooms
[2022-12-17 14:24:44] <%MrBonkeyDollax> I believe higher jpb level gets you more markers
[2022-12-17 14:24:46] VIEWERS: 585
[2022-12-17 14:25:47] <%Vosy1984> for example, if you do a contract that it is ilvl 70, you will probably have 3 rooms with 1 box each, ilvl 83+ will still have 3 rooms, but the relic will be more expensive and the rooms will have 2 boxes each
[2022-12-17 14:26:37] <wimpymeep> are you putting a nugi spin on the traditional doom build?
[2022-12-17 14:26:42] <%Vosy1984> dispair on hit is scaleable? with curse effect?

[2022-12-17 15:35:19] <@%+DerangedM8> poison is a form of chaos dot @axlex2
[2022-12-17 15:35:36] <shadows_embrace_you> Poison deals chaos damage yes
[2022-12-17 15:35:51] <+SlightRedeye> the single target reaches around 7m with just 14 cdr and a cast speed wand, main issue with impending is the mana costs
[2022-12-17 15:36:05] <+SlightRedeye> i was full ci gear EB just to cast it in level 60

[2022-12-17 15:36:10] <+blackwingcrobat> Hello, im currently making a Impending doom chaos build. PoB says it gets supported by empower but i dont have the money to buy it. do you maybe have one and can try it?
[2022-12-17 15:36:12] <+SlightRedeye> poison
[2022-12-17 15:36:48] <Evil_Spudie> @blackwingcrobat it's a support gem
[2022-12-17 15:36:59] VIEWERS: 611
[2022-12-17 15:36:59] <Evil_Spudie> although
[2022-12-17 15:37:05] <Evil_Spudie> if pob says it does work, idk
[2022-12-17 15:37:27] <+SlightRedeye> raw damage impending doom is about the same up front damage, but impending hits twice per cast
[2022-12-17 15:37:32] <+SlightRedeye> and casts every 0.3s
[2022-12-17 15:37:46] <+blackwingcrobat> @Evil_Spudie thats why im confused. the problem is that empower is to expensive to buy it just for testing
[2022-12-17 15:38:22] <Evil_Spudie> @blackwingcrobat haven't got one on std somewhere?
[2022-12-17 15:38:31] <+blackwingcrobat> ahh true i gotta check
[2022-12-17 15:38:50] <+yardsale_eight> Spell cascade
[2022-12-17 15:39:00] VIEWERS: 603
[2022-12-17 15:39:16] <+SlightRedeye> with spell cascade on vixens + the curse you self cast you overlap 2 curse area on the mob you're targeting, removing 2 curses per cast
[2022-12-17 15:39:21] <wimpymeep> yeah there's a cooldown on doom
[2022-12-17 15:39:29] <+SlightRedeye> and yeah ive never had a triple hit, doubles as good as it gets
[2022-12-17 15:39:45] <+yardsale_eight> doesn't lower charges
[2022-12-17 15:39:52] <+SlightRedeye> with the appropriate cast time you gain 2 charges between every cast
[2022-12-17 15:40:02] <+SlightRedeye> so it's 2 charges consumed per cast
[2022-12-17 15:40:21] <+yardsale_eight> Woke spell cascade makes it hit 3X
[2022-12-17 15:40:36] <+SlightRedeye> yeah you cap out on cast speed after a tiny investment
[2022-12-17 15:40:47] <+yardsale_eight> The charges seem bugged
[2022-12-17 15:40:52] <+SlightRedeye> woke cascade is just aoe it's never improving single target outside nicer positioning
[2022-12-17 15:40:52] <+blackwingcrobat> @Evil_Spudie yes empower supports impending doom support

[2022-12-17 15:41:49] <+SlightRedeye> impending doom is mega weird, you cant use +1 gem wands but you can use a +1 gem amulet

[2022-12-17 16:32:38] <@%Andrew756> i wonder if you could get 100 people save up untainteds or something
[2022-12-17 16:32:40] <Ruuno> speedrun would be 10min

[2022-12-17 16:35:03] <wimpymeep> @Szili96 probably the only attempt because they can't buy that many lakes again

[2022-12-17 16:58:44] <+VolatilePulse> Soulrend applies a dot, it doesn't matter how long an enemy is being "touched".

[2022-12-17 17:30:31] <zeholydodo> for enfeeble, it should, the wording implies it's on the damage dealing side (before defense calc)

[2022-12-17 17:40:08] <%Tjingkek> yeah, as long as you arent a facetank man
[2022-12-17 17:40:20] <!%Banaan_> dont go melee LUL
[2022-12-17 17:40:27] <+josneig> @mattgil84 you can increase strictness and customize what you want so still see
[2022-12-17 17:40:41] <VinnyPicone> you gotta use semi strict then and edit out the crap items. Or use a strict filter and put the low currency you want to see back in.
[2022-12-17 17:40:53] <BlockTrapKing> Cool deal. I played for a few seasons and just got burnt out. Could not get with it. I think mainly cause people said loot was complete shit.
[2022-12-17 17:41:02] <+mattgil84> k
[2022-12-17 17:41:08] <+eatsdolphins> that was oof
[2022-12-17 17:41:11] <Szili96> what happened?
[2022-12-17 17:41:11] <+nat33> they did LUL
[2022-12-17 17:41:15] <!%Banaan_> so funny LUL
[2022-12-17 17:41:19] <+eatsdolphins> like ouchie oof
[2022-12-17 17:41:24] <+janpaqt> just take neversink filter and choose strictness. then go edit to have the items you want
[2022-12-17 17:41:32] <Dragonkiller1983> wait wat
[2022-12-17 17:41:34] <+josneig> @BlockTrapKing its not, its in a good spot now

[2022-12-17 17:41:41] <%Tjingkek> :D
[2022-12-17 17:41:51] <Eternal0ve> I'll tell ya what, that step is my biggest fear when moving to strict
[2022-12-17 17:41:56] <+BeHereNow0> I like strict filtering but pressing Alt a lot, but maybe I'm crazy haha
[2022-12-17 17:41:59] <visor____> but only on uber strict I think
[2022-12-17 17:42:13] <BlockTrapKing> @josneig Cool deal! Thanks for responding!
[2022-12-17 17:42:18] <wubbles20x6> it's just a flask I have tons of flasks
[2022-12-17 17:42:36] <+NeonPython> To be fair if no unique dropped from the boss you'd question it right? And check loot?
[2022-12-17 17:42:46] <kruderf> amethyst flask was affected too I believe
[2022-12-17 17:42:53] <+saltpastillen> @BlockTrapKing Dont try Ruthless if you worry about loot LUL
[2022-12-17 17:42:54] <visor____> @NeonPython uber strict hides a lot of uniques
[2022-12-17 17:43:05] <@%Andrew756> i think so yes
[2022-12-17 17:43:10] <@%Andrew756> at least a mask lol

[2022-12-17 17:43:58] <@%+DerangedM8> so i'm good nugiEZ
[2022-12-17 17:44:11] <+NeonPython> @visor____ Does it hide any of his specific uniques?
[2022-12-17 17:44:16] <@%Andrew756> im sure it affected  only 0.00001% of the playerbase
[2022-12-17 17:44:26] <@%Andrew756> literally that one guy from that gfl vid
[2022-12-17 17:44:51] <+saltpastillen> We will never know though right :)

[2022-12-17 17:46:18] <tuftyfella> must there though?
[2022-12-17 17:46:35] <+MrPogsin> They really should reduce mana cost on soulrend KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:46:50] <+EidolonHC> use eb?
[2022-12-17 17:47:03] <!%warfirev> automate a nice big mana potion, and call it a day

[2022-12-17 17:53:18] <doctor_soggy_bottom> impending doom you say?
[2022-12-17 17:53:19] <iRorc> Maybe he did, but I only saw him talking about how he's destroying Ubers with it lol
[2022-12-17 17:53:39] VIEWERS: 970
[2022-12-17 17:53:43] <iRorc> I'm currently investigating the idea though :D
[2022-12-17 17:54:01] <Colorstrike> and skill
[2022-12-17 17:54:03] <doctor_soggy_bottom> i was wondering how impending doom with ignite elementalist would feel, with one of them essence staffs
[2022-12-17 17:54:10] <+eatsdolphins> i had a pob of a poison srs from alst league, think from a youtybe vid. Looked v strong
[2022-12-17 17:54:15] <doctor_soggy_bottom> and the hexbloom
[2022-12-17 17:54:25] <+nat33> Poision SRS was a thing before this league they are really strong tho not many play this version
[2022-12-17 17:54:31] <Colorstrike> I meant player skill
[2022-12-17 17:54:43] <+ffflippp> we know colorstrike :P
[2022-12-17 17:55:13] <+fridim94> should be like this in an arpg?
[2022-12-17 17:55:15] <Colorstrike> ah I misunderstood then
