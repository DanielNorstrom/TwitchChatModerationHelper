[2022-12-25 14:32:16] <sunnywyy> @pugib firstly, dont do transport missions, instead make buy orders in any rest cities in black zone, find ava roads and transport them back to royal cities
[2022-12-25 14:32:42] <pugib> hm ok thx
[2022-12-25 14:32:43] <mvp1803> Your healer resistance ou energy?
[2022-12-25 14:32:55] <sunnywyy> that was my suggestion, secondly you need to buy specific amount of hearts from the market depending on the size of the transport quest
[2022-12-25 14:33:30] <sunnywyy> thirdly you have to go to the faction warfare npc, go to the faction transport tab and claim mission, given that you have the mount weight

[2022-12-25 15:23:02] <sunnywyy> @RedMaxKing current bracilien is the same with all bz safe zones, the things that people use in pvp (especially solo or duo since its mists) gets sold the most
