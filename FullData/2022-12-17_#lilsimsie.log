[2022-12-17 00:53:01] <LindenSystem> having the "company" of watching streams helps a lot when I'm not well enough to do much, which makes me wonder how many stream viewers are ill - who else here is chronically or currently ill?

[2022-12-17 00:53:30] <pouronefortheporos> Cheer100  Hi Kayla, would you consider doing a build challenge where you spin a wheel to decide how much of one item you can use? So the wheel picks how many windows, doors, beds, counters, etc that you're allowed. (Sorry if this isn't the place for challenge ideas)

[2022-12-17 01:05:43] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2022-12-17 01:05:44] <TheyAreEli> Makes sense, thanks for the answer
