[2022-12-28 13:47:18] <+bdub2890> he will leave on loan
[2022-12-28 13:47:21] <+teasyy_tom> felix aint all that imo
[2022-12-28 13:47:24] <@%+Owen_Slater> Atleti not being in UCL KOs means they need funs

[2022-12-28 13:47:29] <%theJFKexperience0> Felix is best down the middle
[2022-12-28 13:47:31] <alfreddavidssonn> Surely both is too much with all other offensive power
[2022-12-28 13:47:31] <%+rjaywillz92> atm it seems were more focused on mudyak but athletico said 8m loan id take that
[2022-12-28 13:47:33] <+smokeymcpot_99> How old is he still young isn‚Äôt he

[2022-12-28 13:47:41] <%+Rhysmead1> Felix at 18 million loan fee is ridiculous wouldn‚Äôt be paying that much for someone for 6 months
[2022-12-28 13:47:45] <%+CfcDre02> Felix likes playing off the Left, LF like
[2022-12-28 13:47:46] <%theJFKexperience0> I think at most atleti get 50-70m
[2022-12-28 13:47:50] <+ZoobackHD> Chelsea, Arsenal, Utd could all use him
[2022-12-28 13:47:51] <+Remizzle> welcome to ac milan Felix
[2022-12-28 13:47:58] <Araxxos> United in for him aswell.. Missing out on Gakpo they'll be desperate to get him
[2022-12-28 13:48:00] <stennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> atleticos playing style doesn't fit him
[2022-12-28 13:48:07] <+ruftkut04> still cant believe man u bought anthony for 100m

[2022-12-28 13:48:13] <+leamybeamy1> Anywhere in the region of 60/70 million I think would do the job
[2022-12-28 13:48:14] <%chrisdepot> Who would you start on top Felix, Jesus, or Eddie?
[2022-12-28 13:48:17] <%tg_claptrap_tony> what do you think is a decent loan fee nep for 6 months or 18

[2022-12-28 14:30:05] <+rokerjoker_> I snipe a certain club from the Eredivisie. Late at night the cards pop at around 500 coins each so I can do that section if lucky for around 6k
[2022-12-28 14:30:07] <schefeyyy> Nepo I got about 500K liquid and am saving packs for toty... do you think that spending the 50K or whatever to complete these sbc's is a worth while investment?
[2022-12-28 14:30:10] <%+cooksteve88> afternoon nep, u opening any 85+ X10 or shall I just crack it
[2022-12-28 14:30:12] <jhunter123> Barkley and Ramsey are 4k ish
[2022-12-28 14:30:14] <%dangraham69> Cheaper to put in 83‚Äôs than commons it‚Äôs nuts
[2022-12-28 14:30:18] <JadsonXI> random question but do you prefer coffee or tea
[2022-12-28 14:30:20] <jamsekmiha> all of them about 4k
[2022-12-28 14:30:22] <padraigkav> I have a lot of joy with Stade Brestois for this section
[2022-12-28 14:30:22] <DiogoalsjotaRTG> I'm thinking of selling my whole club and making a new team should I do it
[2022-12-28 14:30:23] <jm1720> Watched ur league sbc video followed it and I had 70k did bpm then the league sbc then managed to pull a cheeky gravenberch
[2022-12-28 14:30:29] <johnthegg> funny how an 83 rated card is the best to use LUL

[2022-12-28 14:30:59] <%blazer33x> yes
[2022-12-28 14:31:02] <schefeyyy> Is it smarter to use like the more well known teams or like the most random ones possible from each league?
[2022-12-28 14:31:07] <+rokerjoker_> Becasue its only a 68 rated I stay away from French league where the common golds are 3-4k
[2022-12-28 14:31:14] <jhunter123> Sometimes you have to bite the bullet on two players I‚Äôve found
[2022-12-28 14:31:21] <JadsonXI> sold Lemina for 4k Nice

[2022-12-28 14:32:23] <schefeyyy> random cards sell and others you think should sell just don't
[2022-12-28 14:32:23] <jhunter123> We could do with an upgrade that uses rares
[2022-12-28 14:32:24] <xdready> @scattell23 yes because u need both to complete the objekt 5/5

[2022-12-28 14:32:25] <+rokerjoker_> Rare golds dont sell even on bid
[2022-12-28 14:32:26] <+htsolna08> only worth it for the extra obj packs
[2022-12-28 14:32:29] <JadsonXI> EA must love the market people end up buying the promo packs
[2022-12-28 14:32:35] <+reece_1995> terrible value but need to do it 5x for objectives.

[2022-12-28 14:35:02] <$jose_1245> Theres a lot of sud cards in bronze packs
[2022-12-28 14:35:02] <linus_teo> yes but more often than not you don't get a sule or aubameyang
[2022-12-28 14:35:11] <%oxjacksonx> I got a free gold pack in a pack in that pack was wildcard tomori 500k in the bank
[2022-12-28 14:35:15] <+rokerjoker_> Two of my favourite packs are rare small gold players and small prime gold players but through these run throughs they have been dry for me

[2022-12-28 14:35:24] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> monaco psg and marseille have the most gold rares in 6 that are 83 or under

[2022-12-28 14:36:06] <zTorrez> so your just buying the players for the sbcs? ur not grinding the BPM?
[2022-12-28 14:36:11] <+mxzefx> I‚Äôm thinking of going for the ww pick instead of the 85x10, thoughts??
[2022-12-28 14:36:14] <+crisedaofficial> is it worth to open packs during "best of" or wait until toty?
[2022-12-28 14:36:19] <+rokerjoker_> The fact they are 1k means with EA's pack weight I am finding they drop less for me in bronze packs
[2022-12-28 14:36:24] <%+flnnlsh> I just realised how ridiculous this new Chiellini card is omg :D
[2022-12-28 14:36:41] <+mxzefx> @crisedaofficial U ain‚Äôt gonna pack a toty prolly and it‚Äôs still a while to come so might as well open packs.

[2022-12-28 14:37:17] <+brianmcgee99> @jl73ven you only need a few k because every pack is profitble
[2022-12-28 14:37:17] <johnthegg> the new chem system just sucks with sbcs
[2022-12-28 14:37:22] <+crisedaofficial> @mxzefx cheers man im sat on like 40 packs and had no idea what to do with tehm
[2022-12-28 14:37:31] <%+katakuri> @jl73ven with that much I'd be blowing 50-100k ngl
[2022-12-28 14:37:35] <johnthegg> that's why they've had to make chem lower or nonexistent in them

[2022-12-28 14:40:07] <JadsonXI> don't understand why the did the gold minimum on this
[2022-12-28 14:40:13] <%+katakuri> @jl73ven no worries. you'll stack the club with crappy bronzes & sell the pricey ones & then do the bronze upgrade/silv/ upgrades. the grind innit

[2022-12-28 14:43:27] <+rokerjoker_> I use the same Eredivisie club each time. At the right time of day I can do it for 6-7k from sratch
[2022-12-28 14:43:30] <%+robertovidal46> Heerenven can be tight on the rating
[2022-12-28 14:43:36] <johnthegg> i remember when utrecht players were like 25k in one fifa because of their league sbc squad
[2022-12-28 14:43:36] <%+howdyitsdavid> I did Ligue Un x4 and FC Utrecht once and that worked out pretty well
[2022-12-28 14:43:37] <lukebe10> FC Emmen aren't too bad if you want to try them

[2022-12-28 14:44:43] <johnthegg> @fcrobba i assume because they have so many rare golds?
[2022-12-28 14:44:47] <jake123playz> stade de renes is the best ive used

[2022-12-28 14:45:56] <+rokerjoker_> The problem with a club with 5-6 golds is that the silvers and bronzes are inflated

[2022-12-28 14:49:50] <+brianmcgee99> bpm does work, ive been doing it for 3 days. Its basically paid for 8 run throughs of the league sbcs
[2022-12-28 14:49:51] <linus_teo> unless you hit the lib/sud or ligue 1 cards nothing much sells from BPM personally
[2022-12-28 14:49:52] <FrancoJavierM> I'm doing what Nick is doing, filling half of the trade pile from BPM and then the other half from SPM.

[2022-12-28 15:58:20] <OriginallyTom> Just win a game, then give a game away. Stay in rivals and get rewards
[2022-12-28 15:58:22] <+ConRL> You had all the world cup swaps, 100s of games needed

[2022-12-28 15:58:53] <+ConRL> like 3 packs, usually crap ones at that
[2022-12-28 15:58:54] <eatburgers1> Now that league sbcs are out, the grind to get slightly higher rewards only once a week just for being a higher div is not worth it, so you might as well take the easy road for objectives
[2022-12-28 15:59:00] <+alphvgam3r> true, but taking those picks or the ptg picks from the other tokens, is not it.

[2022-12-28 17:10:14] <%$dan_smithhhx> there are three objectives for playoffs and three for finals
[2022-12-28 17:10:14] <vibekelangaasen> What do you think is the best way to do the ligue 1/eredviese segment?
[2022-12-28 17:10:15] <+LengthyBloke> It specifies between finals and playoffs in the description
[2022-12-28 17:10:16] <%$UJayne1997> one is for quali, the rest is for finals
[2022-12-28 17:10:16] <+dexterrrr_> they adjusted it
[2022-12-28 17:10:17] <%$DavisPlayzz> it only counts for the first 4 wins, after that its finals sadly
[2022-12-28 17:10:17] <salman_jawed98> @flexwheezy same bro. Stuck with a lot of fodder
[2022-12-28 17:10:18] <dryasscookiess> half is for qualifiers, other half finals

[2022-12-28 17:10:19] <moehamza909> It says 16 wins in finals
[2022-12-28 17:10:30] <%$BobbyTambling> EA change it, it's ok
[2022-12-28 17:10:34] <+ZaneLuck> it counted yesterday
[2022-12-28 17:10:34] <flexwheezy> @salman_jawed98 yea,and duplicates discarding sucks
[2022-12-28 17:10:35] <Skrays99> did he show the 16 wins one?
[2022-12-28 17:10:37] <gotheim2006> what do you think about saving packs for TOTY?
[2022-12-28 17:10:39] <+T___Train> they counted for me
[2022-12-28 17:10:39] <Skrays99> its always been finals
[2022-12-28 17:10:42] <%$Amit_Alon> the win 4 is qualis

[2022-12-28 17:10:53] <jhunter123> I think it‚Äôs worded differently on the objectives
[2022-12-28 17:10:57] <swecrocks> They changed then. Typical EA
[2022-12-28 17:11:01] <leeclark3> It depends what objective it was, some only count in finals others don‚Äôt
[2022-12-28 17:11:07] <Skrays99> chat is confused
[2022-12-28 17:11:07] <flexwheezy> @salman_jawed98 for sure, would be great man <3
[2022-12-28 17:11:11] <manpkhumza> no
[2022-12-28 17:11:17] <+T___Train> They changed it, it worked for me
[2022-12-28 17:11:19] <%$dan_smithhhx> They definitely changed it, said FUT champions matches
[2022-12-28 17:11:20] <+pmcewan> The first 2 are for qualifiers, 3 for the finals and 1 covers both.
[2022-12-28 17:11:21] <grantmc23> the play 5 one is fut champs matches

[2022-12-28 17:12:20] <%$Amit_Alon> youll get given like 8
[2022-12-28 17:12:22] <@%+Owen_Slater> Bad players dont deserve the bonus rewards, as harsh as that sounds
[2022-12-28 17:12:24] <%$dan_smithhhx> That Nice RB from Switzerland goes for 4k just sold him fyi
[2022-12-28 17:12:25] <+jacktwoodard00> It's 8 wins a week

[2022-12-28 17:12:31] <vibekelangaasen> @BobbyTambling its 13 and 3
[2022-12-28 17:12:38] <signingpoem9620> No it‚Äôs 12 from 40 as you can get the first 4 in qualy
[2022-12-28 17:12:40] <arsenaljay> Have EA cancelled the icons SBCs that was due this week?
[2022-12-28 17:12:40] <+M4N5F1ELD_> @owen_slater facts
[2022-12-28 17:12:42] <eatburgers1> I'm a bad player, I reckon I can count on 7 wins in champs and 4 or 5 from quals, so I can easily do it with two weeks
[2022-12-28 17:12:42] <swecrocks> And still. Why should it be avalible to get the better rewards for everyone..
[2022-12-28 17:12:43] <yo_pieerree> Doesn‚Äôt it expiry before next week champs
[2022-12-28 17:12:50] <%$BobbyTambling> @BobbyTambling OMG what's wrong with my calculations, sorry that's on me ahahah
[2022-12-28 17:12:52] <georgios1998> hey Nep did u want to open my packs for toty will have 100 for shareplay content

[2022-12-28 17:12:55] <%+Downtroddenz> we're gonna have more noobs than usual in WL anyway so it should be relatively easy
[2022-12-28 17:12:57] <+itzjc24> @owen_slater agreed, that‚Äôs the whole point of an extra reward, it rewards skilled players
[2022-12-28 17:12:59] <+T___Train> Tomori incoming
[2022-12-28 17:13:01] <%+kingnovakin> @eatburgers1 qualis dont count

[2022-12-28 17:13:06] <mgromley616> Winter league upgrades seem like a huge waste of time and energy
[2022-12-28 17:13:08] <+fgo___> not ever feel rewards are rigged against the better players?
[2022-12-28 17:13:08] <@%+Owen_Slater> People obsess with having to complete it all, if EA released a WL plus just for this weekend, and had a 20 win reward for a prime icon pack, people would moan that 20 is impossible, its not meant to be easy
[2022-12-28 17:13:12] <arsenaljay> Chat or Nep, have EA cancelled the Jairzinho sbc?
[2022-12-28 17:13:17] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> I just had a guy griddy on me giving him a free win in draft lmao, equalised and quit just like you did
[2022-12-28 17:13:19] <deziixixv> Sbmm
[2022-12-28 17:13:21] <eatburgers1> So with that being said, you would have to be seriously bad not to be able to do it, because I am pretty bad and still qualify

[2022-12-28 17:38:30] <jhunter123> @chemicallocust ultimately depends who you have in your club I reccomend using a club you have 5 or 6 players in with two rares
[2022-12-28 17:38:34] <%m3elv1n> do you just need 5 players in the right pos to get 15chem?

[2022-12-28 18:04:56] <%+clutchball> keeper moving is one of the worst things on fifa not even slightly realistic either

[2022-12-28 18:05:15] <+Jeeves14> The only thing with moving the keeper is, sometimes its the only way to save against broken trivela shots
[2022-12-28 18:05:17] <jhunter123> You can move the keeper the wrong way and make it easy for your opponent though
[2022-12-28 18:05:19] <%KC_Runz> Takes zero skill as well, just a broken movement
[2022-12-28 18:05:24] <modelitos> Last line of D. You gotta have composure to finish.
[2022-12-28 18:05:25] <dizzydukc> its just not real

[2022-12-28 18:06:12] <jhunter123> Personally I think there is a skill to keeper movement

[2022-12-28 18:07:03] <here4rewards_> Stingray a pro player has insane GK movement, he moves his keeper nearly into the goal so they have more time to react to shots
[2022-12-28 18:07:09] <+greenzilla33> move him wrong way though and easy goal for opponent
[2022-12-28 18:07:12] <CyrixEu> If u even remotely move the keepper in the shot direction its a save
[2022-12-28 18:07:14] <+akimb0o4> Keeper movement adds to the mind games which I like
[2022-12-28 18:07:14] <%+Lucky9631> anticipation does come into it though... slight skill gap in reading where a player is going to place a shot
[2022-12-28 18:07:16] <jhunter123> @itstr3ple this is the point I agree with
[2022-12-28 18:07:16] <+timmynlane> it would be ok if the attacker didn't always hit it at the keeper regardless of where you aim
[2022-12-28 18:07:26] <+widgey29> If you move your keeper you should have to time the dive
[2022-12-28 18:07:30] <jhunter123> I agree with lucky
[2022-12-28 18:07:30] <+Romanlamagna> The passing in this game drives me insane

[2022-12-28 18:07:37] <gabagool_eatah> keeper movement is a double edged sword
[2022-12-28 18:07:39] <+bbuckelew415> Ai defense is more annoying than keeper movement

[2022-12-28 18:08:02] <futsharky> whats ur opinion on finesse shots? in my opinion finesse outside box doesn't show skill at all. it proves that u cant get into the players boxes.. straight after corners is understandable.
