[2022-12-15 17:18:37] <Zahhhak> honestly speaking this game won't be fixed until riot would change its policy, people are getting chat blocked in the game and get chat ban restriction for like 3 days or even a 14 days to permaban, ok that fixes toxicity in game (from Riot pov) and wtf about people going 0/10 isn't that inting?

[2022-12-15 17:27:12] <+Briguydahood> not only a dumb system, but lets add more and space them so close that you mis-ping the opposite direction so easily. Lets cause more toxicity in our game while pretending to care about the game enviorment
[2022-12-15 17:27:18] <+tazmaniandevl69> I seriously doubt people will be as toxic in game with voice chat vs in game chat
[2022-12-15 17:27:19] <+mankilla10> it's not that hard ppl
[2022-12-15 17:27:21] <+onyx_pupper> honestly died a lot of times and wastes time trying to type everything
[2022-12-15 17:27:23] <$SavageDrumming> Im all for VC, I'm merely saying it's gonna be a rough place for those who leave it on lol
[2022-12-15 17:27:29] <%+malkraven> people need to get over hurt feelings
[2022-12-15 17:27:30] <Zahhhak> I mean voice chat won't help communicating effectively that's what I meant
[2022-12-15 17:27:36] <+Squatchyyyyy> but mike its so much easier to flame and be toxic without people hearing my nasally voice
[2022-12-15 17:27:39] <blasterblaidd> csgo and valorant got toxic ppl in voice coms, but you can just mute them if all they do is distrub the communication

[2022-12-15 17:35:51] <Zahhhak> as jungler main, you have either the highest chance of winning game or being the most useless player in the game depending on your teammates, if you have teammates that can bait for ganks or at least rotate for objectives then yeah you can do something, but if they constantly lose lane and never help with anything then the only thing you can do is afk because they will invade you over and over, so you can't even farm
