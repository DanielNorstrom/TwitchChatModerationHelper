[2022-12-28 14:28:42] <Blesk420TP> Pro tip for ladies, you ain't gonna find a "good man" in parties and such, because those sit at home or friend's place because they value the peace
[2022-12-28 14:28:45] <%Avari_Arts> idk i don't speak for all women but i was done with that shit in my early 20s

[2022-12-28 14:33:55] <Blesk420TP> the issue for men is that no matter what he will be blamed for the relationship going south. She cheated - guy was a poor bf.
