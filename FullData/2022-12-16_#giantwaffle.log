[2022-12-16 20:13:18] <+stormblaz> @tech Curseforge was good, noe lle that Twitch app...well lets leave that behind shall we, not a portfolio center showpiece
[2022-12-16 20:13:35] <MagicBallZA> Glad to see a solo gamer playing! Too many staQed teams min/max'd
[2022-12-16 20:13:43] <+stormblaz> but it was still pretty decent imo
[2022-12-16 20:13:45] <%+keeneye204> are portals timed? or maybe one time use?
[2022-12-16 20:13:47] <%imTymp> yes
[2022-12-16 20:13:49] [Notification] mrcaseyg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months!
[2022-12-16 20:14:03] <+stormblaz> you can also break barrels
[2022-12-16 20:14:20] <Inshya> You can get on things (like on a crate or a chest) and the mobs that are little cannot hit you CatBag
[2022-12-16 20:14:28] <%imTymp> portals are one time use and they can spawn as 1 portal or a group of 3 portals in a triangle
[2022-12-16 20:14:32] <%+saini311088> feel it really needs a solo mode
[2022-12-16 20:14:57] <%+Vizion_TV> Sadge apparently the fighter is the weakest class
[2022-12-16 20:15:14] <+stormblaz> Game def has a strong and harsh learning curve no?
[2022-12-16 20:15:15] <Inshya> Man try to play solo wizard
[2022-12-16 20:15:19] <%+Vizion_TV> Cleric and wizard are listed in S tier
[2022-12-16 20:15:23] <WalrusPug> Rangers are wet noodles
[2022-12-16 20:15:24] <Inshya> What
[2022-12-16 20:15:24] <+stormblaz> tutorial just nonexistant
[2022-12-16 20:15:26] <%+ScarceLoot> yea but it has a heal
[2022-12-16 20:15:42] <+tenaciousexplosivo> the game looks a lot easier than it was before
[2022-12-16 20:15:44] <+stormblaz> invisible position is goat
[2022-12-16 20:16:03] <%imTymp> fighters can use a bow secondary too i think
[2022-12-16 20:16:09] <%imTymp> one of the bow types
[2022-12-16 20:16:20] <grahm3> yep? they do
[2022-12-16 20:16:20] <Inshya> You can see traps on the map I think
[2022-12-16 20:16:26] <+RepoManOG> There’s a mini tutorial click on the FopDoodle book in the main lobby
[2022-12-16 20:16:28] <DaemonSzyman> I think it says on the bandage
[2022-12-16 20:16:30] <DaemonSzyman> like 20%
[2022-12-16 20:16:30] <+stormblaz> the sound effects are reallly good not going to lie
[2022-12-16 20:16:33] <The_Holas> *spider tingle*
[2022-12-16 20:16:35] <DaemonSzyman> Read the bandage
[2022-12-16 20:16:38] <panwaffle> So some other player can find him, kill him and take his loot at anytime?
[2022-12-16 20:16:39] <%ThirstQuencher> 74hp to ...
[2022-12-16 20:16:43] <%ThirstQuencher> 84

[2022-12-16 20:20:09] <+stormblaz> gredge
[2022-12-16 20:20:15] <%$Mandorake> @Giantwaffle if you have Weapon Mastery you can use bows and other classes items
[2022-12-16 20:20:17] <%+Reaver_in_Black> maybe only pick up magic stuff no Grace
[2022-12-16 20:20:21] <%+Reaver_in_Black> gray
[2022-12-16 20:20:26] <%Rool_Gonzalez> Bow is good,you safe at distance and do damage
[2022-12-16 20:20:27] <+stormblaz> they make loosing fun
[2022-12-16 20:20:31] <The_Holas> and you are playing solo
[2022-12-16 20:20:33] <FinnYellowbelly> greedge
[2022-12-16 20:20:35] <+stormblaz> cuz its fast to get bacj in
[2022-12-16 20:20:36] <DaemonSzyman> That means you can use a bow
[2022-12-16 20:20:40] <%$Mandorake> That lets you use bows
[2022-12-16 20:20:41] <%imTymp> u should force 2 people to play with u if u play offstream its real fun to play in groups of 3 with friends we had so many funny encounters last playtest
[2022-12-16 20:20:42] <+tenaciousexplosivo> try playing with others? Where's shorty?
[2022-12-16 20:20:54] <grahm3> You definitely want some sort of ranged weapon
[2022-12-16 20:20:55] <%$Mandorake> yes you do
[2022-12-16 20:20:58] <DaemonSzyman> Range sounds like a good option
[2022-12-16 20:21:00] <The_Holas> you are doing good for solo and new player
[2022-12-16 20:21:00] <rukiri> plate didn't do much for that dude, died in like 4 hits?
[2022-12-16 20:21:03] <%Rool_Gonzalez> poor guys have to strip you and Maybe,just maybe get Dumped by next group KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:21:03] <%$Mandorake> bows are really great for picking off mobs like the flyers
[2022-12-16 20:21:13] <DaemonSzyman> Range to weaken then sword to finish

[2022-12-16 20:21:28] <%$Mandorake> yes you have infinite arrows
[2022-12-16 20:21:32] <%Dagmoo> you can swap the talents right? just give bow a shot

[2022-12-16 20:43:52] <grahm3> the dagger's range is so small, you've gotta crouch to consistently attack spiders

[2022-12-16 20:51:39] <@%ninopanda> @Movinggun1 oh shit I didnt know that!! That is awesome. in Security you hit both worlds
[2022-12-16 20:51:44] <%+ScarceLoot> might not be able to break everything with a dagger
[2022-12-16 20:51:56] <+stormblaz> most break but idk if by weapon type
[2022-12-16 20:52:06] <grahm3> dagger and rapiers can't breake half of the barrels and boxes
[2022-12-16 20:52:24] <+Hurpud> u can dual wield on fighter
[2022-12-16 20:52:26] <The_Holas> i think you can
[2022-12-16 20:52:28] <Eranok2207> you can
[2022-12-16 20:52:33] <Eranok2207> put 2nd on shield slot
[2022-12-16 20:52:34] <%+Vizion_TV> have you tried on your main hand
[2022-12-16 20:52:39] <+Soul12eaver> this would be so good as a VR game
[2022-12-16 20:52:44] <Timer_lol> there's a dagger that's an offhand think it's called castellon
[2022-12-16 20:52:50] <%+Vizion_TV> The shield slot Wafle
[2022-12-16 20:52:52] <+kenshin2666> if you can sword and shield, you should be able to dual daggers
[2022-12-16 20:52:58] <grahm3> you can dual wield daggers it changes the attack animation, but you need a different dagger to take it in offhand
[2022-12-16 20:53:07] <+Hurpud> ur doing it wrong
[2022-12-16 20:53:10] <Inshya> you need an "off hand"
[2022-12-16 20:53:15] <Inshya> no?
[2022-12-16 20:53:21] <Eranok2207> 2nd dagger on SHIELD slot

[2022-12-16 20:58:04] <The_Holas> what about that stealth may be better
[2022-12-16 20:58:10] <DaemonSzyman> oh
[2022-12-16 20:58:12] <Holland_NL> any plans to team up with people? @giantwaffle
[2022-12-16 20:58:13] <+dunpealhunter87> is there enough space to run behind someone?
[2022-12-16 20:58:17] <%Dagmoo> @movinggun1 yeah welcome back widepeepoHappy
[2022-12-16 20:58:52] <+dunpealhunter87> how much is this game?
[2022-12-16 20:58:53] <Eranok2207> DUAl WIelD -> put second dagger in shield slot
[2022-12-16 20:58:57] <The_Holas> i think stealth may be beter could save you now
[2022-12-16 20:59:04] <%Charlie_The_Snowman> 2 more
[2022-12-16 20:59:10] <Holland_NL> @dunpealhunter87 it's in an open playtest at the moment
[2022-12-16 20:59:12] <%+rykk3r1> just one more turn :)
[2022-12-16 20:59:17] <+kenshin2666> double the daggers, double the damage
[2022-12-16 20:59:21] <Eranok2207> dual wield adds a bit of damage, not much
[2022-12-16 20:59:22] <WalrusPug> "just one more run" ;)
[2022-12-16 20:59:23] <+dunpealhunter87> uhuh the "one more run" loop
[2022-12-16 20:59:24] <Eranok2207> different moveset
[2022-12-16 20:59:31] <Eranok2207> dualwield is very technical, check guide
[2022-12-16 20:59:36] <BurnedAether> Tape two daggers together for double the reach.
[2022-12-16 20:59:40] <Holland_NL> dual wield is mainly good for stacking the buffs on the weapons
[2022-12-16 20:59:41] <The_Holas> one more run sounds like another turn in Civ SUSSY
[2022-12-16 20:59:43] <%Charlie_The_Snowman> 1 more "perfect" run
[2022-12-16 21:00:07] <%+rykk3r1> @BurnedAether holy shit are you a genius
[2022-12-16 21:00:09] <+kenshin2666> @BurnedAether tape 4 daggers, each 2 hilt to hilt, and quad wield
[2022-12-16 21:00:16] <Holland_NL> did he take the Conscious choice to play a team game as a solo?
[2022-12-16 21:00:22] <%TheWonderLlama> High ground NODDERS

[2022-12-16 21:01:31] <Holland_NL> that was not a typo
[2022-12-16 21:01:49] <Holland_NL> it's a team game after all

[2022-12-16 21:02:23] <%$Mandorake> @Giantwaffle I found fighter easier than rogue.  So much stronger against mobs
[2022-12-16 21:02:27] <+sub5runner> game really said 1 more run
[2022-12-16 21:02:30] <DaemonSzyman> Until wizard casts fireball and kills everyone in the room KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:02:37] <%$Mandorake> and you can heal
[2022-12-16 21:02:39] <Eranok2207> its possible, but solo players are nerfing themselves HARD
[2022-12-16 21:02:46] <Eranok2207> try barbarian if you want damage
[2022-12-16 21:02:46] <+NickTheMailMan> take someone out close a door behind you, turn the lights off, invis, gank op
[2022-12-16 21:02:55] <%Charlie_The_Snowman> @DaemonSzyman haha

[2022-12-16 21:04:21] <UndeadLeech> Dijkstra is pretty quick to understand, probably a good one to learn.
[2022-12-16 21:04:24] <&%+Tech> Could learn and then potions

[2022-12-16 21:23:01] <jayrickson87> that's the only way
[2022-12-16 21:23:04] <adrian_aoe> what's Tarkov Street?
[2022-12-16 21:23:04] <The_Holas> Did you say Ci is playing with you isnt that like civil war Kappa
[2022-12-16 21:23:05] <razborsek> If you know what your doing you can easily beat this pack in around 300H
[2022-12-16 21:23:05] <+dunpealhunter87> i cant be done
[2022-12-16 21:23:10] <%September2030> im not sleeping thats for damn sure
[2022-12-16 21:23:10] <&%+Tech> Pati has been playing this so much
[2022-12-16 21:23:11] <%+BlackKnight17> No Christmas for anyone, then. NODDERS
[2022-12-16 21:23:11] <&%+Tech> He loves it
[2022-12-16 21:23:15] <jay7t_> 1 month for Infinity gear, that would be nuts KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:23:17] <adamh29> You do t play games long enough to finish them lol lol
[2022-12-16 21:23:19] <%Allmostdone> Well I had to try
[2022-12-16 21:23:26] <+dunpealhunter87> reydKEKW
[2022-12-16 21:23:29] <jay7t_> not even 1 month, like 2 weeks KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:23:31] <jayrickson87> no hiding stuff from each other and be on the same page
[2022-12-16 21:23:35] <DaemonSzyman> LUL
[2022-12-16 21:23:36] <jayrickson87> it can
[2022-12-16 21:23:37] <pt0ughneigh> fake news
[2022-12-16 21:23:41] <%GFQPR1882> KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:23:49] <%+DragonApoc> He gives up in 3 days
[2022-12-16 21:23:49] <&%+Tech> I doubt Waffle
[2022-12-16 21:23:49] <bandani> 'doesnt play long enough' - tera flashbacks
[2022-12-16 21:23:52] <&%+Tech> But I don't doubt Pati
[2022-12-16 21:23:54] <&%+Tech> Pati will crush this
[2022-12-16 21:23:56] <jayrickson87> he does when he wants
[2022-12-16 21:23:59] <%Tenkaichi500> X to Doubt
[2022-12-16 21:24:05] <%Allmostdone> no we watched to hold time on Youtube
[2022-12-16 21:24:07] <%GFQPR1882> u got this :)
[2022-12-16 21:24:10] <+kenshin2666> X
[2022-12-16 21:24:10] <%+DemonicHell3> Chat vs waffle crew on who can beat it first KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:24:11] <+dunpealhunter87> *cough* factorio *cough*
[2022-12-16 21:24:12] <jayrickson87> I believe
[2022-12-16 21:24:19] <DaemonSzyman> I dont doubt this will be fun either way :)
[2022-12-16 21:24:35] <%Helo_KiX> what is the modpack?
[2022-12-16 21:24:36] <@+Movinggun1> Looks like my minecraft account is RIP I forgot my recovery questions
[2022-12-16 21:24:38] <DaemonSzyman> Waffle will be base bitch, Pati will be chief engineer NODDERS
[2022-12-16 21:24:48] <%GFQPR1882> what ever happens its gonna be fun so
[2022-12-16 21:24:54] <&%+Tech> Good luck Movinggun1
[2022-12-16 21:24:58] <%GFQPR1882> SeemsGood
[2022-12-16 21:25:08] <&%+Tech> you'll need to know those, or you need to know the payment info for what you bought the account with
[2022-12-16 21:25:21] <&%+Tech> A lot of them
[2022-12-16 21:25:36] <&%+Tech> Most of the minecon capes are in that state
[2022-12-16 21:25:39] <@+Movinggun1> I mean it says if I have the same email from the account it will let me reset them, it tells me it sent me an email but it didn't so the mojang SMTP server might be ded
[2022-12-16 21:25:40] <pt0ughneigh> was that the first one?
[2022-12-16 21:25:40] <+dunpealhunter87> is art of the rail actually coming out? I heard the dev is sick or something
[2022-12-16 21:25:45] <SeriousPotatoBot> Isn't it the same with 2012 era Bitcoin wallets
[2022-12-16 21:25:48] <SeriousPotatoBot> as well
[2022-12-16 21:25:51] <&%+Tech> @Movinggun1 It is
[2022-12-16 21:25:56] <&%+Tech> It was killed on March 10th
[2022-12-16 21:26:06] <jay7t_> D: rip

[2022-12-16 21:26:23] <@%ninopanda> @Movinggun1 did you have a script to auto restart the MC server?
[2022-12-16 21:26:23] <%$Tabakhase> could learn some pathfinding-algos or regex if you want some code PauseChamp
[2022-12-16 21:26:37] <pt0ughneigh> ah
[2022-12-16 21:26:37] <@+Movinggun1> @ninopanda probably
[2022-12-16 21:26:43] <%GFQPR1882> What video did u want to watch ?
[2022-12-16 21:26:44] <pt0ughneigh> I think I saw that one lol

[2022-12-16 21:26:45] <%$Tabakhase> @ninopanda systemd unit ?
[2022-12-16 21:26:45] <@%ninopanda> ok i will hunt for it. lol
[2022-12-16 21:26:47] <%HammersCreation> is waffle still doing a server for nomifactory?
[2022-12-16 21:26:51] <%TheWonderLlama> That guy who bought two pizza and a soda for 10,000 Bitcoin
[2022-12-16 21:27:09] <%lalashkin_G> Isn't it like restart=always? @Tabakhase

[2022-12-16 21:27:38] <SeriousPotatoBot> widePepeLaugh My grandparents paid £5k for their band new house in the 60's
[2022-12-16 21:27:38] <%Allmostdone> they sieved them and then someone just moved the stuff to a differnet wallet
[2022-12-16 21:27:40] <+dunpealhunter87> i can just imagine some pizza baker being a multi-millionaire by now staarKEKS
[2022-12-16 21:27:40] <pt0ughneigh> mom dad paid like 5k for college full tuition

[2022-12-16 21:27:43] <HomelesPenguin> did you ever see the CSGO event? winners got like $500, 2nd place like $250 and 3rd place 5 bitcoin LUL
[2022-12-16 21:27:46] <pt0ughneigh> money is strange
[2022-12-16 21:27:46] <HomelesPenguin> something like that
[2022-12-16 21:27:46] <%+FrostedSentry> visualizations
[2022-12-16 21:27:49] <%$Tabakhase> @lalashkin_G ye thats why i´m askn LUL i fear a screen session or so :D
[2022-12-16 21:27:50] <&%+Tech> A* is a really easy one to learn
[2022-12-16 21:27:52] <%TheWonderLlama> It was one of the first commercial purchases with bitcoin, it was a big deal at the time NODDERS
[2022-12-16 21:28:04] <%GFQPR1882> Yh true £55k to about £600k house
[2022-12-16 21:28:10] <%+FrostedSentry> YES
[2022-12-16 21:28:12] <&%+Tech> Yeah
[2022-12-16 21:28:14] <UndeadLeech> Dijkstra and A* are basically exactly the same. A* is just a trivial optimization on top of Dijkstra.
[2022-12-16 21:28:14] <%+FrostedSentry> so interesting
[2022-12-16 21:28:15] <&%+Tech> A star is really easy
[2022-12-16 21:28:16] <%samitheberber> A* is basically practical solution of Djisktra
[2022-12-16 21:28:23] <%+gutter54> "math"
[2022-12-16 21:28:26] <%Allmostdone> were is these link?
[2022-12-16 21:28:33] <SeriousPotatoBot> susHmm Magic
[2022-12-16 21:28:40] <SubbDogg> yes
[2022-12-16 21:28:53] <UndeadLeech> Dijkstra doesn't take the distance to the goal into account at all, A* does.

[2022-12-16 21:28:55] <SubbDogg> dijkstra just gets length to all graph nodes
[2022-12-16 21:28:55] <TomatenPleb> i love how you call it dickstar
[2022-12-16 21:28:56] <%+FrostedSentry> cohhL so neat
[2022-12-16 21:29:00] <spotchious> looks greedy
[2022-12-16 21:29:10] <Merk7> maybe that's just the first way it looks?
[2022-12-16 21:29:10] <&%+Tech> This is the one I watched on A star
[2022-12-16 21:29:11] <&%+Tech> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE
[2022-12-16 21:29:12] <dr_Griff> greedy
[2022-12-16 21:29:12] <%GFQPR1882> LUL
[2022-12-16 21:29:14] <%+FrostedSentry> now we gotta watch a video!
[2022-12-16 21:29:17] <wulfnorek> becouse its best... duh
[2022-12-16 21:29:17] <Marenti> put a u turn in it and compare?
[2022-12-16 21:29:26] <dr_Griff> efficient unless it picks the wrong path
[2022-12-16 21:29:39] <%GFQPR1882> How would it know which way to go
[2022-12-16 21:29:41] <%GFQPR1882> ?
[2022-12-16 21:29:53] <%+ShaveAWookiee> A* is the best
[2022-12-16 21:29:54] <%+FrostedSentry> !!!!!
[2022-12-16 21:29:58] <spotchious> i thought A* was bidirectional?
[2022-12-16 21:30:00] <UndeadLeech> It's really not that difficult.
[2022-12-16 21:30:02] <%+FrostedSentry> cohhJam cohhBongos
[2022-12-16 21:30:07] <%GFQPR1882> or does it know where the red is
[2022-12-16 21:30:12] <%+ShaveAWookiee> it's really not that hard if you read and try to replicate
[2022-12-16 21:30:16] <CocoScruff> algorithm Kreygasm
[2022-12-16 21:30:17] <$7hat> Are these NPC walking path algos?
[2022-12-16 21:30:17] <&%+Tech> Watch this explanation nerd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE
[2022-12-16 21:30:23] <+WoofWoofDude> it's really simple tbh
[2022-12-16 21:30:25] <jay7t_> basic ai search algorithms monkaS I fucking hated those lectures
[2022-12-16 21:30:25] <%GFQPR1882> waffleHmm
[2022-12-16 21:30:29] <%$Tabakhase> yes this is pathfinding not searching @GFQPR1882
[2022-12-16 21:30:44] <$7hat> fish
[2022-12-16 21:30:45] <spotchious> @Giantwaffle A* is normally taught as bidirectional.  click that box yo
[2022-12-16 21:30:47] <%GFQPR1882> @tabakhase Oh I was gonna say KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:30:56] <%+FrostedSentry> cohhBongos
[2022-12-16 21:30:58] <Marenti> LUL nice jebait
[2022-12-16 21:31:05] <KnightofObv> What if it's not reachable?
[2022-12-16 21:31:08] <GoksiiLija> its slowed down btw ...
[2022-12-16 21:31:15] <%CRAZY__ENZO> basically djikstra with a heuristic
[2022-12-16 21:31:17] <jay7t_> KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:31:24] <DaemonSzyman> Uh oh it does not like IDA KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:31:25] <%GFQPR1882> @tabakhase waffleLove
[2022-12-16 21:31:35] <SeaOfMadness_> what about the fastest one?
[2022-12-16 21:31:40] <+Jerod5_> do bi-directional
[2022-12-16 21:31:40] <%+ScarceLoot> your turn
[2022-12-16 21:31:48] <sekul_0210> best first
[2022-12-16 21:31:54] <UndeadLeech> It always depends on your requirements.
[2022-12-16 21:31:55] <$jegkanikkelidetwitch> it times it in the bottom left?
[2022-12-16 21:31:57] <Stonan> Step 2: Draw the rest of the owl.
[2022-12-16 21:32:00] <+WoofWoofDude> A* simply compute the "distance" between a cell and the end and put it in a sorted list and just pick the next cell with the smallest distance
[2022-12-16 21:32:12] <%Miestro> change the heuristic on A*
[2022-12-16 21:32:15] <%$Tabakhase> for your fastest - there will be a maze to defeat it :P
[2022-12-16 21:32:26] <+dunpealhunter87> try euclidean
[2022-12-16 21:32:35] <Ganiwasthere> A* algorithm
[2022-12-16 21:32:35] <%Miestro> it's how it calculates what dircetions to search
[2022-12-16 21:32:36] <%+ShaveAWookiee> different distance type
[2022-12-16 21:32:41] <spotchious> bi directional should be much better
[2022-12-16 21:32:43] <imNoxel> distance score is just not manhatten, but euclidean score
[2022-12-16 21:33:04] <+stormblaz> oh boi
[2022-12-16 21:33:16] <%Miestro> path finding is cool
[2022-12-16 21:33:20] <Ganiwasthere> although there are a lot of algorithm
[2022-12-16 21:33:23] <%GFQPR1882> Reverse engineering nice
[2022-12-16 21:33:28] <%Miestro> also this map you have is a really good test
[2022-12-16 21:33:33] <%Miestro> try the jump point on this map
[2022-12-16 21:33:34] <%Allmostdone> well that's cheating you know wherer the finish is
[2022-12-16 21:33:35] <%+FrostedSentry> and now you can sense this being such an important part of game development AI agent > finding you
[2022-12-16 21:33:41] <%+FrostedSentry> super interesting
[2022-12-16 21:33:54] <%+FrostedSentry> how *well* do they find you?
[2022-12-16 21:33:56] <spotchious> bi directional A* would be better than BFS
[2022-12-16 21:33:57] <UndeadLeech> It doesn't provide the greatest solution though.
[2022-12-16 21:34:00] <@%Larklen> allow bi-direction on this one KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:34:01] <kypudo> best frist bi-di
[2022-12-16 21:34:02] <+stormblaz> always hug the wall
[2022-12-16 21:34:08] <spotchious> it is
[2022-12-16 21:34:08] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-16 21:34:10] <%Miestro> can someone link this real quick?
[2022-12-16 21:34:12] <spotchious> o
[2022-12-16 21:34:15] <Pretor3> its the same distance
[2022-12-16 21:34:16] <%Miestro> dm me if your not a sub
[2022-12-16 21:34:22] <JustRandomRussian> jump point should be the fastest
[2022-12-16 21:34:24] <%GFQPR1882> Do you think if this was a massive map that the AI would win waffleHmm
[2022-12-16 21:34:30] <@%Larklen> enable bi-direction on BFS :)
[2022-12-16 21:34:36] <%ForgottenTime> ^
[2022-12-16 21:34:37] <rawbits> They good for different tasks
[2022-12-16 21:34:50] <%+FrostedSentry> so this kind of thing is very practical if you like AI type things
[2022-12-16 21:34:51] <%Miestro> jump point looks at edges
[2022-12-16 21:35:07] <@%Larklen> KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:35:10] <@%Larklen> ant*
[2022-12-16 21:35:12] <%Miestro> becaue it calcualtes only straight paths between the edges
[2022-12-16 21:35:19] <%Tenkaichi500> sugarcube is the goal
[2022-12-16 21:35:20] <Morelia__> the antswer
[2022-12-16 21:35:21] <JustRandomRussian> gray points are basically skipped
[2022-12-16 21:35:28] <%ForgottenTime> Do best first with bi directional
[2022-12-16 21:35:39] <%GFQPR1882> that ant video was so good
[2022-12-16 21:35:40] <%$Tabakhase> https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/ btw @Miestro
[2022-12-16 21:35:46] <%Miestro> @Tabakhase thank you
[2022-12-16 21:35:48] <Marenti> LUL
[2022-12-16 21:35:50] <spotchious> A* should perform better than that
[2022-12-16 21:35:55] <Pretor3> fastest find i guess
[2022-12-16 21:35:57] <UndeadLeech> Not the shortest path, but it's fast.
[2022-12-16 21:36:04] <%ForgottenTime> But that was still found faster
[2022-12-16 21:36:05] <DecibelBlast> It tells you the length of the path
[2022-12-16 21:36:19] <+kenshin2666> but it is the best first
[2022-12-16 21:36:20] <nothingbout> Best-first-search seems to be fast because it doesn't necessarily find the optimal path. A* is always optimal
[2022-12-16 21:36:21] <Naxorian> read about how Tokio subway was designed @Giantwaffle its unbelivable
[2022-12-16 21:36:23] <+jmm548> 83.,43
[2022-12-16 21:36:32] <+dunpealhunter87> it says the operations at the bottom left
[2022-12-16 21:36:35] <%$Tabakhase> its WAY faster tho, 2.2 vs 0.7 ms
[2022-12-16 21:36:39] <%ForgottenTime> But does it tell you how long it takes to find it?
[2022-12-16 21:36:46] <@%Larklen> A8 designed Tokyo Trains Kappa
[2022-12-16 21:36:47] <@%Larklen> * A*
[2022-12-16 21:36:49] <@+Movinggun1> Support told me because I don't have my transaction ID for my original MC purchase from 2011 they can't prove its my account. ok lmao
[2022-12-16 21:36:49] <%Yogithebaer> wasnt the subway using algea like the ants thing
[2022-12-16 21:36:52] <%Helo_KiX> they used a fungus to design it, didn't they?
[2022-12-16 21:37:01] <%GFQPR1882> This is kl
[2022-12-16 21:37:02] <&%+Tech> Yeah, slime mold
[2022-12-16 21:37:02] <prsli> @Giantwaffle they used funghus

[2022-12-16 21:37:34] <+em_t_hed> only 20% smaller... that path never crosses to the other half of the screen
[2022-12-16 21:37:40] <panwaffle> They trained the algae to drive trains?
[2022-12-16 21:37:42] <%Helo_KiX> they placed food sources at where they needed stops and then let the slime mold grow and show the optimal paths
[2022-12-16 21:37:43] <+em_t_hed> top half bottom half
[2022-12-16 21:37:45] <+stormblaz> you are a fungi

[2022-12-16 21:40:08] <+stormblaz> how is fungus more smart than rocket science
[2022-12-16 21:40:09] <&%+Tech> But it also leaves out other factors like rivers, mountains, etc LUL

[2022-12-16 21:40:40] <%+allking4> The mold is just connecting dots, it doesnt know anything about cities that might prevent 'optimal node connections'

[2022-12-16 21:41:21] <%+Reaver_in_Black> the Slime tries to use the conservation of energy as best as it can to use this little as possible while being efficient at hunting

[2022-12-16 21:50:35] <%Crazyfox55> @Giantwaffle just ask ChatGPT to change your python code to C#
[2022-12-16 21:50:38] <mmpcode> you can do this with p5 like theCodingTrain
[2022-12-16 21:50:40] <+woodlaphroaig> That's why it was fun to start programing in QBasic. It was easy to do some kind of graphics
[2022-12-16 21:50:40] <Janzert> tkinter is very old gui
[2022-12-16 21:50:42] <%$Tabakhase> matplotlib or plotly are neat too
[2022-12-16 21:50:55] <Janzert> not really necessarily general purpose drawing
[2022-12-16 21:50:58] <belgianraiders> or gtk/klib i think

[2022-12-16 21:52:31] <@+Movinggun1> Honestly it depends how you learn
[2022-12-16 21:52:31] <jiwandi> @Giantwaffle how do you trim your beard, looks clean af
[2022-12-16 21:52:31] <@%Kuroiorb> also try different languages and see what you like
[2022-12-16 21:52:34] <panwaffle> Did you just say I should make a MMO?
[2022-12-16 21:52:34] <&%+Tech> MIT gives away their CS course for free btw
[2022-12-16 21:52:43] <@+Movinggun1> I found Udemy and other courses help me more than my degrees
[2022-12-16 21:52:45] <%+FrostedSentry> I would say, *focus*.... find the things you really care about... mobile vs. web or ...
[2022-12-16 21:52:52] <@%Kuroiorb> Udemy was super useful
[2022-12-16 21:52:57] <%lalashkin_G> I learnt that this is not about tool, aka language It's about what you need it for
[2022-12-16 21:52:59] <%$lazyeyesam> CS degrees are really just the tip of the iceberg. I learned everything I use now on the job
[2022-12-16 21:53:02] <+stormblaz> mit entire computer science is free yes

[2022-12-16 21:53:25] <@+Movinggun1> as a software engineer you should be able to pick up any language
[2022-12-16 21:53:29] <%DX_Plates> The logic not the language

[2022-12-16 22:01:42] <%+captain_chew> I prefer the F-22
[2022-12-16 22:01:44] <AllSham> the plane doesnt care but pilot and G force does care
[2022-12-16 22:01:46] <+stormblaz> can it stand still though?
[2022-12-16 22:01:54] <%RafaLorenzo> G warning OFF

[2022-12-16 22:02:06] <+DalSte> Yes. F-22 is the best
[2022-12-16 22:02:10] <%espi> define "best"
[2022-12-16 22:02:12] <%CRAZY__ENZO> 5th gen mods in DCS make 5th gen fighters look like UFOs
[2022-12-16 22:02:13] <Al_Kappaccino> i think the su is better

[2022-12-16 22:02:16] <+Sandboxie97> best at what?
[2022-12-16 22:02:16] <Al_Kappaccino> for dogfighting
[2022-12-16 22:02:22] <Entrymissing> Isn't it irrelevant in a world of radar guided missiles?
[2022-12-16 22:02:26] <%+SolarQuak3> f-22 was made for dog fighting

[2022-12-16 22:02:53] <%loafabreadly> The F-35b's VTOL is entirely automated too so the pilot in the crash was likely not at fault for the initial issue @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-16 22:02:53] <%+captain_chew> Did you see the f-35 vtol crash? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-16 22:02:54] <+DalSte> I play DCS some. Yeah but it’s hard
[2022-12-16 22:02:55] <%+Etwas77> hey guys
[2022-12-16 22:02:56] <+Sandboxie97> technically the typhoon has higher radar and missile range tahn the f22
[2022-12-16 22:02:59] <Wetware> The F-35 B is the marine variant to replace the Harrier
[2022-12-16 22:02:59] <%bmoneysmafia> f22 hits mach 1 without afterburners-- the only jets in USA that can do that
[2022-12-16 22:03:03] <+warcake> planes arent real sheeple
[2022-12-16 22:03:05] <Speedglass> its like a segway it can drive itself

[2022-12-16 22:03:10] <AllSham> why would you want to land F35B anyhwere? you cant refuel it on spot.. you cant rearm on spot... pilot's gear for CQB is shit...
[2022-12-16 22:03:23] <The_Holas> dont japan works on new jet Fx or something like that

[2022-12-16 22:03:45] <Rongoel> I mean again. The way of fightign in planes is. Spot first, Dont get seen, Shoot first then heck off
[2022-12-16 22:03:48] <%GFQPR1882> I think we should just call it the aim bot
[2022-12-16 22:03:51] <+DalSte> Hyper is above mach 5 .. Mach 3 is standard

[2022-12-16 22:45:21] <+em_t_hed> how do you twist the bottle for certain potions
[2022-12-16 22:45:33] <+em_t_hed> or rotate
[2022-12-16 22:45:50] <&%+Tech> Twist the bottle?
[2022-12-16 22:45:56] <Infinin> you use moon/sun salts for rotating the bottle
[2022-12-16 22:45:59] <DaemonSzyman> I wonder if it's locked by reputation or days played
[2022-12-16 22:46:01] <Dmw882> what is the benefit to crushing stuff vs just throwing it in the pot?
[2022-12-16 22:46:02] <+juujumon> @samitheberber I see, thank you! I was not sure. was wondering if you could just keep stacking
[2022-12-16 22:46:10] <+em_t_hed> yea so when he goes to the bottle depicted on the map, but its rotated
[2022-12-16 22:46:26] <%+TripleCakes> You can put them back even after you mash
[2022-12-16 22:46:33] <Billboul> you can cancel even if you crush
[2022-12-16 22:47:44] <%samitheberber> @Tech like in oil map they are slightly tilted and like the lightning resist waffle found a moment ago
[2022-12-16 22:48:01] <NotZigu> @Dmw882 crushing can maximize the path it can take, usually raw only does half the path
