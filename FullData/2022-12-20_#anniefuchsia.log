Is Luna always that way around you?? i mean mostly when you arent streaming?? or is it only when you stream that she is seeking so much attention?? if only when streaming, then i think its because you are talking to others than her :p (my cat does the same when i talk to other people)

[2022-12-20 16:09:21] <%PanicRush> does it give the number of people who wrote in chat at least once? never knew about this command @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-20 16:09:22] <%Collnaris> he gave you a tip LULE

[2022-12-20 16:09:26] <%Geoffku> oh yeah I learned about that command during new world times LULW
[2022-12-20 16:09:33] <%drzaius30> most rpg streams in general are quiet dudes off his rocker LUL
[2022-12-20 16:09:34] <%Lorrdzik> it is because their stream is on raider.io
[2022-12-20 16:09:37] <%Taylor131313> the command doesn't work for me Hmmm
[2022-12-20 16:09:40] <%+EddieMakes> so many of us are playing games at the same time
[2022-12-20 16:09:40] <%+MageTea> @PanicRush, It shows you how many people are connected to the chat
[2022-12-20 16:09:45] <SierraSoul> i typed chatters in lacaris stream and he had 400 less viewers than chatters LUL guess they muted him
[2022-12-20 16:09:48] <%Wardrick7> alsop on warcraftlogs
[2022-12-20 16:09:49] <%PanicRush> @MageTea i see NOTED
[2022-12-20 16:09:52] <%Lorrdzik> raider.io put other stream there too all from the race
[2022-12-20 16:09:58] <%Dantalion> @MageTea sup :D
[2022-12-20 16:10:01] <%Collnaris> especially if it's the first thing he asks when he joins stream
[2022-12-20 16:10:02] <Irhamel> It is somewhat reprehensible when people behave like that, I myself I'm a lurker, I do lurk on fairly likely, every streamer I follow. when the resume thingy came, it showed about  1500h of viewing, but no more than 300 chats messages
[2022-12-20 16:10:03] <%+MageTea> @Dantalion, yo PogU
[2022-12-20 16:10:08] <vonmaur> I watch the Echo stream but never chat, its pointless spam in there so not very appealing to type in that chat anyway.
[2022-12-20 16:10:12] <%Taylor131313> there might also be people watching you with chat closed

[2022-12-20 17:49:00] <%lesterofsmeg2> morning Annie how goes the battle
[2022-12-20 17:49:10] <%Taylor131313> I was wondering why they're setting a high enough level that basically makes it so you need to get a full set of gear before queuing solo shuffle @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-20 17:49:22] <%Collnaris> i thought taylor was going to
[2022-12-20 17:49:29] <%Swiggyswoo_> Hope someone makes it I want heroic PepeHands
[2022-12-20 17:49:39] <%+EddieMakes> because its fun having progression?
[2022-12-20 17:49:43] <JustAnts> because you get conquest and its rated?

[2022-12-20 17:50:26] <%Taylor131313> I mean I can make it with some help Coll, but the problem is indeed takns and healers, tanks especially
[2022-12-20 17:50:29] <%+EddieMakes> I peronally like it the way it is, having to do some bgs to get some gear, then arena. Feels nice
[2022-12-20 17:50:31] <%Taylor131313> I think Aegis is already locked
[2022-12-20 17:50:32] <adcad1> I have 5 30second ads twitch is being stupid with the amount of ads now LUL

[2022-12-20 17:50:58] <%PanicRush> @Taylor131313 worst case i can try tanking, but i will only be able to play in like 2 hours from now

[2022-12-20 18:13:43] <%Cryojaw> for ex. drakeraker set 408-412i Lvl but if u got the conquest more advanced set its 428, which doesnt share with the raker's so a third would imply easier iLevels since its origin level is higher (makes sense, but still)

[2022-12-20 20:49:45] <%Taylor131313> not to my knowledge KEKW

[2022-12-20 20:50:24] <%Taylor131313> xdd enjoy
[2022-12-20 20:50:27] <%PanicRush> yea no, i'll rather go fishing xddx

[2022-12-20 20:50:50] <%Geoffku> I'll just wait for next week Pepepains
[2022-12-20 20:51:03] <%Taylor131313> I find it funny that for me the hardest mechanic of raszageth normal was the fucking breath
[2022-12-20 20:51:14] <%Taylor131313> I couldn't dodge it to save my life in the first pulls xdd
[2022-12-20 20:51:15] <%Wardrick7> couldnt even get into higher than +10 this week Sadge
[2022-12-20 20:51:37] <%Geoffku> I thought the overhead breath was harder to dodge
[2022-12-20 20:51:45] <%Geoffku> I only died to the frontal on the first pull xdd
[2022-12-20 20:51:57] <%Wardrick7> breath is surprisingly stealthy mechanic LUL
[2022-12-20 20:52:04] <%drzaius30> That dragon breath reminded me so much of the twintania fight in ff seemed simple yet people kept fucking it up KEKW
[2022-12-20 20:52:06] <%Taylor131313> nah there I just looked up every now and again and I was ok
[2022-12-20 20:52:36] <%PanicRush> i failed to breath once when i fatfingered the direction button and dashed into it instead of to the side xdd
[2022-12-20 20:52:46] <%Taylor131313> but the other breath? I was like oh there's the sparks and oh swirlies better dodge this and OH WAIT THE FUCKING FRONTAL
[2022-12-20 20:53:27] <%Taylor131313> the hitbox is bigger than it looks though, once I was just on its side and it killed me anniesDude
[2022-12-20 20:53:32] <%Wardrick7> i died to it once cause i was Pepega
[2022-12-20 20:53:57] <%Wardrick7> i love that fight though, its really fun
[2022-12-20 20:54:09] <%drzaius30> oh i just realized rip noname

[2022-12-20 21:02:15] <%notzemy> Is it bad?
[2022-12-20 21:02:48] <%notzemy> Also I heard we can get tier pieces even from m+ pool but can't confirm it
[2022-12-20 21:03:30] <%PanicRush> it is bad because i got a 398 tier head from last boss on saturday xddgarlic
[2022-12-20 21:03:36] <%Taylor131313> anniesDude
[2022-12-20 21:04:00] <%Taylor131313> trade me tiers next raid so you don't have to worry about looting tier slot in vault :)

[2022-12-20 21:04:20] <%notzemy> I'm waiting for catalyst
[2022-12-20 21:04:39] <%Wardrick7> still too many weeks left until catalyst Sadge

[2022-12-20 21:11:22] <%Taylor131313> 4 set for demo is worth almost nothing LULW
[2022-12-20 21:11:24] <%Taylor131313> 2 set is worth a bit
[2022-12-20 21:12:51] <%PanicRush> 2 set for dh is whateverm 4 set is okay-ish
[2022-12-20 21:12:59] <%notzemy> Anyone doing some keys?
[2022-12-20 21:13:24] <%PanicRush> i am thinking to attempt one last try to do a key but idk
[2022-12-20 21:13:41] <%Taylor131313> DH tier set has a much bigger impact, almost 10%
[2022-12-20 21:14:33] <%Wardrick7> already saw a +10 sbg with required 385 and 1200 rating xdd
[2022-12-20 21:15:05] <%PneumaWHU> easy dungeon so lot's of signups
[2022-12-20 21:15:15] <%PanicRush> only 1200? Pog i saw a 1400 req earlier
[2022-12-20 21:15:27] <%notzemy> Not being 2000 score yet OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 21:17:25] <%Taylor131313> Max said they're reducing the hp of adds in rasz intermission by 50% xdd
[2022-12-20 21:17:40] <%Taylor131313> sounds about right since they could barely clear 1 platform by sending the entire raid there xdd
[2022-12-20 21:18:20] <%notzemy> My duck pet will hatch in 23 hours peepoOkay
[2022-12-20 21:18:42] <%Wardrick7> echo managed to clear 1 set of adds on both platforms and it was 10s left until next phase KEKW
[2022-12-20 21:18:57] <%notzemy> Faction change on sale, might go back to Alliance
[2022-12-20 21:19:02] <%notzemy> Not seeing group is annoying
[2022-12-20 21:19:08] <%Taylor131313> yeah they both got to the same point, with the current tuning it was impossible
[2022-12-20 21:21:01] <%drzaius30> Echo going to busy again in January new ultimate PepeLaugh
[2022-12-20 21:22:59] <%notzemy> If anyone is interested this week BfA world boss that can drop Alpaca mount is up

[2022-12-20 21:23:23] <%Taylor131313> don't think Echo is gonna dedicate much time to FF ultimate just yet Hmmm
[2022-12-20 21:23:33] <%Taylor131313> tier is still fresh
[2022-12-20 21:24:00] <%notzemy> Are you guys ready for Lfr Dathea? PauseChamp
[2022-12-20 21:24:15] <%notzemy> Or council
[2022-12-20 21:24:22] <%notzemy> Perma blue circles PepeLaugh
[2022-12-20 21:24:43] <%Taylor131313> yeah but they'll change them so they do no damage on LFR
[2022-12-20 21:24:47] <%Taylor131313> or so they don't spread
[2022-12-20 21:24:54] <%drzaius30> @Taylor131313 won't be out to end of jan and it took six months for clear last time LUL
[2022-12-20 21:25:14] <%drzaius30> blind prog though was cool to see
[2022-12-20 21:28:58] <%Wardrick7> they also took long breaks
[2022-12-20 21:29:05] <%drzaius30> Ye
