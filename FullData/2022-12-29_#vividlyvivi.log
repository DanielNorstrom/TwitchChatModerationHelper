[2022-12-29 12:42:55] <Tekkame_Ando> Many years ago for a birthday I received a bunch of bootlegged Yu Gi Oh cards that had been so poorly translated they were basically word salad. The one card I remember was called 'Black Spicy Cavalier', only recently did I learn it was actually called 'Dark Flare Knight'.
[2022-12-29 12:43:01] <namden2004> do you play yugioh masters dual?

[2022-12-29 12:43:34] <!%Goonyella> I remember buying a bunch of yugioh cards from one of those small stores at the train station and they were fakes
[2022-12-29 12:43:37] <Yggy_Ch> My absolute favorite fake card is the Man-Made Electronic Robot and, of course, the Darkly Big Rabbi

[2022-12-29 12:44:15] <Yggy_Ch> I'm so sad. I *used* to have Darkly Big Rabbi and Man-Made Electronic Robot
[2022-12-29 12:44:15] <angelframe> I lost my deck a long time ago. I had this cool card holder and every time I wanted to play a match I had to physically take the cards out of the little holder one by one.
