[2022-12-07 03:50:37] <@%Toonfish> oh yeah cactuslad did you catch my essay about french onion soup that chat turned into a copypasta?
[2022-12-07 03:52:11] <@%Toonfish> French onion soup is meh because if it has the toasted piece of bread on top, you can't effectively eat the bread or the soup because to cut the bread you'd have to push it into the soup, thus making the bowl overflow and to eat the soup you must bypass the bread. So you're stuck shoveling out soup from under the bread until you've finally lowered the level of soup in your bowl enough to be able to push down the bread far enough to cut it without it pushing the soup over the edge of the bowl.
[2022-12-07 03:52:13] <@%Toonfish> that one?

[2022-12-07 15:06:06] <@%Toonfish> in that case it takes a while to get going
[2022-12-07 15:06:20] <@%Toonfish> you need 40 u-235 to start with to get the kovarex enrichment process going
[2022-12-07 15:06:56] <@%Toonfish> if you have multiple centrifuges running the kovarex enrichment process make sure they don't split the u-235 between them
[2022-12-07 15:07:08] <@%Toonfish> put all of it into one so it can start working ASAP

[2022-12-07 21:51:47] <@%+ChubbyThePhat> I mean turning down settings in games now just makes them run worse because lower settings don't get optimized

[2022-12-07 21:54:22] <Meecow> since so many games run like shit and still sell well now executives think that gamers want games that run like shit

[2022-12-07 21:54:45] <%Abyssal_Hawk> it's funny, the only game I can think of that released recently that runs smoothly is Genshin LUL But that is also probably just my bad memory a bit too.
