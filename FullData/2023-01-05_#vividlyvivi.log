[2023-01-05 14:37:48] <Ribbions> Why people selling feet pics just google them

[2023-01-05 14:38:30] <ultragunner5> @Ribbions purchase implies ownership/exclusivity of the photo.

[2023-01-05 14:39:20] <%gabriebob> that's the tendon that controlls your fingers (specifically your middle one for that one, if you cut it your middle finger goes floppy)
[2023-01-05 14:39:26] VIEWERS: 283
[2023-01-05 14:39:34] <64bitrobot> depends on the framing of the leg
[2023-01-05 14:39:38] <%blu3g00> I actually don’t think the tendon would show from at this angle and pose

And yes there is actually someone on Twitch who speed-draws hentai and gets away with it because they draw so fast that Twitch doesn't realise what they're doing

[2023-01-05 15:35:24] <RoyalGraphX> the one we use is known as Gregorian Calender but others use different ones /,\ such as yeah muslim one

[2023-01-05 15:35:49] <%JohnnyTightIips> Daylight savings should have been banned when lightbulbs were invented
[2023-01-05 15:35:53] <%Xarlaxas> Daylight savings is so annoying.

[2023-01-05 15:36:08] <%gabriebob> Islamic and Chinese calenders are also Lunar calenders they run on the moon (and ladies periods) Adopting the Gregorian calender is however a requirement for joining the UN and being a recognised nation
[2023-01-05 15:36:14] <%CrisLeFortL> you could argue the vatican, a citystate, uses the lunar calendar (for the feast days)
[2023-01-05 15:36:20] <%healindawolf> oh they always say that

[2023-01-05 15:36:25] <%ultimateheroduh> in theory the US is making daylight savings permanent next year, in practice we've tried it before in the 70s and everyone ended up hating it so vividShrug
[2023-01-05 15:36:29] <EpicMagikarp> we should make a vivi calander which starts on the first video uploaded
[2023-01-05 15:36:29] <!%Flakklock> We have led lightbulbs we don't need daylight anymore

[2023-01-05 16:21:13] <slightlyblue132> Yo, this is looking great! ruithePRAISETHESUNHARDER
[2023-01-05 16:21:17] <%WolfLord11> yeah
[2023-01-05 16:21:18] <rexodiak> pillows are 90% of the time white
[2023-01-05 16:21:20] <%WolfLord11> mine do at least
[2023-01-05 16:21:24] <%ne0ncrucifix> You could make them white with some mint trim?
[2023-01-05 16:21:29] <%PatchouliKnowledge> You could get away with making them light pink.
[2023-01-05 16:21:31] <%FinnishFool> none of my sheets and pillows match koefKekw
[2023-01-05 16:21:42] <%+GokenMaster> Blue pillows, white duvet and bottom sheet, patchwork blanket, that's me
[2023-01-05 16:21:45] <%actuallymissing> really dark purple?
[2023-01-05 16:21:48] <rexodiak> a washed out/white-ish color
[2023-01-05 16:21:55] <%PatchouliKnowledge> Purple looks good though.
[2023-01-05 16:21:55] <!%Flakklock> Make her have one pillow without a case so it feels more realistic

[2023-01-05 16:22:23] <J_the_V> perhaps a brown/tan colour?

[2023-01-05 16:23:21] <J_the_V> beige is very light orange'ish pink
[2023-01-05 16:23:25] <%+GokenMaster> I just realized my pillow isn't blue, it's actually the same green as dreams shirt
[2023-01-05 16:23:25] <lil_4banger> a really light brown
[2023-01-05 16:23:29] <%actuallymissing> beige is just creamy white
