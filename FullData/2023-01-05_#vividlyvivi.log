[2023-01-05 14:39:20] <%gabriebob> that's the tendon that controlls your fingers (specifically your middle one for that one, if you cut it your middle finger goes floppy)
[2023-01-05 14:39:26] VIEWERS: 283
[2023-01-05 14:39:34] <64bitrobot> depends on the framing of the leg

And yes there is actually someone on Twitch who speed-draws hentai and gets away with it because they draw so fast that Twitch doesn't realise what they're doing

[2023-01-05 15:35:10] <ultragunner5> Chinese calendar
[2023-01-05 15:35:11] <%Xarlaxas> They have a 13 month calendar
[2023-01-05 15:35:13] <%CrisLeFortL> maybe some tribes follow their own calendar on things
[2023-01-05 15:35:13] <DRAWING_DAEMON> @ParadoxCatt rate my cringe from 1 to 10
[2023-01-05 15:35:14] <xiuzou_> iirc there are some religions with different calendar
[2023-01-05 15:35:16] <%gabriebob> Islamic and Chinese both have their own calenders
[2023-01-05 15:35:21] <+Midnyte64> There are few places that don't interact with the rest of the world.
[2023-01-05 15:35:24] <RoyalGraphX> the one we use is known as Gregorian Calender but others use different ones /,\ such as yeah muslim one
[2023-01-05 15:35:25] <%actuallymissing> Daylight savings are a thing of the past honestly...
[2023-01-05 15:35:28] <%healindawolf> hate dayliught savings
[2023-01-05 15:35:29] <!%Flakklock> Absolish daylight savings
[2023-01-05 15:35:39] <xiuzou_> and I know koreans have a "birthday" every new year. every korean

[2023-01-05 15:35:45] <Kie_Lockeir> I love having my sleep stolen by daylight savings, always fun
[2023-01-05 15:35:49] <%JohnnyTightIips> Daylight savings should have been banned when lightbulbs were invented
[2023-01-05 15:35:53] <%Xarlaxas> Daylight savings is so annoying.

[2023-01-05 15:36:03] <pazuzuhellmothvt> I work nightshift so daylight savings meant I had to work an extra hour
[2023-01-05 15:36:03] <%actuallymissing> Yeah it was invented to save down on candles but come on
[2023-01-05 15:36:06] VIEWERS: 454
[2023-01-05 15:36:08] <%gabriebob> Islamic and Chinese calenders are also Lunar calenders they run on the moon (and ladies periods) Adopting the Gregorian calender is however a requirement for joining the UN and being a recognised nation
[2023-01-05 15:36:14] <%CrisLeFortL> you could argue the vatican, a citystate, uses the lunar calendar (for the feast days)
[2023-01-05 15:36:20] <%healindawolf> oh they always say that
[2023-01-05 15:36:23] <CaptainLensFlares> Vivi you in WA/
[2023-01-05 15:36:24] <%JohnnyTightIips> I thought it was made because farmers were up early in the fields and were moaning about no light
[2023-01-05 15:36:24] <CaptainLensFlares> ?
[2023-01-05 15:36:25] <%ultimateheroduh> in theory the US is making daylight savings permanent next year, in practice we've tried it before in the 70s and everyone ended up hating it so vividShrug
[2023-01-05 15:36:29] <EpicMagikarp> we should make a vivi calander which starts on the first video uploaded
[2023-01-05 15:36:29] <!%Flakklock> We have led lightbulbs we don't need daylight anymore
[2023-01-05 15:36:38] <Kie_Lockeir> You mean things happen outside of anime, vtubing and gaming? Shit mate that's news to me
