[2022-12-23 11:24:21] <!Dornenspieler> imo it's the responsibility of Twitch to prevent botting, not the streamers :S

[2022-12-23 11:26:02] <ipponsky> sounds like a really weird system. tickets should be tied to the account, the email is just an extra in other sites....

[2022-12-23 11:29:35] <!Dornenspieler> also maybe prepare to move to youtube or tiktok or any other streaming platform just to be sure since you have 90 days to prepare just in case!

[2022-12-23 11:29:41] <$bl00ming> Nali save your streams on youtube
[2022-12-23 11:29:47] <%Vinnie_PT> And this is why se need the "value for value" tech to become mainstream

[2022-12-23 11:30:04] <@%^Nightbot> Hey, check out Nali's Youtube channel : https://youtube.com/@nalithea
[2022-12-23 11:30:44] <AtlantisPrince> The timing is really bad. Unlikely to get a response during all these holidays happening now. But I think, the moment you get a response, it will be resolved easily.
[2022-12-23 11:30:58] <pyroartic> it's like doing a job then your boss said hey. I think you're being sus so youre not gonna get paid.  email me asap. and just doesn't give you the email
[2022-12-23 11:31:08] <@%Grimstab77> The thing is, twitch needs to route and verify who is botting and from where. And this is gonna take time Nali'. Don't expect an answer before 1 week.
[2022-12-23 11:31:14] <@%Borky97> then it's pretty much a wait game and hoping they actually look
[2022-12-23 11:31:48] <%+Grim_Faith> tbh conditions for streamers on yt are better than on twitch
[2022-12-23 11:31:50] VIEWERS: 166
[2022-12-23 11:32:06] <%+Grim_Faith> only thing is you'll need some fanbase
[2022-12-23 11:32:17] <@%Borky97> I think it's mostly personal preference
[2022-12-23 11:32:32] <pyroartic> because twitch is like established as a streaming platform while YouTube is more established as a pre recorded site
[2022-12-23 11:32:45] <!Dornenspieler> at least you have 90 days to try and get a response nalithRage
[2022-12-23 11:32:47] <MoodieHoodieVT> if you do get suspended, make a backup account
[2022-12-23 11:33:01] <@%Borky97> yea 90 days at least gives u 3 months
[2022-12-23 11:33:20] <%+Grim_Faith> @Borky97 fair enough, just saying if you have a solid base you can step on youtube is the better platform. there's a reason why some big streamers moved to yt streaming. they get more out of streaming there
[2022-12-23 11:33:37] <@%Borky97> @grim_faith I agree I do agree bro

[2022-12-23 11:35:14] <pyroartic> @borky97 yes that's actually the main concern rn
[2022-12-23 11:35:16] <MoodieHoodieVT> hopefully twitch will let you stay instead of suspending you

[2022-12-23 11:35:52] <AtlantisPrince> Don't trust that guy with his friend working for Twitch though. Twitch employees have very strict contracts, and nobody would be so stupid to do favours.
[2022-12-23 11:36:15] <@%Grimstab77> Dw Nali', we're there to help
[2022-12-23 11:36:28] <MoodieHoodieVT> @grimstab77 yup

[2022-12-23 13:59:16] <%+Grim_Faith> nah when you're trying to protect your friend from a cheating partner you have to help them in any way you can
[2022-12-23 13:59:16] <@%Borky97> just sadge
[2022-12-23 13:59:19] <%farhood3000> idk even if they get brain washed i would rather have 2 haters out my life than that shit going on in my life
[2022-12-23 13:59:24] <%+pyromana192> You know what I would do it anyway if they are my friend and they start to hate me thats on them I care for my friends too much
[2022-12-23 13:59:34] <%+Grim_Faith> i once saved a friend from a girl that was manipulating him and cheating on him
[2022-12-23 13:59:38] <%DrazeLakeR> it happens when a couple has a fight as well. like they will patch up, but you will look bad just cos you were helping/moderating them during the fight period
[2022-12-23 13:59:47] <%+Grim_Faith> showed him solid proof and he was furious but not at me
[2022-12-23 13:59:55] <@%Borky97> it's just sadge

[2022-12-23 14:00:42] <arelfric> Isn't manipulation punished by law ? I guess it depends on the gravity of the situation but still manipulate minds is a dangerous game.
[2022-12-23 14:00:46] <@%Grimstab77> This girl
[2022-12-23 14:00:48] <@%Borky97> what a horrible woman.

[2022-12-23 14:01:02] <@%Grimstab77> This girl did something horrible. And that's not true
[2022-12-23 14:01:04] <+Subspl4y> if i was being cheated on, i would like someone to tell me instead of wasting more time in a relationship made arround lies

[2022-12-23 14:01:34] <D4RK_FanTazy_> ya luckily a friend of mine ended up having a dark past because of a manipulative girl but disappointingly he never learned a lesson
[2022-12-23 14:01:35] <@%Grimstab77> Tbh I agree xD
[2022-12-23 14:01:37] <%farhood3000> @Subspl4y this is why i would tell other ppl so they would do the same
[2022-12-23 14:01:51] <%Vinnie_PT> just tell her to sudo rm -rf /
[2022-12-23 14:01:52] <@%Borky97> some dude I was friends with would make fun of me saying that exact same thing how funny it would be for me to take myself out and write to him a letter about me taking myself out glad to say ik not friends with that horrible dude

[2022-12-23 14:03:34] <@%Borky97> @zxgodlysx u might wanna see profession help with that problem

[2022-12-23 14:03:42] <%farhood3000> i mean i was never in that situation but if i wanted to know if my partner is cheating on me i think it's only right to do it for others
[2022-12-23 14:03:42] <!%Pepetchi> What is payout?
[2022-12-23 14:03:55] <@%Grimstab77> @Pepetchi your pay

[2022-12-23 14:05:01] <@%Borky97> hard to say but for me mostly means that's not someone who is a true friend
[2022-12-23 14:05:02] <!%Pepetchi> Ah
[2022-12-23 14:05:31] <@%Borky97> yep manipulators do that
[2022-12-23 14:05:49] <arelfric> Oh btw even ads = 0€ ?
[2022-12-23 14:05:58] <@%CEC_Engineer02> Yeah it's hard to leave a manipulative relationship
[2022-12-23 14:06:00] <@%Grimstab77> Well, you know I agree with Nali'. People are generally in a weird relationship. They are also very addicted to each other. So once you kick in with some hard truth, the people react badly. Unconsciously they're gonna fight what you say to defend theirselves.
[2022-12-23 14:06:13] <%farhood3000> yea but trying to help is good
[2022-12-23 14:06:26] VIEWERS: 377
[2022-12-23 14:06:29] <!%Pepetchi> Kind of scary how Twitch can just suspend your account and deprive  you of your income
[2022-12-23 14:06:32] <%+pyromana192> do you get it if it gets unsuspended?
[2022-12-23 14:06:37] <D4RK_FanTazy_> One of my foolish friend did something foolish for a manipulative partner.
[2022-12-23 14:06:53] <@%Borky97> yep twitch seems to not care so much
[2022-12-23 14:06:58] <@%Grimstab77> So even if it is right, it's really hard to do it. And the closer to those people you are, the more likely it's gonna hurt your relationship to them.
[2022-12-23 14:07:00] <D4RK_FanTazy_> and they are no longer together
[2022-12-23 14:07:14] <%DrazeLakeR> NotLikeThis

[2022-12-23 14:07:47] <+Subspl4y> does the money just stay stuck in the void or it get sent to you after the suspention is over?
