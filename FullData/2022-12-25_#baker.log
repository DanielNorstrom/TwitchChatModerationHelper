[2022-12-25 00:26:05] <%polig> you need 3 of them i think
[2022-12-25 00:26:06] <%+TheTruNoobie> if you're doing anything besides herb-only runs in plat fields you are making a mistake
[2022-12-25 00:26:09] <%Official_n3ophyte> just got home, kiddo sleeping time for dailys
[2022-12-25 00:26:36] <%polig> i mean its 100k if what he said is correct :D
[2022-12-25 00:26:47] <%polig> that dude which say its 10k per run
[2022-12-25 00:26:48] <%+TheTruNoobie> the green thumb buff is so strong; having that up and gathering nonstop is so much more than you are getting from mining or cutting trees

[2022-12-25 00:27:39] <%polig> basicly its simple, you run around the map picking all the flowers once, bring back thingies to the middle that reset the map run around again gg

[2022-12-25 00:30:23] <%Nikodermos> yeah thats true those two big ban waves were noticeable
[2022-12-25 00:30:57] <%Nikodermos> when need more of those. bots in boss rush consistently lately again

[2022-12-25 00:35:40] <%polig> buy gems now
[2022-12-25 00:35:43] <%polig> in 2 months
[2022-12-25 00:35:45] <%polig> gems 20k
[2022-12-25 00:35:48] <%polig> mark my words
[2022-12-25 00:35:56] <%polig> lvl 7
[2022-12-25 00:36:20] <%Renektolijus> y tho, most of the player base already has lvl 7s, or am I wrong?
[2022-12-25 00:36:29] <%polig> yes
[2022-12-25 00:36:32] <%polig> but not 10
[2022-12-25 00:36:34] <%polig> not 9
[2022-12-25 00:36:44] <%Official_n3ophyte> same i have tons of those going to waste since next im gonna do is artist
[2022-12-25 00:36:50] <%polig> and once you got that weapon to +20 which is not that hard
[2022-12-25 00:36:52] <JaxeEnGames> what are the gem gains in void chaos dungs and hard boss rush compared to a step under?
[2022-12-25 00:36:54] <%polig> what else do you do?
[2022-12-25 00:36:56] <%Renektolijus> so the same premise works for lvl 1 gems as well lol
[2022-12-25 00:37:14] VIEWERS: 464
[2022-12-25 00:37:42] <%polig> @Renektolijus its insane hard to buy lower gems because of cooldown on buying you have, even with lvl 3s you need to buy like 90 of them and takes like 30 mins
[2022-12-25 00:37:53] <%Renektolijus> ahh yes the cooldown
[2022-12-25 00:38:04] <%polig> its actualy cheaper to buy lvl 7 from 3s but its 30mins
[2022-12-25 00:38:13] <%Renektolijus> makes sense, ty
[2022-12-25 00:38:18] <%polig> cheaper to buy 3s than 7
[2022-12-25 00:38:42] <%polig> yeah go have that nice moose penis
[2022-12-25 00:38:48] <%polig> i mean sausage

[2022-12-25 18:49:57] <%+TrickmasteH> You have to have fast fingers.
[2022-12-25 18:50:09] <%+alex__gfy> i wasnt a huge fan of the "mouse dance" lunar does

[2022-12-25 23:34:50] <%ItsMyDna> you get a key to a specific dungeon
[2022-12-25 23:35:04] <@%+strengthie> First time I've played DPS in a loooong time
[2022-12-25 23:35:13] <%ItsMyDna> and you can increase the difficulty of the next key when you do good in the dungeon
[2022-12-25 23:35:18] <AncientCapitals> you get a new key after each dungeon but it rotates to different dungeons
[2022-12-25 23:35:32] <%ItsMyDna> @strengthie whats your class/spec? and what server?
[2022-12-25 23:35:56] <@%+strengthie> If you complete the dungeon under the time limit it upgrades the key and rolls it to another random dungeon

[2022-12-25 23:39:35] <%+FireZky> now it has more buttons what is more great
[2022-12-25 23:39:38] <%+FireZky> then at legion
[2022-12-25 23:39:41] <%ItsMyDna> but learning new classes in WoW is very hard I feel, atleast for me @strengthie
[2022-12-25 23:39:54] <%ItsMyDna> to play properly
[2022-12-25 23:39:55] <%+ibkstorm> I could come on dps if you need

[2022-12-25 23:40:51] <%ItsMyDna> @strengthie definetly but you can also dumb down your build with switching talents, its very nice to learn the class
[2022-12-25 23:41:00] <@%+strengthie> @FireZky I agree but it's making learning a new class a bit harder than normal :P
[2022-12-25 23:41:03] <%ItsMyDna> and then step by step get more talents
[2022-12-25 23:41:15] <@%+strengthie> nah I'm a trial by fire kind of guy
[2022-12-25 23:41:21] <%ItsMyDna> hahha
[2022-12-25 23:41:34] <%ItsMyDna> i mean its not WoW until all the actionsbars are filled
[2022-12-25 23:41:45] <%+FireZky> @strengthie Yeah it can be harder for new player definetly. But if u played already most classes i don't think its too hard for them
