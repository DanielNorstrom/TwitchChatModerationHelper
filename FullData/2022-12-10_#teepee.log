[2022-12-10 04:10:22] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-10 06:03:33] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-10 15:43:25] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info
[2022-12-10 15:43:25] <+deadtreebark> verdansk and rebirth were so good
[2022-12-10 15:43:32] <%+Hhamma> @jagerbomblive no doubt if you add basic things like crossplay and a buyback mechanic to blackout it’s a better game than warzone

[2022-12-10 16:03:28] <%JayHass21> Spreading their resources too thin so therefore everything suffers
[2022-12-10 16:03:28] <%+vongolafiamme> COD somehow made a Godzilla event boring
[2022-12-10 16:03:43] <%Jasetheace2> What's scary to me is that this is the best they could do with a full 3-year cycle

[2022-12-10 16:03:46] <%fishingdev> They have to rush features to meet a deadline …that causes massive hard to find bugs
[2022-12-10 16:03:50] <%+cogs26> @teepee that’s part of the people in terms of culture though like just hire more devs then
[2022-12-10 16:03:55] <%$youenjoyymyself> The game is designed to cater to casuals, because the profit increases with a larger fanbase who enjoys the game. Add that with unrealistic dev demands and you have products like this

[2022-12-10 16:07:48] <%+H3YP0PPY> Streamers are a major driving force for these games.  If they were smart they would have a group of streamers that they consult on a regular basis to make the game better, but it is clear they care about nothing but $$$$$$

It was DMZ then this fucking car thing and the Raid mode. I see why they aren’t fixing shit. Wish they’d stop trying to be every other game but COD cuz this game could be so damn good.

[2022-12-10 16:18:41] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-10 17:23:21] <Marronsy> I prefer DMZ, because as soon as we start a warzone game our shutter teammate always appears and we constantly have to carry him

[2022-12-10 17:24:07] <%+mockytdm> Yes he's on the field but he's absent from action
[2022-12-10 17:24:08] <wearycolt607900> Ronaldo is on. They’ll lose

[2022-12-10 17:24:38] <%+MiggyMxG> @bladerunnerking lmao hey, that’s not a bad step brother to have!
[2022-12-10 17:24:47] <%ToiletDestroyer666> It’s so interesting to me. Warzone made them so much money but instead of asking how do we make Warzone better they’re like how do we get the small Tarkov audience interested. I love Tarkov but it’s a totally different style of game than COD
[2022-12-10 17:24:49] <%Manfredi15> I want Marrocco to win but I realize this is probs Messi's and Ronaldo's last chance to compete in the WC

[2022-12-10 19:02:46] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-10 20:49:24] <%+blaowplaow> @WatermelonCrunch I can agree with that.  I don't think removing them entirely is the move.  Otherwise you might as well take out strongholds and black sites.  But I agree with you on that

[2022-12-10 21:10:23] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-10 21:20:56] <+bigbuckhunta26> Hey chat! I was curious with the nukes, when you complete it does the win streak start over and you have to win another 5 before you can do the next nuke challenge. That video of teep and the boys getting 4 nukes in a row is amazing! I’m lucky to get 2 wins in a row!

[2022-12-10 21:25:15] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info
