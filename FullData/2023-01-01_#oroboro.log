[2023-01-01 03:38:54] <Excelumin> crazy how they made this spell an item in ER
[2023-01-01 03:38:57] <!%MadGamer> @Oroboro is it explained in lore why these dragon kngihts honor bow and watch you 1v1

[2023-01-01 03:39:14] <+maddhouse_007> People don’t like dark souls 2 because it’s not dark souls 1 again
[2023-01-01 03:39:20] <%KungFuAndrew> DS2 is great because of all the enemies, just a couple that are annoying, and they're both in this stage LUL
[2023-01-01 03:39:27] <!%MadGamer> cause in base dark souls 2 they are just asshats
[2023-01-01 03:39:34] <%KungFuAndrew> They only fight you if you ignore the huge knights

[2023-01-01 03:39:44] <%KungFuAndrew> Kill the huge knights and they won't fight
[2023-01-01 03:39:45] <!%Ebonslayer> @MadGamer No, but the Dragon Covenant is essentially the duel covenant. They want you to duel your way to the end.
[2023-01-01 03:39:48] <%+Silthous> Giga-Chad dragon bros
[2023-01-01 03:39:50] <Destructive_Forces> I think they are also not concerned with you because they assume nothing can fuck with the Ancient Dragon
[2023-01-01 03:39:58] <Accer666> If you summon the chad npc they chase as well
[2023-01-01 03:40:04] <!%Ebonslayer> @MadGamer If you run past enemies they actually aggro.
[2023-01-01 03:40:06] <%Abashedclover> You should do a DS1 stream and say its your first playthru just to see how many dumb dumbs come in here

[2023-01-01 03:40:34] <@%Pallydan9K> Oro the worst part is these enemies don’t drop their armor and weapons more than once
[2023-01-01 03:40:39] <%KungFuAndrew> You would have to hold the controller upside down and backwards to make it look like it's your first time
[2023-01-01 03:40:46] <%thealbinopanda> playing Souls games with mnk monkaS

[2023-01-01 03:40:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @MadGamer SotFS tried to make the game more lore accurate or fitting. Instead of random enemies doing random things or being in random places.
[2023-01-01 03:40:54] <Tylerjsmith97> like Hades and such
[2023-01-01 03:40:59] <@%Pallydan9K> This npc isn’t cheating
[2023-01-01 03:41:00] <Alextreides> I remember those dragon worshippers ganking me in the big stairs. Really honorabru
[2023-01-01 03:41:05] <Tylerjsmith97> like i dont know why my hands cant relax on a controller
[2023-01-01 03:41:08] <%+Silthous> Elden Ring might be the only one you can get away with using Keyboard and Mouse
[2023-01-01 03:41:15] <%KungFuAndrew> People do speedruns with KB/M for the extremely fast menuing, but controller is still superior for anything else
[2023-01-01 03:41:16] <marbletabletop> i play keyboard and mouse 🙃
[2023-01-01 03:41:19] <+sfzgxd> like for honor

[2023-01-01 03:41:21] <DefiantOneGaming> I find hades easier with mnk because spacebar is easy to spam for dash
[2023-01-01 03:41:27] <septentrion2> 🥚
[2023-01-01 03:41:28] <+OMFG_COOKIES> hades actually playes way more responsively with keyboard and mouse

[2023-01-01 03:41:33] <!%MadGamer> @Ebonslayer i see i still found it odd how they put a dragon oustide the dragonslayer boss area but thats just me

[2023-01-01 03:41:37] <%Abashedclover> I have a friend who only plays souls games with keyboard and mouse and does pretty well with it. we all call him insane

[2023-01-01 03:41:50] <Tylerjsmith97> @DefiantOneGaming i tend to do a lot of dash attacks so yeah makes sense

[2023-01-01 03:42:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @MadGamer I think the intention there is it's supposed to be the Dragonrider's dragon, but it's on the other end of the area.
[2023-01-01 03:42:01] <cortez00021> Play on dancepad
[2023-01-01 03:42:02] <%KungFuAndrew> @koopatroopa128 Like that one British streamer

[2023-01-01 03:42:52] <%keeran8894> a lot of the genius of ER is owed to DS2. lots of cool ER ideas started here. it might be the black sheep of the series, but it's still underrated imo

[2023-01-01 03:43:21] <%KungFuAndrew> @keeran8894 It's only a black sheep to the 10 people that continually whine about it to the end of time. A lot of us actually enjoy it

[2023-01-01 03:43:48] <!%Eric4bz> @Oroboro blue flame is fun. Blue flame mainhand, staff off hand, then you switch out the staff to a shield and people think you can't cast spells anymore
[2023-01-01 03:43:48] <Accer666> The casting is bad with blue flame tho

[2023-01-01 04:30:14] <%KungFuAndrew> @Darkjackl It's a decent light armor, yes. Low poise and low lightning resist though

[2023-01-01 04:31:31] <xanarace> havel gloves though right? unless i'm having delusions
[2023-01-01 04:31:32] <+dragonviper_> one of the biggest things i miss from ds2 are the invasion auras, having sick ass auras from arena rank was so cool, and they were visually incredible. Made grinding arena worth

[2023-01-01 04:32:44] <!AuroraUnit486> @joemurray thats the best thing about DS2, you can use pretty much anything
[2023-01-01 04:32:44] <Casualsunpraiser> sorry im back my power went out
[2023-01-01 04:32:45] <MichaelDLonzo> @joemurray longsword
[2023-01-01 04:32:49] <Darkjackl> i mean, best is subjective due to playstyles
[2023-01-01 04:32:50] <notKawalski> maybe it's because this faction has a special red colour depending on your level within the faction
[2023-01-01 04:32:50] <!AuroraUnit486> as long as you're good anything is viable
[2023-01-01 04:32:51] <+dragonviper_> @joemurray warped sword or any rapier
[2023-01-01 04:32:54] <sifthelunarwolf> maybe
[2023-01-01 04:32:54] <+buddahsmokegaming> ds2 lvl?
[2023-01-01 04:32:58] <%KungFuAndrew> @joemurray Best DS2 weapon? The one you are the best at using. But some good ideas are spears, katanas, longswords, claymores, halberds, axes...hehe, :)
[2023-01-01 04:32:59] <Squgg> oro if you were a piece of ham what would you do
[2023-01-01 04:33:02] <CrimsieThorne> maybe you just gotta change colour and then back to host?
[2023-01-01 04:33:03] <notKawalski> meant covenant, instead of faction
[2023-01-01 04:33:09] <+joemurray> @auroraunit486 that’s good in Elden ring I’m used to people using spears atmo
[2023-01-01 04:33:13] <Enleiv> Covenant adds a rank effect that overrides maybe?
[2023-01-01 04:33:17] <+joemurray> @dragonviper_ will check out warped sword
[2023-01-01 04:33:27] <CrimsieThorne> ohh
[2023-01-01 04:33:31] <Darkjackl> slightly different
[2023-01-01 04:33:37] <+joemurray> @kungfuandrew thank you ! Will try some different ones out
[2023-01-01 04:33:41] <XzKutor> if you kill 100 people it glows and stuff if i remember correctly?
[2023-01-01 04:33:41] <con_d_oriano__> damn surprised anyone is on ds2 at this point
[2023-01-01 04:33:42] <!%Ebonslayer> It's probably so it's related to rank.
[2023-01-01 04:33:43] <notKawalski> the red is more intense depending on your PVP level
[2023-01-01 04:33:47] <+dragonviper_> @joemurray grab warped sword and spam running attacks and your good lol, r1s are super fast as well with good poise damage
[2023-01-01 04:33:50] <+Deevon667> rank up gives a burning glow
[2023-01-01 04:33:51] <koopatroopa128> it only changes after winning a lot on the arena
[2023-01-01 04:33:55] <+sfzgxd> probably because of the ranking changing your aure color to be lighter
[2023-01-01 04:33:59] <aliciatriad> Oh I didn't know they brought back pvp.
[2023-01-01 04:33:59] <%KungFuAndrew> @joemurray Yeah. It's really well balanced. You can get good with something and still be competitive.
