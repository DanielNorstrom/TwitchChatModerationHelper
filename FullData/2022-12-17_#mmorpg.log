[2022-12-17 14:54:01] <+bunnycups1> maybe I'm wrong, but I think adding a new skill is a developer time waste, and another mind numbing grind that's just not enjoyable.

[2022-12-17 14:55:05] <KovuRS3> I think if they were going to do something like sailing, it'd make sense to do it more like Arc in RS3 -- discover islands with new skilling methods for existing skills etc.
