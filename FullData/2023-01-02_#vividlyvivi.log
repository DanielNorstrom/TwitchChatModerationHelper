[2023-01-02 14:10:03] <UOOH_Connoisseur> so girl bullying is like a nagatoro chapter?
[2023-01-02 14:10:03] <Dulark> We also had "class nights" which were just inter-gender games for 3 hours after classes. But really it was just a way for the school to get boys and girls to stop avoiding one another.

[2023-01-02 14:10:41] <zach_shield> This is just my opinion, is that the easy part about being bullied by guys is that I could just start an all out brawl. But with girls? Nah bruh, you couldnt lay a finger on em for MULTIPLE reasons. Hell, calling them a bitch would just have em fake cry and I would be the one on the end of a scolding cuz I called em a bitch

[2023-01-02 14:11:10] <Dulark> Girl and boy bullies are different because if a boy tries to mentally destroy you, you fight and then thats that. The bully saw your limit and you stood up for yourself, whoever wins. But you cant hit girls, so they will just keep going.

[2023-01-02 14:18:28] <%sorbles> @Tighron and because websites don't want you to tell them no, they make saying no way harder and practically impossible to completely deny it.

[2023-01-02 14:19:10] <%HYuy117> twitter is utter cancer. The fact that people hyper react to a single tweet is bull.
[2023-01-02 14:19:17] <zach_shield> Goddamn
[2023-01-02 14:19:21] <@%+swivelhipsmith> I aint gonna hold ya, the damage the internet age has done on a social level is fucked and irreversible
[2023-01-02 14:19:24] <Tighron> @Tighron depends a bit on where the servers are physicaly. when you choose "manage my settings"  most arent allowed to have anything checked, so you can go manage->save immediately.
[2023-01-02 14:19:28] <Dulark> You can tell we arent an evolved species by the fact that happened to that lady, and theres people still using social media.
[2023-01-02 14:19:29] <%Dragonator_g> Nothing can justify that kind of stuff. It was a bad joke, but not death-thread worthy.

[2023-01-02 14:38:26] <Gravy_Gator> I see it as completely fine to pirate stuff you can't get. Like if I can't get an anime or a game then hell yeah I'm gonna pirate it because you won't let me throw money at you for it.

[2023-01-02 14:38:58] <vecilias> i find game preservation really weird cus games are the only medium i can think of where old content is not reproduced, like you can buy or get most old tv shows and movies and songs.
[2023-01-02 14:39:01] <+ReynTime243> there's also the inflated prices some resellers price them for
[2023-01-02 14:39:01] <@%+swivelhipsmith> looking back on that godhand I bought, $200 just went to some dipshit who doesnt care
[2023-01-02 14:39:11] <%robinthebobbin99> Nintendo actually released the first Fire Emblem for the Switch... for a limited amount of time, now it's gone again!
[2023-01-02 14:39:13] <Coppertine> It's like retail, the manufactur / publisher is already paid by the store.. so steal it and you are good.. just don't do that
[2023-01-02 14:39:16] <the_lo_sama> if i owned a game a game at any point in my life or if i cant buy it from the creator im pirating that shit

[2023-01-02 14:40:41] <%sorbles> @godworrior1 Emulation is not illegal. However if you download a rom, that's technically piracy even if you own it. In some regions there is a legal concept called format shifting, which can be argued makes ripping legal, as long as you do it yourself.
[2023-01-02 14:40:46] <%Benimus_Prime> And no sharing passwords now you thieves!

[2023-01-02 14:41:34] <%Dragonator_g> But it's still a form of monopoly. It wouldn't be a monopoly if you could get the same series from two or more streamers.
[2023-01-02 14:41:34] <@%FortuynSeven> It was unironically good when anime was with crunchyroll. Even how shit it was at least I had the option to payt for one sub

[2023-01-02 14:44:54] VIEWERS: 423
[2023-01-02 14:44:55] <Dulark> Wow for decadess had the issue that they didnt have the original files to release classic until a few years ago
[2023-01-02 14:45:00] <@%Comradeforge> Square enix lost so much source code shit that every "Remaster release" is completely fucked
[2023-01-02 14:45:02] <@%FortuynSeven> and used private servers to rebuilt vividLul
[2023-01-02 14:45:02] <%PatchouliKnowledge> When they do remakes sometimes they only have the same retail copy you do.
[2023-01-02 14:45:03] <%Scar_Red_Tiger> Companies close and shit gets thrown out
[2023-01-02 14:45:05] <%monkeydgrif> Didn't that happen with the crash bandicoot?
[2023-01-02 14:45:06] <%PatchouliKnowledge> It's insane.
[2023-01-02 14:45:06] <%$Palulukan880> Disney isn’t going to be a monopoly since the boneheaded executives and their decisions managed to bring their stocks to their worst level since the previous Disney dark age in the 1970s.  So we’re safe.
[2023-01-02 14:45:09] <@%+swivelhipsmith> FUN FACT: game devs in japan would delete their source code because they didnt think they would need it
[2023-01-02 14:45:11] <AnthineAmaseth> from what i know enix lost the back files for the old NES game crystalis....xD
[2023-01-02 14:45:13] <@%+swivelhipsmith> thats why
[2023-01-02 14:45:17] <%robinthebobbin99> That's why piracy is important
[2023-01-02 14:45:17] <@%FortuynSeven> Viv when are we playing WoW

[2023-01-02 14:45:19] <%Benimus_Prime> yeah, no OG copy, had to rebuild WoW vanilla from ground up
[2023-01-02 14:45:20] <+tenhats> Pirates are saints
[2023-01-02 14:45:21] <Gravy_Gator> Steal shit in the name of preservation
[2023-01-02 14:45:24] <%MataNui95> FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE
[2023-01-02 14:45:24] <Damekie> FortuynSeven real ? veiOMEGALUL
[2023-01-02 14:45:27] <bullsquid_> That's why the remasters of silent hill 2 and 3 were so trash. They had to rebuild it froma  broken pre-alpha build
[2023-01-02 14:45:32] <%HYuy117> the problem is once it's compiled, unless you keep the source, it's impossible to modify (the compiled finished product is basically uneditable without extreme reverse engineering)
[2023-01-02 14:45:36] <%sorbles> mind you source code is different from release.
[2023-01-02 14:45:39] <eclipsekitsune51> damn, it's a shame this is what happens to so many games
[2023-01-02 14:45:42] <HyperMetalix> oh yeah Toy Story lost all of their assets, and had to remake all the models from scratch for future films
[2023-01-02 14:45:43] <%Dragonator_g> Companies close down and servers just get auctioned off, backups and all.
[2023-01-02 14:45:43] <%captainshotgun> Support your local crime families! 😤💜
[2023-01-02 14:45:44] <@%FortuynSeven> I would destroy you in Warcraft 1
[2023-01-02 14:45:47] <LordAziki> Didn't Rockstar get caught selling a pirated version of one of their games once?
[2023-01-02 14:45:47] <!%tlombard2000> i think most of that was because storage space was non-existant back in the day, so keeping all of the old sources of an uncompressed game would take up so much fuckin space
[2023-01-02 14:45:49] <%HYuy117> YES!!!

[2023-01-02 14:46:56] <@%+swivelhipsmith> btw I found out when it comes to some leaked source codes its a huge gray area legally
[2023-01-02 14:46:56] <katzen_aidit> Toy Story 1 had a mother who had the copy for hwr work home which saves the entire movie
[2023-01-02 14:46:57] <@%+swivelhipsmith> so uhhh

[2023-01-02 14:47:09] <DreadgeNought> Would also be nice if the Big Devs like Nintendo were legally required by Global Law to respect the rights of Independent / Private Developers who wish to content create as fans;  like say for BoTW to make betterments to things like THE LACK OF CRAFTING by the towns places etc.  Such they could then sell their work to the owners if released.
[2023-01-02 14:47:10] <22hobbies> YouTube's policy now apparently let's them delete videos if you're inactive for too long

[2023-01-02 14:49:14] <%Tasrayryn> There was an anime series called Ninja Robots in English that was only released in limited English regions, including Australia. Half the original dub copies were lost so they were never able to be released after the original run. A digital preservation company put out a plea for anyone with VHS recordings to send them in so that they could remaster the whole series for rerelease. They ended up having to dub 2 minutes themselves because no one had the original

[2023-01-02 14:51:17] <badassm1ner> as a wee lad I played my PS3 on a CRT, I would sometimes record my gameplay on VHS
[2023-01-02 14:51:19] <LordAziki> It was illegal, but it was also the norm.
[2023-01-02 14:51:19] <Damekie> my grandpa recorded movies for me and my sister to watch FeelsStrongMan
[2023-01-02 14:51:20] <Dulark> It was fine, they didnt have a way to remonetize that like they do now with streaming services and online retail.

[2023-01-02 14:51:32] <%Scar_Red_Tiger> There was a kickstarter to re-release an OVA. They found other Anime filmreels in the same warehouse they thought were lost.
[2023-01-02 14:51:37] <%$Cheaties> it wasn't really advertised until dvr came out
[2023-01-02 14:51:37] <%PatchouliKnowledge> It was impossible to do anything about it honestly.
[2023-01-02 14:51:39] <%Dragonator_g> They made a big deal when VHS and when audio casettes came out
[2023-01-02 14:51:39] <HyperMetalix> as long as you didn't use the recording for your own public broadcast

[2023-01-02 14:52:54] <Hoax415> there was tech that would allow a vcr to record a channel that you weren't watching or even while u watched another channel. and the $$$ fought that in court over piracy concerns etc. its always been that way, goes all the way to tapes

[2023-01-02 15:29:11] <%WhiteWolfe858> There is graffiti of a Viking bodyguard in a Roman temple when he was guarding the emperor.
[2023-01-02 15:29:11] <%RecruitDecanusDeadSea> The Romans were carving dongs into walls thousands of years before us
[2023-01-02 15:29:12] <%robinthebobbin99> Man, that's deep...

[2023-01-02 15:29:41] <&%+Jack__Mango> especially my roomie and some irl peeps
[2023-01-02 15:29:48] <Dulark> Ofcourse.
[2023-01-02 15:29:49] <&%+Jack__Mango> vivi they would
[2023-01-02 15:29:49] <%MelkorTheGreat> Overly Sarcastic Productions would probably do it.
[2023-01-02 15:29:50] <%Scar_Red_Tiger> My grandpa was always big on "Read. Learn something new every day."
[2023-01-02 15:29:51] <CryHavoc_12> Yes :3

[2023-01-02 15:30:18] <%Dragonator_g> Ask a nerd to nerd out about their favorite topic with an audience?

[2023-01-02 16:01:18] <%godworrior1> In the Netherlands, we have green for household waste, then brown for compost, and then black for paper
[2023-01-02 16:01:18] <%TheWildDoge> in america it varies. i can go to a different county just a few miles away and its totally different rules
[2023-01-02 16:01:19] <$GDoomDog> I live in Nsw we don't have a yellow bin in my town

[2023-01-02 16:01:32] <%captainshotgun> Oh ok that makes sense.
[2023-01-02 16:01:32] <LordAziki> The system where I live is generally ignoring recycling bins and tossing everything in trash.
[2023-01-02 16:01:47] <WireframeVT> My apartment has just trash and recycling. My family home is just trash, no recycling. my sis lived in a house where she had to take the trash in her truck to the dump.
[2023-01-02 16:01:48] <%ImThatOneDeadGuy> Green: Druid waste, Yellow: Fighter waste, Blue: Wizard waste. its simple
[2023-01-02 16:01:53] <dat_boyf> @LordAziki system brought to you by rodents
[2023-01-02 16:02:02] <Damekie> 3 in germany as well, yellow for plastics and other materials, blue for paper/cardboard and then black for general garbage
[2023-01-02 16:02:05] <kenomyalo> USA is inconsistent about the organic waste thing. Usually if they do it at all, it's shoved into heavy paper bags of sorts and picked up whole, no permanent bin.
[2023-01-02 16:02:14] <DarrenJames000> I got a mowing subscription too
[2023-01-02 16:02:28] <%MataNui95> thats an american rural thing

[2023-01-02 16:03:43] <LordAziki> Recycling picked up in the US when the plastic industry cut down trees and put a couple hundred more buses on the streets to recycle plastic.
