[2022-12-23 16:16:19] <tomc1k> idk if they gonna report it
[2022-12-23 16:16:29] <luxuschris> @saffeboie Thank you. then the cops was very aggressive.
[2022-12-23 16:16:40] <%+Shaado8> he lost his cool it happens
[2022-12-23 16:16:42] <FenixSoars> This was insanely early in the chase
[2022-12-23 16:16:44] <DRAG_19> do someone have to report him for that ?
[2022-12-23 16:16:45] <%Scuba_SK> they spike ramee i think barley 15 minutes into the meth run

[2022-12-23 16:16:59] <tomc1k> it was pretty earlly, no tazers shots, nothing
[2022-12-23 16:17:00] <%caponegobuckeyes> They got aggressive because they thought someone on the crime side put down spikes but they didnt

[2022-12-23 16:18:15] <+silvahawk21> ye but when he preaches about not just shooting and then he does that just makes him look like a hypocrite
[2022-12-23 16:18:16] <+Kollectiv> @HutchMF can he get banned if nobody reports him? IE the mods see the chat outside the game?

[2022-12-23 16:45:38] <Theballer463> why do you think they help the cops so much because they know that if they had equal numbers and equal mechanics they would get fucked 90% of the time

[2022-12-23 16:47:27] <%DocNasty1020> so the cops keep logging in
[2022-12-23 16:47:33] <%+VexedVarianT> cars drive better guns shoot better
[2022-12-23 16:47:34] <+Waffles19SD> why do cops get to provoke and escalate things even wiht each other? like how they talked to you
[2022-12-23 16:47:38] <nuevoleonstyle7> @hutchmf why is there no cop to crim limit?
[2022-12-23 16:47:44] <+TitanRIU> its basically like playing a game with cheats on haha
[2022-12-23 16:47:46] <%UrTragic> some of these cops wouldnt last in 2.0
[2022-12-23 16:47:51] <%d3ltaf0x> Cops: we should have all the advantaged its like this on irl , i laugh so much at this logic
[2022-12-23 16:48:04] <%+VexedVarianT> no ooc punishment for rule breaks KEKW
[2022-12-23 16:48:07] <hhh1980> Can they not do a class two weapons not fully automatic and break if you shoot to many clips through it in short amount of time

[2022-12-23 16:48:16] <+HackTan21> little louder pappa?
[2022-12-23 16:48:38] <boji1029> i like when I see like chawa or someone doing a shitty S+ car, and the interceptor is talking non stop shit to him about getting away lol
[2022-12-23 16:48:42] <luxuschris> bass was proud after shooting Randy. and compared it to when Randy shot bass 1vs8 some days ago.
[2022-12-23 16:48:42] <Baeltox> i understand cops get slightly handicapped in an even fight for having to wear the uniform vs crims wearing whatever, having to identify opponents before they can shoot etc but helping them as much as they do its like were one step away from providing them aimbot level aim assist
[2022-12-23 16:48:57] <poncandom> they running like headless chicken lol
[2022-12-23 16:48:57] <%$b4none> @hutchmf best part about this situation was that only randy and maybe taco got charged , everyone else escaped

[2022-12-23 18:30:26] <+shtondon> the streamers are the advertisers
[2022-12-23 18:30:29] <%+zacst3r> @HutchMF isn't buying prio just for public though?
[2022-12-23 18:30:29] <%+TheMeowstardCat> Server costs are no where near that much to run these servers I run game servers
[2022-12-23 18:30:30] <doofizzdrew> one hand shakes another
[2022-12-23 18:30:34] <%DocNasty1020> koil makes all his money from twitch
[2022-12-23 18:30:35] <Viper_17> @ron_point no
[2022-12-23 18:30:37] <%+TRiiXdt> if you have a "golden ticket" you dont pay right?
[2022-12-23 18:30:40] <+chvz__> Koil is one of the those selfless ppl that hasn’t given back and want the server to succeed and bring new shit for everyone
[2022-12-23 18:30:42] <%+FromThenToThen> definitely get back more than the cost of entry
[2022-12-23 18:30:44] <@^StreamElements> Check out HutchMF's YouTube at: https://youtube.com/c/HutchMF
[2022-12-23 18:30:44] <+lacr3> NP is the platform
[2022-12-23 18:30:45] <+ThatOneGuyDeny> Do you’ll have to pay for prio
[2022-12-23 18:30:47] <%+MrMidas> @zacst3r no you can buy prio for the WL server too
[2022-12-23 18:30:48] <%taraist_> sumsum has more
[2022-12-23 18:30:49] <+Luk3_CX> And also you got to think about server cost every month to keep the server up
[2022-12-23 18:30:49] <Viper_17> @ron_point its ezio
[2022-12-23 18:30:51] <%+thyranno> it's called platform effect, there is no either or
[2022-12-23 18:30:54] <PowerfulTTB> truu
[2022-12-23 18:30:56] <doofizzdrew> everyone does
[2022-12-23 18:30:57] <Cymbello> @ron_point Ezio rped as Stone's dad
[2022-12-23 18:30:58] <+i_am_harvey> Rockstar sued a Lawfirm and won, they are literal Gods
[2022-12-23 18:30:58] <THORSUCKA> the reason nopixel works is because of the exclusivity given by the prio price and the whitelisting..
[2022-12-23 18:31:02] <doofizzdrew> no one gets in for free
[2022-12-23 18:31:13] <doofizzdrew> ^^
[2022-12-23 18:31:13] <looterwins> even summit gets thousands of less viewers off no pixel
[2022-12-23 18:31:13] <phillfirth> @triixdt no one has to pay
[2022-12-23 18:31:14] <@^StreamElements> Hangout with Hutch and his community while he isn't streaming. Join his Discord at: https://discord.gg/UwfzH5vYjr
[2022-12-23 18:31:17] <+Kreamfire> it even effects summit. when he is on no pixel he gets over 20k not on no pixel he gets 10-15k
[2022-12-23 18:31:18] <%+MrMidas> @TRiiXdt correct
[2022-12-23 18:31:18] <%+miwoshhh> its a win-win situation
[2022-12-23 18:31:24] <doofizzdrew> if they didnt do it this way, people would ruin the server
[2022-12-23 18:31:28] <%ToastF4ceKillah> TINSTAAFL
[2022-12-23 18:31:30] <%taraist_> but you hate koil
[2022-12-23 18:31:38] <%$prunken_dotato> 1 doesnt exist without the other...they are both beneficial....gotta pay the people who make things happen too you know
[2022-12-23 18:31:39] <+chvz__> Koil is a man for all ppl
[2022-12-23 18:31:39] <+Floridag218> Shit ZB used to be 5000+ viewers now he’s 500 if that lol
[2022-12-23 18:31:45] <THORSUCKA> if it was easy to get in and didnt need prio it would be every other city with 14 year old terds in it
[2022-12-23 18:31:47] <%thepeskyporker> The server wouldn't be functional if it was cheap
[2022-12-23 18:31:47] <%+iGreffer> whats happening ppl hating on koil?, lets see how many servers are at the same level
[2022-12-23 18:31:48] <+PausGG> @kollectiv people play together because of chemistry not because they're forced to play together big brain LUL
[2022-12-23 18:31:53] <%DocNasty1020> exactly
[2022-12-23 18:31:53] <g33j4y> there has to be a barrier for entry
[2022-12-23 18:31:55] <%+VexedVarianT> sumsum gets likke 30k on NP half that on other games lol
[2022-12-23 18:31:56] VIEWERS: 2 217
[2022-12-23 18:32:07] <+jwmmgd> is that monthly or yearly prio amount
[2022-12-23 18:32:08] <Godisrippin> is prio a one time buy thing?
[2022-12-23 18:32:08] <doofizzdrew> yup
[2022-12-23 18:32:09] <Godisrippin> or montly
[2022-12-23 18:32:15] <@%AyeGavMF> the main server didnt need paid prio though the public servers made 10 fold
[2022-12-23 18:32:19] <doofizzdrew> monthly
[2022-12-23 18:32:30] <+ThatOneGuyDeny> Do all the “big streamers” pay for prio too?
[2022-12-23 18:32:31] <Godisrippin> someone gape my ass
[2022-12-23 18:32:35] <%ca1v> I don't have an issue with NP business model. It works.
[2022-12-23 18:32:37] <%candychintu> koil said he is ending this paid prio
[2022-12-23 18:32:37] <%$darozay> you don't get to just spend $500 and join the server.. pretty sure they still vet u
[2022-12-23 18:32:40] <%taraist_> hutch said he'd pay for my prio
[2022-12-23 18:32:40] <%+MrMidas> people just dont understand that this isnt JUST a video game to most of the people playing on WL, its a potential career and they are willing to invest money into that opportunity
[2022-12-23 18:32:41] <+Mr_GaLiKaNoKu5> ppl just be mad that someone else gets to have fun for a job @HutchMF
[2022-12-23 18:32:45] <+reaperrose98> idk monthly kinda wild
[2022-12-23 18:32:45] <+PausGG> people think everything on no pixel is staged, like u cant possibly be real talking like that @hutchmf
[2022-12-23 18:32:51] <og__op> Hasn't Koil outright stated his whole plan with nopixel is to make as much money as possible? its always peoples choice to play so i dont see the problem
[2022-12-23 18:32:53] <+jFrayErrDay> 500 a month isnt even that bad for the opportunity you are given
[2022-12-23 18:32:53] <+Kreamfire> paying for prio is a business investment and that is how it should be looked at. the community as a whole will vastly change anyone life
[2022-12-23 18:32:54] <%Numbsnacks> yeah I could never afford that right now
[2022-12-23 18:32:55] <doofizzdrew> the only problem here is that someone ripped someone off
[2022-12-23 18:32:59] <knoxylk> Merald deserves better than this.
[2022-12-23 18:33:04] <%$prunken_dotato> just a curious question if dont want to answer I understand....are there some that dont pay for prio based on longevity or stream size?
[2022-12-23 18:33:06] <%savage420blazin> Its like paying for a business license for a software?
[2022-12-23 18:33:08] <IdentityCrysis__> its price has value
[2022-12-23 18:33:15] <+TnC_Chxmpion> @godisrippin u can pay for monthly but Koil or other adims can make it permanent prio
[2022-12-23 18:33:17] <%+Saskasquach> @HutchMF i mean from a business perspective it's like paying rent on a building or a utilities bill
[2022-12-23 18:33:18] <%Scorge_> 500 = 150 subs. most people on the server can afford it and gain more than 150 subs from it
[2022-12-23 18:33:19] <MultiversalMind> absolutely
[2022-12-23 18:33:20] <%+MrMidas> @og__op yeah, nopixel is a business, hes doing what any other business owner would do
[2022-12-23 18:33:23] [Notification] Mickapouel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! [koilSmart]
[2022-12-23 18:33:23] <@^StreamElements> Mickapouel just subscribed for 8 months in a row PogChamp
[2022-12-23 18:33:27] <+reaperrose98> it is a good opportunity but that is alot big risk hopefully big award if you put in the effort
[2022-12-23 18:33:30] <%+Saskasquach> just a business expense really
[2022-12-23 18:33:32] <%Numbsnacks> its only worth it if you can get viwers
[2022-12-23 18:33:33] <+PausGG> @prunken_dotato some ppl get free prio depending on how much work they're putting in
[2022-12-23 18:33:34] <funnynametag> how many people have the top teir  prio on the server?
[2022-12-23 18:33:37] <%Jabberw0cke> well, you don't need to pay for prio
[2022-12-23 18:33:37] <@%AyeGavMF> imagine paying 500 bucks a month to get griefed and put in jail lol
[2022-12-23 18:33:38] <doofizzdrew> you have to be different
[2022-12-23 18:33:39] <%justchillinjay> it is simply an investment in yourself
[2022-12-23 18:33:40] <MultiversalMind> got to be likeable
[2022-12-23 18:33:43] <+SeaJosh> YOu gotta have a character that doesn't suck haha
[2022-12-23 18:33:43] <+GaspaKing> 500 dollars a month?

[2022-12-23 18:34:00] <%$prunken_dotato> @PausGG i would assume people like the admins and such do, so makes sense
[2022-12-23 18:34:01] <awol_lsd> it being a lot of money makes it more healthy.. imagine if it was 50-100? then a LOT more ppl would be buying it and it wouldn't mean anything..
[2022-12-23 18:34:03] <dallyied> Yes
[2022-12-23 18:34:16] <%+RedBeard41318> YEAH 104 GAME
[2022-12-23 18:34:17] <dallyied> He loses some pay for like 50 games though
[2022-12-23 18:34:18] <simbayugen> So if I spend 500 I can get on the server or what
[2022-12-23 18:34:19] <looterwins> 500 amonth honestly sounds about right for prio
[2022-12-23 18:34:23] <+TheWurly> i love watching trevor bauer yt vids
[2022-12-23 18:34:23] <%frenchy_qc> ther is not a second NP so you pay for the exclusivity and the opportunity
[2022-12-23 18:34:24] <%+iGreffer> and i think koil noticed that paid prio make for more ppl to get in the server with no charcter
[2022-12-23 18:34:25] <doofizzdrew> @HutchMF i pulled a Frank Thomas auto the other day. First one of his ive hit.
[2022-12-23 18:34:30] <+ron_point> These admins and devs were pretty much working for free so long let them eat. Why are people pocket watching
[2022-12-23 18:34:36] <@%AyeGavMF> yep he is
[2022-12-23 18:34:38] <%$prunken_dotato> still have to make prio somewhat exclusive too IMO
[2022-12-23 18:34:43] <looterwins> people payed ashes of creation 500 years ago and shits not even out
[2022-12-23 18:34:44] <%ToastF4ceKillah> its a lot on its face, but the fact that people pay for it means that its not unreasonable
[2022-12-23 18:34:44] <@%AyeGavMF> they cut the suspension to 194 games
[2022-12-23 18:34:47] <+fmsttv> how is it balancing nopixel and family time hutch?

[2022-12-23 18:35:02] <+Certified1G> 324 games down to just 194
[2022-12-23 18:35:03] <+Dysotopia> Yes for Public, but you still have to be whitelisted and have a decent character RP to get that
[2022-12-23 18:35:06] <@^StreamElements> anon just tipped $5.00 PogChamp
[2022-12-23 18:35:08] <+GaspaKing> how much it is without prio?
[2022-12-23 18:35:12] <doofizzdrew> do you collect sports cards? @HutchMF

[2022-12-23 18:35:20] <og__op> I honestly dont see why chat cares so much about the price of prio, its not like anyone in chat is paying for it or playing

[2022-12-23 23:05:08] <Commander989> the problem is the fb player freezes constantly and gets set behind. its literally unwatchable its not just "me not wanting to use the platform"
