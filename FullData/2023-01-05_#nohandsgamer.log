[2023-01-05 00:23:14] <%+ucdchris1> denathrius infuse 3 will save the meta
[2023-01-05 00:23:19] <BatrachosHS> at least they learned from shadowjeweler hanar and started him at 4 hp and not 5
[2023-01-05 00:23:33] <caybellHS> hanar was 5? wtfff
[2023-01-05 00:23:38] <caybellHS> thats fucking bullshit lol
[2023-01-05 00:23:43] <caybellHS> i thought he was 4 and then got nerfed to 3
[2023-01-05 00:23:44] <Thiavi> yep it was a 2 mana 1/5
[2023-01-05 00:23:52] <caybellHS> i fucking hated that card so much
[2023-01-05 00:23:56] <caybellHS> was so painful when they dropped it

[2023-01-05 00:33:57] <+lolgary> if he hits 2 to 3 animate dead its lost
[2023-01-05 00:34:02] <+prodigalo> I watched him play this a lot

[2023-01-05 00:34:40] <hokagedohs> til he got 200 armor and the opponent would rather concede than play it out
[2023-01-05 00:34:41] <%+jerry_34_> he can discover amulets from the spell
[2023-01-05 00:34:51] <grimBleeper> @lukawerfstein depends on who you play against, you can do it if you get a lot of meta matchups and play well, i believe in you!
[2023-01-05 00:34:59] <AcezWild> he just takes amulets. eventually he can't trade them when deck is empty, but he can find a bunch before then
[2023-01-05 00:35:12] <+lolgary> nono he can infinite drown if he hits 3 animate deads
[2023-01-05 00:36:00] <%+jerry_34_> @lolgary drown only acts on enemy minions

[2023-01-05 00:37:43] <+prodigalo> i'm not sure there is much you can do in this matchup unless he draws really poorly, it's gotta be wildly unfavored

The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist.
