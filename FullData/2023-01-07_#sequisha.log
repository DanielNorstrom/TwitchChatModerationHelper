Sorry, I know it's a bit out of the blue. In any case ; You've provided much more stability to my psyche than you might think, and I thank you again for that, from the bottom of my heart. I hope everything's going well for you.

But I think its really worth it. I started working like half of the month in home office, besides that i', anyway using that chair pretty often. so a good chair is jsut an important investment, just like a bed. you spend so much time in it and a good one (bed/chair)

[2023-01-07 04:58:58] <%+pi5tolpete> 2 was the farm and 3 was prison

[2023-01-07 04:59:17] <%0assiss> first 3-4 seasons were pretty good, then it kinda started to stall
[2023-01-07 04:59:18] <%+Psycked> Yea after the prison and Glen shit it feelz like it went down
[2023-01-07 04:59:19] <%+cyber_redux> yeah that was interesting
[2023-01-07 04:59:21] <+Shadowfade> Jeffery Dean Morgan
[2023-01-07 04:59:21] <+OlDirtyBC> He was in Watchmen and was good

[2023-01-07 04:59:35] <%texas__smash> The actor was perfect for Neagan
[2023-01-07 04:59:37] <+RandCLR> watchmen is crazy good, the uncut extended version.

[2023-01-07 22:38:32] <+Aviate27> depends on what Blood Token does
[2023-01-07 22:38:36] <%+skuzzo> They make the Blood token, but it gets stronger for them having Blood tokens.
[2023-01-07 22:38:46] <%boosted9946> it's a way to force people to mulligan
[2023-01-07 22:38:50] <%Hitmandan_MN> Are there maybe cards to give that card to your opponent so when they cast you get the blood token?
[2023-01-07 22:38:55] <%incrediblejoker> MTG arena is fun to play online, been a while since I played it
[2023-01-07 22:38:58] <omgroflme> cause some cards require blood tokens sacrifice etc
[2023-01-07 22:39:01] <%Jemalki> i wonder if its because theres a card that is effected by the number of blood tokens controlled by the opponent
[2023-01-07 22:39:03] <%alexobscure> The card is apparently very powerful, so the opponent gets some advantage too.
[2023-01-07 22:39:04] <messhistopheles> Power/toughness is undercosted so that is the drawback
[2023-01-07 22:39:06] <%+eldirtsnake> it has some downside since he's a 5/6 for 4 mana
[2023-01-07 22:39:11] <%+skuzzo> Blood token says "Pay 1, Discard a card: Draw a card."
[2023-01-07 22:39:22] <%boosted9946> so if you're playing commander you can throw politics out by flooding the board with tokens
[2023-01-07 22:39:31] <%+blazeparty630> some cards synergize well with blood tokens

[2023-01-07 22:40:01] <%BertoChromatic> You want them to create blood tokens to make that creature stronger. If they cannot handle the high damage, they can waste their effort on their blood tokens.
