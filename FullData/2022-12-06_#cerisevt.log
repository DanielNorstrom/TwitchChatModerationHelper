[2022-12-06 14:12:57] <fireforx> Oooooh Civ.   Nothin like charging a roman empire with tanks
[2022-12-06 14:13:23] <!%+Galondir> Now i could cut my "lunch break" short by 15 mins and go back and work, but i dont think so. girldmBongocat
[2022-12-06 14:13:23] <+Milkymalk> you kinda make it a science city by building the science district, and more districts per city make each other better

[2022-12-06 14:13:39] <fireforx> I love this game.  Il settle a continent and build cities str8 down the middle, so EVERYONE has to be nice to me. then i nuke em

[2022-12-06 14:13:47] <%TamarynTentagon> I love that aspect about Stellaris tho.  Specialising entire planets feels nice. Especially with the amount of Forge Worlds you need to keep massive military running.
[2022-12-06 14:14:02] <!%behindthissmile> Stellaris is a different beast
[2022-12-06 14:14:11] <%TamarynTentagon> Very much so.

[2022-12-06 14:14:32] <fireforx> stellaris is like Civ, but if civ's tiles had large distances between them, and you could search them before settling them
[2022-12-06 14:14:33] <%$Memil03> AYAYA!
[2022-12-06 14:14:36] <!%$RickAltair> Yaaaaay! yokaiAYAYA
[2022-12-06 14:15:03] <fireforx> Oh hes hot
[2022-12-06 14:15:07] <+Milkymalk> each game of Stellaris goes like this for me: Start Friday afternoon, pause Sunday night, then forget what was going on and restart anew the next time I play it
[2022-12-06 14:15:31] <fireforx> Yes :P

[2022-12-06 14:15:51] <!%+Galondir> yokaiAra
[2022-12-06 14:16:08] <%Gregor2512> or if he sends them
[2022-12-06 14:16:23] <%+Maleqai> man she was giving you some mad side eye
[2022-12-06 14:16:30] <%LoKs22> wat?
[2022-12-06 14:16:35] <+Milkymalk> guys don't eat it
[2022-12-06 14:16:36] <%+JohnnyTightIips> This kind of game makes me wanna play for a couple hours then restart when I have a better idea
[2022-12-06 14:16:55] <%TamarynTentagon> For me the Stellaris loop is: make new interesting species, get bored in 10 or 20 hours, go back to conquering the galaxy with a rapidly breading fanatic xenophobe merchant federation.
[2022-12-06 14:17:01] <MelonFox_> tall = equalize physical differences
[2022-12-06 14:17:02] <%+JohnnyTightIips> Maybe if all men are laying down cos they're dead, they're they same height? or something lol
[2022-12-06 14:17:10] <%Gregor2512> can u open the bit tech screen
[2022-12-06 14:17:10] <!%behindthissmile> lowkey want to recommend Starsector or Endless Space 2, but will save that for another time. for the time being this tengu stays on the planet
[2022-12-06 14:17:16] <Gdammit> give a smol man a gun and he won't feel that smol and defenseless anymore

[2022-12-06 14:17:42] <fireforx> When i get the urge to play stellaris, i play Rimworld instead.  Either way, im gonna be sociopathic.  Atleast with rimworld, it works to my advantage
[2022-12-06 14:18:03] <fireforx> Theres no food issue if your colonists are the food
[2022-12-06 14:18:32] <%Gregor2512> everybody gets that
[2022-12-06 14:18:37] <+Milkymalk> @fireforx wait ... isn't Dwarf Fortress coming out today?
[2022-12-06 14:18:41] <%Gregor2512> first one is 1 player
[2022-12-06 14:18:45] <%Gregor2512> and 2nd is everyone
[2022-12-06 14:18:51] <Gdammit> @fireforx in an hour or less
[2022-12-06 14:19:09] <!%+Galondir> radiantTrash Alright, guess ill be seeing you tomorrow, will see if i can drop in earlier then today. radiantTrash
[2022-12-06 14:19:11] <%TamarynTentagon> Endless Space 2 is a great casual game to help figure out if you are into grand strategy. Just like CIV games. Simple enough to play properly sine day 1, but complex enough to be fun.
[2022-12-06 14:19:16] <fireforx> @fireforx i couldnt get into dwarf fortress, the ascii style never did it for me. There was a mod to make tiles, but it was still nonsense :(

[2022-12-06 14:19:44] <PersonaFreek01> good morning cerise
[2022-12-06 14:19:49] <fireforx> im interestd in teh idea, if only to see how messed up i can make a kingdom
[2022-12-06 14:19:54] <Gdammit> you can even use the mouse now :o
[2022-12-06 14:20:46] <+Milkymalk> @fireforx Don't worry about ASCII, it's a steam version, it will have graphics. Never been bothered by the ASCII though, I will have to fight hard to resist buying it right away ...
[2022-12-06 14:21:12] <+Milkymalk> time to build my tower with walls made of soap

[2022-12-06 14:23:03] <%TamarynTentagon> Dwarf Fortress and RImworld I will continue only watching. I like games where citizens are just numbers and statistics more. Best way to enjoy RimWorld is via Cerise stream.

[2022-12-06 14:24:10] <%+MeetTheScorch> you could use mouse for some things, but you had to navigate the menu through keyboard only
[2022-12-06 14:25:08] <%Gregor2512> distance only matter on how often u can change the trade route
[2022-12-06 14:25:15] <%Gregor2512> u get the rewards every turn
[2022-12-06 14:25:35] VIEWERS: 198
[2022-12-06 14:26:12] <%Gregor2512> trade routes also build roads so u want them sometimes to build roads for u to move trupps faster
[2022-12-06 14:26:36] <Gdammit> I imagine the people playing the ASCII version of Dwarf Fortress like the people in Matrix who look at the screens
[2022-12-06 14:27:07] <MataNui95> The people who cna play ascii dwarf fortress are just built different
[2022-12-06 14:27:29] <MataNui95> I get eye cancer from just looking at it

[2022-12-06 14:32:44] <%TamarynTentagon> Never liked how AI can randomly change opinions, and has huge anti player bias in civ games.

[2022-12-06 14:34:00] <koleracaput> @tamaryntentagon A lot of it has to do with their so called "hidden" character traits that each leader has. You can only get to see them through good relations or espionage, unfortunately.
[2022-12-06 14:34:12] <%Gregor2512> if u press escape u can see it
[2022-12-06 14:34:16] <MataNui95> okay so like prince then. That explains the ai's low military scores
[2022-12-06 14:34:26] <%Gregor2512> yeah its orince
[2022-12-06 14:34:48] <%$Memil03> It seems you have more options in civ then humankind but i would say humankind is prob easier
[2022-12-06 14:34:54] <%+Nashikage> Back at launch you could always count on the horse lady to hate you no matter what you did and declare war every chance she got. You could also count on her to send horses at you, even when you had tanks.
[2022-12-06 14:35:07] <MataNui95> @Memil03 What do you mean by more choices?
[2022-12-06 14:35:26] <MataNui95> @Nashikage Honestly kinda based
[2022-12-06 14:35:27] <PersonaFreek01> it's fine just build a bunch of university get that science up
[2022-12-06 14:35:29] <%+Nashikage> Tomyris was her name
[2022-12-06 14:35:37] <%TamarynTentagon> @koleracaput I know. And I hate it. Last time I enjoyed in espionage was in civ IV. V I play with espionage and world congress disabled, and VI I don't play because you can't disable espionage or congress.

[2022-12-06 14:35:54] <%$Memil03> @MataNui95 Just more stuff in the game while humankind is a bit more simplified so its easier to get into faster. but civ is prob better in the long run with more stuff
[2022-12-06 14:36:40] <%$Memil03> I dont know anything about civ so might be why its so overwhelming for me tho
[2022-12-06 14:36:56] <PersonaFreek01> what was the religion where you get science for faith?
[2022-12-06 14:37:07] <%acer2020> hi Cerise
[2022-12-06 14:37:13] <MataNui95> Im the compleete opposite i've played a lot of civ and found humankind to be a bit obtuse
[2022-12-06 14:37:20] <%Gregor2512> u should rush reaserch techs
[2022-12-06 14:37:35] <MataNui95> you probably have an ai's religion
