[2022-12-07 13:41:27] <PolyAlphanet> I feel Mario 64 had better feeling platforming, where Banjo excels in presentation and puzzle-solving. vividChpeek
[2022-12-07 13:41:28] <BlazeKong64> As much as I like Super Mario 64, it has some scuff to it that was improved in future 3D Mario games, and Banjo-Kazooie has much more charm over Super Mario 64

[2022-12-07 13:41:56] <HyperMetalix> I sadly didn't grow up with N64.  my game of "funny animal friends collecting jigsaw pieces" was Rolo To The Rescue on the MegaDrive
[2022-12-07 13:42:00] <%Dsn_nemesis> Mario 64 was honestly really good.

[2022-12-07 13:42:31] <JilEmma_Reene> I was too contrarian to get behind the hype of super popular games like Mario 64

[2022-12-07 16:05:20] <+Eamil> @Miaz @Miaz in fairness, while Charles Martinet can do some fantastic VA in general (see Skyrim), no one would want to hear his Mario voice as a constantly speaking character. he'd still have to give a different performance than the one people probably expect. but that'd be better than chris pratt playing chris pratt.
