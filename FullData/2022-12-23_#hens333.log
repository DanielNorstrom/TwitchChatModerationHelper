[2022-12-23 16:01:12] <+DrWarpMan> @Hens333 so technically vial is better if the user is insane with it?

[2022-12-23 16:01:41] <%zeenotix> c33 vial is blights most op combo
[2022-12-23 16:01:56] <capripls> bugs every chapter are part of the content tbh, fun game of guessing whats broken before release day
[2022-12-23 16:02:00] <+DrWarpMan> @zeenotix its op but i will stick with crow + vial :D

[2022-12-23 16:02:14] <%+BarelyLive> @zeenotix I played against lillith running that combo... safe to say we lost...
[2022-12-23 16:02:21] <%EvilD34d> @DrWarpMan i feel like you need to be good with blight to get value out of both...but vial probably better for experienced blights lol
[2022-12-23 16:02:50] <%zeenotix> @BarelyLive if you get exit gate outted using it you should just uninstall tbh

[2022-12-23 16:03:07] <+DrWarpMan> was there ever a blight on comp that used shadowborn just for flexing?
[2022-12-23 16:03:20] <@%$Soulaires_> @hens333 are portals normally suboptimal? I find them fun to use and quite helpful in some situations

[2022-12-23 16:04:50] <the_epiceerie> @aWildKoopa depends on the skill of the player, for the experienced blights there are a few far more busted addons than alch ring, but it is definietly better for average ones

[2022-12-23 16:05:57] <%EvilD34d> @aWildKoopa it depends...iri tag is possibly stronger...but ring and crow combo is damn good
[2022-12-23 16:06:03] <beereyy> @the_epiceerie wouldn't it be the exact opposite? like experienced blights are gonna hit most of their rushes unlike average ones which would grant them wayyy more alch ring value

[2022-12-23 16:07:53] <the_epiceerie> @beereyy while alch ring is very good for experienced blights, they often know how to use and abuse the even more busted addons, with eerie tag being a good example. it is much more powerfull one hitting a survivor than 2 hitting them.

[2022-12-23 16:13:24] <Fireheart2k12> omg did he just get dced for a mothers dwelling map?

[2022-12-23 16:53:40] <m1llness> @jayj_legion Oh, I get it you‚Äôre being a dick. My point is, that with infinite coh every injury gets an easy heal. That‚Äôs all. Regardless of when it happen. If you‚Äôve never been spanked by coh then you are not playing good survivors, friend.
[2022-12-23 16:53:41] <turbek10> should i learn looping with or without exhaustion perks ? Hmmge

[2022-12-23 16:54:39] <LegendosM2> this killer meta sucks, change my mind
[2022-12-23 16:54:40] <the_epiceerie> @JayJ_Legion but survivors time are worth far less than the killers, the killer can not apply pressure on them if he is snuffing boons 24/7, but if one person is booning all the time the others can do gens while the killer is going for the boon. the hex perks only need to be removed once, (except for undying but thats obvious), while the boons can be set up infinitely
[2022-12-23 16:54:44] <+TheGoldphish> Im like 300 hours in and right now my prob is when to chase, when to break, and wtf is making me run so slow LUL
[2022-12-23 16:54:51] <mightytwex> I love how wraith is so versatile. feels like you can run everything on him and he'll be decent

[2022-12-23 16:55:07] <JayJ_Legion> @m1llness yh a easy heal even tho if u boon then heal urself takes same time as a self care basically, and coh is a s tier perk but ur actin like its completely broken lol, and okay hens ill stop lol

[2022-12-23 16:56:16] <%+Fliperotchy> i only play wraith with zero add ons or perks because i hate myself. goal is 2k every game. goal usually fails lmao
[2022-12-23 16:56:20] <%knifola> i've been loving stbfl recently, it's so satisfying to use
[2022-12-23 16:56:33] <mightytwex> @tjmnoob actually yes I think there's a video on YouTube for comparison as well
[2022-12-23 16:56:34] <m1llness> @fireheart2k12 I just figured in order to face serious killers multiple times in a row you must‚Äôve escaped multiple games prior. I was hoping that‚Äôs how it works.
[2022-12-23 16:57:00] <%+Fliperotchy> lol he just dead harded on feeling. didnt even look behind
[2022-12-23 16:57:09] <+TheGoldphish> I feel like double iridescent addon wraith is like impossible to lose with.
[2022-12-23 16:57:21] <%zeenotix> @TheGoldphish they are not even his best addons
[2022-12-23 16:57:24] <the_epiceerie> @JayJ_Legion the answer is simple, killers time is more valuable than survivors, and a boon can liteally save the game against a lot of the killers even if its only active for a minute

[2022-12-23 16:57:49] <%knifola> @the_epiceerie take this to DMs if you want to keeo talking about boons

[2022-12-23 16:58:21] <JayJ_Legion> @the_epiceerie takes longer to get rid of totem as survivor and stop tunnel visioning boons
[2022-12-23 16:58:28] <m1llness> @fireheart2k12 your teammates are supposed to protect you from that, and since it‚Äôs the killers best strategy it‚Äôs expected for them to do it.
[2022-12-23 16:58:41] <+TheGoldphish> Can we talk about Ed Boon?  I love Mortal Kombat.  Kappa

[2022-12-23 17:14:01] <%Katie0nCrack> DCing against a billy is like being mad that your winning lottery number doesn't have your favourite number in it

[2022-12-23 17:23:41] <Sir_Zentrix> there is Hex pentimento tho
[2022-12-23 17:23:42] <%oLotll> @goddynko pentimento: but it doesnt repair the hex
[2022-12-23 17:24:02] <+Doncroft> They call him "no gens Hens."
[2022-12-23 17:24:09] <Kenpo_KId> @goddynko Pentimento is a nice plan B, but that's it
[2022-12-23 17:24:11] <goddynko> Because u i have done the blessing but i feels like its just moves the hex to another totem is it correct ?
[2022-12-23 17:24:18] <chelarooo> Who is your favorite killer
[2022-12-23 17:24:27] <%knifola> @goddynko what

[2022-12-23 17:25:32] <devijohanna> @goddynko hex: undying does this, but only once
[2022-12-23 17:25:32] <%oLotll> @goddynko if they have undying yes but if not it gets rid of the hex !

[2022-12-23 17:25:35] <Kenpo_KId> @goddynko The new hex perk constantly changes location everytime its active, so its harder to cleanse than most perks

[2022-12-23 17:26:55] <Kenpo_KId> @prized_1 It makes survivors scream, so you could use it with plaything, they work well together
[2022-12-23 17:26:58] <+Quinndetta> what a nice meg helping you choose the scourge hook
[2022-12-23 17:27:04] <the_epiceerie> @Mrs_Rah Im gonna change that

[2022-12-23 17:27:18] <%knifola> @goddynko probably because you cleansed undying, not the real hex

[2022-12-23 17:30:11] <+Memm> @hens333 genuine question: why is Clown rated as such a low tier killer? his power forces survivors to predrop pallets (even safe ones) or take an M1. if a map has bad tiles wouldn‚Äôt he be great for denying looping?
[2022-12-23 17:30:16] <Sir_Zentrix> so shack is on 6 or 5?

[2022-12-23 18:30:32] <+Memm> to be fair Wesker can be unfun to play against if he tunnels and you‚Äôre affected by the Virus
[2022-12-23 18:30:34] <+Swayz0r5000> I like Wesker, but I don't play him right now out of respect. Far too many people playing him at the moment
[2022-12-23 18:30:34] <beereyy> they want nurses and blights
[2022-12-23 18:30:37] <%+mig_rattlehead> wesker is a homie YesYes but I don't like versing him

[2022-12-23 18:31:18] <+NekoShepherd> @hens333 That mind game at shack, was that just intuition (if she left were you hosed) or something wesker specific you can do?
[2022-12-23 18:31:20] <TheAlmightySteez> hell no, wesker of nurse
[2022-12-23 18:31:20] <+InsolentCrab> has to be bait
[2022-12-23 18:31:21] <Danneren_> his lower tier add-ons are stronger than his higher ones

[2022-12-23 18:31:29] <HeXKonnie> @Hens333 They should give him reduced charge up time for his power, would make him insane
[2022-12-23 18:31:30] <%Mrs_Rah> I would rather face blight or nurse, you die quickly and usually don't get tunnelled straight out like weskers do KEK2
[2022-12-23 18:31:30] <DeSaads2> ohh tysm @sudcicle
[2022-12-23 18:31:35] <@%Ana1661> I like Wesker when they play regularly, when they tunnel you when you're 8% slower it's not that fun KEKW
[2022-12-23 18:31:37] <mightytwex> I'll play Wesker everyday over blight I hate blight
[2022-12-23 18:31:37] <bridgesburntablesturn> i see a lot of the green eggs  w weskers
[2022-12-23 18:31:38] <+RandomScrub2> @Hens333 I'd also rather play against nurse than wesker, He's so unfun to play against.

[2022-12-23 18:32:26] <%Mrs_Rah> @myersmalewife smoke about 20 games against him b2b2b where he tunnels someone out early and camps a 3 gen
[2022-12-23 18:32:27] <+Memm> i like how Wesker giggles everytime he uses power
[2022-12-23 18:32:28] <Danneren_> i think the 8% hindered is too much tho i love facing him cause there is so much interaction with the killer such as mindgames and so on
[2022-12-23 18:32:39] <%Mrs_Rah> surely Clueless @mig_rattlehead
[2022-12-23 18:32:40] <%+hibrrnate> just 4 more gens, winnable
[2022-12-23 18:32:45] <ItsIts> I've seen serious criticism of literally every killer in this entire game
[2022-12-23 18:32:49] <chaserdbd> why not basement hook?

[2022-12-23 18:33:06] <+Memm> getting tunneled and being unable to remove hindered because Wesker is tunneling really is unfun

[2022-12-23 18:33:29] <HeXKonnie> I think wesker is pretty balanced all things considered, he's strong but not broken
[2022-12-23 18:33:37] <%Mrs_Rah> and his m2 fake cooldown is ass
[2022-12-23 18:33:39] <kraut108> I too disliked getting hindered off the hook

[2022-12-23 18:35:55] <kraut108> I think if there's even 1 killer you are not willing to verse you should not queue

[2022-12-23 19:02:08] <+NekoShepherd> If you DC while stuck in a trap it removes the trap from the game so my SWF, 3 of us find traps and dc to make the game easier. ez counter to trapper

[2022-12-23 19:03:13] <mightytwex> it needs to stack. 1 min but it doubles every DC. 2 minutes, then 4, then 8, you get the idea
[2022-12-23 19:03:20] <@%Ana1661> @Alexagon It does
[2022-12-23 19:03:38] <%Katie0nCrack> @CaptainMcGhost yeah! it's a collaboration with the MCU, including thanos in the main cast

[2022-12-23 19:51:05] <%Arcanticrebel> I agree and I play pig so it‚Äôs not about the power of the killer

[2022-12-23 19:52:04] <+roisterdoister_> Knight's visual design is SICK the gameplay is ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-23 20:17:54] <ItsIts> no reason soloq survs shouldn't be able to see other surv's perks
[2022-12-23 20:17:56] <grumblephant> But what can be done?  You can't patch someone being a troll
[2022-12-23 20:17:56] <snufhilate> what changes have they announced?
[2022-12-23 20:17:57] <tehb73> we should atleast be able to see everyones builds

[2022-12-23 20:17:58] <YelloGek> SoloQ action icons seem like a really neat addition. Hope it helps.
[2022-12-23 20:18:01] <xar0pe__> i think if we could ping positions like in overwatch it would prob be enough
[2022-12-23 20:18:04] <+FungiFred> i had a 4 man team group ragequit against me earlier after the second down when they brought three medkits, survivor morale definitely low

[2022-12-23 21:12:01] <grumblephant> I meant more like, every time you swing at a window, he just stands there looking instead of running.
[2022-12-23 21:12:09] <grumblephant> Maybe I'm just a baby

[2022-12-23 21:17:54] <+GoodVibesRav> Nah, I think the differentiation is that the Jeff did the most with what he had; he didn't make every right play, but he just didn't do badly otzShrug
