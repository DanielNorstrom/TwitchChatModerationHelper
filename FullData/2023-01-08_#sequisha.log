[2023-01-08 00:02:26] <@%ForeverAloneHero> like when guitar and bass playing-they are "in tune" already. no pitching required. but for brass instruments there are rules to pitch. like guitar and bass are jamming in C, sax has to play in F

[2023-01-08 00:03:24] <!%+WesKeltner> The early arcade models of Killer Instinct held on the "insert coin" screen for too long. It was a CRT so it burned in. We swapped a lot of CRT's in that machine until they updated the game to show more gameplay faster if you follow.
[2023-01-08 00:03:33] <%+egmbe> remember the donkey kong kill screen @Sequisha

[2023-01-08 03:02:08] <verylonelystream> Kubrick didn't miss
[2023-01-08 03:02:11] <Shublues> I liked the tv-show The Shining alot more than the movie. LUL
[2023-01-08 03:02:12] <Rayyver> I think they could do it again now and it'd be a good adaptation
[2023-01-08 03:02:15] <%ebknight89> the twins were mentioned in the book
[2023-01-08 03:02:18] <%Homicidalson> Love Kubrick

[2023-01-08 03:02:27] <%+lamonster74> you can get Shudder through AMC+ as well, if you want to get a little more with it
[2023-01-08 03:02:27] <+SmkyTheBer> Double check, its one of my favorite books.
[2023-01-08 03:02:27] <shaggyjinxxx> with the right director and producer anything is possible
[2023-01-08 03:02:28] <iamfallfromgrace> The Guillermo Cabinet of Curiosities is a fun watch on Netflix.

[2023-01-08 03:03:08] <%grizto> It’s a Kubrick after all. King might have not been happy at first, but it’s Kubrick, he was a special director
[2023-01-08 03:03:08] <%+Deaths_Favored> @iamfallfromgrace loved it, hope they have a second series
[2023-01-08 03:03:10] <Christianspeer> @sequisha have you seen Terrifier?

[2023-01-08 03:03:46] <+GreatbeardofZeus_> I am on a "Cult" kick. anything involving real life cults. Also, has anyone watched "Don't pick up the phone"?
[2023-01-08 03:03:49] <%itsPuz> I just feel bad for the guy who was on vacation, got shined by danny, crossed country to help and just immediately got chopped
[2023-01-08 03:03:50] <%Flying_Hellfish> the movie is just so good
[2023-01-08 03:03:50] <%Faithlesssoul> @iamfallfromgrace the one from 2006 was good or you talking about the one from 2013
[2023-01-08 03:03:50] <%May_Be_AFK> plus like King brought out this later notion that all of his stories are in the same "universe"
[2023-01-08 03:03:51] <%itsPuz> rough times
[2023-01-08 03:03:51] <+HammeredMonk> I thought the main thing King didn’t like was how the story was inspired about his own struggle with alcoholism and how it hurt his family. The book had a redemption of sorts for Jack at the end while the movie didn’t
[2023-01-08 03:03:51] <%ebknight89> I like the Dark Tower movie. my wife hated it
[2023-01-08 03:03:58] <%+Hariga> dark tower movie was bad..
