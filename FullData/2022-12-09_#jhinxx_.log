[2022-12-09 00:12:23] <Discxnts> True, don't edit for someone you don't like. It'll be so demotivating.
[2022-12-09 00:12:31] <GletscherX> makes full sense u wouldnt have to edit everything
[2022-12-09 00:12:41] <%+MilkyBearTV> pog im finally on for one of your streams again
[2022-12-09 00:12:45] <Yui_VCC> @Discxnts its why i'd never edit for myself Kappa
[2022-12-09 00:12:49] <%Whaive_> That is true! Sometimes I feel that a video is not edited enough... and normally in the end what happends, is that the video becomes overedited!
[2022-12-09 00:13:26] <criyzen> I know nyanners and aethel like come clip channels of their content is all, some of them are a bit edited than others. I reckon you could become an offical editor running a clip channel possibly?

[2022-12-09 00:13:43] <GletscherX> i mean there exists shitposting, so i guess some people like that KEKW
