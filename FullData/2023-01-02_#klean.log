[2023-01-02 00:17:02] <+jse_3> i feel that would be a great change
[2023-01-02 00:17:03] <+metabanger> that would be a great addition
[2023-01-02 00:17:21] <Wheelson105> faceshields should be found in raid only tbh, in the same way high level ammo shud be
[2023-01-02 00:17:28] <Kouken_NZ> would love low-ready just to not point my gun at ingame friendlies faces
[2023-01-02 00:17:32] <@%JaxPC> @Klean idk if you remember when i ranted about my ideal milsim game ages ago, but yeah having low ready and bringing the gun up would be baller
[2023-01-02 00:17:41] <Nawperman> you don't practice combat glide at all times?
[2023-01-02 00:18:09] <hotdogpancakes> have you heard anything about dead matter?
[2023-01-02 00:18:10] <Kindalhart> faceshields are nothing except early wipe or against AI maybe, so why restrict it so harshly
[2023-01-02 00:18:15] <%ForsaikenRedskye> you know... since you can bind actions to the same binds as others... whynot make it so that you turn your laser/flashlight on off as a hold instead while having it bound to RMB... it would be much more tactical that way too
[2023-01-02 00:18:20] <+rasGage> why doesn't klean play the new map?

[2023-01-02 00:18:37] <oni_pepega> @Kouken_NZ yeah so if you want to appear more friendly you don't need to pull the knife out and just lower the weapon, that would be cool
[2023-01-02 00:18:38] <%+ll_DMC_ll> @rasGage Bad performance I think

[2023-01-02 00:19:14] <+rasGage> i see i see. No quests in the new map?
[2023-01-02 00:19:15] <@%JaxPC> @ForsaikenRedskye it would be sick if they added a pressure pad into the game and you use the normal flashlight key to toggle if it activated on RMB
[2023-01-02 00:19:36] <+Baka_Ramy> time to lvl that bolt action skill for me now.... Tarkoooov shooter.....
[2023-01-02 00:19:36] <+Vermillion95> @rasGage Might be but not this early lol
[2023-01-02 00:20:04] <nyaqua_gg> there are quests on new map
[2023-01-02 00:20:04] <hotdogpancakes> @rasGage no there are

[2023-01-02 00:20:49] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @JaxPC i mean you can do that anyway with a hold action for that bound key. i mean you could also do it with a toggle as well for the select attackment.

[2023-01-02 00:21:17] <%ForsaikenRedskye> i might do some testing with that
[2023-01-02 00:21:19] <Majestic_Midget> why is your watch ticking backwards?
[2023-01-02 00:21:28] <Goobtastic> Still strange to me that boxed ammo takes the same space as loose. feel like the box should be 60 single slot
[2023-01-02 00:21:59] <+rapid268> @Klean have you tried the Ash-12 revolver yet?
[2023-01-02 00:22:16] <+cursed_cuervo> @Majestic_Midget  I can't unsee this now, is it upside down?
[2023-01-02 00:22:27] <%ForsaikenRedskye> might be a bit easier to do with a toggle instead actually. monkaHmm

[2023-01-02 01:15:58] <ag_pixel> Meaning many players are lvl 2

[2023-01-02 01:16:12] <Goobtastic> @Klean @TheVixx I just can't play consistently enough and so never feel like i get anywhere.  yep wish things were more craft type than trader/flea
[2023-01-02 01:16:24] <ZethKode> This game be lookin' real good.
[2023-01-02 01:16:26] <%koiks_> your duo is doing setup already??? haha @Klean
[2023-01-02 01:16:28] <+conn_man> What about traders having different items weekly or monthly so rotating shops?
[2023-01-02 01:16:38] <averysadbear> I wish certain ammos/items didnt spawn until x months into the wipe.
[2023-01-02 01:16:41] <SirSnipeys> that smg looks so sick
[2023-01-02 01:16:49] <averysadbear> I was getting blasted through my trooper by BP day 1

[2023-01-02 01:17:16] <%ColeChiIls> @averysadbear thats just bad luck, they didnt craft or buy that. found it in raid
[2023-01-02 01:17:23] <Bspecifik> i think open world and no timers would also keep the game fresh cause a lot more people would die at one time
[2023-01-02 01:17:27] <%ColeChiIls> by that logic troopers shouldnt spawn until x days
[2023-01-02 01:17:37] <Bspecifik> or maybe like a 2-3 hour raid timer where you can traverse maps
[2023-01-02 01:17:41] <%+TheVixx> @Goobtastic Sure, but in a year from now, even irregular play will get you to max vendors / late game, and then you're pretty much in the same wipe cycle as right now.
[2023-01-02 01:17:47] <+rapid268> What level trader is the Sr-2M?
[2023-01-02 01:17:56] <%+Emperor_Ad3ptus> need new anime recommendations. don't say One Piece pls
[2023-01-02 01:17:59] <averysadbear> @ColeChiIls Once is bad luck. I was consitantly dying to BP/BS/55a1 day one.
[2023-01-02 01:18:22] <%+TheVixx> @Goobtastic one way they could do it is severely limit trader item #s, and then create a scarcity of gear that keeps everyone in mid/late game perpetually

[2023-01-02 02:23:10] <PotatoChosen> I like the idea of the gym and the debuff but the floor mopping for me is already back after two days at -6%experience etc. I don't think it's great game design. Feels like rich get richer poor get poorer type of balancing
[2023-01-02 02:23:18] <@%SpottedTango> You know, the best part of the wipe changelog is: - The community will stop asking when Wipe is for 6 Months (Approximate).

[2023-01-02 02:23:59] <+spectakll> It would be cool if each faction had vendors in raid. Kind of setup like Anomaly, a gunsmith commander and doctor
[2023-01-02 02:23:59] <PotatoChosen> Just saying, with flea at 15 I think it makes it harder for people to get into the game if they arent very good or have been eating a lot of shit
[2023-01-02 02:24:02] <@%SpottedTango> @aamef sadly, no. But it should be
[2023-01-02 02:24:17] <+aamef> Most definitely
[2023-01-02 02:24:18] <VLEXA> You can buy Fleece @Klean it's just gone after seconds lol
[2023-01-02 02:24:25] <mofino> level 15 for flea sucks for anyone who doesnt have time
[2023-01-02 02:24:27] <PotatoChosen> Trying to get my friend into the game and its so oppressive he feels like hes never going to become a good player and would rather not try instead
[2023-01-02 02:24:45] <+Wiekuisty> @PotatoChosen I think flea should be at 25. :V

[2023-01-02 02:25:03] <+spectakll> flea st 15 is fine. The game is supposed to be hard. Scav runs are key when struggling
[2023-01-02 02:25:16] <pushbackbetter> the internet ruined gaming
[2023-01-02 02:25:20] VIEWERS: 3¬†078
[2023-01-02 02:25:20] <mofino> no it's not fine, it takes like 20 hours to hit 15
[2023-01-02 02:25:24] <pushbackbetter> tutorial for everything
[2023-01-02 02:25:28] <mofino> probably longer
[2023-01-02 02:25:43] <PotatoChosen> I think flea should be based on something like play time or something instead of level just so the timmys can have a chance if they start playing later
[2023-01-02 02:25:51] <Fourty2> @pushbackbetter dont need to watch it
[2023-01-02 02:25:52] <%+aarondaane> How have the raids been going today? I haven‚Äôt been able to watch.
[2023-01-02 02:26:11] <+Wiekuisty> @PotatoChosen Problem is this is not a game for Timmy
[2023-01-02 02:26:12] <%+BubonicSwag> Probably a lot hArder

[2023-01-02 02:26:32] <mofino> no idea how gear gating new players helps the game
[2023-01-02 02:26:49] <%Borlng> Can't even have big secrets in games anymore, people just data mine. :(
[2023-01-02 02:26:49] <+aamef> @pushbackbetter Not only this, but also crybabies. Difficulty now is nothing like it used to be, if people have to spend an hour or two grinding a mission/quest, they'll drop the game. So devs make it easier and provide hints.
[2023-01-02 02:26:50] <tatari_> The cats outta the bag, no way to go back to how it was.
[2023-01-02 02:26:51] <+og_duhmetreE> there's little turds in your drink
[2023-01-02 02:26:52] <+BloodierMatt> gaming used to be a lot more casual and laid back before social media/youtube/justin.tv the good days
[2023-01-02 02:26:53] <spongey2001_11> what you drinking ?
[2023-01-02 02:26:54] <its_matija> @Wiekuisty but how is someone supposed to get in to the game when the game is wanting to  fuck you from the start , especially with the task keys
[2023-01-02 02:26:57] <+spectakll> Flea shouldnt be a crutch for bad players. its a reward for sticking with it and getting better. The game was fine when we didnt have it.
[2023-01-02 02:26:57] <PotatoChosen> @Wiekuisty everyone was a timmy at some point, I think some of us forget or just had FPS experience, etc

[2023-01-02 02:27:30] <+spectakll> Its supposed to be a hard brutal game. Like games used to be, no hand holding
[2023-01-02 02:27:34] <+Wiekuisty> @PotatoChosen Nope, you are mistaken, "timmy" is an attitude
[2023-01-02 02:27:47] <PotatoChosen> I don't think 10 min queues into being shot in the head for 40 exp is very fun for anyone when they get started, forget the word timmy then
[2023-01-02 02:28:10] <mofino> ^^
[2023-01-02 02:28:10] <spongey2001_11> what you drinking klean?
[2023-01-02 02:28:17] <+Haziri_> Klean thoughts on the Flea being like trader levels where you unlock tiers of the flea and can buy/sell items based on their tier and unlock by leveling?
[2023-01-02 02:28:18] <PotatoChosen> I spent like a month scavving just to get used to the game starting late wipe
[2023-01-02 02:28:23] <vi_o1> What is that gun lmao
[2023-01-02 02:28:35] <spongey2001_11> is it nice?
[2023-01-02 02:28:44] <mofino> then 25 minutes for your scav if you're broke
[2023-01-02 02:28:54] <Rhalgyr> how do you get it? is it like a quest reward or like a loyalty level unlock?

[2023-01-02 02:29:23] <PotatoChosen> I used to play rocket league between scav runs non stop just to keep playing it and grinding my IRL experience with it
[2023-01-02 02:29:36] <vi_o1> That jacket camo looks really cool
[2023-01-02 02:29:38] <mofino> game is designed to hate new players imo, take their money and adios
[2023-01-02 02:29:41] <pushbackbetter> RL the best
[2023-01-02 02:30:02] <%YinYangSparty> does a higher smg skill make much a difference @Klean  i thought the skills barely affect the recoil
[2023-01-02 02:30:09] <%CommancheDan> @mofino it‚Äôs faster if you don‚Äôt scav alone. Invite some random or find someone in the discord.

[2023-01-02 02:30:22] <%+ZachBern> what do you think of the idea of throttling progression, for example weekly level caps, to help preserve the wipe
[2023-01-02 02:30:23] <mofino> CommancheDan that's a little silly tbh
[2023-01-02 02:30:23] <+Nshtyy> cohh is back at it. haha
[2023-01-02 02:30:34] <+spectakll> On a positive note, if you are having trouble, take a break. Change your tactics and reset. It takes time to learn the game. Ive been laying for 5 years and still get owned
[2023-01-02 02:30:35] <%+dess1m> people need to take some responsibility for themselves, youre a fool if you come into a game like tarkov blind and expect to know everything
[2023-01-02 02:30:42] <shaycity1> they are busters for not making private servers

[2023-01-02 02:57:05] <@%Ring> very very based
[2023-01-02 02:57:12] <de_charny> load out or map suggestions? maps are straightforward. for load out it would be like ar, dmr, bolt gun, or armor or no armor. only one category could be selected per raid so that it isn't messing too hard with gameplay

[2023-01-02 03:10:22] <G14__Classified> tarkov is the easiest its ever been imo. 2017 tarkov was way harder
[2023-01-02 03:10:33] <+aamef> @Miltop1G Map awareness isn't really a problem if you play the game for more than a few hours. This could be a low level thing though for sure.

[2023-01-02 03:11:26] <%PotatoChosen> I think this game and souls really makes me question how I learn games vs others and how experience can wildly vary

[2023-01-02 03:11:59] <+Wiekuisty> DS is different. But both games have one thing in common - both are doing everything to force you to quit. ;]
[2023-01-02 03:12:11] <%+DollaDSheets> I dont think you can compare the two can you? Dark souls has patterns to learn, Tarkov does not
[2023-01-02 03:12:21] <Goldie_Gun> souls is a rhythm game once you hit a certain point tbh
[2023-01-02 03:12:28] <%PotatoChosen> DS3 enemy tracking was so mean to strength players, enemies just waited for you to attack to start their faster attack with perfect tracking lmao
[2023-01-02 03:12:33] <%Miltop1G> @Miltop1G yeah it could help my friends apart from that its just a learning curve

[2023-01-02 03:13:32] <%Miltop1G> tho i cant wait for ammo packing animations, thats going to be a nightmare to get every mag animated
[2023-01-02 03:13:37] <%PotatoChosen> @DollaDSheets I think both games aim to teach you hard lessons like cancerous is saying

[2023-01-02 03:14:18] <cancerous_reply> Nothing is more difficult then getting to the top of a competitive game like Valorant or CSGO, or league or dota. The difficulty in games like souls, tarkov, and poe, can be learned progressively, though some take longer
[2023-01-02 03:14:18] <BSDilly> So many better alternatives now and the modding is the more expensive part of the val no?
[2023-01-02 03:14:20] <%PotatoChosen> DS1 basically teaches you how to suicide run with the skeleton graveyard next to start of the game, long first level where you will die 100x before you reach the boss

[2023-01-02 03:16:53] <Agnt_smith> are they trying to attract new players ?
[2023-01-02 03:16:54] <dannybooze> yea they need to slow down the progression
[2023-01-02 03:16:58] <cancerous_reply> WoW time gates certain things to let everyone catch up a bit. But its hard, its Pareto distribution, the top few % will just play a lot more, get ahead and be at an advantage thus getting more advantage. Most things u can try to stop the ones at the top will affect the ones at the bottom
[2023-01-02 03:17:07] <BSDilly> Yeah exactly. This is a worry for me when it comes to dark and darker, i hope the quests and traders dont follow the same suite as tarkov
[2023-01-02 03:17:07] <the_grim_peeper_> Day two with no powerüíÄ
[2023-01-02 03:17:19] <%+DollaDSheets> True, and this is where it changes and the difficulty amps up as players are still unpredictable and don't have to follow the same path

[2023-01-02 03:17:29] <%ForsaikenRedskye> traders being only in raid will make progress be a lot slower
[2023-01-02 03:17:41] <+meer92> @Klean hope you have a great year brother!
[2023-01-02 03:17:46] <%PotatoChosen> My funnest raid this wipe was using every bullet in my 20 round MP5 mags, circling around the ambulance for all the loot of the victims on the ground, getting chased down by player scavs trying to extract and getting out on 100 hp
[2023-01-02 03:18:00] <cancerous_reply> @ForsaikenRedskye progress being slower means slower for everyone, so the difference between top players and bottom players will still exist
[2023-01-02 03:18:05] <Mmaster116> The issue with slowing progression down is that it if you do it in such a way, the players that sweat this game 16 hours a day will still be ahead of normal players

[2023-01-02 03:18:19] <Enfuzed1> Time gating is one of the most horrible game design decisions out there. All it does is discourage people playing your game. @cancerous_reply
[2023-01-02 03:18:24] <BSDilly> @ForsaikenRedskye If they sell the same stuff as they do now and have barters for high tier gear, nothing will change, it will only add a small thin layer which is easily broken for people rushing meta loadouts anyway
[2023-01-02 03:19:04] <%ForsaikenRedskye> you'll also have to upgrade your hideout to even get to flea which makes it even slower.
[2023-01-02 03:19:06] <cancerous_reply> @Enfuzed1 no, if you do it right it just means ppl take 2-3 weeks longer to progress instead of doing it in 1 week.
[2023-01-02 03:19:09] <%+k0dey> anyone know what scav karma klean's at?

[2023-01-02 03:19:41] <%PotatoChosen> What if BSG just designed the wipes to have traders change their offerings as the month changed over so everyone had a consistently slowed experience in specific resources or guns

[2023-01-02 03:19:59] <BSDilly> @Wiekuisty Not true, warframe for example was built on that staple and still holds a massive playerbase
[2023-01-02 03:20:05] <Enfuzed1> @cancerous_reply Absolutely not. If I am going to play a game I dont want all my progression to be artifically halted that is lame.

[2023-01-02 03:26:30] <%+TheAlbinoShow> @aarontxx whoops half-message, if you murder scavs when you are also a scav it decreases your karma and makes queues longer as well, but right now scav queues are crazy for solo
[2023-01-02 03:26:37] <justcarbunkle> My guess its the ability to disassemble weapons and parts in raid, but its just a hunch

[2023-01-02 03:27:09] <Mmaster116> @BSDilly I am aware that it has been like that, because I have played relatively since then. Like Warframe is not a good game to compare to considering that literally everyone I know has stopped playing, and even I have stopped playing the game because of the artificially timegated

[2023-01-02 05:12:37] <+captainrams> did they lower the overweight threshold? I entered a raid at only 21 kg and was overweight?
[2023-01-02 05:12:37] <%wurlo_> hopefully they changed a bit

[2023-01-02 05:13:54] <+aamef> @metal_gear_ocelot It's bugged atm - so no.
[2023-01-02 05:13:56] <%+DarkPrometheus112> @PotatoChosen don't really have to for the most part if you play enough cause you'll slowly just get full of whatnot every raid
[2023-01-02 05:14:02] <%PotatoChosen> If you buy the 5 round shotgun magazine things from jaeger you can insure them for a song and get them back repeatedly and it works out to less money

[2023-01-02 05:14:29] <Sh1nob1M1st> @metal_gear_ocelot lowers frames and other stuff so avoid it
[2023-01-02 05:14:30] <%PotatoChosen> And you can do a full sprint to no stamina from the start of the raid which gives you the most strength

[2023-01-02 05:40:05] <@%SpottedTango> a lot of external mixers have decent enough pre-amps for most entry level openback headphones as well. I recommend and use the Mackie ProFXv3 series! The advantages of a mixer over a basic external DAC is you get both INPUTS and outputs. You can drive high end headphones and mics, as opposed to just headphones @jahale6

[2023-01-02 06:03:59] <+Overcast22> i think a lot of it has to reducing server latency and netcode which in term makes ai more responsive. i dont think they intentionally 'buffed' them. i think the ai are just running better

[2023-01-02 06:35:25] <CranioDraven> Klean I‚Äôve missed you in Tarkov! You introduced me to it when you showed Shroud the basics when he was on Mixer. Been hooked every since

[2023-01-02 06:36:47] <!paigeosity> oh yes
[2023-01-02 06:36:47] <Respect_> @Fade691 it's a mechanism of email server providers. BSG and 99% of companies didn't write their email servers nor do they handle their outbound emails with a tool they wrote. It's a service they pay for, many of which doesn't always work to outlook accounts. I hope that helps.

[2023-01-02 06:38:44] <Respect_> @Fade691 happy new year <3 tbh if you didn't make a gmail and never played EFT, you could just punch your own balls a few times and get generally the same experience
[2023-01-02 06:38:52] <Respect_> cheaper too
[2023-01-02 06:38:56] <spongey2001_11> who you playing with?
[2023-01-02 06:39:07] <@%SpottedTango> @Fade691 this is also because; with outlook having a business focus, their block lists are super strict. They probably block many mail service hosts, especially options open to the russian market.
[2023-01-02 06:39:08] <+NattyMun> Much respect always jsyk, I‚Äôm still just sitting at lvl 4, so most people lvl 15+ have just accomplished more and it‚Äôs bonkers to me üòÖ

[2023-01-02 06:40:04] <CranioDraven> my AEP email through outlook doesn‚Äôt get a lot of emails people try to send us
[2023-01-02 06:40:08] <Respect_> @CranioDraven that sounds like an artisinal ball punching experience though. EFT is more like... A driveby bum punching you... for a while at least
[2023-01-02 06:40:14] <@%SpottedTango> @CranioDraven have you seen the price of EOD?
[2023-01-02 06:40:18] <+Fade691> okj but why cant bsg reach an inbox unless its google?  really your saying only one email provider will work for this game.... look im done i was only asking cause i couldnt figure it out.. i will leave now thank you chat for answering my question sorry i had to bring it tothis streamers stream

[2023-01-02 06:42:24] <@%SpottedTango> @Fade691 it wouldn't exclusively be google. But seeing as any mail provider can just NOT accept emails from a service on a whim, making it exclusively the most popular (and therefore a fairly lenient) service in the world, that is also free; makes a lot of sense to me.

[2023-01-02 19:34:46] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean I've been looking around for a nightbot - spotify "Playlist" integration. Tons of people code for a !song command, but seems like nobody has come up with a way to id playlists. Ideally a !song command would go like (title) in (streamer name)'s (playlist name). Could be worth commission I think.

[2023-01-02 19:39:11] <%KrackinWise313> @Deathscyyth Id say see if you can find any guides for settings where the person is running specs similar to yours & see if that helps

[2023-01-02 19:52:07] <+Witticker> @ColeChiIls  If you have good ammo precision doesnt matter if you hit center mass, 3-4 bullets its done. But shit ammo against anything armor you need to aim for the head.

[2023-01-02 20:04:35] <%KrackinWise313> Thats why everybody rushes end game traders at the start of wipe
[2023-01-02 20:04:43] <%PinkGuy_120> agreed
[2023-01-02 20:04:44] <%+Ragnar_Ironarm> I think lots of ammo shouldn't be acquirable via traders period. maybe turn in for quests and things for unlock mostly hideout related but again it should i think mostly found in raid.

[2023-01-02 20:14:58] <%ColeChiIls> @ColeChiIls Streets is nuts. the amount of players pmc/scav players. Early wipe always has more fights tho it seems cuz less suppressors

[2023-01-02 20:15:30] <sequenta> why r scav load ins so long
[2023-01-02 20:15:38] <ekozaur> this is turning more into Escape From Mars
[2023-01-02 20:15:45] <%+oATLANTICo> You see the new sag micro red dot mount for the Ak family? it's pretty slick
[2023-01-02 20:15:47] <renodemron> the problem is the huge gap between meta stuff and normal stuff and the ease with which you can have item Tiers+
[2023-01-02 20:15:54] <%ColeChiIls> @sequenta cuz more people scaviing then there are raids for them to get into
[2023-01-02 20:15:55] <+Luz5o4> @sequenta too many scavs, not enough raids going on
[2023-01-02 20:16:09] <renodemron> the formula of grind games is to have items blocked from easy acquisition, so anything that is S tier + can't be bought but only created or taken by a specific action, e.g. the best jewels for monster hunter builds cannot be crafted but you have to find them over time hunt after hunt, the best items to craft jewels are physically picked up during the hunt etc. etc.
[2023-01-02 20:16:13] <sequenta> i see :(
[2023-01-02 20:16:33] <%lisdexan> binaural on?

[2023-01-02 20:16:56] <sequenta> i think anton said use binuaural
[2023-01-02 20:17:28] <%ColeChiIls> @renodemron yeah thats what some people want for this game. Imo a T4 should be the highest you get from traders, with T5 being quest reward or rare loot. T6 being rare from bosses and rare material crafting
[2023-01-02 20:17:28] <%BSDilly> maybe a thicker holo would work, think it sits abit higher than that red dot
[2023-01-02 20:17:31] <nosrakt> are there any promo codes for tarkov atm?
[2023-01-02 20:17:53] <%+phergoshop> it might be on sale still not sure
[2023-01-02 20:17:54] <%ColeChiIls> @BSDilly yeah but he needs it closer to his eye to reduce some of the crazy bounce on the front of the gun
[2023-01-02 20:17:56] <+InheritedSight> how's this ak feelin @Klean
[2023-01-02 20:18:05] <renodemron> yeap @ColeChiIls

[2023-01-02 20:19:35] <+Luz5o4> town and suburbs are two separate maps?
[2023-01-02 20:19:40] <+sneezy123> So what is the plan with DLC, those who bought EOD will get them for free or?
[2023-01-02 20:19:49] <%ColeChiIls> @sneezy123 yes
[2023-01-02 20:19:52] <+Luz5o4> @sneezy123 yes, as well as arena

[2023-01-02 20:29:11] <@%+fortburke> The concept of just home defence not even firearms is a foreign concept too
[2023-01-02 20:29:14] <+MadCatMiniatures> And horrific
[2023-01-02 20:29:16] <Wooolfi> im european and i have a gun soooo dont get that commennt LUL
[2023-01-02 20:29:19] <Bucket_Bot> thats why we have wars... /shrug
[2023-01-02 20:29:22] <%Ayomeer> yea not judging, as you said very different
[2023-01-02 20:29:22] <ekozaur> I mean, it's crazy how I live in a country where nobody comes after me in my own home...
[2023-01-02 20:29:22] <KrayZJool> in EU our home defense is locking the door :D
[2023-01-02 20:29:26] <%+KARMERICAN> how much government has dripped in the ear?
[2023-01-02 20:29:32] <+Witticker> Real puzzling thing to me is that we can't defend our home.... let alone use a firearm to do so...
[2023-01-02 20:29:42] <+Witticker> in those countries.
[2023-01-02 20:29:43] <strongbox> the concept of a tv loicense is a foreign concept to me
[2023-01-02 20:29:52] <+MadCatMiniatures> Imagine having to defend your own home by stabbing someone to death, as opposed to clinically inserting a boolet thru their noggin
[2023-01-02 20:29:59] <+Radenlol> jeah, I never thought once in my live how to defend myself. Never had that fear
[2023-01-02 20:29:59] <%+oATLANTICo> 911 one just comes up to pick up the bodies
[2023-01-02 20:30:03] <%+Chill3x3r> we can have firearms in germany, they are just not needed for home defense here, because we don¬¥t have such a fucked up system overall
[2023-01-02 20:30:06] <+MadCatMiniatures> I live in tyhe UK and I WISH we had a health care system atall
[2023-01-02 20:30:11] <sircrocodile165> @Klean yeah in my country cops don't shot me at spot LUL

[2023-01-02 20:30:35] <%ColeChiIls> @Chill3x3r Most Americans dont need it either. Better to have and not need, then need and not have

[2023-01-02 20:30:45] <+Koollectibles> Klean with the clean takes, appreciate it bro
[2023-01-02 20:30:49] <LabMade> militarized police force is quite unique to the US
[2023-01-02 20:30:50] <+Witticker> More training and funding is what we need... not less my dude @sircrocodile165
[2023-01-02 20:30:53] <+MadCatMiniatures> GOD I WISH I'd been paying an insurance company and living in the states

[2023-01-02 20:31:02] <Quixies> in my country the police are running AKM's instead of handguns
[2023-01-02 20:31:10] <%KrackinWise313> Thats actual facts you cant count on the police to save you in the Us imo
[2023-01-02 20:31:10] <eddybig74> @Klean and statistically a wildly inaccurate statement
[2023-01-02 20:31:11] <+ShiruShirudo> @Witticker better, not more. But yes .

[2023-01-02 20:32:33] <%+LeftyJ> neighbors are kinda annoying LUL
[2023-01-02 20:32:36] <%+AshtenTh3Man> My neighbors are college kids so I avoid them
[2023-01-02 20:32:37] <%shavenyeti12> pretty common in the uk
[2023-01-02 20:32:37] <%+DraX_Core> my neighbors have a christmas party everyyear and the whole neighborhood comes over
[2023-01-02 20:32:40] <%+dale0607> That was the first thing I did when I moved to my house was meet the neighbors around me. We watch each others houses when we go on vacation and such. Just southern living
[2023-01-02 20:32:40] <red_eyes_red_eyes> i dont like people so
[2023-01-02 20:32:44] <+ShiruShirudo> @Witticker not American either, if its 6months - thats not long enough .  Should be 1-2 years at least .
[2023-01-02 20:32:44] <nuglife420> maybe here not in all countries
[2023-01-02 20:32:47] <Cortex_Reaver> i've talked to my neighbors but we are not friends
[2023-01-02 20:32:51] <%fig__jam> I know my neighbor because she introduced herself otherwise I wouldn't
[2023-01-02 20:32:52] <%KrackinWise313> My neighbor & I both agree If anyone messes with our stuff or families they are gonna be blasted

[2023-01-02 20:32:57] <Katzbert> I actually know quite a few of my neighbours, we have a bit of a community going on in my building, which is nice
[2023-01-02 20:32:57] <Evolving_Monkey> one of our neighbors is religious cult member, the other one is an escort. we get along just fine
[2023-01-02 20:32:58] <%+benb0mb> I know their names and we exchanged numbers so if we ever have concerns.

[2023-01-02 20:33:07] <%ColeChiIls> @Klean itd be easier if we all lived in RVs and could park next to people we share similar mindsets with
[2023-01-02 20:33:08] <+MadCatMiniatures> I've TRIED talking to my neighbours!  I offered to take their bins out if they're away.  They nod in fear and say yes because I'm pretty sure it's the only English they know
[2023-01-02 20:33:09] <%+TacticoolChopsticks> I live in Bum Fuck Egypt. No neighbors to worry about.
[2023-01-02 20:33:10] <buddhacheesa> I moved too a different spot some time ago. And I was really amazed how this neighborhood is fully connected. They all helped me out and we got a whatsapp group. And they ask me to do stuff sometimes aswell. But I am pretty private. Nonethless thats awesome.
[2023-01-02 20:33:12] <%R07_> I have a job outside of the computer so I have no choice but to talk to people LUL
[2023-01-02 20:33:13] <%Trent_> I know all my neighbors I just don‚Äôt like most of them their annoying af lol

[2023-01-02 20:33:21] <%Boxed_Boxes> my next door neighbor is my aunt and uncle, so i know themlol
[2023-01-02 20:33:30] <Katzbert> Like, my neighbor might ask me for help with her tv and will shove tons of cookies in my hands in return :)
[2023-01-02 20:33:39] <+Witticker> @Witticker I've been told by people in the states that initial entrance is 6month academy and then regular firearms training but its clearly not enough.
[2023-01-02 20:33:42] <%Splint671> Yo Klean how you doing man! How the raids been?
[2023-01-02 20:33:45] <%ColeChiIls> My neighbor invited me to swim in her pool, im good LUL
[2023-01-02 20:33:50] <+MadCatMiniatures> Most of my neighbours don't speak my language.  Literally
[2023-01-02 20:33:54] <%+KushKaBerries> bro my neighbor found me on fb and started messaging me
[2023-01-02 20:34:07] <+Radenlol> @KushKaBerries that seems weird af

[2023-01-02 20:34:34] <+bigworm69_> @witticker Then after the academy you are on a Field Training Program for around 8-12 months. On the job training before you are put by yourself.
[2023-01-02 20:34:38] <buddhacheesa> This is true and I hate it.
[2023-01-02 20:34:41] <+agentcrazydip> I feel like we were heading this way already, but the pandemic expedite it.
[2023-01-02 20:34:43] <+MadCatMiniatures> I miss the 90s
[2023-01-02 20:34:44] <%ColeChiIls> @SimbaYugen trust me I know, went from talking about divorcing her husband to please come swim anytime LUL aiunt talked since
[2023-01-02 20:34:47] <+Witticker> @Klean  that's some anti social behavior brought on by the damn internet... such a great technological feat has ruined our way of living.
[2023-01-02 20:34:49] <eddybig74> @Klean The idea of the metaworld feeds into the dehumanization of today

[2023-01-02 20:35:43] <@%SpottedTango> it's sad to me that MOST people spend the most time with their COWORKERS instead of there families, how times have changed.
[2023-01-02 20:35:47] <%fig__jam> The problem with Police in America is the amount of power given to them by the Courts. All the problems with law enforcement starts in the Courts.
[2023-01-02 20:35:52] <%ColeChiIls> @Blaasram1 best bet is to join Kleans, or any discord and start askin people homie. Im sure someone down to do some questing. If not EFT has official sherpas
[2023-01-02 20:35:59] <+Witticker> @bigworm69_  THat "field training program"... is that just a placeholder name or are they really thrown in the middle of it? Because I have an assumption that more police departments are going to put them in a paper pushing position during that time.
[2023-01-02 20:36:08] <%KrackinWise313> @Blaasram1 Join the discord probably some peeps in there down to play

[2023-01-02 20:36:55] <%BSDilly> @SpottedTango Blood of thy covenenant is thicker than the blood of thy mothers womb, something along those lines. Family is what you make family to be, coworkers or not. Your definition of family is different to someone elses.

[2023-01-02 20:37:34] <buddhacheesa> @fig__jam Also the short training time to become a police officer. It takes alot to be a good cop.
[2023-01-02 20:37:37] <@%SpottedTango> @BSDilly it was more a comment on time allocation; rather than who is your family

[2023-01-02 20:37:53] <+Witticker> @bigworm69_  then in your opinion what is the biggest issue with cops? Crazy people say defund them, Logical (in my opinion) people say we need more funding and training...
[2023-01-02 20:37:55] <@%SpottedTango> @ColeChiIls it's your right

[2023-01-02 20:38:15] <+best_limes> is this the worst wipe yet?
[2023-01-02 20:38:27] <%ColeChiIls> @SpottedTango yes it is. but its not ideal to go out of your way to pester them just to be a nuisance
[2023-01-02 20:38:50] <+bigworm69_> @witticker Absolutely. Funding in the right areas. Defunding is causing massive bleeding within the department. Which leads to hiring poor candidates who are under qualified.
[2023-01-02 20:38:58] <+Witticker> @SimbaYugen  I agree with what you said earlier but you guys signed up for that tough shit... I think there is room to improve a crucial system we all need.

[2023-01-02 20:39:35] <@%SpottedTango> @ColeChiIls nothing inherently pestering about holding a camera on public property, as long as you're following the law and auditing correctly; there is no problem afai am concerned.
[2023-01-02 20:39:41] <+noediherst> @Klean is labs worth going to early? or do you just get shit on?
[2023-01-02 20:39:44] <%BSDilly> Switzerland has very lenient gun laws and yet there is not as many mass shootings or gun killings as there is in america, education is americas biggest gripe, more people need educated on guns in general
[2023-01-02 20:39:52] <+Witticker> @bigworm69_ We have clearly seen some rather dangerous consequences to states and cities where they did defund the police force.... so clearly that is not the answer. i think we need more money in the police force ;P
[2023-01-02 20:39:59] <gamerrprogrezz> guys i cant play streets of tarkov its lagging too much and i get kicket why ?

[2023-01-02 21:03:23] <%Gunning_Wild> just like real life money
[2023-01-02 21:03:24] <%ColeChiIls> the cycle did it right with just cash @Klean
[2023-01-02 21:03:33] <%+panzergorilla23> money would be the best
[2023-01-02 21:03:38] <%+Reaper447> money would make the most sense
[2023-01-02 21:03:40] <%KrackinWise313> Team play kind of encourages abusing insurance too
[2023-01-02 21:03:42] <+GGinTheName> That's a pretty good idea. Would be a lot like real life insurance t hen
[2023-01-02 21:03:42] <+DragonMonkeys> idk, its really expensive and a scavs job is to scavenge the lost gear or PMCs so, if the scavs cant successfully take the gear, then you get it back
[2023-01-02 21:03:48] <+AerithsChaos> Well what would dictate the worth? Value to sell to traders, or market value?
[2023-01-02 21:03:48] <%+AttemptedPants> Iirc the cycle had something like that
[2023-01-02 21:03:49] <%+aarondaane> I think once you hit a certain level or cash value insurance isn‚Äôt an option or something.
[2023-01-02 21:03:49] <%lovetapr> some of my guns get sentimental value whos gonna pay me for that
[2023-01-02 21:03:53] <%BSDilly> I agree. One thing when i started playing that didnt click with me was groups dumping there buddies gear in a bush so in circulates back, basically no penalty to dying.
[2023-01-02 21:04:00] <%+Quanz751> I feel like it should just be random.. Like maybe they find your gear or not.
[2023-01-02 21:04:03] <%Gunning_Wild> make it tiers so tier 1-3 insurence . tier 3 gives you like 25% back but cheap and tier one opposite
[2023-01-02 21:04:05] <UnholyDeathKnown> In the cycle you only get insurance payout if you're wearing the gear
[2023-01-02 21:04:08] <%+aarondaane> I think it‚Äôs good for newer/weaker players.
[2023-01-02 21:04:09] <%Tman2100> gone or actually go to Fence
[2023-01-02 21:04:10] <%Koffiekoekje> The less scav karma you have the more chance they steal it, like that scavbox scam event BSG did
[2023-01-02 21:04:11] <%ColeChiIls> @Klean Money is best, esp if they iron out the economy with end game items
[2023-01-02 21:04:14] <%+Quanz751> Could have hideout modifiers to raise return chance
[2023-01-02 21:04:27] <%+CrowGB> Tried the monocle nvg, contrast is nice but the field of view is soooo narrow
[2023-01-02 21:04:33] <arctic__________> allthough the prices for insurance are quite high most of the time
[2023-01-02 21:04:38] <%Tman2100> #MakeMacFenceWorth
[2023-01-02 21:04:40] <%Tman2100> max*
[2023-01-02 21:04:41] <%bobthemutant> Finding someone's insured items stashed in a bush is super satisfying
[2023-01-02 21:04:43] <HePeeked> I feel replacing the gear with money wont solve that problem.
[2023-01-02 21:05:03] <+AerithsChaos> Rep with traders to get different price tiers of items back
[2023-01-02 21:05:05] <%+Quanz751> I could fuck with that, I agree its a bit cheesy. I try to avoid it because if just seems easy to abuse as you just described

[2023-01-02 21:05:27] <%Gunning_Wild> honestly why would anyone in tarkov lore give back high tier armor and shit that is good shit LUL
[2023-01-02 21:05:33] <%ForsaikenRedskye> i would love no insurance
[2023-01-02 21:05:34] <+BulletJesus13> But then if we are talking real insurance like that, then i f your stuff got "stolen" then you still get money back.
[2023-01-02 21:05:43] <+Radenlol> but how would prapor feed his family?
[2023-01-02 21:06:02] <HePeeked> I like that idea. Insurance is a bit broken in a game like this with all the scenarios you just mentioned.
[2023-01-02 21:06:04] <%+Reaper447> maybe just the value of the stock gun instead
[2023-01-02 21:06:17] <%KrackinWise313> true your character is wearing tac gear with pockets
[2023-01-02 21:06:17] <+mcpw> Just got killed by a dude that got all the way to level 20 hacking lol
[2023-01-02 21:06:19] <%the_one_true_stew> maybe a 1.5x return of what it cost you to insure
[2023-01-02 21:06:25] <+Jindsu> the pockets are outa pocket
[2023-01-02 21:06:27] <+AerithsChaos> What if pocket space was for dif clothing

[2023-01-02 21:06:31] <%ForsaikenRedskye> depending on your clothing you're pockets and stuff would be bigger or smaller
[2023-01-02 21:06:53] <%+Reaper447> that would be amazing
[2023-01-02 21:06:55] <%issasnook> I feel like insurance is more for advanced players. I never expect to lose anything or to get anything back
[2023-01-02 21:06:59] <%Palabrajot> like weather protection if they put in snow
[2023-01-02 21:06:59] <%lovetapr> @mcpw people get kappa while cheating man, just part of the game now i suppose Sadge

[2023-01-02 21:07:17] <%Gunning_Wild> imagine insurence being a gamba. maybe we give you back maybe not LUL so you drop gear but it only gives like 25% chance of actually getting it back
[2023-01-02 21:07:17] <%+AttemptedPants> Two pockets for top, two for bottom, and the sizes of this pockets depends on the type of top/bottom

[2023-01-02 21:47:37] <%TheHighlander8> play with drewski?
[2023-01-02 21:47:42] <xJustPayBacKx> I have honestly been finding most games boring and easy. I love the difficulty and learning curve that Tarkov has. This is my second wipe and I'm more in love with it now then ever.
[2023-01-02 21:47:43] <ConfinedComedy> no rep loss so it wasn't scav
[2023-01-02 21:48:01] <%ColeChiIls> @ConfinedComedy do you get a notice of rep loss in game?
[2023-01-02 21:48:04] <%holyfrenzyoffline> @boogiepopppu if it was he killed other scavs

[2023-01-02 21:48:58] <+Tvhead__> @KrackinWise313 super scummy, not to say their isn't good in the community. Klean is a pretty level headed source of info and opinion
[2023-01-02 21:48:58] <%KrackinWise313> @xJustPayBacKx I think you make a good point, a lot of people myself included are sick of modern games holding your hand so much

[2023-01-02 21:50:13] <%ColeChiIls> @ConfinedComedy nah he has drops on the 4th I think he said
[2023-01-02 21:50:14] <xJustPayBacKx> @xJustPayBacKx I used to be a huge CoD player, but over the years I've started to hate it because it's the same thing all the time. With this game though, every raid is a new experience and a challenge, love it lol
[2023-01-02 21:50:14] <%Cursed4610> @Klean Why AKSU - Assaul rifle? This is PP actualy

[2023-01-02 21:55:23] <+Tvhead__> so killing a player scav that already killed a friendly scav does not hurt your rep?
[2023-01-02 21:55:23] <ConfinedComedy> I would love to see functional bipods be added to the game instead of ergo boosters
[2023-01-02 21:55:30] <%bananafangs> would you guys wanna see any integration between Arena/Raids?

[2023-01-02 21:59:16] <sweeney1> @bananafangs I'm pretty sure arena is gonna be a standalone DLC as well, not everyone will have access to normal tarkov
[2023-01-02 21:59:21] <+Zanzabeak> did they fix glasses glare?
[2023-01-02 21:59:25] <%KrackinWise313> @charlieacton2011 Just because once you have done literally all the quests and stuff like 8+ times that kinda becomes the challenge

[2023-01-02 22:16:59] <tris122> game issue, each time you load onto a map your game gets more laggy
[2023-01-02 22:17:05] <+NavaresFR> I have it off and still see massive memory leaks :/ Like EFT consumming 22GB after not even 2 hours
[2023-01-02 22:17:17] <arrcasis> I think he is talking about the Ram Memory usage of the game , wich leads to some memory leaks that ended up with poor perfomance
[2023-01-02 22:17:39] <ekozaur> @bigassbeaver69 when a game forgets it already stored something it needs in the RAM, and loads it again. And again. And again....

[2023-01-02 22:20:42] <arrcasis> @arrcasis yeah I think too , but that mean lots of work, hope unity devs manage to cope the industry standards and what Tarkov needs

[2023-01-02 22:44:11] <@%SpottedTango> @MrSlapsz it's complicated. process nodes, the smaller they can make the same circuit in the same area. Problem is that it increases thermal density, so it's a balancing act between die size, die density, thermal density, and power consumption and efficiency. The latest 40 series is better than the 30 series by quite a bit, but to get there, power consumption and thermal density went through the roof. Someday they'll figure out how to make the circuit more efficiently.
[2023-01-02 22:44:14] <TheDirtySmok> @MrSlapsz The 40 series PCB is actually quite small it just needed a lot of cooling for the power draw and most of the size comes from the cooler

[2023-01-02 23:10:55] <%ekozaur> @Sove Well, some ear-pro also have sound amplification, and they automatically go to noise supression when a loud bang can be heard. Even my cheapo earpro I use at the range has that
[2023-01-02 23:10:57] <%PinkGuy_120> its where theyre headed
[2023-01-02 23:11:02] <sneulv1> "splinter cell" its like a "separate group" bassically?

[2023-01-02 23:11:45] <+Hardie1247> @ekozaur surely noise suppression is protecting your hearing from gunshots though, not making it louder?

[2023-01-02 23:14:51] <%ekozaur> @Hardie1247 Earpro's have to components, pasive noise supression, given by the cups and the padding and all that. And then active technology, microphones that "listen" to the outside and play it back through drivers in the headphones. When they detect a high DB increase (set threshold, let's say 87db), they do what active noise cancelling headphones do, repeat the sound they heard but as "anti-noise", the reverse of what they heard.

[2023-01-02 23:16:34] <%ekozaur> @Hardie1247 and the reason you want amplification, is you can hear people before you would with your normal hearing. Like I can hear someone scratching their back from 7-8 meters away... But if a "BANG" occurs, the headphones prevent me from blowing my eardrum :D

[2023-01-02 23:19:33] <+Hardie1247> @ekozaur it is really strange tho, I watch tarkov streams and I can barely hear the wind, I load the game up, and sometimes I genuinely dont hear someone walking next to me, or a gunshot from 10 meters away, because the wind audio is louder than it lol
[2023-01-02 23:19:45] <%ekozaur> @Hardie1247 yeah yeah, sorry, I guess I was talking out of my ass. I never played Tarkov and thought the earpro's do that already in-game. Maybe they will add new eapro's that have that feature. And they'll be more expensive

[2023-01-02 23:21:47] <+Hardie1247> I just desperately wish Tarkov had audio closer to what Hunt Showdown has, all the important sounds are extremely accurate in their direction and distance, and all the ambient sounds are much quieter, but still can be used to cover audio up, tarkovs audio has been a mess a long time now

[2023-01-02 23:46:47] <@%Ring> I hope they add shoulder swapping by then
[2023-01-02 23:46:54] <tsiigaaja> @Art_CM apparently the genre is Phonk and the distortion is intended
[2023-01-02 23:46:59] <SimbaYugen> Can‚Äôt play but been enjoying watching and learning hutchmfWiggle
[2023-01-02 23:47:09] <+TheFlyingNuke> When does that come out?

[2023-01-02 23:48:08] <%+k0dey> Big true
[2023-01-02 23:48:36] <ugongetthiswork> people want a wipe just to speed run back to where they were when they stopped playing last wipe
[2023-01-02 23:48:57] <c1sc0kid> my favourite tarkov duo
[2023-01-02 23:49:25] <%+k0dey> People be talking about early wipe like it‚Äôs not 6 days in LUL
[2023-01-02 23:49:31] <+Art_CM> Speed run mindset

[2023-01-02 23:49:46] <ukitheslayer> Hey Chat, Does anyone know when we get punisher part 1? i've done all prapor quests except bunker and don't have it yet.
[2023-01-02 23:49:46] <ugongetthiswork> they wanna skip the journey and be on top of the mountain
[2023-01-02 23:49:55] <SimbaYugen> It‚Äôs about the journey not the destination

[2023-01-02 23:49:59] <+Art_CM> that would be amazing
[2023-01-02 23:50:04] <ugongetthiswork> the fun part is the journey though
[2023-01-02 23:50:05] <%+AttemptedPants> wanna play "the game" so they skip the game KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:50:06] <renodemron> I hope that the wipe doesn't happen anymore since this game has obvious problems regarding the game loop and trying to fix them rather than deleting everything and pretending that they are not there
[2023-01-02 23:50:07] <+Wiekuisty> LOL, usually when I reach endgame I'm bored with Tarkov. :V
[2023-01-02 23:50:12] <tsiigaaja> Imagine tarkov but procedural maps
[2023-01-02 23:50:15] <+PercyRobbins> The age of instant gratification
[2023-01-02 23:50:20] <@%dabsNbrews> i love the handgun battles the most and later game makes them almost impossible FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-02 23:50:23] <+Cajun_Caveman> or nintendo power!!
[2023-01-02 23:50:30] <%+TheVixx> Gaming was always like that when it became online
[2023-01-02 23:50:36] <%+dizzyhippydrake> thats when it felt so cool to discover something like that and show your friends irl
[2023-01-02 23:50:38] <%MrGreyv> I kinda miss not being able to find info on anything KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:50:39] <%Freckles619> the Konami Code Kapp
[2023-01-02 23:50:42] <+xsveninatorx> remember the whole "there's a mew in the truck in pokemon red/blue" KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:50:43] <$tonyzeee> Bro Zelda ocarina of time was so hard back in the day that‚Äôs what made it so good
[2023-01-02 23:50:43] <%ThePebbleGod> Our generation was buying the guide book, I still have the og guide book for skyrim.
[2023-01-02 23:50:45] <The_Murz> had to read it on IGN ninjaaNotes
[2023-01-02 23:50:50] <%+kevsabot> My favourite experience was when I first got into DayZ, we literally knew nothing and everything was terrifying. I was playing like it was metal gear solid lol
[2023-01-02 23:50:51] <+Gunzerkerbandit> Tomb Raider 1 , puzzle galore
[2023-01-02 23:50:55] <ugongetthiswork> instant gratification is an issue with the younger crowd for sure
[2023-01-02 23:51:02] <%+TheVixx> even before then, ppl would buy printed out strategy guides
[2023-01-02 23:51:04] <%$Deezil_Wood> I remember buying the paper books for some games that had the walkthroughs and secrets
[2023-01-02 23:51:07] <Vonkv> GIGACHAD kenshi players not able to rush the game
[2023-01-02 23:51:07] <+Art_CM> @tonyzeee Even BotW was amazing without guides, so much fun
[2023-01-02 23:51:12] <+FMJ_Tiger> Twitch, Youtube, and Reddit ruins gaming. There's always a meta established quickly.
[2023-01-02 23:51:22] <The_Murz> oh yeah, the N64 Zelda guide book
[2023-01-02 23:51:23] <c1sc0kid> imagine tarkov but with procedural quests. so many locations in various maps are so cool but not utilized at all
[2023-01-02 23:51:25] <The_Murz> thicc book
[2023-01-02 23:51:28] <$tonyzeee> Yessir cnt wait for the new one
[2023-01-02 23:51:29] <+Cajun_Caveman> the internet killed gaming
[2023-01-02 23:51:35] <%+TheVixx> I had guides for Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter Nights, D2
[2023-01-02 23:51:42] <+Cajun_Caveman> kinda ironic
[2023-01-02 23:51:47] <%+TheVixx> those paper printouts were awesome
[2023-01-02 23:51:47] <annual_anteater> there should be more randomness in the game, like let the jackets in dorms spawn in random closets every raid
[2023-01-02 23:51:47] <SimbaYugen> Yea meta kills games unfortunately

[2023-01-02 23:59:39] <%iLuminaye> yeah, wasn't my jaw though
[2023-01-02 23:59:52] <%iLuminaye> it gave me some 8/10 wincing pain while swallowing
