[2022-12-30 13:54:26] <@%Lt_Raven> the way rp is talked about these days is like a commodity it drives me mental. there is no denying rp there is no finding some rp. if you are on a rp server roleplay should just be constant and you need to give and take constantly. because just like you everybody else should attempting to live the life of their character. RP is not like seeking out a drop from a mob jesus christ

[2022-12-30 13:55:44] <%Senna_Mynx> the issue with SBS rp is not everyone knows and even if they do it turns serious at some point
[2022-12-30 13:55:44] <%Leviwest> take the rp when you can
[2022-12-30 13:55:45] <@%Lt_Raven> its like describing what you are going to do in a mmo
