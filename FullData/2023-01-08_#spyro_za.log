[2023-01-08 11:14:55] <RaunoSaul> LUL
[2023-01-08 11:15:28] <Ezras> can you merge cam and overlay ?
[2023-01-08 11:15:37] <%+xspectrum7> To be honest Spectrum is not a best idea because of the hot location even if you play klaw if the hot location is left location thats bad for us that means we just have mr fantastic in that scenario and he only provides 2 point for hot location @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 11:15:55] <Ezras> Like Bar
[2023-01-08 11:16:02] <Ezras> *Luke's

[2023-01-08 11:17:05] <sir_deadpoool> iron heart works best for Luke's bar location or maybe black widow
[2023-01-08 11:17:19] <Ezras> professor x also works on bar

[2023-01-08 11:24:50] <BlackStarLightning> Nice new layout Pog
[2023-01-08 11:25:04] <+Jekkfje> you can constantly spam on reveal effects and be cancer
[2023-01-08 11:25:09] <%+xspectrum7> you can hit other players vision with ice man
[2023-01-08 11:25:13] <+Jekkfje> like spam scorpion every turn on Luke's bar
[2023-01-08 11:25:14] <@%Thorax474> Just fix it in peace otherwise it will keep triggering you spyrozaThisIsFine
[2023-01-08 11:25:25] <+Jekkfje> or like yandu to mill
[2023-01-08 11:25:52] <Zentimuz> When your hand is full, Luke’s Bar won’t send a card back to your hand @spyro_za

[2023-01-08 11:26:58] <flubsterittv> Yo
[2023-01-08 11:26:59] <Ezras> is it locked?
[2023-01-08 11:27:05] <Ezras> so it can't be moved

[2023-01-08 11:28:05] <Ezras> curve isn't a issue
[2023-01-08 11:28:10] <+Jekkfje> not really because vision gives you control of Luke's bar
[2023-01-08 11:28:15] <Ezras> you want location flexibility
[2023-01-08 11:28:20] VIEWERS: 68
[2023-01-08 11:28:22] <flubsterittv> I suggest playing armin Zola when u get him
[2023-01-08 11:28:40] <+Jekkfje> kazoo decks are good though squirrel negates Luke's bar so does nightcrawler
[2023-01-08 11:28:46] <Ezras> professor x
[2023-01-08 11:28:51] <BlackStarLightning> Cosmo
[2023-01-08 11:28:53] <Ezras> hobgoblin
[2023-01-08 11:28:59] <flubsterittv> Because it works very well with devil Dino

[2023-01-08 11:29:09] <flubsterittv> Storm is a good alternative
[2023-01-08 11:29:18] <Zentimuz> Angela into Storm is a solid combo
[2023-01-08 11:29:27] <%+xspectrum7> hobgoblin dopesn't work with lukes bar
[2023-01-08 11:29:29] <Gene7ik> i like storm and chavez
[2023-01-08 11:29:43] <Zentimuz> I play Brook in Luke with my Sera Surfer deck <3
[2023-01-08 11:29:43] <Ezras> @xspectrum7 it's not for the bar it's for the other two locations
[2023-01-08 11:29:53] <flubsterittv> I just play storm to get control off the location
[2023-01-08 11:30:00] <%+xspectrum7> storm jessica jones and vision is good for hot location @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 11:30:02] <Crayonfart_> ironman is good in 2 lanes games

[2023-01-08 11:30:25] <Zentimuz> I play Iceman + Storm on T4 curve or Angela into Storm before T4
[2023-01-08 11:30:25] <%shashank0034> YOURMOM2 has a good mana curve HamStare
[2023-01-08 11:30:29] <flubsterittv> Because armin Zola and Dino is a solid combo that spreads out him on 2 locations
[2023-01-08 11:30:34] <pokonek> why noone is streaming gwent anymore?

[2023-01-08 11:30:56] <flubsterittv> Because the game is kinda dead @pokonek
[2023-01-08 11:31:01] <BlackStarLightning> @shashank0034 YOURMOM is good on curve HamStare
[2023-01-08 11:31:14] <%shashank0034> what collection level r u HamStare
[2023-01-08 11:31:21] <%mastersmorc> what is this overlay? you are blocking 2 lanes of cards.
[2023-01-08 11:31:40] <%notlvcatto> @shashank0034 Enough collection level to get wrecked by Mr Negative
[2023-01-08 11:31:42] <Akai_kami> cant see the cards
[2023-01-08 11:32:00] <BlackStarLightning> Can't see all the cards Sadge

[2023-01-08 11:45:46] <quantoll> But you can put her in alot of decks
[2023-01-08 11:45:51] <Zentimuz> Opponent circle is a bit out of the edge @spyro_za
[2023-01-08 11:45:51] <+Martin_Silenus> no point pinning it now, while spyro is still missing a bunch of other cards
[2023-01-08 11:45:59] <BlackStarLightning> Gwont Deadge Sadge
[2023-01-08 11:46:00] <quantoll> She has good value against many popular decks

[2023-01-08 11:46:36] <%+xspectrum7> I'll share which cards you have to get from token shop on discord  Which are meta and best cards @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 11:46:43] <quantoll> You don't have to, i put her in many my decks as a counter and she works perfectly
[2023-01-08 11:46:52] <Ezras> @spyro_za the best value she gets is stealing dinos and Wong and benefitting off his double reveal

[2023-01-08 11:47:48] <+Martin_Silenus> @quantoll but enchantress fills her role fine, it's better to pin cards which allow you to build new decks around them, like patriot or cerebro or wong
[2023-01-08 11:47:49] <BlackStarLightning> He's gonna keep doing it try mr fantastic or jubilee
[2023-01-08 11:47:52] <%+xspectrum7> She is just good in spesific matches @Ezras
[2023-01-08 11:48:17] <quantoll> @Martin_Silenus I mean, spyro has 3k, if i were him, i would buy rogue now
[2023-01-08 11:48:19] <%+xspectrum7> why are we still playing left

[2023-01-08 11:48:52] <Ezras> enchantress just cancels which is fine but stealing with rogue then getting the benefit is better in
[2023-01-08 11:48:52] <%+xspectrum7> Im not saying she is a bad card but she is not the one of the few cards you should get from token shop @Ezras
[2023-01-08 11:49:10] <BlackStarLightning> Lets go
[2023-01-08 11:49:14] <%shashank0034> jubilee right?
[2023-01-08 11:49:24] <BlackStarLightning> Dino passive tho
[2023-01-08 11:49:25] <@%Thorax474> Looks clean, I like it. You can move the board a bit up because your cards are tiny cut off. And opponent isnt in centre. But it works if you dont wanna mald spyrozaLaugh
[2023-01-08 11:49:28] <+Martin_Silenus> @quantoll still better to save I think, Rogue is fun, but I feel she's too non-essential to spend tokens on: bear in mind it takes a month to replenish 1k tokens right now, so you should be kinda prudent with them
[2023-01-08 11:49:33] <%+reryaa> HamStare
[2023-01-08 11:49:44] <Ezras> if he sees sera then obviously get her or aero

[2023-01-08 11:49:47] <BlackStarLightning> Oh no
[2023-01-08 11:49:55] <+Martin_Silenus> Maybe half a month if you play a whole lot
[2023-01-08 11:49:55] <Akai_kami> moon girl blocks ur hand if ur hand is full, cards dont go back from lukes bar @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 11:49:57] <quantoll> @Martin_Silenus Enchantress is good against all-in ongoing decks, like destroyer or spectrum, and i see them rarely this days, most decks built their strategy around one strong ongoing like wong or patriot, and against this decks rogue is way better, but that's just my opinion
[2023-01-08 11:50:03] <BlackStarLightning> Good try tho
[2023-01-08 11:50:13] <%+xspectrum7> I think we shouldn't have played dino left because of the hob goblin @Spyro_ZA

[2023-01-08 11:50:55] <+Martin_Silenus> @quantoll that's true, absolutely, I am not arguing that rogue is not good, just that with how hard tokens are to get, it isn't really worth it to buy her

[2023-01-08 12:14:16] <RaunoSaul> yeah jubilee with hood is bad now LUL
[2023-01-08 12:14:25] <Crayonfart_> @xspectrum7 FAX
[2023-01-08 12:14:34] <quantoll> It's a staple in destroy decks, good with carnage, killmonger and deathlock
[2023-01-08 12:14:45] VIEWERS: 199
[2023-01-08 12:14:47] <Iwilljoy> Aghata has interesting mechanic - she is always in you hand, but she is added card, so at the start you have 5 cards, not 4. Then she always plays herself if she has an energy for it. Also she takes all booster to herself) You can play her with wave - she geives all cards 4 energy cost. Or you can disscard it with Ledy Sif and then play Ghost Rider, but it is a really meme card
[2023-01-08 12:14:52] <%+xspectrum7> storm fish tower
[2023-01-08 12:14:56] <Akai_kami> hood is a great card because you dont need to build a deck around him. you just need to add a carnage or killmonger
[2023-01-08 12:15:10] <%+xspectrum7> your cards will deadke @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 12:15:10] <Crayonfart_> death is staple in destroy deck, hood is okay, but not build around
[2023-01-08 12:15:11] <Akai_kami> thats all you need. killmonger is a meta card now in pool 3 coz of ultron

[2023-01-08 15:04:00] <@theKeYeR> hot locations are healthy - shakes the meta a bit, featured for 48h can sometimes get irritating
[2023-01-08 15:04:12] <DarkGheed> you dont spend money for gold? Without it it took a long time to get all cards or?
[2023-01-08 15:05:18] <@theKeYeR> are you happy with the hood? @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-08 15:05:35] <DarkGheed> i read somewhere you need ~7 months for it (and even not the new cards in pool 4 / 5)
