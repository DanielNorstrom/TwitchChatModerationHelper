[2023-01-10 06:15:22] <%Quantum_TTV> What Are Pok√©mon VMAX? Pok√©mon VMAX are a type of Rule Box Pok√©mon card that represent Dynamax and Gigantamax Pok√©mon. The Dynamax power found in the Sword & Shield games grew Pok√©mon to gigantic size and give them a similar-sized power boost to take on the strongest Pok√©mon in the region.

[2023-01-10 06:36:18] <@%Tazny> @zeddtinn It completely depends on the state of the game, but my general pointer is to always ask yourself and assess "what do I have to gain from trading?"

[2023-01-10 07:49:05] <%talrielz> its just a full art type cosmetic
[2023-01-10 07:49:05] <@%gesticulate> gray cards are just a visual bug
[2023-01-10 07:49:13] <@%gesticulate> well, the bug was on purpose but it's putrid

[2023-01-10 07:49:30] <%speculadora> I kinda think the gray cards are look like poo
[2023-01-10 07:49:32] <@%corruptzelda> I think the borders look nice tbh but the black and white card art isn't good

[2023-01-10 12:09:16] <!%Cripalis> 40%
[2023-01-10 12:09:53] <fitzgamer> I think the move order is the order of the location as in starting on first row, as opposed to order of original play
[2023-01-10 12:10:25] <!%Ellyon> I only play this when I'm on the toilet. I don't think I'm doing too well on ladder

[2023-01-10 12:14:46] <fitzgamer> Silver surfer feels a little bit strong. Most other synergy bufs are +2 not +3. So hard to compete when he can push 15 power with just brood in a lane
