[2023-01-10 06:15:22] <%Quantum_TTV> What Are Pokémon VMAX? Pokémon VMAX are a type of Rule Box Pokémon card that represent Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. The Dynamax power found in the Sword & Shield games grew Pokémon to gigantic size and give them a similar-sized power boost to take on the strongest Pokémon in the region.

[2023-01-10 06:36:18] <@%Tazny> @zeddtinn It completely depends on the state of the game, but my general pointer is to always ask yourself and assess "what do I have to gain from trading?"

[2023-01-10 07:12:35] <%Synastar> “A gimmick? A publicity stunt? That’s what many thought of the 3-point line when the NBA adopted it for the 1979-80 season.”     “Five years after its inception, NBA teams were only averaging 2.4 three-point attempts (3PA) per game. This past season, James Harden alone averaged ten. Teams averaged 29.”
