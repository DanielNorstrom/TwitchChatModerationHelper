[2023-01-03 06:31:22] <butwhenwilltheylearn> Hi dodger I have always had a preference for NaM girls like yourself but god damn you are a different breed! I went to NaM a year ago. I loved the culture. Would you like to go on a date with me..? I could pick you up and we could have a pho date and maybe visit a Hennessey bar afterwards! Forgive me if this is too much but you are too đẹp!

[2023-01-03 09:38:53] <%catperson39> Daph is similar to Hasan, unfortunately. Yeah she is cute, smart and amazing in all aspects , but perhaps i should stop living a dream of thinking that Daph is this shy, kind and a loving person. She changed over time, for worse. She can be rude to other people as well in many of her videos, being rude to strangers included. Ever since her and *** broke up she hasn't been fixed. At least not entirely . I hate to say this but i want the old and kind girl called Hentai artist Daph back.

[2023-01-03 12:13:27] <%+imsodry> most games thats coming out has been in long production for awhile too
[2023-01-03 12:13:31] <%Capownz> most the time these games are just bloated with "what if we do this, what if we do this, what if we do this" and next thing you know its basically been rebooted internally 5 times and 3 years in you have nothing to show

[2023-01-03 12:13:54] <%Capownz> then they crunch like crazy to get the game out in the last 2/3 years and people are like BUT THEY WORKED A DECADE ON THIS GAME
[2023-01-03 12:14:08] <%TheCovidDodger69> that's literally cyberpunk from what I heard lacOMEGA

[2023-01-03 12:14:30] <%Capownz> though to be fair they did get witcher 3 out in that time so its not like they sat on their hands for all that time
[2023-01-03 12:14:45] <coughee> BogU art
[2023-01-03 12:14:51] <%Capownz> they just didn't end up making anything interesting in those 4 years of pre-production

[2023-01-03 12:14:51] <%TheCovidDodger69> never forget people hyped Cyberpunk like it was the 2nd coming of Christ

[2023-01-03 12:15:53] <%Capownz> like trying to make a open world city game with rpg systems and that graphical fidelity and all those mechanics for a first time studio in almost all that stuff
[2023-01-03 12:16:09] <%Capownz> not even rockstar tries to do all that at once
[2023-01-03 12:16:57] <%TheCovidDodger69> they probably shouldn't have started marketting the game in 2012 tbf
[2023-01-03 12:17:05] <%FeedMyPets> yo thats a sick art

[2023-01-03 14:50:02] <%HellaZach> mah_teo yeah the problem is even if there are bike lanes lots of roads are made for fast car traffic and multiple lanes so it's really dangerous even with a bike lane
[2023-01-03 14:50:15] <%Tiny_Mario> what if bike lane separated
[2023-01-03 14:50:34] <%Lumiinos1ty> bike lane separated by a white line
[2023-01-03 14:50:42] <%Tiny_Mario> no by like a little bit of grass or smth
[2023-01-03 14:50:49] <%mah_teo> for sure zach, depends on where you are as well.  around me are lots of bike trails and paths but thats near a major city
[2023-01-03 14:50:59] <%HellaZach> that would be nice if they could make a completely seperated bike path
[2023-01-03 14:51:12] <%mah_teo> wish we had the separate ones like I saw in germany
[2023-01-03 14:51:15] <0xSNIKITURTUL> bike lanes need bollards at the very least for protection

[2023-01-03 14:51:41] <%mergenaug> they will just park in bike lanes

[2023-01-03 23:56:47] <RohKes> cold turkey after 2 packs a month sounds rough, has she tried vaping?
[2023-01-03 23:56:53] <RohKes> or gum or patches
[2023-01-03 23:57:04] <RohKes> a day*
[2023-01-03 23:57:12] <%xMarsipan> shes vaping
[2023-01-03 23:57:27] <RohKes> hmm
[2023-01-03 23:57:27] <%xMarsipan> but idk, cold turkey might be a bit too much probably, if its even the issue here
[2023-01-03 23:57:40] <%+AlexPotion> does cold turkey mean u stop entirely and suddenly
[2023-01-03 23:57:42] <%mah_teo> kinda doubt it is the issue
[2023-01-03 23:57:45] <%mah_teo> yeah alex
[2023-01-03 23:57:47] <%+AlexPotion> o
[2023-01-03 23:57:48] <RohKes> idk i used to smoke and quit and know a lot of people that did, i dont think that makes you throw up
[2023-01-03 23:57:49] <%xMarsipan> yeah
[2023-01-03 23:57:59] <%+noemii> i saw a tiktok today of someone who vaped so much his heart became smaller and now has trouble breathing monkaW
[2023-01-03 23:58:01] <%mah_teo> i quit as well and did not experience anything like that
[2023-01-03 23:58:03] <%mah_teo> cold turkey
[2023-01-03 23:58:08] <%Livida_> yeah going cold turkey is a bad idea
[2023-01-03 23:58:15] <RohKes> still smoke when drinking ReeferSad
[2023-01-03 23:58:30] <%xMarsipan> i tried going cold turkey with sugar and that shit straight up gave me headaches every time i tried KEKW
[2023-01-03 23:58:32] <%mah_teo> drinking was my biggest obstacle
[2023-01-03 23:58:34] <%UnclearNeo> my gramps quit alcohol started to see the angels, he was an atheist KEKW
[2023-01-03 23:58:40] <%mah_teo> drinking then smoking that is
[2023-01-03 23:58:53] <%xMarsipan> she used to do both
[2023-01-03 23:58:53] <RohKes> bruh an old fashioned with a cig Kreygasm
[2023-01-03 23:58:55] <%Tiny_Mario> isnt it the case for some substances where quitting cold turkey can be fatal
