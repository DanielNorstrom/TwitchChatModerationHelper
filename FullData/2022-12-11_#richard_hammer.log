[2022-12-11 04:35:43] <%AOnceWiseSage> couldnt they just use 'agreeable' instead?
[2022-12-11 04:36:36] <$Negarretep> Ah yes, I remember that one time I got caught in the rain and it gave me a lifetime of anxiety

[2022-12-11 04:46:52] <@Shiverwarp> Bany'all
[2022-12-11 04:47:25] <+ThatSl1me> those dwarves better appreciate that waterfall shit you came up with yesterday
[2022-12-11 04:47:53] <+k_nord> that is an impressive waterfall, cool build too :)
[2022-12-11 04:48:11] <@Shiverwarp> If I lived in this fortress, I'd be impressed
[2022-12-11 04:49:01] <@Shiverwarp> Honestly I'd probably have already died tripping over a cat on this stairwell
[2022-12-11 04:51:09] <+Rufish> dwarves only wear plate armor...
[2022-12-11 04:52:19] <@Shiverwarp> Silk sock? Would that be comfortable?
[2022-12-11 04:52:21] <@Shiverwarp> Sounds slippery
[2022-12-11 04:52:46] <@Shiverwarp> We have the same feet
[2022-12-11 04:52:52] <+Nyamses> How good is silk at absorbing sweat?
[2022-12-11 04:53:17] <+Rufish> I have neuropathy  so my feet are both in a constant state of numbness and pain
[2022-12-11 04:53:30] <+Nyamses> Nope, cotton only LUL I've tried some silk sheets before, felt slippery and weird
[2022-12-11 04:53:46] <+Rufish> neuropathy is never death
[2022-12-11 04:53:51] <+Rufish> nerve*
[2022-12-11 04:54:27] <+ThatSl1me> how do you make regular iron bars?
[2022-12-11 04:54:49] <+Rufish> yeah the pain I feel is a burning pain from my dead nerves but I can break a toe and never know it cause I do not feel pain that way

[2022-12-11 04:55:15] <+Plasmier2K> theres a tab that tells you what the rocks yield
[2022-12-11 04:55:20] <+ThatSl1me> ohh I see now thanks thats super helpful
[2022-12-11 04:55:31] <+Plasmier2K> or what they are used to craft
[2022-12-11 04:55:52] <+Plasmier2K> its near the same tab as kitchen ingredients i think
[2022-12-11 04:55:57] <+viizraht> hey, no slandering what used to be the only magma-safe rock
[2022-12-11 04:56:11] <+ThatSl1me> its in labor

[2022-12-11 04:56:24] <+Nyamses> Labor, Stone Use?
[2022-12-11 04:57:10] <%hottiefruits> speaking of new things in the ui, did you know there's a bunch of extra options when you click the right arrow in the mining menu?
[2022-12-11 04:57:12] <+Rufish> I think this game is too much for my monkey brain
[2022-12-11 04:57:36] <+viizraht> all of them. It's a codex, basically
[2022-12-11 04:58:17] <+Plasmier2K> adamantite isnt on there, due to reasons
[2022-12-11 04:58:31] <+viizraht> well reality doesn't have as many metals as we'd like either, so
[2022-12-11 04:59:07] <LungaFermata> I mean they could make bauxite a source of aluminium any day just to make you feel bad for dissing it
[2022-12-11 05:01:19] <@Shiverwarp> Oh did you figure out how planting works then?
[2022-12-11 05:02:01] <@Shiverwarp> Ahh, just isn't a different picture for it?

[2022-12-11 05:17:34] <%AOnceWiseSage> thats some strong melancholy
[2022-12-11 05:18:10] <+ForgottenReaper> The worst thing a dwarf can do is go sober because there’s nothing to drink other than alcohol and they’ll just choose death ☠️
[2022-12-11 05:19:04] <+ForgottenReaper> Is this still the roc colony?
[2022-12-11 05:19:07] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Was there a colony between this one and the tutorial one?

[2022-12-11 05:19:22] <%$templarofflame> apparent;y dwarf fortress used to have a thing in it, where cats kept dieing it took a while for the devs to figure out it was a mess up on the calculation of how much liquid cats absorbed
[2022-12-11 05:19:24] <%$templarofflame> walking over something
[2022-12-11 05:19:29] <+ForgottenReaper> Aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2022-12-11 05:19:37] <%$templarofflame> so when they walked over beer, it calculated them as eating a whole keg of ale or something
[2022-12-11 05:19:42] <%$templarofflame> and dieing of alcohol posioning
[2022-12-11 05:20:07] <+ForgottenReaper> Yeah they’d absorb a tonne of beer, lick their paws, get cirrhosis and die
[2022-12-11 05:20:33] <+ForgottenReaper> So no cat would live more than 6 months
[2022-12-11 05:21:59] <Sorefist> what are cats for

[2022-12-11 05:22:22] <%$templarofflame> do cats give nuzzles in this game
[2022-12-11 05:22:33] <smilingowl> they kill vermin i think
[2022-12-11 05:23:10] <smilingowl> i would have thought cat dwarfs through elective breeding would be alkoholic resistant
[2022-12-11 05:23:44] <Sorefist> cat dwarfs or dwarf cats

[2022-12-11 05:29:40] <!%Calastigro> are dwarf babies big or small
[2022-12-11 05:29:50] <%SpadesOmega> do dwarf babies have beards?
[2022-12-11 05:29:55] <%Anandil> like a ball i'd imagine
[2022-12-11 05:29:57] <+ThatSl1me> they do lol
[2022-12-11 05:30:10] <!%Calastigro> i mean, relatively tho
[2022-12-11 05:30:19] <!%Calastigro> do they come out human baby sized
[2022-12-11 05:30:50] <smilingowl> i like my dwarfs from the pratchett books, where woman too have beards and mating is an awkward probing to find the other gender
[2022-12-11 05:30:54] <!%Calastigro> see, i kinda think dwarves would have thicc babies
[2022-12-11 05:31:00] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Dwarfs are short but wide.
[2022-12-11 05:31:11] <%+Aretor> hows the fort treating ya?
[2022-12-11 05:31:13] <mack_eye> if dwarf babies have beards and dwarf women do not, does that mean dwarf girls lose their beards as they grow up?
[2022-12-11 05:31:28] <Sorefist> yes
[2022-12-11 05:31:41] <!%Calastigro> dwarf puberty, when girls lose their beards

[2022-12-11 05:56:05] <!%RevBanger> yea
[2022-12-11 05:56:08] <Dadburry> windows defender is good enough
[2022-12-11 05:56:08] <Mendan> nah, windows defender is usually good enough
[2022-12-11 05:56:08] <+ThatSl1me> does windows defender count?
[2022-12-11 05:56:08] <%ChessBobPhil> Antiviruses are viruses
[2022-12-11 05:56:10] <+parallax1s> windows has had a decent built-in one for years now
[2022-12-11 05:56:12] <trashpandab3ar> nope
[2022-12-11 05:56:14] <%+CoolBoogie> No. Windows defender does a good enough job.
[2022-12-11 05:56:16] <%Kardmager> I use kaspersky but I get it free
[2022-12-11 05:56:19] <e_gavin> :)
[2022-12-11 05:56:23] <voidnn> yes... but I understand that Defender has gotten good
[2022-12-11 05:56:23] <%hottiefruits> just don't download viruses 4Head
[2022-12-11 05:56:23] <smilingowl> i once read that windows defender was under the top 10 so i just activated that
[2022-12-11 05:56:24] <+DoubleNutz> windows defender works jsut fine these days if you dont do dumb shit
[2022-12-11 05:56:24] <+morinoak> Window defender is good enough
[2022-12-11 05:56:25] <%DrTaru> I just use the builtin windows defender AV and make sure its on
[2022-12-11 05:56:30] <trashpandab3ar> just don't go to dumb places and download dumb things
[2022-12-11 05:56:31] <+moldy_fuzz> windows defender is AV tho
[2022-12-11 05:56:33] <e_gavin> I’m listing
[2022-12-11 05:56:44] <+parallax1s> he doesn't pay for like Norton or some shit does he? lol
[2022-12-11 05:56:50] [Notification] Calastigro gifted a Tier 1 sub to e_gavin! They have given 583 Gift Subs in the channel! e_gavin has subscribed for 4 months!
[2022-12-11 05:56:52] <%+MrZev> lol i had a friend ask me this yesterday.
[2022-12-11 05:56:53] <%$eSaltcracker> you know a big part of why they exist is because of how windows works in the first place
[2022-12-11 05:57:04] <FacelessGuy> LUL
[2022-12-11 05:57:08] <+moldy_fuzz> AV exists for compliance and liability reasons at large corporations
[2022-12-11 05:57:11] <%e_gavin> Webroot for like years …
[2022-12-11 05:57:13] <Mendan> I'll scan with malware bytes every so often
[2022-12-11 05:57:19] <voidnn> Yeah don't download shit, don't do sketchy torrents, ect
[2022-12-11 05:57:24] <voidnn> don't get free music
[2022-12-11 05:57:25] <%Kardmager> Porn is for the iPad
[2022-12-11 05:57:38] <smilingowl> i make a clean sweep now and then, but i usually find nothing
[2022-12-11 05:57:41] <%$eSaltcracker> linux
[2022-12-11 05:57:42] <+parallax1s> microsoft bought an AV company years ago and rolled it into windows and has improved it since
[2022-12-11 05:57:48] <%$eSaltcracker> they are based on linux
[2022-12-11 05:58:00] <+parallax1s> adblockers fix most of that too
[2022-12-11 05:58:01] <!%Calastigro> @eSaltcracker unix, at least
[2022-12-11 05:58:09] <+parallax1s> or just run linux yeah
[2022-12-11 05:58:26] <smilingowl> adblocker and high security levels on the browser
[2022-12-11 05:58:28] <voidnn> yeah ad block. go firefox 2023.
[2022-12-11 05:58:31] <%e_gavin> Im married - porn is all on the phone locked in a closet with the radio full blast
[2022-12-11 05:58:38] <!%Calastigro> hey kid, i'm a computer
[2022-12-11 05:58:40] <!%Calastigro> stop all the downloading
[2022-12-11 05:58:52] <%Kardmager> I feel like bigger companies and banks found it’s more beneficial to help get rid of viruses because it causes them more work
[2022-12-11 05:59:09] <+Antonius_Hubertus> hcjGuys evening folks
[2022-12-11 05:59:23] <%DannyLockard> jerking off in the the bathroom is just what i do lmfao.
[2022-12-11 05:59:36] <trashpandab3ar> In corperate settings it's definitely worth the cost
[2022-12-11 05:59:36] <%$templarofflame> avast antivirus was usually pretty good for me
[2022-12-11 05:59:39] <Al_Kappaccino> malwarebytes and superantispyware used to be good
[2022-12-11 05:59:41] <%$templarofflame> before it got bought by avg
[2022-12-11 05:59:42] <trashpandab3ar> omg limewire. Haven't heard that name in a while
[2022-12-11 05:59:48] <+k_nord> "good" not really. but they were needed
[2022-12-11 05:59:51] <Mendan> when people didn't know not to click dumb stuff they were
[2022-12-11 05:59:56] <@%BranLan> When I worked at a repair store most of the computers that were riddled with viruses riddled computers had anti virus.
[2022-12-11 05:59:56] <%e_gavin> Yah I just run steam, battlenet, x box app … discord… about it
[2022-12-11 06:00:19] <%+DingoEatingFuzz> things like notarizing binaries and windows prompting to launch unknown executables has done more than antivirus ever did
[2022-12-11 06:00:23] <+Nyamses> Windows Defender is enough for most people that don't go clicking suspicious stuff. Never had a virus myself
[2022-12-11 06:00:33] <Al_Kappaccino> i worked at a computer shop that only ran malwarebytes and superantispyware for people who paid to get viruses removed lol
[2022-12-11 06:00:43] <Al_Kappaccino> it worked fine
[2022-12-11 06:00:44] <@%BranLan> ^^^^
[2022-12-11 06:01:01] <%Kardmager> The last “virus” I had was whatever software razer wants you to install to run its stuff
[2022-12-11 06:01:21] <+DoubleNutz> windows media creation tool
[2022-12-11 06:01:29] <+ForgottenReaper> Razer synapse is actual malware
[2022-12-11 06:01:32] <%e_gavin> Yah getting emails even about renewal- it tried to auto renew
[2022-12-11 06:01:37] <+ForgottenReaper> It never leaves
[2022-12-11 06:02:09] <voidnn> I didn't punch my AV in the face cause it looked like Hamer

[2022-12-11 06:02:21] <!%Ellieanna> #ReaperRocks
[2022-12-11 06:02:24] <+ForgottenReaper> You uninstall it 32 times and don’t use a razer product for 3 years and you’ll boot your pc and it’ll say synapse needs an update
[2022-12-11 06:02:25] <%$templarofflame> win defender hasnt interfered with shit i play
[2022-12-11 06:02:28] <%e_gavin> Ty : ).   All
[2022-12-11 06:02:30] <%SkyLineAce> I haven't gotten a virus in over 10 years, and only use the windows defender nowadays, so yeah

[2022-12-11 06:02:40] <!%Ellieanna> Is this gavin fisherman gavin?
[2022-12-11 06:02:50] <+Nyamses> Defender a while back wanted to quarantine the launcher I used for CDDA. Was about the only issue I remember
[2022-12-11 06:02:51] <%e_gavin> It is
[2022-12-11 06:02:56] <trashpandab3ar> I mean the worst thing Windows defender does is block a program or game and you just click the pop-up to allow it instead
[2022-12-11 06:03:00] <Crajabzul> Hamachi?
[2022-12-11 06:03:00] <%+MrZev> lan?

[2022-12-11 06:04:55] <+ForgottenReaper> Didn’t get enough Dick @thruxed
[2022-12-11 06:04:58] <$Thruxed> my 1 pissed dwarf was because he was attacked by an eagle and later his daughter was killed by the very same eagle

[2022-12-11 06:06:32] <Tpocket> I'm glad you did the waterfall project, that was a goal of mine in a previous game as well
[2022-12-11 06:06:35] <+ForgottenReaper> My angry guy is an orphan who came to my place, made no friends and had no family, and his needs were “I have no friends and family” the wholeass time
[2022-12-11 06:06:52] <+ForgottenReaper> I can’t make you make friends jerk off
[2022-12-11 06:07:22] <+bossdevildogg> Nope mixed him in with the food
[2022-12-11 06:07:49] <%Kardmager> I hope the investigator is dragging his corpse around asking if they recognize him
[2022-12-11 06:07:49] <+ForgottenReaper> I put him in the barracks hoping on the off chance hanging out with the same 9 people constantly means they become friends by proxy
[2022-12-11 06:08:54] <+ForgottenReaper> cirISee

[2022-12-11 06:10:32] <$Thruxed> he will never become a mummy there
[2022-12-11 06:10:32] <+ForgottenReaper> Same braincell
[2022-12-11 06:10:33] <%Kardmager> The twist is the waterfall is a mimic and it sucked the water out of him
[2022-12-11 06:11:10] <%+Usinji> misted to death wouldn't be a terrible way to go

[2022-12-11 06:48:07] <DraygoDraygon> Do the items have weight?
[2022-12-11 06:48:34] <DraygoDraygon> Do they need stuff to help ferry it? I assume you can't make like conveyors, but
[2022-12-11 06:48:49] <%Ravenkorpse> wtf did you kill that weighed that much
[2022-12-11 06:48:50] <%AccompanyingArmor> Yeah, really easy to see item weight change move speed when hauling boulders
[2022-12-11 06:48:58] <%AccompanyingArmor> you can use minecarts i think
[2022-12-11 06:49:08] <DraygoDraygon> Can ya chop it up carry piecemeal?

[2022-12-11 06:50:25] <%AccompanyingArmor> You need yourself a Dwarf forklift
[2022-12-11 06:50:26] <+o_Ogoor> !please
[2022-12-11 06:50:26] <@^Moobot> @o_Ogoor Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-11 06:50:28] <+ThatSl1me> ya wheelbarrows are great
[2022-12-11 06:50:42] <%Lovestruck> Is this like rim world?

[2022-12-11 06:51:11] <$Nathangnouv> how many dwarves died to the rok?
[2022-12-11 06:51:27] <Dadburry> they are socks
[2022-12-11 06:51:31] <%+scottish1900> Boots for armor
[2022-12-11 06:51:32] <%AccompanyingArmor> chausse are metal armored socks i think
[2022-12-11 06:51:41] <%+scottish1900> Er, yeah they are armored socks
[2022-12-11 06:51:54] <smilingowl> chain socks ... very metal
[2022-12-11 06:52:07] <+Bigglebee> !please
[2022-12-11 06:52:07] <@^Moobot> @Bigglebee Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-11 06:52:12] <%AccompanyingArmor> I think you wear them under plate armor
[2022-12-11 06:52:17] <+bossdevildogg> So there was a dinosaur that was 70ish tons and was like 70fr long. It was the Argentinosaurus.
[2022-12-11 06:52:31] <+bossdevildogg> 70 feet long
[2022-12-11 06:53:00] <%AccompanyingArmor> @bossdevildogg i wonder what country they found it in richLet
[2022-12-11 06:53:46] <Cheeseers48> chausses are kinda chaps
[2022-12-11 06:54:07] <Cheeseers48> kinda like chaps*
[2022-12-11 06:54:18] <grippus_> I fell asleep last night after the dwarves killed that enormous bird. Did they ever butcher it or move it, or is it just rotting there?
[2022-12-11 06:55:00] <grippus_> Tasty
[2022-12-11 06:55:01] <smilingowl> my son!
[2022-12-11 06:55:28] <yuwuumi> are there dragons in df?
[2022-12-11 06:55:28] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 06:55:38] <smilingowl> the5re are dragonsy, yes
[2022-12-11 06:55:42] <smilingowl> ups
[2022-12-11 06:56:22] <DraygoDraygon> What're mushrooms but tiny plump helmets
[2022-12-11 06:58:16] <%AccompanyingArmor> I love the idea of mushrooms, but my body just doesnt accept them
[2022-12-11 06:58:56] <DraygoDraygon> There's some tasty mushrooms/ways to prepare em. I love portabellos
[2022-12-11 06:59:00] <DraygoDraygon> Taste like steak
[2022-12-11 06:59:16] <%AccompanyingArmor> Like them being able to grow anywhere and fungal
[2022-12-11 06:59:29] <%AccompanyingArmor> but the texture makes my gag reflex act up
[2022-12-11 06:59:31] <%MistaBoogie> that's a lot of dwarves
[2022-12-11 06:59:59] <%AccompanyingArmor> Ive tried them numerous times but it never works :(
[2022-12-11 07:00:03] <DraygoDraygon> AccompanyingArmor Bread and fry em, they get all crispy
[2022-12-11 07:00:09] <DraygoDraygon> Or in soup
[2022-12-11 07:00:13] <+Antonius_Hubertus> If the texture upsets you, you could always prepare them in sauces
[2022-12-11 07:00:25] <DraygoDraygon> That too, or use them ground up AS sauces
[2022-12-11 07:00:29] <DraygoDraygon> Or flavoring
[2022-12-11 07:00:48] <SaucyGiraffe> im not buying this, cause everyone seems confused about this game that came out 20 years ago
[2022-12-11 07:01:21] <smilingowl> i mean it is still available for free
[2022-12-11 07:01:45] <DraygoDraygon> Two guys worked on it for free for 15 years and eventually added actual graphics and UI
[2022-12-11 07:01:50] <SaucyGiraffe> I might do the free thing
[2022-12-11 07:02:01] <DraygoDraygon> It looks like a great game if you like this sort of thing, and this version doesn't hurt your eyes
[2022-12-11 07:02:06] <+Antonius_Hubertus> What is that long tunnel of water you've got going on there?
[2022-12-11 07:02:17] <smilingowl> i bought it just for the grid and determination to develop it on their on time for decade
[2022-12-11 07:02:32] <%AccompanyingArmor> OG dwarf fortress is a good novelty but it takes alot of effort and adderal to learn
[2022-12-11 07:02:33] <%+CoolBoogie> Do you still have everyone set up to be a lumberjack?
[2022-12-11 07:02:44] <%AccompanyingArmor> I think this "remaster" is great
[2022-12-11 07:03:05] <Bujeebus> so I had a fire breath crocodile forgotten beast, killed it no problem. the fire it set though? 3 dorfs just stood around in it >:(

[2022-12-11 07:05:56] <%AccompanyingArmor> Lots of similarities, lots of differences
[2022-12-11 07:06:12] <%AccompanyingArmor> It had a high barrier to entry, mouse support and tile set is a godsend
[2022-12-11 07:06:20] <Reapercometh> oh i agree learning to control it was insane
[2022-12-11 07:06:26] <Reapercometh> learning every keybind was nut
[2022-12-11 07:06:31] <Reapercometh> but mandatory
[2022-12-11 07:07:31] <+painter42> I am plan on buying this game
[2022-12-11 07:07:36] <SaucyGiraffe> maybe I will come back in a year
[2022-12-11 07:07:41] <Reapercometh> i mean the fact they got this out sooner then i expected is a good start
[2022-12-11 07:08:05] <%AccompanyingArmor> tectonic plate shifting is pretty important tbh
[2022-12-11 07:08:08] <DraygoDraygon> The amount of jank
[2022-12-11 07:08:20] <+Esperae> i heard he was always resistant to doing any real optimization on the game because he didn't want to do it himself and didn't want to hire more people, maybe we'll see that change

[2022-12-11 07:11:16] <%AccompanyingArmor> Tracking every 60 thousand strands of dwarf beard hair
[2022-12-11 07:11:17] <+RitualSauce> I would assume that the revenue this produced gives the devs the ability to keep going with their own crazy passion projects while employing a dedicated team to iron out QoL
[2022-12-11 07:11:32] <smilingowl> i remember an interview where one of the brothers said that he will do this for his whole life
[2022-12-11 07:11:36] <styyygian> this game is gonna be more real than real life
[2022-12-11 07:11:45] <Ruinkind> I'd guess it would evolve heavily over that many years, but I have my doubts with this man.  :D
[2022-12-11 07:11:58] <%EpicPumaNess> alright when I'm 54 I'll buy the game then Kappa
[2022-12-11 07:12:12] <+bossdevildogg> Compound interest
[2022-12-11 07:12:23] <Ruinkind> My doubts it would evolve heavily, almost a 2.0, but who knows.
[2022-12-11 07:12:40] <+k_nord> the law is breaking up!
[2022-12-11 07:12:40] <%SkyLineAce> cops are bad news
[2022-12-11 07:12:56] <+RitualSauce> afaik they also needed some added revenue to handle real world healthcare costs so real life can really change those crazy dreams

[2022-12-11 07:13:19] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> did you bribe the cop with sexual favours?
[2022-12-11 07:13:55] <Ruinkind> It seems like hes working towards his masterpiece, my doubts are related to him wanting to alter it too far from his vision to make people happy.
[2022-12-11 07:14:03] <%Kardmager> Killed the witness during the investigation?

[2022-12-11 07:18:24] <%h4rdcorenub> you can redo the bluing

[2022-12-11 07:19:45] <styyygian> just one?

[2022-12-11 07:19:50] <izamodragon> dick can u explain this ive seen  you play this for a bit  but missed the begining
[2022-12-11 07:19:51] <%AccompanyingArmor> but black powder is so much fun :) you never know whatll happen when you pull the trigger
[2022-12-11 07:19:58] <+ThatSl1me> definitely not a major design flaw just dont look at it
[2022-12-11 07:20:21] <Allimon> What are you doing with the water?
[2022-12-11 07:20:22] <styyygian> sounds very much like a bomb in disguise
[2022-12-11 07:20:39] <%h4rdcorenub> just some takedown pins
[2022-12-11 07:21:02] <%AccompanyingArmor> are they captive pins
[2022-12-11 07:21:07] <Ruinkind> I always appreciated the simplistic yet incredibly complex design behind them.
[2022-12-11 07:21:08] <!%+krainboltgreene> I fell asleep what happened with the water fall
[2022-12-11 07:21:09] <inqusitionandchill> lever rifles are super cool to look at the internals of
[2022-12-11 07:21:51] <+Nyamses> The floor with 3-room accommodations is for nobles? Since you included a coffin in the back
[2022-12-11 07:22:25] <%h4rdcorenub> what caliber?
[2022-12-11 07:22:29] <inqusitionandchill> nice, henry 30.06 octagonal
[2022-12-11 07:22:44] <+RitualSauce> ehhh that's still tough to find
[2022-12-11 07:23:01] <%h4rdcorenub> well. I do not have 41mag dies for reloading
[2022-12-11 07:23:05] <+bossdevildogg> 45-70?
[2022-12-11 07:23:34] <+bossdevildogg> 30?
[2022-12-11 07:23:43] <inqusitionandchill> feels like how asking for 10 mil pistol ammo here in neb they ask are you stupid with there no
[2022-12-11 07:23:46] <%h4rdcorenub> I have 350 legend, 450 bushmaster, 45-70, 450 marlin, and 444 marlin reloading dies
[2022-12-11 07:24:01] <%AccompanyingArmor> I thought 45-70 was straight wall?
[2022-12-11 07:24:12] <+RitualSauce> that's an incredibly weird law LUL
[2022-12-11 07:24:22] <%h4rdcorenub> 45-70 is a straigt wall, belted magnum
[2022-12-11 07:24:24] <%AccompanyingArmor> at least thats what I remember from mine, though it has a rimmed base
[2022-12-11 07:24:38] <%AccompanyingArmor> been a while since ive taken it out
[2022-12-11 07:24:45] <+painter42> My dad hunted with a smi atou 360 and used a 270
[2022-12-11 07:25:05] <%h4rdcorenub> same rules as ohio
[2022-12-11 07:25:16] <%h4rdcorenub> you have to trim the brass short to make it legal
[2022-12-11 07:25:23] <%h4rdcorenub> same with the 450 bushmaster
[2022-12-11 07:25:30] <+bossdevildogg> So an m1 carbine the shoots 30 cal would work
[2022-12-11 07:25:32] <%h4rdcorenub> its fine. jsut gotta use FTX bullets
[2022-12-11 07:26:01] <+devilishpuppy> Do you think you have 183 bedrooms?
[2022-12-11 07:27:09] <%Ravenkorpse> if only they would make a non ascii version if CDDA

[2022-12-11 07:27:23] <%h4rdcorenub> its a non game speices
[2022-12-11 07:27:47] <%h4rdcorenub> oh yeha, the shotgun law crap is dumb
[2022-12-11 07:28:30] <+RitualSauce> yeah they're "vermin" in most places
[2022-12-11 07:28:35] <+painter42> Hunting laws sometimes make no sense
[2022-12-11 07:28:37] <%h4rdcorenub> in Texas out deer are like 1/2 the body size and most guys out there shooting 300 Win Mags at them
[2022-12-11 07:29:04] <+RitualSauce> hunting/gun laws often make no sense. they're not made with any input from firearm experts.
[2022-12-11 07:29:11] <soulieke> so they overpopulated or not native?
[2022-12-11 07:29:19] <$Dishonest_abe> MFW Tarkov for coyotes
[2022-12-11 07:29:40] <+painter42> Hunting in the dark with guns is asking to get shot
[2022-12-11 07:29:44] <Bujeebus> @soulieke ppl dont like them
[2022-12-11 07:29:45] <smilingowl> what do they do to reserve that tag?
[2022-12-11 07:29:56] <soulieke> aha
[2022-12-11 07:30:01] <%+trevorsgame1> coyotes will eat all small animals if they want
[2022-12-11 07:30:10] <%+trevorsgame1> specially chikens
[2022-12-11 07:30:21] <%+trevorsgame1> they love some of them tendies
[2022-12-11 07:30:31] <+RitualSauce> people have a major boner for killing/hating coyotes when they do almost no damage to livestock comparatively speaking but 🤷
[2022-12-11 07:30:43] <+RitualSauce> there's always the occasional chicken massacre tho LUL
[2022-12-11 07:31:18] <+RitualSauce> it would take like 20 coyotes to kill a deer LUL
[2022-12-11 07:31:21] <smilingowl> here where i life we reinvite the wolf because they help keep the board and deer population under controll
[2022-12-11 07:31:54] <Ruinkind> Its something we are "allowed" to hate and destroy.
[2022-12-11 07:32:09] <smilingowl> xD tactical wolves
[2022-12-11 07:32:12] <Ruinkind> We do like to do some killin', as much as we don't like to admit it.
[2022-12-11 07:32:12] <%$mord_> Aren't deer considered to be overpopulated?
[2022-12-11 07:32:21] <%AccompanyingArmor> wolf killstreak
[2022-12-11 07:32:59] <%+WarpedVulpes> @smilingowl that's the general idea of predator:prey ratios, if there's too many predators and not enough prey, the predator population drops, but if there's too much prey, the predator population thrives and overhunts, repeating cycle
[2022-12-11 07:33:05] <+RitualSauce> the whole issue of overpop and even needing to reintroduce wolves is because we had no sense of the damage we caused by purging wolves in the first place
[2022-12-11 07:33:57] <%Ravenkorpse> do you get any bobcats up there
[2022-12-11 07:34:45] <+RitualSauce> and rabbit is delicious
[2022-12-11 07:34:54] <%EpicPumaNess> I've never had rabbit, want to try it
[2022-12-11 07:35:01] <+RitualSauce> i've never had squirrel but i enjoy rabbit
[2022-12-11 07:35:05] <%+WarpedVulpes> Eventually that issue reverses though, doesn't it Mr. Hammer?
[2022-12-11 07:35:18] <+safid_> Duck is S tier
[2022-12-11 07:35:39] <%Ravenkorpse> squirrel and gracy over texas toast is so good
[2022-12-11 07:36:00] <+RitualSauce> its almost like we need similar practices for hunting as we do for farming. crop rotation and appropriate fallowing is critically important. same concepts apply to hunting.
[2022-12-11 07:36:04] <TUR7L3> Nature uhhh... finds a way
[2022-12-11 07:36:04] <%+WarpedVulpes> Short of the intervention of people
[2022-12-11 07:36:15] <smilingowl> it will fluctuate till it reaches a kind of cyclic population change
[2022-12-11 07:37:05] <Bujeebus> no such thing as a wild horse in america. they're not native, they're feral
[2022-12-11 07:37:43] <%+WarpedVulpes> In all fairness, it's not really leaving them to rot

[2022-12-11 07:37:46] <Bujeebus> but also in some places protected because... horses are cool?
[2022-12-11 07:38:08] <%+WarpedVulpes> Many things will still eat the dead coyote, even if they're not carnivorous
[2022-12-11 07:38:08] <+RitualSauce> yeah biologists would disagree on that "no wild horses" thing
[2022-12-11 07:38:44] <Bujeebus> I mean same thing with cats
[2022-12-11 07:38:45] <+RitualSauce> they've been here for nearly 700 years and only went extinct here shortly after people showed up in the first place
[2022-12-11 07:38:45] <%AccompanyingArmor> The Assateague and Chincoteague horses are super popular around here
[2022-12-11 07:38:55] <%+WarpedVulpes> That is true
[2022-12-11 07:39:09] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> biologists are one of the most cuck scientist types
[2022-12-11 07:39:21] <%AccompanyingArmor> Seen them in person dozens of time, though there the protected bunch, i dont think they kill them
[2022-12-11 07:39:29] <Deleroth> moose?
[2022-12-11 07:39:31] <%AccompanyingArmor> I think their ponies though
[2022-12-11 07:39:35] <%RogueSand> @blazeit69YOLOswag based
[2022-12-11 07:39:38] <SwiftXander> @AccompanyingArmor Agreed, have seen them a few times myself
[2022-12-11 07:39:42] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> fucking medicine and microbiologists cut their lunch
[2022-12-11 07:39:48] <+RitualSauce> mosquitos :)
[2022-12-11 07:39:51] <Bujeebus> people just fucking love horses
[2022-12-11 07:39:52] <+RitualSauce> rats :)
[2022-12-11 07:40:13] <%+WarpedVulpes> I'm absolutely not defending killing animals just because they're a nuisance, and it's a bit of a tighter situation up here in Canada, especially considering recent bills
[2022-12-11 07:40:38] <+Merc_The_Jerk> same with boars. shits rampant down here in TX
[2022-12-11 07:40:49] <+safid_> You were making a swan lake for your dwarves to go admire
[2022-12-11 07:41:08] <$Markeh04> the problem keeps extending
[2022-12-11 07:41:16] <$Markeh04> Also good evening!
[2022-12-11 07:42:04] <%Anandil> not to even mention introduced and destructive species, those have to die sometimes

[2022-12-11 07:42:17] <%+WarpedVulpes> Absolutely, but I more mean the senseless killing of animals, leaving them to rot
[2022-12-11 07:42:22] <tipereth6> as well as invasive species, dont forget them either
[2022-12-11 07:42:51] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> LUL you think you're a top species?
[2022-12-11 07:43:11] <%h4rdcorenub> If those animals didn't want to be eaten, they wouldn't taste so good

[2022-12-11 07:44:03] <tipereth6> mister desert eagle can introduce the hippo to the foodweb
[2022-12-11 07:44:15] <Ruinkind> I don't fully agree with conservation, things go extinct for a reason.  A lot of wasted effort to preserve for a human idea of fulfillment.
[2022-12-11 07:44:19] <+RitualSauce> tbf the amount of people that think they can fight a bear or chimpanzee is way too fucking high

[2022-12-11 07:44:57] <freeman6996> so i'm starting a new fort rn, basically newbie. i want to have a dwarf that can make music, is it worth more to skill him as a musician or should i skill him into a specific instrument? which would be better?
[2022-12-11 07:45:00] <%+trevorsgame1> darwinism @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-11 07:45:02] <$Markeh04> You don't need to outrun a hippo, if you don't go to their habitat
[2022-12-11 07:45:04] <+RitualSauce> most people are killed by hippos gathering water because they don't have plumbing @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-11 07:45:06] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> If i get outsmarted by a hippo then I deserve to be taken out of the gene pool
[2022-12-11 07:45:06] <bobakanuse> yes they are honestly
[2022-12-11 07:45:07] <tipereth6> its some well understood Monster Hunting rules. Dont go in its biome
[2022-12-11 07:45:11] <+devilishpuppy> Hippos are much like alligators at night.
[2022-12-11 07:45:13] <smilingowl> hippos are so agressiv and warn you outrite if they annoy you
[2022-12-11 07:45:16] <+devilishpuppy> They will charge you down at night time
[2022-12-11 07:45:22] <+painter42> Hippos are quick
[2022-12-11 07:45:29] <+Antonius_Hubertus> It's not like you're walking down the street and a hippo appears out of nowhere at full speed
[2022-12-11 07:45:31] <+Felstrike> so you more into bigfoot or Sasquatch?
[2022-12-11 07:45:39] <freeman6996> i'm from south africa. hippo's kill more people than lions. they are very dangerous.
[2022-12-11 07:45:42] <+insidewalk> hippo got that linebacker speed, not that wide receiver speed
[2022-12-11 07:45:46] <+Ellycat1> The hippo is coming for you right now danKappa
[2022-12-11 07:45:52] <freeman6996> they come out at night. and people walk into them
[2022-12-11 07:45:52] <%h4rdcorenub> Hippos are hungry hungry
[2022-12-11 07:45:59] <%EpicPumaNess> if you get killed by a hippo, that's just natural selection at work
[2022-12-11 07:45:59] <freeman6996> onto land
[2022-12-11 07:46:12] <+RitualSauce> the reason people are killed by hippos is because they come between the hippo and the water while gathering water
[2022-12-11 07:46:32] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> just going for a midnight stroll in remove africa
[2022-12-11 07:46:32] <+devilishpuppy> because hippos land is like 1-2 miles in the dark
[2022-12-11 07:46:33] <+devilishpuppy> LUL
[2022-12-11 07:46:34] <freeman6996> lol. south africa has many rural areas.
[2022-12-11 07:46:35] <Ruinkind> Hippos are very territorial, don't upset hippo's in hippo land.
[2022-12-11 07:46:37] <%+WarpedVulpes> It's all avoidable, just stay inside
[2022-12-11 07:46:37] <styyygian> apparently hippos can run at nearly 20mph??? what the fuck???
[2022-12-11 07:46:38] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> *remote
[2022-12-11 07:46:41] <%+WarpedVulpes> do not touch grass
[2022-12-11 07:46:46] <%Anandil> might be worse to use a flashlight

[2022-12-11 07:47:01] <%AccompanyingArmor> hippos sleep at night
[2022-12-11 07:47:02] <freeman6996> anyway, hippos aside, so i'm starting a new fort rn, basically newbie. i want to have a dwarf that can make music, is it worth more to skill him as a musician or should i skill him into a specific instrument? which would be better?
[2022-12-11 07:47:02] <+devilishpuppy> @AlexOfDoom its fine, the titans will sort them out
[2022-12-11 07:47:05] <%AccompanyingArmor> i think
[2022-12-11 07:47:05] <+painter42> Most likely there protecting there young and your in the wrong place
[2022-12-11 07:47:16] <tipereth6> oh yeah, similar any other large mammal
[2022-12-11 07:47:43] <+RitualSauce> @freeman6996 afaik its harder to make a dedicated "musician" instead of focusing on a single instrument

[2022-12-11 07:47:52] <+insidewalk> they're supper territorial and the biggest killer in africa
[2022-12-11 07:48:00] <+insidewalk> for animals
[2022-12-11 07:48:01] <+RitualSauce> orca whale
[2022-12-11 07:48:06] <%+bortz29> maybe they just have a high rate of killing in their attacks, like not that many attacks but mostly fatal
[2022-12-11 07:48:11] <+Felstrike> Googles says hippos kill 500 humans on average a year
[2022-12-11 07:48:13] <+RitualSauce> LUL
[2022-12-11 07:48:20] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> Turns out what is and isn't hippo land isn't clearly signposted. Hippos should invest in signage
[2022-12-11 07:48:25] <+RitualSauce> naw cows kill way more people than hippos
[2022-12-11 07:48:26] <styyygian> where people are like "oh hippos are so cute look at how cute they are" and then they get eaten by the hippo because they get too close
[2022-12-11 07:48:31] <%EpicPumaNess> mosquitos are probably the most dangerous animal
[2022-12-11 07:48:33] <+RitualSauce> cows and water buffalo
[2022-12-11 07:48:33] <%Anandil> you never know, i was in a city and run into a bunch of sealions sleeping  next to the street
[2022-12-11 07:48:39] <tipereth6> the only known related deaths to Orcas have been the ones attempted to be kept in captivity
[2022-12-11 07:48:42] <$Markeh04> Orcas probably kill a lot of marine life, but definetly not a lot of humans
[2022-12-11 07:48:43] <Pimplejewce> meese always intimidate me lol
[2022-12-11 07:48:47] <+RitualSauce> @EpicPumaNess true. no contest there.
[2022-12-11 07:48:51] <%h4rdcorenub> Cleary Humans are Mammals, and kill more Humans
[2022-12-11 07:48:54] <LeprechaunX> Horses probably kill more people than Hippos
[2022-12-11 07:48:56] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> I mean, the presence of massive fucking hippos is a dead give away there's hippos in the area
[2022-12-11 07:49:05] <%EpicPumaNess> waht are you doing that you iknow what a hippo sounds like when it shits?
[2022-12-11 07:49:05] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> cunts arent exactly hiding in the bushes

[2022-12-11 07:49:37] <Ruinkind> I'm almost curious enough to dig into the research and find out how many deaths are related to humans being dumb and avoiding the dangers.
[2022-12-11 07:49:39] <%h4rdcorenub> Humans are mammals
[2022-12-11 07:49:41] <+RitualSauce> most deadly mammals are definitely humans Kappa
[2022-12-11 07:49:46] <Ruinkind> ignoring*
[2022-12-11 07:49:46] <%EpicPumaNess> ^
[2022-12-11 07:49:47] <%+Destrina> Humans then
[2022-12-11 07:49:50] <+RitualSauce> k so then its cows
[2022-12-11 07:49:54] <tipereth6> mosquito's being insectoid changes the scheme of things considering body count
[2022-12-11 07:49:55] <%+Usinji> What a banger
[2022-12-11 07:50:05] <+RitualSauce> cows literally just lean on people and kill them all the time
[2022-12-11 07:50:06] <LeprechaunX> Horses and Mountain Cats probably kill more people than Hippos
[2022-12-11 07:50:10] <%EpicPumaNess> this is a banger
[2022-12-11 07:50:10] <%+Glithir> richBobble
[2022-12-11 07:50:15] <+denm101> Kangaroos can be brutal
[2022-12-11 07:50:19] <tipereth6> strangely enough Mosquitoes are the 3rd best pollinator in the world, despite being killing machines
[2022-12-11 07:50:23] <LeprechaunX> Yeh I'd think Cows would be up there
[2022-12-11 07:50:23] <%+WarpedVulpes> 20 americans a year is cows
[2022-12-11 07:50:33] <+BlackShi> 6k food and 2.5k drink. that is a lot of resources.
[2022-12-11 07:50:38] <styyygian> apparently hippos also attack boats and raid farms for food
[2022-12-11 07:50:43] <+Felstrike> Cows only kill 22 humans on average a year on average

[2022-12-11 07:52:58] <Ruinkind> A lot of these hippo kills in recent years are from fishermen and labourer's literally going into hippo land to try and take it over.  :D

[2022-12-11 07:56:30] <%+WarpedVulpes> A lot of it is the type of people that buy those types of dogs
[2022-12-11 07:56:36] <+BlackShi> If a domestic dog kills someone, it is the owners fault...
[2022-12-11 07:56:36] <smilingowl> a good socialiced pit bull is such a wonderfull good boy
[2022-12-11 07:56:45] <%TheOriginalFelord> my pitbull kills me with kindness
[2022-12-11 07:56:46] <$SovietWinter> To me that's just more reason for people not to have them
[2022-12-11 07:57:01] <Ruinkind> Don't forget, they are often purchased because they are viewed as aggressive, and trained to be aggressive by dumb owners.
[2022-12-11 07:57:04] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> imagine going down to a Jack Russle
[2022-12-11 07:57:07] <+anonimolmakistiyorum11> confirmed kill KEKW

[2022-12-11 07:57:24] <%TheOriginalFelord> Jack russels make sense though
[2022-12-11 07:57:31] <%TheOriginalFelord> they were breed to be fox killers
[2022-12-11 07:57:31] <Pimplejewce> I wonder if there has been a jack Russell with MULTIPLE confirmed kills
[2022-12-11 07:57:37] <+RitualSauce> yeah lots of people treat pit bulls like objects that get tied up outdoors and beaten and people are shocked when they bite back then their bite force is just naturally so much greater than other dogs
[2022-12-11 07:57:42] <%+trevorsgame1> ive had yorkies and pomeranians bite more then any pitbul
[2022-12-11 07:57:47] <twixxalot> they wont
[2022-12-11 07:57:47] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 07:57:52] <megruda> the only way to stop a bad guy with a dog is a good guy with a dog
[2022-12-11 07:57:54] <smilingowl> they tried that here in germany, and they switched the breed
[2022-12-11 07:57:56] <$SovietWinter> Everyone needs at least 2 pitbulls

[2022-12-11 07:58:11] <%TheOriginalFelord> @megruda I mean it works in pokemon
[2022-12-11 07:58:20] <Zencurse> I mean most dogs have been bred into oblivion. pit bulls r probably some of the biggest victims of this. Poor things :(
[2022-12-11 07:58:24] <+GarrickLynn> need a license for a dog
[2022-12-11 07:58:30] <%$Spideycloned> I mean the argument really is "The only way to stop a bad guy with a dog is a good guy with a BIGGER BADDER dog"
[2022-12-11 07:58:36] <%+WarpedVulpes> The type of people that tend to buy pit bulls are often people in A. Shitty neighborhoods, or B. People that want them to be aggressive
[2022-12-11 07:58:44] <Crajabzul> Pitties are so sweet
[2022-12-11 07:58:55] <%+Destrina> I have a pit bull mix and she's the sweetest dog.
[2022-12-11 07:59:01] <+devilishpuppy> pit mix sounds like some sort of premix cake
[2022-12-11 07:59:03] <mrsatism> pitbull bigotry is real and weird
[2022-12-11 07:59:09] <+RitualSauce> a pitbull bite is also much more dangerous than a chihuahua bite. and i bet chihuahuas bite more often LUL
[2022-12-11 07:59:10] <$SovietWinter> So then how would I reduce how many are killed by them?
[2022-12-11 07:59:19] <Crajabzul> As long as you don't treat your pit bull like shit, they're a pretty sweet dog breed.
[2022-12-11 07:59:20] <tipereth6> kill or be killed
[2022-12-11 07:59:21] <%SpadesOmega> wait the human is the pet?
[2022-12-11 07:59:24] <mrsatism> but theyre so cute!
[2022-12-11 07:59:28] <%$eSaltcracker> and most pets dont get even a fraction of the training needed for them to fit in properly
[2022-12-11 07:59:32] <smilingowl> my neighbour lost her arm because she got a infection from an cat sratch, beware the claw
[2022-12-11 07:59:51] <tipereth6> eugenics as failed the Canine as a species
[2022-12-11 07:59:53] <%+WarpedVulpes> @SpadesOmega if you go back a few hundred years
[2022-12-11 07:59:58] <tipereth6> has* failed
[2022-12-11 08:00:04] <+devilishpuppy> @smilingowl cat scratch fever should be a well known thing in the cat owner community
[2022-12-11 08:00:21] <smilingowl> she was 80 and didnt said a word
[2022-12-11 08:00:22] <+devilishpuppy> I'd argue the only reason animals are so dangerous is because people are so stupid
[2022-12-11 08:00:24] <+RitualSauce> you serve the cat
[2022-12-11 08:00:36] <%+Destrina> People over generations turned wolves into chihuahuas.
[2022-12-11 08:00:38] <%Anandil> my cats are, they like to go on walks with me
[2022-12-11 08:00:39] <%h4rdcorenub> A Rottweiler ripped my nose off when I was 4 years old. So I personally dont like them as much as other breeds.
[2022-12-11 08:00:41] <%100viewbots> we're just roommates
[2022-12-11 08:00:41] <Pimplejewce> I balance it out by making demands
[2022-12-11 08:00:46] <+RitualSauce> we're stupid because we're also animals LUL
[2022-12-11 08:00:48] <Zencurse> Kitties > Literally any dog. not biased ;)
[2022-12-11 08:00:53] <%$eSaltcracker> 100% people are dumb
[2022-12-11 08:00:56] <Pimplejewce> I get 30 seconds of cuddle time regardless of the cats mood
[2022-12-11 08:00:57] <tipereth6> is your nose fine omg?
[2022-12-11 08:01:06] <+devilishpuppy> Yes, but thats because the person is dumb LUL
[2022-12-11 08:01:11] <%TheOriginalFelord> my dog wont hurt me, but will fuck someone up given the situation
[2022-12-11 08:01:18] <+Bivymack> “My dog is so well behaved he doesn’t need to be on a leash”
[2022-12-11 08:01:19] <mrsatism> its like saying that an untrained human is not dangerous
[2022-12-11 08:01:19] <$SovietWinter> I see people walking their dog with no leash sometimes. How big of a douchebag can you be
[2022-12-11 08:01:38] <%EpicPumaNess> haha jokes on your. my dog is imaginary
[2022-12-11 08:01:47] <+devilishpuppy> haha jokes on you my dogs are dead
[2022-12-11 08:01:53] <+devilishpuppy> They run over them instead
[2022-12-11 08:01:54] <Ruinkind> Ride your bicycle down a rural road, you'll get chased by a pack of farm dogs at least once.  LUL
[2022-12-11 08:01:55] <+devilishpuppy> :)

[2022-12-11 08:02:04] <smilingowl> i always ask if he is petable if i see a good boy
[2022-12-11 08:02:19] <ReformingOne> I'm curious, what are your thoughts on police dogs Richard?
[2022-12-11 08:02:23] <%Kardmager> If you stop reporting animal kills then the problem just goes away  richKrappa
[2022-12-11 08:02:24] <$Markeh04> I mean even trained animals can still attack because of unknown variables.
[2022-12-11 08:02:27] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> kill children so my dog doesnt bite them richHam
[2022-12-11 08:02:30] <+devilishpuppy> I've had many dogs over many years, i've yet to have one hurt another person apart from me.
[2022-12-11 08:02:32] <$SovietWinter> Also someone else can get hurt
[2022-12-11 08:02:33] <+BlackShi> Looks like you got into the cave sections. How are the caves treating you so far @Richard_Hammer ?
[2022-12-11 08:02:35] <%AccompanyingArmor> The largest pet I owned has been a lizard
[2022-12-11 08:02:39] <mrsatism> @blazeit69YOLOswag yes
[2022-12-11 08:02:42] <%AccompanyingArmor> No worries here
[2022-12-11 08:02:53] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> hazard eliminated richHamel
[2022-12-11 08:02:57] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> I agree with the infanticide policy
[2022-12-11 08:03:03] <%EpicPumaNess> i like animals, but im a lazy person and of all the pets ibe had, its never been my decison to get them
[2022-12-11 08:03:13] <Zencurse> I got mauled by a dog at age 6 just for stepping foot into the owning families house
[2022-12-11 08:03:23] <Zencurse> they can b cray
[2022-12-11 08:03:24] <mrsatism> @ReformingOne IMO, would be nice if they werent manipulated by the cops. But dogs are amazing service animals
[2022-12-11 08:03:35] <%Raptorez> Lakart is gonna get eaten by a lizard and fuck with the statistics
[2022-12-11 08:03:46] <%TheOriginalFelord> ^
[2022-12-11 08:03:47] <Ruinkind> Sheltered dogs can be very very unpredictable.  @Zencurse
[2022-12-11 08:03:51] <%TheOriginalFelord> thats what I keep telling him
[2022-12-11 08:04:03] <%Kardmager> Lakart going to accidentally breed Godzilla
[2022-12-11 08:04:03] <Ruinkind> If they don't socialize, they can fly off the handle at the oddest things.
[2022-12-11 08:04:25] <tipereth6> isolation and confinement can trigger trauma responses even in humans
[2022-12-11 08:04:28] <tipereth6> let alone dogs
[2022-12-11 08:04:52] <Skip_Esquire> "Furbabies" LUL
[2022-12-11 08:05:11] <%Anandil> dog gets too protective/overconfident and does stupid shit, classic with small dogs
[2022-12-11 08:05:22] <+BlackShi> I don't like when people pick up their dogs when the dog does something bad. It just reinforces bad behavior. That is why most small dogs are barky and aggressive.
[2022-12-11 08:05:29] <Zencurse> Part of why I prefer cats. they can be independent if they need to be. I travel a lot for work so its good for me
[2022-12-11 08:05:33] <%Ungaiii> I got pretty lucky with my golden, but she did have two years of trauma by the time we got her
[2022-12-11 08:05:36] <%TheOriginalFelord> yeah good luck with that
[2022-12-11 08:05:42] <%+Destrina> My parents are terrible dog owners, their dogs don't listen at all, bark all the time, run away, snap when around food, etc. The only upside is that they're small dogs that would have a hard time actually hurting anyone.
[2022-12-11 08:05:56] <$Markeh04> Every time someone say furbaby, it hurts me. How did that nickname got adopted or is it just that I'm permanently online?
[2022-12-11 08:06:00] <%h4rdcorenub> those Amish horses that are pretending to be cars. they gotta have some good training
[2022-12-11 08:06:03] <+devilishpuppy> i love taming small animals and letting people have them as pets
[2022-12-11 08:06:34] <Ruinkind> Animals are pure utility to their culture and teachings.
[2022-12-11 08:06:37] <DavieDonna> I spent the summer with the Amish this year. They even kept camels, and I rode them hahaha
[2022-12-11 08:06:47] <$SovietWinter> I was doing laundry in my shared apt room. A lady comes in with her leash less dog. Instantly it runs to my laundry bag and pees all over it. She acted like it happens all the time. Saw the dog without a leash still after that
[2022-12-11 08:06:49] <%Anandil> reductive?
[2022-12-11 08:06:50] <tipereth6> Brash?
[2022-12-11 08:06:53] <%AccompanyingArmor> The only pets I keep are the spiders and the house centipedes to kill the richmond roaches :)
[2022-12-11 08:06:57] <Zencurse> @markeh04 As a millennial that remembers the 90s before internet culture took over, I can confirm furbabies existed before then
[2022-12-11 08:06:57] <%Ungaiii> Heuristics?
[2022-12-11 08:06:58] <Tpocket> quick to judge :P
[2022-12-11 08:07:01] <%+WarpedVulpes> @Destrina I don't really agree with getting your dog to stop barking, it's their way of communication. It's, in my opinion, roughly equivalent to teaching your child to always be quiet because it's annoying, except a kid can pass a sentience test
[2022-12-11 08:07:04] <+ThatSl1me> i have also heard simlar
[2022-12-11 08:07:05] <tipereth6> I like Heuristic!
[2022-12-11 08:07:06] <%+WarpedVulpes> or, most can at least
[2022-12-11 08:07:07] <Zencurse> or the term rather
[2022-12-11 08:07:13] <+BlackShi> I have two dogs and I will always have dogs. They are wonderful and enrich my life. They also take a lot of work and no matter how old they are need constant upkeep and attention.
[2022-12-11 08:07:16] <$Markeh04> I don't understand amish people neither neoluddism
[2022-12-11 08:07:16] <%h4rdcorenub> I have Amish neighbors on both sides, and across the street. I have seen it
[2022-12-11 08:07:24] <Ruinkind> I don't think you're being dramatic about it, they are taught to used and view animals as utility.
[2022-12-11 08:07:26] <DavieDonna> The highest compliment you can pay an Amish man is "You're a hard worker". That's their #1 virtue, hard work
[2022-12-11 08:07:37] <%TheOriginalFelord> I only like thier butter
[2022-12-11 08:07:39] <AlexOfDoom> LUL

[2022-12-11 08:07:50] <Ruinkind> Not to say every Amish follows their teachings to the core.
[2022-12-11 08:07:54] <$Markeh04> whose butter is it then
[2022-12-11 08:07:54] <%Ungaiii> @tipereth6 ;)
[2022-12-11 08:07:57] <Bujeebus> chat, is anyone else having an issue hwere work orders suddenly aren't going to workshops?
[2022-12-11 08:08:04] <%+bortz29> 2 years from now you're going to get a sternly written letter about this
[2022-12-11 08:08:04] <DavieDonna> Amish have the best furnaces, stoves, and furniture
[2022-12-11 08:08:09] <Zencurse> Wait i thought the Amish were hard-core against tech. would they be watching any stream let alone this one specifically?
[2022-12-11 08:08:14] <%Kardmager> Prejudice I think was the work
[2022-12-11 08:08:18] <%Ungaiii> Not exactly mine, but it showed up a few times doing research
[2022-12-11 08:08:18] <%Kardmager> Word*
[2022-12-11 08:08:19] <%TheOriginalFelord> @Zencurse thats the joke
[2022-12-11 08:08:21] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> That's the joke
[2022-12-11 08:08:22] <%Nyret> all the amish on rumspringa watching right now
[2022-12-11 08:08:23] <%hottiefruits> wooden space heaters sound like a winning idea
[2022-12-11 08:08:28] <$Masakarie> Zencurse yea thats the joke, they wouldnt
[2022-12-11 08:08:29] <dingo2345> the only people cabable of building such a box
[2022-12-11 08:08:48] <DavieDonna> @Zencurse Depends on the Amish group actually. They tend to have an aversion to it but some use more tech than others. They're hyper sensitive to being "worldly"
[2022-12-11 08:09:09] <Deleroth> they just call us English
[2022-12-11 08:09:15] <%+Supa_Soup> essentially, goyim
[2022-12-11 08:09:16] <+ThatSl1me> how did you know you have amish watching? currently in my horse drawn buggy watching your stream on my phone. pls dont tell my fellow amish sir
[2022-12-11 08:09:26] <%Ungaiii> Back to lurk richHide
[2022-12-11 08:09:32] <dingo2345> but do they make money?
[2022-12-11 08:09:34] <$Markeh04> At that point, why not just adopt tech, what's the point?
[2022-12-11 08:09:36] <%+WarpedVulpes> I saw a thing with amish people that essentially gutted a forklift, and installed like handcranks to move it around
[2022-12-11 08:09:38] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> come here English, find me some hot mixed race porn to view
[2022-12-11 08:09:46] <Zencurse> Hah thats hilarious. hilariously stupid. but hilarious (im from California so the occasional mormon is all I tend to see)
[2022-12-11 08:09:47] <dingo2345> huh
[2022-12-11 08:09:52] <Tsarok> Do the amish use banks/
[2022-12-11 08:09:54] <%Kardmager> I had a friend in Pennsylvania that got a job like that at 19 years old
[2022-12-11 08:09:59] <%Anandil> can they use money?
[2022-12-11 08:10:05] <%Nyret> all those fucking fireplaces they build
[2022-12-11 08:10:12] <%+Supa_Soup> the pennsylvania dutch don't come out to east jersey often
[2022-12-11 08:10:13] <%Kardmager> Driving Amish around and doing stuff
[2022-12-11 08:10:16] <DavieDonna> They compare "the world" to "Babylon" and the Book of Revelation commands God's people to "come out of Babylon" so they try to eschew the ways of the "world"
[2022-12-11 08:10:23] <+Rowch2073> of course they use money lol
[2022-12-11 08:10:23] <DavieDonna> I spent all summer with them, fascinating people
[2022-12-11 08:10:30] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> richBless wtf
[2022-12-11 08:10:35] <Deleroth> odd, I would've never called amish a religion, because most religions are trying to recruit people and the amish are the opposite
[2022-12-11 08:10:47] <mrsatism> yikes
[2022-12-11 08:10:51] <%TheOriginalFelord> I meaaaaan
[2022-12-11 08:10:54] <tipereth6> oh my lawd
[2022-12-11 08:10:56] <%Anandil> wtf
[2022-12-11 08:11:09] <%+AnonTrolin> the kid?
[2022-12-11 08:11:09] <%+WarpedVulpes> Sorry, they beat what to death?
[2022-12-11 08:11:09] <Ruinkind> Wait until you find out how hardcore idealist colonies make babies.    @Deleroth
[2022-12-11 08:11:13] <tipereth6> poor pony, he just got spooked was all
[2022-12-11 08:11:15] <mrsatism> are the amish allowed to use guns? would you need to put down a pony in that situation?
[2022-12-11 08:11:21] <Zencurse> I always kinda thought it was more a culture or lifestyle not q religion. but I also assumed they tend to be traditionally Christian religiously
[2022-12-11 08:11:23] <DavieDonna> Amish is not necessarily a "religion" it's more of a culture but they tend to have very fundamentalist and literal ways of interpreting the Bible
[2022-12-11 08:11:52] <$SovietWinter> The Big Beards PogChamp
[2022-12-11 08:12:26] <DavieDonna> @mrsatism It depends on the Amish but they will tend to keep guns for hunting and protection against wild animals. Some are willing to use guns to protect from people and some are totally pacifist and non-violent
[2022-12-11 08:12:39] <%+WarpedVulpes> Hey Dick, you know vaping is the #1 cause of cervical cancer in men, right?
[2022-12-11 08:12:40] <%+WarpedVulpes> ;P
[2022-12-11 08:12:48] <mrsatism> @DavieDonna thank you
[2022-12-11 08:13:03] <%+Zmpr0wler> same around here it is just off the highway and they sell a bunch of things
[2022-12-11 08:13:19] <Deleroth> often you'll see menonites rather than amish
[2022-12-11 08:13:21] <+parallax1s> yes! they ride roller coasters and everything, so weird to see
[2022-12-11 08:13:24] <+ThatSl1me> they also have giant volleyball gatherings on sundays after church
[2022-12-11 08:13:33] <Deleroth> but I have seen them at cedar point before
[2022-12-11 08:13:33] <Zencurse> The image of an Amish family with their hands up yelling "weee" on a Rollercoaster is an image i didn't think I needed in my life. but it helps
[2022-12-11 08:13:39] <%Ravenkorpse> there was a gang of amish going around the community "assaulting" other amish by breaking into their house at night and shaving off their beards
[2022-12-11 08:13:40] <DavieDonna> I liked the Amish I spent this summer with. I wouldn't want to live that way forever, but I see some value in it. They were hyper concerned with virtue and building character
[2022-12-11 08:13:47] <Ruinkind> I've personally been offered a bottle of whiskey and 20 bucks 15 years ago to impregnate a very very young colony girl, it was pretty gross.  They like to get their numbers up, not just stay local.  @Deleroth
[2022-12-11 08:13:50] <%+WarpedVulpes> menintites?
[2022-12-11 08:13:56] <Deleroth> it's all "does their clothing look homemade or just old"
[2022-12-11 08:14:12] <%+Supa_Soup> lancaster pa
[2022-12-11 08:14:18] <%+Destrina> Mennonites. They are similar to the Amish.
[2022-12-11 08:14:23] <%h4rdcorenub> they are the Amish's Taxi drivers
[2022-12-11 08:14:25] <DavieDonna> Ah yes, there was a Meninite community from us down the mountain haha
[2022-12-11 08:14:26] <Deleroth> menonites are defo super religious
[2022-12-11 08:14:27] <+insidewalk> we have Mennonites and Hutterites in Canada, not really any amish tho
[2022-12-11 08:14:28] <%+WarpedVulpes> nono, I know what a mennonite is, my old bosses were
[2022-12-11 08:14:29] <%+WarpedVulpes> but
[2022-12-11 08:14:33] <%+Zmpr0wler> think amish but are more truthful to the use of electronics but more religious
[2022-12-11 08:14:34] <Deleroth> they use electricity and all that
[2022-12-11 08:14:36] <%+WarpedVulpes> men-in-tights
[2022-12-11 08:14:38] <+RitualSauce> just a different genre of Christian fundamentalists
[2022-12-11 08:14:47] <SchwarzPlays> Mennonites use TV, cars, etc
[2022-12-11 08:14:55] <%+Zmpr0wler> of love your neibour
[2022-12-11 08:15:05] <%TheOriginalFelord> similiar faith but less focus on home and more on spreading of the faith
[2022-12-11 08:15:15] <SchwarzPlays> Clothing is similar but they wear colors
[2022-12-11 08:15:16] <%+Supa_Soup> jirts
[2022-12-11 08:15:24] <Deleroth> @Ruinkind doesn't sound like they recruited you LUL
[2022-12-11 08:15:29] <DavieDonna> No Pentecostals are typically very "worldly" and they're known for speaking in tongues
[2022-12-11 08:15:29] <+Rowch2073> pentecostal are... scary...
[2022-12-11 08:15:29] <Pimplejewce> I had a hutterite neighbor as a kid, loved the food
[2022-12-11 08:15:31] <$Markeh04> Pentecostals are the gospel of prosperity, no?
[2022-12-11 08:15:37] <%+Zmpr0wler> menonites have color
[2022-12-11 08:15:39] <+Rowch2073> the never cut women's hair sect
[2022-12-11 08:15:41] <Deleroth> no that's not true
[2022-12-11 08:15:43] <DavieDonna> Pentecostals are nothing like Amish
[2022-12-11 08:15:46] <Ruinkind> I had to pass on that, reported it but ultimately nothing happened.  @Deleroth LUL
[2022-12-11 08:16:00] <+insidewalk> same same but different
[2022-12-11 08:16:00] <%+Destrina> We have Hutterites and Mennonites where I live here in South Dakota. They all wore long skirts and unattractive blouses or sweaters.
[2022-12-11 08:16:02] <Fleepflammer> Yeah but they use technology
[2022-12-11 08:16:07] <Deleroth> @Markeh04 there are some that use prosperity gospel, but that's not a foundation or anything
[2022-12-11 08:16:14] <phillymilksteak> Pentecostals do the speaking in tongues thing, women only wear long skirts
[2022-12-11 08:16:14] <DavieDonna> The prosperity gospel is common in Pentecostal churches and all flavor of "evangelicals". Pentecostals are a form of evangelical Christian
[2022-12-11 08:16:15] <%TheOriginalFelord> appalachian methodists still the best with all thier snake handling and shit
[2022-12-11 08:16:19] <%+Destrina> The Hutterites raise good ass chickens around here.
[2022-12-11 08:16:20] <LeprechaunX> Nah Hutterites aren't scared of Tech at all
[2022-12-11 08:16:26] <+RitualSauce> they're all fucked up LUL
[2022-12-11 08:16:38] <ReformingOne> we had a pentecostal at my job. she refused to wear the uniform for religious reasons and only wore Jean skirts.
[2022-12-11 08:16:39] <+bossdevildogg> Thats who fought the spartans
[2022-12-11 08:16:43] <DavieDonna> @RitualSauce Chill
[2022-12-11 08:16:47] <Fleepflammer> They are super inbred communities, I have a lot of them in my area, they will literally pay people to come bang their woman
[2022-12-11 08:16:54] <%RageRequiem> Hutteriites are a bit dif, yeah, in SD as well and there are a ton here
[2022-12-11 08:16:55] <Ruinkind> Yep, we got a lot of Hutterite colonies around here in Alberta.
[2022-12-11 08:16:59] <LeprechaunX> Hutterites work hard AF, use the most advanced tech they can get their hands.on
[2022-12-11 08:17:00] <Fleepflammer> And na they're also located in the states still
[2022-12-11 08:17:00] <Ruinkind> Mennonites too.
[2022-12-11 08:17:01] <%+Zmpr0wler> i know menonites are harder on love your neibour type and help people amish are asshole hypocrites
[2022-12-11 08:17:04] <Zencurse> Wait, just realized. weren't we talking about dog breeds? how the heck did we get here x.x
[2022-12-11 08:17:11] <Deleroth> @phillymilksteak correct on part one. part two is the case in some places, but really only for what people call "Strict pentecostals"
[2022-12-11 08:17:11] <Pimplejewce> yeah I had a friend of a friend that got paid to seed one lol
[2022-12-11 08:17:11] <Fleepflammer> Yeah they do
[2022-12-11 08:17:14] <Fleepflammer> Just minimally
[2022-12-11 08:17:16] <+insidewalk> Amish and Mennonite are pretty similar
[2022-12-11 08:17:17] <%+Destrina> @RageRequiem East or West River?
[2022-12-11 08:17:19] <DavieDonna> I don't know anything about Hutterites
[2022-12-11 08:17:23] <Pimplejewce> insane
[2022-12-11 08:17:38] <%RageRequiem> @Destrina Im in Sioux Falls
[2022-12-11 08:17:39] <%TheOriginalFelord> they'll use shit that makes theyre job a bit easier
[2022-12-11 08:17:45] <%TheOriginalFelord> but not so much entertainment
[2022-12-11 08:17:47] <DavieDonna> Adventists aren't far away either
[2022-12-11 08:17:48] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 08:18:01] <%+Destrina> I live in the Black Hills, but my sister lives in Baltic out by you @RageRequiem
[2022-12-11 08:18:01] <$Markeh04> what's the point tho?
[2022-12-11 08:18:09] <LeprechaunX> No they absolutely do.  They send their teachers to do professional development with regular teachers from the city
[2022-12-11 08:18:09] <$Markeh04> Do they think it steals your soul or something?
[2022-12-11 08:18:11] <%EpicPumaNess> also hate photographs, specifically of myself
[2022-12-11 08:18:12] <Zencurse> Photos steal your soul!
[2022-12-11 08:18:13] <Tsarok> i too hate photographs
[2022-12-11 08:18:14] <tipereth6> photos steal yo soul!
[2022-12-11 08:18:15] <+GarrickLynn> takes your soul
[2022-12-11 08:18:16] <+regnilse> depends on the colony, one near me didnt have flush toilets in the 90s in 2010 the had wind turbines and self driving combines
[2022-12-11 08:18:31] <Pimplejewce> maybe that was the influence that made me hate photos hahahah
[2022-12-11 08:18:38] <DavieDonna> Selfie culture is justifying the Hutterite position 100 years later LUL
[2022-12-11 08:18:49] <tipereth6> big true
[2022-12-11 08:19:02] <%+Zmpr0wler> yeah that happened in kansas for our amish and menonites because you need a DL for horse and buggie
[2022-12-11 08:19:07] <%+Destrina> I also hate being photographed, but just because I have low self esteem.
[2022-12-11 08:19:13] <LeprechaunX> They did have an issue with insufficient genetic diversity within their human population in the early 90s
[2022-12-11 08:19:19] <DavieDonna> Adventists are the longest lived people in the United States
[2022-12-11 08:19:50] <LeprechaunX> I see Hutterites at the mall all the time
[2022-12-11 08:20:00] <Fleepflammer> They use religion in any way that it can benefit their community
[2022-12-11 08:20:10] <Fleepflammer> Such as tax breaks and what not as well
[2022-12-11 08:20:18] <Pimplejewce> so interesting how these different sects can form
[2022-12-11 08:20:18] <LeprechaunX> you can tell.cause the.women wear these ugly ass dresses
[2022-12-11 08:20:36] <Zencurse> How dare you not bend over backwards to accommodate my personal choice of faith!
[2022-12-11 08:20:52] <Fleepflammer> Yeah they still pay some, but more or less largely discounted rate
[2022-12-11 08:21:00] <+insidewalk> nobody makes much of an income so there isn't anything to tax, the colony is run as a business and they buy a ton of property/equipment
[2022-12-11 08:21:04] <Zencurse> Don't you want me to be happy?!
[2022-12-11 08:21:23] <Fleepflammer> Hutterites around here are rich as fuck
[2022-12-11 08:21:27] <LeprechaunX> The vanity in my bathroom was made by a local hutterite colony
[2022-12-11 08:21:36] <Fleepflammer> Cause they make all their own everything, and sell anything extra they have
[2022-12-11 08:21:40] <Deleroth> or see them pay for something when they go to a hospital, and they plop down 20k in cash
[2022-12-11 08:21:55] <Fleepflammer> Yeah shit is absolutely wild
[2022-12-11 08:21:57] <+insidewalk> the colony has a huge amount of assets but nobody's swimming in the scrooge mcduck vault
[2022-12-11 08:22:10] <+parallax1s> we have amish country near me and has all kinds of shops, restaurants and stuff
[2022-12-11 08:22:42] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> Gotta respect the hustle
[2022-12-11 08:23:01] <+insidewalk> I keep those spinners on my buggy
[2022-12-11 08:23:37] <%Kardmager> Reminds me how the Mormon church has like over 100Billion
[2022-12-11 08:23:37] <+insidewalk> I was more talking about the colonies that Ive been around in Alberta
[2022-12-11 08:23:38] <%+Zmpr0wler> they use a lot of loop holes with taxes and other things to make money yet hire young english to work for half the pay and treat them like shit
[2022-12-11 08:23:39] <DavieDonna> DatSheffy
[2022-12-11 08:23:41] <H2o_Spez> morning
[2022-12-11 08:24:00] <Fleepflammer> Im in south dakota, most of our reservations are horrifying
[2022-12-11 08:24:02] <mrsatism> my major is homeland security, and the amish response to the pandemic was interesting
[2022-12-11 08:24:04] <LeprechaunX> Hutterites doesn't seem like it here... They make bank but it all goes into the Colony
[2022-12-11 08:24:19] <Crajabzul> The Seminole tribe is incredibly well off, but that's because they built some casinos
[2022-12-11 08:24:24] <mrsatism> the primary agent of help wasnt the government but a womans organization
[2022-12-11 08:24:24] <Zencurse> In general, anything resembling a religion gets far too much leeway in U.S society. its stupid.
[2022-12-11 08:24:29] <mrsatism> womens?
[2022-12-11 08:24:29] <LeprechaunX> The reservations in Northern Ontario are bad
[2022-12-11 08:24:33] <$Nathangnouv> c
[2022-12-11 08:24:33] <DavieDonna> I drove through Montana/South Dakota and my word the reservations there were some of the poorest I've ever seen
[2022-12-11 08:24:42] <Crajabzul> Now they own the Hard Rock franchise.
[2022-12-11 08:25:19] <%+Destrina> Two of the reservations in SD are the poorest counties in the entire US last I read.
[2022-12-11 08:25:27] <LeprechaunX> I've been stopped on theb highway by the RCMP and told to not stop in the reserves on that highway going north or ill lose my car
[2022-12-11 08:25:27] <%Kardmager> Canada and their native treatment is a sad thing
[2022-12-11 08:25:42] [Notification] Yiu113 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! [richHam]
[2022-12-11 08:25:46] <%EpicPumaNess> I don't think I could play this game, simply because of thos the storage looks.... its looks... just crazy
[2022-12-11 08:25:53] <H2o_Spez> its fine any size bedrooms? or dwarfs will cry about to small room?
[2022-12-11 08:26:16] <%EpicPumaNess> other countries are FAR more racist
[2022-12-11 08:26:21] <mrsatism> yup
[2022-12-11 08:26:21] <LeprechaunX> The problem with reservations in Canada is that they don't have self determination
[2022-12-11 08:26:23] <+parallax1s> australia is too I've heard
[2022-12-11 08:26:26] <DavieDonna> America is one of the least racist countries on Earth
[2022-12-11 08:26:27] <%Kardmager> Australia is pretty bad as well
[2022-12-11 08:26:30] <+insidewalk> any country that was colonized is pretty rough
[2022-12-11 08:26:31] <Pimplejewce> yeah its just a different group
[2022-12-11 08:26:43] <%Anandil> we're apparently still at war with them
[2022-12-11 08:26:43] <Zencurse> Manifest destiny! Fk anyone that isn't white. or male. or christian. or straight
[2022-12-11 08:26:43] <%+Zmpr0wler> yes
[2022-12-11 08:26:46] <%$DuranDuranDuran> The Romani in Europe, lol.
[2022-12-11 08:26:48] <%+Yiu113> Literally any European country when you mention Romani people
[2022-12-11 08:26:51] <H2o_Spez> i am from Lithuania. i like your country, not like in EU
[2022-12-11 08:26:53] <%EpicPumaNess> Asian countries are mega racist
[2022-12-11 08:26:55] <Pimplejewce> bring up gypsies in Europe lol
[2022-12-11 08:26:56] <%+Yiu113> @DuranDuranDuran Same brainworms
[2022-12-11 08:26:57] <emptyxD> me as a german can not confirm that :)
[2022-12-11 08:27:09] <+Mikeweber83> NM alot is self inflicted / refusal to leave their own welfare state. that area has been running out of watwr for decades but they wont leave. the govt is building like a multi billion dollar water pipeline to get drinking water to a 300 mile area
[2022-12-11 08:27:12] <LeprechaunX> the aboriginal culture on reserves is so bad and their leadership is extremely corrupt
[2022-12-11 08:27:16] <smilingowl> i as a german concure about that
[2022-12-11 08:27:17] <%$DuranDuranDuran> @Yiu113 get out of my heeeaaad!
[2022-12-11 08:27:20] <mrsatism> also being black is very hard in almost every country
[2022-12-11 08:27:48] <DavieDonna> Europeans are full of self-loathing, especially Germany and Britain

[2022-12-11 08:27:52] <mrsatism> Yeah but germans are allowed to be proud for that 5-0 against brazil
[2022-12-11 08:28:00] <SaucyGiraffe> I just came back, what?
[2022-12-11 08:28:01] <Deleroth> I saw some funny memes about Germany in regards to protecting Ukraine
[2022-12-11 08:28:01] <%+WarpedVulpes> every 2 years
[2022-12-11 08:28:06] <Zencurse> I mean clearly being proud of being German means ur a nazi and worship hitlers jockstrap Kappa
[2022-12-11 08:28:08] <%+WarpedVulpes> Olympics and World Cup
[2022-12-11 08:28:11] <%+Zmpr0wler> i think austrian should be more sorry for hitler
[2022-12-11 08:28:24] <emptyxD> Zencurse want to see my replica?
[2022-12-11 08:28:31] <LeprechaunX> A buddy of mine's dad built houses on reserves in the north in Canada... he said he would build the same house every 5 years because after 5 years they were destroyed
[2022-12-11 08:28:42] <H2o_Spez> history , never liked when i was child... now i love it . all random things that happen . all detals i love to hear
[2022-12-11 08:28:53] <DavieDonna> There's nothing wrong with white cultures
[2022-12-11 08:29:05] <%+Destrina> We had one Latino teacher, Mr. Carillo.
[2022-12-11 08:29:09] <Zencurse> Yeah History was a subject I grew to appreciate more as I got older. hated it in primary
[2022-12-11 08:29:16] <+Shaggyscoots> I had a black 7th grade geography teacher and he was easily one of the best teachers I ever had
[2022-12-11 08:29:22] <SaucyGiraffe> as half black, its all weird
[2022-12-11 08:29:23] <Kamyu2> my entire childhood k-12, not a single non-white kid in the entire school until i hit grade 10
[2022-12-11 08:29:25] <DavieDonna> I think there's a collective fear of white homogeneity that's unfair
[2022-12-11 08:29:37] <tipereth6> thanks to age of empires I always found history fascinating since as young as I can rememeber
[2022-12-11 08:29:40] <$SovietWinter> White culture being attacked again D:
[2022-12-11 08:29:43] <+Shalin13> history is usually only understood once wisdom enters the mix
[2022-12-11 08:29:51] <Ruinkind> Perspective, guys.  Perspective.  A small world view gives you a narrow looking glass.
[2022-12-11 08:29:52] <Pimplejewce> white or black are just kind of nebulous groups, there are wide ranges of different cultures
[2022-12-11 08:29:56] <+Shaggyscoots> @tipereth6 LUL same here
[2022-12-11 08:30:08] <mrsatism> i will say that having a male teacher definitely opened my eyes to any sexism that I already had
[2022-12-11 08:30:11] <+kknitro_> Used to live in Canada, when I moved to Arizona I was extremely surprised by the lack of diversity here.
[2022-12-11 08:30:19] <Zencurse> I was kinda lucky in that respect. my schools growing up were fairly diverse. actually I was in the minority as a caucasian
[2022-12-11 08:30:29] <H2o_Spez> @pimplejewce yea there is more things than this 2
[2022-12-11 08:30:38] <%+WarpedVulpes> @Zencurse Same
[2022-12-11 08:30:49] <SaucyGiraffe> then there is Florida
[2022-12-11 08:31:01] <%EpicPumaNess> Throughout my yyears of school, it was like 80% white, 15% hispanic, and 5% other
[2022-12-11 08:31:02] <+BlackShi> What are you doing with that water @Richard_Hammer ?
[2022-12-11 08:31:22] <H2o_Spez> @blackshi drink?
[2022-12-11 08:31:23] <Pimplejewce> group identity is such an interesting concept
[2022-12-11 08:31:38] <%$Spideycloned> @SaucyGiraffe While this a funny joke, as somoene in Florida the only reason you hear about Florida as much as you do is a thing called "Sunshine laws" where our court records are just extremely extremely public
[2022-12-11 08:31:39] <%EpicPumaNess> what's funny is, same ratio with where I work now
[2022-12-11 08:31:45] <+BlackShi> Nice =]
[2022-12-11 08:31:50] <%$Spideycloned> Most states have some protections against publishing that shit, Florida doesn't
[2022-12-11 08:31:51] <Zencurse> Wow I couldn't imagine that. but I'm from California which has lots of Asian Americans

[2022-12-11 08:32:21] <GNugget1> KKona nothin wrong with that
[2022-12-11 08:32:21] <%ANeerMiss> You also don't like beans, or soup
[2022-12-11 08:32:33] <%+Destrina> @Raptorez Excellent reference.
[2022-12-11 08:32:41] <+kknitro_> I love asian Cuisine noodles and rice go well with everything
[2022-12-11 08:32:41] <tipereth6> I love beans and soups
[2022-12-11 08:32:43] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Chili is the whitest food known to man. You have no excuse.
[2022-12-11 08:32:54] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Wendy's has Chili.
[2022-12-11 08:32:56] <H2o_Spez> enemy brake only builded walls , they cant brake prebuilded rocks?
[2022-12-11 08:32:58] <Pimplejewce> I think the  hamburger invention should be considered American at this point
[2022-12-11 08:32:59] <%Kardmager> Burgers with no onions though
[2022-12-11 08:33:10] <Zencurse> I am white. and I do like chili. probably true
[2022-12-11 08:33:37] <%+Destrina> Chinese food is far and away my favorite.
[2022-12-11 08:33:44] <SaucyGiraffe> thats a good law
[2022-12-11 08:33:50] <tipereth6> Indian food is my favorite
[2022-12-11 08:33:59] <H2o_Spez> i am white and i rly like asian food
[2022-12-11 08:34:01] <Zencurse> I'm a huge sucker for Mexican food
[2022-12-11 08:34:03] <Pimplejewce> burgies are a top tier food
[2022-12-11 08:34:15] <%EpicPumaNess> I think Chinese food is my favorite, but only from certain places
[2022-12-11 08:34:19] <LeprechaunX> I'm quite certain I like Asian style dishes a lot more than my 1/4 Japanese wife
[2022-12-11 08:34:38] <tipereth6> its a western thing for sure
[2022-12-11 08:34:52] <%EpicPumaNess> To be fair, most non-american food in america, has been americanized, not that you can't find the real stuff
[2022-12-11 08:35:11] <H2o_Spez> noodles in korea or japan. its just perfect...
[2022-12-11 08:35:18] <Zencurse> I went to college in Santa Cruz. soooooooo many Mexican food places and they were all just soooooo good
[2022-12-11 08:35:27] <Zencurse> I would recommend to all haha
[2022-12-11 08:35:38] <%+Destrina> I could eat potstickers and other Asian dumplings most meals no problem.
[2022-12-11 08:35:46] <H2o_Spez> ^^^^
[2022-12-11 08:35:48] <%EpicPumaNess> Mexican food is honestly top tier imo, but theres a lot of it where I live
[2022-12-11 08:35:51] <Deleroth> is the roc still there?
[2022-12-11 08:35:59] <%$DuranDuranDuran> God bless our immigrants and their tasty, tasty food.
[2022-12-11 08:36:05] <%EpicPumaNess> @Destrina I would eat myself to death with pot stickers tbh
[2022-12-11 08:36:18] <%EpicPumaNess> favorite food, hands down
[2022-12-11 08:36:29] <Tpocket> a full on bat?
[2022-12-11 08:36:29] <+RitualSauce> like the animal?
[2022-12-11 08:36:29] <SaucyGiraffe> da fuck
[2022-12-11 08:36:32] <tipereth6> i did almost die from potstickers once
[2022-12-11 08:36:32] <Deleroth> with a bat or by a bat
[2022-12-11 08:36:37] <Tpocket> oh
[2022-12-11 08:36:43] <$Markeh04> did it just fly into you?
[2022-12-11 08:36:43] <Deleroth> you said "with a bat"
[2022-12-11 08:36:43] <+insidewalk> inc COVD 69
[2022-12-11 08:36:44] <Tpocket> Both are pretty shocking
[2022-12-11 08:36:46] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> He's got covid. Rip

[2022-12-11 08:36:48] <+RitualSauce> Dick, you had a rabies shot recently? @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-11 08:36:48] <%+Zmpr0wler> idk
[2022-12-11 08:36:49] <CallMeHanna_> morfO
[2022-12-11 08:36:51] <$SovietWinter> Maybe a wiffleball bat
[2022-12-11 08:37:04] <%oxY_tv> Almost hero’s ?
[2022-12-11 08:37:12] <H2o_Spez> so why he kill that dude in game?
[2022-12-11 08:37:16] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Not a very robust tooth.
[2022-12-11 08:37:20] <SaucyGiraffe> how can you be so country and live so north
[2022-12-11 08:37:24] <+RitualSauce> you can get rabies from even microscopic bat scratches. get a shot ASAP...
[2022-12-11 08:37:24] <%+Destrina> If you got bit or scratched at all you should get a rabies shot. If you are infected and it progresses far enough before the shot, you're just 100% dead.
[2022-12-11 08:37:32] <CallMeHanna_> Just make sure you gor your rabies shot
[2022-12-11 08:37:43] <%+Yiu113> Have you heard of the midwest?
[2022-12-11 08:37:46] <tipereth6> its like cat scratch fever, even a slighter perforation of the skin can be lethal
[2022-12-11 08:37:48] <%+Yiu113> Also rural areas?
[2022-12-11 08:37:50] <%$PaperKnight> the more north you go the more south you get

[2022-12-11 08:38:16] <%+Destrina> Seriously jsut get the rabies shot for safety.
[2022-12-11 08:38:16] <Kamyu2> wait, the new rabies shots go in the bite area.  so would that be a jab to the face?
[2022-12-11 08:38:28] <%+Zmpr0wler> rural is rural north south east west

[2022-12-11 08:38:56] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Dude, I had know idea how redneck Michigan was before your storytimes. I thought we had a monopoly on that in the South.
[2022-12-11 08:39:15] <%+Destrina> South Dakota is very redneck too.
[2022-12-11 08:39:21] <SaucyGiraffe> south
[2022-12-11 08:39:43] <Zencurse> I got family from backwater West Virginia. I seemingly get a temporary accent like, by osmosis, whenever I'm forced to visit
[2022-12-11 08:39:48] <%+Zmpr0wler> oh you sweet summer child rural kansas is really redneck

[2022-12-11 08:42:47] <Zencurse> Kinda makes sense I guess. I always felt that way between Cali and Washington
[2022-12-11 08:42:56] <+marinaramaestro> have you had your artifacts stolen yet? And if no where are they?
[2022-12-11 08:43:06] <tipereth6> yeah same Zencurse, they are for sure sister states

[2022-12-11 08:49:19] <smilingowl> there was a tool to build 3 dimensional maps for dwarf fortress
[2022-12-11 08:49:33] <+TheBeerinator> yeah
[2022-12-11 08:49:39] <+TheBeerinator> it was cool af
[2022-12-11 08:49:49] <%$PaperKnight> is there a difficulty setting or is it just one diff
[2022-12-11 08:50:09] <FlobbaBob> just git gud
[2022-12-11 08:50:11] <+TheBeerinator> there are some setting for it
[2022-12-11 08:50:14] <+TheBeerinator> iirc
[2022-12-11 08:50:23] <OwlishViewer> @PaperKnight different biomes are easier or harder
[2022-12-11 08:50:35] <%$PaperKnight> gotcha
[2022-12-11 08:50:45] <Zencurse> From what I've seen, its more u can make decisions that make the game easier or harder but no codified setting
[2022-12-11 08:50:51] <FlobbaBob> what is this horror cave?
[2022-12-11 08:51:01] <Zencurse> I do not own this game and am going strictly from stream viewing
[2022-12-11 08:51:01] <+TheBeerinator> I thought there were economy settings

[2022-12-11 08:52:50] <%+StarThiefAtomsk> Boss level enemy.
[2022-12-11 08:53:04] <thefaint94> they should make a crown engraving of him wearing three crowns and then give him the crown
[2022-12-11 08:53:09] <phillymilksteak> AND he keeps them on his head while wrestling a cave crocodile
[2022-12-11 08:53:19] <smilingowl> wait no health issues?
[2022-12-11 08:53:43] <Zencurse> Excuse me? Do you doubt the dwarf with 3 crowns to take down, literally anything? Clearly you need to work on your understanding of the crown/dwarf/croc hierarchy
[2022-12-11 08:53:48] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> Casually gut punches a crocodile
[2022-12-11 08:53:54] <smilingowl> dwarfs are metal
[2022-12-11 08:54:19] <%ANeerMiss> Gather round children and we'll tell you the tale of the triple crown king and the crocodile
[2022-12-11 08:54:40] <Zencurse> I mean if I woke up one day with not 1, but 3 whole crowns, I too would feel strong enough to take down a croc
[2022-12-11 08:54:52] <+ElectronicMoose> now the question is did that dwarf win several races or is he swedish
[2022-12-11 08:56:13] <%$kuakae> how goes the misting? happy and moist dwarfs?
[2022-12-11 08:56:37] <smilingowl> build an corridor to the subterranian ocean with an fishing hole

[2022-12-11 09:06:08] <%+Destrina> You can encrust arrows with cut glass
[2022-12-11 09:06:47] <LordEmperorPoshKingMarza> Probably makes the arrow a little bit heavier and give it a little more penetration, knowing DF
[2022-12-11 09:06:51] <%+Destrina> Dunno if it does anything, but its an option.
[2022-12-11 09:07:08] <Tpocket> lol I googled dwarf fortress milkable animals out of curiosity. This game is weird.
[2022-12-11 09:07:25] <%+Usinji> You can milk anything if you try hard enough
[2022-12-11 09:07:49] <Mr_Quackums> apparently not gorillas

[2022-12-11 09:08:05] <tipereth6> gotta draw the line somewhere i suppose
[2022-12-11 09:08:23] <tipereth6> modded gorilla milk. thats a phrase I never thought i would read

[2022-12-11 09:41:48] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 09:42:23] <rosio0> i'd say prob for better
[2022-12-11 09:42:59] <CS_Hague> It'd be nice if Rimworld had like 2 more z-levels
[2022-12-11 09:43:06] <$geek2games> thing about DF is it just has SO much content, like, every time I play it I see something new, and I've been playing for like years.
[2022-12-11 09:43:13] <rosio0> I like the intricacies...
[2022-12-11 09:43:25] <+ThatSl1me> Patches or mods should help the tediousness of current steam DF
[2022-12-11 09:43:25] <%hottiefruits> i wouldn't mind copy/paste of designations tbh
[2022-12-11 09:43:58] <rosio0> would you say it's a "hard" game?
[2022-12-11 09:44:28] <CS_Hague> Yeah, I'm hoping that they get the economy working again. When it was working you had to make sure you had low-income housing for dwarfs
[2022-12-11 09:44:31] <$geek2games> @rosio0 complex, not hard. you can make a simple fort no problem, but the deeper you get, the deeper the rabbit hole is.
[2022-12-11 09:44:39] <leviska0> i think they will not get trapped
[2022-12-11 09:44:44] <rosio0> I'm sold
[2022-12-11 09:45:15] <TheDingaling> Misting as in pink mist or
[2022-12-11 09:45:56] <TheDingaling> Can you make one out of booze.
[2022-12-11 09:45:57] <%Lakart> The fort needs more cats
[2022-12-11 09:46:01] <CS_Hague> I saw a picture on Reddit where someone made a picture of Nic cage made of nickel cages
[2022-12-11 09:46:14] <rosio0> D:
[2022-12-11 09:47:02] <leviska0> why still no magma?
[2022-12-11 09:47:02] <emptyxD> smegma
[2022-12-11 09:47:42] <%Lakart> down to goblin town we go
[2022-12-11 09:48:20] <+ThatSl1me> As they say strike the earth and etc.
[2022-12-11 09:49:46] <+Siggenlh> what is this. we are not at war with the elves yet DansGame
[2022-12-11 09:50:11] <H2o_Spez> need help Kappa, dwarf got strange mood and he went to map edge.... i have all workshops builded. what he may want more from me LUL
[2022-12-11 09:50:48] <CS_Hague> There's never been a time where that was considered a bad thing. Not in any media
[2022-12-11 09:50:55] <$Lowallyn> is there more rare stuff that's deeper?
[2022-12-11 09:51:42] <TheDingaling> Thanks, Sting
[2022-12-11 09:51:45] <emptyxD> every breath you take?

[2022-12-11 09:52:31] <$geek2games> @Lowallyn that's one of those things you just have to discover by doing.
[2022-12-11 09:53:19] <$Lowallyn> i hope he finds a balrog or something like that then
[2022-12-11 09:53:48] <$Attckcat> So how deep are we right now? rooPog
[2022-12-11 09:54:38] <leviska0> the papyrus trap from undertale

[2022-12-11 09:56:06] <$Nathangnouv> how many legendary balrogs have you killed so far
[2022-12-11 09:57:36] <CS_Hague> Head Fat Punching is a favored Elvish pastime
[2022-12-11 09:57:54] <!%+krainboltgreene> Richard, I've heard pretty good reviews of Ixion, in that it's hard but not in the illusory difficulty way, instead in a "nihilistic" way.
[2022-12-11 09:58:15] <CS_Hague> Is it ironic to drown in shells?
[2022-12-11 09:58:33] <!%+krainboltgreene> It's a colony manager where you build on the inside of a rotating space ship city.
[2022-12-11 09:58:40] <+ThatSl1me> I wish I could run out of shells
[2022-12-11 09:59:15] <nevermetal> just dig down 3Head
[2022-12-11 09:59:25] <+mxspokes> these graphics are amazing, you can practically see the spikes that menace on the dwarven art
[2022-12-11 09:59:36] <!%+krainboltgreene> I love the dwarves just chilling in the new corridor.
[2022-12-11 10:00:25] <%Lakart> we demand more toads

[2022-12-11 10:01:06] <+ThatSl1me> Spiders are chill
[2022-12-11 10:02:29] <CS_Hague> I'm kinda wondering how they'll implement magic in this. Like if different places will have different spheres and animals will just be born with magical natures from the sphere like, a place attuned to fire and one of your chickens hatches into a firebird

[2022-12-11 10:02:49] <$geek2games> in non-graphical DF you couldn't do anything without the game pausing, not even set mining, so they've improved it a lot.
[2022-12-11 10:03:00] <+ThatSl1me> Is bone carving referring to crafting stuff from bone?
[2022-12-11 10:04:06] <+mxspokes> yes

[2022-12-11 10:05:02] <leviska0> i think you need to go even deeper
[2022-12-11 10:05:09] <%thefaint94> yo, thank you for the sub! ad free again PogChamp
[2022-12-11 10:06:01] <wzrdn> why don't people ever leave their tile
[2022-12-11 10:06:19] <CS_Hague> You mean like raids?
[2022-12-11 10:06:33] <wzrdn> like there is this whole world, but everyone stays in their starting tile
[2022-12-11 10:06:58] <$geek2games> @wzrdn you can send armies out to the rest of the world.
[2022-12-11 10:07:27] <$Attckcat> @wzrdn takes a while to build up your dwarves to go exploring
[2022-12-11 10:07:40] <CS_Hague> Yeah, fortress mode exists in one static place you choose but adventurer mode will let you travel all over the place including to previous forts
[2022-12-11 10:08:18] <babaghanoushy> you can farm the spider silk by putting the spider into a fortification "cage"
[2022-12-11 10:08:24] <CS_Hague> Well, I'm not gonna say it's amazing but there's definitely a lot more to do
[2022-12-11 10:08:26] BAN: babaghanoushy (600s)
[2022-12-11 10:09:27] <wzrdn> can you have multiple fortresses across the world?
[2022-12-11 10:10:07] <CS_Hague> You can retire a fortress and play another and return later
[2022-12-11 10:10:15] <CS_Hague> But time doesn't stay still
[2022-12-11 10:10:22] <%+MrZev> whats the blue stuff next to the gold?
[2022-12-11 10:11:06] <CS_Hague> When your fortress becomes large enough, you will become the capital of your civilization and can start conquering land and adding it to your civilizations holdings
[2022-12-11 10:11:53] <skurke_> Is it true the steam build lacks good combat logs? I think I read some stuff is still not 100% release ready. Still bought it to show support and will play soon :D
[2022-12-11 10:12:11] <CS_Hague> IRL mica makes a pretty good table top
[2022-12-11 10:12:16] <$Butain> dwarf fortress any good?
[2022-12-11 10:12:16] <$geek2games> @skurke_ true.
[2022-12-11 10:12:31] <Dadburry> they were... quite verbose far as i remember
[2022-12-11 10:12:32] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-11 10:12:33] <$geek2games> @Butain it's awesome.
[2022-12-11 10:12:51] <%+MrZev> @Butain if you liked rimworld and wish it was more complicated, then yes
[2022-12-11 10:12:55] <skurke_> You used to be able to investigate corpses and get stories of how they met their demise and it were usually really fun stories
[2022-12-11 10:12:55] <+Shaggyscoots> why you no use auto mine?
[2022-12-11 10:13:32] <+Shaggyscoots> Roger that
[2022-12-11 10:13:41] <Dadburry> dick is stumbling in the dark, everything he done so far is the product of that
[2022-12-11 10:13:45] <Shynsy> !please
[2022-12-11 10:13:45] <@^Moobot> @Shynsy Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.

[2022-12-11 10:14:13] <+Shaggyscoots> You want to know how to auto mine?  it's a good qol tool
[2022-12-11 10:14:23] <wzrdn> he just said he didn't lol
[2022-12-11 10:14:27] <%+Zmpr0wler> !please

[2022-12-11 10:14:38] <%Spurpshub> is the music in game?
[2022-12-11 10:14:45] <Dadburry> yep, theres music in the game
[2022-12-11 10:14:51] <Dadburry> and some of it is... insane
[2022-12-11 10:14:54] <%Spurpshub> and as i say that it goes silent
[2022-12-11 10:14:56] <+Shaggyscoots> you're doing awesome
[2022-12-11 10:14:57] <Dadburry> and really fun
[2022-12-11 10:14:58] <Iqunlimited> you made a waterfall youve earned your badge
[2022-12-11 10:14:59] <%Spurpshub> but this feels cozuy
[2022-12-11 10:15:01] <%Spurpshub> cozy
[2022-12-11 10:15:05] <+Siggenlh> i'd say youre dpiing pretty good with the population number in mind
[2022-12-11 10:15:33] <CS_Hague> Fucking gegologists man
[2022-12-11 10:15:34] <Shynsy> I'm sure I can wait a little longer for a mac release
[2022-12-11 10:15:39] <CS_Hague> *geologists
[2022-12-11 10:15:44] <%Spurpshub> oh right yea full geology ame
[2022-12-11 10:15:50] <%Spurpshub> game. fuck my typing
[2022-12-11 10:15:52] <CS_Hague> You can blame Randy Marsh for this crap
[2022-12-11 10:15:52] <Dadburry> its a game about dorfs, of course theres dozens and dozens of rocks and ores and shit
[2022-12-11 10:17:22] <%+Zmpr0wler> df to me seems that i would like a bit more easier to check referance like rimworld but it has a lot of "depth" to it
[2022-12-11 10:18:25] <%$Spideycloned> I think this game looks awful for me, but I acknowledge its a great "Dick and chill" game
[2022-12-11 10:18:26] <CS_Hague> Well, there's some ores this setting lacks the technology to process. Like bauxite, ilmenite and pitchblende which are aluminum, titanium, and uranium ores
[2022-12-11 10:18:32] <%thefaint94> df sounds like a game that would have a random stone name generator built in so you never run out of new stones
[2022-12-11 10:18:36] <%$Spideycloned> and that makes it a good game
[2022-12-11 10:18:45] <+Siggenlh> lots of chill until it isnt.
[2022-12-11 10:18:51] <TreyFTW> Planned assassination time?
[2022-12-11 10:18:54] <%$Spideycloned> Same with rimworld, honestly
[2022-12-11 10:18:57] <AlienTree> My mayor is a cage addict
[2022-12-11 10:19:01] <AlienTree> I wish he would stop
[2022-12-11 10:19:06] <TreyFTW> Well, I guess planned assassination is redundant
[2022-12-11 10:19:20] <CS_Hague> Yeah, I'd rather my mayor ask me to make cages
[2022-12-11 10:19:34] <+Siggenlh> does Dick have a fave dwarf yet?
[2022-12-11 10:19:39] <wzrdn> "people love our splints, they come here to see our splints, splints are our tradition and our lifeblood"
[2022-12-11 10:19:51] <CS_Hague> Oh shit, the rookery begins
[2022-12-11 10:20:04] <%+Zmpr0wler> sure is more "rocky" than rimworlds 5
[2022-12-11 10:20:07] <%$kuakae> maybe the whole splint thing stems from that time a dwarf fell through the waterfall hole
[2022-12-11 10:20:56] <CS_Hague> "Local Mayor vows 'Never Again' after splint debacle"
[2022-12-11 10:21:31] <AlienTree> Box hoarder
[2022-12-11 10:21:46] <%Lakart> @kuakae One of my very first DF forts every, both my miners fell off the stairs into a multi level cavern and broke their legs
[2022-12-11 10:22:06] <%Lakart> Run over immediately
[2022-12-11 10:22:54] <%Lakart> Because they were crippled in place they refused to let go of the mining picks, so nobody could replace them.

[2022-12-11 10:23:52] <$shumone> whats up with that water there
[2022-12-11 10:24:20] <wzrdn> did I ever tell you about the time I got misted
[2022-12-11 10:25:04] <CS_Hague> I can't remember, there's a season elves always show up in.
[2022-12-11 10:25:07] <%Lakart> Fall? I think the trade caravan always comes at the end of fall
[2022-12-11 10:25:20] <%Lakart> Because the popup always talks about winter coming soon
[2022-12-11 10:25:55] <CS_Hague> Do they count mushroom trees?
[2022-12-11 10:25:58] <%Lakart> Maybe you should just eat all the elves
[2022-12-11 10:26:11] <%+scottish1900> Wait what is this an actual cave underground?
[2022-12-11 10:26:17] <%Lakart> Ya
[2022-12-11 10:26:20] <+Siggenlh> are they weed elves.? do they even care about shrromtrees?
[2022-12-11 10:26:28] <%+scottish1900> Dwarf Fortress is nuts I thought it was just solid all the way down
[2022-12-11 10:26:33] <%Lakart> A mushroom forest is still a forest =P
[2022-12-11 10:26:44] <CS_Hague> No it's not. It's not even a plant
[2022-12-11 10:26:45] <TreyFTW> They got their eyes on wood of all kinds
[2022-12-11 10:27:00] <%Lakart> @scottish1900 narp, I was just talking about losing one of my first games by both my miners digging down into a cavern like this, falling, and breaking their legs.
[2022-12-11 10:27:00] <wzrdn> myconids aren't wood
[2022-12-11 10:27:03] <+Siggenlh> better kill a few squads than lose the fort lUL

[2022-12-11 10:27:43] <wzrdn> they are gonna do a violence

[2022-12-11 10:27:54] <%+scottish1900> It's fine they are nerd elves, nerd elves are no threat tbh
[2022-12-11 10:28:02] <%Lakart> They'll show you how much they love wood by using steel to kill you instead richLUL
[2022-12-11 10:28:14] <CS_Hague> @scottish1900 Hide on the surface and periodically shoot your woodcutter and run away before you can catch them
[2022-12-11 10:28:29] <%+Yiu113> They extract their wood ethically
[2022-12-11 10:28:35] <$shumone> sounds like they got a wood monopoly going on
[2022-12-11 10:28:37] <%Lakart> They could be those sissy elves that sing the wood out of the trees like Eragon
[2022-12-11 10:28:40] <CS_Hague> Yeah, something about singing to the trees
[2022-12-11 10:28:42] <%+scottish1900> I mean, that doesn't sound like a problem really if you just don't cut down stuff outside of your walled in area
[2022-12-11 10:28:43] <!%RevBanger> I like wood

[2022-12-11 10:29:22] <%+scottish1900> Do you think they would buy it if we said we asked the trees if they minded being cut down and took no answer as them not minding
[2022-12-11 10:29:32] <%Lakart> @wzrdn Dwarves: "I got the tree's persimmons" richLUL
[2022-12-11 10:29:58] <%+scottish1900> "We asked the trees if they didn't want to be cut down, they didn't say anything so they don't mind"

[2022-12-11 10:30:13] <%Lakart> Man I don't think I've eaten a persimmon in at least 10-15 years

[2022-12-11 10:33:59] <%Lakart> That's literally it
[2022-12-11 10:34:20] <emptyxD> did the water stop flow?
[2022-12-11 10:34:24] <%Lakart> Birds fucking steal all the time
[2022-12-11 10:34:26] <%Lakart> Cunts
[2022-12-11 10:34:34] <emptyxD> ok  xD
[2022-12-11 10:35:14] <CS_Hague> "Hammerers" is filmed live with the dwarfs of law enforcement
[2022-12-11 10:36:31] <NGraak> LUL
[2022-12-11 10:36:44] <CS_Hague> That's what appears to have happened.
[2022-12-11 10:36:45] <+k_nord> LUL seems like it
[2022-12-11 10:36:53] <%flawed_ghost> hate when that happens
[2022-12-11 10:36:55] <%+furiousfarter> rich7
[2022-12-11 10:37:07] <$geek2games> that happens, other dwarfs do indeed steal the step ladders.
[2022-12-11 10:37:09] <+Shaggyscoots> cut that evil tree down
[2022-12-11 10:37:15] <Blind_fires> Call the fire department
[2022-12-11 10:37:16] <$geek2games> chopping down the tree is the way xD
[2022-12-11 10:37:21] <!%RevBanger> It happens sometimes
[2022-12-11 10:38:53] <CS_Hague> I think maybe they got scared and climbed the tree to get away from something and then normal walking pathfinding doesn't let them climb down again
[2022-12-11 10:39:05] <%Alienbob5> is our fortress full of dwarves?
[2022-12-11 10:39:21] <wzrdn> full? no. we can fit more.
[2022-12-11 10:39:44] <ugahbuga> ayoo
[2022-12-11 10:40:13] <%+Zmpr0wler> does it ever max number of dwarves or can you make more room
[2022-12-11 10:40:46] <CS_Hague> There is a max number set in the game files but that's only for migrants, dwarfs will continue to have children beyond that limit
[2022-12-11 10:41:28] <wzrdn> the problem of course is the dwarven fertility cliff, too much pollution
[2022-12-11 10:41:59] <%Lakart> Look at this guy named Dick judging people over here smh
[2022-12-11 10:42:05] <Dadburry> they like the feel of the wind
[2022-12-11 10:42:12] <!%Calastigro> Can if they want
[2022-12-11 10:42:26] <CS_Hague> A dress is just half way to a snuggie
[2022-12-11 10:42:42] <%Lakart> Robes would be the dress equivalent, not vests
[2022-12-11 10:42:47] <%Lakart> =P
[2022-12-11 10:42:47] <%PUPHEAD> dress and vest what peak of fashion
[2022-12-11 10:42:57] <$geek2games> kilts man xD
[2022-12-11 10:43:01] <wzrdn> if they all do it it's not weird
[2022-12-11 10:43:45] <wzrdn> wait till he hears about "dress shoes"

[2022-12-11 10:44:18] <r3nko_> Why is one Forge blue?
[2022-12-11 10:44:30] <CS_Hague> Portal is just the word for a door made of glass
[2022-12-11 10:45:00] <wzrdn> do dwarves have a conception of the afterlife
[2022-12-11 10:45:00] <%Lakart> When I think dude in a dress I just think homer simpson in the mumu or people in the middle east & asia who wear those light weight dress like shirts
[2022-12-11 10:45:11] <tipereth6> they certainly pray alot
[2022-12-11 10:45:16] <%Lakart> @wzrdn sort of
[2022-12-11 10:45:30] <%Lakart> They have their own gods and they get salty if you don't bury them right
[2022-12-11 10:45:52] <!%Calastigro> Vials and tubes? Can you artificially inseminate dwarves?
[2022-12-11 10:46:02] <CS_Hague> @wzrdn They get upset if they don't have a burial plot of some sort and mistreated remains can become g-g-ghosts
[2022-12-11 10:46:43] <wzrdn> g  ... g ... g g g ... GHOSTS???
[2022-12-11 10:46:55] <%Lakart> Easy there shaggy

[2022-12-11 11:03:15] <Eveanore> im sorry a 100 MILE wide bird?????
[2022-12-11 11:03:38] <Ryan_Cairns> yeah a whale eating bird lol
[2022-12-11 11:03:40] <Eveanore> holy shit
[2022-12-11 11:03:53] <PossiblyBri> Sounds about right
[2022-12-11 11:04:04] <Eveanore> did the bird take up the whole screen or just one small square?
[2022-12-11 11:04:04] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 11:04:06] <+EngineOfCreation> Magic? In my christian video game?
[2022-12-11 11:04:07] <PossiblyBri> I cant math so i wont question the math
[2022-12-11 11:04:09] <wzrdn> sounds like you're ... winging it
[2022-12-11 11:05:08] <PossiblyBri> Pretty fuckin' big
[2022-12-11 11:05:26] <wzrdn> birds are hollow so, it's all relative
[2022-12-11 11:05:56] <%Fanrogh> a blue whale is 30 meters or something like that
[2022-12-11 11:06:08] <%Fanrogh> thats about 90-100 feet
[2022-12-11 11:06:36] <+NullpointerGames> so is this like fortnite but for small people?
[2022-12-11 11:07:06] <PossiblyBri> Bald eagles only get to be 14 pounds at max healthy weight and theyre huge. The thought is terrifying.
[2022-12-11 11:07:14] <%+Destrina> Not even kinda @NullpointerGames
[2022-12-11 11:07:22] <+OldLemonSan> how much miasma did the Roc end up giving}
[2022-12-11 11:08:14] <PossiblyBri> Its just rotting away generalemuLaugh
[2022-12-11 11:08:18] <Iqunlimited> beeg
[2022-12-11 11:08:41] <mii_irl> for scale 100 miles is bigger than the state of Connecticut
[2022-12-11 11:08:44] <+OldLemonSan> big is almost an understatement
[2022-12-11 11:08:44] <%Lakart> @PossiblyBri Most of the big birds are scavengers
[2022-12-11 11:09:03] <+OldLemonSan> 272 grams is a bald eagle skeleton
[2022-12-11 11:09:22] <%Lakart> Bald Eagles are basically glorified seagulls
[2022-12-11 11:09:32] <%Lakart> The big birds I was referring to are bigger than bald eagles lol
[2022-12-11 11:09:32] <PossiblyBri> A lot scavenge but most are active hunting predators
[2022-12-11 11:09:42] <Robocurious> "The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish"
[2022-12-11 11:09:50] <%+Yiu113> ~453 grams in a pound (I'm rounding down)
[2022-12-11 11:09:54] <%+Yiu113> How many pounds is this
[2022-12-11 11:09:56] <%Lakart> @Robocurious Glorified seagull
[2022-12-11 11:09:58] <+elan_o7> wait is this the "bald eagle eat a whale" story from like 10 years ago?
[2022-12-11 11:10:09] <%Lakart> They even SOUND like seagulls
[2022-12-11 11:10:20] <Robocurious> seagulls dont catch fish with their talons...
[2022-12-11 11:10:31] <+elan_o7> where the "whale" was a baby porpoise carcass on the beach?
[2022-12-11 11:10:36] <%Lakart> @elan_o7 nah a Roc was what attacked his fort
[2022-12-11 11:10:36] <tipereth6> I watched a nature documentary about an eagle family where in order to survive one young eagle devoured the body of its brother
[2022-12-11 11:10:52] <+OldLemonSan> how much did the skeleton weigh there? 3.7 tons?
[2022-12-11 11:10:58] <%Lakart> @tipereth6 animals are super cannibally tbh
[2022-12-11 11:10:58] <Robocurious> "Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds." they eat seagulls
[2022-12-11 11:11:06] <wzrdn> @elan_o7 what is the porpoise of this line of questioning
[2022-12-11 11:11:07] <+elan_o7> @elan_o7 ahh, makes more sense :D
[2022-12-11 11:11:08] <%+Destrina> Maybe it was jut cranky.
[2022-12-11 11:11:14] <%Lakart> @Robocurious So do Pelicans lmao
[2022-12-11 11:11:23] <Robocurious> so?
[2022-12-11 11:11:24] <tipereth6> they had the nest filmed and these specifc eagels were banded
[2022-12-11 11:11:27] <PossiblyBri> I see them regularly where i live hunting next to the freeways. The oldest recorded bald eagle was killed chasing a rabbit 15 minutes from me 4Head
[2022-12-11 11:11:55] <+OldLemonSan> that's around 13.9 million bald eagle skeleton pile you have there
[2022-12-11 11:11:55] <%Lakart> @Robocurious So eating a seagull isn't some high bar that makes me not call them glorified seagulls when they both sound like them and eat like them
[2022-12-11 11:12:10] <Robocurious> ok your just arguing to argue
[2022-12-11 11:12:17] <PossiblyBri> Seagulls are terrors and i will never go to lake ontario to eat outside again
[2022-12-11 11:12:23] <%+Yiu113> By very rough math, that bird would need to eat about 4 tons of food a day to survive
[2022-12-11 11:12:30] <%+Yiu113> Give or take a ton
[2022-12-11 11:12:47] <%Lakart> A whale a day keeps the doctor away richLUL
[2022-12-11 11:12:51] <%+Yiu113> Way more than 4 tons.
[2022-12-11 11:12:58] <%+Yiu113> Like 40 tons
[2022-12-11 11:13:01] <%Lakart> @Robocurious Says the guy arguing I can't call them glorified seagulls lmao
[2022-12-11 11:13:03] <tipereth6> in a world of Megafauna that may have been actually possible
[2022-12-11 11:13:11] <%Fanrogh> blue whale is 130-150 tons
[2022-12-11 11:13:19] <Eveanore> and necromancy is the only school of magic they've implemented from what I heard right?
[2022-12-11 11:13:23] <Robocurious> that doesnt make sense LuL
[2022-12-11 11:13:28] <PossiblyBri> But how much do we think of the whale is actually edible
[2022-12-11 11:13:37] <+OldLemonSan> oh the question before, 5-6% of a bald eagles weight is it's skeleton
[2022-12-11 11:13:51] <tipereth6> quite a lot of the whale is useful
[2022-12-11 11:13:54] <%+Yiu113> @OldLemonSan Conveniently, about the same weight as it needs to eat a day.
[2022-12-11 11:13:59] <%Lakart> @Eveanore Magic overhaul is 1-3 more "major" updates away
[2022-12-11 11:14:31] <wzrdn> @PossiblyBri I ate a piece of whale in iceland and it turned me vegetarian

[2022-12-11 11:14:33] <%Lakart> I forget what the exact order is
[2022-12-11 11:14:36] <Eveanore> I'd love to see what else they implement if necromancer is this crazy
[2022-12-11 11:14:43] <Eveanore> necromancy*
[2022-12-11 11:14:48] <Eveanore> and that's my favorite kind of magic too
[2022-12-11 11:15:03] <PossiblyBri> Bald eagle is now the unit of measurement of this channel
[2022-12-11 11:15:51] <%Lakart> Peregrine Falcons were the "cool bird" of my childhood
[2022-12-11 11:15:56] <%Lakart> They go zoom
[2022-12-11 11:15:59] <wzrdn> you can thank environmental regulations for making eagles not cool
[2022-12-11 11:16:00] <$Lowallyn> bald eagles are just really big, i dunno about cool
[2022-12-11 11:16:14] <PossiblyBri> Red tailed hawks >
[2022-12-11 11:16:14] <%Lakart> BALD eagles
[2022-12-11 11:16:21] <%Lakart> Not all eagles
[2022-12-11 11:16:43] <$Lowallyn> the american bird
[2022-12-11 11:16:44] <%Lakart> The one that sounds like a seagull, lives around water bodies, and eats fish? Yeah
[2022-12-11 11:16:47] <%Lakart> Specifically that one
[2022-12-11 11:16:52] <wzrdn> you know you take out one letter and you get "bad eagles"
[2022-12-11 11:17:07] <BottomDefilingPupil> Yeah bald eagles aren't me
[2022-12-11 11:17:17] <!%Calastigro> By my math, that bird was really only like 300 to 500 foot wide
[2022-12-11 11:17:33] <Bloodybeerman79> Mornin @richard_hammer and chat how goes it
[2022-12-11 11:17:37] <+beararsed> seaguls are worse than pigeons, they are far more confident
[2022-12-11 11:17:43] <Quillmina> We can easily solve this. Does a bald eagle go "MINE MINE MINE"? If no, not a seagull, if yes ...
[2022-12-11 11:17:43] <wzrdn> what happens if the necromancer resurrects the 1 mile bird
[2022-12-11 11:17:47] <%thefaint94> gotta go by volume tho, not width
[2022-12-11 11:18:09] <PossiblyBri> Lets all be honest... birds are a myth. generalemuLaugh
[2022-12-11 11:18:10] <%+Yiu113> Bald eagles are maybe 6.5 foot wingspan.
[2022-12-11 11:18:19] <%+Yiu113> But weight scales *much* faster than width
[2022-12-11 11:18:29] <+masonicarchitect> Anyone know if giants will break cages? Managed to trap a legendary giant attacking me in a sandstone cage
[2022-12-11 11:19:13] <Eveanore> honestly your elves practically killed a god
[2022-12-11 11:19:15] <%+Yiu113> About 1700 times the size
[2022-12-11 11:19:16] <+masonicarchitect> But the dwarves won't move the caged giant and not sure how I can kill it
[2022-12-11 11:19:16] <+OldLemonSan> 13 million
[2022-12-11 11:19:22] <+OldLemonSan> I said 13
[2022-12-11 11:19:23] <%+Yiu113> If we use 3 million
[2022-12-11 11:19:32] <+OldLemonSan> 3.7 tons into 242 grams
[2022-12-11 11:19:36] <%+Destrina> Any time a creature doubles in size it usually is 8 time heavier
[2022-12-11 11:19:40] <wzrdn> seagle
[2022-12-11 11:19:47] <ZanielGa> It's the weekend. Why are we actually doing math?
[2022-12-11 11:20:01] <Eveanore> Big agree :DDDDDDDD
[2022-12-11 11:20:23] <%+Yiu113> In that case it's about 500 times bigger
[2022-12-11 11:20:29] <!%Calastigro> here's how i figured it, when something gets twice as big in linear measurements, it gets 8 times heavier, so it takes 8^5 times the weight of an eagle to make the weight of the roc
[2022-12-11 11:20:36] <!%Calastigro> so the roc is 2^5 times wider
[2022-12-11 11:20:40] <%$eSaltcracker> 3-6kg weight of bald eagle -> 58000KG/4.5KG = 12.888 bald eagles
[2022-12-11 11:20:50] <YamiCorvus> i came late, and just now discovering this whole ass convo is caused by dwarf fortress?? what
[2022-12-11 11:21:04] <+OldLemonSan> @Richard_Hammer I typed in way wring, 15.000 is it
[2022-12-11 11:21:21] <Eveanore> @YamiCorvus basically there was a Roc that weighed 58k kilos and folks are trying to figure out how big it would actually be
[2022-12-11 11:21:35] <%$eSaltcracker> oh yeah its 12888 so not like 12,
[2022-12-11 11:21:37] <Eveanore> also worth noting that apparently punched this giant ass bird to death in the head
[2022-12-11 11:21:51] <YamiCorvus> @Eveanore ahh thank you, that explains a lot actually haha
[2022-12-11 11:22:13] <+beararsed> what did the bird look like in game?
[2022-12-11 11:22:18] <+beararsed> was it still 1 tile?
[2022-12-11 11:22:24] <Eveanore> it was yea
[2022-12-11 11:22:25] <wzrdn> the biggest and most dangerous kind of eagle in the world is the steven s'eagle
[2022-12-11 11:22:25] <$jackjm> Was it a flying bird? Or like, a giant Ostrich
[2022-12-11 11:22:32] <+beararsed> lol
[2022-12-11 11:22:37] <!%Calastigro> we're talking 1-2 football fields wide, still super fucking massive
[2022-12-11 11:22:46] <$jackjm> I do know what a Roc is LUL
[2022-12-11 11:22:46] <!%Calastigro> plenty big enough to swoop up elephants
[2022-12-11 11:22:52] <Ghulmeister> a rock is an actor
[2022-12-11 11:23:01] <+DionysusLemur> fret dragging
[2022-12-11 11:23:03] <BottomDefilingPupil> a slide?
[2022-12-11 11:23:04] <$ThriftyPlays> !please
[2022-12-11 11:23:05] <@^Moobot> @ThriftyPlays Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-11 11:23:10] <CarlNicola> The vape slide
[2022-12-11 11:23:15] <Coylie3> Wow what a conversation to tune in to! LUL
[2022-12-11 11:23:22] <YamiCorvus> LUL
[2022-12-11 11:23:23] <$MadxChief> but WHY
[2022-12-11 11:23:26] <BottomDefilingPupil> kinky
[2022-12-11 11:23:29] <Eveanore> LMAO
[2022-12-11 11:24:45] <+OldLemonSan> btw, it just occurred to me that according to this game's logic, some furniture takes up more squares than a 58 ton Roc lol
[2022-12-11 11:24:45] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-11 11:25:09] <+MaiCedere> toy stuff is for dwarven children I think
[2022-12-11 11:27:02] <Eveanore> @OldLemonSan yea sadly the game doesen't seem to scale creature size at all
[2022-12-11 11:27:16] <Eveanore> its kinda hilarious seeing that giant bird only taking up one square lol
[2022-12-11 11:27:17] <KarmaDEon> nofMuted
[2022-12-11 11:27:21] <Eveanore> when its practically god sized
[2022-12-11 11:27:46] <wzrdn> muted?
[2022-12-11 11:27:53] <ToasterWings> you are more quiet than jerma in many jerma years vs the website
[2022-12-11 11:27:58] <+Kederawyn> muted for me
[2022-12-11 11:28:03] <ToasterWings> this is true but it's also my setup
[2022-12-11 11:28:15] <+asleepycamper> muted
[2022-12-11 11:28:16] <Coylie3> did the twitch player break when the ad played or did he mute himself?
[2022-12-11 11:28:16] <+OldLemonSan> in the game's defense, maybe the Roc was ridiculously tall and slim with wings like Tiny T-rex hands
[2022-12-11 11:28:46] <Coylie3> Some people are saying "muted" but some are chatting like they can hear him, I think the ad broke something. F5 everyone who can't hear
[2022-12-11 11:29:05] <+Kederawyn> I just F5, didn't work
[2022-12-11 11:29:15] <+OldLemonSan> sometimes, when people don't speak, you can't hear them
[2022-12-11 11:29:28] <wzrdn> sometimes
[2022-12-11 11:29:31] <+Kederawyn> Can't hear anything dude
[2022-12-11 11:29:42] <%$eSaltcracker> for me its just rly quiet you can hear some dangeling noises in the backgo
[2022-12-11 11:29:44] <+OldLemonSan> oh wait, it's everything, xD
[2022-12-11 11:29:45] <%$eSaltcracker> background
[2022-12-11 11:29:47] <%dream_unskilled> this game hates me, I just got wrecked by giant ravens and now theres giant coyotes LUL
[2022-12-11 11:30:08] <ToasterWings> no it's my audio issue but you're super quiet always
[2022-12-11 11:30:11] <+Kederawyn> Sometimes when games makes noises, you can't hear it Kappa
[2022-12-11 11:30:29] <Coylie3> THERE we go, its all good
[2022-12-11 11:30:39] <ToasterWings> oh shit I hear your
[2022-12-11 11:31:13] <ToasterWings> so jerma was always quiet as hell vs twitch
[2022-12-11 11:31:22] <+PsNornagest> have we delved too greedily and too deep yet?
[2022-12-11 11:31:37] <+OldLemonSan> how many times has your Fortress been destroyed and you had to begin a new?
[2022-12-11 11:32:07] <+Kederawyn> How is this game?
[2022-12-11 11:32:46] <+OldLemonSan> it's a massive game that's for sure
[2022-12-11 11:33:16] <ToasterWings> back in the day dick hammer streams are always chill but like my opinion is more volume
[2022-12-11 11:33:19] <+Kederawyn> Yeah, been wanting to check it out.
[2022-12-11 11:35:39] <ToasterWings> your dorf fort is pretty cool
[2022-12-11 11:35:39] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-11 11:37:16] <LungaFermata> the dwarves apparently
[2022-12-11 11:37:17] <ToasterWings> with games like a ton of depth I think "is it DCS and I need to check the engines six ways before takeoff"
[2022-12-11 11:37:52] <ToasterWings> this is more approachable
[2022-12-11 11:38:28] <wzrdn> plates
[2022-12-11 11:38:31] <!%Calastigro> ornate goblets, so you can die like the roman empire
[2022-12-11 11:38:45] <wzrdn> paint on all cookware
[2022-12-11 11:38:47] <LungaFermata> pipes if available
[2022-12-11 11:38:55] <!%Calastigro> lead poisoning had a lot to do with it
[2022-12-11 11:39:08] <+PsNornagest> lead bed redemption 2
[2022-12-11 11:39:09] <+Seriack> Does lead affect dwarves, though? cirThink
[2022-12-11 11:39:20] <wzrdn> first it makes you war more, then it makes you lose
[2022-12-11 11:39:24] <!%Calastigro> heavy metals only make dwarves stronger
[2022-12-11 11:39:34] <LungaFermata> you could make the grates for misting out of lead
[2022-12-11 11:39:45] <!%Calastigro> speaking of which, anyone remember Heavy Metal magazine? is that still a thing?
[2022-12-11 11:40:41] <ToasterWings> I've been watching DF before my studies were done, the heavy metals are good for blunt dmg?
[2022-12-11 11:41:07] <!%Calastigro> oh yeah, a lead mace?
[2022-12-11 11:41:09] <wzrdn> a blunt can't hurt you
[2022-12-11 11:41:33] <Xenowarrior17> worms in your feet
[2022-12-11 11:41:48] <wzrdn> yeah that's called ringworm
[2022-12-11 11:41:50] <ToasterWings> In rimworld no shoes?
[2022-12-11 11:42:19] <ToasterWings> I don't think that's a thing
[2022-12-11 11:42:56] <Murderbydeath> my first fortress just fell to vampires and wereapes
[2022-12-11 11:43:00] <Murderbydeath> I wish you the best, Dick
[2022-12-11 11:43:06] <!%Calastigro> whereas in this game you're stressing about the durability of socks
[2022-12-11 11:43:11] <ToasterWings> I dunno DF tho at all and I need to piss, been watching your streams a bit tho

[2022-12-11 11:46:21] <Xenowarrior17> well that's nice that they're covered. I hate knee walls
[2022-12-11 11:46:54] <Xenowarrior17> I had like 3-4 ft ones in my first apartment on all the usable wall space.
[2022-12-11 11:47:31] <Xenowarrior17> It's free real estate
[2022-12-11 11:47:35] <ToasterWings> I have no family and that seems like a real trip
[2022-12-11 11:47:56] <ToasterWings> but you may not die alone if you're lucky
[2022-12-11 11:48:25] <widsz> kill troll first
[2022-12-11 11:49:01] <wzrdn> start a petition to form a committee to create a resolution on exploring policy alternatives to dealing with the troll

[2022-12-11 11:49:52] <ToasterWings> I'm sorry that was crazy but you got that over me
[2022-12-11 11:49:55] <$Lowallyn> is the world as big as the minimap? then you can dive deeper? or can you infinitely scroll past the minimap
[2022-12-11 11:50:21] <%+Destrina> The map you're on is as big as the minimap but with a ton of Z levels
[2022-12-11 11:50:39] <Murderbydeath> you can build on other maps, too, in the same world, technically
[2022-12-11 11:50:45] <Murderbydeath> just not in the same game
[2022-12-11 11:50:48] <wzrdn> daddy where do elves come from
[2022-12-11 11:50:53] <%+Destrina> This map is a small part of a bigger overworld though.
[2022-12-11 11:50:53] <ic3b3am> Hello Dick & chat! How old is this big ass fortress?
[2022-12-11 11:51:08] <$Lowallyn> oh is it? that's kinda neat that there's an even bigger overworld
[2022-12-11 11:51:18] <Murderbydeath> the actual world is very very large yeah
[2022-12-11 11:51:26] <Murderbydeath> you just get to build on a tiny chunk of it

[2022-12-11 11:56:03] <timdotcom> whoa, nice dorm area! when i used to play, i used to use "quick fort" (i think its called) to automate/repeat little things like that. has this steam version brought about any built-in improvements for that kind of stuff?
[2022-12-11 11:56:03] <ic3b3am> What's the most strange/exotic creature you've trained? Ever? @Richard_Hammer
