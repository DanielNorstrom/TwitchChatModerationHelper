[2023-01-05 13:58:36] <kestas158> you see that junkrat who got hooked across the map was out of position because he played and got punished appropriatly #BASED
[2023-01-05 13:58:42] <%slackanishu> people who hate on hog are just fat phobic
[2023-01-05 13:58:42] <JoyStickAbuser> the hog hook rework now rapidly spins the person hooked and makes them dizzy ig and irl
[2023-01-05 13:58:43] <%TriangleSqrt> df meta > hog meta
[2023-01-05 13:58:51] <%BlitzVolfe> He deserves that much hate from every role

[2023-01-05 14:00:25] <+chaosbyte_> Kiriko is just annoying
[2023-01-05 14:00:37] <+chaosbyte_> cleanse should be a target-thing that only affects one player

[2023-01-05 14:00:56] <lalexlll215> to be fair as a mercy i hate his existence but...
[2023-01-05 14:01:01] <%BlitzVolfe> The splash radius is huge
[2023-01-05 14:01:14] <+eren_t_> i think hog is underpowered right now i think he should be given 2 heal charges
[2023-01-05 14:01:23] <+chaosbyte_> I wouldnt mind if suzu was applied like nanoboost

[2023-01-05 14:02:01] <+chaosbyte_> Imagine hog with full-auto hooks
[2023-01-05 14:02:05] <+eren_t_> 2 ult charges tho would be good
[2023-01-05 14:02:16] <%TriangleSqrt> hook and headling should be on the same cooldown, u have to chose
[2023-01-05 14:02:19] <%slackanishu> @eren_t_ maybe perma e active?
[2023-01-05 14:02:27] <+eren_t_> hmmmm
[2023-01-05 14:02:37] <+eren_t_> yes but he still keeps dual shotgun
[2023-01-05 14:02:46] <kestas158> imagine if he could actually just click shift and randomly pull you out from nowhere and one shot you
[2023-01-05 14:02:47] <+chaosbyte_> Nah idk how to change hog
[2023-01-05 14:02:48] <%+revan_93> Based
[2023-01-05 14:02:52] <JoyStickAbuser> hog should keep his 700hp and add 300 armor
[2023-01-05 14:02:56] <+chaosbyte_> i feel like if you remove hogs oneshot you destroy the heros identity

[2023-01-05 14:04:40] <JoyStickAbuser> the hog rework should now make him a mobility tank OMEGALUL cause all the disabled people play him

[2023-01-05 14:09:12] <JoyStickAbuser> @Gaelicanz no they should give him an ability where he can slide and jump high for verticality and have his secondary ult be a railgun, keep the hook
[2023-01-05 14:09:23] <%TriangleSqrt> @bear_bearow at least it would be more balanced
[2023-01-05 14:09:39] VIEWERS: 163
[2023-01-05 14:09:49] <+chaosbyte_> No they should make it so that hog E encrypts the hard drives of all enemies in the lobby and they have to pay blizzard to unlock them
[2023-01-05 14:09:59] <+Gaelicanz> @Gaelicanz very good, could also make his heal last forever as long as he's near enemies
[2023-01-05 14:10:10] <%TriangleSqrt> @TriangleSqrt its a punishment tool for bad positioning, at least supposed to be?
[2023-01-05 14:10:22] <JoyStickAbuser> the e should also expose all users sms that they had to give up to blizzard
