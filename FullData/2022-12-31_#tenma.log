[2022-12-31 14:53:28] <+Murphyx217> Here, some use babies on the light stops, They drug the baby to keep it sleepy while the woman goes car after car asking for money, with the baby on hands
[2022-12-31 14:53:29] <+ThatAspieLife> Being a disabled person living in the UK I will end up homeless eventually I think.

[2022-12-31 14:56:43] <addpurr> i think that being rude to people who help you is terrible behavior, but i heard that for homeless people money is more important than food, and it's a prejudice that they would spend it on drugs
