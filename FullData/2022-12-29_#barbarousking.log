[2022-12-29 00:50:47] <@%$Kindredmsg> nope. We never get an inside scoop. Once in a super blue moon do mods know something you don't when it comes up upcoming games.

[2022-12-29 01:27:57] <%+Radiosurgery> So if you're too slow the monsters will just be too big to beat. If you're too fast you won't be equipped to kill the boss.

[2022-12-29 01:28:31] <%+Radiosurgery> Speed in terms of how fast you place tiles I mean. If you instantly dump all your tiles you won't get big enough

[2022-12-29 01:35:02] <Pedrw1884> @barbarousking just an fyi, placing rocks around an already formed mountain still gives you the same bonus of building another mountain, but one less harpy nest

[2022-12-29 02:04:14] <@%$DanTheVP> The terrain gives you resources and spawns enemies so you can fight and level up
[2022-12-29 02:04:25] <biggestbrainedratman> this song is the best one
[2022-12-29 02:04:26] <MattKun> @the_awsm1 the terrain effects your stats and such

[2022-12-29 02:51:16] <%+ben82081> it is barely an exaggeration to say that skele level is the only stat that matters on necro
[2022-12-29 02:51:19] <tmi_guy> pretty sure Necro is the class i ended up picking the most
[2022-12-29 02:51:20] <majesticfail> necro is super strong early very weak late
[2022-12-29 02:51:33] <benchjuice> did you know there's a skeleton inside you
[2022-12-29 02:51:37] <%+lordsynth> skeleton level is so so important or else your skeletons just get owned instantly

[2022-12-29 02:52:03] <BobBiscuit> @benchjuice You think with your brain, and it's inside a skeleton. So, really, you're trapped inside a skeleton.

[2022-12-29 02:52:13] <%danzoshdd> you can use 2 rings
[2022-12-29 02:52:15] <$delta_rayne> is speed at which you output skeletons
[2022-12-29 02:52:16] <%Tirist24> it applies to summoning them
[2022-12-29 02:52:19] <%zipperslol> This isn't really that unique of a game. Mr Pibbles Wild Adventure in 2004 did the same thing.
[2022-12-29 02:52:20] <$Xelaxon> i think attack speed is summon speed

[2022-12-29 03:00:47] <%+DayAtTheShrine> what is the difference between skeleton quality and skeleton level?
[2022-12-29 03:01:02] <Deepsearolypoly> quality makes them special boys
[2022-12-29 03:01:09] <%+TalonXV> quality summons different skeletons if I remember right
[2022-12-29 03:01:12] <%rabidwombat311> Quality gives warriors and tanks
[2022-12-29 03:01:12] <%+TalonXV> level is just level
[2022-12-29 03:01:13] <%+ZendoRin> Skeleteon quality is the kind of skelly.
[2022-12-29 03:01:13] <%$GlaceonYo> Level = more damage and hp, Quality is upgraded skeleton type
[2022-12-29 03:01:14] <%DeweyWynn> Level is overall power. Quality is the different types of units

[2022-12-29 03:12:31] <%+UraniumQ33> and you have more skeletons so they have more targets to attack

[2022-12-29 03:13:35] <NugKnight> means more hp

[2022-12-29 03:28:16] <%$TJbeauregard> good bones are hard to find barbShrug
[2022-12-29 03:28:16] <bogenbroom> Max Skeletons would be a cool name
[2022-12-29 03:28:20] <%glitched_goddess> what does the oblivion card do
[2022-12-29 03:28:20] <%$Xel562> the form of the item determines what stats it will have for sure
[2022-12-29 03:28:20] <%$TWCblank> more villages!
[2022-12-29 03:28:22] <%Poney7442> batle field to have more chest
[2022-12-29 03:28:26] <%MMage09> i think the lich is straight fucked lol
[2022-12-29 03:28:27] <%Aknox23> How do you get the boss meter to full?
[2022-12-29 03:28:28] <%CS_Hague> The trick is that in this game, grey items with only 1 stat can actually be insane, in particular on the Rogue
[2022-12-29 03:28:28] <%$MrMelius> quality over quantity barbSmart
[2022-12-29 03:28:32] <SharpMox> @BarbarousKing I think the passive you chosecan summon a 4th skelly when you have max 3
[2022-12-29 03:28:35] <%+ZendoRin> Oh, no. More goblins.
[2022-12-29 03:28:35] <%msainy> fahmVibe
[2022-12-29 03:28:39] <hizzart04> Have you ever played Undermine? I think you’d be a big fan.. top-down roguelike but similar to rogue legacy where each death you are a relative of the last character you played as and you go deeper and deeper into the mine.
[2022-12-29 03:28:42] <%$azrael_dr> there's a new gobbo camp, might fuck you up
[2022-12-29 03:28:51] <SharpMox> Just like that
[2022-12-29 03:28:53] <%+WilyBomby> barb and chat, evening barbCheers
[2022-12-29 03:28:56] <%$Near____________> Undermine slaps for real
[2022-12-29 03:29:02] <%MMage09> the passive is a 20% chance to summon a skeleton beyond the max you currently have
[2022-12-29 03:29:02] <%HumourlessPig> Sooo, are we a good NecroMancer? or are we the Badies?
[2022-12-29 03:29:03] <KarraChr000> I think that the game lowers the drop rate of max skeleton bonuses after you get it to a certain point
[2022-12-29 03:29:04] <%+rhinorick123> no you can always summon more than 4 if you have a higher max
[2022-12-29 03:29:06] <%Poney7442> your village have upgraded
[2022-12-29 03:29:12] <%+Kressalak> the ability is when barb summons his last max skeleton (this time max is 3) he has a chance to summon 2 even if he does not have the slots for it
[2022-12-29 03:29:12] <maleblackfiora> you do not have any sklston quality? guess the squad makes it for that
[2022-12-29 03:29:14] <%Zere_Zavier> err you used to be able to summon skelly archers in the back row are you sure 3 is max
[2022-12-29 03:29:14] <%podrao> why you don't  drop the battlefields?
[2022-12-29 03:29:17] <@%$DanTheVP> I can only count to four
[2022-12-29 03:29:19] <%$unknownohyeah> yeah he got the upgraded village
[2022-12-29 03:29:25] <%$Xel562> I don't remember if the max is 4 or 6
[2022-12-29 03:29:32] <%$Near____________> @danthevp Impresssive
[2022-12-29 03:29:33] <$onvars> he had 5 skeletons one, the 5th was an archer on the left
[2022-12-29 03:29:34] <%rabidwombat311> yes
[2022-12-29 03:29:34] <%CS_Hague> Yes

[2022-12-29 03:29:37] <%$Lyconnn> chance to summon a better version of skelly
[2022-12-29 03:29:37] <majesticfail> 7 is max skeletons
[2022-12-29 03:29:38] <%+rhinorick123> summon quality = guard and warrior
[2022-12-29 03:29:38] <$delta_rayne> like the tanky ones
[2022-12-29 03:29:42] <Meszmer> quality is type of skellies level is how good they are
[2022-12-29 03:29:42] <%Whyeverso> I see your Psychostik reference Dan
[2022-12-29 03:29:43] <%rabidwombat311> but with your Level Perk, you probably don't care so much
[2022-12-29 03:29:44] <%HumourlessPig> Tears of the Kingdom?
[2022-12-29 03:29:45] <%+djeffers210> yes
[2022-12-29 03:29:46] <BobBiscuit> Quality makes it more likely for guards, warriors, and the like, to be summoned.
[2022-12-29 03:29:48] <Fatalhobo2> Basically a chance to "critically" summon
[2022-12-29 03:29:48] <%$gamefunatic_prime> have you ever played Jotun?
[2022-12-29 03:29:48] <+Irishgriffin515> yes
[2022-12-29 03:29:49] <iharris357> bingo
[2022-12-29 03:29:51] <nonamewizard> yeah you've got it

[2022-12-29 03:29:52] <%Zere_Zavier> summon quality is huge gives you tank and warrior and mage
[2022-12-29 03:29:53] <%homestar440> what comes after guard I wonder
[2022-12-29 03:29:54] <%HumourlessPig> Sooo, are we a good NecroMancer? or are we the Badies?

[2022-12-29 04:39:52] <%toxicpycnometer> @maleblackfiora  i went to work while it looped, thjere are a few infinite perks when you level up, and once you get enough of them you can practically loop infinitely

[2022-12-29 04:40:55] <%+poopenJaeger> why not place more stuff?
[2022-12-29 04:41:08] <%+bayetovsky> it starts simple and then it keeps on developing into more and more complex mechanics
[2022-12-29 04:41:09] <SquareMog> It kinda seems like being a DM for a D&D game
[2022-12-29 04:41:14] <%+Smartoss> lost oblivion KEKW
[2022-12-29 04:41:16] <%+AnimusAja> It helps that you only get a couple of terrain cards at a time too. So you can explore what they do and how they interact on your own terms
[2022-12-29 04:41:22] <%OOOO_Sebby> the game encourages experimentation and even if you have to start a new run it's not that bad
[2022-12-29 04:41:26] <%+Misssster_Anderson> are you burning cards now?
[2022-12-29 04:41:31] <%toxicpycnometer> @maleblackfiora i had every walking spot set as grove, because the flesh golems are pretty simple as necro
[2022-12-29 04:41:36] <%gotKrypto> each tile you place is one step closer to spawning a boss
[2022-12-29 04:41:38] <tmi_guy> the end game had my number and i let it go but my time with it was fun

[2022-12-29 14:12:01] <Varsidian> im both excited and a little bummed that they just went straight to hades 2, instead of doing something more with hades 1
[2022-12-29 14:12:10] <+frostynezz> Imagine if Hades had as much content as Binding of Isaac or Gungeon.
[2022-12-29 14:12:27] <Varsidian> but gotta give them credit at least for going with their sense of: "this game is complete and thats what you get."
[2022-12-29 14:12:31] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> Hades is quality over quantity
[2022-12-29 14:12:37] <miyabel> @Varsidian I think part of the reason for that is that its a design philosophy of supergiant games that their games dont need DLC.
[2022-12-29 14:12:44] <%thugalahad> i like how path of exile isnt even mentioned its just lame

[2022-12-29 14:28:01] <%Jake0502> @JeromeMorrow Funding would make a huge difference. More quality teachers, teachers now having to buy supplies, teachers not being guilted into not taking days off because of lack of sub teachers...
[2022-12-29 14:28:02] <%FrsMns> It's a HUGE gamble
[2022-12-29 14:28:09] <%+williard18> The hammer swap can seriously fuck you. especially on sword with cursed slash
[2022-12-29 14:28:14] <%$TTULangGenius> @JeromeMorrow On point about the "Let's throw more money at the problem."
[2022-12-29 14:28:24] <%FrsMns> Could be good. Or it could fuck you up even more
[2022-12-29 14:28:35] <%+MPainTrain> how much of teachers own money goes back into classrooms. my sister is an art teacher and had to start an Amazon wish list to get supplies from friends and families
[2022-12-29 14:28:43] <%+williard18> It's the ultimate last resort imo
[2022-12-29 14:28:44] <%WiLDRAGE777> good morning Barb, hope your day goes well
[2022-12-29 14:28:54] <%+cyeager332> Something about the definition of success teachers seems fucked too, though. A lot of it is just satisfying bullshit metrics.

[2022-12-29 15:04:23] <%nacho_ham_ravage_cabbage> lsrActually a cup of joe came from the Joe Vuetiful game, where he chugged coffee through his nipples

[2022-12-29 15:04:42] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> Cup of Joe started in WW2 because of cost cutting measures where they had to reduce actual ingredients for filler ingredients. One of the filler ingredients was Joemidium which the troops could taste over the actual coffee which led to them calling it a cup of joe

[2022-12-29 18:30:15] <%MattyTone> Terminator 2 definitely should have just ended the Franchise but it was so good they have been milking it since.

[2022-12-29 18:31:39] <mayocouture> Tarantino is the best at that

[2022-12-29 18:31:55] <%+0wlPacino> @barbarousking reminds me of your comment awhile ago where watching movies from a little while ago gives you whiplash compared to the Marvel shit today
[2022-12-29 18:31:55] <%Alraedris> Sometimes dialogue is lacklustre in terms of communicating what's happening (emotive stuffs is the heart of film) BUT it should absolutely be used.

[2022-12-29 18:32:14] <%$chloe_moonglow> @Hildibrah So a lot of people hate Chris Pratt cause he's part of a church that is very anti-LGBTQ. His acting is also just pretty bland overall, he's not great but he's not terrible

[2022-12-29 18:32:27] <%$taylorprince1982> that take was probably taken more-so nowadays... because find me a good movie with decent or relatable dialogue now
[2022-12-29 18:32:29] <%$Uzzah> A reminder that the lawyer in the OG JP was actually a good guy. He didn't want to open the park. barbSmart
[2022-12-29 18:32:30] <%BrassRabbit> One of the best scenes in the book as well.  You get so back story on the plant life that is poisonous you get a bit of that in the movie as well
[2022-12-29 18:32:31] <%Seda_Give> All comes back to movie writers being terrible

[2022-12-29 19:03:48] <%BelAirJeff> I’d start at OoT

[2022-12-29 19:03:49] <Kookee2k2> Be like me: START AT ZELDA II (like a baws)
[2022-12-29 19:03:49] <%anvaz> ALTTP or Link's Awakening are great places to start

[2022-12-29 20:07:51] <%kwsx> It has great world building and character writing. It's a bit silly sometimes but it gets more mature as the show continues.

[2022-12-29 20:08:40] <%TRMerik> Yeah it's heavy subjects but it's geared towards approaching those subjects from a child's mind... That doesn't change the angle. Infantile
[2022-12-29 20:08:40] <%Cocyx_The_Skeleton> but theres a bullet bill some times

[2022-12-29 20:27:02] <%+awesome_sauce222> the angel bost music is my favorite

[2022-12-29 20:27:09] <%Miets> i love when the boss crystal spawns and the music changes
[2022-12-29 20:27:11] <+Algork_> I replayed bastion after watching you start it on the 24, still one of my favs if a bit dated
[2022-12-29 20:27:11] <supanippon> I'm waiting for Barb's total war itch to come back
[2022-12-29 20:27:13] <%y2zipper> I just got to chapter 2.

[2022-12-29 20:27:20] <%RaysFTW> I wasn't really paying attention when you played Loop Hero during the 24hr stream so I have no idea what's going on now.
[2022-12-29 20:27:20] <ratkes> damn didn't think loop hero would click with you
[2022-12-29 20:27:24] <%+casteia> FLT or Loop Hero music chat - which one is better?
[2022-12-29 20:27:25] <%+AtlasKazam> It was impressive as fuck
[2022-12-29 20:27:26] <%fumblemumble> Loop Hero was free on Epic a while back. Might have to start playing it
[2022-12-29 20:27:26] <%Kingsgrave_> watching you play loop hero has been really dope, glad you love the game @BarbarousKing

[2022-12-29 20:27:31] <%anvaz> loop hero has such an elegant design. you just made me start a new run lately

[2022-12-29 20:27:31] <%+AdamSabre> I watched you play Loop Hero and still don't understand what it is.
[2022-12-29 20:27:33] <%Mebbeso> Did you lose interest in into the breach?
[2022-12-29 20:27:34] <%rubyweapon187> I bought loop hero yesterday because of you. I got to the first boss and then got dumpstered
[2022-12-29 20:27:36] <%Antog_____> I still don't know how you pulled off that luicfer build
[2022-12-29 20:27:38] <%$Bloody_Raw> @RaysFTW same
[2022-12-29 20:27:38] <%+AnimusAja> I really hope the devs can get out of Russia or something, and work on the expansion, or updates, or whatever they were doing before all of the nonsense over there.

[2022-12-29 20:29:04] <%+HardstuckTaco> just got nuggies for lunch, my day is made.
[2022-12-29 20:29:05] <%rawsp33d> @bombquistador Not every game should be a roguelike
[2022-12-29 20:29:09] <%RaysFTW> Having a goal or some kind of end to a story is a good incentive
[2022-12-29 20:29:10] <%Topgun486> I think it scratches that advanced wars itch but then didn't with no campaign
[2022-12-29 20:29:24] <Chillysteak> You got this Barb! Almost there
[2022-12-29 20:29:28] <BobBiscuit> Even a roguelike, done well, can have a campaign.

[2022-12-29 20:38:46] <%rawsp33d> @calamitymcgee It requires like 3 frame perfect inputs
[2022-12-29 20:38:49] <b_o_b66> the inputs are: flick the d pad at the top of your jump, and release the shell within 8 to 12 frames after that flick. make sure to not release y for more than 4 frames @BarbarousKing
[2022-12-29 20:38:49] <%+toughToes> There is a romhack specifically for practicing these. This must be hard

[2022-12-29 20:42:19] <%$MDBattleFrog> @drabillord you face left, then while turning right and the shell is still kinda in your body but technically to the right it allows mario to hit it midair hence the name

[2022-12-29 20:42:22] <%thejumpingmouse> @Drabillord You turn left and throw the shell, when you turn back right the shell will be thrown right but from the left side of mario, giving you time to jump on it since it will be under mario instead of in front

[2022-12-29 20:52:31] <%+versing_online> If you know how to do it and have practiced them they're not all that hard but it's really tough to just pull one out of nowhere
[2022-12-29 20:52:33] <%RaysFTW> Do you release at the apex or your jump or slightly before?
[2022-12-29 20:52:33] <%WilliVannilli> i believe in Barb
[2022-12-29 20:52:37] <Gruntiatus> I did this trick once in learn 2 kaizo and never looked back
[2022-12-29 20:52:40] <drocmofo> is this meant to be complete bullshit?
[2022-12-29 20:52:41] <$grandma_gray_> Hanson the band has some hot chick's in it
[2022-12-29 20:52:54] <%JustKitt> @gruntiatus same, only once
[2022-12-29 20:52:54] <%$FengWeiWay> @RaysFTW slight before
[2022-12-29 20:52:55] <%uropsalis> PauseChamp
[2022-12-29 20:52:57] <%+MaffYuu> @RaysFTW i feel like slighly before apex.
[2022-12-29 20:52:58] <%Cocyx_The_Skeleton> the music seems to imply they want the player to go insane
[2022-12-29 20:52:58] <%woodsterin97> Yes barbChat
[2022-12-29 20:52:58] <%gotKrypto> TIL i learned what a midair is barbShrug
[2022-12-29 20:52:59] <boozie703> Apparently it’s at like 11 o’clock from what I saw once
[2022-12-29 20:53:00] <%erojas1297> @versing_online i really hate them, but I am biased since i hate shell jumps in general
[2022-12-29 20:53:03] <b_o_b66> tried first turning left later so you don't lose too much speed
[2022-12-29 20:53:04] <%$strangecoinsz> @Prescience6631 i was thinking of that ngl. it s a cool hack but many stuff you probab wont encounter many often and until you hit specific hacks, and some stuff is just not fun to play it in such a hack, but i d rather practice in a creative hack with actual levels
[2022-12-29 20:53:06] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> barbSip
[2022-12-29 20:53:08] <$sussyscotty> @RaysFTW From what I understand at the apex, not before.
[2022-12-29 20:53:09] <%+tboUnderdog> That's because it isn't fun
[2022-12-29 20:53:10] <%rabidwombat311> give chat the controller, they can all do it, apparently
