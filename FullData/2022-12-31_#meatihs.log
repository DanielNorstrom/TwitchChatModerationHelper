[2022-12-31 00:00:22] <ALEX_KOU> love it
[2022-12-31 00:00:29] <fly1ngcat> average priest gameplay
[2022-12-31 00:00:32] <ALEX_KOU> feels so unique every time

[2022-12-31 00:01:34] <fly1ngcat> but i agree
[2022-12-31 00:01:42] <fly1ngcat> attrition priest is horrific
[2022-12-31 00:01:58] <fly1ngcat> people want dh rogue to be nerfed only to see more blood dks

[2022-12-31 00:02:21] <+reaperonetho> if they nerf dh and rogue dk frost is gonna be tier 1
[2022-12-31 00:02:35] <fly1ngcat> frost is good into rogue
[2022-12-31 00:02:37] <fly1ngcat> so maybe not
[2022-12-31 00:02:44] <+MUPIA> AoO priest was amazing, but after that they went back to steal or mana cheat priest again and ruined it @fly1ngcat
[2022-12-31 00:02:45] <+reaperonetho> yep that's true
[2022-12-31 00:03:07] <fly1ngcat> @mupia you mean illucia priest?
[2022-12-31 00:03:08] <blaze35hs> but how u nerf dh its gonna be prob escaping it

[2022-12-31 00:04:16] <+MUPIA> @fly1ngcat no, i mean galakrond control priest where you generated your own value with control priest, and didnt rely shit like identity theft. i loathe steal mechanics in every damn game
[2022-12-31 00:04:21] <+reaperonetho> @blaze35hs  i dont have a bad wr vs dh with frost
[2022-12-31 00:04:36] <AvasiiaHS> hand dh

[2022-12-31 00:16:24] <!%+shanevapid> Barrens priest was literally the only playable deck. You’ve misremembered
[2022-12-31 00:16:24] <DysenteryGary7> it's always otk dh meta
[2022-12-31 00:16:42] <fico0> the most toxic deck ever to be played in hs
[2022-12-31 00:16:43] <fly1ngcat> meati you might be the unpopular one on liking barrens priest
[2022-12-31 00:16:43] <@%pocket_train> from a competitive point it was the nuts because the better player almost always won the priest mirror

[2022-12-31 00:17:39] <meteospasmyl> @meatihs Reddit disagree
[2022-12-31 00:17:39] <saltyychan> like 4 games? :)
[2022-12-31 00:17:42] <jazielfl> that was what, 4 games?
[2022-12-31 00:17:43] <fly1ngcat> i thought it was who timed illucia down and got the most value out of opponents hand
[2022-12-31 00:17:43] <+szukuro> 4 hours control priest? that's like 5 games

[2022-12-31 00:17:56] <owain1607> isnt that because everyone you're playing is drunk between 12 and 4 am

[2022-12-31 02:05:39] <avatazula> i feel like it is unlikely they would change shadowstep cos they don't wanna change the essence to rogue or something

[2022-12-31 02:05:43] <cizuss> gnoll should have just read "costs 1 less for each non rogue class card you added to your hand", and maybe have his stats buffed

[2022-12-31 02:09:48] <thankmr_skeltal> so gnolls are in a weird spot
[2022-12-31 02:09:55] <!%+shanevapid> The best meta was when joust came out and the geniuses figured out you could make a deck with a bunch of joust cards and just skip your opponent’s turn bc the animation was so long

[2022-12-31 02:15:35] <cizuss> they should just nerf dh's 1 mana runed mithril rod imo
[2022-12-31 02:15:45] <cizuss> that also starts in their hand
[2022-12-31 02:15:46] <lavantcg> just dont let cards be reduced below 1
[2022-12-31 02:15:50] <lavantcg> thats all they need to do
[2022-12-31 02:16:08] <blaze35hs> minimum mana cost of card now is 1 ok
[2022-12-31 02:16:38] <fly1ngcat> if they do nerf shadow step it is not because its broken
[2022-12-31 02:16:47] <@%$Raptorheart> is that a new card

[2022-12-31 02:18:43] <cizuss> shadowstep scales with the power level of battlecries, which is why it's been so powerful throughout the whole time, because battlecries kept getting stronger
[2022-12-31 02:18:45] <vividwonder> loads XD
[2022-12-31 02:18:53] <fly1ngcat> theres 2 monkaS
[2022-12-31 02:19:03] <lavantcg> remove stealth
[2022-12-31 02:19:07] <cizuss> just remove the stealth from the location

[2022-12-31 02:19:11] <%Devilseye44> I still find the game way more interesting when rogue is the top class .... i really can't stand a ramp druid meta again .... it just too boring
[2022-12-31 02:19:24] <+wetriedboyz> way more problems then shadowstep
[2022-12-31 02:19:26] <+reaperonetho> the coin dude
[2022-12-31 02:19:29] <melidolas> remove stealth
[2022-12-31 02:19:30] <vividwonder> shadowstep was unplayaple before nathria
[2022-12-31 02:19:47] <+iTvngo> Good targets and it just synergizes so well with location. Value upon value
[2022-12-31 02:19:49] <+wetriedboyz> your just moaning and moaning when its been in the game since release KekW
[2022-12-31 02:19:49] <cizuss> idk if people here know, but og edwin used to be 1/1 with stealth instead of 2/2, and it was nerfed because stealth + growing stats was absurd
[2022-12-31 02:20:01] <blaze35hs> norwis on coin L
[2022-12-31 02:20:19] <@Sipiwi94> @MeatiHS Shadowstep legit was op since classic hearthstone and completely created archetypes
[2022-12-31 02:20:23] <@Sipiwi94> since miracle rogue
[2022-12-31 02:20:42] <matmarex> sorc did not deserve to die Sadge
[2022-12-31 02:20:47] <!%PervyOldGuy> bring back sorc i agree
[2022-12-31 02:20:51] <thankmr_skeltal> they murdered sorc apprentice because spamming 0 mana spells is unfun for the opponent
[2022-12-31 02:20:59] <dendaihs> prenerf it would be so good still
[2022-12-31 02:21:01] <thankmr_skeltal> thankfully that doenst happen in standard

[2022-12-31 02:21:27] <cizuss> @Franz469 no it wouldnt
[2022-12-31 02:21:27] <mamoneStv> @Sipiwi94 leeroy 4 mana xd
[2022-12-31 02:21:39] <ASparrow_> radiant elemental still running around making priest a class
[2022-12-31 02:21:45] <@%$Raptorheart> @thankmr_skeltal You can play Mozaki again in wild with the new apprentice, i was doing it for the achievements
[2022-12-31 02:21:47] <Inn0x> Would be too slow
[2022-12-31 02:21:50] <cizuss> i'm pretty sure it's unplayable without the discount, with 1 mana discount maybe
[2022-12-31 02:21:52] <fly1ngcat> shadowstep has never been powerful, it is like swindle, it makes a good toolkit
[2022-12-31 02:21:53] <@Sipiwi94> ofc it would not be broken if it didnt discount. But it would also be a shit card
[2022-12-31 02:21:56] <+reaperonetho> because the card is fun
[2022-12-31 02:21:58] <%TimmY_PranksteR> its fking free
[2022-12-31 02:22:03] <lavantcg> its basically rogues whole class
[2022-12-31 02:22:06] <dendaihs> i think it would in jackpot rouge
[2022-12-31 02:22:13] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> rogue gets unplayably boring without it
[2022-12-31 02:22:21] <JonnyFairplay2000> Leeroy + cold blood x2 + shadowstep x2 was a stupid combo back in the day.
[2022-12-31 02:22:32] <lavantcg> quest rogur as well lmao
[2022-12-31 02:22:35] <@Sipiwi94> remember keleseth rogue?
[2022-12-31 02:22:36] <fly1ngcat> we can pull up hsreplay and check the decks
[2022-12-31 02:22:41] <@Sipiwi94> Oh shadowstep made it broken
[2022-12-31 02:22:47] <@Sipiwi94> what a surprise
[2022-12-31 02:22:47] <fly1ngcat> no where will you see shadowstep as the oppressive deck
[2022-12-31 02:22:47] <+reaperonetho> oh god quest rogue was so f un
[2022-12-31 02:22:50] <fly1ngcat> card
[2022-12-31 02:22:51] <vividwonder> revert cold blood and prep and take away step im ok

[2022-12-31 02:22:52] <thankmr_skeltal> i mean i think some of it comes down to fatigue. even if its not statistically broken rotating cards that have been played for years makes the game more fun
[2022-12-31 02:22:54] <cizuss> without shadowstep, prepare to be playing boring pirate rogue with shitty minions that go face
[2022-12-31 02:22:55] <ejvald> how about shadowstep as it is, but can't reduce to 0?
[2022-12-31 02:23:01] <+wetriedboyz> @Lvl_100_Magikarp rogue would still be playable without step 1000%

[2022-12-31 02:23:32] <!%+shanevapid> They should just make shadowstep the rogue hero power

[2022-12-31 02:23:36] <lavantcg> @fly1ngcat if thats true why didnt every deck just ply kelseth?

[2022-12-31 02:23:42] <Aptesun> hm nessie disagrees with no warrior
[2022-12-31 02:23:44] <%timocrx> we had warrior until may
[2022-12-31 02:23:46] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> team 5 is just rogue mains KEKW
[2022-12-31 02:23:50] <%ChrisIsError_> calm down fenoStein
[2022-12-31 02:23:51] <cizuss> that's a norwis classic
[2022-12-31 02:23:55] <askad37> and you could say that step was pretty much unplayable in SEVERAL metas so i dont get the nitpicking
[2022-12-31 02:23:56] <CJBeck> tell you what’s mental right, they nerfed two rogue decks at once and is still has two tier one decks
[2022-12-31 02:23:57] <+reaperonetho> but instead of demolish the most fun class in the game they could print good cards for other classes
[2022-12-31 02:23:58] <CJBeck> unreal
[2022-12-31 02:23:59] <@Sipiwi94> meati playing against sorc apprentice LOL
[2022-12-31 02:24:04] <fly1ngcat> @lavantcg thats like saying why does every warrior play shield block
[2022-12-31 02:24:04] <@Sipiwi94> just as he talked about it
[2022-12-31 02:24:05] <vividwonder> rogue was unplayable until nathria, no?

[2022-12-31 02:24:12] <norkburger> If rogue cards were as bad as warrior’s, would you still want a shadow step nerf?
[2022-12-31 02:24:21] <lavantcg> @fly1ngcat no its not at all lmao
[2022-12-31 02:24:23] <CJBeck> also how can you have sorc at 4 but radiant at 2
[2022-12-31 02:24:27] <CJBeck> makes 0 sense
[2022-12-31 02:24:27] <lavantcg> ones a neutral card
[2022-12-31 02:24:33] <blaze35hs> only player not dying to the 2nd dagger swing sadge
[2022-12-31 02:24:37] <+wetriedboyz> make step legendary and but make it infuse or manaburn (4) or something
[2022-12-31 02:24:37] <@Sipiwi94> ehy cant that taunt be silenced honestly
[2022-12-31 02:24:39] <lavantcg> what does shield block have to do with kel
[2022-12-31 02:24:42] <cizuss> @CJBeck because one is wild and the other is standard?
[2022-12-31 02:24:47] <cizuss> and in different classes?
[2022-12-31 02:24:48] <+solazahs> why is norwis the only person playing boon priest even after he showed the nerfs did nothing?
[2022-12-31 02:24:49] <fly1ngcat> @lavantcg because it is a generic support card and fyi weapon rogue or any aggressive rogue didnt play step
[2022-12-31 02:24:52] <cizuss> priest has zero burn
[2022-12-31 02:24:58] <cizuss> that's a dumb comparison

[2022-12-31 02:27:46] <CJBeck> lovely!
[2022-12-31 02:27:49] <Hygs_HS> i find it more fair to make it only cost 1 less whenyou get it back in hand, and not make the spell itself cost 1 @MeatiHS
[2022-12-31 02:27:55] <+solazahs> i liked the idea of shadowstep reduced 2 but never costs less than 1 @MeatiHS
[2022-12-31 02:28:01] <soundwavecanada> @MeatiHS do you ever think about science experiments for your field irl. Like as an almost Geologist I try each summer to figure out transmutation in my backyard

[2022-12-31 02:28:08] <D0nDi4blo> reduce its cost by two but not less then 1 would be sufficient as a nerf for most cases no?

[2022-12-31 02:28:11] <Franz469> i mean rogue has too many very good 0 mana cards
[2022-12-31 02:28:30] <fly1ngcat> @lavantcg if you want stats you can analyze drawn winrate of step but we know you base your opinion on emotions

[2022-12-31 02:28:41] <+sathiru_> @reaperonetho i see ty (didnt know quest was a spell)
[2022-12-31 02:28:53] <blaze35hs> prep should discount 5 for sprint no?

[2022-12-31 02:29:37] <Hygs_HS> @fly1ngcat played winrate would be more idicative of its power than drawn winrate
[2022-12-31 02:30:07] <blaze35hs> step the mailmann for a coin here and there
[2022-12-31 02:30:09] <fly1ngcat> @hygs_hs played wr is irrelevant, for example mecathun play wr would be like 80%
[2022-12-31 02:30:10] <bizjeet5> drawn winrate has tons of bias
[2022-12-31 02:30:12] <Inn0x> How about step costs 1 and discounts 3 😀
[2022-12-31 02:30:22] <MarkFromTheePark> he could still be blood tho

[2022-12-31 02:31:41] <avatazula> i'm looking at the drawn wr for shadowstep and it's the 4th lowest. The highest are astalor, gnoll, carb, belt
[2022-12-31 02:31:48] <avatazula> this is for miracle rogue
[2022-12-31 02:31:52] <+reaperonetho> i shaved my balls today
[2022-12-31 02:31:56] <bizjeet5> for example finley's played wr always being terrible (because you often play it in bad spots)

[2022-12-31 02:32:12] <bizjeet5> doesn't mean finley is bad or should be cut

[2022-12-31 02:34:31] <%ebxcap> tournament is so different though
[2022-12-31 02:34:38] <프랜 (amourfou)> I can relate

[2022-12-31 02:34:42] <fly1ngcat> well tournaments is not ladder tho
[2022-12-31 02:34:50] <!%PervyOldGuy> that is a terrible example
[2022-12-31 02:34:57] <fly1ngcat> you ban and u target decks in tourneys

[2022-12-31 02:35:20] <+hokagedohs> stats are good so u can have some notion of how some games go without having to play it out
[2022-12-31 02:35:22] <Drudrutt> People are going to look at the stats and pick decks that beat those tho
[2022-12-31 02:35:22] <bizjeet5> why don't u ever play miracle rogue meati?
[2022-12-31 02:35:23] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> true
[2022-12-31 02:35:26] <Eriadar> you cant look at stats in tournament tho right? you have to know what you are banning and what are you trying to beat, not look at the best decks overall no?
[2022-12-31 02:35:26] <%ebxcap> so you want to nerf cards for top 100
[2022-12-31 02:35:28] <Atpeta> or plan something
[2022-12-31 02:35:38] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> there just isn’t enough sample size at the very top
[2022-12-31 02:35:38] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> like minelock has different stats in top 100 and top 1000
[2022-12-31 02:35:40] <+reaperonetho> so they shouldn't nerf shadow step because stats are wrong?
[2022-12-31 02:35:44] <+chuuwire> Knowing you're right chatting
[2022-12-31 02:35:58] <JonnyFairplay2000> Just remember patron warrior, stats said it was one of the shittiest decks, but the top level players piloting abused the shit out of it.
[2022-12-31 02:36:11] <+Sn4keEater> people happy with the meta cause now they can finally beat the meat
[2022-12-31 02:36:15] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> the stats are often contamianted by wrong doing of people right?
[2022-12-31 02:36:24] <blaze35hs> yeah draka was best card nog rogue unplayable so stats are nothing
[2022-12-31 02:36:29] <MarkFromTheePark> Boon priest right now.
[2022-12-31 02:36:30] <+reaperonetho> @JonnyFairplay2000 ye that deck was hard to play, i was part of the shit stats
[2022-12-31 02:36:32] <+hokagedohs> the issue with killing step it is that it is a very unique card and that has shapped rogue throughout all these years
[2022-12-31 02:36:48] <MarkFromTheePark> boon priest statistically 40% wr deck, norwis is getting 80% wr and legend on 3 servers
[2022-12-31 02:36:56] <JonnyFairplay2000> @reaperonetho I tried it a few times and then noped the fuck out of it, even as a legend player at the time
[2022-12-31 02:37:08] <ur_too_slowbro> If you make Shadowstep 1 mana it won’t kill the class, it will slow it down making pop off turns manageable, Wild thou it would hurt the class mainly combo decks (example Location and Draka) Wild Miracle is just too slow when compared to other options at higher ranks
[2022-12-31 02:37:09] <MarkFromTheePark> legend 1*
[2022-12-31 02:37:11] <Rep3ntance> The stats websites have beast hunter as a top 3 deck…

[2022-12-31 02:37:17] <%GameOn__> stats lie D:
[2022-12-31 02:37:21] <%serj_hs> shirvallah pala was kinda the same, 40% deck and there were people getting it into MT finals
[2022-12-31 02:37:22] <kingganondorf1> j4ckieGiggle j4ckieGiggle
[2022-12-31 02:37:36] <bizjeet5> @markfromtheepark this is also because norwis only plays good matchups in rogue and dh at top legend
[2022-12-31 02:37:39] <Eriadar> stats dont lie, ppl just dont realise what they mean @MeatiHS
[2022-12-31 02:37:39] <seqvar> meati why dont play quest spell dh
[2022-12-31 02:37:42] <fly1ngcat> boar priest had above 50 wr in top legend tho
[2022-12-31 02:37:53] <blaze35hs> my quest preist never under 65 percent wr
[2022-12-31 02:37:56] <D0nDi4blo> shivala pala i felt was rather easy to play no?
[2022-12-31 02:37:57] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> not in every legend
[2022-12-31 02:38:07] <Eriadar> 50%
[2022-12-31 02:38:08] <bizjeet5> if you are playing boon at d10 you are running into blood dks and other actual unplayable matchups
[2022-12-31 02:38:10] <owain1607> i play a lot of rogue. shadowstep is one of the most fun cards im the class. it is exceptionally poweful. the class would be hit really hard if it was nerfed.
[2022-12-31 02:38:12] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> boar priest was only specifically above 50 wr in high legend
[2022-12-31 02:38:20] <blaze35hs> but i dont q it now xdd
[2022-12-31 02:38:21] <%ebxcap> garrot rogue
[2022-12-31 02:38:22] <+sathiru_> according to the stats we should all be playing token druid
[2022-12-31 02:38:30] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> but still proplayer bring boar priest to the tourney
[2022-12-31 02:38:37] <+chuuwire> very high skill ceiling decks will generally always be better at high ranks
[2022-12-31 02:38:45] <+hokagedohs> @sathiru_ or enrage warrior
[2022-12-31 02:38:47] <+iTvngo> Stats can be very deceptive. More accidents happen by sober people than drunk people... does that mean drunk driving is safer? Obiously not. Same with win rates of some decks. Just because bad players are tanking a skill intensive deck, doesn't mean the deck is bad
[2022-12-31 02:38:54] <D0nDi4blo> yeah i mean data aquired over the totality ofa ll players dont say sh*t ofc
[2022-12-31 02:39:01] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> yeah
[2022-12-31 02:39:11] <Eriadar> @sathiru_ you cant look at the free hsreplay stats mate :D
[2022-12-31 02:39:14] <avatazula> do you think high skill ceiling decks should be rewarded with better winrate at higher decks like the aformentioned boar apm priest
[2022-12-31 02:39:16] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> it happens to other games to
[2022-12-31 02:39:18] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> too

[2022-12-31 02:39:32] <+the_high_groundd> i think this might be one of the higher skill metas in standard
[2022-12-31 02:39:34] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> like in AOS champions get nerf for pro play
[2022-12-31 02:39:39] <fly1ngcat> yeh boar priest across all ranks was in the 40% but in high legend only it was above 50%
[2022-12-31 02:39:42] <마법소녀김수미 (oneside)> even when their winrate is above 45%

[2022-12-31 02:42:34] <bizjeet5> @semenretentionchad because he plays nothing but dh and miracle rogue, boon's 2 best matchup. boon priest was built as a hard counter to miracle roguw

[2022-12-31 02:42:35] <Arismendi> @MeatiHS whats ur winrate vs dh

[2022-12-31 02:42:57] <+hokagedohs> hs is not as easy to play as meati is pointing out

[2022-12-31 02:43:01] <+hokagedohs> so isnt dh
[2022-12-31 02:43:10] <+hokagedohs> the deck is still broken nonetheless
[2022-12-31 02:43:19] <skoozeey> Can you make discard DH work in standard?

[2022-12-31 02:43:48] <skoozeey> Discard warlock
[2022-12-31 02:44:09] <+hokagedohs> they always will want to make the game somehow as appealing to whoever is playing
[2022-12-31 02:44:11] <+hokagedohs> as they can
[2022-12-31 02:44:17] <+hokagedohs> aint easy task though

[2022-12-31 02:45:27] <matmarex> @Ganbare_Gaijin it's not really meaningful, since if a deck is too good, everyone plays it and it drops to 50% win rate
[2022-12-31 02:45:32] <Eriadar> yep, the game is trying to piss you of even more
[2022-12-31 02:45:44] <bizjeet5> game is fine right now, just play miracle rogue. deck is fun and skillful. playing this low iq dh cheese will have anyone depressed

[2022-12-31 03:50:38] <slyweard> no chance he wasn't sick in 35 years. so that means he went to work while being sick. that is not responsible towards his coworkers and working while sick promotes the whole "just come to work sick" employer agenda

[2022-12-31 06:04:30] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> americans are dumb enough to think they pay less with insurance than they would in tax. studies prove that the cost of medical in US is 20% more just because of insurers overhead

[2022-12-31 18:34:01] <alexmirash> animation time is kind of additional parameter similar to cast time.  So it's a part of mechanics
[2022-12-31 18:34:06] <ProgettazioneInferni> have you ever played other games on stream ?
[2022-12-31 18:34:07] <+Gianfrasca> that deck can't be played anymore with new cards, too many spell
[2022-12-31 18:34:24] <dalitzking> i would like lower time per turn but have say 1 turn where you could double your turn timer once per game

[2022-12-31 20:16:39] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @shanevapid he didn't "get cancelled", he did a stupid thing and lots of people didn't like that, but he could have still continued to stream. He decided for himself to not stream to avoid getting reactions to his behavior

[2022-12-31 20:18:16] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> to be "cancelled", some instance has to shut you out of their service, like a TV station stopping to show you or Twitch banning you. That didn't happen. He could have continued to stream
[2022-12-31 20:18:41] <wilhelms_cream> he cancelled himself

[2022-12-31 21:14:24] <+SuddenHuevos> this meta is complete ass
[2022-12-31 21:14:36] <nerdslivesmatter> every meta is the worst meta

[2022-12-31 21:14:45] <%Vengeance_88> @JokerFrags No patch till next year haHAA
[2022-12-31 21:14:48] <pepefrogqt> this meta is awful, rogue and dh are too dominating
[2022-12-31 21:14:57] <Demobalderes> This is the actual worst meta though
[2022-12-31 21:15:08] <ambdoexious> alot of ppl hated renathal
[2022-12-31 21:15:10] <JokerFrags> people complained about beast hunter
[2022-12-31 21:15:12] <JokerFrags> KEK
[2022-12-31 21:15:17] <LobotomizzamiTutto> Is the worst meta we ever had until the next one YEP
[2022-12-31 21:15:18] <!%+shanevapid> Every meta is the worst meta to someone, though
[2022-12-31 21:15:19] <chrisvel89> Worst meta was weapon Rogue
[2022-12-31 21:15:28] <%Vengeance_88> Lowkey sire meta was better than this at least had more variety
[2022-12-31 21:15:30] <+Simylol> Weapon rogue was lit

[2022-12-31 21:15:49] <AoD7> @MeatiHS Denathrius nerf was enough i dont know why they nerfed renathal as well
[2022-12-31 21:15:54] <LobotomizzamiTutto> Stormwind, weapon rogue, this … Can’t choose
[2022-12-31 21:15:57] <+Simylol> We just need a rotation and power level will go down dramatically
[2022-12-31 21:15:57] <AoD7> after dena nerf game was fine
[2022-12-31 21:16:01] <magic_pants666> worst mete was questline meta
[2022-12-31 21:16:03] <gert1984> I dont like the meta either, the decks are fun tho but its not fun to lose on turn 5 or 6 in 50% of the gammes
[2022-12-31 21:16:25] <juniorfd> Sadge patch only next year
[2022-12-31 21:16:40] <MarkFromTheePark> I loved quest warlock

[2022-12-31 21:17:13] <+chumsta> My favorite deck was celestial druid
[2022-12-31 21:17:18] <kazasatanpls> Worst meta was the Grand Tournament meta. 1 hour long games.
[2022-12-31 21:17:19] <+Simylol> Only thing I get from this discussion is that everyone finds different metas to be the worst
[2022-12-31 21:17:19] <+zotlann> D6, the player with the better mulligan wins turn 5 :), great meta :)
[2022-12-31 21:17:22] <MarkFromTheePark> Do you think they'll do a balance patch next week?
[2022-12-31 21:17:25] <magic_pants666> quest mage and warlock actual cancer

[2022-12-31 21:17:56] <@%tictac_hs> Gimme some control pala control mage control shaman action gachiGASM
[2022-12-31 21:18:02] <chrisvel89> Libram Pala was the worst meta in a while when it was tied with weapon rogue too
[2022-12-31 21:18:05] <!%+shanevapid> Everyone complaining about the game being over turn 6 and here I am just playing hs while taking a dump and trying not to get hemorrhoids. 6 turns is perfect
[2022-12-31 21:18:07] <+zotlann> no shot you're complaining about quest rogue lol
[2022-12-31 21:18:16] <chrisvel89> libram Pala lasted almost a year in the meta again
[2022-12-31 21:18:22] <@%Tinyfred> How was Libram the worst meta
[2022-12-31 21:18:23] <chrisvel89> it just kept coming back
[2022-12-31 21:18:36] <AoD7> libram was super toxic pre pen flinger nerf
[2022-12-31 21:18:37] <chrisvel89> There was too much heal and control
[2022-12-31 21:18:46] <%Vengeance_88> No way libram is one of the worst
[2022-12-31 21:18:46] <MarkFromTheePark> I don't mind control paladin, but I don't want to see Cariel ever played again
[2022-12-31 21:18:47] <+Kaldelt> remember that paladin deck that had a 25 cost card in it and you could fire a cards cost at the opponent to kill them? xD
[2022-12-31 21:18:48] <@%Tinyfred> I thought it was dope
[2022-12-31 21:18:48] <+zotlann> worst meta was barrens 25% concede against priest meta
[2022-12-31 21:18:50] <@%tictac_hs> Libram pala was super nice
[2022-12-31 21:18:54] <+dpashinsky> hey looser wasnt me
[2022-12-31 21:18:54] <mrsexter69> @meatihs freeze mage matchup was the most skillful matchup
[2022-12-31 21:18:56] <MyDen59> libram pala was fun when pen flinger got nerfed
[2022-12-31 21:19:03] <@%Tinyfred> Libram pally was like my favorite deck post pen nerf
[2022-12-31 21:19:05] <SoEmpty322> tbh I dont really remember a meta I hated because I always have a class I like, but some linear no brain decks like token druids are biggest offenders to me

[2022-12-31 21:19:29] <@%Tinyfred> One of my favorite metas was when mechs were T1, like all the Zilliax decks
[2022-12-31 21:19:31] <!%+shanevapid> Pre nerf pen flinger was great. Perfect amount of toxic for the game

[2022-12-31 21:20:02] <chrisvel89> Libram of Hope was one of the most annoying cards with Devout Pupil

[2022-12-31 21:20:26] <girthySenpai> id say so lol
[2022-12-31 21:20:28] <@%Tinyfred> @chrisvel89 The reason it wasn't toxic is because it was mainly a strong board based deck. It wasnt killing you from hand, you could easily build a deck to counter it.
[2022-12-31 21:20:32] <@%Tinyfred> Unlike some of the strong ones right now
