[2023-01-07 22:19:32] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side

[2023-01-07 23:40:30] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side
[2023-01-07 23:40:33] <+Xeffary> cap bastion's an s tier dps
