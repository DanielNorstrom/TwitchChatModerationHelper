[2023-01-11 09:13:04] <bushy> yeah Malenia is very impressive. I tried to do Malenia with only staff melees and gave up on that because of her healing.
[2023-01-11 09:13:18] <%Mr_Ink0gnit0> Btw, the fatty's roll still doesnt stop after he hits you once?

[2023-01-11 12:11:49] <%+TheLeviathong> @atonat_ Usually I don't like to cheese things or use the most OP strats, but they're an exception because they're so janky if you don't heal them

[2023-01-11 15:02:45] <French_Cyndaquil> @bluelabrador I'm not talking about the size of the AOE, I'm talking about the predictibility, whether or not it looks like you got hit when you do get hit. There are several attacks whose hitboxes do not line up with the visual effect in radagon's fight, it's counter-intuitive and I expected it to be fixed but it wasn't
