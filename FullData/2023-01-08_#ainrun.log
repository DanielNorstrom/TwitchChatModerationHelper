[2023-01-08 10:26:39] <vladdywu> when i fought maliketh
[2023-01-08 10:26:40] <@%ArhamSAA> you could use the rot dog to proc rot and then use cursed-blood pots to keep him away from maliketh OKAY

[2023-01-08 11:06:55] <%sad_goblin_96> 2 hours in and weve fought malekith once
[2023-01-08 11:06:56] <%zrattyL> latenna is so good i she soloed malenia when i was doing summons only
[2023-01-08 11:07:00] <+itsmeadowss> @TheGloriousRage oh nice. I was so keen to see that one because I remember watching Iron Pineapple (I think?) giving up on summons only because he couldn't beat Fire Giant. That's sick

[2023-01-08 11:07:29] <+dragonviper_> @ArhamSAA is the first time chatter thing something you only see as a streamer/mod or is it an FFZ add-on?

[2023-01-08 11:07:36] <%zrattyL> 1 summon perboss YesYes
[2023-01-08 11:07:42] <%TheGloriousRage> @itsmeadowss ya... it's a really tricky one. basically all the bosses from giant until the end are tricky
[2023-01-08 11:07:42] <+dragonviper_> ah OKAY
[2023-01-08 11:07:46] <%zrattyL> yes

[2023-01-08 11:08:09] <%sad_goblin_96> just kill the tree sentinel
[2023-01-08 11:08:10] <+dragonviper_> parrying mali does damage
[2023-01-08 11:08:13] <@%ArhamSAA> maliketh has 2200 sleep resistance or either he is immune
[2023-01-08 11:08:13] <+dragonviper_> not allowed
[2023-01-08 11:08:18] <goldy_the_unbreakable> the only important rule is to win
[2023-01-08 11:08:21] <%zrattyL> maliketh immune to sleep
[2023-01-08 11:08:22] <%+gleefulgm> use rogues gambit
[2023-01-08 11:08:22] <@%+ATONAT_> Tree sentinel doesn’t even aggro now you docked him

[2023-01-08 11:08:32] <%pink_noizz> alright
[2023-01-08 11:08:33] <+itsmeadowss> @TheGloriousRage yeah. but man it's pretty exciting seeing Ain knock them all off

[2023-01-08 13:25:49] <%osor_io> I just buy original Xbox or PS controllers and replace the parts when they wear out, ends up being much cheaper I think (and you don' thave to use trash :D )
[2023-01-08 13:25:51] <Persianwarior> I always go for the most plain looking things.
[2023-01-08 13:25:55] <%Bootie101> ooohhhhhh
[2023-01-08 13:26:12] <%its_Megga> a bit expensive theres a controller that uses hall effect joysticks which dont wear like the common potentiometer joystick controller
