[2022-12-11 14:25:01] <%Lorrdzik> yes
[2022-12-11 14:25:02] <%Collnaris> he's taken a long break before
[2022-12-11 14:25:03] <KawariDrood> I got a BA degree and went into a job afterwards.. then the recession hit and I lost my job. I ended up going back to uni to get a different degree that I could get a job in - I was 26 when I went back the second time. You can always go back later if you want :) (though I appreciate it can be more expensive!)
[2022-12-11 14:25:05] <MushiVG> Regular jobs have paid vacation, it's insane that you can't take breaks as a streamer

[2022-12-11 14:25:10] <%drzaius30> I think Asmons youtube presence really helps

[2022-12-11 14:32:12] <+Buckerts> being raised as a Christian, I feel like I've been robbed of a lot of the experiences people have in the mid to late teens, finding religion I believe is more powerful instead of being raised in it
[2022-12-11 14:32:13] <+Theguywhodoneit> some religions are like a cult where the leaders tell you who you can date, marry and what you can do for work.
[2022-12-11 14:32:14] <%+vileuno> You also come from Sweden, and every bit of your lived experience is based around a society with equal rights for men and women. So once someone tries to put limitations on you because you are a woman, then you would react right
[2022-12-11 14:32:15] <%+xarthrea> All religions create shame around breaking their weird rules
[2022-12-11 14:32:15] <%Banestrom> The human brain finishes development at age 26 to 27, so maybe don't make life altering decisions before then (obviously not applicable in all situations)
[2022-12-11 14:32:15] <%ConorH678> its the extreme measures with religion you mean

[2022-12-11 14:32:21] <+FullMetalOmar> @AnnieFuchsia  it's optional, people should only tell you, but not force you

[2022-12-11 14:32:23] <%$Mordotzz> Then tons of religous ppl including muslims who arent like that
[2022-12-11 14:32:24] <Jelerman> hi annie
[2022-12-11 14:32:25] <+TeacLP> Isnt that just tribalism masquerading as religion? And you have tribalism everywhere without religion
[2022-12-11 14:32:32] <%Geoffku> that would be kinda impossible to enforce though LUL
[2022-12-11 14:32:35] <%raiwist> @FullMetalOmar well it evidently is, but i cant be bothered to debate it because we've both made out minds up already
[2022-12-11 14:32:36] <+Kai_Khang> My mum started to despise religion because her parents would forced her to act or behave a certain way and they started burning all her clothes when she started dating @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-11 14:32:41] <+beans508> Religeon is fucking gross. And the people in iran are sick of it
[2022-12-11 14:32:42] <+Aronah1982> Thats indoctrination, mindcontrol
[2022-12-11 14:32:43] <richdsils> because that was what she was told by her parents
[2022-12-11 14:32:44] <KawariDrood> I think religion could be taught from a historical standpoint.. but not from a 'this is how you should life your life'.
[2022-12-11 14:32:45] <cidoywow> I grew up in a Christian household and my mom told me that I should follow only the 10 commandments  and if you read them they are not bad actually.
[2022-12-11 14:32:46] <@%skibbatv> @ForestWilde this. Always backhandedly and guised as "protection"

[2022-12-11 14:32:54] <+illydan2513> school can braiwash kids as well. responsability of adults towars children is what should matter and be discussed
[2022-12-11 14:32:59] <Lord_stuba> religion in it current form, mostly is brainwashing

[2022-12-11 14:33:00] <just_stefvn> Any religion has ideas on how you're supposed to life so all religion should be exposed to people that are mature. It is actually the same that is happening in school with political ideas indoctrinated to children.
[2022-12-11 14:33:01] <%+Erainne> Yeah thats how dogmatism works
[2022-12-11 14:33:01] <Syncletic> sadly its not only religions that brain wash kids medias and movie can have the same effect
[2022-12-11 14:33:01] <Necrolily> I think religion in 2022 is useless, nothing but bad comes out of em all.
[2022-12-11 14:33:01] <%Ferdiee92> Religion is the cause of all problem in the world
[2022-12-11 14:33:02] <%Regnory> @FullMetalOmar You say so, but some of the religions do stat that these are the only ways to live and other religions is not correct etc. (Which makes these believe in one way only and live by the rules of the religion and wants family/friends to do the same)

[2022-12-11 14:36:29] <@%skibbatv> he meant "and that's just one person (that we know of)" It's maybe british thing Annie
[2022-12-11 14:36:29] <%drzaius30> they call it Honour killing its disgusting
[2022-12-11 14:36:30] <%$Mordotzz> Thats actually true, i heard several muslim women who dated a swedish guy, who were killed
[2022-12-11 14:36:32] <ChedaPlays> its Real, on Balkans we have also them..
[2022-12-11 14:36:36] <Chymerical> What's the topic? Seems serious.
[2022-12-11 14:36:36] <+MrKhanes> yeah its a problem. With heders relaterat violence here in Sweden.
[2022-12-11 14:36:38] <%TGMDK> i wasn't here from the start... may i ask why we are talking about this subject?
[2022-12-11 14:36:38] <%Wardrick7> he did say he meant there is many more cases
[2022-12-11 14:36:41] <1randomtrooper> all this in the name of the religion ist crazy..
[2022-12-11 14:36:48] <$RasmusSW> Yeah, either way, you are correct

[2022-12-11 14:37:34] <%Regnory> @FullMetalOmar Indeed! This is the way I lived (Tho one half of my grandparents did exactly the same stuff to me, regarding christian religion, but luckily I was never forced by my other side of the family.. Only some)

[2022-12-11 14:38:43] <bentl1jk> I wish the US would outlaw religion
[2022-12-11 14:38:44] <%mystlineid> Religion is poison
[2022-12-11 14:38:46] <+noshizm8> as a human race we should move past religion. It's a thing of the past and doesn't belong in a modern world. Religion should be illegal.
[2022-12-11 14:38:51] <MushiVG> Religion and having faith in something is two very different things.
[2022-12-11 14:38:55] <%drzaius30> i didn't need religion to be a good person
[2022-12-11 14:38:55] <%SinRedblade> @bentl1jk got more chance of them banning guns
[2022-12-11 14:38:56] <%oddjobthebob> It means that most religions die.
[2022-12-11 14:39:00] <virtuafix> John Lennon suggested that too
[2022-12-11 14:39:02] <WilX> you don't need religion to be a good person
[2022-12-11 14:39:02] <+Theguywhodoneit> we existed for over a million years as a species without religion just fine
[2022-12-11 14:39:03] <%Morgonbladet> @rand0202 But what's common between them is that you sacrifice time thinking about it/practicing it, why force that on kids
[2022-12-11 14:39:03] <%drzaius30> i found that on my own
[2022-12-11 14:39:05] <jay_t34> nah fuck all religions, my grandparent tried so hard to indoctrinate me into Christianity
[2022-12-11 14:39:05] <%Collnaris> A lot of wars are based on religious beliefs
[2022-12-11 14:39:10] <+illydan2513> you can be perfectly fine without so many things but doesn't mean they are bad for definition :)
[2022-12-11 14:39:11] <+Grovpie> I am of the belief that religion is fine as long as you don't force your beliefs onto others and your beliefs don't harm others

[2022-12-11 14:39:34] <%+harvenger01> @AnnieFuchsia I do see some people that use religion as sort of a moral guide, Im not sure if this is a good thing or not tho

[2022-12-11 14:39:46] <%LemonDrizzleCakes> You'll always have bad examples in everything, but banning it for people who only get positives out of it is denying their freedom
[2022-12-11 14:39:47] <StayneAlive> religion is in its purest form a good thing - the problem is when it is used as a tool for oppression or control
[2022-12-11 14:39:49] <Silverilion> By the Light of Eluuuune....
[2022-12-11 14:39:51] <nekrojiji> religion is only good when it's used for ease of mind.... else it's bad
[2022-12-11 14:39:52] <numberone0092> all religion should be banned its an anchient way to live
[2022-12-11 14:39:58] <%Wardrick7> there is a reason many kids stop being religious after becoming 18+
[2022-12-11 14:39:59] <+Kai_Khang> They can make up their own minds when they are an adult
[2022-12-11 14:39:59] <+Akenzx> @anniefuchsia this is my first time watching and I think you’re awesome
[2022-12-11 14:40:05] <KawariDrood> My sister became religious after my nephew had a brain injury and almost died. It was, for her, something to hold onto and believe in when they as a family were going through a trash time. Her church seems to be modern and not impose their beliefs on others which I can respect. I'm an athiest myself, but it helped her get through some of the worst years of her life, so in that regard, it was good.
[2022-12-11 14:40:12] <prod_aybee> agree 100%
[2022-12-11 14:40:18] <%Collnaris> yep
[2022-12-11 14:40:23] <@%skibbatv> FeelsOkayMan We need a legal definition of a cult, and make it an umbrella term for all belief systems
[2022-12-11 14:40:23] <Mightybeast204> Im happy my parents are not religious but still celebrate christmas and stuff like that, but have never forced religion  on me and my siblings.
[2022-12-11 14:40:26] <Lord_stuba> Yes Religion can help people, but denying it is causing a lot of harm around the world is nits

[2022-12-11 14:40:32] <Kalrihk> tbh I just wish that when the place I live in would stick by the idea that "religion and state are separate" since they still outlaw alcohol sales on sunday, but the next state over allows 24/7 sales

[2022-12-11 14:41:00] <+fathomlordcrunch> my issues with religon seems to be they are male dominated, rules around how women should live there life according to a man etc.

[2022-12-11 14:41:20] <%foggyfr> Yeah I agree to, it would be much healthier to introduce kids to all religion growing up and let them decide there feelings at 18. But banning religion would cause a lot of issues ?

[2022-12-11 14:42:48] <Kalrihk> basically, dont expose children to content until they wish to explore that content and are of an age where they can make their own decisions for themselves
[2022-12-11 14:42:49] <+illydan2513> saying you can't do something which has no harm (not gambling, not drinking alcohol) is forcing someone to do something :P which is what you ppl are saying religion does...

[2022-12-11 14:43:57] <%foggyfr> Yeah even that is so difficult though, for us in the western world separating ourselves from religion is easy. But for a culture that exist around a religion, to all of sudden tell a culture to change. Is really difficult to do

[2022-12-11 14:46:05] <%Bitfrost9> it needs to start with change from the parenting, not forceful ban on religious customs.

[2022-12-11 14:46:07] <WhatTheWoda> I don't think there is a good answer to this one. I am in favour of banning any religious items in School or other just for the sake of a secular state. This being said, the freedom of practicing should be also protected and this could be used as a tool in order to rain down on people that have religious beliefs. Now to which extend this could work is a bit dicey.

[2022-12-11 14:48:25] <%Bitfrost9> the problem with trying to answer the question is that it attracts people from both far ends of the spectrum. you will see people aggressively defend their religion then yoou will get racists and anti religion extremists also involved.

[2022-12-11 14:50:19] <%foggyfr> @jay_t34 I'm using the term "western world" to describe our very atheist day an age. Countries like the US, EU, Canada, Australia etc. Christians may still do fucked up shit in our day an age, but its much less of an issue now days. To do the same for a country like Egypt. Will take much time.

[2022-12-11 15:07:03] <%+snagprophet> @AnnieFuchsia its weird that blizzard thought people would quit if they werent forced to farm constantly
[2022-12-11 15:07:03] <+Kai_Khang> People are ok with 1 grind just not 10
[2022-12-11 15:07:07] <plumpyowl> when you want to return to a game why do you need someone else approving, like if you ask that question you never wanted to play the game in the first place

[2022-12-11 15:07:37] <+Doomlace> I think the issue was having to grind it all out on alts each time.
[2022-12-11 15:07:47] <cablamo1> Thats because the rewards for AP, legendaries and relics are good rewards and in BFA it was just shitty azerite traits that barely upped your dps

[2022-12-11 15:43:40] <%KalleEinar> @anniefuchsia I would recommend waiting and looking at the animal before snapping to see if they do something instead of snapping as soon as you see something
[2022-12-11 15:43:40] <CeipeCG> perhaps take a shot when they have an aura around them
[2022-12-11 15:43:40] <%Grovpie> Mobs interacting with each other or yawning or something
