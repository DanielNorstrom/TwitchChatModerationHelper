[2022-12-11 08:56:19] <Cryten0> @scifs104 see the number of attempts? I would say of that 3972 only about 300-400 got out of lab and 100 got past brock

[2022-12-11 10:25:18] <thelargeone> A question I've been afraid to ask about is your sleep schedule
[2022-12-11 10:25:22] <ryzpr> Do you sleep during the day? Bc you stream till 8am
[2022-12-11 10:25:53] <ocyc> surprisingly decent lab mon

[2022-12-11 10:26:49] <%PawsitivelyClawsome> my schedule is fucked i was day shift schedule for a while but im off work until new year so i woke up at 4pm today

[2022-12-11 10:26:54] <%compiling> More like Austranian sleep schedule, yeah.
[2022-12-11 10:27:00] <CaniisMajor> lot of my american friends share eu sleep schedule just for twitch
[2022-12-11 10:27:00] <Worldwide_Wimpy> you have a japanese schedule since jp midnight is 10am EST
[2022-12-11 10:27:00] <%TalenLee> here in Australia, you start streaming at our dinner time and you're wrapping up at midnight, it's pretty consistent
[2022-12-11 10:27:03] <@%fsvgm777> (10:26 AM for me, as a note)
[2022-12-11 10:27:03] <+Plaigu> Nah you just shut off when the stream is off and power back on when you turn it on. No sleep schedule needed lsrSass
[2022-12-11 10:27:06] <LordMeowsies> yeah I'm from western Europe and for some dumb reason I assumed you had the same working hours as me
[2022-12-11 10:27:12] <ryzpr> Why do you have that schedule? Any particular reason?
[2022-12-11 10:27:16] <ecceweirdo> do you go to sleep after stream!
[2022-12-11 10:27:19] <%uneseulenuit> my gf and i (central time) both get up between 2-4pm and go to bed at 6-7am, hence why this stream ends up being what we watch most lol

[2022-12-11 11:52:57] <thelargeone> pokemon is a series founded on logic and reasoning
[2022-12-11 11:53:12] <Worldwide_Wimpy> you get heat lightning in the Arizona desert
[2022-12-11 11:53:12] <yoshiha12> wyoming is the only fake state
[2022-12-11 11:53:17] <WaIes> pay 2 win hair smh
[2022-12-11 11:53:20] <%+Izandai> New hair who dis?
[2022-12-11 11:53:26] <clockworkpiece> texas is an imported fantasy world, it has 11 grow zones
[2022-12-11 11:53:50] <+ATOMSIMZ> A lot, in Florida
[2022-12-11 11:54:08] <%+Izandai> You never see thunder. Thunder is a sound. You can't see sound. :)
[2022-12-11 11:54:14] <CynthiaKnight> its less likely... like the move is less likely to hit
[2022-12-11 11:54:17] <CaniisMajor> Basically never
[2022-12-11 11:54:17] <fingolfin987> I've never seen thunder in rain to be fair

[2022-12-11 11:54:34] <@%$CarloBrown> not often
[2022-12-11 11:54:39] <dsmokx> I can't see thunder
[2022-12-11 11:54:41] <Worldwide_Wimpy> by that logic it would make more sense for thunder to have a boost in accuracy during sand storm because lightning is caused by soil particles in the clouds
[2022-12-11 11:54:57] <%endrift> I don't think that's accurare
[2022-12-11 11:55:00] <yoshiha12> i've never seen superman and vaporeon in the same room

[2022-12-11 11:55:29] <%endrift> It's caused by a massive discrepancy in electric charge between the ground and the clouds. What causes that charge discrepancy I'm not sure
[2022-12-11 11:55:32] <KenOutOfTen> It should
[2022-12-11 11:55:33] <PyroJakk> ...Yet

[2022-12-11 13:19:26] <%firin_bot> LUL LUL i have your skill swap in 20 levels faster depending on the cyclist player or just noticed 4am here, but considering dewgong's 26 defense at least run would be dugtrio? i kinda not arts; science, not doing it so that's tech :p B)

[2022-12-11 13:19:36] <%$Kailaria> it could be one of those linear types of seeds with (spitballing) 15 spheres, so 7 would be generous in that case. But if it's wide open, 7 is probably last sphere or doesn't exist

[2022-12-11 13:28:43] <iphaedos> I love the bomb jumps in this game
[2022-12-11 13:28:49] <%+Fio_Hart> that was like... one of the best paradox's ive seen
[2022-12-11 13:28:49] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis 👉 🍏
[2022-12-11 13:28:52] <@%ori_sky> no no just like the bow in paradox
[2022-12-11 13:28:57] <@%ori_sky> since you'd run out of bombs for the top floor
[2022-12-11 13:29:24] <%compiling> Yeah, I would have done Aginah after Eastern as well.
[2022-12-11 13:29:32] <@%ori_sky> no no I'm just saying like it was funny you got bow right at the time you needed it for the top floor for the crystal switch, that was all
[2022-12-11 13:30:11] <@%ori_sky> sorry I'm not enunciating myself I'm really sleepy today

[2022-12-11 13:31:34] <%AstralStorm> or something
[2022-12-11 13:31:35] <@%ori_sky> duke and/or ice tried to teach me once
[2022-12-11 13:31:37] <%AstralStorm> !bullshi
[2022-12-11 13:31:43] <@%ori_sky> I didn't understand and they couldn't teach me
[2022-12-11 13:31:43] <@%ori_sky> lmao
[2022-12-11 13:31:52] <Ezzlin> Except maybe the hardest tech you say
[2022-12-11 13:32:00] <@%ori_sky> duke did teach me icebreaker at least, and I *think* diver down too?
[2022-12-11 13:32:32] <@%ori_sky> diver down is a real weird one, it has a sort of intuition to it
[2022-12-11 13:32:33] <%compiling> They are new glitches.  You need to learn them and then do them a bunch of times.
[2022-12-11 13:32:50] <%compiling> Plus, they are banned in the vanilla speedrun so you wouldn't learn them for that.
[2022-12-11 13:33:05] <Worldwide_Wimpy> fair enough teej ^^
[2022-12-11 13:33:07] <Jhanees> does logic include some glitches?
[2022-12-11 13:33:13] <@%ori_sky> in the smz3 last night I spent like
[2022-12-11 13:33:15] <Worldwide_Wimpy> if you want any help with them just ask ^
[2022-12-11 13:33:20] <@%ori_sky> 2m trying to remember how to do it properly
[2022-12-11 13:33:39] <+CasualGamerNY> mark hookshot too
[2022-12-11 13:33:40] <%+einlanzer625> hookshot and bombos missing from tracker too
[2022-12-11 13:33:46] <Worldwide_Wimpy> of course ^^
[2022-12-11 13:34:07] <%compiling> The logic does not include glitches (other than silverless ganon)
[2022-12-11 13:34:44] <Ezzlin> I don't think it even has silverless ganon in logic
[2022-12-11 13:34:48] <@%ori_sky> I need to relearn uhhh, whatever it's called
[2022-12-11 13:34:55] <@%ori_sky> fake flipper water walk at some point
[2022-12-11 13:35:05] <%+einlanzer625> is desert a pendant?
[2022-12-11 13:35:10] <dsmokx> which items are essential to beat the game?
[2022-12-11 13:35:12] <%compiling> In beatable only mode, they might not be available.
[2022-12-11 13:35:19] <Ezzlin> Unless you set the seed to beatable is the only exception yeah
[2022-12-11 13:35:31] <@%ori_sky> I thought silvers are always available in beatable
[2022-12-11 13:35:40] <@%ori_sky> because logically they're required for ganon
[2022-12-11 13:35:53] <%+Falcon9012> I just noticed u had green hair
[2022-12-11 13:35:55] <%compiling> They are not required for Ganon unless you do basic.
[2022-12-11 13:35:57] <Ezzlin> Or hard/expert item pool also don't give you silvers
[2022-12-11 13:36:11] <%Draggo__x3> !bullshi

[2022-12-11 13:37:18] <@%ori_sky> I need to learn hammer jump
[2022-12-11 13:37:21] <@%ori_sky> I never have
[2022-12-11 13:37:31] <%+einlanzer625> @arijentof its pokemon triforce
[2022-12-11 13:37:54] <%compiling> If you play keysanity, hammerjump extremely useful.  In other modes, it's a small time save.
[2022-12-11 13:38:06] <%compiling> It still looks cool though.
[2022-12-11 13:39:11] <%compiling> True, it is a pretty big time save if the items line up so that you can loop around once.
[2022-12-11 13:39:26] <%+einlanzer625> was that vanilla bk?
[2022-12-11 13:39:30] <%JustifiedBasser> yes

[2022-12-11 14:38:23] <%$Kailaria> firin's getting high on its own supply
[2022-12-11 14:38:33] <%Superbaas88> in my past 10 seeds I've gotten 2 lamps, 3 fire rods, 2 boots, and flippers

[2022-12-11 14:40:27] <%Superbaas88> can be a lot more than that if the front is double key
[2022-12-11 14:40:45] <%compiling> Theoretically, the fire rod could be on laser bridge.
[2022-12-11 14:40:53] <%OckE93> LOL
[2022-12-11 14:40:54] <%compiling> Or it can be right there.

[2022-12-11 14:44:05] <+tankredde> The floor is the real boss in that room
[2022-12-11 14:44:09] <%Superbaas88> my first 3 seeds in a row all threw me at moth in green mail on 6 hearts, so the boss always fills me with anxiety from those days
