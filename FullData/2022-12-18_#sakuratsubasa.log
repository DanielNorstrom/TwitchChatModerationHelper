[2022-12-18 05:58:25] <~%SakuraTsubasa> Crowd Control is a Twitch Extension that lets you interact with a streamer's gameplay! Exchange Bits for Coins (through the extension) and take control of the game: send them power ups, invert their D-Pad and much more! To join in the fun, make sure you enable the extension by clicking on the grey wrench in the center-bottom of the video feed overlay, then REFRESH and the extension should appear on the top left of the video feed. Have fun!

Exchange Bits for Coins (through the extension) and take control of the game: send them power ups, invert their D-Pad and much more! To join in the fun, make sure you enable the extension by clicking on the grey wrench in the center-bottom of the video feed overlay, then REFRESH and the extension should appear on the top left of the video feed. Have fun!

[2022-12-18 07:20:06] <~%SakuraTsubasa> Crowd Control is a Twitch Extension that lets you interact with a streamer's gameplay! Exchange Bits for Coins (through the extension) and take control of the game: send them power ups, invert their D-Pad and much more! To join in the fun, make sure you enable the extension by clicking on the grey wrench in the center-bottom of the video feed overlay, then REFRESH and the extension should appear on the top left of the video feed. Have fun!

[2022-12-18 07:32:21] <%MeZmYk> Basically anywhere.
[2022-12-18 07:32:35] <%Norfar377> only some chests are safe
[2022-12-18 07:32:38] <@%+Skarthe> I think pretty much any container that isn't in a dungeon should be safe
[2022-12-18 07:32:48] <@%+Skarthe> Chests in dungeons are *not* safe usually because dungeons can be repopulated
[2022-12-18 07:32:50] <AscendingAscension> I always used the whiterun house as my storage
[2022-12-18 07:32:52] <@%+clrblbread> I think some areas reset, so dungeons are not safe. But overworld places are usually okay?
[2022-12-18 07:33:31] <!%$cybertyche> Remember, "SakuraTsubasa" is Japanese for "grave robber"
[2022-12-18 07:33:33] <@%+Skarthe> You could probably safely store stuff back in Alvor and Gerdur's house in Riverwood

[2022-12-18 07:35:14] <%Norfar377> u need charges to use the enchantment
[2022-12-18 07:35:26] <$Phant0mGenesis> Still works as a weapon, needs energy for the enchantment
[2022-12-18 07:35:33] <@%+Skarthe> Your weapon has a Frost Damage enchantment on it
[2022-12-18 07:35:38] VIEWERS: 98
[2022-12-18 07:35:51] <@%+Skarthe> It's still usable as a sword, it just won't do the Frost damage until recharged.

[2022-12-18 08:38:33] <@%+Skarthe> There are different merchants who buy and sell different things; I want to say Whiterun has three blacksmiths (weapons / armor), an alchemits (potions, etc.) and so on.

[2022-12-18 08:39:05] <@%+Skarthe> That stuff usually is going to require a general store, and I think Belethor might be the only one in Whiterun, but there are plenty of others in other towns.

[2022-12-18 08:57:09] <@%+Skarthe> I mean, even if she has the ingots, she still wouldn't have the gold to do it anyway, because dying took away all of the gold she was given.

[2022-12-18 09:44:10] <%+Zithras2> in general, if you get 50% of the value, you're doing pretty good - there's some items that can raise it a bit above 100%, but skills basically top out at 50%
[2022-12-18 09:44:11] <@%$EsponMyst> Sternum?
[2022-12-18 09:44:16] <%ROT8> Septum is part of the nose iirc
[2022-12-18 09:44:51] <@%+Skarthe> (the previous dynasty of emperors was the Septim family, so they named the coins after them, and it stuck around even after they died off)
[2022-12-18 09:44:55] <!%$cybertyche> A septum is like a separation, as @ROT8 said the nose is an example
[2022-12-18 09:45:10] <%+Zithras2> Theres fixed spawn dragons, and random ones too.  The random ones are pretty rare though
[2022-12-18 09:45:18] <@%+Skarthe> But no, you don't have to do anything special to spawn dragons, they'll generally just show up as you wander.
[2022-12-18 09:45:25] <%+Zithras2> unless someone spends coins, but I'm not saure if the crowd control dragons will give you powers

[2022-12-18 09:58:21] <@%+k3vlar12> if you explore outside of cities, you should find plenty
[2022-12-18 09:58:28] <!%$cybertyche> How do you find a dungeon? Well, you start with Craig's List in the back pages...

[2022-12-18 09:58:53] <@%+k3vlar12> most of the quest lines will take you through or end with a dungeon
