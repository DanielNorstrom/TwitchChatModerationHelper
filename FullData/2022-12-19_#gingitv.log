[2022-12-19 00:04:18] <Na_is_go0der_than_eu> Race is so close both teams might go 20 hours
[2022-12-19 00:04:18] <+ToAndFrom> less than an hour probably
[2022-12-19 00:04:24] <leotherastv> @TwentySixO they thought about popping 3 ELX and do allnighter

[2022-12-19 00:05:08] <DrushQQ> Wouldn't it be better to go to sleep early, to keep a healthy rythm for 5am wednesday splits and a kill after nerf ^^ not like that has happen before, hrhm

[2022-12-19 00:06:00] <+Soeee> @DrushQQ they really want to kill it now, to get a few tries and research on raz.
[2022-12-19 00:06:03] <+hectabit> @DrushQQ only if you are fine losing the race
[2022-12-19 00:06:04] <+ToAndFrom> no way rasz drops this reset
[2022-12-19 00:06:07] <JustTrim> the silence is real
[2022-12-19 00:06:10] <DrushQQ> @hiwago When 2d to last boss is a gear check, I highly doubt it
[2022-12-19 00:06:21] <+GIGACHAD_OF_GIGACHADS> if last boss does not die till reset, liquid might win cuz of time advantage

[2022-12-19 00:53:57] <@Fierced> @UKNplayeer yeah part of the strat to lose a tank on a pull YEP ofc its not a strat.. he just gets trucked.
[2022-12-19 00:53:58] <Blut103> @AapeeTTV yes but EU is gonna prevail anyway GIGACHAD
[2022-12-19 00:54:03] <ollyisbored> @AapeeTTV that's not how it works
[2022-12-19 00:54:13] <Football_Coach> @AapeeTTV usually we don't take timezone advantages into account... whoever downs it first, wins.
[2022-12-19 00:54:14] <+syukaan1> @AapeeTTV nah since they pretty much trialed the raid fighting through all the bugs
[2022-12-19 00:54:17] <Mysteel> @Mekftw liquid did it tho with late lust
[2022-12-19 00:54:23] <swiftyisthereason> always the healers FailFish

[2022-12-19 00:54:31] <+TheGamingUndertaker> its not totally unfair as liquid always hits bosses that are unkillable and bugged where they loose that gain
[2022-12-19 00:54:37] <LeNightmare99> yea, it’s unfair, CN server opens two days later

[2022-12-19 00:58:19] <Football_Coach> @FluidExtractor the advantage isn't as big as you think. By going first, Liquid kinda has to pave the way for each fight, and Echo is able to learn from it. Pros and Cons for each region. It's not unfair i think.

[2022-12-19 01:04:46] <%Poochymama> ahh, ok, so at least they don't just lose those hours so it's not as bad as losing 16 hours. That's better, but still seems better to have your extra hours frontloaded rather than backloaded, especially if the boss survives the reset and Liquid can go in with Vault loot

[2022-12-19 01:07:27] <mawwisthename> Liquid started on 22% soon as they woke up which had them motivated and energized, echo started on kurog grimtotem, killed him. Then moved on to 100% diurna and got her down to 1.2% already. I mean it makes sense they are falling down now in performance considering how late it is and how long they have played for today

[2022-12-19 01:10:00] <%brezzywrld> @mawwisthename Thats not even being toxic, just a fact lol.
[2022-12-19 01:10:00] <FluidExtractor> @mawwisthename People are just incapable of reading messages that are 5+ words long so they instead trash talk longer ones lol
[2022-12-19 01:10:03] <bearshy> 1.2% is their best
[2022-12-19 01:10:06] <%Nakujin_> @sarug 1,2%

[2022-12-19 01:11:27] <kevnar> @Supbroo if it was only about going to na to play they would do it, but they also need to make 10 new characters each and gear them on na servers, and remember people have 15+ years of investments into their eu accounts so its not that simple
[2022-12-19 01:11:31] <%+IMrWatson> Rasz fight is really cool imo
[2022-12-19 01:11:31] <Nanny> idk, we have a tier with no walls before last boss, kinda dissapointed about that
[2022-12-19 01:11:34] <sarug> minat0cs spirits still high or bedgee time ?
[2022-12-19 01:11:34] <realdevv> Liquid should cut their streams so Echo has nothing to research when they wake up, its the only smart move.

[2022-12-19 01:11:42] <azrakk1993> I like the mechanics on this boss

[2022-12-19 01:12:12] <Supbroo> @kevnar u didnt read - i referenced someone elses comment.
[2022-12-19 01:12:13] <ollyisbored> @Supbroo 15 years of 'investment' means nothing for RWF though? your achievements etc don't matter, i get it'd be annoying having to gear new characters but its not the most difficult thing for players that play at this level
[2022-12-19 01:12:18] <Cinocchio> @kevnar I guess Blizzard can move their character if that was really happening...don't you think?
[2022-12-19 01:12:18] <Minimoza> If they're dying the last few %, why not lust at like 10% or something? any reason?
[2022-12-19 01:12:22] <realdevv> @Fierced Not sure why my comment was timed out, its the logical strategy.
[2022-12-19 01:12:25] <@Fierced> @Mysteel theyve done pulls off stream aswell. both guilds do it if t hey think of something clever.
[2022-12-19 01:12:30] <@Fierced> @realdevv wasnt me bud.
[2022-12-19 01:12:31] <Lazyawpsilver123> i got banned from max chat because i asked: "do you think its fair liquid starts before echo" XDDDD
[2022-12-19 01:12:32] <Moethelion> @realdevv by that logic the only smart move would be to not streams at all
[2022-12-19 01:12:34] <%+weeddealerzzz> @realdevv well that’s the disadvantage of starting early.

[2022-12-19 01:13:19] <@Fierced> @Lazyawpsilver123 funny dude, everyone that watches this and knows both guilds knows that they both want it to be released globally, NA didnt ask for the head start.

[2022-12-19 01:14:06] <Lazyawpsilver123> @driftrockz Give me a good argument for its a bad question
[2022-12-19 01:14:10] <@Fierced> Its like your boss tells you to show up to work at 9, and people come by and ask you '' man everyone else starts at x, why dont you! ''

[2022-12-19 01:18:25] <Xeneron> Basically exactly what happened with Liquid. Lots of sub 5% wipes before the kill. It's super tight.
[2022-12-19 01:18:30] <dixine> just wait with lust?
[2022-12-19 01:18:38] <Qemist> @Sackenx you're right

[2022-12-19 01:18:51] <Itmyfault69> @dixine they would have to re-work some CD's and stuff with moving lust

[2022-12-19 01:19:15] <naagooth> I like that Naowhlul is 4th healer as a tank xD
[2022-12-19 01:19:18] <%greyfnc> why are they not bringing in another mage tho? wouldnt that be better?
[2022-12-19 01:19:19] <+Bazzzel> You want to kill now wake up fresh for raz preferably
[2022-12-19 01:19:34] <bearfukuu> Raz has to die this reset imo, it seems like the gear for next clear is going to make it so much easier
[2022-12-19 01:19:34] <deviljin____> Echo gains nothing from killing this tonight, Idk why they insist on it. Just rest up and get an ez kill in morning
[2022-12-19 01:19:35] <Lumimyrsky> I'm surprised there's no resto druid though.
[2022-12-19 01:19:41] <sebek815> @Lukasgate look, some student has a prop gun, oh wait, IM in America, classic :) fyi this will be banned :) L2P

[2022-12-19 01:19:49] <+aocAorus> Somehow Meeres always dies sub 25% its almost mandatory to keep at least one Br on that phase
[2022-12-19 01:19:49] <+nocopypasterino0> @greyfnc and why exactly?
[2022-12-19 01:19:49] [Notification] karle1989 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2022-12-19 01:19:57] <bearfukuu> @deviljin____ A good night sleep with 2 days for raz means alot
[2022-12-19 01:20:01] <@Fierced> @Lumimyrsky resto druids dont tend to be great raid healers
[2022-12-19 01:20:08] <+nordicboi28> Hm frusttraded?:/
[2022-12-19 01:20:14] <Football_Coach> @deviljin____ sleep would probably feel better if they got 7/8... otherwise they'll go to bed slightly more worried
[2022-12-19 01:20:20] <Jepper> @sebek815 holy fk dude, you are actually the lowest of the low on earth
[2022-12-19 01:20:22] <Lumimyrsky> @Fierced Welp, time for me to re-roll then LUL
[2022-12-19 01:20:31] <%greyfnc> @nocopypasterino0 cause it would be most likely a 20K+ dps increase compared to other classes at the bottom
[2022-12-19 01:20:32] <%justkeepinreal> 2 days will be enough for echo to kill raz
[2022-12-19 01:20:46] <+syukaan1> @Lukasgate how is this not timed out lmao
[2022-12-19 01:20:49] <%justkeepinreal> unless raz needs more ilvl overall
[2022-12-19 01:20:54] <+KaupTV> well I guess its a done deal then huh @justkeepinreal wrap it up folks, race over
[2022-12-19 01:20:54] <%Poochymama> I think they should keep going. They're so close and sleeping on 7/8 will energize them
[2022-12-19 01:20:56] <@Fierced> @Lumimyrsky if youre in a non pusher guild you'll be just fine.

[2022-12-19 01:21:12] <Itmyfault69> @dixine yea, its odd because they were lusting on last 2 proto-adds around 60% health on Broodkeeper. I trust Scripe thinking this might be the right play but who knows
[2022-12-19 01:21:12] <+nocopypasterino0> @greyfnc then why not bring an another monk or druid?  They are way better in this fight
[2022-12-19 01:21:13] <A_Trask> So many health spikes and deaths, wonder if another pally so Skaris gets wings aura towards the end

[2022-12-19 01:22:11] <Lumimyrsky> @Fierced Nah we're pretty laid back, I did consider re-rolling though. 17 years as a resto druid made is a bit bland.

[2022-12-19 01:22:34] <%greyfnc> @nocopypasterino0 was thinking at a mage as most likely fleks could join and there are no other geared monks i assume
[2022-12-19 01:22:36] <@Fierced> @Lumimyrsky theyre doing really  well now though,  keys especially

[2022-12-19 01:25:24] <+DeadlyIIII> i wonder where they are losing dmg, they phase it at 55% while limit did at 60%
[2022-12-19 01:25:30] <bearfukuu> too early death in lust is dead for sure
[2022-12-19 01:25:32] <+CerealSatouri> More Boomkins
[2022-12-19 01:25:40] <+syukaan1> @DeadlyIIII limit saved lust for 35%
[2022-12-19 01:25:47] <bearfukuu> @DeadlyIIII Limit used lust later
[2022-12-19 01:25:55] <Nanny> too many deaths aswell too early
[2022-12-19 01:26:10] <ruediruempel> @syukaan1 lust is also a healer cd, on the start its not needed for healer or am i wrong?
[2022-12-19 01:26:16] <+holyfeed5> !best
[2022-12-19 01:26:19] <%+xponwow> @Nanny they had 1???
[2022-12-19 01:26:24] <%greyfnc> man some of these fights in this raid is crazy for healers
[2022-12-19 01:26:28] <+holyfeed5> !bestpull
[2022-12-19 01:26:33] <bearfukuu> It's late people are tired, it's DOA in the morning for sure. Just nice to get it done today
[2022-12-19 01:26:37] <+syukaan1> @ruediruempel I was just answering his question
[2022-12-19 01:26:39] <%+ushio96> healers having fun lol
[2022-12-19 01:26:46] <UnavailableLUL> 65k hps on a tank blood is so cracked
[2022-12-19 01:26:47] <%Poochymama> what timezone are they in?
[2022-12-19 01:26:48] <Lumimyrsky> @greyfnc I've only done normal so far, but healing these fights are pretty good fun xD
[2022-12-19 01:26:56] <satareel> @holyfeed5 its 1.2% dude jsut look at the screen
[2022-12-19 01:26:56] <yishiwucheng> !bestpull
[2022-12-19 01:27:05] <devilbride> @bearfukuu true story. but after 15+ hrs live on stream i guess there is alot of accident by being tired
[2022-12-19 01:27:05] <+CerealSatouri> More Boomkins MORE
[2022-12-19 01:27:26] <ruediruempel> @UnavailableLUL its because of bone shield. On warrior for example shield block doesnt count as healing for blood it kinda does
[2022-12-19 01:27:28] <certified86> @Poochymama it's 1.27 am here in switzerland
[2022-12-19 01:27:32] <Football_Coach> no more boomkins :( too much
[2022-12-19 01:27:50] <bearfukuu> @devilbride for sure, this has to be last pull and just smash after a good breakfeast tomorrow. But the breakfast tastes better if this boss is dead when you wake up
[2022-12-19 01:28:12] <matotheace> why are they delaying sleep schedule so much. its not even last boss. im not sure its worth it

[2022-12-19 01:28:45] <@Fierced> It would feel like that when the exp is about dragons.
[2022-12-19 01:28:56] <ruediruempel> Echo has way more dps. Echo is p2 at 56%, Liquid was at like 59%
[2022-12-19 01:28:57] <sengokusehn> but 100 times harder xD!
[2022-12-19 01:29:09] <@Fierced> @matotheace thats what they want to do. have 2 full days on razzy

[2022-12-19 01:29:28] <%Poochymama> @ruediruempel that's because they lusted
[2022-12-19 01:29:30] <@Fierced> @ruediruempel theyre doing a diff tactic aswell though
[2022-12-19 01:29:32] <FENIXHAZE10> @ruediruempel they were at 53 at kill Jebaited
[2022-12-19 01:29:36] <devilbride> @bearfukuu I feel what you mean and I feel their wish to go to bed with the kill.. Even if they will have sleepless night, they should try it again tomorrow after a few rested hours..
[2022-12-19 01:29:47] <+s_thetic_steve> @ruediruempel yeah im not sure i like hero on pull but im not the expert like them lol

[2022-12-19 14:06:00] <+DonGavlar> @jordann93 right... lol
[2022-12-19 14:06:08] <hiwago> Popoga
[2022-12-19 14:06:08] <lakers2324> ive already killed this boss, this is race to world second
[2022-12-19 14:06:08] <Mom__hadi> You think they have a chance to kill it before reset?
[2022-12-19 14:06:17] <+mmathiaspre> @MincoXD bruh, I´ve watched games before I know everything there is bruh
[2022-12-19 14:06:24] <jordann93> and i think by my calculation they will kill it before or after reset
[2022-12-19 14:06:24] <Rytme> I mean… it surely has to die before christmas right?
[2022-12-19 14:06:24] <+pDLjay> Isn’t there this leather working tent which is solid and could stop the pushback or is that an exploit?
[2022-12-19 14:06:26] <realdevv> @naughtyforyou They need to make content more accesible not harder, there is a reason Classic has like 150k per class and retail has like 2k per class on WCL on average.
[2022-12-19 14:06:29] <Mom__hadi> I ment lock the save before the reset
[2022-12-19 14:06:37] <ValectriGaming> Imagina ele shaman here :V
[2022-12-19 14:06:38] <hiwago> @Mom__hadi its about 2 days of raiding left before reset, only time will tell ..
[2022-12-19 14:06:51] <Zantro> all final raid bosses were killed after reset
[2022-12-19 14:06:56] <lakers2324> blizz gonna hard nerf this fight so it dies by christmas KEKW
[2022-12-19 14:07:00] <jordann93> theres a fifty fifty chance they killed it next pull
[2022-12-19 14:07:05] <luke____> @realdevv but LFR is more accessible than classic? the problem is that retail is just trash
[2022-12-19 14:07:15] <+margothon> @Zantro why lie bruh
[2022-12-19 14:07:15] <+adenix_> @zantro not sylvanas
[2022-12-19 14:07:17] <+suzzzzzzzzzzzzzz> Gingi comes to kill bosses and chew gum, but hes allllll ouuut of gum
[2022-12-19 14:07:20] <+mmathiaspre> @jordann93 thats not how math works though
[2022-12-19 14:07:21] <jabbeerawr> did u see the classic player numbers? they huge.
[2022-12-19 14:07:22] <Mom__hadi> @hiwago that’s why i asked , do they usually lock the save or start mythic from scratch
[2022-12-19 14:07:22] <ValectriGaming> They will reclear or extend?

[2022-12-19 14:10:17] <jordann93> i really think they are either gonna kill it before this reset or after this reset!
[2022-12-19 14:10:24] <+Luke03097> @jordann93 its always 50%
[2022-12-19 14:10:36] <dzreams> How on earth does that priest deal with the pusback?
[2022-12-19 14:10:43] <+Earendil2021> Hope they can kill it before us reset
[2022-12-19 14:10:47] <jordann93> if they dont kill it before the reset then i think itll be after reset!!
[2022-12-19 14:10:48] <+KelesethWoW> warlock gate
[2022-12-19 14:11:03] <+Horstelchen> bad 50% this time
[2022-12-19 14:11:06] <+margothon> do priests still have the reverse grip, pulling them to player?
[2022-12-19 14:11:08] <jordann93> or maybe they kill it during reset?
[2022-12-19 14:11:13] <dzreams> Just the gate? It looks like gingi has to use the gate and a mobility spell to beat it?

[2022-12-19 14:33:39] <Ashreen> maybe they just test it with programmed bots

[2022-12-19 14:33:58] <bendib2003> @transienttuna They have tools to change starting point, give invulnerability etc, they don't have to complete the fight in it's entirety to test it properly

[2022-12-19 14:40:09] <FluffyFloofer> @Setx In general, if people without any knowledge checks in to the stream, having no sound or comms on isn't the best to retain or gain viewers if you care to also make an income streaming this and seeing as they have sponsors more viewers = better
[2022-12-19 14:40:15] <areyoudrunkorwhat> @swordoffeastandfamine no pull yet

[2022-12-19 14:41:08] <garoundar> does the Monk stream?
[2022-12-19 14:41:09] <ot_index> Uhm
[2022-12-19 14:41:21] <+Setx> Dude they are gonna win anyway
[2022-12-19 14:41:22] <dungeonmasterdave85> they are streaming because they want the views (for various reasons) and they are muting because they want to limit how advantage they lose by streaming (so other guilds can't gather as much intel)
[2022-12-19 14:41:27] <%+bucco> missed progress, hows this fight so far is it insane?

[2022-12-19 15:18:36] <Welsy_> @Didrinator tbh the main issue I see with it is the similar animation between pushback and frontal, so hard to distinguish, you really have to look at timer/weak aura

[2022-12-19 15:22:48] <Laawwx> HOW MANY PULLS?
[2022-12-19 15:22:48] <%Didrinator> @FozzyTV having a norwegian is automatic +20% dps, totally not biased Kappa
[2022-12-19 15:22:49] <%+FozzyTV> I hope Blizz won’t change the encounter on NA daylight time - this would be an absolute bummer
[2022-12-19 15:22:53] <Nistegord> @awalin @Welsy_ depending on what the variables are you also can use things like shape, or size to plot the second variable. for example if your second variable is discrete you can use shape
[2022-12-19 15:22:57] <+Emperor_Selch> why not go 6 healers and push for more mechanics even if they dont meet enrage timer?
[2022-12-19 15:23:02] <jameson1337> @zeede1 its just a meme because DH is a very basic class get over it, thats facts
[2022-12-19 15:23:09] <FankieQT> @Laawwx look at screen

[2022-12-19 15:23:21] <Laawwx> @Laawwx ok ty
[2022-12-19 15:23:21] <Welsy_> @awalin functions of 2 variables have graphs in 3D space and generally plotting them just by hand is unwise
[2022-12-19 15:23:31] <+sckkkk> !pull
[2022-12-19 15:23:37] <+Emperor_Selch> some of those mechanics hit really hard

[2022-12-19 15:23:50] <+aocAorus> @Emperor_Selch People getting one/- two shotted by mechanics. Cant outheal it
[2022-12-19 15:23:52] <%+FozzyTV> @didrinator - agree and people from Finland (Paragon remembering)
[2022-12-19 15:23:53] <Casualdps> This is last boss?
[2022-12-19 15:23:58] <Mysteel> @Emperor_Selch it's still not a lack of healing problem, at all
[2022-12-19 15:24:01] <Welsy_> ot_index clearly the ADVANCED class
[2022-12-19 15:24:10] <snorrow92> @Emperor_Selch more healers dont solve a one-shot mechanic or falling off the platform

[2022-12-19 15:25:55] <Draquzad> if it is possible to fly to another platform when she push u back 2-3 time there is static on other platform and dungeon journal say that slows u down and there is none on this one
[2022-12-19 15:25:58] <Welsy_> @thedrwingman movement speed increases, movement abilities, teleports, anything
[2022-12-19 15:25:59] <h4sanii> @Mysteel interesting, I just check method's stream, gives a good idea but will check raider  io

[2022-12-19 15:30:15] <yudai95> @Muddymonk ok so if warrior heroic leaps on other side of boss in middle of pushback, or u gateway behind her o nother side, u will get pushback over the other edge

[2022-12-19 15:50:19] <+jkahrb> @ot_index there is a huge difference between general strat and detailed movement/small adjustments, and those make the difference
[2022-12-19 15:50:35] <ShooTVeksdee> @ot_index It's hard to see exactly what's happening from 1 POV. But if it's being vocalized, it's damn easy to know
[2022-12-19 15:50:38] <Vivacjusz> I mean NA is obviously once again behind EU but reset may give them "that little notch" to win it

[2022-12-19 15:54:48] <VexorNavyIssue> They should make a famous character that we already know the final boss. Like Sylvanas!

[2022-12-19 17:03:30] <futoroxo> guys is it down before reset ? what you thinking ?
[2022-12-19 17:03:42] <+pepkern> @futoroxo don't think so
[2022-12-19 17:03:44] <trulton> @futoroxo No chance
[2022-12-19 17:03:59] <+margothon> no waythis goes down before reclear and vault loot
[2022-12-19 17:04:00] <futoroxo> some nerfs inc Kappa
[2022-12-19 17:04:02] <%+Slicedbacon> this wont even be the hardest phase of the fight probably
[2022-12-19 17:04:14] <+aviLio_uwu> the fight looks so hard
[2022-12-19 17:04:30] <+kingtoke1991> wait who is in the lead?
[2022-12-19 17:04:38] <+kingtoke1991> max or echo?
[2022-12-19 17:04:41] <%+Slicedbacon> echo
[2022-12-19 17:04:41] <+themaliciousrabbit> 45 pulls and not even out of phase one, would not want to be in these guys shoes right now lol
[2022-12-19 17:04:43] <+margothon> which unfortunatly gives liquid a day head start
[2022-12-19 17:04:43] <alcyone1985> yes
[2022-12-19 17:04:46] <+lixery> Did the boss transition om 70%?
[2022-12-19 17:04:54] <raeghon01> !best
[2022-12-19 17:04:59] <+Emperor_Selch> without nerf this wont be down before reset, also this tier feels like emerald nightmare because it will be completed first day after reset which gives advantage to N A guilds
[2022-12-19 17:05:13] <Deathwiller> boss dmg so big

[2022-12-19 17:05:34] <alcyone1985> sound on when?
[2022-12-19 17:05:38] <+gleepottz> emerald nightmare was completed day one
[2022-12-19 17:05:44] <lakers2324> WF chat thinking this boss falls after reset when we haven’t even seen most of the fight LUL
[2022-12-19 17:06:01] <%justkeepinreal> it will fall before xmas
[2022-12-19 17:06:03] <futoroxo> witch end boss was most pulls ?
[2022-12-19 17:06:04] <BuMatTV> Nothing.. again You are in the alliance.. is the problem..
[2022-12-19 17:06:07] <Hsbaernd> @lakers2324 yeah :D ppl going crazy
[2022-12-19 17:06:21] <%+FozzyTV> It could be a question of a gear upgrade or a nerf within the next 5 hours
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <+chunkyb0b> Does boss phase at 70%?
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <Anzi69> what happened to the sound?
[2022-12-19 17:06:40] <+Hellts1> @chunkyb0b 64.8%
[2022-12-19 17:07:13] <+margothon> i think they should nerf it when echo go to bed, what you think guys?

[2022-12-19 17:07:28] <+Emperor_Selch> would Echo be better positioned if they spent the next few hours doing m+ 19/20 if they have keys?

[2022-12-19 17:07:30] <%+FozzyTV> Imagine Blizzard hotfixing the boss in the next 6 to 8 hours. This would be in the sleeptime for echo
[2022-12-19 17:07:35] <futoroxo> they just need 15 arcane mage and its down
[2022-12-19 17:07:43] <%+FozzyTV> and it happened before
[2022-12-19 17:07:56] <+Emperor_Selch> only gear upgrade they can get is from m+ 19/20
[2022-12-19 17:08:18] <klenis> @FozzyTV that would be quite sad since then NA would wake up to new mythic gear and a nerfed last boss
[2022-12-19 17:08:18] <+aviLio_uwu> Dragonflight lore is basically fighting all primal incarnates one by one?
[2022-12-19 17:08:29] <+Moksha303> Hype
[2022-12-19 17:08:31] <%+Thoreya> why would they hotfix the boss
[2022-12-19 17:08:34] <%+Thoreya> lol
[2022-12-19 17:08:36] <+AtomicFrogHD> what is his inventory addon?
[2022-12-19 17:08:37] <+margothon> then the big guy last yes
[2022-12-19 17:08:41] <%+FozzyTV> US reset is tomorrow
[2022-12-19 17:08:45] <Kaaras97> @aviLio_uwu dont spoiler the ppl Kappa
[2022-12-19 17:08:48] <+Arniboy> do they have 3 tanks?
[2022-12-19 17:09:08] <+margothon> the daddy of all dragonkin last
[2022-12-19 17:09:24] <abilitytogoeven> no the spec icon is bugged on healing meter its a holy paladin
[2022-12-19 17:09:26] <%+FozzyTV> Because US chat was already whining about the boss not possible by maths @thoreya

[2022-12-19 17:09:45] <+hlghside> arcane looks so hard on this fight
[2022-12-19 17:09:53] <bearshy> chat is there any hint at who will be the final boss of the expansion? like the looming threat? is it resurrected galakrond or something?
[2022-12-19 17:09:55] <%justkeepinreal> arcane overall too hard
[2022-12-19 17:10:00] <+margothon> i think nozdormuu will be a last boss in the next
[2022-12-19 17:10:08] <futoroxo> thrall is coming riding with onyx to mash thise little dragons
[2022-12-19 17:10:20] <trulton> Final boss is Chromie
[2022-12-19 17:10:22] <%+Slicedbacon> they mentioned iridikron right, but i guess hes just the next raid?
[2022-12-19 17:10:23] <+hlghside> arcane plays like a FFXIV class.
[2022-12-19 17:10:25] <%+FozzyTV> Secret Boss or Secret Phase ?
[2022-12-19 17:10:25] <%justkeepinreal> no thrall pls in this exp
[2022-12-19 17:10:26] <BuMatTV> no vanish
[2022-12-19 17:10:26] <+Emperor_Selch> next expansion is Draenor planet, it will be the unexplored region of WOD and maybe they convert Draenor to Azeroth 3.0 and give it a full planet map
[2022-12-19 17:10:28] <lakers2324> Galakrond would be a cool end boss
[2022-12-19 17:10:29] <%+FozzyTV> Love it

[2022-12-19 17:10:35] <purrzoned> Personally, I find killing Nozdormu as the final boss is a good transition into a void expansion.
[2022-12-19 17:10:36] <dzreams> @bearshy it's going to be the jailers jailer, the super jailer, real warcraft boss since warcraft two
[2022-12-19 17:10:36] <+margothon> or murozond should i say
[2022-12-19 17:10:37] <%+Thoreya> @FozzyTV i mean some people here were saying the boss was too hard as well. idt theyre gonna nerf it when there both on it
[2022-12-19 17:10:42] <Awesome_DoDo> @Emperor_Selch you are hired!

[2022-12-19 17:11:23] <futoroxo> on secret phase
[2022-12-19 17:11:38] <%+FozzyTV> and I‘m always hoping for secret phases or super bad evil guy boss no 9 making an appearance
[2022-12-19 17:11:42] <+margothon> not just a different world, a different world in another timeline

[2022-12-19 17:12:05] <Dogbreath81> Damage is coming along nice with the 4 healing. If they can live, they should be able to push p2.
[2022-12-19 17:12:06] <+Emperor_Selch> it will start with nozdurmo getting corrupted and using time travel again to go back to Garrosh 3.0 in alternate Draenor
[2022-12-19 17:12:07] <tuplakingsize> void lords

[2022-12-19 17:17:23] <purrzoned> @FozzyTV I dont. I dont dislike dragonriding or anything but I prefer normal flying. If I want to stay suspended in air and pause flying I can do so. If I want to go higher I can without falling off.
[2022-12-19 17:17:42] <%+FozzyTV> ok valid point @purrzoned
[2022-12-19 17:17:47] <ubuhlungu> no midair afk is the best part of no normal flying in war mode

[2022-12-19 17:31:19] <bangorangg> @Thoreya and another thing to mention is mythic started on week 1 this tier. Meaning the guilds only had 1 week's of splits vs 2 which they normally have. They're killing the bosses quicker, and with less comparative ilvl than previous tiers. Its undertuned.

[2022-12-19 17:40:11] <%+nuurrrii> @bailey131983 bro stop being boring ffs
[2022-12-19 17:40:17] <+MixedVodka> you can either say it has 5 phases or 3 phases + 2 intermissions (in normal and heroic)
[2022-12-19 17:40:18] <+admiralsmit> Or some sylvanas stuff?
[2022-12-19 17:40:18] <Vivacjusz> @admiralsmit no, -10
[2022-12-19 17:40:21] <Jackster_Hakkinen> so only 2 phases right
[2022-12-19 17:40:22] <+FlumbyTV> I doubt it @admiralsmit

[2022-12-19 22:08:00] <Rytme> It feels insane compared to the other bosses this tier. The pull curve is out of proportion
[2022-12-19 22:08:31] <+retreatttv> @Rytme its an end boss? :) - And it sounds like you're on the boss aswell :)

[2022-12-19 23:43:42] <earthantm> range needs an aoe buff or dungeons need to tone down random mechanics on range
