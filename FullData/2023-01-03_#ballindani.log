[2023-01-03 11:02:04] <Keraunokani> we moved to Oregon when I was two
[2023-01-03 11:02:09] <Keraunokani> if that makes it better
[2023-01-03 11:02:23] <%emessar> Depends on where in Oregon
[2023-01-03 11:02:33] <Captainskylink> Gravity Falls, Oregon
[2023-01-03 11:02:33] <Keraunokani> Eugene and then Portland
[2023-01-03 11:02:38] <@%Kagetheorc5150> @Keraunokani It means you left before you were raised to believe North Carolina is the aviation birthplace
[2023-01-03 11:02:39] <811Alex> that worked better than expected LUL
[2023-01-03 11:02:43] <%emessar> Far eastern Oregon is uhh... definitely an experience

[2023-01-03 11:03:11] <%emessar> As someone who went to Oregon State, why would anyone want to live in Eugene somnus1Hehe

[2023-01-03 11:03:29] <Keraunokani> lots of weed?

[2023-01-03 11:43:11] <Captainskylink> The remedy to make Ball more exciting is to give him a Spiderman skin
