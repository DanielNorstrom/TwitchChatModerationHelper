[2022-12-24 13:18:50] <!%$GinGear> @Rennslyaer the paradox comes from the fact that you close the portal before the original probe can fly through (which is a limitation of game physics not being able to predict you closing the portal)
[2022-12-24 13:19:04] <!%$GinGear> if the original you manages to get into the black hole, it's not a paradox
[2022-12-24 13:19:24] <!%$GinGear> you just can't do something to prevent you from time travelling
