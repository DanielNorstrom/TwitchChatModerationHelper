[2022-12-07 16:31:39] <!%AirahsELL> some actual tips the game doesn't tell you: scrap is used as money at space stations for parts and repairs and for ship upgrades in the pause menu. if you see a blue option in an event window, pick it since its usually the best option based on the equipment you have on hand.
[2022-12-07 16:31:42] <ArrrrWastaken> Pro Tip: Use the pause function liberally
[2022-12-07 16:31:50] <%Sotetsu> Is Ken a stay at home dad?
[2022-12-07 16:31:54] <%madmat_pb_13> space can't be as scary as being underwater right?

[2022-12-07 16:32:02] <$StrikingWalrus> dont forget to use space to pause

[2022-12-07 16:32:22] <Temporal_Paradox> scrap is money AND used to upgrade the ship like skill points
[2022-12-07 16:32:26] <%RedOniVA> @madmat_pb_13 We're more likely to be underwater than off of the Earth in space, so... I'd be more scared of the deep ocean.

[2022-12-07 16:32:56] <!%AirahsELL> use your hotkeys. 1 through 4 are to turn on your weapons and space is to pause so you can issue orders or aim weapons.

[2022-12-07 16:54:27] <!%AirahsELL> ok so the space spiders event is one of the worst in the game. unless you have a very specific weapon to kill living things (i think its called a bio beam) you have an 80% chance of losing a crew member no matter what.

[2022-12-07 17:00:10] <Komfigaming> buy that fuel
[2022-12-07 17:00:15] <%RabidBeefalo> You might be better off selling the free weapon you got, it would take a lot of scrap to power it + missles

[2022-12-07 17:41:42] <Kronksterpher> it gives 1 free power
[2022-12-07 17:41:44] <%ArkOfTurus> You'd have to upgrade weapons.

[2022-12-07 17:41:56] <!%AirahsELL> the Zoltan is 1 power so long as hes working the weapons

[2022-12-07 18:34:07] <Kronksterpher> and you usually get shields in bursts of 2

[2022-12-07 18:38:26] <%RabidBeefalo> the thing you just bought was extra power, you need to upgrade your shield to hold more power

[2022-12-07 19:16:56] <JoesGuy> Also dodging
[2022-12-07 19:16:56] <!%AirahsELL> engines are better dodge i think too
[2022-12-07 19:17:00] <Kronksterpher> it increases your dodge rate
[2022-12-07 19:17:00] <GuyMcGuy> engines also means more evasion

[2022-12-07 19:25:30] <!%AirahsELL> you need to use both lasers at once because 3 shields

[2022-12-07 19:39:09] <nyjoe41> what a great run you have there olivia
[2022-12-07 19:39:10] VIEWERS: 426
[2022-12-07 19:39:11] <Sleeper_can> The hull breach caused oxygen leaks.
[2022-12-07 19:39:11] <%IgnorantOrc> Hull breaches will instantly drain a room but will leech air from other rooms slowly
[2022-12-07 19:39:15] <Sarcastically_Logical> Basically the crew needed to be healed in the medbay, then brought to the rooms to fix the room.
[2022-12-07 19:39:18] <%Megaket> It was good advice for the sake of repairing the hull breaches, but it would have required effort put into repairing said hull breaches LUL
[2022-12-07 19:39:20] <%+Sinhammer6> oxygen will equalize between the rooms with doors open
[2022-12-07 19:39:20] <Womperschnitzel> hull breach empties that room of oxygen. doors contain the leak into just the room with the breach
[2022-12-07 19:39:22] <Komfigaming> you did great
[2022-12-07 19:39:23] <%+Enygmus> second try
[2022-12-07 19:39:23] <gary_man_man> oxygen between rooms evens out if the doors between them are open
[2022-12-07 19:39:30] <Kronksterpher> if you open a door it shares the oxygen with the room thats empty so you can repair the hull
[2022-12-07 19:39:35] <+namons> that was not slowly
[2022-12-07 19:39:36] <+GloriousLotus> if you open nearby rooms with oxygen, it will slow the oxygen depletion from the breach
[2022-12-07 19:39:38] <Komfigaming> who did open the doors?!?
[2022-12-07 19:39:38] <ViciAvaritia> Missioned failed we'll get em next time
[2022-12-07 19:39:42] <JoesGuy> Death was certain
[2022-12-07 19:39:42] <Komfigaming> said*
[2022-12-07 19:39:44] <GuyMcGuy> but when in doubt on breaches when you are not in a fight.... send someone to repair but walk them out to heal before they die
[2022-12-07 19:39:51] <Sarcastically_Logical> I honestly don't know why anyone wanted you to open the doors. There was no reason too.
[2022-12-07 19:39:51] <Womperschnitzel> opening the doors leached oxygen from other rooms quickly
[2022-12-07 19:39:51] <wallchicken> "you guys," 1 guy tho
[2022-12-07 19:39:51] <Temporal_Paradox> opening doors mixes some new air in, but also uses it up. its a trade off for a little bit of time for repair
[2022-12-07 19:39:52] <Kronksterpher> after you open the doors you need to repair the hull quickly
[2022-12-07 19:39:55] <GuyMcGuy> just repair in like 4 tries
[2022-12-07 19:39:57] <Kronksterpher> and only the internal doorsz
[2022-12-07 19:39:58] <Komfigaming> should have left all doors closed
[2022-12-07 19:40:03] <+namons> no they're thinking the oxygen generator can keep up enough to let you fix the hole.... but yeah
[2022-12-07 19:40:05] <Temporal_Paradox> inside doors, not outside
[2022-12-07 19:40:08] <%Hentaiwatcher_> imagine air is liquid,   if you have a room with O2,  and open a door without it,  the air flows into the other rooms
[2022-12-07 19:40:13] <%Megaket> Exactly
[2022-12-07 19:40:16] <+namons> but you can literally cycle people out
[2022-12-07 19:40:23] <SoulCorky> Just going in repair a bit and go back to medbay would be safer tho.
[2022-12-07 19:40:24] <Kronksterpher> yeah
[2022-12-07 19:40:26] <wallchicken> buys no time if there's a breach unless you got lvl 3 O2
[2022-12-07 19:40:27] <%IgnorantOrc> 1 extra point in o2 is cheap and often worth
[2022-12-07 19:40:32] <%imdizzyandsalty> Grandmaaaa olivia50Love olivia50Love olivia50Love
[2022-12-07 19:40:32] <+namons> that's the better, if slower, tactic
[2022-12-07 19:40:33] <Temporal_Paradox> You did great
[2022-12-07 19:40:35] <JoesGuy> One upgrade for doors and oxygen are a good idea
[2022-12-07 19:40:36] <GuyMcGuy> the "open the doors" kind ruins it when you open to a breach afaik :)
[2022-12-07 19:40:36] <!%AirahsELL> it works like how it would work in real life. please dont tell me we have to explain vacuums to you too oli
[2022-12-07 19:40:39] <%$knightofcups777> can you be a species that doesn't need o2 ? LYUL
[2022-12-07 19:40:44] <+GloriousLotus> as you progress through sectors you want to level up almost all systems once
[2022-12-07 19:40:44] <%Megaket> I believe with the oxygen systems maxed, you refill air into the room faster than it drains
[2022-12-07 19:40:48] <M0rdecai_QC> You don't need to level Oxygen, just bounce people between the hull breach and the medbay.

[2022-12-07 19:41:54] <nyjoe41> big warm olivia hugs
[2022-12-07 19:41:54] <CanofUniGear> leveling oxygen is luxury, i recommend not to, unless you play on easy or normal
[2022-12-07 19:41:58] <JoesGuy> It was a great first run, though
[2022-12-07 19:42:01] <+GloriousLotus> put someone there or upgrade them relatively early
[2022-12-07 19:42:09] <GuyMcGuy> and yeah, upping the medbay and oxygen by 1 means you can put turbo on them between battles
[2022-12-07 19:42:13] <Kronksterpher> @CanofUniGear ^
[2022-12-07 19:42:21] <+GloriousLotus> there's 1 exception where you want to level oxygen but I don't want to spoil it
[2022-12-07 19:42:23] <wallchicken> lvl2 O2 is peanuts
[2022-12-07 19:42:27] <nyjoe41> lucky you didn't play this game on hard mode olivia
[2022-12-07 19:42:34] <steelgolem9> imagine your meeples having enough oxygen and being comfortable
[2022-12-07 19:42:35] <steelgolem9> the dream
[2022-12-07 19:42:38] <!%AirahsELL> its cheap
[2022-12-07 19:42:48] <MrHolmer420> play it in tutorial mode HypeSleep
[2022-12-07 19:42:49] <Kronksterpher> the game isnt balanced for hard mode
[2022-12-07 19:42:50] <Womperschnitzel> I usually upgrade O2 and medbay if I'm really lucky and swimming in scrap
[2022-12-07 19:42:50] <!%AirahsELL> like only 20 scrap
[2022-12-07 19:42:50] <+GloriousLotus> (hint : slug)
[2022-12-07 19:42:51] <GuyMcGuy> its like 20 and 20 for lvl 2 oxy and med i think?
[2022-12-07 19:42:51] <JoesGuy> Hard mode is the real grind
[2022-12-07 19:42:56] <Sarcastically_Logical> FTL is a very management game, yea. The fact you are commonly pausing alot is a very good thing
[2022-12-07 19:43:04] <Kronksterpher> its balanced for normal
[2022-12-07 19:43:05] <Komfigaming> you can ignore holes in outer rooms like that
[2022-12-07 19:43:07] <wallchicken> in a good way, it's a negligible expense
[2022-12-07 19:43:09] <Sleeper_can> One more run?
[2022-12-07 19:43:10] VIEWERS: 409
[2022-12-07 19:43:14] <Kronksterpher> easy isnt easy
[2022-12-07 19:43:25] <+GloriousLotus> In theory, you should be able to win almost all games on normal on most ships. It's like Slay the Spire. Knowledge win the game
[2022-12-07 19:43:26] <CanofUniGear> scrap goes for sheild+weapons, then a bit for engines, simple as
[2022-12-07 19:43:31] <+GloriousLotus> don't know about hard
[2022-12-07 19:43:37] <JoesGuy> Pausing is good, but hard mode improves enemy ships weapons and shields earlier on and lowers scrap rewards.
[2022-12-07 19:43:40] <nyjoe41> i always play any game on easy mode all the time for myself
[2022-12-07 19:43:41] <Sarcastically_Logical> Hard is quite literally you are in a deficit
[2022-12-07 19:43:44] <Kronksterpher> normal is tough but fair
[2022-12-07 19:43:44] <+GloriousLotus> Disagreed about "a bit for engine"
[2022-12-07 19:43:45] <Kronksterpher> normal
[2022-12-07 19:43:50] <Womperschnitzel> Normal
[2022-12-07 19:43:52] <+GloriousLotus> Engines against the boss really help
[2022-12-07 19:43:54] <gary_man_man> only beat on easy
[2022-12-07 19:43:57] <fylkzahdeyax> a single missile hit can wreck your run even on easy
[2022-12-07 19:43:58] <Kronksterpher> pausing becomes important to micromange
[2022-12-07 19:44:05] <Sarcastically_Logical> I've beat the game with everything on Hard but a few ships.
[2022-12-07 19:44:12] <Sarcastically_Logical> You really got to get lucky with hard
[2022-12-07 19:44:17] <Kronksterpher> oh and some sectors
[2022-12-07 19:44:21] <Kronksterpher> are better for different ships
[2022-12-07 19:44:33] <!%AirahsELL> also some ships have very different strategies. mantis ships for example are all about boarding parties and give you strong fighters to start
[2022-12-07 19:44:33] <wallchicken> Another thing is you don't have to max power every system. Lvl2 means O2 can take a hit without shutting down. You can power it when you really need it.
[2022-12-07 19:44:35] <%kirby23590> limesSmug
[2022-12-07 19:44:42] <deadbeat444> There's a lot of randomness in there, yeah
[2022-12-07 19:44:43] <nox_nyctores> That's Xcom baby
[2022-12-07 19:44:43] <+Fuzzymix> exactly
[2022-12-07 19:44:44] <Kronksterpher> so sometimes going to a hostile sector can be better than the easier if you strong against it
[2022-12-07 19:44:46] <Womperschnitzel> there's a lot of RNG involved, yes
[2022-12-07 19:44:52] <Komfigaming> was a great first attempt, you did great while trying to learn
[2022-12-07 19:44:56] <Kronksterpher> yeah you can also upgrade it so it just doesnt break
[2022-12-07 19:44:57] <JoesGuy> YES
[2022-12-07 19:44:58] <nyjoe41> sure
[2022-12-07 19:44:58] <+GloriousLotus> Lvl2 O2 also means that if you take a hit you don't get hull damage, where as if your O2 gets red, you take hull damage
[2022-12-07 19:45:00] <%$Aiakos_VEVO> YES

[2022-12-07 19:50:52] <deadbeat444> Endless Space and Stellaris are fab
[2022-12-07 19:50:55] <sadoni> eu4 is best genocide sim
[2022-12-07 19:50:57] <GuyMcGuy> everything with Endless in the name is pretty decent
[2022-12-07 19:50:58] <%+Sinhammer6> outer wilds is a fun game too
[2022-12-07 19:51:00] <%+Abstract_Endurance> Endless Space 2 is amazing
[2022-12-07 19:51:00] <mango__7> I've never tried it but spore looks fun

[2022-12-07 19:51:11] VIEWERS: 418
[2022-12-07 19:51:15] <gary_man_man> outer wilds for sure

[2022-12-07 19:51:32] <%BonusLizard> but from that list, X-com
[2022-12-07 19:51:33] <GuyMcGuy> i mean, the studio that made Endless Space, also made Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless, Endless Dungeon LUL
[2022-12-07 19:51:34] <@%owlishnick> Would you like a poll?
[2022-12-07 19:51:34] <%+Abstract_Endurance> XCOM
[2022-12-07 19:51:34] <JoesGuy> FTL... oh, Crusader Kings I guess

[2022-12-07 19:51:42] <%Hentaiwatcher_> rimworld!
[2022-12-07 19:51:43] <ViciAvaritia> Xcom
[2022-12-07 19:51:44] <%$SaintanickClause> bannerlord! could be cool but xcom is solid!
[2022-12-07 19:51:45] <%+Sinhammer6> rimworld and any diablo
[2022-12-07 19:51:46] <Komfigaming> outer wilds would be a great youtube game for you to play
[2022-12-07 19:51:47] <Sarcastically_Logical> honestly Xcom (Suggest Enemy Unkown with the DLC Enemy Within)
[2022-12-07 19:51:47] <%GinTamashiVT> XCom!
[2022-12-07 19:51:49] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Diablo
[2022-12-07 19:51:49] <%$Aiakos_VEVO> yeah xcom will be really funny
[2022-12-07 19:51:50] <M0rdecai_QC> XCOM
[2022-12-07 19:51:50] <%Sotetsu> XCOM or rimworld
[2022-12-07 19:51:54] <baccon13> path of exile xD
[2022-12-07 19:51:54] <nyjoe41> alot of XCOM
[2022-12-07 19:51:54] <flufflepimp> Black and White 2
[2022-12-07 19:51:59] <JoesGuy> Oli be poppin' alien heads
[2022-12-07 19:52:02] <%$SaintanickClause> yeah it is a GAME olivia50Cheer
[2022-12-07 19:52:04] <$balrabbus> X-COM
[2022-12-07 19:52:06] <ViciAvaritia> Xcom 2
[2022-12-07 19:52:09] <wallchicken> Finds FTL complex; gets recommended 4X and GSG. Jebaited
[2022-12-07 19:52:11] <JoesGuy> Yum
[2022-12-07 19:52:15] <%TalkingObject> X-com enemy within
[2022-12-07 19:52:15] <+Aegelward> X-com allows for a lot of customisation too
[2022-12-07 19:52:17] <Volgivagus> Diablo 2 is sick
[2022-12-07 19:52:18] <%GinTamashiVT> Xcom can take quite a while to beat though. Not a short game unless you lose
[2022-12-07 19:52:20] <Sarcastically_Logical> @wallchicken shhhhhh
[2022-12-07 19:52:21] <@%owlishnick> XCOM is great if you like to miss on 98% odds
[2022-12-07 19:52:22] <%ArcReaper_21> X-Com is fun too
[2022-12-07 19:52:30] <%Hentaiwatcher_> what are you most looking forward to trying oli?
[2022-12-07 19:52:33] <Komfigaming> xcom 2
[2022-12-07 19:52:38] <@%DrGoodStrats> moistLUL
[2022-12-07 19:52:41] <%+Sinhammer6> rimworld will prepare your mind for dwarf fortress
[2022-12-07 19:52:41] <%+Abstract_Endurance> Dwarf Fortress is very complex
[2022-12-07 19:52:45] <%olemars> have to work your way up to dwarf fortress
[2022-12-07 19:52:46] <%$SaintanickClause> KappaClaus
[2022-12-07 19:52:48] <%+Carkistador> a lot is an understatement
[2022-12-07 19:52:51] <Sarcastically_Logical> FTL is a great game to play while you are waiting on other things and such
[2022-12-07 19:52:51] <SoulCorky> Can't wait to see Olivia rage at three '95% hit' fail in a row.
[2022-12-07 19:52:53] <Temporal_Paradox> If you like rimworld and it doesn't overwhelm you too much then try Dwarf Fortress
[2022-12-07 19:52:53] <fantasticbovine> dwarf fortress does not pull any punches
[2022-12-07 19:52:55] <%IgnorantOrc> yeah probably play Rimworld before Dwarf Fortress LuL
[2022-12-07 19:52:58] <%+Abstract_Endurance> Rimworld is Dwarf Fortress lite
[2022-12-07 19:53:01] <JoesGuy> I can't wait to see how many kingdoms Oli destroys with her infinite rage.
[2022-12-07 19:53:04] <%ArcReaper_21> There's also that new Marvel game from the X-Com devs.
[2022-12-07 19:53:06] <%Lillowh> Is dwarf fortress your white whale?

[2022-12-07 19:53:22] <%Hentaiwatcher_> LUL
[2022-12-07 19:53:26] <%GinTamashiVT> It's simple, but it seems fun!
[2022-12-07 19:53:27] <@%owlishnick> Your brothers treat it like a collectathon you have to collect 30 pieces of the excel spreadsheet to unlock the DF door
[2022-12-07 19:53:28] <%+Sinhammer6> i mean... rimworld isnt a looker either...
[2022-12-07 19:53:33] <Komfigaming> rimworld will train you for dwarf fortress
[2022-12-07 19:53:37] <JoesGuy> FTL looks lovely. I'm taking her to prom.
[2022-12-07 19:53:41] <SoulCorky> Olivia is as cute as FTL.
[2022-12-07 19:53:52] <%Sotetsu> Excel sheets? So we're playing Eve Online?
[2022-12-07 19:53:52] <!%Fuzzgotgames> How was the experience of FTL? What you expected?
[2022-12-07 19:53:55] <Sarcastically_Logical> I have unironically bought ftl 10-ish times now
[2022-12-07 19:53:58] <%GinTamashiVT> NotLikeThis
[2022-12-07 19:53:59] <%olemars> XCOM teaches you a lot about statistics and probabilities and that most of them are lies
[2022-12-07 19:54:00] <%CorvusDelta> Oli is such a LOOKER
[2022-12-07 19:54:04] <%+Abstract_Endurance> you should see the ASCII graphics for Dwarf Fortress, thats a REAL spreadsheet
[2022-12-07 19:54:05] <Sarcastically_Logical> Gifted it to firends
[2022-12-07 19:54:06] <SoulCorky> peepoShy FTL
[2022-12-07 19:54:11] <%$SaintanickClause> But no that is a great way to work up to more challenging games because each one can introduce different mechanics at a time
[2022-12-07 19:54:15] <wallchicken> Didn't know Excel could be such a looker POGGERS
[2022-12-07 19:54:19] <%$SaintanickClause> wheras more difficult games have many mechanics
[2022-12-07 19:54:20] <fantasticbovine> FTL would be prom queen
[2022-12-07 19:54:23] <nyjoe41> maybe pink will be a great color for your ship olivia
[2022-12-07 19:54:23] <@%owlishnick> You had Ken what more could you want
[2022-12-07 19:54:25] <blitheVT> Olivia got the fastest fingers

[2022-12-07 19:54:56] <Komfigaming> you can tho
[2022-12-07 19:55:00] <Sarcastically_Logical> An old joke for FTL was that the doors where the strongest thing in the game.
[2022-12-07 19:55:01] <!%Fuzzgotgames> !so BlitheVT
