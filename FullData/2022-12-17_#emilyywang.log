[2022-12-17 00:12:38] <azheng25> but yeah 3 star 4 costs feel pretty underwhelming this set
[2022-12-17 00:12:38] <+nm_titanium> imagine if emily ends first after mods already paid the bet that she's not. lol
[2022-12-17 00:12:42] <%+Dope_R35> For real
[2022-12-17 00:12:44] <+drkwhitewolf> 8, 8 freaking seconds, plus 1 from augment. THAT'S 9 SECONDS!

[2022-12-17 00:12:49] <McEggface> its an augment
[2022-12-17 00:12:50] <%+Jarno_95> no because of hero augments
[2022-12-17 00:12:51] <d2gm> wrong augment kekw
[2022-12-17 00:12:53] <%+mncurtis27> if she was a 5 cost sure, but this is like 3 star hec from last set

[2022-12-17 00:12:53] <%Thug_Walrus> I went 5th with Sej 3 because her ult kept missing the carries Shruge
[2022-12-17 00:12:54] <+nm_titanium> @emilyywang if it did that it would be broken

[2022-12-17 00:13:04] <NeysaAlterEgo> does it not increase size at 3?
[2022-12-17 00:13:06] <%octopusoctopusoctopus> i mean they gatekept it in an augment Shruge

[2022-12-17 00:13:23] <McEggface> having 3 star do same as augment would be wierd

[2022-12-17 00:15:49] <+drkwhitewolf> @emilyywang  compared to old 4 cost sej and old 4 cost cho, the 3 star on this sej feels lack luster except for duration. I remember with cho you would switch him to full AP and watch everything die because he went to 2K base damage
