[2022-12-20 16:22:59] <+SpeedraZer> stocky, historically the S&P 500 has been the play for a reliable decent return, what index do you think easily beats it in the short term until the market stabilizes over the next 18 months? @TheStockGuy
[2022-12-20 16:23:01] <+MrScrewtape> As someone who works with cloud hosting, just the storage of prior streams at the quality of the stream will be costing them 10s of millions a month easy. Twitch is operating on stupid small margins.

[2022-12-20 18:01:51] <octacoon> i think there is more money to push homeless people away rather than help them
