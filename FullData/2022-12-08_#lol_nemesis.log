[2022-12-08 15:16:55] <mrimpressive7> @mikro45l bro my point is that a darius player or an irelia can kill with negative score very easily and make it diffivult even to 1v2 a zed with negative score will be difficult to do it
[2022-12-08 15:16:58] <mystergamer7> @talonkekw for items, it's on game you can any build tank or everfrost into tank

[2022-12-08 15:22:25] <uwumage> what if yuumi ceased to exist
[2022-12-08 15:22:27] <+96iris> I think just nerf her overall abilities by a flat % and add that % back on hopping onto an ally for a few secs
[2022-12-08 15:22:27] <+Spyran> What if we made Yuumi a book and she rides a cat?

[2022-12-08 15:22:48] <alicethealien27> should make her fly around like a sol stars and remove all her spells and if she hits someone she does dmg
[2022-12-08 15:22:48] <YesDukes> what if yuumi would be vegan?
[2022-12-08 15:22:50] <%+fruwut> what if we replaced yuumi with spiderman?
[2022-12-08 15:22:57] <prunejuice7> @Spyran ooh and the ally has to be literate for her to attach

[2022-12-08 17:03:21] <tamosiokas> Active: Jax enters Evasion, a defensive stance, for 2 seconds, causing all non- Ôøº turret basic attacks against him to be dodged. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all champion area of effectabilities. Counter Strike can be recast after 1 second. At the end of the duration, Jax Ôøº stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them, increased by 20% for each attack dodged, up to a 100% increase.

[2022-12-08 20:00:53] <+CarryMyCross> the only reason his WR is so low in low elo is becuase those players feed in laning phase by misusing his ult

[2022-12-08 20:01:07] <fuutuuuree> Riot releases new champ. It is overtuned. High elo players have great winrate. Piss low players do shit bc they are shit. Riot buffs champ already overtuned because low elo players havent figured it out yet. High elo is ruined. Every new champ this happens

[2022-12-08 22:58:31] <@^Nightbot> wait people are still here? lol thats really weird. i was just gunna click on a vod to watch cuz a friend recommended it and saw you guys still sitting here when the streamer isnt even live. Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of being friends with a streamer, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic. later Libido
