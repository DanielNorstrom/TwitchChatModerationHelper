[2023-01-05 16:03:30] <CryoGnuin> They might be getting rid of the streamer building
[2023-01-05 16:03:33] <catchmyhoove> I think Olympus my favorite of all time
[2023-01-05 16:03:52] <tougghh> do you have every heirloom?
[2023-01-05 16:03:59] <+Durandal_1707__> I've wanted to like Broken Moon but I just can't get into it.  From those garbage closing rings that trap you to all the POIs looking the same, it's probably my least favorite map.

[2023-01-05 18:51:39] <serendiggiity> hmm thats a good point nikki and e_tik140 yea ive noticed that too esp when i compare my first split stats
[2023-01-05 18:51:43] <@%Nataly> hi kev omfgnaHug
[2023-01-05 18:51:54] <%+e_tik140> @foulharpy RNG is what made learning the game hard. You‚Äôre only good with one or two weapons when you first start playing so you‚Äôre terrible off drop with random guns you don‚Äôt like
[2023-01-05 18:51:54] <%FoulHarpy> my KDR went up a lot when i switched to PC from console, having more than 30 frames during fights is a game changer
[2023-01-05 18:51:55] <@%Nataly> ive known you a lot longer tho LOL
[2023-01-05 18:52:00] <@%Nataly> i just rolled out of bed
[2023-01-05 18:52:32] <%+jammerz777> Thank you for saying that Nikki! That makes me feel better about my gameplay babyniLOVE try not to be so hard on ourselves!
[2023-01-05 18:52:44] <+„Å®„Å™„Çä„ÅÆ„Åµ„Å™ (ntrd27gogo)> Which do you prefer, Mastiff or Peaky?

[2023-01-05 18:53:09] <%FoulHarpy> i have a meeting i hate it here brb
[2023-01-05 18:53:22] <@%Kevachino> only an hour nat?
[2023-01-05 18:53:25] <@%Kevachino> rookie numbers
[2023-01-05 18:53:30] <%+e_tik140> Also think about time in the game. Nikki has like 4.5k hours in the game, most folks with a non-streaming day job can‚Äôt really touch those hours.
[2023-01-05 18:53:39] <%+e_tik140> So improvement comes slower
[2023-01-05 18:53:45] <%leaaf3> current job is slow so technically i‚Äôm being paid to watch nikki by the company
[2023-01-05 18:53:50] <@%Nataly> i slept for like 6 hours. im so tired man
[2023-01-05 18:54:05] <%+jammerz777> @e_tik140 also a very good point
[2023-01-05 18:54:11] <%brewssssss> I retract my previous statement then LOL
[2023-01-05 18:54:18] <serendiggiity> lifeline thought they were a revenant LOL
[2023-01-05 18:54:20] <@%Kevachino> how are you tired after 6 hours of sleep nat
[2023-01-05 18:54:21] <@%Kevachino> what
[2023-01-05 18:54:22] <serendiggiity> what was that strafe
[2023-01-05 18:54:34] <boomkungpao> That lifeline came outta nowhere üòÇ
[2023-01-05 18:54:34] <%+e_tik140> I thought that LL was knocked cuz they were crouching and barely moving lol
[2023-01-05 18:54:50] <@%+m4np0n> i dont care what anyone says.. iron sight on the car is GARBAGE
[2023-01-05 18:54:50] <serendiggiity> the perma crouch is a wild strat
