[2022-12-28 12:37:09] <%BishopBruce> Violent tendencies come from stoopid people.
[2022-12-28 12:37:12] <%TheLastTriceratops> Violent tendencies come from WATCHING YOU negnasYou telling us that you want to be punched in the face
[2022-12-28 12:37:13] <%carlosboom22> And Ash and Goku have sooo much in common
[2022-12-28 12:37:20] <StarryEyedEss> negnasu seems to be having violent tendencies
[2022-12-28 12:37:25] <gold_draws> the last time i felt that was 5 hours ago
[2022-12-28 12:37:30] <%Gowlthere> This sounds like a foretelling of what may be

[2022-12-28 12:38:07] <StarryEyedEss> most of the time it does
[2022-12-28 12:38:09] <Jazzyjammy> I believe those are just called intrusive thoughts

[2022-12-28 12:38:58] <%$HappyJalapeno> Is that why Neg wants us to punch her. Because she thinks that's what you do with cute things?

[2022-12-28 13:00:21] <%$thewizardchan> I never really feel that because all my friends I meet on a schedule. I see them at work, I see them at rehearsals etc.

[2022-12-28 13:00:39] <%Gowlthere> Indeed~ one of the hardest tasks one can have as well, is to be able to be by yourself, but not lonely. It is then you realize you are in the presence of good company, you know

[2022-12-28 13:01:18] <Highnobi> SO true! And when I make plans with friends I always want to stay home instead. Until I get there and find out it's actually fun
[2022-12-28 13:01:33] <%BishopBruce> You have no responsibility to us.
[2022-12-28 13:01:52] <BurgeoningOtter> Years ago, I couldn't get a grasp of those feelings but I started writing. I got published a couple times and people reached out telling me about their feelings and it helped me a lot
[2022-12-28 13:01:55] <%TheLastTriceratops> not really, I just need time on my own to think about things without being distracted by other people. And when I have stuff to think about, I want to be alone so I don't get distracted from my thought. But then if I spend too long on my own I get lonely.

[2022-12-28 13:15:13] <%krymz0nstreams> I'm more described as an introvert, but as a result of my family owning a service based business, I learned how to pretend to be an extrovert
[2022-12-28 13:15:19] <@%rexodiak> this might sound selfish but I can only approach a group when I feel like they're already gonna like me or they're willing to give me a chance, otherwise I shy away from crowds, I feel like the people in those and me aren't compatible

[2022-12-28 13:31:44] <imGHTmn> what if i don't know if people like being around me?
[2022-12-28 13:32:03] <%+king_mango95> I'm ok if people are fake as long as there sincere
[2022-12-28 13:32:12] <%TheLastTriceratops> @inquis_sv True. Often I say something and then immediately think "oof that's cringe" but in reality nobody notices. Also I always assumed the text in NNN day 21 was misspelt on purpose until the NNN retrospective stream where Neg said she was just high lol.
[2022-12-28 13:32:12] <%$HappyJalapeno> I wish I was capable of doing that

[2022-12-28 13:35:31] <@%pocopicopaully> you can't live in fear of betrayal, if you suspect it you confront I guess...
[2022-12-28 13:35:33] <%Nullamm> only if you GET betrayed, but if you do the betrayin' first....
[2022-12-28 13:35:44] <%Nullamm> then you have some control over how that goes
[2022-12-28 13:35:47] <Highnobi> I got the "You really have to learn when to shut up"... And honestly it still kind of hurt
[2022-12-28 13:35:53] <DMphobia> Did someone say betrayal?
[2022-12-28 13:35:54] <%$HappyJalapeno> I've been independently told by several people I am my own worst enemy so I believe it.
[2022-12-28 13:36:02] <AbyssiusConchoidal> So when do I get paid for this session, Neg?

[2022-12-28 13:37:36] <inquis_sv> tabletop sim is not super expensive, but the fact that it costs money is an oof for a lot of people
[2022-12-28 13:37:37] <%MossyGreySlope> That sounds like a really neat project.

[2022-12-28 13:37:55] <%Deleran> Board games are my second passion, right after digital games.
[2022-12-28 13:37:56] <Jazzyjammy> I remember having to make Board games for my game design course
[2022-12-28 13:38:04] <AbyssiusConchoidal> board games can really drag out certain, attributes.
[2022-12-28 13:38:06] <%Argomundo> One of my friends keeps stealing the same board game. He claims life is all about taking Risks
[2022-12-28 13:38:08] <%+soulwillin1997> my little brother got Mario Kart Monopoly for christmas
[2022-12-28 13:38:12] <DMphobia> The only board game I own is a copy of the Red Dragon Inn

[2022-12-28 13:38:34] <%Deleran> Board games tend to REQUIRE other people, though, whereas digital games encourage my loner lifestyle nicely.
[2022-12-28 13:38:41] <AbyssiusConchoidal> I've heard about that

But now when I do something cringe I just think "it happened, let's just move on." I don't know what changed, maybe it's just because I have more things to think about now and don't have enough time to cringe

[2022-12-28 14:16:01] <NewbieNewbz> monimuWow
[2022-12-28 14:16:12] <%TheLastTriceratops> When I was in primary school Year 1, my whole class basically turned me into the class scapegoat. They would muck around, and when the teacher found out they would always say that I did it. The teacher would always believe them and not me, so I got blamed and punished for everything. The teacher was also horrible, the older kids at the school bullied me, and the few friends that I had also bullied me. Luckily in Year 2 I went to a different school where I had a much better experience.

[2022-12-28 14:27:57] <@%rexodiak> you need some three ferapy
[2022-12-28 14:28:19] <%$RTSAvalanche> hate & anger is very useful
[2022-12-28 14:28:25] <%MossyGreySlope> Thinking about yourself is always more complicated than thinking about someone else.
[2022-12-28 14:28:34] <%CoachFate> Anger to yourself a lot more than others
[2022-12-28 14:28:43] <AbyssiusConchoidal> It's a "what happened to me" thing
[2022-12-28 14:28:48] <%TheLastTriceratops> Nobody knows you better than yourself. And sometimes even you don't know everything about yourself. But we are always learning
[2022-12-28 14:28:53] <DrongoDyle_VT> why do I imagine dapper neggpal screaming internally?
[2022-12-28 14:28:53] <@%rexodiak> explain it again
[2022-12-28 14:28:58] <@%Giygasinbattle> yeah i get it.
[2022-12-28 14:29:00] <%CoachFate> Yes I can’t take my own advice
[2022-12-28 14:29:07] VIEWERS: 140
[2022-12-28 14:29:23] <%CoachFate> It’s hard
[2022-12-28 14:29:30] <AbyssiusConchoidal> Advice is easy to regurgitate, hard to act on yourself.
[2022-12-28 14:29:44] <%Deleran> It absolutely makes sense, infuriatingly enough. The issue with offering advice is that you're bestowing advice onto someone, whereas the lessons people tend to internalize are the ones they experience personally, which oftentimes includes learning the hard way.
[2022-12-28 14:29:49] <$shadowmasters46> did anybody ever try think before your come to earth, did you guys have try to remember it where a you before birth into this world
[2022-12-28 14:30:29] <%krymz0nstreams> I gotta head to work, thanks for the ferapy Negs I'll catch you later
[2022-12-28 14:30:52] <DrongoDyle_VT> Its like marking essays. Noticing issues or things you'd improve on someone else's is super easy compared to improving your own
[2022-12-28 14:30:54] <%MossyGreySlope> I think so? You wouldn't accept the things you would want to tell her, because she didn't accept those things until you found out the hard way - which is why you want to tell her those things.
[2022-12-28 14:31:05] <%CoachFate> Therapy is far too expensive here

[2022-12-28 14:31:46] <AbyssiusConchoidal> So like... I guess I already understand that.
[2022-12-28 14:32:08] <%sleepydogzone> neg you know you're paying the dapper negpal 8k every 15 minutes for him to be here right.
[2022-12-28 14:32:32] <%Deleran> More general advice might be better for past selves, like "Look kid, life is fucking tough. It'll have plenty of ups and downs. All you can do is prepare yourself for how you handle the bumps, bwo." negZoomedWide
[2022-12-28 14:32:38] <AbyssiusConchoidal> Neg Gandi 2022: A picture a thousand words.. experience is more.
[2022-12-28 14:32:45] <%Highnobi> Acceptance is the gateway to a lot of positive things. Often the feeling of acceptance is close to the feeling of peace and clarity
[2022-12-28 14:32:56] <%+king_mango95> mines would be "follow your instincts more and take it, YES you can handle the heat, OH! and spare him and catch the ball you'll know when you know"
