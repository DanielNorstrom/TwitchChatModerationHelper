[2023-01-09 14:28:20] <%WiLDRAGE777> the only one that scales is the one that knocks out casts, imo.

[2023-01-09 14:28:25] <OntheChase> I don't mind sword for cast runs with Poseidon

[2023-01-09 16:04:14] <%$SlamNSalmon> @BarbarousKing the rental industry was created due to the super expensive price of VHS, not video games
[2023-01-09 16:04:16] <+g00fydrag0n> wasnt pokemon stadium like 95 dollars
[2023-01-09 16:04:16] <%neverhadfun1> Games have been costly but have not risen in price much overall. There is a weird scued look at em.
[2023-01-09 16:04:18] <%LordBuzzKillington> kids today don't know how good they got it
[2023-01-09 16:04:18] <%+breadwatcher> @BlickerBalls games are cheaper than ever

[2023-01-09 16:04:20] <$Ultrauberness> man blockbuster rental was 3 days, my parents wouldnt rent a game it was to expensive lol
[2023-01-09 16:04:21] <Awkwerp> gamestop would do a full refund on any game within 2 weeks no question so I had 2 weeks to beat my games as a kid LUL

[2023-01-09 16:04:38] <%+trickbuffer> @barbarousking parents rent games for their kids from the library now fo' free! lol
[2023-01-09 16:04:38] <%Clickums> rental industry let the quarter eater mentality from arcades bleed into consoles

[2023-01-09 16:04:54] <%+MentallyInept> it's people coming from mobile gaming where everything is fuckin' free

[2023-01-09 16:05:13] <%KOOLSM0KE> SMB3 as a kid i got down to 15 minutes of play time. Try that with your modern AAA game and no glitches LUL

[2023-01-09 16:24:32] <$FF3LockeZ> It was basically just raids but more complicated
[2023-01-09 16:24:37] <%+MoskittoTV> I see
[2023-01-09 16:24:37] <%midwestgamer69> rip
[2023-01-09 16:24:39] <%GarbageTown> Complex code to maintain without a lot of viewership or value-add proposition
[2023-01-09 16:24:40] <%+shameful_poo_death> Ok, that makes sense
[2023-01-09 16:24:42] <%Demagus3> i keep chatting but streamer is ignoring me! barbPanic
[2023-01-09 16:24:42] <%ShiraNoMai> I watched you on Trihex's channel for a whole month
[2023-01-09 16:24:45] <%hycutype> gives them control over discovery too
[2023-01-09 16:24:49] <%MobyDew> If I had a dime for every time I chatted in the wrong auto host chat, I’d have a few dollars
[2023-01-09 16:24:50] <%Cronny> that sucks
[2023-01-09 16:24:51] <%Randallooch> they want more money.
[2023-01-09 16:24:51] <$Spyderr> Oh okay that makes sense
[2023-01-09 16:24:51] <+lifeofpiein3d> shovel night run next on gdq barb
[2023-01-09 16:24:52] <%No0chvader> view counts only count if you refresh the page that you're watching when you raid
[2023-01-09 16:24:59] <%scarbo87> Weren't ppl also 'hosting' like MMA fights illegally and shit?
[2023-01-09 16:25:00] <%+OneWonderfulFish> They could very easily code to track that properly.
[2023-01-09 16:25:00] <%+solidpeyo> it would be better like a foward to that channel instead of keeping it in your channel
[2023-01-09 16:25:01] <%corignis> If they didn't suck at coding they could have their ad revenue and view count WITH hosting Sadge
[2023-01-09 16:25:04] <%SmoothNoob13> When does that take effect
[2023-01-09 16:25:05] <%MichaelFicarra> you could restream something like GDQ if you really wanted though, right?
[2023-01-09 16:25:09] <$FF3LockeZ> Raiding is almost the same thing
[2023-01-09 16:25:15] <%$beheld1> makes me sad a little bit
[2023-01-09 16:25:19] <%KOOLSM0KE> when they took away hosting they broke every other app other than pc. When I watch on tv I cannot get to the raiding stream.
[2023-01-09 16:25:23] <%+AtlasKazam> I'm glad raiding is still around at least
[2023-01-09 16:25:23] <%VashtaNerada195> i mean, they changed their primary monetization model to being average viewer based, so its super important to have those numbers accurate
[2023-01-09 16:25:23] <%Kentonftw> @scarbo87 People would show MMA while also having a controller in their hand acting like they were playing the MMA game lol
[2023-01-09 16:25:25] <%+jiffypawp> cut down on large hosts with bot chats too no?
[2023-01-09 16:25:28] <%Beeteebee> Hosting was kind of stupid
[2023-01-09 16:25:30] <%midwestgamer69> @corignis the poor devs

[2023-01-09 16:25:34] <zmeiler3> they took away hosting??!
[2023-01-09 16:25:40] <%+PatrickDoesABCs> that's why it doesn't work on Xbox anymore lol
[2023-01-09 16:25:45] <%Droooogie> he just said that
[2023-01-09 16:25:48] <BrandonBlank> neat
[2023-01-09 16:25:48] <%KOOLSM0KE> @PatrickDoesABCs correct
[2023-01-09 16:25:49] <$FF3LockeZ> Lots of people didn't understand hosting, they'd host a channel every night then go offline 10 seconds later so the host stopped
[2023-01-09 16:25:50] <+Jmhalder> @MichaelFicarra Generally no. You COULD, but that could easily get you in trouble if you don't have permission

[2023-01-09 16:26:04] <%No0chvader> right raiding hasn't changed, the only way for your view to count on twitch is if you refresh your page when you're in a chat
[2023-01-09 16:26:15] <%a_lemon> The xbox app was updated. it works on there

[2023-01-09 16:27:08] <%+meanman25> raiding doesn't work on the twitch app for firetv

[2023-01-09 16:27:32] <%$The5oClockShadow> I think my first playthrough was like 200 hours worth (partial skill issue LUL )
[2023-01-09 16:27:32] <%$zpianoman> how about you explore these nuts in your face
[2023-01-09 16:27:33] <%$wishfulthink3r> There is a certain level of feeling a little overwhelmed by how large the world is to explore
[2023-01-09 16:27:35] <%No0chvader> @GarbageTown if you raid, and you don't refresh the page that  you're taken to, the view does not count towards the streamer being raided
[2023-01-09 16:27:38] <TheGamerPandA> I’m haven’t played Elden ring yet but I liked the mega man style of exploring of demons

[2023-01-09 16:27:45] <%a_lemon> @KOOLSM0KE Yeah before I'm pretty sure it was just serving up a desktop reskin. But at least on the Series X it was updated to be a proper app

[2023-01-09 16:30:42] <%+uupop> Currently replaying Sekiro for like the sixth time and having just as much fun as the first
[2023-01-09 16:30:43] <%ParadoxTorque> Just in he middle of my first Sekiro playthrough
[2023-01-09 16:30:44] <%No0chvader> sekiro was my first from software game I ever played.  I had never felt more accomplished in my gaming life time
[2023-01-09 16:30:47] <%+MoskittoTV> Thats why From Software games are always top notch
[2023-01-09 16:30:47] <%Azur85> CRUNGERS
[2023-01-09 16:30:50] <%+Zaiz_En> I love Sekiro, Not a fan of Elden Ring

[2023-01-09 16:30:51] <TheGamerPandA> There’s really not many games capable of having that first play
[2023-01-09 16:30:53] <%Rocky210420> I just beat the second tree sentinel by The Castle I swear to God that bitch was killing me too much
[2023-01-09 16:30:54] <%Defective_Cheeto> I wish I would have played Sekiro before others. Just mashed my head against the parry mechanic for hours
[2023-01-09 16:30:58] <%+Lord_Suiadan> @kansascityshuffle00 That bitch took me 3 straight days before I finally figured her out
[2023-01-09 16:30:58] <%bertl> i am currently playing sekiro for the fisrst time after beating elden ring as my first from soft game. i miss the exploring :( but the combat is fking awesome

[2023-01-09 16:31:32] <Myrmiron> @Jovial_Works they have tho it just doesnt get showed down your throat
[2023-01-09 16:31:34] <%LightOfTheIronSausage> The opaque mechanics make from games kinda hard to access on a fisrt playthough - but I'm knitpicking
[2023-01-09 16:31:35] <+Bat_Boss> The first time the snake attacks you in Sekiro is so cool
[2023-01-09 16:31:41] <%corignis> Ooooh, knowing that about the level makes this much more interesting to watch

[2023-01-09 16:32:13] <%+MoskittoTV> @Jovial_Works Sekiro has one straight forward kinda, not Souls tho, you would have to dig on item descriptions and shit but very interesting anyway, see a video summing it up can be very satisfying too

[2023-01-09 16:32:34] <%DregBasher> for sure
[2023-01-09 16:32:35] <jeffrich> Morning Barb and chat!
[2023-01-09 16:32:38] <%SolveForX_> Sekiro is by far my favorite from soft game and the boss mods are insanely cool

[2023-01-09 16:32:41] <%+Diagnoosi86> barbLore
[2023-01-09 16:32:42] <+based_polski> Sekiro was amazing, just wasn't a fan of the lack of customization. It'd be cool if there were different Katanas and what not
[2023-01-09 16:32:44] <%$souleater98> Agree
[2023-01-09 16:32:45] <CynicalMonkey99> so many games have a metrovania  approach that makes you go "i can't get to this area but want to so i guess i have to go look for an item..." Elden Ring was great for being closer to "i can't get to this area , better work out how"
[2023-01-09 16:32:46] <%$MaffYuu> Sekiro Story is fire
[2023-01-09 16:32:46] <%DregBasher> purification ending best ending
[2023-01-09 16:32:59] <jeffrich> did you like resurrection?
[2023-01-09 16:32:59] <%+BarbViewer> I’m trying so hard to enjoy sekiro and it’s not working out. Maybe I’m just dogshit at it
[2023-01-09 16:33:00] <+Bat_Boss> Sekiro is much harder to cheese than Souls/ER. Just gotta get good
[2023-01-09 16:33:05] <%dogemaster500> i want sekiro 2 so so so bad Sadge
[2023-01-09 16:33:07] <%+MoskittoTV> When the "Cling Clang!" gameplay clicks its sooo satisfying
[2023-01-09 16:33:17] <%WhiskeyDing0> Only problem with sekiro is that there isnt going to be a sekiro 2 :(
[2023-01-09 16:33:21] <+ItzEcks> Ive been deep diving into your YT. The Symphony of the Night playthrough is fucking hilarious
[2023-01-09 16:33:23] <%$Septomor> what is sekiros story, Prince lost his throne and you retake it? also a dragon and some monkeys appear

[2023-01-09 16:33:36] <%Blastphemy1290> @BarbViewer you arent the only one, i thought it sucked. makes you play 1 way and if you dont like it, tough shit
[2023-01-09 16:33:38] <%+CakeBearer> They did add a fuckton of unnecessary enemies throughout the world
[2023-01-09 16:33:43] <%+TankerLutz> I remember trying to play Sekiro like Souls until Lady Butterfly

[2023-01-09 16:33:49] <%+JeremiahHix> yeah the res mod was eh
[2023-01-09 16:33:50] <%+MoskittoTV> It was the first to introduce more verticalality to souls games right?
[2023-01-09 16:33:50] <%$ChicCanyon> the lack of builds in sekiro allow the encounters to be tumed more tightly. they use it to their advantage
[2023-01-09 16:33:53] <%$RandyMarsh4108> I do like how the story for most FromSoft game boils down to, “if it moves kill it”

[2023-01-09 20:06:52] <dunpeal2064> I feel like that describes most gimmick levels, "In this level Mario is a fucking idiot"
[2023-01-09 20:06:55] <+MikeAndSarah> could you throw the block at the on/off from the left?
[2023-01-09 20:06:55] <BobIronthighs> Just run forward with the shell chasing you. You'll jump off the shell
