[2022-12-17 10:48:29] <monkyyyyyyyyy> my friend whos never played ow before got 20 losses and like 6 wins as kiriko and bap
[2022-12-17 10:48:35] <mixeryow> Im 4-0 on support, the new ana is insane if they don’t have kiriko
[2022-12-17 10:48:58] <%+Gios1337> Soujorn still broken?
[2022-12-17 10:49:03] <mixeryow> Yes
[2022-12-17 10:49:17] <%+Gios1337> Sadge
[2022-12-17 10:49:25] <monkyyyyyyyyy> especially when they dont go 4-10
[2022-12-17 10:49:27] <ChilledIron> sojurn = widow that can move and one shot
[2022-12-17 10:50:01] <%354hamtaro> when they have widow never move anywhere or else risk dying instantly :)
[2022-12-17 10:50:23] <mixeryow> You should do it like chipsa and put a text onstream with „games ruin by sojourn 2/4“
[2022-12-17 10:50:25] <%+Gios1337> Widow is ez to counter, soujorn is almos impossible
[2022-12-17 10:50:26] <mixeryow> Kappa
[2022-12-17 10:50:27] <%it_is_owen> lhcloudySadge widow is very fun to play but completely overshadowed
[2022-12-17 10:51:13] <%it_is_owen> lhcloudyStats true
[2022-12-17 10:51:33] <sirgoulas> widow op on gibraltar as well
[2022-12-17 10:51:42] <mixeryow> I miss gibraltar
[2022-12-17 10:51:53] <mixeryow> I would trade gibraltar for colosseo
[2022-12-17 10:51:54] <%it_is_owen> thats me
[2022-12-17 10:52:12] <%JantuneJ> lhcloudyHello hello, how are your games?
[2022-12-17 10:52:18] <mixeryow> I hope they never put havanna in the map cycle
[2022-12-17 10:52:21] <sirgoulas> nah glads woulkd always sub in ans on gibraltar and win all games
[2022-12-17 10:52:35] <%it_is_owen> all my favourite dps heroes are kinda wack
[2022-12-17 10:52:49] <mixeryow> I think havanna in 5vs5 is even more horrible
[2022-12-17 10:52:52] <sirgoulas> and left though
[2022-12-17 10:53:02] <stiches3000> Hi cloudy, quick question from someone new to overwatch - I noticed that there are 11 tanks in overwatch 2. That is a lot of tanks. So that means each tank should get around 10% of the playtime. If that's the case, then why do people pick roadhog every single game? Just wondering what the game play/strat reason is - thanks for answering my noob question!
[2022-12-17 10:53:12] <keppimaksavelat> ashe>widow
[2022-12-17 10:53:29] <sirgoulas> ye well meta got with queen buffed what could he do when meta was rush

[2022-12-17 10:55:41] <nordovitos> u in top500 with no shield?
[2022-12-17 10:56:02] <xfloleex> I got an idea for reinbuffs: Make firestrike do 100 damage again and have the pin work like genjidash. Get a kill with it, reset cooldown.
[2022-12-17 10:56:02] <mixeryow> What would you change on sojourn

[2022-12-17 11:13:32] <Retaliator3> Asian servers are doomed
[2022-12-17 11:13:34] <z0ne__> wow hog is still meta
[2022-12-17 11:13:44] <%+DaddyTiril> hog is always gonna be meta
[2022-12-17 11:13:47] <%354hamtaro> Asia just loves dive

[2022-12-17 11:14:01] <nicakados_bussy> the balance changes were really good
[2022-12-17 11:14:02] <Retaliator3> did they nerf Rein?
[2022-12-17 11:14:10] <%+vantablvckOW> hog will be meta as long as suzu exists and he has a one shot
[2022-12-17 11:14:43] <%+Gios1337> Bc orisa ult is bad, no?
[2022-12-17 11:15:10] <%+Gios1337> True
[2022-12-17 11:15:17] <%JuunasWasTaken> ill think of roadhog when roasting christmas ham
[2022-12-17 11:15:32] <%+vantablvckOW> i peaked gm5 on rein last szn now im rank 350 on hog still 70% WR and climbing
[2022-12-17 11:15:36] <nicakados_bussy> I'm really glad they made doomfist unplayable
[2022-12-17 11:15:47] <%Jerrelman31> blizzard no care rein REINLIFE
[2022-12-17 11:15:49] <%Ran5u> Orisa buff was stupid
[2022-12-17 11:15:52] <itsyaboisour> I think it was because sig is good against orissa and ow deva thought piercing ult would "fix" that
[2022-12-17 11:15:53] <%+DaddyTiril> my parents asked me yesterday if i wanted my christmas gifts like instantly or if i wanted to wait until chrismtas
[2022-12-17 11:15:54] <monkyyyyyyyyy> @vantablvckOW mid january their gonna get rid of 1 shot alegedly
[2022-12-17 11:16:01] <%+DaddyTiril> christmas would be boring without gifts
[2022-12-17 11:16:17] <%+DaddyTiril> I already know what I'm getting
[2022-12-17 11:16:18] <%+DaddyTiril> But I'm still waiting
[2022-12-17 11:16:19] <%+vantablvckOW> does playing no shield mess with your playing rein normally after?
[2022-12-17 11:16:25] <%+DaddyTiril> exactly??
[2022-12-17 11:16:40] <%+DaddyTiril> I'm getting a blanket from my grandma
[2022-12-17 11:16:43] <%+DaddyTiril> like one of those fluffy ones

[2022-12-17 11:18:04] <monkyyyyyyyyy> "its not me"
[2022-12-17 11:18:29] <pr0st04uvak> spicy buffs accompanied by hitbox increase
[2022-12-17 11:18:29] <%+vantablvckOW> when you go back to shield rein does it take you a bit to readjust?
[2022-12-17 11:18:34] <itsyaboisour> @magicturtle12 we all know "spicy" is gonna somehow nerf her again like increasing her hitbox but giving her + 0.05% heal from jagged blade
[2022-12-17 11:19:01] <biggus_cheddar> This rein is kinda based

[2022-12-17 11:59:43] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> @Porters_X2_Ray_Gun true rein pin is harder to hit
[2022-12-17 12:00:13] <%GIRLinMaleBody> hog brings nothing to the team
[2022-12-17 12:00:37] <Graboyd6561> i disagree/ hog does a lot dmg withjout hook
[2022-12-17 12:00:49] <Graboyd6561> like rightclick and primary
[2022-12-17 12:00:56] <%Magicturtle12> unless you just die due to the missed pin

[2022-12-17 12:01:05] <%Magicturtle12> hog doesn't really risk anything to hook

[2022-12-17 12:12:11] <%+vantablvckOW> who's the best rein you've ever played against?
[2022-12-17 12:12:15] <%GIRLinMaleBody> daaaamn

[2022-12-17 12:12:17] <snarky1236> well something along those lines
[2022-12-17 12:12:22] <Cpt_MikePilgrim> steelhardt still the best rein skin
[2022-12-17 12:12:35] <%GIRLinMaleBody> NA players shit talk EU when EU does the opposite LUL
[2022-12-17 12:12:37] <mixeryow> Cloudy do you still think that rein counters ramattra, after they buffed his hp in nemesis form and he has 675 hp now
[2022-12-17 12:12:42] <kapolaka> That opinion is just invalid
[2022-12-17 12:12:43] <%GIRLinMaleBody> draugr is cool
[2022-12-17 12:12:45] <%354hamtaro> @LhCloudy27 what about the trophyskin
[2022-12-17 12:12:46] <JuraForest> @GIRLinMaleBody Hog nerf: hook reverted to v.1.0
[2022-12-17 12:12:55] <raylx79> @snarky1236 was it a recent video
[2022-12-17 12:12:57] <skunky4x> Guan Yu best skin ever made
[2022-12-17 12:12:58] <cynderissuper> i like axes but the actual armor could be better imo
[2022-12-17 12:13:07] <%tokekberacun> ranking up killing your taste
[2022-12-17 12:13:07] <skunky4x> Wujing I mean
[2022-12-17 12:13:12] <snarky1236> what is guan yu again
[2022-12-17 12:13:20] <skunky4x> guan yu is bad

[2022-12-17 12:13:23] <snarky1236> oh
[2022-12-17 12:13:33] <ihelvete_> ew
[2022-12-17 12:13:37] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> I found the noobhunter video
[2022-12-17 12:13:38] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> Tyler1 Might Lose His Account & Sponsorship Soon! - Overwatch 2 Funny Moments 162
[2022-12-17 12:13:48] <raylx79> thx
[2022-12-17 12:13:48] <skunky4x> how is Wujin meme??
[2022-12-17 12:13:49] <%GIRLinMaleBody> why rein doesnt have a skin with the big sword
[2022-12-17 12:13:57] <mixeryow> Cloudy do you still think that rein counters ramattra, after they buffed his hp in nemesis form and he has 675 hp now
[2022-12-17 12:14:00] <skunky4x> Literally best rein skin ever made
[2022-12-17 12:14:01] <%354hamtaro> Conductor is fun
[2022-12-17 12:14:03] <skunky4x> WAy better than minotaur
[2022-12-17 12:14:14] <snarky1236> 2% to ramattra skin
[2022-12-17 12:14:14] <%FutureGrinta> catJAM
[2022-12-17 12:14:21] <OneManArmystar> 20%movement speed is massive
[2022-12-17 12:14:56] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ram will ignore rein and fisting ur teammates
[2022-12-17 12:14:59] <%WinstonsNK> he turns into a shit version of rein for 8 seconds, whereas you are a real version of rein for forever seconds
[2022-12-17 12:15:04] <skunky4x> But its the fact that's it piercing and you kill everybody behind Rein aswell :3
[2022-12-17 12:15:05] <OneManArmystar> Now do same with Rein vs Ram in Nemesis
[2022-12-17 12:15:16] <%+Aceattack> ramattra will be bit more fun to at least go into enemy backline with speed
[2022-12-17 12:15:22] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> @OneManArmystar cant do that alone
[2022-12-17 12:15:25] <Theaap> how much damage does he do?
[2022-12-17 12:15:29] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he hits faster, has longer range and runs faster now, he is literally better rein
[2022-12-17 12:15:30] <mixeryow> After the buffs this hero is busted
[2022-12-17 12:15:48] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> cloudy i found the noobhunter video

[2022-12-17 12:16:39] <skunky4x> Dva bomb nano :3
[2022-12-17 12:16:44] <mixeryow> But ramattras ult is way easier to hit
[2022-12-17 12:16:47] <Cpt_MikePilgrim> full charge nano zarya final raid boss
[2022-12-17 12:16:50] <mixeryow> Has extremly high range
[2022-12-17 12:16:58] <%+Aceattack> the extra armor helps him stay alive too

[2022-12-17 12:17:21] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> this song is so fire
[2022-12-17 12:17:22] <%GIRLinMaleBody> to make it fair dont use shield

[2022-12-17 12:26:48] <mixeryow> My worst hero would be genji
[2022-12-17 12:27:24] <%shigaeki> ppl complaining about no shield when you can actually reach their elo without using all abilities is cringe
[2022-12-17 12:27:35] <+johnytheketchup> do your teammates hate you on here
[2022-12-17 12:27:48] <y04rm0m> @mixeryow they stop banning after OW became f2p....I had account banned every 1-2 week before OW2
[2022-12-17 12:27:52] <%+Aceattack> nobody in this sr should complain about no shields though
[2022-12-17 12:28:10] <%mehulsharma27> how u already got gold hammer on noshield
[2022-12-17 12:28:33] <mixeryow> Its so boring that the only hog counter is literally hog, orisa or ana
[2022-12-17 12:28:39] <%mehulsharma27> i see
[2022-12-17 12:28:41] <%Magicturtle12> yuge

[2022-12-17 12:29:00] <+MythosDeity> It's kind of crazy how easy it still is to get banned in this game considering how expensive the skins are now.
[2022-12-17 12:29:06] <%tokekberacun> !ping

[2022-12-17 12:29:42] <%+Aceattack> on the bright side is this really worse than meta you played last year in ow1
[2022-12-17 12:29:50] <mixeryow> I think the oneshot was not the problem

[2022-12-17 12:31:19] <mixeryow> How to win every fight on payload: kiriko ult + nano + ramattra ult
[2022-12-17 12:31:22] <y04rm0m> Every tank in T500 except for cloudy plays roadhog
[2022-12-17 12:31:24] <mixeryow> Unstoppable
[2022-12-17 12:31:30] <%+Aceattack> next season identity buff will be reinhardt surely
[2022-12-17 12:32:00] <%+vantablvckOW> nerf rein hammer dmg by 25% and give it heaadshot
[2022-12-17 12:32:22] <y04rm0m> Rein buff- "homing firestrike, but damage falls to 75"
[2022-12-17 12:32:23] <%mehulsharma27> make shield 3000 OMEGALUL
[2022-12-17 12:32:27] <mixeryow> Is this schlager music
[2022-12-17 12:32:29] <%tokekberacun> make reins hammer bigger
[2022-12-17 12:32:29] <subtitle_sam> Just make flamestrike do 100 dmg
[2022-12-17 12:32:48] <%+vantablvckOW> make firestrike do 10 dmg and give him 10 of them
[2022-12-17 12:33:03] <Theaap> Nice carry @LhCloudy27
[2022-12-17 12:33:14] <subtitle_sam> I think flamestrikes should heal rein 30hp for every enemy he hits
[2022-12-17 12:33:15] <Guts__TV> what about a 2-3 seconds of movement speed buff after charge? @LhCloudy27
[2022-12-17 12:33:20] <mixeryow> Now he goes ana
[2022-12-17 12:33:21] <mixeryow> Watch
[2022-12-17 12:33:24] <%mehulsharma27> i wish they buff brig and make her rein 2.0
[2022-12-17 12:33:24] <+maktrophies> how many times did you hold up your shield from habits?
[2022-12-17 12:33:29] <muhdyk> firestrike now burn u
[2022-12-17 12:33:31] <y04rm0m> firestrike already does 100damage
[2022-12-17 12:33:47] <mixeryow> How is hog even dying against your comp
[2022-12-17 12:33:48] <subtitle_sam> @y04rm0m ur dumb no it doesnt
[2022-12-17 12:33:53] <mixeryow> That should be impossible
[2022-12-17 12:34:19] <%aboomer26> bring back 1600 shield ?
[2022-12-17 12:34:20] <Cpt_MikePilgrim> idea: remove firestrike and make rein throw the hammer and when he doesnt have hammer he starts punching people
[2022-12-17 12:34:45] <mixeryow> Just give rein 1000 hp and no shield
[2022-12-17 12:34:45] <%tokekberacun> give rein a gun

[2022-12-17 12:35:11] <mixeryow> Give rein a bazooka
[2022-12-17 12:35:17] <+peekaayfire> give pin  2 charges Kappa
[2022-12-17 12:35:20] <Brad_Jr> IM 20 MINUTES IN Q HELP
[2022-12-17 12:35:28] <%Magicturtle12> PagMan
[2022-12-17 12:35:46] <Cpt_MikePilgrim> make pin reset on kills like genji dash
[2022-12-17 12:36:11] <subtitle_sam> Shatter should either stun longer or give rein movementspeed/dmg reduction
[2022-12-17 12:36:18] <+peekaayfire> @Cpt_MikePilgrim that would be so wild
[2022-12-17 12:36:19] <terrestrialbug> no shield again? PogChamp
[2022-12-17 12:36:20] <y04rm0m> @Cpt_MikePilgrim no

[2022-12-17 12:36:56] <mixeryow> Hog need less hp
[2022-12-17 12:37:00] <mixeryow> Thats the real Problem
[2022-12-17 12:37:14] <Porters_X2_Ray_Gun> they were talking all that shit in all chat and now they losing
[2022-12-17 12:37:29] <y04rm0m> Change rein's charge like they did with doom's jump
[2022-12-17 12:37:29] <%shigaeki> they shouuld just nerf vape
[2022-12-17 12:37:34] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> maybe when they do the "soft rework"
[2022-12-17 12:37:41] <mixeryow> Less hp, removing his ult cancel and beeing able to cancel his ult if you rock him for example
[2022-12-17 12:37:43] <subtitle_sam> Its legit JUST kiriko that makes hog super dumb
[2022-12-17 12:37:46] <mixeryow> Just like ow1 hog
[2022-12-17 12:37:56] <+peekaayfire> i hate when my team taunts mid game and then the enemy tries way harder lol
[2022-12-17 12:37:58] <%aboomer26> 12s vape should be better than 8s
[2022-12-17 12:38:10] <%+vantablvckOW> is kiriko suzu more broken than bap immort in double shield
[2022-12-17 12:38:12] <%the_nice_guy1000> idk they just needed to reduce his 40% damage reduction when vaping to 20% or remove it
[2022-12-17 12:38:12] <muhdyk> either reducing HP or reducing his movement speed when using vape
[2022-12-17 12:38:13] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> they said that first they nerf the 1 shot and then later on theres gonan be a soft rework i think
[2022-12-17 12:38:14] <subtitle_sam> Why not? I think everyone would agree kiriko being gone would be better
[2022-12-17 12:38:20] <y04rm0m> bring back boss Brig to make kiriko irrelevant

[2022-12-17 13:06:53] <mixeryow> Orisas ult is in my opinion good
[2022-12-17 13:07:06] <%Magicturtle12> orisaa buff for instance does nothing to the fact lucio can counter orissa ult 100% of the time
[2022-12-17 13:07:09] <ofterity> Bro I  try to que with my friend and I cant get into a game. Any reason for that?
[2022-12-17 13:07:18] <endcosmos> does more than shatter
[2022-12-17 13:07:22] <+Nyhttz> Blizzard never test the game
[2022-12-17 13:07:24] <%+Aceattack> orisa main buff is the dmg fall off
[2022-12-17 13:07:35] <y04rm0m> @mixeryow Orisa ult is amazing...if you orisa ult and your echo copies an orisa and ult 2 second later
[2022-12-17 13:07:39] <mixeryow> I dont need to get 2-3 kills everytime but its good to survive or make 3 enemys low/group them up
[2022-12-17 13:07:56] <ofterity> Yes, Comp I selected open que and my friend went healer and I went Flex. Still we stuck at 50min que and we reset twice
[2022-12-17 13:08:17] <endcosmos> why didn't they just buff the ramp up
[2022-12-17 13:08:30] <+greeds7> you just bully lol
[2022-12-17 13:08:40] <Theaap> Dont play open que buddy @ofterity
[2022-12-17 13:08:40] <%354hamtaro> Orisa ult needs followup from your team to get value

[2022-12-17 13:09:57] <%anfieldow> hey cloudy and chat
[2022-12-17 13:10:03] <itsyaboisour> @keiytan no
[2022-12-17 13:10:10] <Zalar___> nah i agree her ult is shit but ye
[2022-12-17 13:10:15] <+roob_420> Are you seriously ranked 224 without a shield Lmao
[2022-12-17 13:10:19] <+kettlez> Morning everyone
[2022-12-17 13:10:24] <%liharekka185> have you tried ramatra after the buffs?
[2022-12-17 13:10:26] <biggus_cheddar> Nothing will ever compare to OG brig ult where armor stayed after the ult ended
[2022-12-17 13:10:33] <%+Gios1337> kiriko is the best ult in the game
[2022-12-17 13:10:38] <$TardigradesAreAwesome> unpopular opinion: OW1 sombra EMP best ult ever
[2022-12-17 13:10:40] <+roob_420> Holy shit
[2022-12-17 13:10:46] <%Magicturtle12> even mercy 5 man res?
[2022-12-17 13:10:46] <Fischkopf2222> can u show winrate?
[2022-12-17 13:10:52] <evilstunky> 8 second blade?
[2022-12-17 13:10:53] <%anfieldow> graviton is the best
[2022-12-17 13:10:53] <CALOVI96> yeah it's even better of the huge ress
[2022-12-17 13:10:58] <Fischkopf2222> ty
[2022-12-17 13:11:04] <+AGirlCalledJim> @TardigradesAreAwesome is that unpopular?
[2022-12-17 13:11:22] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> do you get a rank up or down next win?
[2022-12-17 13:11:27] <rossad96> Mercy valk insta res was the most op ult
[2022-12-17 13:11:44] <+kettlez> what would you think about an ability that increases your cooldowns slows them from coming off cooldown
[2022-12-17 13:11:50] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> woah thats great...
[2022-12-17 13:12:07] <Stiched> do you like ow 1 or 2 more?
[2022-12-17 13:12:13] <%anfieldow> torb lv turret is the best in ow ever had
[2022-12-17 13:12:14] <trashh0g> Torb 1.0 ult op tier 3 turret
[2022-12-17 13:12:19] <+kettlez> it would be a little bit less annoying than being hacked tho
[2022-12-17 13:12:22] <mixeryow> I dont believe that kiriko ult is better than a 6 man rez
[2022-12-17 13:12:29] <mixeryow> 5
[2022-12-17 13:12:39] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> lmao just sit down and get a 5k
[2022-12-17 13:12:49] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> 6k
[2022-12-17 13:12:51] <quisqui97> 500 hp torb was so funny
[2022-12-17 13:12:54] <%+Aceattack> when torb threw armor packs at you
[2022-12-17 13:13:11] <+kettlez> it would be irritating for the muscle memory of reacting for sure, it was just a thought I had been pondering for a while
[2022-12-17 13:13:17] <+kral_king_> maybe avoid him ? lol

[2022-12-17 13:13:29] <itsyaboisour> the same guy is sniping you as well every game
[2022-12-17 13:13:32] <y04rm0m> That guy is amazing on Sojourn though...his healer just sucks
[2022-12-17 13:13:44] <+kettlez> I remember 5 man rez, mercy would just hide instead of healing, so that your team could come back
[2022-12-17 13:14:06] <+kettlez> I really hated it
[2022-12-17 13:14:22] <%+Aceattack> even after 5 man rez there was a time when mercy valk was op
[2022-12-17 13:14:25] <+kettlez> you'd win a fight then you'd lose soon as the team came back because you'd have 0 cooldowns
[2022-12-17 13:14:29] <raylx79> LUL
[2022-12-17 13:14:30] <shmeet_lord> wait did everyone respawn on mercy
[2022-12-17 13:14:33] <mixeryow> I didnt played at this time, i started on season 7 and mercy got reworked 1 month before
[2022-12-17 13:14:36] <evilstunky> Wrecking ball reinhardt
[2022-12-17 13:14:37] <%aboomer26> Oh that guy Arisu again
[2022-12-17 13:14:48] <%+Gios1337> mercy rez was very bad for the health of the game
[2022-12-17 13:15:02] <+kettlez> I wouldn't be against a 2 man rez in ow2
[2022-12-17 13:15:06] <mixeryow> Pov i started at season 7 and my peak is still masters and not gm
[2022-12-17 13:15:08] <biggus_cheddar> This mercy is smart
[2022-12-17 13:15:15] <mixeryow> (Ow1 had 35 seasons)
[2022-12-17 13:15:26] <Lepoks> @shmeet_lord everyone respawned on their corpse where they died, so if all 5 died on the same spot mercy could ress al 5 of them
[2022-12-17 13:15:41] <evilstunky> @mixeryow 36
[2022-12-17 13:15:42] <%+Gios1337> Unlucky maps
[2022-12-17 13:15:50] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> @biggus_cheddar i dont think this mercy likes cloudy very much
[2022-12-17 13:16:08] <mixeryow> I try to get gm with ana
[2022-12-17 13:16:11] <endcosmos> they don't know how to play with a rein with no shield
[2022-12-17 13:16:22] <%monkyyyyyyyyy> maybe her avoids are full
[2022-12-17 13:16:23] <mixeryow> My winrate is 82% currently, i think im better than my current rank
[2022-12-17 13:16:25] <+kettlez> like if mercy could rez 2 players during valk, that would be super cool
[2022-12-17 13:16:29] <raylx79> nice

[2022-12-17 16:11:27] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @sansaburo u can click on clog and choose "pause chat: mouseover" really useful when u want to ban someone and not misslick
[2022-12-17 16:11:29] <free3happy> What do you think they’ll end up doing with hog? Any ideas?
[2022-12-17 16:11:32] <@%billmcgreezy> they just need to remove roadhog until his rework

[2022-12-17 16:12:26] <%anung> hog 1 Clueless
[2022-12-17 16:12:30] <@%PayMeToThrow> they said they are taking away hogs one shot for a rework

[2022-12-17 17:49:58] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content
