[2023-01-03 14:23:55] <%Sebleh> Stacking starfalls just adds an extra starfall
[2023-01-03 14:24:08] <%Sebleh> Each starfall gets their own timer but they stack on top of each other.
[2023-01-03 14:24:26] <OblivionJager> it's not like rain of fire
[2023-01-03 14:24:28] <+CruuuLest> @Bodkins_UK u can obviously play em on 20 keys, but getting into keys wont be as easy as a DH,Rogue etc
[2023-01-03 14:24:41] <+CruuuLest> @Bodkins_UK basically u can, but not as good as other specs
[2023-01-03 14:24:46] <CyberPane> might be a weird question, but at what point do you wanna starfall over starsurge?
[2023-01-03 14:24:55] <CyberPane> like basics
[2023-01-03 14:25:07] <Kevin_Arvoo> 2 targets or more :P @CyberPane

[2023-01-03 14:35:37] <+anderssons97> @Naguura What is your touch on masterloot in PUG groups with greedy selfish players? Could a good thing be to have masterloot in guildruns the random drop in PUG groups? Sorry, semi-frustrated question after 3h in raid and leader just snagged pretty much everything himself. BTW hope you are doing fantastic Nagura! :D

[2023-01-03 14:39:05] <+anderssons97> But what I mean is that is is kinda strange to let a pug decide if u get loot or not instead of just a random drop
[2023-01-03 14:39:21] <iEddieO> the pug doesnt decide if you get loot
[2023-01-03 14:39:26] <iEddieO> if you roll and win you get it

[2023-01-03 14:43:09] <+bigtilter> apparently they have a threat table, but only healer threat counts
[2023-01-03 14:43:12] <+bnts__> at least as druid u can shaoeshift to get the slow off

[2023-01-03 14:44:42] <Raekthechef> @PwndByBunnies still not as bad as RLP - fortified 21 first boss explosion after you drop the circle off hits for like 300k per player so if you're not topped off you get 1-shot
[2023-01-03 14:44:42] <NoxOnecarD> yeah you get more rating if you depletet it by like 10 mins or less
[2023-01-03 14:44:45] <Komporius> so that people wont leave if the timer runs out maybe?
[2023-01-03 14:44:47] <Andersonmps> The balls move into you if you have stack of the slow, i think.
[2023-01-03 14:44:48] <Raekthechef> by unavoidable damage on fortified
[2023-01-03 14:44:53] <+Player089> @DementiusTV I don't know if that is true tbh. They definitely move ontop of you even if you stand still, and then you are 100% dead
[2023-01-03 14:45:04] <+Matt_rmel> The orbs go towards the healer usually
[2023-01-03 14:45:12] <NavalRainDrops> yup got chased the whole fight last night
[2023-01-03 14:45:13] <%+asmolbunnyintwitch> they chase the target taht gets he most heals

[2023-01-03 14:46:19] <+tavi2530> the orbs chase the tank more than the healers ebcause tanks usually outheal the healer
[2023-01-03 14:46:19] <CyberPane> I think they have a random fixate and after a while they go to where you last stod
[2023-01-03 14:46:23] <CyberPane> that's from what i realise
[2023-01-03 14:46:45] <+Player089> @NoxOnecarD The slow is dispelable, no? So tank can call for dispels in order to move. Also, during storming you are immune to slow and thus can also move freely. So you time movement with storming and dispels
[2023-01-03 14:46:46] <+Mulfire> i feel like blizzard were needlessly mean to healers on this boss
[2023-01-03 14:46:50] <+tavi2530> no, the orbs have internal aggro. They will go for healer or tank. If the priest fades for example, you will see them directly change direction
[2023-01-03 14:47:05] <+underworldr> did they remove shapeshifting drops speed debuff stacks or is it just not worth the dps drop from doing so?
[2023-01-03 14:47:10] <Andersonmps> Just read it. The orbs chase who have the most healing threat.

[2023-01-03 15:15:29] <ardwicky> It was.  The state governments sued to tobacco manufacturers and forced them to put money into anti-smoking campaigns and legislation

[2023-01-03 15:21:56] <jexx1337> I think the problem is, it isnt advertised enough to younger people so once they "realize", it is too late since they are addicted.

[2023-01-03 15:24:30] <NoxOnecarD> Some Teens start Smoking because they heard it would reduce their stress and they believe in it.
[2023-01-03 15:24:36] <%+JohnG228> I smoked for over 30 years, and knew it was bad for me the whole time.
[2023-01-03 15:24:40] <%+TrYsIx7> Same as Alcohol espacially in Germany
[2023-01-03 15:24:41] <Marigato> also in countries like Croatia where every adult smokes and cigs are really easy to come by, kids see that and they dont care
[2023-01-03 15:24:44] <%Anelit21> Its very wide topic.
[2023-01-03 15:24:45] <settfan> im glad they have those anti campaigns because they have so much pro smoking influence in films and  shows
[2023-01-03 15:25:03] <%+TrYsIx7> Happy New Year <3
[2023-01-03 15:25:08] <+Kerailol> YOo NAgura your Stream is something else. I just had it open for like half an hour and didnt watch it because i am working right now but your stream kinda has a podcast feeling also. First time it feels like that. Props right there.
[2023-01-03 15:25:13] <%+JohnG228> I started when I was around 13 like you said to be "cool" and be like the adults.
[2023-01-03 15:25:19] <udk3_dev> you should google "australian cigarette packets" and see how that effects
[2023-01-03 15:25:24] <%danjidogs> Hey Naguura, regarding that Azure skip down (falling), is it skipping mobs or just skipping the fly emotion?
[2023-01-03 15:25:29] <%Anelit21> You are kinda going against your own presence , true.

[2023-01-03 15:25:45] <+ArchDragon231> Funny how every kid who told his parents to stop smoking at 10 started smoking by 18 or so
[2023-01-03 15:25:54] <Marigato> @udk3_dev we also have those pictures, nobody cares xd
[2023-01-03 15:26:02] <+maitrekirby> if you see your dad at 70 healthy and he s been smoking his all life no wonder you would wanna try

[2023-01-03 15:29:48] <%Sebleh> @itsclubby iirc it‚Äôs supposedly because of the chemicals that make it a fluid or because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù than smoke so it‚Äôs perceived as less damaging but still forms the addiction? I‚Äôve heard multiple but it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint.
[2023-01-03 15:29:52] <Andersonmps> @Andersonmps CDC

[2023-01-03 15:30:35] <Andersonmps> Its te inhaling of raw nicotine and the temperature burns your lungs too. Its bad
[2023-01-03 15:30:37] <+maitrekirby> you inhale more
[2023-01-03 15:30:37] <%TheTrakker> healthier than smoking is not a very big archievement LuL
[2023-01-03 15:30:38] <lomiko2012> it last longer

[2023-01-03 15:30:41] <+maitrekirby> and vape more
[2023-01-03 15:30:42] <+PsyStormZ> The Smoke and Vaping are horrible. Nicotine with a normal delivery like gum or something 1000% safer. Our body has nicotine receptors
[2023-01-03 15:30:43] <%+asmolbunnyintwitch> vaping is awful

[2023-01-03 15:30:46] <+maitrekirby> so more nicotine
[2023-01-03 15:30:48] <Kevin_Arvoo> people who vape are like, oh it smells good lets do it more LUL

[2023-01-03 15:31:08] <+kozmik01> I went from smoking to an e cig which was the early vaping and I was 24/7 using my pen
[2023-01-03 15:31:09] <+Lambbosbread> ur lungs dont love vaping
[2023-01-03 15:31:10] <Toegrinder> wtf
[2023-01-03 15:31:11] <%Sebleh> You also can‚Äôt make cigarettes smell like blueberries so it‚Äôs easier to market vapes to the wrong people.

[2023-01-03 15:31:22] <+kit_cakez> vaping is just bad for different reasons than smoking

[2023-01-03 15:31:52] <+djangorino1992> the thing with cigarettes is the tar which is a little bit worse than nicotine
[2023-01-03 15:32:02] <%Alasse_> A friend once tried to make our national New Year's snack, oliebollen (kinda like round donut-like balls normally deep-fried) in his air fryer... that did NOT turn out well monkaS
[2023-01-03 15:32:03] <%prestkenth> Here they say start snus, stop smoking.. My mother did, now she does both. Fucking dumbass
[2023-01-03 15:32:06] <+PsyStormZ> Nicotine in tobacco brings illness and death to millions of people. Yet nicotine in its pure form has the potential to be a valuable pharmaceutical agent

[2023-01-03 18:08:58] <%+LtJenkins> @silentkillervgc I thikn there should be a way to dispel the orbs on last boss AV. Or they go away when someone hits them. I don't think it's good design how they hunt down the healer for the entire fight.

[2023-01-03 18:34:34] <Akyran> @2000ish it probably makes sense to check the dungeons out before in video guide format & maybe check some  routes in MDT
[2023-01-03 18:34:37] <%Sebleh> But still M+ being "competitive content" means that you're looking to not fail.
[2023-01-03 18:34:37] <%+nevernude1> @cayna OMEGALUL 0% chance they deplete this key
[2023-01-03 18:34:41] <%2000ish> @Akyran ok gotcha
[2023-01-03 18:34:45] <Akyran> but then to really get xp you just have to play them
[2023-01-03 18:34:51] <Akyran> its never the same than watching a video
