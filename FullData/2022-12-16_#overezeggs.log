[2022-12-16 02:42:11] <$BigSerg_98> maybe have her thermal sight be a passive for her for like 2 seconds on kill?
[2022-12-16 02:42:14] <%Port503> I agree. The teams that I've been getting are sad.

[2022-12-16 02:43:10] <%XIII_Aether> Like a sonar similar to hanzos if he even still has it, but it doesn’t get triggered til someone walks near/over it. I’d like that over her poison bc the poison is extremely weak both health and dmg wise, and extremely obvious, meanwhile spiders are sneaky in real life lol.
[2022-12-16 02:43:11] <DeadCell007> ikr whenever im doing best in games nowadays im like yea were gona get clapped

[2022-12-16 02:47:47] <%XIII_Aether> I feel I’d like that more
[2022-12-16 02:47:52] <$BigSerg_98> see now that would be wonderful tbh faster charge up on kill
[2022-12-16 02:48:36] <%$the_vowki> IM FREEEEEEE
[2022-12-16 02:48:36] <%XIII_Aether> It’d have to be a small change though per hit. Like 5% per fully charged hit, so you can’t cheese it with spammy shots, but you’re also not just NUKING tanks!
[2022-12-16 02:48:50] <%$CoopKaiju> I'd take recoil management over shot timing. also, if I'm making my shots, I shouldn't get punished with weaker followups

[2022-12-16 09:03:30] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> there's a huge spread of money made, most of ANY content creator on ANY platform is not earning their money mostly from twitch/youtube, or whatever platform, they make more from other sources after a certain point

[2022-12-16 18:51:36] <%+xScarlet_xo> cc is the same as saying litres, for example 250cc engine is 0.25 L engine :)
[2022-12-16 18:51:43] <%Dang_old_Dixie> I'd love to visit the US one day and just go coast to coast on a motorcycle. That's on my bucket list.
[2022-12-16 18:51:47] <%ImKhaos_> I want a bike so bad but I’d need to learn to ride a bicycle first 💀
[2022-12-16 18:51:53] <%$that_bly> 250cc is easier to handle for beginners
[2022-12-16 18:51:57] <%$CoopKaiju> I don't thing they have one ezeggSMAGE
[2022-12-16 18:52:13] <%MochaCheetahh> id say got low to mid then that way you can go faster when you get used to it

[2022-12-16 18:52:21] <%+xScarlet_xo> yes
[2022-12-16 18:52:30] <%LFVelasco> it's a volume in the motor, afaik. Disclaimer, idk much
[2022-12-16 18:52:31] <%MochaCheetahh> upgrade if you want that speed later
[2022-12-16 18:52:38] VIEWERS: 231
[2022-12-16 18:52:42] <%LFVelasco> yes, it's fine
[2022-12-16 18:52:42] <%$CoopKaiju> 250cc plenty
[2022-12-16 18:52:45] <%$that_bly> and better gas mileage
[2022-12-16 18:52:51] <%$KuromiKate> Egg go zoooom
[2022-12-16 18:52:59] <%+xScarlet_xo> 250 is fine, probably max out at 110 -120 at absolute max
[2022-12-16 18:53:06] <%+xScarlet_xo> but it will be lighter so easier to ride
[2022-12-16 18:53:12] <%Dang_old_Dixie> @SpeedoGoat A person with taste, I see.
[2022-12-16 18:53:18] <%$CoopKaiju> put it up
[2022-12-16 18:53:34] <%$RatAcid> CC is cubic centimeter
[2022-12-16 18:53:43] <%MochaCheetahh> just dont forget to get some protective gear like the jackets and stuff
[2022-12-16 18:54:10] <%$CoopKaiju> but you gotta do bike VODd

[2022-12-16 18:54:28] <%$RatAcid> a centimeter... cubicly
[2022-12-16 18:54:32] <%+xScarlet_xo> best way to think about it is its the same as litres, 500cc = 0.5L 1000cc = 1L
[2022-12-16 18:54:40] <%$that_bly> basically how big the engine is
[2022-12-16 18:54:40] VIEWERS: 226
[2022-12-16 18:54:53] <%CleaningCube> cc is displacement of the cylinders
[2022-12-16 18:54:54] <%MochaCheetahh> and riding a motorcycle gets really cold
[2022-12-16 18:54:58] <%ImKhaos_> The geo guessers are insane

[2022-12-16 18:55:10] <%$that_bly> lol that geoguesser guy
[2022-12-16 18:55:14] <%$CoopKaiju> engine smaller, so cc better since most bike engines are sub 1L
[2022-12-16 18:55:19] <%Dang_old_Dixie> 100% some geoguessr people are out there could be kidnapped and blidfolded and put on a plane, and they'd just be like *sniff* smells like cambodia
