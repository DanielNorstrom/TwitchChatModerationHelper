[2022-12-07 12:52:22] <%onaga236> that just makes me think of the socs and greasers thing in the outsiders  thwThink
[2022-12-07 12:52:26] <%KarmaAndExile> the problem with Tim Burton is that he can easily end up being a parody of himself

[2022-12-07 12:53:44] <%KarmaAndExile> Tim Burton went from Outcast to Normie doogLaugh

[2022-12-07 12:54:33] <%onaga236> how am i just finding out that he did the dumbo movie anneLol
[2022-12-07 12:54:35] <%puffMaggie> i had a lot of faith in Henry Selick but Wendell and Wild just didnt hit :(
[2022-12-07 12:54:35] <%+Kayla2102> I find a lot of Tim Burton underwhelming and overhyped. I was worried about Wednesday but everyone has said good things
[2022-12-07 12:54:38] <@%Amarienn> yes it was a response to the Adam West stuff
[2022-12-07 12:54:39] <Mex_tf2> reminds of the The "they hate me" Robinsons meme LUL

[2022-12-07 12:55:18] <%$Ektrix> all of the above a little bit
[2022-12-07 12:55:18] <%bromanatee> not sure if  batman was that mainstream at the time that Tim Burton made his movies
[2022-12-07 12:55:22] <bleak_bunny> yeah he got boring over the years
[2022-12-07 12:55:31] <iSeesaw> sleepy hollow is probably the only semi serious thing he's done I can remember
[2022-12-07 12:55:37] <%KarmaAndExile> it's like the old "Tim Burton's Secret Formula" video
[2022-12-07 12:55:41] <@%Amarienn> I think lately he has been less doing things out of creative ideas and more like "these are Tim Burton things lets put a random assortment of them in a movie"
[2022-12-07 12:55:46] <%midwinterlilly> and Cathere Zeta Jones as Morticia was such a great cast havent seen her in stuff forever
[2022-12-07 12:55:50] <lizard_wizard_ixalotl> its great
[2022-12-07 12:55:52] <%+Empty_Cognizance> beetlejuice was one of my favs growing up
[2022-12-07 12:55:54] <%puffMaggie> Sleepy Hollow is up there with the ones i like

[2022-12-07 12:56:39] <+Ebony71> @bromanatee yes and no. Superhero movies were very much niche around that time but Batman kinda is one of the heroes that stays in the media even by normal entertainment fans

[2022-12-07 13:55:26] <+amythist> I am a bit concerned by the number of random objects laying around that seem to be carrying an electrical charge
[2022-12-07 13:55:38] <+Xaphlyer> I could never play a game like this but just watching them makes my brain shut off and relax
[2022-12-07 13:55:51] <%DanVelly> since it's atleast part mouse this would make it Pika cheese doogHmm
