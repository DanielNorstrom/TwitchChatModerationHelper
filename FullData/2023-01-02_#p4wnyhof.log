[2023-01-02 13:37:22] <+sintech1349> Basically the Vapor Chamber that sits directly on the GPU Die and the Vram has a malfuction and causes the card to heat up to 110¬∞ celsius which causes around 20% performance loss cause they throttle down... and its not a one in a million shot nearly 75% of cards are affected

[2023-01-02 13:52:22] <+sintech1349> @AboutSelphy So my 2nd PC has a Ryzen 5 3600X and this is a little bit slower than yours and i get easy 140 fps in Warzone on 1080p
[2023-01-02 13:52:27] <+taskenshiro> 1ms sounds better
[2023-01-02 13:52:50] <+IgnifaziusTV> normal humans have roughly 200ms reaction time, so the 3 ms are obviously pretty important Kappa
[2023-01-02 13:52:52] <%xr0bertox> under 10ms system latency is nice
[2023-01-02 13:52:54] <+sintech1349> @AboutSelphy What RAM are you running?
[2023-01-02 13:53:12] <%+AboutSelphy> @sintech1349 i dont talk about warzone

[2023-01-02 13:54:58] <+brooksie359> Monitors are so much more complicated than just 1ms response time. you can look at many of the monitors that have marketing with 1ms response time but if you actually look at how they refresh they usually work vastly differently. Personally I just do not want overshoot or ghosting and I am good.
[2023-01-02 13:54:59] <+IgnifaziusTV> @budgod oh, ofc, my bad. gamers obviusly have <20ms reaction time LUL

[2023-01-02 15:56:38] <%Kalle2318> okay. I thought I was missing something :D
[2023-01-02 15:56:42] <+ShooshMeister> It takes quite a while for you to get acquainted with the mechanics of the new battle ground setup!
[2023-01-02 15:57:00] <%+shroomy_fatty> @p4wnyhof  what is your opinion about marvel snap?
[2023-01-02 15:57:11] <+RaikkoLV> these boars are so weak and only 4 players left
[2023-01-02 15:57:45] <+RaikkoLV> 1v1 already :D
[2023-01-02 15:58:14] <+ShooshMeister> You are getting totally robbed with not receiving a single divide shield through the match!
