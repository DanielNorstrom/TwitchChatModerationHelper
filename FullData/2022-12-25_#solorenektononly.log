[2022-12-25 15:28:59] <lilCACTUSS9> There's been a Trojan virus on my laptop and has been selling my League, Netflix, Steam, Facebook data to people. I can't believe it took me so long to realize my accounts being hacked constantly has something to do with a virus on my laptop. Anyway, someone got into my lol acc and messed everything up. Changed my name to HAckedLOL, messed up my rune pages and got a chat ban for me. I fixed it now thanks to Riot support.
