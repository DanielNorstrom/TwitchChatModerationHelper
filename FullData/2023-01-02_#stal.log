[2023-01-02 15:55:24] <%Kenyis> I enjoyed Fire Emblem Blazing Sword
[2023-01-02 15:55:24] <vixen74> what class are you playing?
[2023-01-02 15:55:27] <June_Aether> What’s really good about Tactics Ogre? Is the story good?
[2023-01-02 15:55:29] <%BowlingBobby> Fire Emblem: Fates was notorious with its relatively controversial "rub your characters with the stylus" minigame pepeLaugh
[2023-01-02 15:55:36] <%spellsword91> More into classic FE myself
[2023-01-02 15:55:38] <%Kenyis> All 3 lords in the game are winners
[2023-01-02 15:55:40] <+kumazoku_> I also like how there are like 3 diff routes and stuff depending on whether you go Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic

[2023-01-02 16:00:06] <+kumazoku_> The Direct presentation for it looks AMAZING
[2023-01-02 16:00:07] <%MishaMerina> I like my PS5 but I hate streaming on it because it like...auto-censors any content that the game devs consider spoilers
[2023-01-02 16:00:40] <%$Shalfu> there's an option to not censor anything in the system menu iirc
[2023-01-02 16:01:04] <%MishaMerina> I was born and raised on the sony console so I think I'll always be a console fan at heart. But I can also acknowledge that PC is supreme
