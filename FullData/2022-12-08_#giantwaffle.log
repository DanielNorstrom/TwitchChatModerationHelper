[2022-12-08 16:31:02] <TheMSable> The 3 should block the 3
[2022-12-08 16:31:08] <+wall_facer> you return true at the first tree smaller than your current one
[2022-12-08 16:31:27] <guniu> you return true on the first smaller tree

[2022-12-08 16:53:28] <%KoniQ111> maybe you can start with addition and then break on condition
[2022-12-08 16:53:42] <DrNeurosis> count in the if case too if you're going to do that and break

[2022-12-08 16:53:49] <Stonan> Use breakpoints to see the values as they're executing.  Seeing just the output can give you false results.

[2022-12-08 16:55:23] <Schwee09> can you just += 1 at the start of every loop, and then just break in the if?
[2022-12-08 16:55:25] <TomatenPleb> We need some recursion in this
[2022-12-08 16:55:30] <Stonan> @Smithii Sounds like a DMT trip

[2022-12-08 17:41:05] <+ForceBan> you need to manage the the overworking hours in each sector
[2022-12-08 17:41:05] <Jummit> @Baske_T fair point
[2022-12-08 17:41:07] <Aladire87> I was playing this so much last night to learn how things work and  I learned that the more power you use in a sector, the more workers you need to keep dangerous working condition down.

[2022-12-08 17:43:30] <+ForceBan> each building uses workers pause ones your not us in mostly then workers will move to places needed
[2022-12-08 17:43:32] <%Dagmoo> yeah i feel like more redundancy is key because shit breaks soooo often
[2022-12-08 17:43:53] <+Lavaman94> is it from a lack of people that there is a accident cause they can't properly manage the facilities
[2022-12-08 17:43:55] <+Lavaman94> ?

[2022-12-08 17:44:19] <imNoxel> Surely there's a reason for the massive amount of accidents, right? Is it because there's not enough workers?

[2022-12-08 17:44:40] <Aladire87> Yeah, this game does not have freedom like other builders. If you do not research and explore in the right way at the start, you will run into an issue.
[2022-12-08 17:44:42] <D4RKST0RM99> ooh, getting industries of titan vibes
[2022-12-08 17:44:45] <%+DecoyOcelot> what i learned in my first lose: screw early requests from people. the trust is so high the hit doesnt matter. just build infrastructure instead
[2022-12-08 17:44:50] <Jhreks> they said they were going to put a patch today for accidents i think
[2022-12-08 17:44:56] <ba_nanananananana> can you space them?
[2022-12-08 17:44:58] <eucoco> can you train non workers to workers?

[2022-12-08 18:00:10] <+ForceBan> you need more workers

[2022-12-08 18:00:12] <+Luxen77> yeah it was the administrator that was wrong Kappa

[2022-12-08 18:00:31] <%+DecoyOcelot> this game just needs child labor KEKW

[2022-12-08 18:01:51] <%+DecoyOcelot> people are stupid. space travel doesnt change that
[2022-12-08 18:01:52] <+Drobotic> Build a 2nd one
[2022-12-08 18:01:54] <Jummit> sounds very realistic honestly

[2022-12-08 18:01:55] <+gutter54> i saw some of the steam reviews are about the explosion stuff happens way too often

[2022-12-08 18:02:45] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle what i dont get is why wouldnt you just fucking vent the ppl literally blowing up the thing keeping everyone alive
[2022-12-08 18:02:48] <+ForceBan> you missed some stuff in sol
[2022-12-08 18:03:11] <%+Gh3ttoboy> @sentinel1_9 but then you will get vented faster

[2022-12-08 18:03:38] <Nutteria> As far as I can tell its a loose more game, meaning you need to have always surplus to ensure you never spiral down
[2022-12-08 18:03:40] <@%ninopanda> @Giantwaffle also changed the text to be more festive as well!!!
[2022-12-08 18:03:41] <MadeByTheCommunity> Yea its a tough game! I hope in the future they make a more casual mode
[2022-12-08 18:03:43] <+CorSPACE> can turn off the tutorials
[2022-12-08 18:03:46] <Lord_Epsilon> A restart? I see I join at a propitious time

[2022-12-08 18:03:50] <+Sentinel1_9> @JaydeeCoding fuck that prisoners dont do shit and take food which theyre severely lacking as good
[2022-12-08 18:03:52] <%+TCaillet> less better organized sectors is also better

[2022-12-08 18:04:49] <+PrettyGuyInASuit> @Giantwaffle i actually think key to winning is to have always food on maximum capacity- Food is the most important resource, then just wake up all the cryos all the time. once you hit 2nd level of food production yiuz will be fine

[2022-12-08 18:17:01] <Obalagee> is this a new start?
[2022-12-08 18:17:02] <LeWoodie> need airlock
[2022-12-08 18:17:06] <LeWoodie> KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:17:14] <%DX_Plates> All the wasted space... Its a space station, gotta micro that efficiency.
[2022-12-08 18:17:17] <TibuCoder> But it seems it's exactly the kind of game where first few fails just tell you about the crap the game is throwing at you later, so you'll know to prepare.
[2022-12-08 18:17:20] <%praxiz> i thought anno 1800 was coming out on steam today
[2022-12-08 18:17:22] <@%BarryCarlyon> What do we think on this one waffle does it have promise. Is it worth picking up?
[2022-12-08 18:17:43] <@%BarryCarlyon> @markuselaia I thought you meant a "sub version" of the game
[2022-12-08 18:17:51] <%praxiz> @BarryCarlyon : all the negative reviews on steam are due to balancing.

[2022-12-08 18:17:58] <+KoalaCorgi> you're not alone on that
[2022-12-08 18:18:00] <@%BarryCarlyon> kinda seems like dyson sphere program but without the mech?
[2022-12-08 18:18:03] <%praxiz> people rioting and bombing things then complaining that the things they bombed are gone
[2022-12-08 18:18:03] <%+Gh3ttoboy> @obalagee it is look in the bottem left theres only 1 sector unlocked
[2022-12-08 18:18:06] <%GFQPR1882> @ninopanda Y was it all broke or u just changing them to new ones ?
[2022-12-08 18:18:08] <%+omegaura> streamer brain not wrinkly enough.
[2022-12-08 18:18:11] <Heisuisui> the story seems very compelling
[2022-12-08 18:18:18] <MilkBuds22> It's rough. Failure cascades too quickly
[2022-12-08 18:18:18] <LeWoodie> you cant progress without sicence ship btw
[2022-12-08 18:18:19] <@%BarryCarlyon> @praxiz is it "released" or EA?
[2022-12-08 18:18:22] <Obalagee> @Gh3ttoboy Ahh good point! :)
[2022-12-08 18:18:22] <@%ninopanda> waffleSPINFASTER Ho Ho Ho
[2022-12-08 18:18:27] <Romppaine> @Giantwaffle any idea about replayability? are there more scenarios?
[2022-12-08 18:18:28] <%+LegacyOfPain> Released, not EA
[2022-12-08 18:18:34] <@%BarryCarlyon> gotcha.
[2022-12-08 18:18:34] <%GohandasMandi> Reading the patch notes in their discord it feels like this run'll be a lot better
[2022-12-08 18:18:36] <CtrlShiftR> maybe overengineer everything?
[2022-12-08 18:18:41] <+PresidentHanson> that's why it's discounted day one
[2022-12-08 18:18:41] VIEWERS: 3¬†079
[2022-12-08 18:18:56] <+CorSPACE> i hope there is or they add a freeplay
[2022-12-08 18:18:58] <@%BarryCarlyon> I'm milkdly miffed someone went and decimated the IGDB record for the game from '83 and someone on IGDB staff accepted it and now things are a mess. But I digres.

[2022-12-08 18:19:04] <+exitious> power down storage that is full when you have multiple full storage, treat it as cold storage and only power it up when you need resources
[2022-12-08 18:19:12] <%+Skynotik> You cant build under the sign btw
[2022-12-08 18:19:13] <TibuCoder> early second science ship could be pretty helpful for sure.
[2022-12-08 18:19:22] <%+Skynotik> The Airlock I mean
[2022-12-08 18:19:37] <%DX_Plates> What if it does a Spore... And you get to the savior system, then you have to colonize it, and then expand.

[2022-12-08 18:19:41] <+blerg06> getting some real frostpunk vibes
[2022-12-08 18:20:01] <MilkBuds22> It shows their dimensions if you hover in the build menu
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <%GohandasMandi> Could save the space next to it for a 2nd mess hall
[2022-12-08 18:20:18] <%+omegaura> "Yea that administrator keeps making us build and rebuild things in different places. How weird "
[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <TibuCoder> But considering the amount of space you have in the transport ship list and minesr and such, it looks lik you're supposed to scale this up pretty massively.

[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <%+Gh3ttoboy> i would also suggest 2 mess halls just incase they decide to bomb one of them
[2022-12-08 18:20:31] <@%$Apparentthreat> BarryCarlyon wasn't me peepoRun
[2022-12-08 18:20:39] <@%BarryCarlyon> @Apparentthreat suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure
[2022-12-08 18:20:41] VIEWERS: 3¬†079
[2022-12-08 18:20:43] <%GohandasMandi> Definitely not now, probably not until you get your 2nd sector up
[2022-12-08 18:21:02] <@%BarryCarlyon> @Apparentthreat Given the change logs are public....
[2022-12-08 18:21:07] <MrAbzie> does the negative effect of staying in a system carry over when you jump to the next system?

[2022-12-08 18:21:10] <@%$Apparentthreat> BarryCarlyon I did attempt to do stuff w/ CRUMB but even that was a struggle LUL  The damn cover art requirements and then not being able to revert it
[2022-12-08 18:21:12] <%GFQPR1882> Pog
[2022-12-08 18:21:14] <+Scupio> You like the game so far? Thinking about buying it. Love the setting.
[2022-12-08 18:21:15] <%GFQPR1882> waffleLove
[2022-12-08 18:21:25] <@%BarryCarlyon> @Apparentthreat oh thats easy :-D I think I sorted that one out
[2022-12-08 18:21:27] <%Hurtwolf> LuvGift
[2022-12-08 18:21:29] <@%$Apparentthreat> BarryCarlyon  meaning "cover art too small" then the "you MUST HAVE COVER ART"
[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <%+omegaura> @Giantwaffle you could put the lab in front of the sign though.
[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <+exitious> Can you remove the origional docking station and rebuild it elsewhere?
[2022-12-08 18:21:38] <Rozz161> the outer support beam is on the other side of the sign?
[2022-12-08 18:21:44] <%GohandasMandi> I'm guessing below that sign is the only hardpoint for a train between sectors down the line?
[2022-12-08 18:21:44] <@%$Apparentthreat> and not being able to save otherwise
[2022-12-08 18:21:49] <%+LegacyOfPain> @Scupio seems really hard
[2022-12-08 18:21:50] <+F1r3punch> yea hence you wanna build most of your storage stuff against that sign, cause wall space is valuable
[2022-12-08 18:21:52] <%+NoodledPanda> @MasterKraft Thanks dude! Got me to 3years sub
[2022-12-08 18:21:52] <Kollisco> Let's be honest, @Giantwaffle had  a dream about this game last night while he slept. So yes, he likes it :P
[2022-12-08 18:21:54] <@%BarryCarlyon> @Apparentthreat and thats why I'm an IGDB keeper :-P

[2022-12-08 18:22:25] <TibuCoder> The building dead zone is probably not because of the sign, but because of the external structure.

[2022-12-08 18:30:59] <Fooker> Is yardwork part of the HOA fee?
[2022-12-08 18:31:00] <+hyokaa> you have power now
[2022-12-08 18:31:03] <Aladire87> You got the power to turn those back on.

[2022-12-08 18:31:28] <%FL0RENZI> @Giantwaffle will you watch the game awards?
[2022-12-08 18:31:37] <+warcake> does turning the power off to a stockpile lock the resources in there?
[2022-12-08 18:31:45] <%+fukus0da> @FL0RENZI not on stream
[2022-12-08 18:31:48] <%arkun_> so one of the main gripes I heard about Frostpunk is the game railroaded you with scenarios, how comparable is Ixion to that flaw?
[2022-12-08 18:31:57] <%+omegaura> feels like waffle overbuilds at times.
[2022-12-08 18:32:02] <hydoto> Why do we even use solar power should we not have reactors in this station?
[2022-12-08 18:32:11] <skalnor> I love how this game doesn't punish you for deleting or moving buildings
[2022-12-08 18:32:14] <+J1ce> this looks like startopia
[2022-12-08 18:32:20] <+cptmuruais> is the game of this game very hardware demanding?
[2022-12-08 18:32:43] <hydoto> @cptmuruais probably no
[2022-12-08 18:32:44] <gawddamson> Do you need to find all research in space or is there some building that generates that?

[2022-12-08 18:33:12] <hydoto> Best thing to do is research production buildings before jumping
[2022-12-08 18:33:17] <@%$Apparentthreat> @Giantwaffle any interest in revisiting Portal w/ RTX?
[2022-12-08 18:33:39] <%GohandasMandi> By that you mean head to the edge of the system to jump instead of imploding the moon?
[2022-12-08 18:33:42] <+cptmuruais> this game resembles chip pcbs desingn
[2022-12-08 18:34:08] <Aladire87> This looks so much nicer than mine.
[2022-12-08 18:34:14] <Moose__Nipples> so is this like Frostpunk in space?
[2022-12-08 18:34:17] <matteuus337> are thos cars in the lanes?
[2022-12-08 18:34:21] <%+Kaines> 9x9

[2022-12-08 18:35:39] <%+omegaura> @Giantwaffle why rush? if you have food production taken care of no need to leave.
[2022-12-08 18:35:46] <%+deathbytray16> have you destroyed the moon yet ? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-08 18:35:47] <%GohandasMandi> Yeah no reason to leave stuff behind right now since you have no maintenance
[2022-12-08 18:35:48] <Igneous3> do you have to open sections sequentially or could you open sec2 and then go left to open sec6?
[2022-12-08 18:35:55] <macdrai> I feel like you should basically strip down the solar system of every thing if you want to be ready at the next system

[2022-12-08 18:48:34] <Igneous3> so not quite minimum safe distance
[2022-12-08 18:48:35] <$Mongo_Smash> Ummm...  Why is everyone so calm about the fact that we just destroyed the Moon?  Have we don't this before?
[2022-12-08 18:48:38] <+exitious> Do they ever explain exactly why the structure of the ship is literally falling to dust constantly?
[2022-12-08 18:48:43] <+capidtp> didn't they knew this was going to happen?

[2022-12-08 18:48:54] <+ricotez> I don't think we even made it to Proxima Centauri, we jumped into the future instead

[2022-12-08 18:48:59] <hashbringer> Waffle killed us all Pog
[2022-12-08 18:49:00] <hydoto> I'm amazed we did not jump into the moon's debris
[2022-12-08 18:49:01] <INeverWon> PepoThink
[2022-12-08 18:49:02] <+SugarGliderDude> are we the baddies?
[2022-12-08 18:49:03] <coloradostrong> so us in the next 50 years got it
[2022-12-08 18:49:03] <The_Holas> mby it was all planned monkaS
[2022-12-08 18:49:08] <JaydeeCoding> @FlokyKnight The jump grabed part of the moon with the ship
[2022-12-08 18:49:09] <%humanshjake> But you found earth?
[2022-12-08 18:49:10] <Aladire87> Well, in the animation, you flew through a blackhole... So, not surprised you went into the future.
[2022-12-08 18:49:10] <JessUniverse> So this is what happened in interstellara
[2022-12-08 18:49:11] <%+TCaillet> send the probe
[2022-12-08 18:49:18] <%GohandasMandi> Seems like the intense gravity just ripped the moon in half
[2022-12-08 18:49:18] <BlackholeYeti> similar vibes to the beginning of homeworld, love it
[2022-12-08 18:49:20] <%+omegaura> Cause jumping near the moon was smart. KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:49:22] <PureSpider> @JessUniverse yea, basically, same concept
[2022-12-08 18:49:23] <%FlokyKnight> so where are we now
[2022-12-08 18:49:24] <%anx_gotta> A part of the moon was in the sphere of influence of the engine and it was transported with the ship.
[2022-12-08 18:49:25] <+Hemry64_> We just wanted a piece of home
[2022-12-08 18:49:25] <+CorSPACE> maybe grabbing the moon increase our gravity or something and that caused the timet ravel? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-08 18:49:25] <DarkbuilderX> We assumed it would only grab the ship, turns out it has a pretty big radius
[2022-12-08 18:49:26] <matteuus337> pretty cool game
[2022-12-08 18:49:28] <+Sentinel1_9> its like a gravity drive basically
[2022-12-08 18:49:32] <Blitzonite> this is nothing like what happened in interstellar chat
[2022-12-08 18:49:35] <%+Llyin_> so its like a gravaton engine that  creates a localilized field and broke the solar system
[2022-12-08 18:49:37] <+jmm548> prolly the fired grenerated for the jump was bigger then they planned
[2022-12-08 18:49:40] <%+Apakawata> It tore the time/space constant
[2022-12-08 18:49:41] <%Smithii> The diagnostics speak of weird data in the protocol... sounds like it might have been hacked
[2022-12-08 18:49:43] <+jmm548> field*
[2022-12-08 18:49:43] <+capidtp> but you could see the continents on earth, is it devoid of life or just devastated to some degree?
[2022-12-08 18:49:44] <JaydeeCoding> @FlokyKnight Same spot we started but in a different timeline
[2022-12-08 18:49:45] <%FlokyKnight> Where are we?
[2022-12-08 18:49:48] <+ricotez> it's really cool how the game pretends it's just going to be a colonization/space exploration game, it does a great job hiding the plot twist
[2022-12-08 18:49:50] <%+TCaillet> earth dead, rip
[2022-12-08 18:49:58] <%+Llyin_> oh
[2022-12-08 18:50:02] <Turstlye> They did the math wrong
[2022-12-08 18:50:04] <@%+Invalidm_> @humanshjake because on our way back we were essentially sent to the same place we left which earth was still there. cause plot.
[2022-12-08 18:50:04] <%FlokyKnight> @JaydeeCoding, ohhh I get it now, so we came back to earth and its dead?
[2022-12-08 18:50:06] <%$Tabakhase> a sloppy copy-paste job
[2022-12-08 18:50:09] <Speedglass> sun went super nova and fried the EM

[2022-12-08 18:50:13] <PureSpider> imagine universes like 3D slices in a 4D space, the vohle engine moves through that 4D space
[2022-12-08 18:50:14] <JaydeeCoding> @FlokyKnight yea

[2022-12-08 18:50:30] <+CorSPACE> i think gravity waves are faster than light
[2022-12-08 18:50:32] <Aphatys_> ofc they never tested the engine, its not like u need to test something new to see if and how it works before using in a real world scenario 4Head
[2022-12-08 18:50:32] <Aladire87> All options do the same
[2022-12-08 18:50:35] <%+monosmly> "Vhole", maybe a artificial wormhole

[2022-12-08 18:50:45] <+xetremwow> is this game worth the 30 ‚Ç¨?

[2022-12-08 19:12:15] <+Sentinel1_9> should rush the wall housing tbh
[2022-12-08 19:12:18] <Aladire87> You could move the road up for that one spot at the bottom after moving storage.

[2022-12-08 19:22:18] <%Dagmoo> my one question about this game is replayability. is there really any?

[2022-12-08 19:22:52] <%GohandasMandi> It's a narrative game, so inherently doubt theres replayability

[2022-12-08 19:25:36] <Aladire87> I dont think you got it free, but that you unlocked it.
[2022-12-08 19:25:37] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle i also feel it shouldnt damage consistently for each jump if theyre reducing the cap for each jump
[2022-12-08 19:25:46] <marvelo> Thats avoided by micro managing working conditions to keep it at optimal conditions tbh
[2022-12-08 19:25:48] <pr3datorija> its hiden science

[2022-12-08 20:26:40] <+PossiblyDangerus> No, I just researched them. They are twice
[2022-12-08 20:26:41] <+ryyuka242> you get a new building that holds 40
[2022-12-08 20:26:43] <Slymph> This is the result of reading YEP
[2022-12-08 20:26:44] <CrackingBones> kleanSip
[2022-12-08 20:26:49] <+ryyuka242> but its 3x6
[2022-12-08 20:26:59] <+PossiblyDangerus> so instead of 30, it's 40 for the same size
[2022-12-08 20:26:59] <%+DecoyOcelot> thats gotta be a new building
[2022-12-08 20:27:03] <+orillion> @Slymph imagine reading in a videogame YEP
[2022-12-08 20:27:04] <%+Skynotik> Cell Housing is 3x6 so its 2 times not 3 timies
[2022-12-08 20:27:09] <skalnor> But thats cell housing unupgraded
[2022-12-08 20:27:14] <%Helo_KiX> I think they're saying if you upgrade its not the same size
[2022-12-08 20:27:14] <Tamerlain> so more population

[2022-12-08 20:27:19] <+PossiblyDangerus> It's a new building.
[2022-12-08 20:27:24] <%+stadius3737> its 3x6, i got it on my playthrough
[2022-12-08 20:27:30] <%+stadius3737> its just a 33% increase
[2022-12-08 20:27:31] <%+DecoyOcelot> i thnk thats like 'medium storage' that gives you a bigger storage building
[2022-12-08 20:27:33] <Slymph> @orillion Imagine imagining 5Head
[2022-12-08 20:27:35] <Aladire87> Be careful about population. Mess halls at the start can only feed 500 people at a time.
[2022-12-08 20:27:46] <+PossiblyDangerus> It's still really good!
[2022-12-08 20:27:48] <pr3datorija> 10 nore people
[2022-12-08 20:27:50] <+warcake> 40 vs 30 for same footprint
[2022-12-08 20:27:57] <+ryyuka242> you only get 10 people more because you loose 2 of the mormal houses to build one of those
[2022-12-08 20:28:13] <%+TCaillet> still really good
[2022-12-08 20:28:31] <CptB0b> maybe the construction cost stays the same while housing more warranting it being an upgrade?

[2022-12-08 20:47:44] <+unverifiedbread> Sr-71 came from the A-12 design
[2022-12-08 20:47:45] <@%+Nexhunter> the foxhound was developed to intercept that shit
[2022-12-08 20:47:58] <+fc2steveo> a12 was the base for the new model sr71
[2022-12-08 20:48:00] <+dew1ttew0lff> U2 was angel, a12 was archangel
[2022-12-08 20:48:01] <%+Jaded_Parrot> i think it was more the altitude as well than the speed
[2022-12-08 20:48:03] <@%+Nexhunter> which is why it weird for the Mig31 to be added without supersonic bombers Susge

[2022-12-08 20:48:11] <+StrangledShriek> I actually sat in an SR-71 before they sealed it up for display on base.
[2022-12-08 20:48:19] <dennixfailalot> back then the cia had some cool designs
[2022-12-08 20:48:32] <KabuLKurt> they couldn t keep up, check out the Book, Video "Sled Driver"
[2022-12-08 20:48:41] <macdrai> The SR-71 was constantly leaking on the tarmac, the fuselage was mostly titanium and was only tight when it was running at mach speed
[2022-12-08 20:48:42] <@%+Nexhunter> the real Beauty of that era is the B1 lancer NODDERS

[2022-12-08 23:26:02] <+Gashlex> would it be worth it to move a few insect farms just to get specialization for efficiency?
