[2023-01-05 18:14:49] <%+Qball_Gam1ng> Never heard of any of these animes. Are they any good?
[2023-01-05 18:14:50] <!%ZiBookishGamer> not even the Sailor Moon theme, which is probably the most recognizable
[2023-01-05 18:14:52] <%Cronofuge> Its solid
[2023-01-05 18:14:55] <NovaKona> I prefer the manga
[2023-01-05 18:14:55] <%Dandyfloss> this was my favourite OP
[2023-01-05 18:14:55] <%Temporal_Paradox> There are worse anime

[2023-01-05 18:14:59] <$Kusanagi2k5> MHA is pretty decent
[2023-01-05 18:15:00] <@%arcanumghost> that song is such an eclectic banger. It has like 5 tonal shifts

[2023-01-05 19:32:44] <%JayBusch> @drawing_daemon There‚Äôs a different warp we‚Äôre trying to get
[2023-01-05 19:32:45] <%$MaxDOutEX> You'd probably find it easier if you get hit and become small again, but you can do it by crouch jumping
[2023-01-05 19:32:50] <RedOniVA> Isn't there another warp to World 5 anyway?
[2023-01-05 19:32:51] <insaneintentionsyo> phrasing
[2023-01-05 19:32:53] <%+Yggy_Ch> I BELEAF
[2023-01-05 19:32:58] <+Enygmus> you can do it
[2023-01-05 19:32:59] <%higadoyrinon> LUL LUL
[2023-01-05 19:33:12] <kirbyfighter12> henlo.
[2023-01-05 19:33:12] <%TalkingObject> You can remind even further
[2023-01-05 19:33:18] <FleaFlickr> why u guys giving her speedrun strats lmao
[2023-01-05 19:33:20] <zenozip> NO
[2023-01-05 19:33:23] <zenozip> Y U DO DAT
[2023-01-05 19:33:23] <!%AirahsELL> you can just die and restart the level you know
[2023-01-05 19:33:26] <%Rarefoil> I think you can figure out the rest
[2023-01-05 19:33:32] <DRAWING_DAEMON> boing
[2023-01-05 19:33:38] <!%Catbag> let her cook
[2023-01-05 19:33:39] <%TalkingObject> I think it's best just to beat the level
[2023-01-05 19:33:43] <zenozip> you don't show those blocks
[2023-01-05 19:33:43] <%+PedroYuuhi> This one is hard but possible
[2023-01-05 19:33:45] <%Temporal_Paradox> lol
[2023-01-05 19:33:46] <%+Yggy_Ch> it's tight but I think you can squeeze in
[2023-01-05 19:33:52] <%vaarikaorg> We bgelive in you!

[2023-01-05 19:34:07] <RedOniVA> I think Oli wants to get the warp, but we should let her play how she wants

[2023-01-05 19:34:12] <%Carkistador> dont let go of down
[2023-01-05 19:34:17] <%BubbleRoxie> It's best not to reveal the highest one so you don't have to squeeze
[2023-01-05 19:34:25] <@%$BlackCharcz> or just get hit to be smaller again
[2023-01-05 19:34:27] <zenozip> XD BOOO JUST PLAY THE LEVEL HAHA
[2023-01-05 19:34:31] <RedOniVA> Just warp to World 6 instead
