[2022-12-22 00:17:07] <@%Ring> that's a shame
[2022-12-22 00:17:17] <+pepperepper> i don't think it does nothing, its just less impactful
[2022-12-22 00:17:21] <+PapaJonesy> is it a certain perk or bow that lets fighters use them
[2022-12-22 00:17:24] <Surreal_Okay> oh gotcha nw
[2022-12-22 00:17:27] <@%Ring> ah ok
[2022-12-22 00:17:28] <+sltenoo> What does moot mean in this context?
[2022-12-22 00:17:43] <+pepperepper> i think 5 physical power = 5 percent more damage, could be good if you already have aton
[2022-12-22 00:17:50] <Keman24> Would barbarian benefit from physical power? Or it just scales bad in general?
[2022-12-22 00:18:16] <%+BarelyABearr> @sltenoo I think he means that the stats do not actually benefit or are in effect
[2022-12-22 00:18:19] <+sltenoo> Already used it on NL kleanTeef
[2022-12-22 00:18:20] <+Sam_Hall_> @pepperepper it's not sadly if you look at the stat changes

[2022-12-22 00:23:21] <JonahVeil> yup
[2022-12-22 00:23:28] <JonahVeil> Traps, longbow, sustain. Ranger def the play
[2022-12-22 00:23:31] <+pepperepper> or maybe im biased just because they fire more often at you than melee classes hit you
[2022-12-22 00:23:33] <cancerous_reply> imagine this game but elden ring type combat

[2022-12-22 00:24:51] <JonahVeil> But then its who makes the first move.
[2022-12-22 00:24:59] <+pepperepper> when i'm playing fighter, my strategy is to just sprint straight to the power buffs, makes fighter feel insane

[2022-12-22 00:25:18] <%+cid380> That why you run the Crossbow on the fighter? comp for the 20%

[2022-12-22 00:25:58] <Xitrozop> @klean Tanky Knight with high dmg barbarian and cleric is meta team
[2022-12-22 00:25:59] <cancerous_reply> These types of games never "release" its a new format of ongoing development. Fortnite, Dayz, tarkov, star citizen, fall guys, path of exile, many more, these things never "release"
[2022-12-22 00:26:09] <%Splint671> How longs the play test?
[2022-12-22 00:26:17] <JonahVeil> this game releases next year.
[2022-12-22 00:26:28] <JonahVeil> I think there is no point in discussing a meta, its so gear heavy lol
[2022-12-22 00:26:48] <%+cid380> I will say the mage dagger spec is pretty op, but then again it's more like everything has a few OP specs
[2022-12-22 00:26:49] <JonahVeil> I was doing 100 with a zap when I was juiced , its out of control.

[2022-12-22 00:44:05] <@Madoc_BM> the advantage of one hand is you can also use a shield
[2022-12-22 00:44:06] <%+BarelyABearr> @RaiderK707 To use the item you need to have it selected and then RMB to start it

[2022-12-22 03:16:01] <Arod529> 77dimes They are basically hollow points, so better against soft targets but less hard material penetration. The plastic tip allows it to retain near fmj aerodynamics.
[2022-12-22 03:16:05] <%+RedlightsTV> so the tips destroy themselfs on impact do less penetration after initial hit?

[2022-12-22 03:17:33] <%+SniTchN> @RedlightsTV they are there to maintain aerodynamics but have very little effect on impact. they fill the hollow point which expands in the target. V-max is a Hornaday hunting round

[2022-12-22 19:17:05] <+BluBerry62> very cool. I see it as a building block to more graphically complex games, I think thats what would drive people away from it
[2022-12-22 19:17:19] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> the game is basically the best version of battlefield/squad gameplay
[2022-12-22 19:17:56] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> the environmental destruction is also amazing

[2022-12-22 19:18:24] <cancerous_reply> @Chimerical_Eclipse squad is slower, more tactical, and is made to make you feel a small unit in a big battlefield, this is more shooterish, faster, they arent the same
[2022-12-22 19:18:37] <+yungboihari> i love this game so much

[2022-12-22 19:20:37] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> i do wish they would add a bit more shading to the environmental textures, some of the interiors look way too blank

[2022-12-22 19:21:34] <cancerous_reply> Ive suggested baking in AO to the textures, if they bake it in its not expensive, not engine AO, and makes easier for brain to identify depth

[2022-12-22 20:00:49] <siddo__> my only complaint with this game so far is having to start with iron sights on every smg and rifle
[2022-12-22 20:01:06] <siddo__> especially because muzzleflash its so hard to see through most irons
[2022-12-22 20:01:19] <Vinny2Goddi> I wish more people would be team players like @Klean
[2022-12-22 20:01:37] <Ratedxv> Yea I mean isnt it only like 5 kills to get a sight its not that bad

[2022-12-22 20:02:01] <siddo__> @Ratedxv yeah its only 10 but if its that little why even have it at all, just makes those first few kills a bit more annoying

[2022-12-22 20:03:08] <Ratedxv> @Ratedxv Yea I get what your saying I mean I like the game because it has progression and sadly better than battlefield lol
[2022-12-22 20:03:17] <+TiddleTits> factual stream title, no cap
[2022-12-22 20:03:59] <siddo__> @Ratedxv oh yeah dont get me wrong, i love the rest of the progression, just hate trying out a new gun and having to get those first few kills. especially the mp5 was terrible to use because of the muzzleflash

[2022-12-22 20:10:50] <siddo__> yeah i personally dont like scope glint, or atleast it shouldnt be shown from everywhere, maybe like a 10 degree cone from the scope
[2022-12-22 20:11:13] <%+ooloafobutter> @ikonicgaming_ an from a business aspect thats not enough wiggle room to launch the game. they need at least two months

[2022-12-22 20:11:52] <siddo__> nothing wrong with asking

[2022-12-22 22:24:49] <+smalld_bigdreams> I know it's not related to Dark & Darker, but have you heard/checked out a game called Zero Sievert? It's a 2d top down pixel shooter that's similar to stalker or eft. You can see a lot of the inspiration from those games. I think you'd like it
[2022-12-22 22:24:55] <%zohanmute> yea chris hemsworth show limitless goes into how beneficial cold training is

[2022-12-22 22:27:42] <Izenn__> Btw I'm playing alone which class would be best to be able to actually do something alone ?
[2022-12-22 22:28:06] <TheGobblerr> @Izenn__ im guessing rouge

[2022-12-22 22:28:45] <CatEatingMushrooms> @Rorviticus They plan for every DnD class. They already have concept art for a few, like Bard, and I think Druid and Artificer.

[2022-12-22 22:30:41] <Izenn__> I've tried Ranger and Cleric, cleric is a bit annoying it takes ages to buff yourself but it lasts for 30 seconds max so I dunno Ranger is what i like most at the moment but i'll try wizard i think it can be fun as well
[2022-12-22 22:31:00] <cokedrips69> so the fighter can use bow and sword....any input on what a good class would be for a noob
[2022-12-22 22:31:00] VIEWERS: 843
[2022-12-22 22:31:40] <CatEatingMushrooms> Good players often say Cleric for solo. Most people have the hardest time dealing with good Wizards; cause they just can't get to them; so if you play that well you can 1v3 fairly consistently.
[2022-12-22 22:31:45] <@%SamuraiSavv> @cokedrips69 Not all bows

[2022-12-22 23:14:32] <+Overcast22> its should just give you a fraction of the loot worth like 25% more similar to IRL insurance. if i crash my car and claim it i dont get my car back i get money to get a similar one. @Klean
