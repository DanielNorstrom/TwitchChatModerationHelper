[2022-12-09 00:07:55] <@%^y0shi_b0t> RinkRB is trying to gather a team of Master Thieves for the Thieves Guild heist on the Bank of Cyrodiil! To aid in this quest join by typing "!heist <betting amount>" in chat. The more thieves who join the bigger the chance of success! (Max amount: 9999)
[2022-12-09 00:09:55] <@%^y0shi_b0t> Ready your bows and sheath your daggers, the time has come for the heist to begin!
[2022-12-09 00:09:58] <@%^y0shi_b0t> RinkRB was instantly detected by an Imperial Guard. After taking an arrow to the knee you were thrown into the Imperial Prison to spend the remaining years of your life.
[2022-12-09 00:49:55] <@%^y0shi_b0t> The beggar spies just informed us that the Imperial guards seem to have lowered their security. Now would be a perfect time for the Thieves Guild to strike! Type "!heist <betting amount>.

[2022-12-09 15:22:22] <enricoboss21> Elden Ring GOTY  PogChamp
[2022-12-09 15:22:22] <%brianthebroken85> Ragnarok should have been for next year so it could have been GOTY then. But at least Ragnarok took the most awards, while ER won GOTY, so at least both games were honoured.
[2022-12-09 15:22:22] <%dangerousfella> It‚Äôs going to be really good! It‚Äôs been 10 years since the first space marine game mikkaaDamn

[2022-12-09 15:25:16] <%FernoFry> Kid just wanted to ask when the DLC was coming out
[2022-12-09 15:25:16] <denonto_> It makes tones of sense, I agree with you

[2022-12-09 15:28:47] <%itsCobbi> I honestly think Horizon was having a hard time and got REALLY unlucky because it was such a STRONG line up and Horizon 2 is definitely an incredible game!
[2022-12-09 15:28:47] <writer_thirteen> stray is not a game, it's a cat walking sim
[2022-12-09 15:28:53] <@%Radolov> Oh forgot @CasualEmma mikkaaPaws mikkaaPats mikkaaWave
[2022-12-09 15:28:56] <TrueTJP> I was a little sad that GOW didn't win GOTY, was like watching my favorite football team lose a match :( but Elden Ring deffo deserves it

[2022-12-09 15:50:33] <+j0hnnyflve> I think the music of ER is way better than GoW

[2022-12-09 15:50:51] <%Thydus_76> The opening theme on the start screen is superior to everything in ragnarok sorry not sorry KEKW

[2022-12-09 15:50:58] <+fungineeer> people actually thought GoW could win
[2022-12-09 15:51:00] <+shaqgrizz> Loved GoW music Elden Ring should have definitely won the award
[2022-12-09 15:51:00] <wehtboi> GOWR deserved all the awards
[2022-12-09 15:51:03] <%Asbjoooorn> God of wars music was amazing though. The final song at the credits had me in tears
[2022-12-09 15:51:09] <%a__girl_has_no_name> Elden ring should have won that one. Last of us I should have won the accessibility one for literally making their game playable for BLIND PEOPLE.
[2022-12-09 15:51:09] <%HarmonicArcade> Overall I think ER had better music but I liked a lot of Ragnaroks music too so I‚Äôm conflicted
[2022-12-09 15:51:09] <%+BibsLegacyy> I was disappointed elden rings music I thought was the best in any game I played
