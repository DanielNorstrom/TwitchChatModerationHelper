[2022-12-30 16:58:23] <+riltro> Like the guy who said higher crits, but you will also average hit more low crits too

[2022-12-30 17:00:07] <RsVasco> u need eggnog ring for that to be bis yh
[2022-12-30 17:00:17] <mariqlol> also if you get tier helm
[2022-12-30 17:00:19] <mariqlol> that would feeel bad too
[2022-12-30 17:00:25] <%Schertle> if you dont have ring its not worth
[2022-12-30 17:00:27] <RsVasco> I crafted an off hand dagger with emblish before i get the ring
[2022-12-30 17:00:28] <+Drjacobi_> if you have titan matrix u can craft 382 helmet
[2022-12-30 17:00:31] <+threeminute> Lariat and weapon
[2022-12-30 17:00:48] <RsVasco> helmet not worth before u get the ring
[2022-12-30 17:00:51] <+x_IHamiltoN> the cowl is good aslong as you have the raid ring
[2022-12-30 17:00:54] <nuya64> what is stat for outlaw m+
[2022-12-30 17:00:57] <sarug> @GingiTV the helmet is 3 yard range so keep that in range
[2022-12-30 17:00:57] <GameChampTCG> its a lot
[2022-12-30 17:01:00] <+x_IHamiltoN> otherwise it doesnt sim that high
[2022-12-30 17:01:01] <%delmaszm> head only good if you have ring
[2022-12-30 17:01:08] <Badsler> thats why you use it
[2022-12-30 17:01:09] <RsVasco> @nuya64 crit > vers
[2022-12-30 17:01:11] <sarug> @GingiTV helmet is 3 yard range you have to play around it alot
[2022-12-30 17:01:14] <mariqlol> Yee
[2022-12-30 17:01:19] <GameChampTCG> ramfam has 424 tier helm he is replacing because cowl is that much better
[2022-12-30 17:01:23] <RsVasco> yes. helm only with ring
[2022-12-30 17:01:31] <boiben_> Did you openned your vautl?
