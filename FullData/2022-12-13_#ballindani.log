[2022-12-13 17:06:03] <%$dankpips45> I never liked his energy and vibes. Now I'm so so glad I stayed away.
[2022-12-13 17:06:04] <%FATALHERMIT> he can try with the lawsuits but they'll lead nowhere

[2022-12-13 17:07:34] <%FATALHERMIT> you can try but they wont be able to prove a malicious intent

[2022-12-13 17:16:17] <@%caveman_ow> He said some pretty shitty stuff a while back
[2022-12-13 17:16:32] VIEWERS: 34
[2022-12-13 17:16:32] <%FATALHERMIT> he got cancelled at some point but i dont recall why
[2022-12-13 17:16:51] <@%caveman_ow> But he did apologize and hasn't said stuff like that since
[2022-12-13 17:17:04] <@MusicalGlaceon> oh cool
[2022-12-13 17:17:08] <@%caveman_ow> He defended Sinatra and said some pretty misogynistic things
[2022-12-13 17:17:50] <%$dankpips45> He was doing a buch of edgey shit, supporting misogyny and did a "troll movement" calling it the Isis of Overwatch. It was not good. But from what I can see he's really trying his best to reform. Might be wrong.
[2022-12-13 17:18:21] <%FATALHERMIT> his chats are absolute pepegas

[2022-12-13 17:18:35] <%$dankpips45> a lot of this stuff was years ago and he doesn't seem to be doing any toxic stuff anymore.
[2022-12-13 17:18:42] <%FATALHERMIT> though they might have changed since his reformation
[2022-12-13 17:18:45] <@%caveman_ow> I don't really follow him much but apparently he's grown
