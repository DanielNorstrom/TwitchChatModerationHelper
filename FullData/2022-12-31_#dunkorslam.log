[2022-12-31 07:16:19] <%lols_royce> it can also cause emotional damage to the user

[2022-12-31 07:50:40] <BroShock_> @lingt03 It means the base wand doesn't have the mana to cast the spell. He's making up for it with all the increase manas though

[2022-12-31 07:50:42] <%VirtualButt_> @lingt03 it means the wand does not have enough mana to cast that spell

[2022-12-31 07:50:53] <%+Crypt1c_squid> @dunkorslam could you turn the run timer on so people just tuning in can know how long you've been going for?
[2022-12-31 07:50:55] <scarlac> @lingt03 It means it *thinks* he doesn't have enough mana but the 'add manage' spell fixes that
[2022-12-31 07:50:58] <peterce3> @lingt03 The wand does not have enough max mana to cast the spell does not matter right now because we have add mana
[2022-12-31 07:51:03] <GILF69> @lingt03 the wand is a VERY low mana wand, you'll get that symbol if the specific spell costs too much mana for that spell
[2022-12-31 07:51:06] <%podushhka> guys i think he got it
[2022-12-31 07:51:06] <%redtens> @lingt03 so that wand can't support those spells, but he has 'add mana' modifiers which circumvent those limitations

[2022-12-31 09:29:11] <%$Softlump> im pretty sure the issue with cloud save is the huge amount of small files in noita saves.

[2022-12-31 09:29:11] <%SectionTIC> Maybe compress the folder too? 7zip or rar? Seems like those files would have a lot of 'air' in them.

[2022-12-31 10:28:17] <%+lawthahost> you would just be able to constantly rain chests from spawn chests LuL
[2022-12-31 10:28:17] <%+teh60> @DunkOrSlam you could also do the HM collapse pacifist chest method to farm the kuu if u dont get it during all these PW's
[2022-12-31 10:28:24] <%SectionTIC> It's all good. Processed foods have a shitton of preservatives in them. Mummified from the inside out. NODDERS
[2022-12-31 10:28:24] <%brbrmensch> @DunkOrSlam probably because it would be recursive every time since they drops on top of altar

[2022-12-31 10:28:39] <fishjinkies> maybe its because a chest rain would trigger another chest rain automatically since they would land on the floating island

[2022-12-31 10:46:25] <%+teh60> @RoyalJamMix when u drop the reroll machine away from the HM zone u can pickup the perks without the machine losing its pricetag, and to break reroll machines u need pricetags to click and force number higher with
[2022-12-31 10:46:27] <ArthurAshford> THERE IS A BLUE TRIGGER!
[2022-12-31 10:46:28] <Angourimon> you missed a heart  3Head (yes i know hearts are not needed at this point, bite me)

[2022-12-31 10:47:04] <%q_z__> @DeepFriedNutzz it was thrown by a potion thrower. Potion throwers throw 200% filled potions
[2022-12-31 10:47:05] <%+teh60> @DeepFriedNutzz thats a normal teleportatium flask from a flask thrower, chase got a flask of unstable tele

[2022-12-31 10:47:27] <%DarthJawa5> It's only 130% filled

[2022-12-31 10:47:44] <%xurxo__> couldnt you use the revive guy to get infinite poly immunity if you get a poly mage near him and eat the corpse a bit each time? @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-31 10:47:45] <%Letaali> they have the same amount of liquid, but the capacity of the flask is halved to 500
[2022-12-31 10:47:55] <%Letaali> so 1000/500 = 200%

[2022-12-31 10:59:01] <+acemagex> @tiberius3696 breaking it once is way more than enough, bc it gives you an absurd number of free rerolls before it 'fixes' itself. If it does, I don't think it's realistically possible to break it again, bc the price is way too high when it fixes itself.

[2022-12-31 12:14:11] <+Drunkenshoe> Should be able to get more silver in an empty pouch with tele kick. It lets you hold the pouch further out from you, no?
[2022-12-31 12:14:11] <%WUOTE> Yeah kinda
[2022-12-31 12:14:21] <%Letaali> you would do it elsewhere and throw a pouch into it
[2022-12-31 12:14:22] <%zergextrem> if this run will go for another 11 hours and 40min then it will be new years eve here in Germany

[2022-12-31 13:21:30] <JustNukeIt_> Does Crit on water works without water in the world?
[2022-12-31 13:21:45] <%Letaali> yep
[2022-12-31 13:21:46] <boogerpolice> I guess the title says it
[2022-12-31 13:22:01] <%Letaali> water trail and water spell can apply wet for crit to still work
[2022-12-31 13:22:02] <%MoroseMonkey> Why do we even need a kuu? Isn't the music stone good enough for the sun quest?

[2022-12-31 13:24:32] <+iLordEx> im using it on the hand statue, but after hitting it so many times wiht homebringer it stopped working
[2022-12-31 13:24:35] <+reerotrains> @WUOTE i did the quest a month ago and i only used homebringer
[2022-12-31 13:24:44] <+iLordEx> normally telekenetic kick activates the guy that spawns from it
[2022-12-31 13:25:03] <%WUOTE> ok then i was wrong @reerotrains thanks for confirmgation

[2022-12-31 13:29:31] <%Nifty255> 99% of the mechanics of Noita come not from the data and variables, but instead how they interact. Noita is hyper-distilled emergent gameplay.
[2022-12-31 13:29:35] <%Sunforest> The ideal bridge boss cheese is required to solve the eye puzzle.

[2022-12-31 13:30:42] <KlockoArt> @Wulwar keep in mind noita is pretty challenging and it has a very steep learning curve. completely expect the first couple dozen hours to kinda be brutal

[2022-12-31 13:42:46] <%+xMyPetCactusx> would it not be worth to shift away poly via holding a polymorph flask?
[2022-12-31 13:43:11] <th3grimm1997> i was gonna say why not just shift it somewhere else

[2022-12-31 13:43:21] <%Capta1nK1ng> for your 1700th win you should do all steam achievements in one run
[2022-12-31 13:43:27] <One_Who_Walks_Silly> second shift is silver to flask sooooo
[2022-12-31 13:43:32] <%+xMyPetCactusx> @Drunkenshoe right, hence holding the poly flask so it would shift the poly

[2022-12-31 15:05:13] <%Letaali> it's closer to 9.5% per, and due to rng in noita, if the seed doesn't like spawning it, the results can be way under 9.5% if you look at all parallels

[2022-12-31 16:18:24] <%BSNamikaze90> hello, good morning sir.
[2022-12-31 16:18:25] <%s3xygirl6969> it use coordinates because random doesn't exist
[2022-12-31 16:18:29] <%myndzi> @Bohnenkrautsaft your x,y position is used to deterministically seed the RNG, so if you're at a specific pixel position the rng for the spawn comes out the same
[2022-12-31 16:18:34] <%+Wckdneer> @bohnenkrautsaft it's..... a thing
[2022-12-31 16:18:55] <%+Wckdneer> what myndzi said

[2022-12-31 16:18:57] <%myndzi> well used as part of seeding the RNG anyway

[2022-12-31 16:32:20] <%+dusty_sprinkles> you could just keep shifting the poly till it goes away

[2022-12-31 16:32:24] <%+dusty_sprinkles> you only need to get rid of it once
[2022-12-31 16:32:29] <%$Heeknot> just keep fungle shifting until everything is 1 element that isnt poly

[2022-12-31 17:06:29] <%nikita20031405> @octaheart getting greater chest
[2022-12-31 17:06:33] <cruckz> @dunkorslam can you explain what you’re doing with the coordinates and the explosions?
[2022-12-31 17:06:35] <%Pagrax> @WUOTE His should have both settings.
[2022-12-31 17:06:54] <%s3xygirl6969> coordinate give orb and sampo
[2022-12-31 17:06:59] <%WUOTE> cause you DONT have an aperture to control exposition of the sensor @Pagrax
[2022-12-31 17:07:02] <OctaHeart> @nikita20031405 What does he need the Greater Chest for? And does he need to be in this specific spot for it?
[2022-12-31 17:07:05] <+donsnypa> what is sampo ?
[2022-12-31 17:07:13] <cruckz> What is shampoo?
[2022-12-31 17:07:14] <%opaa> Is Chase a vampire? The most popular theory that supports this is the fact that he starts streaming late at night after sunset and never goes out in the sun.
[2022-12-31 17:07:16] <%+shmameron> what is love?
[2022-12-31 17:07:25] <%Televis10n> would it be better to cast into everything really high above the spot so that the chest lands on the platforms
[2022-12-31 17:07:30] <%WUOTE> WHAT IS THROW?
[2022-12-31 17:07:31] <%nikita20031405> @octaheart if he is in this specific coordinate,  greater chest can drop the sampo
[2022-12-31 17:07:44] <%Pagrax> @WUOTE Even with the c920 I can control exposure. He has the c922 IIRC? Same stuff. He has parts of the image that are nearing white out levels, so you can drop the exposure in the webcam and raise the gain so that you maintain dynamic range. Like, that's exactly what I have to do with mine.
[2022-12-31 17:07:46] <sgtjaney> @shmameron baby dont hurt  me
[2022-12-31 17:07:46] <%Nauk> @WUOTE baby dont hurt me...
[2022-12-31 17:07:46] <%SectionTIC> Baby don't hurt me... no more... catJAM
[2022-12-31 17:07:46] <%smily277353> 69 nice
[2022-12-31 17:07:48] <%Spiritsmaker> Sampo is the cogwheel in front of the final boss
[2022-12-31 17:07:52] <%s3xygirl6969> greater chest spawn orb and sampos. coordinate are used because randomness is based on coordinate
[2022-12-31 17:07:56] <+donsnypa> Oo
[2022-12-31 17:07:57] <Corephinx> Wont the chest fall far down?
[2022-12-31 17:08:03] <%Nauk> that was glorious guy /highfive
[2022-12-31 17:08:08] <phu29the3rd> prediction: something goes wrong and he get poly but somehow dont die
[2022-12-31 17:08:08] <%SectionTIC> @Nauk Nice! LUL

[2022-12-31 17:08:31] <OctaHeart> Wait, but if it's in the chest, but also in front of the final boss, wouldn't that mean that there are two sampos in the world? Does that mean you can activate the ending twice?
[2022-12-31 17:08:35] <TLV_TV> how do you continue the run after doing the pure or happy ending then?
[2022-12-31 17:08:47] <phu29the3rd> @OctaHeart more than twice
[2022-12-31 17:08:53] <kowed3lia> monkaS

[2022-12-31 17:09:30] <psy_dyl> this is fuckin terrifying
[2022-12-31 17:09:31] <%myndzi> @dunk make a hole by poly reservoir, use flask to fill, mix chaotic
[2022-12-31 17:09:35] <%WUOTE> @Pagrax aight i dont know anything about cameras so i wouldnt argue
[2022-12-31 17:09:35] <%myndzi> @DunkOrSlam i mean
[2022-12-31 17:09:36] <OctaHeart> If you have to either kill the final boss or go through... whatever the hell The End of Everything is, then how do you get the Sampo more than twice?
[2022-12-31 17:09:45] <DashinDolphin> just rejoining. What's the purpose of drinking poly?
[2022-12-31 17:09:48] <kaapo> !wands
[2022-12-31 17:09:48] <%nikita20031405> @octaheart yeah, but also you duplicate them with a long teleport, but Dunk is too afraid too use it

[2022-12-31 17:09:49] <%Spiritsmaker> @kowed3lia Yes, hence the coordinate mod being used
[2022-12-31 17:09:53] <phu29the3rd> you can go back to that vat and drop some toxice sluge into it
[2022-12-31 17:09:59] <+iLordEx> how many pillars you got left?
[2022-12-31 17:10:00] <OctaHeart> Since from my understanding, there's only one boss and one greater chest coordinate
[2022-12-31 17:10:01] <%Televis10n> got to look at your prize even if you didn't get the right thing
[2022-12-31 17:10:01] <+iLordEx> you still around 33?
[2022-12-31 17:10:01] <kaapo> what if you had reduced lifetime on the platform?
[2022-12-31 17:10:08] <%kindmonster3397> @DashinDolphin gives poly immune when you have iron stomach
[2022-12-31 17:10:16] <BroShock_> @DashinDolphin Iron stomach gives you immunity to stuff you drink

[2022-12-31 17:23:24] <%+Wckdneer> @NonHindicNic no, a health pickup is always +25 health unless you have a perk stronger hearts in which case +50 health

[2022-12-31 17:55:41] <%ba_nanananananana> that forced recoil is what makes it work tho. It's more of a bug than a feature, overwriting the recoil to the forced low value

[2022-12-31 17:58:51] <%myndzi> so it's just one fewer wand to search for, and the other wands may have been more suitable for their current purposes, or more convenient

[2022-12-31 18:07:06] <%em_tiness> Hey guys i want to wish you all a happy new year. Discord is full of copypasted new year messages, that people don't even read and just forward to other servers. I don't like that. I like to write what i deeply wish and what comes from my heart. Our friendships, from the most deep ones to the most virtual ones are very important and will never be represented by a simple message copied from elsewhere. This being said I would like to thank all of you. You are the best hockey team i've ever played

[2022-12-31 18:18:31] <%myndzi> interesting: Dick is a nickname most often for Richard, which likely originated in the Middle Ages as rhyming slang for "Rick", as did William → Will → Bill and Robert → Rob → Bob

[2022-12-31 18:55:46] <%Lukas39415> Cheer100 Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

The gameplay looks fast-paced and action-packed, and the graphics are just gorgeous. Plus, the fact that every single pixel is simulated in real-time is just mind-blowing.  I've heard so many great things about Noita from my friends who have already played it. They can't stop raving about the procedurally generated levels, the diverse array of spells and weapons.

[2022-12-31 19:11:03] <%$CKNoir> thought there was no avarice in parallels
[2022-12-31 19:11:06] <%snebrr> the diamond doesn't spawn in parallels does it?
[2022-12-31 19:11:06] <%HawkeyeTTV> DUNK THEY DONT EXIST IN PARALLEL
[2022-12-31 19:11:06] <%+dusty_sprinkles> it doesn't no

[2022-12-31 19:11:11] <%thatgboye> new ng+?
[2022-12-31 19:11:22] <%xurxo__> yeah im pretty sure there isnt that diamond in parallels
[2022-12-31 19:11:27] <%+dusty_sprinkles> If you mess up one diamond you have to do another peaceful ending

[2022-12-31 19:11:54] <%$Bolt_> The game been scamming lately. I didn’t have a fire essence in my normal run
[2022-12-31 19:11:54] <%myndzi> if it just failed to spawn because of some memory shit, maybe it'll spawn after a restart
[2022-12-31 19:11:55] <+Drunkenshoe> Friend is not in NG+
[2022-12-31 19:11:56] <%nolava> It just means you’ll need another 3 EoE and another peaceful
[2022-12-31 19:12:00] <%First_Mesmer> Can you make a platform there and stand on that instead?  Does it just detect you standing in that location?
[2022-12-31 19:12:08] <%djIights> @zulublue42 he has taken the curse of greed from the tree.   it curses the ground around you

[2022-12-31 19:14:51] <%DarthJawa5> i guess you just have to do it in another peaceful
[2022-12-31 19:14:52] <+Drunkenshoe> Weird. Usually the trigger still exists even without the diamond. Best bet is prolly an extra peaceful ending.

[2022-12-31 19:15:27] <%$Niborius> Maybe the diamond will still work without it actually being there physically?
[2022-12-31 19:15:27] <Vexilus_> don't you need both Sampo before you go to peaceful world?
[2022-12-31 19:15:30] <%nolava> I would definitely not stray from the path, just do an extra peaceful @dunkorslam
[2022-12-31 19:15:51] <%myndzi> ah, it's not a time in presence thing? people were saying hover for a few seconds

[2022-12-31 19:17:13] <%DarthJawa5> if we can't do the diamond do we just count it as a bug and move on or is it a restart?

[2022-12-31 20:43:45] <%Letaali> I literally just woke up. But yeah the plan had wiggle room, the peaceful world 3 had all avarice done already, but now it actually needs it
[2022-12-31 20:43:47] <%xurxo__> ok dope! thanks and keep on stretching and hydrating! @DunkOrSlam dnkLove dnkBlessed
[2022-12-31 20:43:47] <%Mikemage> @DunkOrSlam imagine if daily also made it so that peaceful didn't generate the avarice diamond though OMEGALUL (and yes I know and saw you already used it)
[2022-12-31 20:43:51] <%Rychron> Sleep only in 20 min intervals during an event
[2022-12-31 20:43:51] <%+mrbackproblem360> why's he sitting out booze?
[2022-12-31 20:44:00] <%+KillaMac> @DunkOrSlam Where are we sitting at oldman on the run/event?
[2022-12-31 20:44:00] <%DarthJawa5> If you go to sleep you will be disqualified from receiving the cosmetic. Real fans stay up for the whole run 😎 (please help I am dying I need sleep)
[2022-12-31 20:44:03] <%ba_nanananananana> if he dies, probably Monday LUL

[2022-12-31 20:45:59] <%DeriumEnvy> It seems like some of the stones got eaten by the essence projectiles
[2022-12-31 20:45:59] <%volymic> @DunkOrSlam it seems you exploded the other stones

[2022-12-31 20:46:32] <%Letaali> shoot essence eater with your wand if the explosions can cause that

[2022-12-31 20:55:01] <%SidNDeed> I don't think it'd even be possible to upload it to YouTube in 1 video, don't they have a 10 hour limit now?

[2022-12-31 21:03:59] <%First_Mesmer> @DunkOrSlam Just checking, but was it a problem that you just loaded the scales?
[2022-12-31 21:03:59] <Stick_X> Exactly, you did it. The game is just borfed.

[2022-12-31 21:04:15] <+Ramiesel> game says 63, its 63

[2022-12-31 21:04:19] <pood707> the bet says 64 BET FAILED
[2022-12-31 21:04:21] <%Slam_fan> The title says 64 PILLARS
[2022-12-31 21:04:22] <%Ultimhate> I count this as 64, Nifty is absolutely right

[2022-12-31 21:04:31] <alchemechanist> @Nifty255 evidently he did NOT perform the actions that would give him 64 Kappa
[2022-12-31 21:04:32] <%m0k0z> Noita and Nolla wouldn't lie, it's 63 now
[2022-12-31 21:04:37] <%pamplonaqrad> this is BS! i did not agree to a 63 1600th run >:| you also used streamer wands and chat knows this game was rigged from the beginning because of it

[2022-12-31 21:05:04] <%Dr_h0nK> it is 64 <3

[2022-12-31 22:24:44] <%+ailoops> @theemx The end of everything spell spawns a chest, the content of the chest depends on where he is in the world. He used an online tool to find out where he needs to be in x y to spawn a "sampo" or an orb

[2022-12-31 22:38:06] <%+theTetrox> i think thats too easy, you should do it without the mod Kappa
[2022-12-31 22:38:14] <%myndzi> @Vexilus_ that's what i was saying yeah. you can reduce necessary duration by moving away faster
[2022-12-31 22:38:16] <%Spiritsmaker> Chat, he is trying to farm some Orbs by using the End of Everything Spells
[2022-12-31 22:38:20] <%Aliasbot> if you cast eoe and platform at the same time it would just delete the platform right?

You have the 62 pillars, and you have no 63rd you got a problem building your 63rd. You have the 62..you have the 62 pillars and you don't have the 63rd or 64th, the 62nd, it is easier to build.

[2022-12-31 23:03:31] <RedRabbitRomp> I always feel so bad for you doing these really long streams.  You could just break it up and no one would mind.

[2022-12-31 23:04:11] <Vexilus_> you did forget to grab it once already
[2022-12-31 23:04:12] <%+Wckdneer> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2022-12-31 23:05:31] <%Ardbug> 69 pillars would be WAY off the mark, but somehow still acceptable :D
[2022-12-31 23:05:31] <%DarthJawa5> if this ends within an hour, it means he died
[2022-12-31 23:05:36] <%+mugsydiscgolf> is this the last run
[2022-12-31 23:05:42] <%Viowlet> @DunkOrSlam that just means you need to do one more pillar during the next event viowle2Little
[2022-12-31 23:05:43] <%+Wckdneer> @mugsydiscgolf not if he dies pepeLaugh
[2022-12-31 23:05:43] <%threebabies> 75-6 leaves us 64.....it's not possible on the dialy to do the other one so it's 63.... sad
[2022-12-31 23:05:50] <%+Wckdneer> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute.

[2022-12-31 23:05:57] <%+Wckdneer> that's the real explanation
[2022-12-31 23:05:57] <+UberDeft> so we all get our money back and everyone goes home
[2022-12-31 23:05:59] <%TheeMX> @threebabies maths
[2022-12-31 23:06:01] <alemz_ice> And why did you do it on the daily run to start with? Not judging, just asking
[2022-12-31 23:06:03] <%WizenP> so we still got scsmmed
[2022-12-31 23:06:06] <%Capta1nK1ng> why wont it credit the pillar on daily?

[2022-12-31 23:08:39] <%Rychron> God created the 64 and the 63, and the 63 was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the dnkThrow, and let it divide the dnkThrow from the dnkThrow. ' And God made the firmament and divided the dnkThrow s which were under the firmament from the dnkThrow s which were above the firmament. And it was so.

[2022-12-31 23:09:16] <+聖誕快樂 (birthday_bobo)> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2022-12-31 23:20:26] <%+Wckdneer> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.
