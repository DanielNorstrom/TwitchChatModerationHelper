[2022-12-30 11:01:48] <+brooksie359> Honestly I feel like her saying a donators name on stream is worse than cheating in warzone. I didn't feel anything about her until she did that and basically brushed it off like she did nothing wrong.

[2022-12-30 11:04:45] <+brooksie359> @Atrionix yeah unfortunately twitch is so inconsistent with the way they enforce the rules. they should have just kept the 14 day suspension as backtracking is so bad. I mean what she did is against TOS and yet they decided to revert the suspension without even stating why.

[2022-12-30 11:09:04] <+brooksie359> @Atrionix yeah I think permaban for that is not unreasonable as it very much sounded like she was trying to dox them even though just a name might not be enough info. but the fact that she got zero punishment is so crazy to me. like I guess twitch doesn't care if you break TOS sometimes?

[2022-12-30 12:18:22] <@%Primen93> yeah MP streams are not that interesting to watch
[2022-12-30 12:18:29] <badvalentin3> I tried Death Stranding, and in 50 first minutes i spent 35 minutes looking at cinematic and after that you get into DHL simulator, so not really my type of game
[2022-12-30 12:18:36] <@%Primen93> CoD MP was never a good game to stream
[2022-12-30 12:18:53] <+Atrionix> I am not a multiplayer person, but WZ is so fucked that I just refuse to play that shitshow until they fix it lol

[2022-12-30 12:19:32] <@%Primen93> CoD would still be alive without BR. Because the MP was always popular. Just not for streams :D

[2022-12-30 12:21:53] <%D3aDsH0TSS> so probably april
[2022-12-30 12:21:58] <@%Primen93> And the BR kinda killed the MP. Because now they are not giving a shit about MP anymore. All the nerfs and buffs are for BR. And the Effort of new Maps in MP is at the lowest point it was ever in the history of CoD MP
[2022-12-30 12:22:03] <MarcusDante> Oh my Darkest dungeon is the bast, i've just got my copy of the tablletop boardgame version a few weeks ago, they did a great job with it, it's very similar to the pc game.
[2022-12-30 12:22:45] <%+dereul3r> is the taq v good as a sniper support? and how wouuld you compare it to other guns?
[2022-12-30 12:22:58] <@%Primen93> We went from 4 paid maps DLCs in the time frame of 1 BR Season now to 1 remake of a map in a season. It is horrific
[2022-12-30 12:23:13] <+theDevilPhotography> doesn't show teams on top, must be solo
[2022-12-30 12:23:30] <%thortpi> @Primen93 nowadays mp is brought to grinding guns/attachments role, I think
