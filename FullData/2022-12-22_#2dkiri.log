[2022-12-22 13:28:09] <%Silvertunga> My favourite Christmas tradition I've heard of is all the Jewish families going to Asian restaurants on Christmas :D

[2022-12-22 13:30:07] <%Gruuberino> @fa_eye YES! Boxing Day is the day after Christmas Day! So called because it is when you re-box all the presents you didnt want, ready to send to someone else next Christmas!!
[2022-12-22 13:30:21] <%TungU5k4> i had to take 3 days off, but its fine office is in shambles, nothing is working properly after we moves all the servers
[2022-12-22 13:30:46] <!%+Wrinxz> That sounds lovely Kiri! Much better than -20. I can confirm. Not Jewish but I have Jewish friends that do that. Though I also have friends that do that for Thanksgiving too.
[2022-12-22 13:30:55] <%+QuarkAu> I thought boxing day was when you get to fight with family and sort shit out for another year
[2022-12-22 13:31:20] <@%2DKiriBot> Don't let your Prime Gaming go to waste. Use it (here) kiriCool kiriBless
[2022-12-22 13:31:22] <%Silvertunga> I heard it from people in the UK and the US :) Because all the Christians (and most of the non-Christian majority as well, for that matter) are busy Christmasing they have free run of the town :D

[2022-12-22 13:33:21] <nagaskin> boxing day got its name when Queen Victoria held the throne in the 1800s, and is borne out of the tradition of wealthy families boxing up gifts to give to the poor

[2022-12-22 13:33:55] <Wrongness> yo
[2022-12-22 13:33:56] <%TheBigWolfy_Orkide> this quote is more relevant " he name comes from a time when the rich used to box up gifts to give to the poor. Boxing Day was traditionally a day off for servants - a day when they received a special Christmas box from their masters."
[2022-12-22 13:34:46] <%derping_dutch> lmao. I am the 1% who never says "Kerstmis" and just say "Kerst" . FailFish
