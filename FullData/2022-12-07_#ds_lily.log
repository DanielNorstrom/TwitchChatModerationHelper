[2022-12-07 13:01:57] <%Useless_Eater> peepoDetective I wonder what the implications of the physics of the solaris/lunaris fight would be considering how the sun/moon goes up depending on which one of them you're fighting, imagine the day/night cycle being crunched down to a few seconds and the speed at which the planet would have to rotate for that to happen

[2022-12-07 13:28:17] <NexaNTubing> basic formula for Seismic (rough) (tooltip/pob dps usual) x 6 traps x 2 activations per second x 2 overlaps x3.3 seconds of poison( or whatever duration you have)= X-M dps.

[2022-12-07 14:46:07] <%Nite01> oh
[2022-12-07 14:46:10] <%Nite01> idk about that
[2022-12-07 14:46:15] <%Nite01> I think it was char bound ?
[2022-12-07 14:46:18] <poggazoo> so you can use the same relics for all chars
[2022-12-07 14:46:19] <+unsavorydeath> If they learned anything it would let us store an entire 32 rooms worth for the mechanic
[2022-12-07 14:46:24] <ukod3138733> i thought that meant its still per character, you just cant trade them to other people, but within your characters
[2022-12-07 14:46:27] <+DracosDeath> i belive each charector has its own relic slots, but there is an account wide stash for them
[2022-12-07 14:46:27] <cheezkitiz> im for the trade sanctum leauge so i wont have to at standart so that the reason im hyped
[2022-12-07 14:46:28] <+Flampera> They are account bound, but maybe league bound too
[2022-12-07 14:46:29] <+machmalangsam> perfect mix with a little kalandra sprinkled in
[2022-12-07 14:46:29] <poggazoo> in some "relic altar"
[2022-12-07 14:46:37] <%Nite01> I thought each char has its own
[2022-12-07 14:46:42] <+unsavorydeath> 8 is "fine", but still not ideal
[2022-12-07 14:46:55] <%avipapis> the new mechanic will be at its best, if it literally feels like 2 different games imho
[2022-12-07 14:47:06] VIEWERS: 1 219
[2022-12-07 14:47:12] <+Flampera> Or rather you can share them between the chars you have, but if you die with it you lose it with the char
[2022-12-07 14:47:53] <%Nite01> today they kept me there 30 minutes to tell me how good I am and how satisfied they are of my work. They want offer me a "stable" job... idk about that

[2022-12-07 15:51:38] <Kliz> i want to play jugg this league but i tried levelling marauder and at level 20 i decided marauder is a second character
[2022-12-07 15:51:43] <Kliz> :)
[2022-12-07 15:51:51] <swallowingspiders> @Anderwilson never watched Carn?

[2022-12-07 15:52:11] <Anderwilson> Ive no idea what a carn is
[2022-12-07 15:52:27] <!%DoogieMacGyver> i just wish jugg was a bit tankier and had fewer damage nodes
[2022-12-07 15:52:37] <Kliz> how about playing it with like 30-40% less damage
[2022-12-07 15:52:37] <@^Nightbot> very carefully

[2022-12-07 18:11:17] <Shogun1922> strange question but, assuming we can get hex master on one of those new relic things would Ylfeban's Trickery on a melee build be decent? or is that a huge stretch
