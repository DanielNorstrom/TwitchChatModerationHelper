[2023-01-10 17:41:43] <%onlyzaclol> 15 min ff is a cop out. people die twice in lane and want to reset game
[2023-01-10 17:41:43] <%Marko3G> karthus best champion thats why i main it
[2023-01-10 17:41:45] <+solidussovis> Are kidding!? Ekko diving garen is easy. Through the bubble stun him even if he gets a silence off you still kill him
[2023-01-10 17:41:46] <oOQuanixOo> people already die 1 time to a lvl 1 invade and think the game is over
[2023-01-10 17:41:47] <%Saiyoid> good luck playing Kayle when your team ff at 15 every game
[2023-01-10 17:41:49] <%insertcoinspoppy> I dont think the surrender vote will do much since people just soft int anyway once they think they've lost

[2023-01-10 17:41:56] <LAMESTLaME0> yeah yesterday as yorick my team was losing and I got a quadra at 20 mins but my team still ffd :(
[2023-01-10 17:41:59] <%Marko3G> take out surrender and take yuumi with it
[2023-01-10 17:42:13] <bowlionekanobi> or if you are the only one who doesn't surrender you don't lose that much lp
[2023-01-10 17:42:14] <%onlyzaclol> i have to open so often b/c team holding people hosage for 28 mins
[2023-01-10 17:42:16] <xTwistedXD> or people pick kass mid and cry because they die once in lane LOL
[2023-01-10 17:42:18] <+scotian> more people would troll, grief, etc  if they couldn't ff
[2023-01-10 17:42:19] <+Sidedart> If people open, won’t it be somewhat easier to punish
[2023-01-10 17:42:19] <+kid_angeal> chances are your ekko was filled. take out fill

[2023-01-10 17:43:42] <+solidussovis> average game length is 25 min. Can you not honestly see at 15 if its won or lost?
[2023-01-10 17:43:44] <x_vastolord_x> i don't like the hostage situation of surrender
[2023-01-10 17:43:44] <hoangngo145> I can already tell this season is gonna be so bad
[2023-01-10 17:43:46] <$adbullet> isn't that the same argument against ANY surrender option
[2023-01-10 17:43:47] <+kid_angeal> how often are 4 voting yes on 15 tho?
[2023-01-10 17:43:48] <conor_layaire> I COMPLETELY agree with you
[2023-01-10 17:43:50] <+randomkappagen> no you shouldnt and yes you are right. its so obvious no real argument here

[2023-01-10 17:43:59] <jesterwhoahah> I hate giving up
[2023-01-10 17:44:02] <%Will_Faro> if you ff you should lose more lp maybe it fixes it @SoloRenektonOnly
[2023-01-10 17:44:04] <ChaosDarkPrince87> then they should force the games to be faster, because 15 mins is not a good "time sample" to forecast games that are 30+ minutes
[2023-01-10 17:44:06] <%+kodeshikou> what about the people that don't vote, their vote is counted as if they aren't there? 3 votes to ff, 2 no votes...equals unanimous votes to ff, right?

[2023-01-10 17:45:47] <%+Arly_And_Friends> I mean, it's subjective i think. Just looking at the instances where 4 people want to give up at 15 isn't enough. Why do they want to? Is there a fed jungler with 12 kills, or did you just lose a couple of towers or a dragon in a close game.
[2023-01-10 17:45:58] <%onlyzaclol> 15 minute wins when the enemy gives upo is boring af

[2023-01-10 17:52:09] <+solidussovis> Even when I am winning at 25 min I am kind of done. That is the bigger issue. Normal players do not want to be in a 30+ min game all the time. Especially when you need them to throw so you can win or make it competitive

[2023-01-10 17:52:53] <skippy1> @mobilestump116 ya that's the thing i don't get. allowing people to give up even more easily is not a good game mentality.
[2023-01-10 17:53:12] <%$Yodonashi_> I love illaoi but I'm so bad at hitting my E, I need to practice it
[2023-01-10 17:53:12] <XKanius> the solution would be, the guy who throw the surrender at 15 min is banned for 15 min, so he can relax and get calmed
[2023-01-10 17:54:05] <+ThisDonut> the majority of players want games to be 30min @solidussovis

[2023-01-10 18:42:43] <originalname002> i just don't think that bitcoin actually solves the issues with money. I think fiat might be better long term. Bitcoins value depends on how well it can be adopted long term. Not sure if it will be a good long term investment, but I doubt it will replace fiat. Anyway, sorry to distract with econ, focus up! <3

[2023-01-10 18:52:33] <+ItsRokkett> Some of you might not like crypto or think it solves anything, but blockchain technology solves so many issues. I would love to say blockchain is the future but I think it threatens a lot of elitist systems (ie the voting system) which is why it will be a long time before its implemented everywhere.

[2023-01-10 18:58:06] <+ItsRokkett> @ItsRokkett Sure, so take the voting system for example. Blockchain is unhackable, every vote would be transacted on-chain in each block. All votes would be traceable and transparent and CANNOT be altered. Current system IS hackable with these digital kiosks and we also hand count ballots still which is open to human error and is completely inefficient.

[2023-01-10 19:53:38] <%+BxTekniqs> getting fat is constantly eating wrong and not working out enough. Staying fat is eating a regular diet and still not working out. losing weight is eating less and working out calorie deficit. So losing weight sucks yes. But worth it in the end.
[2023-01-10 19:53:40] <+gragouli> what did you do for work before u became a streamer?
[2023-01-10 19:53:42] <SinasFrequencies> There’s a really good book about that “subtle art of not giving a fuck”
[2023-01-10 19:53:42] <%+Diamonddusts> That's typically due to age and metabolism o.o
[2023-01-10 19:53:47] <koolaidking5> If you’re fat it’s Bc you’re mentally weak

[2023-01-10 19:54:23] <%ItzYaBoi34> working hard is what makes life fullfilling, whenever I had nothing to do like once when I was inbetween jobs was the hardest time mentally for me
[2023-01-10 19:54:32] <%+Calcifer7302> Wake up at 6am for the gym before work at 8. Boom health living

[2023-01-10 19:55:21] <%+asd5a> honestly if you're overweight and want to lose weight easily stop drinking your calories; switching from soda, coffee with sugar, sweet tea and juice with water will have a big effect on your weight with little perceived sacrifice
