[2023-01-05 17:21:17] <%Trep333> the max author u need 84 totd authors for the season @Scrapie

Checkmate is when the king is under attack, and it is not able to get the attack blocked or move the king. Also, if the attacking piece gets captured, the danger is gone and there is no checkmate. Next up, flagging. Flagging is basically when your opponent runs out of time on the chess clock. Then you could say that you 'flagged' your opponent.
