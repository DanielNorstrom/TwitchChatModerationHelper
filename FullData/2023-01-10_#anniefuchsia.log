[2023-01-10 00:03:01] <%drzaius30> shame the caster set is not even close to how good the last set was

[2023-01-10 13:09:25] <%drzaius30> a pulled ahead of the msq pack Saved
[2023-01-10 13:09:41] <%drzaius30> first npc not surrounded by people LUL
[2023-01-10 13:09:54] <%Wardrick7> its easy enough now and gives a lot of achievements so i would say its likely this week
[2023-01-10 13:10:20] <%Wardrick7> im waiting with MSQ, have a full week for it
[2023-01-10 13:10:24] <%Taylor131313> we blast through normal now so achis should be easy enough
[2023-01-10 13:10:39] <%Sne4ky79> ^
[2023-01-10 13:10:43] <%Wardrick7> cause finishing it today means 6 months of wait for next one Sadge
[2023-01-10 13:11:14] <%drzaius30> 4 months
[2023-01-10 13:11:32] <%drzaius30> it will be out late may most likely
[2023-01-10 13:11:32] <%Wardrick7> still long LUL
[2023-01-10 13:11:42] <%drzaius30> any later puts it to close to ff16
[2023-01-10 13:12:42] <%drzaius30> Also i can't do expert roulette without having the dungeon done
[2023-01-10 13:12:49] <%drzaius30> which i just did YEP
[2023-01-10 13:13:39] <%Sne4ky79> 7.0 was graphic engine update?
[2023-01-10 13:13:47] <%drzaius30> Ye
[2023-01-10 13:15:01] <%drzaius30> apparently going to see some updates in the later patches 6.4/6.5 but no idea how extensive they will be
[2023-01-10 13:15:37] <%Wardrick7> im kinda losing interest in doing expert roulette as i have almost all tomestone gear for my main
[2023-01-10 13:16:01] <%Wardrick7> also whats the point of getting gear if im not savage raiding LUL
[2023-01-10 13:16:20] <%drzaius30> I need my tank geared also it helps with farming my tank mounts
[2023-01-10 13:16:20] <%Taylor131313> parse in normal raids xdd
[2023-01-10 13:16:29] <%Sne4ky79> @drzaius30 it will will probably be gradually updated
[2023-01-10 13:17:21] <%drzaius30> gear is great for expert roulette and 90 dungeons so can you skip mechanics
[2023-01-10 13:18:03] <%drzaius30> the tank buster doesn't even happen for me in the 6.2 dungeon in some groups cause dark knight damage is great
[2023-01-10 13:18:11] <%Wardrick7> true but they are easy enough already
[2023-01-10 13:18:25] <%drzaius30> not about easy its about time
[2023-01-10 13:18:50] <%Taylor131313> are you even tanking if you don't get railed by the boss anniesDude
[2023-01-10 13:18:52] <%Taylor131313> what a pussy
[2023-01-10 13:18:58] <%drzaius30> the faster i get through repeat content the better
[2023-01-10 13:19:06] <%Wardrick7> but the thing is you get gear from those dungeons to farm those dungeons easier LUL
[2023-01-10 13:19:18] <%Wardrick7> faster*
[2023-01-10 13:19:35] <%drzaius30> 605 gear though
[2023-01-10 13:19:50] <%Wardrick7> im talking about expert and tomestones
[2023-01-10 13:20:57] <%drzaius30> Also should note i play multiple classes
[2023-01-10 13:22:10] <%Wardrick7> im not saying its not worth for you, i mean i dont see the point to do it myself anymore LUL
[2023-01-10 13:22:50] <%drzaius30> sure
[2023-01-10 13:25:29] <%Geoffku> that's enough declines for now TrollDespair

[2023-01-10 16:35:01] <+KittehKaos> I think the reason they dont let it be in Mythic is cause you need to hard focus during mythics to time them, so you dont get distracted in Mythic+ however I think Heroic would be fine

[2023-01-10 18:18:14] <%Turbopumper> @lighting0108 A turbopump is a propellant pump with two main components: a rotodynamic pump and a driving gas turbine, usually both mounted on the same shaft, or sometimes geared together. They were initially developed in Germany in the early 1940s. The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use.
