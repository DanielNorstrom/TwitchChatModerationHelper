[2022-12-16 11:40:37] <H0Stile_> What did they do to buff rein?
[2022-12-16 11:40:43] <MistsTwitchAccount> nothing
[2022-12-16 11:40:48] <H0Stile_> ah
[2022-12-16 11:41:04] <H0Stile_> I was only half listening lol
[2022-12-16 11:41:07] <%GIRLinMaleBody> didnt they say direct nerf midseason then rework in jan
[2022-12-16 11:41:13] <Lvzt_> pins are still kinda bugged
[2022-12-16 11:41:19] <Sharkboy217> gm daddy <3
[2022-12-16 11:41:40] <MistsTwitchAccount> the tracer nerf was kinda perfect though
[2022-12-16 11:41:45] <Yexil_> at least ana is back
[2022-12-16 11:41:56] <MistsTwitchAccount> condidering ppl said 6 was too strong 5 a bit weak
[2022-12-16 11:42:16] <Yexil_> she can 2 tap tracer now right?
[2022-12-16 11:42:18] <MistsTwitchAccount> ppl play ana cuz they're used to her ig
[2022-12-16 11:42:24] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @Yexil_ ye
[2022-12-16 11:42:24] <MistsTwitchAccount> yeah she can @Yexil_
[2022-12-16 11:42:41] <Yexil_> lol
[2022-12-16 11:43:49] <%GIRLinMaleBody> genji lost nano blade
[2022-12-16 11:43:53] <%Nevs_H200OW> @LhCloudy27 you think ram will be meta with speed buff?
[2022-12-16 11:44:05] <%GIRLinMaleBody> oh yeah, ram buff with speed was stupod
[2022-12-16 11:44:42] <%Nevs_H200OW> i heared there will be a rein buff in january
[2022-12-16 11:45:05] <MistsTwitchAccount> speed buff?
[2022-12-16 11:45:15] <MistsTwitchAccount> oh wait
[2022-12-16 11:45:20] <MistsTwitchAccount> nvm I misread
[2022-12-16 11:45:35] <%Nevs_H200OW> he doesnt
[2022-12-16 11:45:39] <%Nevs_H200OW> BUT
[2022-12-16 11:45:40] <%Nevs_H200OW> rein meta
[2022-12-16 11:45:56] <Yexil_> you saw how all Doomfist streamers became famous after he was meta
[2022-12-16 11:45:59] <%Nevs_H200OW> maybe they bring back wallbang XD
[2022-12-16 11:46:01] <MistsTwitchAccount> Yeah it would be better to nerf the other heroes
[2022-12-16 11:46:04] <%mysstle> rein meta would force reinhardt into being a shitty character
[2022-12-16 11:46:05] <Yexil_> just let rein go meta for a couple weeks to get the cash money
[2022-12-16 11:46:07] <MistsTwitchAccount> rather than buff him
[2022-12-16 11:46:10] <%mysstle> the devs would change him immediately
[2022-12-16 11:46:20] <%mysstle> revert all changes and nerf everything that made him good
[2022-12-16 11:46:32] <%Nevs_H200OW> bring back wallbang and bhop shatter and all rein players are happy
[2022-12-16 11:46:44] <%alaviiva__> yo what's up
[2022-12-16 11:46:44] <MistsTwitchAccount> LOL
[2022-12-16 11:46:54] <Yexil_> that man plays QP
[2022-12-16 11:46:55] <%GIRLinMaleBody> then there is orisa
[2022-12-16 11:46:58] <Yexil_> you cant get his opinion
[2022-12-16 11:46:59] <%d3vil_ow> better than monkey?
[2022-12-16 11:47:02] <%alaviiva__> I would take a buff anyway though lmao
[2022-12-16 11:47:32] <%Nevs_H200OW> maybe just a small buff
[2022-12-16 11:47:41] <%GIRLinMaleBody> just a pin 250 dmg buff
[2022-12-16 11:47:45] <%alaviiva__> I went against chipsa the other day and we take those EZ
[2022-12-16 11:47:49] <%WinstonsNK> make cleanse not stop shatter!

[2022-12-16 11:48:52] <%Nevs_H200OW> ill take a few weeks of rein meta tho as long as they dont nerf him to hard after
[2022-12-16 11:49:15] <MistsTwitchAccount> They even removed gibraltar
[2022-12-16 11:49:17] <%Kakaobob> sojourn still stronk
[2022-12-16 11:49:25] <%WinstonsNK> its rein meta now but the plebeians dont realise it
[2022-12-16 11:49:27] <%Magicturtle12> what do when teamates blaming me for not going dva against pharmacy widow
[2022-12-16 11:49:42] <MistsTwitchAccount> @Magicturtle12 step 1 get out of bronze
[2022-12-16 11:49:57] <%+ecksdeexd69> Give hog 400 armor and ability to collateral hook people who are lined up
[2022-12-16 11:50:04] <%Magicturtle12> i tell them to stop dying but they don't like to hear that

[2022-12-16 11:55:25] <MistsTwitchAccount> I mean it just makes him way stronger in ult but not much more
[2022-12-16 11:55:32] <%Magicturtle12> yeah no damage buffs, pretty much just speed boost in shifted form

[2022-12-16 11:56:05] <%+Sacenpapier> I like how you pressure them to make space. Everytime I try something like that I guess my timing isn't good because I insta-die
[2022-12-16 11:56:12] <%+ecksdeexd69> Are you gonna play him at all
[2022-12-16 11:57:37] <endcosmos> good push
[2022-12-16 11:57:40] <%+AmonBull> @Sacenpapier watch how cloudy uses cover when he charges. Watch how many people are able to shoot at him at any one time, then go through your replays and count how many people can shoot you at any one time
[2022-12-16 11:57:41] <%+ecksdeexd69> Should’ve took him off the map
[2022-12-16 11:57:44] <sellingpotatoes> wuz good chat and cloudy!
[2022-12-16 11:58:00] <%+ecksdeexd69> I started playing like @lhcloudy27 and climbed from masters 2 all the way to gold 5. Thank you Cloudy!

[2022-12-16 11:59:04] <white_tigger7> well my time playing as a tank improved
[2022-12-16 11:59:20] <white_tigger7> playing as tank sucks atm
[2022-12-16 11:59:25] <%+AmonBull> @Sacenpapier these are just the things I've learned, feel free to point out anything you notice so we can all climb lol
[2022-12-16 11:59:33] <sellingpotatoes> Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus my king

[2022-12-16 12:00:17] <iiwii_2022> taking the attention of the enemy team SeemsGood
[2022-12-16 12:00:24] <%+lmmeqa> he gets whole hog against every fight
[2022-12-16 12:00:30] <%+lmmeqa> every fuckin fight

[2022-12-16 12:00:46] <%it_is_owen> Weird
[2022-12-16 12:00:53] <thelaziest78> @lmmeqa Just walk to hog so he cant hook your team

[2022-12-16 12:02:05] <%alaviiva__> she wasn't in a bad place
[2022-12-16 12:02:06] <endcosmos> It's such a dumb change
[2022-12-16 12:02:06] <white_tigger7> @LhCloudy27 hammer in your pants should be enough
[2022-12-16 12:02:45] <%alaviiva__> even if it is shield blocking it, you can charge it and break is shield and rush him after
[2022-12-16 12:02:52] <thelaziest78> dmg range buff is fine, but ult is wierd
[2022-12-16 12:02:55] <white_tigger7> @LhCloudy27 it's a passive buff, +50 skillz
[2022-12-16 12:03:06] <endcosmos> @alaviiva__ and you get your cooldowns back during it

[2022-12-16 12:07:52] <+a44ects> why do you think there aren’t any reasons to do tourneys in OW?
[2022-12-16 12:08:34] <thelaziest78> Monopoly ruined ow esports
[2022-12-16 12:08:37] <%alaviiva__> that's so bad though, that just destroys the competitive nature
[2022-12-16 12:08:40] <%Courage9D> u can make it watchable if its on twitch or watchparty
[2022-12-16 12:08:51] <%GIRLinMaleBody> I cant imagine playing this game without wanting to get better
[2022-12-16 12:08:51] <%+AmonBull> most of their competitive numbers are just people farming tokens
[2022-12-16 12:08:55] <ghawi2001> cloudy what do you think they should do to hog in the next patch
[2022-12-16 12:09:05] <SuS_Shanta> true, what would make me care about competitive overwatch
[2022-12-16 12:09:10] <catlike_deceit> well one of the biggest issues with blizz monopoly on owl is just that in my timezone it's impossible to catch owl games without staying up super late
[2022-12-16 12:09:22] <thelaziest78> When world cup died in 2019, ow esport died
[2022-12-16 12:09:29] <%GIRLinMaleBody> I heard theyre nerfing hogs dmg so he cant one shot lhcloudySadge
[2022-12-16 12:09:29] <%Courage9D> btw when is owwc
[2022-12-16 12:09:35] <SniiKz_> I watch a lot of cs / val / fn but watching owl / contenders can be hard to follow at times with how much is happening at once
[2022-12-16 12:09:49] <+a44ects> I think that there could be a culture change around competitive for sure. I was totally unaware of the monopoly on tournaments with OWL. Shit is so boring with all mirror matches, actual snoozefest
[2022-12-16 12:10:01] <%+AmonBull> maybe with microsoft they will make changes
[2022-12-16 12:10:47] <SuS_Shanta> if they streamed comp ow on twitch it would be easier
[2022-12-16 12:11:11] <MistsTwitchAccount> isnt it gonna be on twitch next year
[2022-12-16 12:11:20] <MistsTwitchAccount> or am i buggin
[2022-12-16 12:11:21] <+a44ects> Totally agree about the qualifiers and LANs. It would probably gain viewership for OWL too, why the hell do they have this monopoly on tourneys? Such bs
[2022-12-16 12:11:37] <%alaviiva__> but who's gonna watch owl in a years time, everyone watching will just want the skins
[2022-12-16 12:11:41] <%GIRLinMaleBody> theyre tripping
[2022-12-16 12:11:42] <Sadfthadsf> CoD is on twitch again so owl is probably on twitch too
[2022-12-16 12:11:45] <%Courage9D> would u change game if new epic game released with tank and ranked system?

[2022-12-16 12:13:10] <thelaziest78> So many countries refused to play owwc 2019 cause blizzard didnt want to sponsor them. It was so frustrating
[2022-12-16 12:13:26] <%+AmonBull> let buys Washinton, probably only cost a couple nickels
[2022-12-16 12:13:42] <+a44ects> There is such little passion and creativity in OWL, it seems very unenjoyable. I really think the monopoly is starving the competitive nature of the game. The heroes, playmaking potential, and fast pace is so much fun
[2022-12-16 12:13:47] <%Fjellern1> hallo cloudy
[2022-12-16 12:13:55] <+a44ects> But OWL makes it look so boring

[2022-12-16 12:14:29] <%+AmonBull> How OWL is presented is really stupid, it is like they are trying to be the NFL or something, but that is not their audience

[2022-12-16 12:23:52] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull and shatter back to 3 seconds
[2022-12-16 12:23:56] <MistsTwitchAccount> @AmonBull Wait was charge only 250 before? I thought it was 300
[2022-12-16 12:24:06] <%+AmonBull> yeah true 300
[2022-12-16 12:24:07] <XHXHXH_OW> It was 300 before

[2022-12-16 12:25:02] <XHXHXH_OW> I think just those shatter changes would go a long ways
[2022-12-16 12:25:08] <white_tigger7> @LhCloudy27 who's the most hated dps in this chat? Mei, right?
[2022-12-16 12:25:10] <thelaziest78> Ana nade buff does nothing. Kiriko still exist

[2022-12-16 12:25:30] <haemaelaeinen> @thelaziest78 Fair enough
[2022-12-16 12:25:38] <darkphoenixempire> I think it should be if rein is clensed then he can shatter even clensed enemy :D
[2022-12-16 12:25:43] <%GIRLinMaleBody> shatter has perfect duration stun. Not too short, not too long
[2022-12-16 12:25:54] <%MintJamz> They just want a challenge :)
[2022-12-16 12:25:55] <+Guts72> Tried the new ramattra buffs?
[2022-12-16 12:25:55] <dianuj13> no give rein flight, exo boots, speed boost, immortality, rez, double jump, clense i think might be good
[2022-12-16 12:25:58] <XHXHXH_OW> Really? Making it not able to be cleansed and making it 3 seconds seems good.
[2022-12-16 12:26:00] <%+AmonBull> nah just have clense not work on ults
[2022-12-16 12:26:14] <dummymattie> Why not just buff pin to 250
[2022-12-16 12:26:20] <MistsTwitchAccount> @AmonBull this
[2022-12-16 12:26:36] <+Guts72> Did shatter really get buffed to 3 seconds?
[2022-12-16 12:26:37] <XHXHXH_OW> Well if it’s coming from you I gotta agree. You’re the rein expert
[2022-12-16 12:26:43] <%doximanman> how to deal with orisa as rein? she just does way to much dmg and you usually lose the 1v1, no?

[2022-12-16 12:28:46] <%+AmonBull> If they changed firestrike to 100dmg, a bunch of people will walk out of spawn into double firestrike, go to forums/tiktok and complain

[2022-12-16 12:29:25] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull yeah I think that’s why other things need to be nerfed instead of buffing rein
[2022-12-16 12:29:30] <XHXHXH_OW> I’m on that train.

[2022-12-16 12:32:21] <XHXHXH_OW> I think what’s unhealthy for the game is when abilities counter ults

[2022-12-16 12:33:18] <%+AmonBull> something mL7 said was supports should do things to others, like anti-nade, not cancel what other people have done like imort and cleanse\
[2022-12-16 12:33:28] <DallasTelevision> i feel like ow2 main issue is lack of counterplay in general. sojourn just 1 shots, kiriko just erases any ability used, hog just hooks 1 shots, etc etc etc
[2022-12-16 12:33:49] <MistsTwitchAccount> @XHXHXH_OW I think it depends on the ult honestly. Gengu blade would just be auto fight win etc.

[2022-12-16 12:34:32] <MistsTwitchAccount> everything is easier with lucio
[2022-12-16 12:34:36] <+Guts72> I think they're gonna buff fire strike instead of pin
[2022-12-16 12:34:42] <nikoos_tv> not working
[2022-12-16 12:34:48] <XHXHXH_OW> Agree abilities countering ults is just  unhealthy
[2022-12-16 12:35:01] <XHXHXH_OW> Even anti in trans is dumb and always has been

[2022-12-16 12:35:29] <nikoos_tv> ty ahah
[2022-12-16 12:35:30] <Jenkzen> i wouldnt now on your lvl man your in a league of your own so i believe everything xD
[2022-12-16 12:36:07] <XHXHXH_OW> They always do what people don’t ask for. They wanted her ult to charge faster i don’t think it getting blocked was the problem
[2022-12-16 12:36:12] <dianuj13> Cloudy do u flame ur team less now that u completed no shield?
[2022-12-16 12:36:20] <+Guts72> I think they want Orisa to do well against Ramattra & Sigma. They probably were not thinking about rein
[2022-12-16 12:36:43] <MistsTwitchAccount> I doubt a single dev team member even remembers Rein exists
[2022-12-16 12:37:15] <dianuj13> Yeaa i dont understand the orisa ult change
[2022-12-16 12:37:31] <MistsTwitchAccount> they could have made the change for it to go through DEPLOYABLE shields or smth
[2022-12-16 12:37:47] <XHXHXH_OW> The only shield character really being played I sigma so idk why they buffed her like thay
[2022-12-16 12:37:49] <shiroikitsune_ow> i like it
[2022-12-16 12:37:50] <XHXHXH_OW> That*
[2022-12-16 12:37:55] <%Kakaobob> Rein should be able to pin spinning orisa
[2022-12-16 12:37:57] <shiroikitsune_ow> the ult comes from underground
[2022-12-16 12:38:00] <shiroikitsune_ow> makes sense
[2022-12-16 12:38:01] <MistsTwitchAccount> @Kakaobob you can
[2022-12-16 12:38:10] <%GIRLinMaleBody> orisa is a needy girl
[2022-12-16 12:38:17] <%macaroons98> just give rein pin reset after kill just like gengu Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:38:17] <dianuj13> like orisa is not bad against monkey rein why buff more LUL
[2022-12-16 12:38:23] <shiroikitsune_ow> no its not the its traveling towards you
[2022-12-16 12:38:26] <shiroikitsune_ow> doesnt hit you from under
[2022-12-16 12:38:31] <XHXHXH_OW> I thought orisa was perfect. She’s strong but has clear counterplay but now it’s like she rolls rein
[2022-12-16 12:38:37] <shiroikitsune_ow> the ow ult bruh
[2022-12-16 12:38:46] <%+AmonBull> what counterplay though
[2022-12-16 12:38:48] <MistsTwitchAccount> @XHXHXH_OW fr
[2022-12-16 12:39:04] <shiroikitsune_ow> she just has infinite cooldowns thats the issue not her ult
[2022-12-16 12:39:06] <%+AmonBull> you used to be able to counter her with Zarya, but then Zarya got nerf'd
[2022-12-16 12:39:12] <%MapleRoar> Orisa was one of the best balanced heroes I though
[2022-12-16 12:39:20] <XHXHXH_OW> Orisa might’ve been the most balanced tank. She was absolutely perfect
[2022-12-16 12:39:24] <MistsTwitchAccount> Orisa felt like exactly where every tanks should be in terms of balance
[2022-12-16 12:39:27] <XHXHXH_OW> But now it’s just like why
[2022-12-16 12:39:35] <+ChrisTheRookey> I play a lot of Orisa and I never thought she needed a buff against Rein, like ever. I dunno why they came up with this change. Maybe against Sig and Ram? I just don't understand.
[2022-12-16 12:39:39] <thelaziest78> I dont even remember when i saw zarya last time
[2022-12-16 12:39:41] <%Kakaobob> yea she doesnt have downtime always has some ability
[2022-12-16 12:39:42] <%GIRLinMaleBody> i wouldnt say orisa was perfect
[2022-12-16 12:39:50] <%+AmonBull> I dont see how you guys think Orisa was balanced
[2022-12-16 12:40:09] <+Guts72> Nah Orisa ult was pretty bad
[2022-12-16 12:40:20] <XHXHXH_OW> She was perfect. She’s was strong but you could just ignore her and roll her backline
[2022-12-16 12:40:26] <MistsTwitchAccount> @AmonBull because she was slow and her damage to anything but tanks wasnt all that strong, her thing was just that she was really fucking tanky
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <%MapleRoar> They should just let Rein ult go through shields as well fuck it
[2022-12-16 12:40:43] <%+AmonBull> ok are we talking about her balance compared to Rein?
[2022-12-16 12:41:06] <XHXHXH_OW> Cloudy a lot of low rank players hated her because she’s unkillable but it’s their fault for shooting her
[2022-12-16 12:41:14] <dianuj13> @AmonBull They gave her ult buff for shields
[2022-12-16 12:41:21] <+itsjoxius> Orisa was very healthy. Ppl really blame other unhealthy tanks for her being unbalanced
[2022-12-16 12:41:26] <%+AmonBull> I hate Rein vs Orisa, I'm only in diamond, but Orisa gets so much value, even bad ones
[2022-12-16 12:41:32] <XHXHXH_OW> Yup it’s a simple counterplay too.
[2022-12-16 12:41:35] <MistsTwitchAccount> @XHXHXH_OW yeah low ranks just dont get the fundamentals lol
[2022-12-16 12:42:24] <shiroikitsune_ow> orisa has 2s of downtime wich is really annoying
[2022-12-16 12:42:38] <XHXHXH_OW> I feel like reins pretty good into Rammatra though.
[2022-12-16 12:42:43] <%+AmonBull> I have a lot of problems killing her before her cd's come back up, killing anything with supports healing them is rough, how the hell are you guys killing orisa lol
[2022-12-16 12:42:55] <motha_ops_> what did u finsish last season?
[2022-12-16 12:43:04] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull you ignore her
[2022-12-16 12:43:08] <%+AmonBull> That is what I've been trying to do, just match her
[2022-12-16 12:43:08] <MistsTwitchAccount> @AmonBull after killing the backline lol
[2022-12-16 12:43:10] <shiroikitsune_ow> cooldown wise you just do the helicopter move then fortify then 2s later you have the spin again ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-16 12:43:20] <%Kakaobob> guys do shields still block ramattra's ult?
[2022-12-16 12:43:26] <shiroikitsune_ow> yes
[2022-12-16 12:43:31] <XHXHXH_OW> Play high ground and shoot her backline it’s literally that simple
[2022-12-16 12:43:39] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ram will just walk behind ur shield now
[2022-12-16 12:43:52] <%macaroons98> dew it
[2022-12-16 12:44:05] <%GIRLinMaleBody> answering to other chatter
[2022-12-16 12:44:06] <XHXHXH_OW> @girlinmalebody you can punish him though
[2022-12-16 12:44:25] <%Kakaobob> when is he coming to ranked
[2022-12-16 12:44:27] <XHXHXH_OW> Rein shots on rammatra
[2022-12-16 12:44:27] <%+AmonBull> when I ignore her and go backline she just gives it to me up the ass, and a horse is not something you want up the ass, she spears you, spiny spears you around so you los your heals, spears you again, body blocks with fort
[2022-12-16 12:44:27] <shiroikitsune_ow> he does to your whole team tho
[2022-12-16 12:44:33] <XHXHXH_OW> Shits*
[2022-12-16 12:44:35] <shiroikitsune_ow> it forces you to HAVE a lucio
[2022-12-16 12:44:41] <MistsTwitchAccount> @Kakaobob like 2 weeks or smth i think
[2022-12-16 12:44:43] <JesseSDG> pls change skin
[2022-12-16 12:44:43] <%MapleRoar> Rein is like a bulldozer up close compared to Rammatra
[2022-12-16 12:44:48] <shiroikitsune_ow> he runs 20% faster now
[2022-12-16 12:44:58] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull naw man I think you’re just making mistakes you don’t realize.
[2022-12-16 12:45:01] <shiroikitsune_ow> ur backline literally cant outrun him if you dont lucio away
[2022-12-16 12:45:01] <%GIRLinMaleBody> he runs way faster than any other hero
[2022-12-16 12:45:12] <motha_ops_> this game is gg
[2022-12-16 12:45:19] <MistsTwitchAccount> congratz on the pipe man
[2022-12-16 12:45:34] <Zqnz_> isn't it our beloved reinhadt main
[2022-12-16 12:45:40] <%+AmonBull> @XHXHXH_OW for sure I'm making mistakes, but I think I belong in my rank, I think I play well enough for my rank
[2022-12-16 12:45:59] <%GIRLinMaleBody> damn
[2022-12-16 12:46:07] <dianuj13> 5 man C9 pog
[2022-12-16 12:46:31] <ladyman111> wasnt the ramattra change literally just that he walked just as fast in his nemesis form as normal mode?
[2022-12-16 12:46:37] <MistsTwitchAccount> I think I had a game yesterday where on our attack half neither team's rein hit a single shatter we literally blocked all of each other's shatters
[2022-12-16 12:46:42] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull sure you’ll figure it out eventually. Orisa is pretty simple to counter it jus that seem oppressive due to those mistakes.
[2022-12-16 12:46:52] <%+AmonBull> @ladyman111 he got some cd changes
[2022-12-16 12:46:59] <%+AmonBull> more armor too
[2022-12-16 12:47:01] <dianuj13> ooofff that firestrike
[2022-12-16 12:47:03] <dianuj13> Nice
[2022-12-16 12:47:06] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @ladyman111 he didnt have speed penalty in nemesis form. He runs faster than omnic form in nemesis

[2022-12-16 12:47:54] <%+AmonBull> basically Ram either has shield up or nemisis up with his cd changes

[2022-12-16 12:48:14] <XHXHXH_OW> Sojourn is still too strong
[2022-12-16 12:48:17] <XHXHXH_OW> Look at thay
[2022-12-16 12:48:35] <XHXHXH_OW> They need to just remove her headshot on her rail gun then she’d be strong and balanced
[2022-12-16 12:48:45] <motha_ops_> @XHXHXH_OW yeah they nerfed everything but the broken part
[2022-12-16 12:48:55] <XHXHXH_OW> @motha_ops_ typical blozzard
[2022-12-16 12:48:57] <%GIRLinMaleBody> bodyshot railgun still does more than half of ur hp tho
[2022-12-16 12:49:04] <%+AmonBull> they could remove the headshot except in ult
[2022-12-16 12:49:15] <XHXHXH_OW> @girlinmalebody yeah but it’ll be better than now
[2022-12-16 12:49:22] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @XHXHXH_OW well for sure
[2022-12-16 12:49:35] <MistsTwitchAccount> sojourn is just a slightly less broken brig
[2022-12-16 12:49:35] <%+AmonBull> oh and remove ult from shield lol
[2022-12-16 12:49:37] <XHXHXH_OW> I think making it 120 damage at max damage is perfect
[2022-12-16 12:49:37] <%MintJamz> 6 sec cd to 7 sec cd. What a nerf
[2022-12-16 12:49:40] <%Kakaobob> does she still get energy from shields?
[2022-12-16 12:49:51] <Zqnz_> ramattra now either gonna be a block and shield pray to push moment now, or he'll be a passive to run it down type tank
[2022-12-16 12:50:00] <XHXHXH_OW> She’s gonna be the next brig watch.
[2022-12-16 12:50:03] <%+AmonBull> yeah
[2022-12-16 12:50:06] <XHXHXH_OW> 20 nerfs before balanced
[2022-12-16 12:50:35] <dianuj13> did u just high jump KEKW
[2022-12-16 12:50:48] <XHXHXH_OW> Def balanced
[2022-12-16 12:50:56] <motha_ops_> @Kakaobob yes
[2022-12-16 12:51:09] <Zqnz_> lmao, I feel like sojourn is freaking annoying, but at least she don't have slow now, so I can pass throught the choke without losing more than half of my hp from a single ball
[2022-12-16 12:51:56] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ye
[2022-12-16 12:51:59] <%+AmonBull> what % was her slow? how does it compare to Rams?
[2022-12-16 12:51:59] <+Xeffary> @Zqnz_ what's annoying about sojourn now?
[2022-12-16 12:52:05] <Zqnz_> uh I think they're the dame?
[2022-12-16 12:52:05] <Zqnz_> same
[2022-12-16 12:52:05] <XHXHXH_OW> She’s that strong but meanwhile Soldier didn’t get his sprint speed back after they nerfed it for his passive
[2022-12-16 12:52:05] <%+AmonBull> I was thinking they removed the slow so it does not stack with Ram's slow
[2022-12-16 12:52:12] <Zqnz_> yea soldier sprint felt like granpa speed rn
[2022-12-16 12:52:15] <%sansaburo> whats good cloudy
[2022-12-16 12:52:15] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @XHXHXH_OW yeah, they forgot about old soldier

[2022-12-16 12:52:19] <+itsjoxius> EZ Clap
[2022-12-16 12:52:27] <XHXHXH_OW> It’s basically just default walk soeed
[2022-12-16 12:52:31] <XHXHXH_OW> Speed*
[2022-12-16 12:52:31] <Zqnz_> oh god last time I was abusing the double slow with my friend lmao
[2022-12-16 12:52:33] <%Fjellern1> i am so fucking cold
[2022-12-16 12:52:44] <PetraYle> so cold
[2022-12-16 12:52:45] <%GIRLinMaleBody> no heaters?
[2022-12-16 12:52:47] <PetraYle> its not cool
[2022-12-16 12:52:57] <+Aceattack> ramattra speed buff is huge. will be fun
[2022-12-16 12:52:58] <%GIRLinMaleBody> its either dmg or slow
[2022-12-16 12:52:59] <%Fjellern1> i am shaking
[2022-12-16 12:52:59] <Zqnz_> we forgot about ball people
[2022-12-16 12:53:00] <XHXHXH_OW> Then they dumpster genji but hesitate on sojourn
[2022-12-16 12:53:05] <Zqnz_> we forgot about ballll
[2022-12-16 12:53:13] <PetraYle> it was like -16 in the morning so the houses are cooold
[2022-12-16 12:53:15] <%GIRLinMaleBody> genji is fine rn
[2022-12-16 12:53:21] <%+AmonBull> what speed is Ram now when blocking in Nemisis?
[2022-12-16 12:53:24] <thisisfake4565473> How cold is cold where you are cloudy
[2022-12-16 12:53:30] <%GIRLinMaleBody> nah he is fine
[2022-12-16 12:53:33] <Zqnz_> genjii is very team dependent rn
[2022-12-16 12:53:33] <PetraYle> plus I think some apartments dont let you adjust the temp yourself so then you just kinda freeze for a while
[2022-12-16 12:53:40] <%GIRLinMaleBody> raw blade could use mroe dmg tho
[2022-12-16 12:53:44] <XHXHXH_OW> @girlinmalebody genji is bottom 5 worst dps in the game atm
[2022-12-16 12:54:01] <Zqnz_> dev totally forgot about wreaking ball
[2022-12-16 12:54:10] <Lepoks> @XHXHXH_OW thats fine
[2022-12-16 12:54:12] <XHXHXH_OW> All they need is to keep his base kit strong and don’t allow blade to be damage boosted. What’s everyone asks for
[2022-12-16 12:54:26] <%+AmonBull> wait where are those numbers from? how is he bottom 5?
[2022-12-16 12:54:42] <PetraYle> lol
[2022-12-16 12:54:48] <%+Sacenpapier> Nice trade, worth it
[2022-12-16 12:54:49] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull just most peoples opinion. I’m gm 4 if that matters.
[2022-12-16 12:55:00] <Zqnz_> genji can't get solo pick reliably rn
[2022-12-16 12:55:23] <%+kemboi> 5min comp queue, is this what it feels like to be in HIGH SR!?!
[2022-12-16 12:55:24] <PetraYle> oh yeah junk got a buff too in the revealed patch
[2022-12-16 12:55:30] <XHXHXH_OW> Wait anyone notice he has the sojourn icon?

[2022-12-16 12:56:39] <+itsjoxius> @PapaFazool_ I was confused too about it. I thought maybe it was a edit at first
[2022-12-16 12:56:41] <%+Sacenpapier> The 360 shatter from yesterday was more epic tho.
[2022-12-16 12:56:42] <v_deity> Sent that rein to the abyss
[2022-12-16 12:56:42] <+ChrisTheRookey> Ok, Mr. Cloudy! I see you! ml7PogU
[2022-12-16 12:56:44] <+LunaJCR> this sojourn gameplay is insane
[2022-12-16 12:56:45] <Zqnz_> that rein just got bullied
[2022-12-16 12:56:45] <CALOVI96> 180 no scope
[2022-12-16 12:56:46] <Killua_111> ay ay ay ay
[2022-12-16 12:56:48] <%WinstonsNK> GOT EM

[2022-12-16 12:56:53] <%Kakaobob> Rein v Rein games are the best
[2022-12-16 12:56:53] <isaktornblom> Why do you have sojourn icon in the bottom left corner? lo
[2022-12-16 12:57:07] <%GIRLinMaleBody> sojourn decided to wear reins armor
[2022-12-16 12:57:13] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull probably a ramattra meta. I was looking for a team to scrim with and most mentioned they’ll be scrimming on him.
[2022-12-16 12:57:14] <sheotama> wait lmfaoo I just realized
[2022-12-16 12:57:16] <muhdyk> this sojourn gets buff, she has shiled and hammer now
[2022-12-16 12:57:26] <PetraYle> oh yeah okay it was fake lol, it was just big on twitter and I didnt think to check the real patch lol
[2022-12-16 12:57:29] <%doximanman> is it possible to react to a fire striking reinhardt with a shatter? because by the time you react to the firestrike and shatter, the fire strike animation is over and the other guy can block, no?
[2022-12-16 12:57:41] <XHXHXH_OW> @amonbull as far as dps sojourn, and maybe tracer still
[2022-12-16 12:57:48] <%+AmonBull> @XHXHXH_OW any idea what they will be playing for dps?
[2022-12-16 12:57:57] <%+AmonBull> ok
[2022-12-16 12:58:18] <Zqnz_> tracer+sojourn
[2022-12-16 12:58:22] <XHXHXH_OW> Ashe seems pretty good right now too since mercy’s good with sojourn and her so maybe her
[2022-12-16 12:58:23] <+Aceattack> what mistake are reins making who get pinned off map
[2022-12-16 12:58:30] <%sansaburo> is the hog update already out?

[2022-12-16 12:58:34] <XHXHXH_OW> Especially with ramatra being meta we’ll see though.

[2022-12-16 12:59:06] <Zqnz_> I fear infinite block meta, now that ramattra can cycle shield and block without any cooldown
[2022-12-16 12:59:31] <XHXHXH_OW> @lhcloudy27 yeah maybe. A lot of teams are scrimming on him atm so I’m just basing it off that.
[2022-12-16 12:59:53] <Zqnz_> I wonder what sens are clowdy playing ar
[2022-12-16 13:00:49] <+Aceattack> scrims hav nothing to do with ladder

[2022-12-16 13:00:53] <XHXHXH_OW> I guess we’ll see. Cloudy has good judgment on these things.
[2022-12-16 13:01:02] <%Magicturtle12> they're also playing on the old patch
[2022-12-16 13:01:04] <%Magicturtle12> not current
[2022-12-16 13:01:05] <+Xeffary> why does reinhardt make people do crazy things
[2022-12-16 13:01:06] <%+AmonBull> Korea was playing Doom even before the buff's

[2022-12-16 13:04:02] <warab8> The new map is very defence sided
[2022-12-16 13:04:26] <thelaziest78> maybe it was "streaming"

[2022-12-16 13:05:52] <thelaziest78> ah
[2022-12-16 13:05:52] <%+AmonBull> I need to rewatch how you play the map, wasn't paying enough attention
[2022-12-16 13:06:05] <Zqnz_> I hate the fackt that there are so many flank route rn
[2022-12-16 13:06:16] <Zqnz_> it's pretty anoyying, specially to play sambali
[2022-12-16 13:06:24] <Zqnz_> @thelaziest78 I'm indeed alive brotha
[2022-12-16 13:06:25] <XHXHXH_OW> It’s a pretty map I think they did well on the design.

[2022-12-16 13:07:08] <Zqnz_> but sometime I got confused on my own after getting punch then boop by a lucio, and I ended up in a whole different locaton XD
[2022-12-16 13:07:22] <XHXHXH_OW> Havana, Rialto, and dorado need big changes
[2022-12-16 13:07:33] <Zqnz_> I have to agree with that
[2022-12-16 13:07:45] <v_deity> paraisio is bullshit 100%
[2022-12-16 13:08:02] <Foamp> dude i’ve been saying esperanca is one of the best maps in the game
[2022-12-16 13:08:05] <v_deity> worst spawn I've ever seen for attackers against that arch
[2022-12-16 13:08:12] <Zqnz_> since the current newer map is less dependant with tank clashing with each other and trying to win the space
[2022-12-16 13:08:13] <thelaziest78> It is Friday bois

[2022-12-16 13:08:19] <XHXHXH_OW> Do you think it would be good to have more cover on the street phases though?
[2022-12-16 13:08:25] <Foamp> push has so much potential it’s just that new queen street and colleseo SUCK
[2022-12-16 13:08:46] <warab8> Finlaaaad map would be fire
[2022-12-16 13:09:17] <fernandomarti399> good morning my dear friend
[2022-12-16 13:09:22] <%+AmonBull> I love push, new queen street is so much fun for charges
[2022-12-16 13:09:31] <Zqnz_> I think more car would make it more fun
[2022-12-16 13:09:32] <Zqnz_> but
[2022-12-16 13:09:39] <Zqnz_> only for some character I guess
[2022-12-16 13:09:44] <XHXHXH_OW> Push is better than 2cp but once your behind it feels very hard to catch up.
[2022-12-16 13:10:00] <%+AmonBull> just dont get behind
[2022-12-16 13:10:03] <Zqnz_> push is pretty good when ur team  know what to do
[2022-12-16 13:10:10] <warab8> @zqnz_ i need what u smoke
[2022-12-16 13:10:11] <Zqnz_> but once ur playing with random
[2022-12-16 13:10:16] <Zqnz_> and they stagger hard
[2022-12-16 13:10:20] <+Aceattack> koth is more difficult to catch up in a round
[2022-12-16 13:10:31] <XHXHXH_OW> Yeah I can see that.
[2022-12-16 13:10:42] <XHXHXH_OW> I think it might just be a ranked problem then
[2022-12-16 13:10:44] <Zqnz_> @warab8 I smoke anti depressant and drink chinese herbal tea

[2022-12-16 13:12:24] <%+AmonBull> did you guys know you can draw in push, if both teams push the same distance, and the bot is in the middle of the map for overtime and both teams c9. I did not believe it until I watched a replay
