[2022-12-28 13:19:48] <%derping_dutch> is kiridifficulty also roleplaying? shenThinking
[2022-12-28 13:20:14] <+Baulben> group dynamic is so much more important than experience in roleplaying. The roleplaying comes from itself if the group dynamic works!

[2022-12-28 13:20:28] <%Silvertunga> @derping_dutch No, during roleplaying you just excuse increased difficulty from "suboptimal" plays as being in character.

[2022-12-28 16:33:00] <+GOATtheDawg> correct, its just a difference in the botany definition vs culinary definition. from a culinary standpoint, a strawberry is a fruit
