[2022-12-25 17:09:09] <%TheGolden35> @KaasKikkerKoning Bomber crew was fun, the game before that

[2022-12-25 17:09:18] <%+KaasKikkerKoning> didnt like space crew that much
[2022-12-25 17:09:27] <@%+wolfpoops> @Katsuro__o recent attack on kurdish people in paris
[2022-12-25 17:10:16] <%+Katsuro__o> oh damn didnt hear about that
[2022-12-25 17:10:58] <@%+wolfpoops> it was a right-wing terrorist, killed 3 kurds, which caused riots by the kurdish community, which in turn caused a counter-protest by some turks, which made it a kurd v turk thing again
[2022-12-25 17:11:03] <@%+wolfpoops> which is what they're arguing about rn
[2022-12-25 17:12:47] <%+Katsuro__o> bruh
[2022-12-25 17:13:19] <%+Katsuro__o> why do so many turks hate the kurdish so much
[2022-12-25 17:13:37] <@%+wolfpoops> turkish propaganda perpetrated by erdogan
[2022-12-25 17:13:56] <@%+wolfpoops> they are severely prosecuted in turkey
[2022-12-25 17:14:35] <@%+wolfpoops> bombed, gassed and killed a lot by the turkish forces, which in turn caused kurdish resistance groups to form
[2022-12-25 17:14:46] <@%+wolfpoops> which are classified as terrorist groups by turkey
[2022-12-25 17:14:55] <%+Katsuro__o> IN turkey, but shouldnt educated turks in europe be less effected by propaganda
[2022-12-25 17:14:57] <@%+wolfpoops> all of this is because they want independence
[2022-12-25 17:15:09] <@%+wolfpoops> @Katsuro__o unfortunately not
[2022-12-25 17:15:47] <@%+wolfpoops> ofc not all turks but there are still groups of diaspora turks in europe a part of the grey wolves movement or some shit
[2022-12-25 17:15:59] <@%+wolfpoops> (pan-turanist extremists)
[2022-12-25 17:16:04] <@%+wolfpoops> i know, its weird KEKW
[2022-12-25 17:16:37] <@%+wolfpoops> its like a never ending rabbit hole
[2022-12-25 17:16:37] <%+Katsuro__o> grey wolfs is the biggest far right group in germay to my knowledge
[2022-12-25 17:17:43] <@%+wolfpoops> well

[2022-12-25 19:00:54] <!%uplockk> it's based on the phases on the moon instead of the sun @tommykaylive
[2022-12-25 19:00:54] <%$Neetokiri> It contains 12 months that are based on the motion of the moon, and because 12 synodic months is only 12 x 29.53=354.36 days, the Islamic calendar is consistently shorter than a tropical year, and therefore it shifts with respect to the Christian calendar.

[2022-12-25 19:35:00] <%viktor_mehl> certain people would then argue that if give your children too much love they dont become indepentent. What do you feel about that? (not my opinion)
[2022-12-25 19:35:06] <%LadShane> You just have to be careful later about it, otherwise when he wants something he will always cry to get his way

[2022-12-25 22:27:46] <iuriemapping> @Consuming_Void 5 I think
[2022-12-25 22:28:07] <+Hurpud> a lot less digital sales in general

[2022-12-25 22:28:13] <The_Balding_strategist> @Consuming_Void without mod i think it is 5 but with mods there is no limit
[2022-12-25 22:28:21] <+Hurpud> some companies expect mildly intoxicated people to add a % to their sales
[2022-12-25 22:28:35] <%The_Yazoo> If everyone in chat subscribed, we'd have Skyrim
[2022-12-25 22:28:45] <%Consuming_Void> @Consuming_Void Damn that's a shame, would be super cool with different clans pvp
[2022-12-25 22:28:45] <iuriemapping> youtube algortihm is weird

[2022-12-25 22:30:43] <%TheGolden35> Zomboid is going to be amazing
[2022-12-25 22:30:49] <%The_Yazoo> I also find these cozy night streams more enjoyable, but am a boomer
[2022-12-25 22:31:10] <%Consuming_Void> @Consuming_Void There is? Is it like hard to do yourself or can you like rent one?
[2022-12-25 22:31:28] <%Naxrl_> how many people played on the pz server last time?
[2022-12-25 22:31:36] <sofort_abbruch3000> what do you think is the russian word for love?
[2022-12-25 22:31:53] <The_Balding_strategist> press the middle click on the map to ping

[2022-12-25 22:33:42] <%Vurburne> I believe the middlemouse special attack for unarmed is kicking
[2022-12-25 22:34:02] <%Naxrl_> @Kaid16 ive only played satisfactory and its really great but late game it gets grindy
[2022-12-25 22:34:07] VIEWERS: 941
[2022-12-25 22:34:08] <MonsieurQuantum> @Kaid16 Satisfactory is more polished at the moment but if you enjoy the interplanetary aspect then dyson is also good

[2022-12-25 23:25:33] <%The_Yazoo> @The_Yazoo Its not fully told, but the female ents left the male ents, and the females are "lost" suspected dead and the males looked for them for along time but never found them. So ents can't reproduce and are slowly dying out.
