[2022-12-08 13:10:00] <+calum__07> Either it gets buffed or all other cars get a nerf of the top speed maybe

[2022-12-08 13:10:26] <%abinator2345> @deathreaper361 c63 got buffed because julian gave it to franny to drive, jay aint got that privelege unfortunately
[2022-12-08 13:10:34] <maikyy96> when u find eddie for the wheels u just ask him if he can get the speed limiter off?
[2022-12-08 13:10:54] <maikyy96> the rr is 1000 tons and zooms
[2022-12-08 13:11:04] <HoldMeCloserTinyDanSer> It should have high top speed but take a while to get there
[2022-12-08 13:11:05] <alphybac> Jay can u rent a good car for a few race

[2022-12-08 14:58:25] <+Link4Boxes> @kylicks he would need to get something good as vinnys is a god tier bench
[2022-12-08 14:58:35] <+iiclustyii> Fairs but mandem have 0 while every other major gang have one also like josh said last night patar hard carried that bench

[2022-12-08 22:16:49] <+a_track89> or spam the button to find it
[2022-12-08 22:16:49] <emilyisme8> Thats sick

[2022-12-08 22:17:31] <+albin1711> @Sjoniz he edited and hid mid raid
[2022-12-08 22:17:36] <aliucxu> @Sjoniz Silent edited his house during an active situation to hide, its diffrent
[2022-12-08 22:17:39] <philiplmao> @Sjoniz no he edited his house will in a chase
[2022-12-08 22:17:40] <calhub> @Sjoniz nah his was different
[2022-12-08 22:17:42] <%+Sjoniz> Ahh ok
[2022-12-08 22:17:46] <+Toasty_Turkey> Silent got fucked cause he changed his house during an active situation to hide himself completely different lol
[2022-12-08 22:17:48] <AERO_101_> it's smart

[2022-12-08 22:17:54] <cammyjwils> M run in the snow
[2022-12-08 22:18:00] <Shunizzzle> I mean he’s rping that he built a wall in his room with a hidden entrance

[2022-12-08 22:18:13] <urouge_0> People have hidden tunnels I don’t think a hidden room is powerful
[2022-12-08 22:18:15] <Abi2abakaZz> Show it to patar KEKW
[2022-12-08 22:18:15] <%tahawkz> Its not powerful dont worry
[2022-12-08 22:18:19] <prayis_> if they can access it then its calm its just more difficult to find
[2022-12-08 22:18:22] <ORDHAJ> @krishxnaik NSX
[2022-12-08 22:18:30] <+StanStreams> It's the opposite of powerful it's good rp
[2022-12-08 22:18:34] <@%+DuckMan_17> not powerful, cause they can enter if they find it
[2022-12-08 22:18:38] <silentknight222> Nahh ur good
[2022-12-08 22:20:00] <%TheHushbringer> i wonder how the account is looking like

[2022-12-08 22:20:16] <stefanowichdk> @DuckMan_17 the only thing is having the stash there, just that. its good that he rp'ed it very well
[2022-12-08 22:20:30] <emilyisme8> 100%
[2022-12-08 22:20:39] <HoldMeCloserTinyDanSer> The stash is what they’d get a hunch on
[2022-12-08 22:20:46] <AERO_101_> it's like having a fake walls in your room
[2022-12-08 22:20:51] <+insycho> ur good cg have insane backdoors lol
[2022-12-08 22:20:52] <zeshan94> they can still find it through investigating so it's not like it's unreachable
[2022-12-08 22:20:57] <xenoo_s> it also makes sense for someone to not just have bags of M in their cupboard
[2022-12-08 22:21:02] <%+Jacobh1177> The problem is: can they find it without everyone crying about it being weird and meta gaming
[2022-12-08 22:21:04] <Aqil_A> Idk if you did it on purpose but your vod ain’t posted btw
[2022-12-08 22:21:18] <xenoo_s> and put them in a secret stash
