[2022-12-10 13:27:45] <Cecross> first time I have to agree with you
[2022-12-10 13:27:50] <%daweda45> arcane is better bro u need full bis ulduar gear to go fire ;)

[2022-12-10 13:28:11] <dooshbagistan> cxan u perma swap to fire now with ulduar gear
[2022-12-10 13:28:22] <Rhines> WorldLast
[2022-12-10 13:28:25] <%daweda45> ofc arcane is top
[2022-12-10 13:28:33] <Cecross> yeah I think you have to enter with 2 specs
[2022-12-10 13:28:40] <%$frozensky_> no, at some point in ulduar with ilvl buffs, fire will just be better

[2022-12-10 13:28:54] <%Drylolz> you need a ret pal, it's the strongest dps in the game
[2022-12-10 13:29:01] <ziestika> didnt fire require shitton of hit compared to arcane
[2022-12-10 13:29:02] <phoakes> You always have a ret though
[2022-12-10 13:29:07] <Cecross> ‚ôø ret coming through

[2022-12-10 13:29:18] <Osandh> 3% across 17 dps is like 50% dmg buff
[2022-12-10 13:29:18] <+lz_ttv> only 3% more hit than arcane
[2022-12-10 13:29:19] <%daweda45> until u get best gear from ulduar arcane is better thats just how it is
[2022-12-10 13:29:23] <roflmaster5> but does that ret have the dmg talent?
[2022-12-10 13:29:25] <+Zaior> wheres the ret? cant see him on the meter

[2022-12-10 13:38:33] <+stingslinger> Alot of the care bears now never played wotlk
[2022-12-10 13:38:34] <%+bigdogkdog> which achieve?
[2022-12-10 13:38:36] <bearfighter> iis this beta?
[2022-12-10 13:38:40] <%pugNana> you can do 1 boss at a time
[2022-12-10 13:38:52] <Brelshar> Easy mode Freya DansGame
[2022-12-10 13:38:56] <+Lugens> Everyone had this achieve back in the day @JokerdTV im certain its not like immortal
[2022-12-10 13:38:56] <Serayl> immortal is easy though
[2022-12-10 13:38:58] <Rudemus> yall all worng
[2022-12-10 13:39:06] <+PresBObama> bro it explicitly says you have to do it during a single lockout
[2022-12-10 13:39:09] <abilitytogoeven> it doesnt reset, you can literally do 1 boss per week and you would eventually get it

[2022-12-10 13:39:21] <%pugNana> @PresBObama for that 1 boss in a lockout
[2022-12-10 13:39:23] <+QippTV> immortal = all bosses combined Not 1 by 1 boss
[2022-12-10 13:39:24] <Beck_28> ulduar is open ?
[2022-12-10 13:39:26] <calippoHEHEJO> everyone had that fking title in original wotlk, it doesnt reset

[2022-12-10 13:39:40] <+stingslinger> @Beck_28 no ptr only
[2022-12-10 13:39:43] <%Ein23> it doesn‚Äôt reset. the wording means you can‚Äôt wipe on that specific boss during the raid lockout
[2022-12-10 13:39:46] <+Kerolgan> it means that if you wipe on bosses you don't get a second chance during that lockout
[2022-12-10 13:39:46] <vagabolt> it sounds like it only counts the boss encounters. immortal includes trashfights
[2022-12-10 13:39:46] <blazeefury> Algalon is hard , cus u have 1 hour to kill him and he vanishes
[2022-12-10 13:39:49] <itslarsson9> Joker did u do Algalon 25 yet? if how hard?

[2022-12-10 14:13:10] <%Mhyroth> Lore from Tankspot told us 12 years ago this was one of the easier bosse on hardmode in Ulduar. XT Deconstructor was considered one of the harder ones due to the DPS and HPS checks.  I rather believe a professional Raider with guides up on Youtube than a World First 60 balding strimmer from Malta :)

[2022-12-10 17:35:51] <Vaxhim> Isn't it the same right now with 10m KT weapons = 25m non-KT weapons?
[2022-12-10 17:35:54] <%Revolverrr_> yeah but each hard mode gives 1 item of hard mode though ? u would need a lot of time to get a lot of gear to dowhat u are saying

[2022-12-10 17:36:59] <%babam_ow> i would be ok with it being harder Okayeg
[2022-12-10 17:37:00] <%+supafantastico> good guilds can do 25 with nax gear kek
[2022-12-10 17:37:03] <jjampe> 219
[2022-12-10 17:37:07] <xokek3> 25 will still be hard for most guilds
[2022-12-10 17:37:27] <%+radassbadass69> no lmao
[2022-12-10 17:37:29] <Average__Andy> @xokek3 yes i agree. but should you not have to do some normal 10 or 25 to clear all 10 man hard mode? 10 man hhard modes shouldnt be easier thhan 25 man normal
[2022-12-10 17:37:36] <Blinkstrike22> no 219 in 10 normal
[2022-12-10 17:37:36] <xokek3> Jokerd take = easy is fun because im lazy
[2022-12-10 17:37:36] <were_friends> What is the count down timer for thats above jokers camera?
[2022-12-10 17:37:44] <+TheRagingMick> If what we all saw yesterday is any gauge of the skill top guilds are bringing, 10 man hardmode will take a month to clear KEKW
[2022-12-10 17:37:50] <+gateloz> yogg 10 man was easy bro
[2022-12-10 17:37:54] <+tinouguu> 10man hm was 226 not 219
[2022-12-10 17:37:56] <xokek3> @average__andy 10 hardmodes is supossed to be easier than 25
[2022-12-10 17:37:57] <Giannisxxxx> yog 10 0 is useless anyway
[2022-12-10 17:37:57] <+gateloz> we saw all phases on 1st pull
