[2023-01-02 18:06:28] <%+UnzipsRS> Imagine she gets nerfed this upcoming balance patch, we wont even get to try her at her full potential KEKW

[2023-01-02 18:06:52] <%naujokas3> also got a relic man in chaos gate yesterday so i was able to finish my all level 7 gems

[2023-01-02 18:07:16] <%SyzzAMV> I think summoner got a nerf last patch too, not sure if it will again COPIUM
[2023-01-02 18:07:23] <%+Niki_xyOn> arty is unfair xD
[2023-01-02 18:07:31] <%+UnzipsRS> i dont think they will touch deathblow tbh
[2023-01-02 18:07:35] <%naujokas3> i uploaded my ss to lost ark group also got lvl 23 weap on 31st
[2023-01-02 18:07:41] <%Grizzlybooey> Stare Arti is Fine
[2023-01-02 18:07:59] <@%+strengthie> Arti is hardest class in the game it should do most dmg :D
[2023-01-02 18:08:09] <%naujokas3> thats the new one snow
[2023-01-02 18:08:11] <%SyzzAMV> pistoleer books were actually sold out on NAE earlier in anticipation of buffs ICANT

[2023-01-02 18:08:25] <%Kwadrat_> id say arty is as unfair as summoner and yet in real combat its way harder to unload whole wheelchair rotation
[2023-01-02 18:08:32] <@%+strengthie> ^
[2023-01-02 18:08:36] <%+Niki_xyOn> if they nerf deathblow, i cry my wasted gold
[2023-01-02 18:08:41] <%naujokas3> i still cant believe bro my weapon from 19-23 havent gotten past 10% artisan :D
[2023-01-02 18:08:50] <%polig> pistol wont get buffed
[2023-01-02 18:08:54] <%polig> if anything EW
[2023-01-02 18:08:54] <@%+strengthie> It's slow as fuck and everything has a delay

[2023-01-02 18:09:37] <%+UnzipsRS> Arti is still a hitmaster class at the end of the day
[2023-01-02 18:09:42] <%+UnzipsRS> even if it is slow

[2023-01-02 18:10:07] <%Kwadrat_> i mean thats true but isnt surge same way? and its way easier to hit with 1 skill than use 2 delayed rockets and 2 holding skills while immobile i mean by any means its dmg is absurd but i think i never unloaded whole rotation on clown KEKW
[2023-01-02 18:10:11] <%+DennySommer> i done brel 6 and left everything open on my 8 chars xd

[2023-01-02 18:25:08] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Like the difference between PM and TTH is so marginal that it boils down to preference but the difference between Surge and RE is so huge.
[2023-01-02 18:25:09] <%Grizzlybooey> But Honed is Really Good At RE
[2023-01-02 18:25:18] <%Grizzlybooey> His Uptime is incredible

[2023-01-02 18:25:24] <%Grizzlybooey> YEP i  agree
[2023-01-02 18:25:29] <%+UnzipsRS> honed only wanted him to play RE because its what he plays

[2023-01-02 18:25:50] <%Grizzlybooey> Ive seen Honed, out DPS Surge often, But he has to work hard to do it YEP
[2023-01-02 18:25:57] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> @DennySommer RE is totally fine, Surge is just insanely strong.
[2023-01-02 18:26:04] <%+DennySommer> RE need hit 4 backattacks for the same dmg as surge
[2023-01-02 18:26:14] <%polig> btw i did gatekeep reapers for 1 day and i spent like 10 mins watching vykis p1 grp with 2 reapers not be able to dps to 30 with nine -.=

[2023-01-02 18:26:24] <%polig> never again
[2023-01-02 18:26:28] VIEWERS: 281
[2023-01-02 18:26:30] <whipseclip> if you can make the same damage but do it easier and less stresful, you'd pick the easier stuff. why would i work double for the same result
[2023-01-02 18:26:30] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-02 18:26:34] <%+UnzipsRS> also imagine how triggering it must be if you pop maelstrom to do ur rotation and boss hits u or you get knocked down
[2023-01-02 18:26:37] <@%+strengthie> I think RE is ok but it's certainly less fun
[2023-01-02 18:26:38] <%Grizzlybooey> The Cutscenes on Valtan and Vikass made him miss a couple of surges
[2023-01-02 18:26:39] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Wait he went RE 1 instead of Adrenaline 1?
[2023-01-02 18:26:40] <%+UnzipsRS> have fun waiting an entire cycle to play ur rotation
[2023-01-02 18:26:42] <%polig> back behind that gate bastas!
[2023-01-02 18:26:47] <%Grizzlybooey> The Cutscenes on Valtan and Vikass made him miss a couple of surges, thats all it took, not to play Surge
[2023-01-02 18:26:48] <@%+strengthie> but not RE1
[2023-01-02 18:27:26] <%SyzzAMV> imo blade is like striker - it is not an alt you can half ass - its either a main/2nd main or forget about it
[2023-01-02 18:27:48] <%Grizzlybooey> He also said that , but Deathblow, or surge, theres no timer
[2023-01-02 18:27:52] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Ehhhhhh I don't agree with that. If that statement were true, literally everyone would just play igniter because it's braindead. You work harder because the class is fun. If I wanna MVP on Scouter, I have to play perfect but if I just sneeze on Scrapper, I MVP KEKW
[2023-01-02 18:28:19] <@%+strengthie> Every class has a class engraving for Beer drinking and the other one for non beer drinking :D
[2023-01-02 18:28:26] <whipseclip> @Hi_Im_JJ pls i main a Sorc, to say Igniter is easier is retarded

[2023-01-02 18:28:28] <%polig> if u ever see event reaper alt, shut that gate and weld it
[2023-01-02 18:28:30] <%+UnzipsRS> but honed wanted him to play the spec he plays :( sadge
[2023-01-02 18:28:40] <whipseclip> reflux is braindead Igniter actuall6y needs a bit of thinking
[2023-01-02 18:28:53] <%+UnzipsRS> surge is still better even as an alt, u literally dont need tripods
[2023-01-02 18:28:57] <@%ragingqueen666> do you want to quick do the pvp for tee party ?
[2023-01-02 18:28:57] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> @whipseclip I'm sorry to break it to you man, but igniter is actually the most braindead easy class to play in the game.
[2023-01-02 18:29:00] <@%+strengthie> @whipseclip see! Beer Drinking and Non Beer drinking :D
[2023-01-02 18:29:22] <@%+strengthie> @UnzipsRS I guess only 1 big gem too
[2023-01-02 18:29:32] <%+UnzipsRS> @UnzipsRS exactly that too
[2023-01-02 18:29:36] <%Grizzlybooey> The big diff, is there is no timer on Igniter or Deathblow, you can wait
[2023-01-02 18:29:38] <whipseclip> exactly my opoint, you actually have to save your burst for the right time, while Refulx u just roll over your keys as soon as they are off cD
[2023-01-02 18:29:40] <+TheJuan> mr B u got any g3g4 brel to do?
[2023-01-02 18:29:40] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I think igniter difficulty is just extremely overstated.
[2023-01-02 18:29:53] <@%+strengthie> Slap a 7 surge gem for an alt and you'll be pumping
[2023-01-02 18:29:58] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I'm sorry, saving your DPS for burst windows isn't hard KEKW
[2023-01-02 18:30:18] <%+Niki_xyOn> its same rotation than igniter
[2023-01-02 18:30:19] <%+UnzipsRS> my 1460 baby blade out dpses 1490 chars and it only has a lvl 7 surge dmg
[2023-01-02 18:30:28] <whipseclip> i didnt argue Igniter is difficult, i  argued Refulx is easier omfg

[2023-01-02 18:31:56] <%Kwadrat_> instant reflux crit type is braindead af all u have to know is how to animation cancel other than that is to fire on cd
[2023-01-02 18:32:08] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I disagree but to each their own. Just goes to show how different people's opinions on the classes are and speaks to how good the balance in this game is compared to others

[2023-01-02 19:39:49] <whipseclip> did they use class engraving or soemthing else?
[2023-01-02 19:39:54] <%+TrickmasteH> i think class whip
[2023-01-02 19:39:56] <%+TrickmasteH> for some
[2023-01-02 19:40:05] <%+TrickmasteH> but i am unsure, they def had some strategies going in, even no timestops in G2

[2023-01-02 19:51:33] <whipseclip> compared to two months ago, 7-8-9 and 10 gems are 30-40% cheaper
[2023-01-02 19:51:49] <+hermissick> i need 1-4 on bard

[2023-01-02 19:53:23] <%polig> @whipseclip i see it on this market, i saw things on RU market :) i know
[2023-01-02 19:53:26] <whipseclip> level 3 are especially much cheaper now
[2023-01-02 19:53:36] <whipseclip> due to 20 limit restriction so they combine them
[2023-01-02 19:53:53] <%polig> @whipseclip lvl3s are cheaper because of buying cooldown, you need like 90 of them for 7
[2023-01-02 19:54:36] <%polig> same for 5, its cheaper to buy 9x 5 than 7 because it takes more time with auction cooldown

[2023-01-02 19:55:32] <%polig> you are correct, people selling gems off for ilvl on alts and brel and people not buying them due to lack of gold, supply went up, demand went down
[2023-01-02 19:56:00] <whipseclip> well i see ppl buying them constantly otherwise the price will crash
[2023-01-02 19:56:19] <%polig> yes some do, not as many as 2-3m before the raid comes out
[2023-01-02 19:56:24] <whipseclip> just look whats happening to level 3 gems especially those that are about to expire, ppl have bidding wars on those

[2023-01-02 21:20:07] <%jackalo34> embedding is kind of annoying
[2023-01-02 21:20:23] <+klone_iron_fist> did he have a deal worked out for it though?
[2023-01-02 21:20:32] <%jackalo34> a lot of ppl do it tho to attract viewers or increase view count
[2023-01-02 21:21:05] <%+Tetris_Kappa> How is it bad to add the embedd though?

[2023-01-02 21:21:42] <+klone_iron_fist> seems very profitable
[2023-01-02 21:22:40] <%+Tetris_Kappa> But being on top of a category gives you a higher chance to get new viewers
[2023-01-02 21:22:41] <%jackalo34> yea but then ur highe on twitch n might pull in more real viewers bc of it
[2023-01-02 21:22:41] <+klone_iron_fist> BUT, you get viewer count, so doesn't it shhow up on twitch as a viewer and open up larger sponsor opportunities>?
[2023-01-02 21:23:07] <Opnusier> why is it such a problem when you can just block the entire embbed window with ublock origin or any adblocker with 2 clicks away if it bothers you that much? thats so stupid OMEGALUL

[2023-01-02 21:24:12] <!%micahlee83> he's worked with craft of exile for years helping improve that tool, the creator of craft of exile was the reason he is featured on there, he wanted to give back in some way
[2023-01-02 21:24:30] <!%micahlee83> they had it limited so it wouldn't bloat his numbers massively, they tried to do it ethically

[2023-01-02 21:37:22] <@%strengthie> Imagine you do a partnership with a streamer and a huge percentage of their viewers are basically bots

[2023-01-02 21:37:53] <+klone_iron_fist> @strengthie i'd like to think the investors are aware of the landscape and ask questions or is the market too new?

[2023-01-02 21:38:48] <%polig> and to be honest its not fair for overall streamers community when someone is gaining advantage with vbots, that is just legal vbot nothing else
[2023-01-02 21:39:04] <%givemebeer_> its bad on the streamer level and extremely bad for twitch as a whole because how many of your "viewers" are tiny autoplays
[2023-01-02 21:39:08] <+klone_iron_fist> like if I was going to have Baker run something for me, wouldn't I ask the question, how much is true view and how many are embeds, or are those numbers not attainable

[2023-01-02 22:37:54] <%+alex__gfy> swiftness summoner
[2023-01-02 22:38:10] <%+alex__gfy> too much investment for an alt IMO
[2023-01-02 22:38:22] <%polig> you can solo albert in 2 mins and under and its 25g x 40 leaps full rested
[2023-01-02 22:38:55] <%polig> nah i mean ppl going for desca
[2023-01-02 22:38:58] <%+Niki_xyOn> nah np
[2023-01-02 22:38:59] <%+alex__gfy> i needed a break from the deadeyes for a day or 2
[2023-01-02 22:39:11] <%+Niki_xyOn> my brain is finished with guardian
[2023-01-02 22:39:15] <%polig> i dont  think desca is even worth doing
[2023-01-02 22:39:38] <%polig> albert is faster

[2023-01-02 22:40:12] <%+alex__gfy> ive got em on a rotation, i allow 2 to get to full rested, 2 to about 60 rested and i keep 2 on 20 and rotate them now
[2023-01-02 22:40:14] <%givemebeer_> the real trick is using bynn ark and only forcing yourself to run stuff when it will go over max rest and then on days where you feel like doing extra getting ahead you go nuts
[2023-01-02 22:40:20] <%polig> 1-2 mins
[2023-01-02 22:40:28] <%givemebeer_> feels so much better than forcing it
[2023-01-02 22:41:38] <+klone_iron_fist> from a busiess stand point you should make YT guides to go with your theme week.
[2023-01-02 22:41:48] <!%micahlee83> @polig but deska is more enjoyable

[2023-01-02 23:50:24] <+LifeBreak_xD> i think so. including barrage arty.
[2023-01-02 23:50:36] <shinmen49x> nerf DB buff eso prolly
[2023-01-02 23:50:38] <Elmin_1337_> Arti imo is 1st on the list
[2023-01-02 23:50:52] <shinmen49x> thats what the striker needs I guess
[2023-01-02 23:50:58] <lemondemon89> i doubt deatblow will get rtouched, has things which limit it's dps unlike barrage or sorc or any hitmaster class
