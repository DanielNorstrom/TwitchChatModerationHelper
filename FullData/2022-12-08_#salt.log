[2022-12-08 04:31:42] <DevDogJones> @MrPecan easy way to explain it is super expensive accessories are good to cron, distos, accuracy accessories, deboreka etc. things that arent worth cronning are like any of the tungrads (maybe cron like tet ring and pen)
[2022-12-08 04:32:08] <DevDogJones> basi belts, ogres centaur secil i dont think you should cron

[2022-12-08 05:44:08] <penny_csgo_> bdo has alot of things to do
[2022-12-08 05:44:33] <+Hellhaven> It's only top 5 because almost every MMO is dead xDDD
[2022-12-08 05:44:34] <trashplaysgames> bdo has the best combat outa any mmo on the market by far
[2022-12-08 05:44:59] <%+CosmonautDrifter> If I was forced to play any mmo, I'd pick BDO. At least it looks good and combat is the best around.  I've jsut been playing PoE and D2R. Hoping D4 is good.
[2022-12-08 05:45:03] <%$xiMrMojoRisin> still have yet to find anything that feels as good as BDO. nothing scratches that itch
[2022-12-08 05:45:23] <trashplaysgames> It does and they're working on the stuff they need to it seems. mechanical grinds and such
[2022-12-08 05:45:24] <+Hellhaven> Maybe if it wasn't a KR MMO
[2022-12-08 05:45:40] <+wrrwrrw> it's because they always put money first over gameplay
