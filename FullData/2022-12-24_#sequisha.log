[2022-12-24 00:07:07] <%+BigDan1992> triple barb and go to town
[2022-12-24 00:07:09] <%$piedmontvirus> I think shirtless barb is a perk
[2022-12-24 00:07:11] <+klowdzy> I'm worried joining discord group, my teamates will kill me to take my stuff
[2022-12-24 00:07:18] <melodiousthonkvi> @diklikeatunacan The moment players get bored of the pace. The run and gun is kinda ingrained in our psyche with after Pubg.
[2022-12-24 00:07:20] <%$xaronax> @Sequisha We did barb/fighter/cleric. Barb shout and cleric nuke keep aggro managed so barb can just DPS. I was fighter and did trash cleanup
[2022-12-24 00:07:37] <+bchamp93> what perks do you run ?
[2022-12-24 00:07:38] <+LiquidWall_> @melodiousthonkvi PUBG o.O
[2022-12-24 00:07:42] <%$piedmontvirus> Think about berserker warrior
[2022-12-24 00:07:56] <%+Its_TK_> am i the only one that feels like the percentages bonuses on items are not noticeable at all?
[2022-12-24 00:08:05] <%$xaronax> @Sequisha I was full blue/purple and had about 125 hp as fighter and the magic missile 1 tapped me as he died lmao.
[2022-12-24 00:08:07] <jarryg> I wonder if we will get access to movement speed potions
[2022-12-24 00:08:11] <jarryg> and poison resist
[2022-12-24 00:08:25] <%$piedmontvirus> I like the felling axe it feels smooth
[2022-12-24 00:08:39] <+cliipd> chat do other extraction genre games have a zone closing? I only know of DMZ and this game
[2022-12-24 00:09:01] <%+Its_TK_> i hope the and better dual wield swing animations and combos

[2022-12-24 00:09:21] <%ForsaikenRedskye> that's a Florch. (floating torch)
[2022-12-24 00:09:26] <%+Its_TK_> or give the barb the ability to dual wield 2 main hand weapons
[2022-12-24 00:09:26] <%+R_Bites_Los> *they add
[2022-12-24 00:09:48] <+sly_marbo> I don't know how I'd feel about movespeed pots, it's one of those stats that can so quickly go from balanced to unplayable
[2022-12-24 00:09:54] <%+Its_TK_> @R_Bites_Los thank  you sir
[2022-12-24 00:10:03] <%+BigDan1992> @Its_TK_ You'd be so fucking slow having two times the movespeed debuff
[2022-12-24 00:10:05] <melodiousthonkvi> Bored is the wrong word. Edit: tired? Need for a ramp up?
[2022-12-24 00:10:05] <%faxwell_modemus> @ForsaikenRedskye not to be confused with a Floorch, which is just a floor torch.
[2022-12-24 00:10:11] <%+LusciousTigerAss> dual wield aint that great imo since its really just a different moveset. youd be better speedwise just having 2 separate weapons
[2022-12-24 00:10:11] <+fpbiggskid98> how much do you think a purple felling axe with 4.8 armor pen 4.9 phy bonus and +3 phy power is worth?
[2022-12-24 00:10:13] <@%W1re> is game audio muted or is it just me?

[2022-12-24 04:07:10] <spectorials> move speed is king as solo
[2022-12-24 04:07:20] <%Airwolf84> you need to close the range quickly so it helps
[2022-12-24 04:07:23] <%Khaladen> move speed = dodge speed, periot.
[2022-12-24 04:07:25] <RandoTheHero> true it's the factor that makes the difference imo
[2022-12-24 04:07:27] <+oleoay> that's also why they keep tweaking the fighter's speed and move penalty perks

[2022-12-24 05:43:04] <+TexasDJ> I think the Cycle would be in a totally different universe if they had charged like 19.99 for the game or even 9.99

Escape with it, you get a gold stash chest, which can hold X amount. Makes it fun to find it in the actual game, for several chars eetc.
[2022-12-24 07:09:33] <+NachosV51> yeah gold chests would be nice

[2022-12-24 07:50:43] <%BeeDMX> nothing is OP solo in this game
[2022-12-24 07:50:43] <%+AlaskanShrake> @schwiftyrick_ It has a circle, but also extracts, BRs are 'force the lobby to last man standing', basically a lot of good ideas with already existing genres

[2022-12-24 07:50:57] <magpie_81> yes
[2022-12-24 07:51:01] <KineticConundrum> battle cleric is super strong. Divine strike is insane

[2022-12-24 08:00:36] <iddqd> @sequisha The morale boost perk has been an absolute lifesaver for me in solos, especially in high roller. I underrated that thing so much early, but goddamn with high str that thing is mental.
[2022-12-24 08:00:38] <%AyeWho> @kronicc1, nah its too late, the game is full release

[2022-12-24 08:01:41] <dr_halsey_> i have heard almost every solo streamer saying its a different class that best for solo (mostly the class they play themself)
[2022-12-24 08:01:43] <Judgment_NA> This whole time i could just break a chest

[2022-12-24 08:02:42] <+HermitStew> and since the game is slower than most other games (more time for strategic where/when), this matters more

[2022-12-24 08:03:08] <iddqd> I think folks look at 10%hp extra talent and says “juicy”, but if you can close to 170-180hp, the value morale boost perk offers is nuts. 20hp heal per target killed? 👀

[2022-12-24 12:20:48] <%Trogderpinator> @Sequisha The crystal sword does physical and magical damage when hitting a target, so if you try it on the dummy you'll see 16 magical and like 12 physical. On top of that if you inflame your sword and run fire dmg perks, you can inflame the sword, haste, invis and kill a warrior in like 3 hits
[2022-12-24 12:21:09] <%+DayXP> are there even any cheaters?
[2022-12-24 12:21:14] <+Ubiquitination> @eemelinkiisseli yah report them on the DnD discord
