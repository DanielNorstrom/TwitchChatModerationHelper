[2022-12-24 05:56:30] <@%+Chaosshield> are they more clutch than a minute of invisibility and 20 free damage though
[2022-12-24 05:56:36] <@%+Chaosshield> that's the real question that matters
[2022-12-24 05:56:37] <zargki> i gotta say terrorising lubjansk and trying to break as many legs as i can has been the most fun ive had in dayz in a while
[2022-12-24 05:56:50] <+SausageFondue> is the map random every game?
[2022-12-24 05:57:01] <%KaiFawkes> i swear its better for us to stack strength other than agi for rogues

[2022-12-24 06:06:21] <@%+Chaosshield> rogue vs rogue is rough because you just butt heads and apply so much DoT that neither of you die before your DoT's guarantee both of your deaths

[2022-12-24 06:06:43] <@%+Chaosshield> the only way to get around it is to have a rapier and hit them with a throwing knife so they are hurt and you can start spacing early

[2022-12-24 06:35:40] <%namorsei> horseman axe can chunk hella head damage
[2022-12-24 06:35:42] <@%+Chaosshield> but the double axe really doesn't matter how good it is because it will be a 1 shot on everything

[2022-12-24 10:38:27] <Cheshired> @xXToxicWastedXx I mean... it'd be fun if it wasn't worse than just outright fighting people. It reveals you from stealth, takes 2-3 seconds of channeling and you can't move. Also steals a random item. I wish it was a rewarding skill for not being noticed but as it stands it's horrible.
