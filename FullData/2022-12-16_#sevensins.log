As a VOD watcher,  I'm often having trouble knowing "where" you are in the game in the fiesta.... Like how many hours are we in for that FF? It might have been already asked but is it possible to add a per game timer somewhere? Just so when someone like me try to catch you on the VOD, its kindda easiier to navigate? Thanks :D

[2022-12-16 13:32:11] <%lukastheblack> i had this discussion the other day with friend who's a middle manager yesterday. i come to work for work, stay out of my personal time
[2022-12-16 13:32:19] <7thSaga> looks like a Pokemon
[2022-12-16 13:32:24] <%Retaliator_NL> Haha, yeah. In honesty. a lot of people in the company I work for are outsourced. but still, it feels weird
[2022-12-16 13:32:36] <UncleCreepyy> D:
[2022-12-16 13:32:37] <%Retaliator_NL> Conflict of interest
[2022-12-16 13:32:40] <Azrazal> any chance that would have been on stream? i have searched a lot, and tried a lot. heard rumours of people getting cactuar early, but never any proof
