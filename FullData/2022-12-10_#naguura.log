[2022-12-10 00:55:56] <eternalwhitemoon> Honestly, for us, it's like, the low 40s (F) overcast with drizzle is wayyyy worse than -20
[2022-12-10 00:55:57] <+dmay93> Any crafted gear seem absolutely insane?

[2022-12-10 00:56:08] <eternalwhitemoon> there's a point where it's so cold it isn't cold anymore

[2022-12-10 01:18:22] <%+nicksazzels> made a ticket a blizz said cannot do anything go ask twitch, opened ticket at twitch they said only blizz can help. closed both tickets disapointed and got the mount like 5 minutes after
[2022-12-10 01:18:24] <%Ryuenjin> @Naguura I think the bigger issue is that when we've submitted tickets to blizzard they say "not our fault, talk to twitch" twitch says "not our fault, talk to blizzard"

[2022-12-10 01:20:18] <@%itsClubby> @skibbatv I literally said that and was informed its the same camera! LUL its the lighting
[2022-12-10 01:20:22] <shakeczn_> I would join, but camping for trial of elements :/
[2022-12-10 01:20:24] <+Aumora> probably the lighting as well, the room seems brighter than your stream room

[2022-12-10 01:20:32] <%+ROBKtv> i can dps if you need
[2022-12-10 01:20:32] <%gerryblue> they finally let you out of the cave thats probably why!
[2022-12-10 01:20:35] <%+eternalwhitemoon> I mean you're just pretty regardless of your camera--I wouldn't dare to show my face because I am essentially a trogg :)
[2022-12-10 01:20:36] <skibbatv> hell yeah!
[2022-12-10 01:20:40] <@%itsClubby> Its not the angle Naguura its the lighting

[2022-12-10 01:20:46] <UshinattaOmoide> Exited for next week ?
[2022-12-10 01:20:47] <+Coldflame23> Dutch angle
[2022-12-10 01:20:47] <Sceraphixx> maybe its the lighting too
[2022-12-10 01:20:47] <%+eternalwhitemoon> on the bright side, it means I get peace and quiet

[2022-12-10 01:21:10] <@%itsClubby> The room you're in is light as well
[2022-12-10 01:22:02] <astreinoid> probably because you can look down upon us much more easily with this angle LUL
[2022-12-10 01:22:02] <%tor4loll> who else is there? :D
[2022-12-10 01:22:03] <@%Kuroz> NOTED  is it anyone important or can you blind this person

[2022-12-10 02:08:02] <%+Luc1dDream> If this raid is anything like the last one, you'd have to pack every stitch of clothing you own to avoid laundry, and that still might not be enough!

[2022-12-10 02:10:39] <omg_me_2> what does "survive a reset" mean? the game??
[2022-12-10 02:11:14] <daftna> I'm guessing the raid itself is easy but since our ilvls are kinda low it might be a bit more of a gear race than a skill race
[2022-12-10 02:11:19] <+Fury__2003> raid will be 100% easier than Sepulchar
[2022-12-10 02:11:32] <+Fury__2003> but dont think it will be free loot for wf raiders
[2022-12-10 02:11:44] <hibber2222> thanks for the mount

[2022-12-10 02:12:24] <sionroberts> i think difficulty wise it will be a < day raid but early gearing time will mean it lives past the reset

[2022-12-10 02:33:33] <+dovahkiyn> you get knowledge by dirt farming which people already would be doing to grind rep
[2022-12-10 02:33:46] <nightelfgirl21> i got the pet
[2022-12-10 02:33:49] <Reloe> think what a lot of people don't know yet is that to craft basically ANY super endgame item at 418 you either need to recraft until inspiration proc, or the crafter uses an insight for 50 mettle which you would have to pay for then ofc
[2022-12-10 02:33:50] <%Billybobbs> Are you excited for PvP this season KEKW
[2022-12-10 02:33:51] <HairClog> Dirt farming?

[2022-12-10 04:18:35] <+sandtrap001> i'm trialing for my first CE guild next week. I play unholy but they already have two DKs. should I just switch to my demo lock and gear that instead?
[2022-12-10 04:18:38] <+bananman9000> yep
[2022-12-10 04:18:40] <+bananman9000> thats the temptation
[2022-12-10 04:18:45] <%+Neesknight> so, necklace? better?
[2022-12-10 04:18:48] <margomilo> which profession is your favorite so far?
[2022-12-10 04:18:51] <+Essenji> I wouldn't use sparks for it though
[2022-12-10 04:18:53] <+HellNoH20> it's a poorly designed system when the best option is to not even engage with it right now.

[2022-12-10 04:42:12] <%jasenelle> where/how do you get the missives?
[2022-12-10 04:42:24] <%Vile_> Oh, well -- you're in LA, good evening KEKW

[2022-12-10 04:42:39] <samopipari> Santa Sam O here, i wonder how many kids are getting WoW Dragonflight or someother WoW stuff under the tree?
[2022-12-10 04:42:49] <+cDorkk> Missive stays the same when recrafting
[2022-12-10 04:43:09] <+gravlaxxx> how do the crafted ring and necks stack up against raid / m+
[2022-12-10 04:43:18] <PapaSaxobeats> can crafting ilvl be as high as raid lot ilvl now?
[2022-12-10 04:43:39] <+bananman9000> it also helps you to not worry about skill/quality on initiial craft because you can always upgrade quality realitvely easily
[2022-12-10 04:43:42] <threeslotbag> finishing reagent is one time use
[2022-12-10 04:43:45] <+Kojobaby> yes it gets used up
[2022-12-10 04:43:47] <toobke> you have to use one each time
[2022-12-10 04:44:20] <+deelay91> any ideas what to do about vanishing dailies
[2022-12-10 04:44:22] <fREAKARNN> @Naguura do you get skill up from recrafting?
[2022-12-10 04:44:29] <LuckyLucker__> do you need to provide a new darkmoon card if you wanna recraft a darkmoon deckbox?

Others should have given as penalties, i.e. the one against Cavani. The VAR was created to assist the referee but corrupt FIFA uses it 2 stir the game how they want. Kane erred & England is out
