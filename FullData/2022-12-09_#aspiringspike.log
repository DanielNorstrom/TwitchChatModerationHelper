[2022-12-09 17:04:53] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card something less saucy. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is something less saucy. Thank You.

[2022-12-09 17:20:03] <%Ocara115> Magic is definitely highly luck based, assuming close to equal skill levels
[2022-12-09 17:20:04] <%davitodroid> there's luck in fighting games
[2022-12-09 17:20:05] <TimePhase> 99%

[2022-12-09 17:20:19] <rowrow_> @titanoclock 1 mana for a 10/10 is nothing with the aid. If Sigarda's aid was more aggressively costed, it'd be fair
[2022-12-09 17:20:20] <%HugHeist> just make your own luck (cheat)
[2022-12-09 17:20:23] <Armater> @davitodroid how
[2022-12-09 17:20:26] <mtg_cribbs> Since the best magic players have a 65% win rate, magic is probably 30% luck

[2022-12-09 17:20:32] VIEWERS: 1 026
[2022-12-09 17:20:33] <%+deadpool646> If the best players win rates are around 70% then I’d say magic is 30% luck
[2022-12-09 17:20:42] <OutKaste> There’s more luck in card games over fighting game, but there is a ton of luck in Fighting games.
[2022-12-09 17:20:42] <%+Heisenb3rg96> % luck vs skill is a non-sense statement without a time variable
[2022-12-09 17:20:44] <+the_mruniverse> if we didn't like luck in Magic we would simply play chess

[2022-12-09 17:57:24] <+gwdinosaurs> they intentionally didnt add it cause they thought it would be op with heliod in historic, and it's not in pioneer anyway so why add
[2022-12-09 17:57:28] <OutKaste> Oh ballista is not.

[2022-12-09 18:03:38] <BigKatsBrew> Have we brewed a Pioneer version of the Sarinth Steelshaper deck? It seems like the RG legend that is an Urza for nontoken artifacts could be a good pair for the card.

[2022-12-09 18:04:21] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> So we;ve decided the card you're looking for is Beledros Witherbloom?
[2022-12-09 18:04:41] <+gwdinosaurs> ive been trying steelseeker in explorer and standard on arena and it can do some ok stuff but it isn't a build around without the modern food package
[2022-12-09 18:04:43] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Or prophet of kruphix, which doesn't untap immdiately but gives flash so it's like it immdiately untapped
