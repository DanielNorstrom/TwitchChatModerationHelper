[2023-01-03 17:09:09] <DesmondTutu_> so glad i dont have these problems. My prescription is wayyyy to expensive to extra glasses like that. also pretty sure i could get the same thing on my everyday pair.

[2023-01-03 17:30:07] <+VisibleSpark> it's a very different game solo, that's for sure
[2023-01-03 17:30:17] <iiAmAnt> way above avg
[2023-01-03 17:30:19] <%Vibrosis> solo seems nice since you can just shoot at everything you see :D
[2023-01-03 17:30:22] <+DannyMans> I think half the battle of getting better at this game is other knowledge.  Map Knowledge, play spawn knowledge, being able to identify sounds of guns and areas on the map
[2023-01-03 17:30:23] <Saimon_sk> i prefer solo cause you can do what you want

[2023-01-03 18:43:45] <%+illuminist619> guess as much as this game has cheaters like every other game    it also has a very high skill level of general players   so   not every dodgy kill is a cheater
[2023-01-03 18:43:54] <%Crawlern> Skill issue. just avoid bullets
