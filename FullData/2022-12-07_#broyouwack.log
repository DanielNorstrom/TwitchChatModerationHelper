[2022-12-07 18:11:23] <%rogue_entity> @mysteriousblaze05 2 hours for the spray and 4 additional hours for the Skin
[2022-12-07 18:11:27] <shamuscool> push is the best mode no cap
[2022-12-07 18:11:27] <+SirBlazzit> I've been watching since the stream started and only realised about 2 hours ago that you need to claim the first reward before starting progress on the 2nd one
[2022-12-07 18:11:35] <skeletors_sack> Oof
[2022-12-07 18:11:38] <zelzim_> @SirBlazzit OOF

[2022-12-07 18:12:16] <asta_454> push is good but the map desine kinda sucks

[2022-12-07 18:12:21] <nanobyte_1776> You just need a good team to play push
[2022-12-07 18:12:32] <+SirBlazzit> @SirBlazzit I watch anyway, so it's not really a problem, but damn, coulda had the Ramattra skin 4 hours ago

[2022-12-07 18:12:52] <TheNeonBot> push is fine a bit slow but coloseo is the WORST
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <MaverickHunter_X> Push is great...on paper. execution leaves a lot to be desired.
