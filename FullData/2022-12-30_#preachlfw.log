[2022-12-30 08:34:33] <%Zeroslayer> Bwop Good morning @bAssackward
[2022-12-30 08:50:42] <%Criptonix100> Bwop TeaTime
[2022-12-30 08:52:09] <%Zeroslayer> Bwop TeaTime
[2022-12-30 08:55:07] <%Criptonix100> people still play MH:W? maybe I should I buy it hmm
[2022-12-30 08:55:39] <%Zeroslayer> mhw is a great monster hunter game still Bwop
[2022-12-30 08:55:48] <%Zeroslayer> Arguably the best to start off with.
[2022-12-30 08:56:21] <%+Ajna_sg> Bwop
[2022-12-30 08:56:42] <%Criptonix100> well I played the OG PSO and my most beloved Phantasy Star series is the Universe series which inspired Monster Hunter KEKW
[2022-12-30 08:56:57] <%Criptonix100> so I know in what I am getting into
[2022-12-30 08:57:52] <%Criptonix100> the OG PSO didn't even had Photon Arts...good memories
[2022-12-30 08:58:53] <%Criptonix100> @Ajna_sg Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:01:29] <%Zeroslayer> Bwop @Ajna_sg

[2022-12-30 09:02:46] <%Criptonix100> Bwop Morning @Thelete

[2022-12-30 09:07:03] <%Zeroslayer> @MaehDraws @Thelete Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:08:05] <%Criptonix100> I bet MH:W is what PSO2 NGS wanted to be KEKL
[2022-12-30 09:08:41] <%bAssackward> KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:08:58] <%Zeroslayer> Oh it's much much more
[2022-12-30 09:09:10] <%Zeroslayer> I don't even wanna compare PSO2 NGS to anything.
[2022-12-30 09:09:29] <%phinci> Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:09:36] <%Zeroslayer> Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:10:39] <%Criptonix100> I kinda agree but we have to take into account that thanks to the gameplay PSO and popularity of PSU, Monster Hunter was created KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:11:01] <%Zeroslayer> True but not thanks to NGS KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:11:21] <%bAssackward> MHW and the expansion were incredible. I put over 2000 hours into playing it. ☺️
[2022-12-30 09:11:55] <%Zeroslayer> I have a friend that got the ps4 version just so he could play the expansion earlier and later bought it on steam as well.
[2022-12-30 09:12:14] <%Criptonix100> I'm buying it rn
[2022-12-30 09:12:16] <%bAssackward> I bought it on Steam too, to play with a different group of friends.
[2022-12-30 09:13:00] <%bAssackward> coxPog
[2022-12-30 09:13:02] <%Zeroslayer> MHW is the best start you can have to the series IMO. Rise is also good but I haven't played it through yet.
[2022-12-30 09:13:30] <%bAssackward> Rise is fun, but I liked World better.
[2022-12-30 09:13:48] <%Zeroslayer> Like I tried MH 3 on the wii u and it almost drove me away cus it was hard as shit to understand stuff.
[2022-12-30 09:14:04] <%Zeroslayer> @bAssackward So far I have the same impression.
[2022-12-30 09:15:07] <%Criptonix100> anyone planning to help me? or I'll go on my own KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:15:46] <%Zeroslayer> Eh you should be fine.
[2022-12-30 09:17:25] <%Zeroslayer> I only started learning about "advanced" stuff later on. You can go at your own pace till you reach high rank.
[2022-12-30 09:17:46] <%Zeroslayer> I think there's even some new starter armor you can craft/buy that help you out early on.
[2022-12-30 09:18:09] <%Zeroslayer> Also for good starter weapons without too much thinking. Sword & Shield or HAMMER Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:18:18] <%Zeroslayer> Seriously hammer is stupid fun.
[2022-12-30 09:18:36] <%Criptonix100> but I want a fast weapon Madge
[2022-12-30 09:18:50] <%Criptonix100> Switchaxe looks fun
[2022-12-30 09:18:51] <%Zeroslayer> Dual Swords work as well.
[2022-12-30 09:18:58] <%Zeroslayer> Oh yeah it is.
[2022-12-30 09:19:09] <%Zeroslayer> Never used it much in world but I'm using it in rise atm.
[2022-12-30 09:19:52] <%Zeroslayer> Once you get to high rank or when you reach a road block I'd advise you to watch a video about your weapon of choice as some weapon aren't exactly self explanatory.
[2022-12-30 09:20:07] <%Criptonix100> ok
[2022-12-30 09:20:49] <%Zeroslayer> But starting out you don't need to. And information overload could happen so that's why I don't recommend watching a video about stuff before you learn some stuff from the game first.
[2022-12-30 09:21:18] <%Zeroslayer> Oh yeah and remember to take the freebies from the chest at the start of every mission Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:21:45] <%Criptonix100> yeah I remember checking my chest everytime on the PSP MH
[2022-12-30 09:21:51] <%Zeroslayer> Probably the best thing about world is that gathering is super fast.
[2022-12-30 09:22:26] <%Zeroslayer> Any game before world took a while to gather stuff but in world you'll just pick up stuff on your way with little to no slowdown.
[2022-12-30 09:22:52] <%Criptonix100> hopefully my CPU and SSD wont melt with this insane download speed I got KEKL
[2022-12-30 09:22:55] <%Zeroslayer> And I guess just try out every weapon in the traning area.
[2022-12-30 09:23:43] <%Zeroslayer> Now world is a little demanding on the graphics side but hopefully it's still playable on your pc.
[2022-12-30 09:24:00] <%Criptonix100> I saw videos which is fine
[2022-12-30 09:24:18] <%Zeroslayer> Great Bwop
[2022-12-30 09:24:58] <%Medias> Madge TeaTime
[2022-12-30 09:25:01] <%Criptonix100> atleast it doesn't require 12 GB RAM minimum and with having linux...you know it's way less than Windows

[2022-12-30 09:25:27] <%Medias> @Zeroslayer Madge TeaTime
[2022-12-30 09:25:31] <%Zeroslayer> @Criptonix100 new world flashbacks KEKL
[2022-12-30 09:25:53] <%Criptonix100> also the minimum CPU is like current gen that I have but Ryzen 3 APU
[2022-12-30 09:26:05] <%ravenribb> Madge TeaTime
[2022-12-30 09:26:32] <%Zeroslayer> Seriously on windows during the beta new world used 10 gigs. And I've heard that in cities it requires more RAM than the steam deck can handle.
[2022-12-30 09:26:53] <%Zeroslayer> So... don't log out in a city if you plan to play New World on the steam deck KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:27:26] <%Criptonix100> what the actual fuck Bill Gates KEKW
[2022-12-30 09:27:41] <%Criptonix100> Now I understand why Gaben left Bill Gates
[2022-12-30 09:29:20] <%Criptonix100> even tho I am joking....wow Microsoft has went beyond creating a monster OS that requires 12 GB minimum ram for gaming KEKW

[2022-12-30 10:11:12] <bariumjones> @Ragnarskar eh its really only relevant if NA kills it on reset day or smthing. the thing with the nerf is though there's no good time to do it, its going to advantage one side or the other
[2022-12-30 10:11:15] <+Marcus___90> the roar adds a lot to your dps since you got increase bleed talent
[2022-12-30 10:11:17] <+tokyochicken> @tokyochicken the second boss on tyrannical also hurts for healers, i feel bad for them on that fight lol

[2022-12-30 10:11:25] <bariumjones> @Ragnarskar and if you just do nothing and let itemlevel/reset nerf the boss then it defaults to advantaging NA

[2022-12-30 11:21:32] <+Marcus___90> you need 10 +11 to get it to 405

[2022-12-30 11:21:39] <explicit_> you can upgrade it
[2022-12-30 11:21:47] <+grimwolfuk> the lariat is a BIS neck that is going for silly money pattern on the AH
[2022-12-30 11:21:47] <dhemizewow> big one is 16s (418)
[2022-12-30 11:21:51] <showgun92> special boat for special people
[2022-12-30 11:21:51] <%Quelten> and 10 +16 for 418
[2022-12-30 11:21:52] <Visuals66> did you use your primal infusion from Raz?
[2022-12-30 11:21:53] <thesagaofblitz> is this a dungeon?
[2022-12-30 11:21:53] <%Dragonnan> It's a crafted neck that procs secondary stats based on what gems you have in your gear
[2022-12-30 11:21:54] <+Breadmun> you should already have 6 from doing heroic
[2022-12-30 11:21:57] <HawtDaawwgg> juyst make it and upgrade later
[2022-12-30 11:22:01] <+N3llee> any plans for a RWF in review?
[2022-12-30 11:22:03] <LotusGT> @Marcus___90 No its a neck with a really good embelishment. The three sockets are from Tiered item that applies them.
[2022-12-30 11:22:04] <thesagaofblitz> wow has dungeons with boats? cool
[2022-12-30 11:22:06] <settejo> @Marcus___90 lariat is actually only 1 socket, you just use a thingy twice to add 2 more which you can do on any neck
[2022-12-30 11:22:12] <Jarlan23> any neck at all or does it need to be crafted
[2022-12-30 11:22:20] <bariumjones> i have a tier 2 prismatic in my lariat PepeLaugh
[2022-12-30 11:22:22] <iamsolarfri> Legacy M+ is so good
[2022-12-30 11:22:22] <colossalFISH> the food embellishment is so good. food lasts through death and 2 hour duration Pog
[2022-12-30 11:22:27] <%blainyy> That's how you deal with slow classes
[2022-12-30 11:22:31] <VIEGAS_PT> this dungeon was always a pain
[2022-12-30 11:22:31] <+Prodigo> @bariumjones I've tried all 3 specs and 3 different classes, It's just too repetitive to me. I enjoy raiding though
[2022-12-30 11:22:34] <thesagaofblitz> this is really creative. wish ffxiv would steal this idea

[2022-12-30 11:49:00] <RJNiemela> @morgott21 It is best for tonk wars as well
[2022-12-30 11:49:06] <+Marcus___90> catalyst in few weeks dont worry about tier slots
[2022-12-30 11:49:07] <hammertofall> Do 16s then spend on 1h and shield probably the play

[2022-12-30 11:49:13] <Jarlan23> @RJNiemela ya but the extra auto attack is so little at least that what it seems like to me
[2022-12-30 11:49:15] <+rohdey> @Preachlfw don't forget about REcrafting to upgrade your crafted gear
[2022-12-30 11:49:24] <Woogiefan> well yeah lariat is bis for everything
[2022-12-30 11:49:25] <%$chris_babaganoosh05> You can turn it into tier in a few weeks so it's not a huge deal

[2022-12-30 11:49:30] <Arvediu> playing without lariat is trolling a bit ngl

[2022-12-30 12:01:15] <+bound006> how does it work with the goals here?
[2022-12-30 12:01:37] <+Asasination23> 1 goal gives a 75% damage increase to boss, the other gives a haste buff
[2022-12-30 12:01:38] <Jarlan23> this boss can be annoying with everything up and thunder comes to punch you in the balls
[2022-12-30 12:01:46] <Saitouakira> @bound006 you pick 3 orbs which you throw into either fire =more damage to boss for a while or wind which is more haste

[2022-12-30 12:01:58] <%+Madelion> 3 in the fire goal stuns the boss and it takes bonus damage, but adds the red swirls. 3 in the air goal turns on the windows, but also drops some extra balls that give you bonus haste and immunity to wind
[2022-12-30 12:02:10] <%RJNiemela> Stick close and all's good

[2022-12-30 13:42:33] <ryphos> 6.3 is going to be different from other .3 patches though since endwalker's story wrapped up in 6.0

[2022-12-30 14:30:51] <+Titan_Creed> Chat bubbles would likely only get implemented if JP players could prevent their sent words from becoming bubbles.
[2022-12-30 14:30:52] <%+Andrewsx> as other said, shout chat isn't really a thing in japan culture
[2022-12-30 14:30:52] <%+vikwax> my  guess is spam

[2022-12-30 14:30:56] <dirtylevel> they have chat bubbles for NPCs
[2022-12-30 14:30:57] <ZodaSoda> I would imagine they dont like chat bubbles being used in raids like wow does

[2022-12-30 14:31:21] <%turtleandfish> JPN culture says chat bubbles are intrusive apparently
[2022-12-30 14:31:22] <+thaun1> RMT chat bubbles

[2022-12-30 14:31:28] <%+Supersenkel> You can probably add options whose messages you see
[2022-12-30 14:31:28] <Riyshn> There's already 2 bosses in the game that specifically use chat bubbles as part of their mechanics. That's already a thing
[2022-12-30 14:31:30] <%luchael> it always boils down to console players smh
[2022-12-30 14:31:30] <chiropteria> might be spamming reasons - but you could add a filter like the mod has already
[2022-12-30 14:31:33] <ponsense> they could just make chat bubbles off by default if spam was a problem
[2022-12-30 14:31:33] <Tobloo> You could macro stuff to chat bubbles, maybe
[2022-12-30 14:31:34] <+AtachiHayashime> boss mods is no reason... those that would use it can use bubbles already anyways

[2022-12-30 14:31:57] <%Tahantos> disable in duties to avoid exploit

[2022-12-30 14:36:26] <%w061a09> pld is only weak against tb otherwise its giga tanky beard
[2022-12-30 14:36:29] <%+Reiyayru> Damn, just woke up. How much did I miss
[2022-12-30 14:36:29] <kamuiks> while they removed a flavor spell for pld, I don't see why it's bad aside from that since the dot does not add anything to the gameplay (no interaction with it and it's detrimental to their 2mn burst windows I guess?)
[2022-12-30 14:36:30] <+Judders__> pld also couldn't really mitigate dots on themselves since block didnt lower dot damage
[2022-12-30 14:36:32] <%+Chitalian> 4Head just increase the limit
[2022-12-30 14:36:33] <Furtbute> I only know how to Fell Cleave

[2022-12-30 14:36:51] <Riyshn> wish SE would admit they've designed themselves into a corner by forcing every job into the 2min cycle. They even said pre-EW that there were intentionally leaving some jobs desynced from it, then backtracked :(
[2022-12-30 14:36:54] <%disastradoom> plz lose bard dots
[2022-12-30 14:36:55] <%disastradoom> plz

[2022-12-30 14:37:02] <SanosukeArg> @Andrewsx Nope, 7.0 will have only AST and DRG reworks
[2022-12-30 14:37:14] <+JP11999> @fordytheonly unfortunately they are more squishy because their shield is useless vs crit and bleed. which is like most mechs in endwalker

[2022-12-30 14:37:17] <+Cubick23> bard dots are good

[2022-12-30 14:37:23] <hinaxiv> @SirBowlsworth what why. dots dont do anything anymore for bard. only thing is you press jaws every  40 seconds or so lol
[2022-12-30 14:37:23] <+Cubick23> i want a dot mage
[2022-12-30 14:37:24] <+Sluggs_> @SirBowlsworth tehy removed their dots from proccing their songs they are just ticking damage now

[2022-12-30 14:37:29] <%ravenribb> @Preachlfw PLD could fit into 2 min CD, but they needed like 25 sec pull timer xD

[2022-12-30 14:37:36] <Enyalios121> Bard doesn’t need a rework, it needs very minor changes. Like apex arrow being ocgd and more akin to bavahkakra

[2022-12-30 14:37:38] <Lalikus> I dont like the 2 min window, its too long. I'd rather have it on 1:30 or 1 minute

[2022-12-30 14:38:14] <%+LikChan> Gladiator story makes up for it
[2022-12-30 14:38:17] <%Koppakamarin> Great content LUL

[2022-12-30 14:38:22] <StreamBonker> @Preachlfw PLD Story is almost as bad as shadowlands
[2022-12-30 14:38:23] <DoubleA5012> Gladiator has an okay story, paladin is kind of lame.
[2022-12-30 14:38:26] <%ravenribb> PLD
[2022-12-30 14:38:28] <+Titan_Creed> The Gladiator part is fun at least.

[2022-12-30 14:39:06] <Nemm__> Warrior Story is also pretty "eh" in spots
[2022-12-30 14:39:07] <%+lemonadebeer> Ivalice is giga bad imo
[2022-12-30 14:39:15] <+Prodigo> the warrior love story is funny af what are you guys talking about

[2022-12-30 14:39:27] <%MaehDraws> It's honestly not that bad
[2022-12-30 14:39:28] <%darlec82> It’s not that bad it’s just the other job stories are so much better so it’s lacking in comparison
[2022-12-30 14:39:28] <%+Reiyayru> I actually did enjoy the last part of the PLD story a bit. The last cutscene is awesome with various glamour

[2022-12-30 14:41:12] <Phaezen> the gladiator bits are good, but the PLD is objectively bad

[2022-12-30 14:41:25] <notlongtillDawn> They shouldn’t have named the job paladin. Story makes more sense if the job was knight.

[2022-12-30 15:16:39] <EndingWonderland> no splits
[2022-12-30 15:16:41] <Astrea_Love_1> DSR was fun to watch imo.
[2022-12-30 15:16:44] <%+Landmine667> savage is better?
[2022-12-30 15:16:44] <%Medias> DSR was great as a Viewer but it's too difficult for a big show
[2022-12-30 15:16:44] <Narrek_> ah yes worse than splits

[2022-12-30 15:18:14] <flyingjalopy> It's the same issue pinball tournaments have.  the hardcore fans (like me) will watch 8-12 hours of pinball matches, but it's pretty hard to make it interesting to non-pinball players

[2022-12-30 15:46:06] <%Vinestra28> @IamTheRealDante Shame its not 191 -200
[2022-12-30 15:46:10] <Tsubodaii> blm hurts my eyes
[2022-12-30 15:46:15] <Narnun> yes machinist is the easiest one
[2022-12-30 15:46:20] <sethbearz> picture a warrior with big dick life steal just breezing through this
[2022-12-30 15:46:20] <%+Penitente12> 171 is where it starts getting brutally dangerous solo
[2022-12-30 15:46:20] <SanosukeArg> @GrungyCoffee MCH is BiS for single player runs in PotD
[2022-12-30 15:46:22] <7Sevyne7> Angelus is a beast in Deep Dungeons. Plays only using keyboard too.
[2022-12-30 15:46:27] <%IamTheRealDante> @IamTheRealDante technically 171-180 is the hardest
[2022-12-30 15:46:27] <%smatthew_> @GrungyCoffee Probably more then ever after buffs. RDM is the other good one
[2022-12-30 15:46:28] <%+MetatronM> the GDQ run is POTD 171-180 MCH solo
[2022-12-30 15:46:29] <sentinel_of_silence> @GrungyCoffee yes, it's even got stronger there after buffs
[2022-12-30 15:46:33] <Narnun> mch or rdm but machinist is the easiest to do solo
[2022-12-30 15:46:38] <+Peljack> U can hide map and poms
[2022-12-30 15:46:40] <%+Supersenkel> Imagine they are modding the UI and get banned afterwards LUL
[2022-12-30 15:46:45] <%+Boomslang552> WAR is a good option now as well
[2022-12-30 15:46:45] <%+LikChan> WAR is also good but not the fastest

[2022-12-30 15:47:46] <Lyssa_Little_Bear> I've seen some of his trial runs (where he is basically doing his AGDQ presentation with his co-presenter) and Angelus is amazing at explaining things for non-ffxiv folks @preachlfw
[2022-12-30 15:47:53] <%Chichen> thats not how palace works
[2022-12-30 15:47:53] <%ower8x> @GrungyCoffee what about HoH?
[2022-12-30 15:48:01] <+Viminal> higher floors would be impossible then
[2022-12-30 15:48:03] <Narnun> this seems easy if u are new but solo 200 floors, necromancer title, is the hardest achivement imo
[2022-12-30 15:48:12] <+Peljack> It's boss every 10 floors, F10, 20, 30 etc
[2022-12-30 15:48:12] <+RedPandaZak> No mob linking in DD
[2022-12-30 15:48:12] <%Chichen> nope.
[2022-12-30 15:48:15] <%Chichen> you can single pull stuff
[2022-12-30 15:48:18] <%Vauche> Deep Dungeon mobs usually aren't chained, otherwise they'd be a nightmare solo
[2022-12-30 15:48:19] <+RedPandaZak> it would make it all but impossible to solo at high floors
[2022-12-30 15:48:21] <%+Boomslang552> @GrungyCoffee Tanks crush HoH
[2022-12-30 15:48:25] <%ravenribb> @Preachlfw if you hover over mobs you'll see a like between if they chain
[2022-12-30 15:48:27] <+Viminal> potd anzus xdd
[2022-12-30 15:48:28] <+IcySkittle> if they are chained they have a tether
[2022-12-30 15:48:28] <%IamTheRealDante> No mobs are chained to help solo players @Preachlfw
[2022-12-30 15:48:29] <%ravenribb> line*
[2022-12-30 15:48:29] <7Sevyne7> Nah. Deep dungeon has no mob links. Just different ways each aggro.
