[2022-12-06 00:00:11] <@%NautAJerman> it changes the pokemons normal ability
[2022-12-06 00:00:19] <+Hermysko> @ChairWithGun its 12 euro on steam foxyjoComfy
[2022-12-06 00:00:21] <@%NautAJerman> you just cant change it to a Hidden Ability
[2022-12-06 00:00:32] <%KaiSakurai> if a pokemon has 2 different abilities (not hidden) it changes it

[2022-12-06 00:00:46] <%KaiSakurai> ability patch changes it to the hidden ability
[2022-12-06 00:00:47] <yaebidjolten> no it changes a pokemons to other ability it has or hidden ability

[2022-12-06 00:01:16] <%KaiSakurai> im not a competitive player either

[2022-12-06 00:01:53] <%KaiSakurai> @yaebidjolten no for hidden ability u need ability patch not capsule

[2022-12-06 00:02:05] <%snpdrag0n> @chairwithgun 10.33 pound according to Google
[2022-12-06 00:02:05] <White_Blaze> ya some pokes have two normal abilities. like ponyta has flash fire Or run away, i forget what its hidden ability is BUT, the capsle would let you change the ability from run away to flash fire. being immuned to fire attacks and getting a stat boost when hit by them is much better then always being able to flee. lol
[2022-12-06 00:02:07] <+Hermysko> @ChairWithGun Probably 10 pounds I think

[2022-12-06 00:34:12] <%koleracaput> There's an urban legend going around, that American chocolate, Hershey's especially, has a really foul after taste resembling that of vomit, which is caused because they can contain butyric acid as a sort of filler ingredient.

[2022-12-06 19:38:28] <%+Uncle_Gaping> They were a massive species called Korks who were 12ft-30ft tall highly advanced
[2022-12-06 19:38:47] <%+Uncle_Gaping> They grow non-stop
[2022-12-06 19:39:27] <%+Uncle_Gaping> So Orks use the power of the Warp and the Chaos to believe it so their beliefs make it real
[2022-12-06 19:39:29] <%$JaywalkerN49> there is a hilarious scene in one of the novels where the imperial guard runs out of ammo and they start shouting gun noises, and since what enough Orks believe becomes reality, the Orks start taking gunshot wounds they believe the enemy fire should inflict

[2022-12-06 23:43:10] <itsaysTRUENO> jokes also use the rule of 3. lets you establish a pattern and then break it
[2022-12-06 23:43:12] <Shizounu> The rule of 3 also shows up in game design. Often you can repeat things 3 times before it becomes too boring, such as "pass the ball 3 times" or "do 3 waves"
