[2022-12-18 23:14:14] <%$Frayzr> the only paranormal experience i had was when i was 13 and me and my friend went into and abonded building, and we opened the window on the second floor. everything was fine on that floor besised from random wrsitbands with peoples names on it. but then we decided to go down the stairs where the windows were blacked out, and when we went into a large room it went noticeably cold, then we heard what sounded like a wheel squeaking, like a wheelchair kinda thing, and we bolted outta there real fast
