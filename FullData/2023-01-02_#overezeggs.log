[2023-01-02 04:11:53] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> @nemafow number Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850. Within that range, scores can usually be placed into one of five categories: poor, fair, good, very good and excellent.

[2023-01-02 04:43:33] <%+thetacoman14> trucks should have a MIN 300 mile range fully loaded. 600+ unloaded.
[2023-01-02 04:43:35] <%JBookwyrm> If  could get one for 36k I'd buy one to commute because we've got free charging at work
[2023-01-02 04:43:35] <%Flamebunnyy> EVs currently are really only good for short, routine trips
[2023-01-02 04:44:23] <%MoltenNami> they clearly released just because they wanted to get the cash from "real electric truck 😱" even though they know damn well it wasn't actually ready to live on
[2023-01-02 04:44:38] <omega_bunny> I would assume you'd be spending a reasonable time in the city if you're going that far though, which means you should be able to charge it while there?
[2023-01-02 04:44:44] <%AmusedBenga1> @thetacoman14 literally no vehicle in the world gets 600+ miles on a full tank/full charge

[2023-01-02 04:46:34] <%$fwpx> friend of mine has a plug in hybrid mini van, goes like 40 miles on battery before it switches to gas, pretty cool
[2023-01-02 04:46:42] <%+thetacoman14> @AmusedBenga1 battery cells are getting better and with a truck having a longer frame and thus more room for batteries it should acceptable to expect that in the future. currently no not a common thing to seek

[2023-01-02 04:46:53] <!%Old_Padfoot> I think they should focus on in city travel for now anyway. Get that tech and infrastructure set up, get all the government vehicles electric, and let it spread from there.
[2023-01-02 04:46:53] <%MoltenNami> that truck design runs on the assumption that almost everywhere you go will have a charger to sit at but electric cars are still too niche for that to be realistic

[2023-01-02 04:49:49] <%ashen_wings> YES! Exactly! if we could have modular battery packs (used across multiple brands) that could be swapped out at truck stops.
[2023-01-02 04:49:55] <%JBookwyrm> It works for forklifts... they make lifts specifically to swap batteries so it could work if a standard size was created

[2023-01-02 04:51:08] <%AmusedBenga1> @AmusedBenga1 Well. Yeah. I can understand the fact that they should add more batteries. but. that also decreases the overall efficiency of the batteries the more you put in.

[2023-01-02 04:52:33] <!%CoopKaiju> @old_padfoot It is the same for battery operated, but of all the infrastructures that we are investing into, flex fuel would have been smoother than electric

[2023-01-02 04:52:34] <!%Touchthesky8> Another possible option would be to really crank up the battery life so that the 20 hour charging wouldn't be that significant

I got RLCraft to run after 2 hours of work and avoiding malware installs, and for the finishing touch I went to download a shaders pack. Then I made the fucky wucky and clicked the wrong link. Total windows wipe and reinstall just finished, and it works fine now. Moral of the story, double check EVERY step of mod installations with youtube or reddit or something.

[2023-01-02 10:27:41] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> this song also came out back when people weren't gay, and a girl kissing another girl was simply a fetish for the enjoyment of men around them

[2023-01-02 15:32:41] <@%SethwMad> ONE OTHER THING
[2023-01-02 15:32:50] <%$nemafow> It depends if only 5 people are gonna get a copy
[2023-01-02 15:32:51] <@%SethwMad> Evergreen has more size options, framing, etc.
[2023-01-02 15:32:52] <%$the_vowki> quality
[2023-01-02 15:32:55] <%$the_vowki> 100%
[2023-01-02 15:32:59] <%haiddon> limited runs sounds better from that
[2023-01-02 15:32:59] <%$nemafow> Because there is more than 5 people who want them
[2023-01-02 15:32:59] <@%SethwMad> All that would come FROM the evergreen sidec
[2023-01-02 15:33:00] VIEWERS: 324
[2023-01-02 15:33:09] <%MediumBreeze> Quality probably better than quanitity depending on how much is printed
[2023-01-02 15:33:10] <!%+operatorviera> Limited runs that you can rerun later if demand is there
[2023-01-02 15:33:23] <%hunter_hues> i think limited since the ppl that want em will try and get em, and evergreen the ppl that want em wont be buying the same thing multiple times right
[2023-01-02 15:33:24] <@%SethwMad> Limited run would be most of the time just the art in whatever material we aim for.
[2023-01-02 15:33:33] <@%SethwMad> BUT
[2023-01-02 15:33:35] <@%SethwMad> THEY WOULD BANG

[2023-01-02 15:34:09] <%hunter_hues> that sounds smart
[2023-01-02 15:34:20] <@%SethwMad> We'd need to do a pre-order for that as well
[2023-01-02 15:34:31] <%hunter_hues> we can put them in our own jars
[2023-01-02 15:34:32] <@%SethwMad> So there would also be SOME shipping difference

[2023-01-02 20:26:47] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> question: would it be that much of a hassle to setup a basic OBS install so you could try to stream on it and see if it has less issues just for troubleshooting?
[2023-01-02 20:26:52] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> obv not right now
[2023-01-02 20:26:56] <%+chipsenpaiuwu> get some rest Egg, hopefully later twitch will be unfucked
[2023-01-02 20:26:57] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> but at some point
[2023-01-02 20:26:58] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> yeah, really annoying until it stops
[2023-01-02 20:27:01] <%Cloudyak> Have a good break and thanks for streaming if you sleep
[2023-01-02 20:27:01] <!%$CoopKaiju> Super sad that this is happening. Now shade on taking a break, we’ll see you when you next get back online
[2023-01-02 20:27:17] <%ashen_wings> slicing the VOD into a bunch of pieces is a royal pain
