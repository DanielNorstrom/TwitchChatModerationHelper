[2022-12-15 17:19:31] <%+Collector_bLAZE> new class seems pretty decent in PvE btw, got a decent Infinite Combo with 4 Debuffs while also giving me +20 AP and that without Addons
[2022-12-15 17:19:36] <Rarza> the evidence is; check her gear and ask for hours at Padix.
[2022-12-15 17:19:43] <Rarza> put 2 and 2 together

[2022-12-15 18:02:44] <+istakithelord> I liked kuno, but idk, it lacked attack moves, it just didn't feel that good idk
[2022-12-15 18:03:50] <%+Collector_bLAZE> Apparently Kuno is okayish, still high APM not as hard as Ninja, but also a bit less rewarding but more chill and safer for a lot of spots apparently

[2022-12-15 18:05:00] <%+Collector_bLAZE> yes Kuno needs overall more skills, but less APM and she cant really compete against ninja on equal skill in PvE
[2022-12-15 18:05:11] <%+Collector_bLAZE> but shes more defensive and safer from her playstyle
