[2023-01-04 00:31:45] <@%OlleeW> FromSoftware's Demon's Souls (2009) emphasized unforgiving enemies and environments, combined with risk-and-reward mechanics such as limited checkpoints, collecting "souls" that can be consumed as experience points to increase the player's stats, or as a currency to purchase items, and penalizing player deaths without imposing an outright failure state. It also incorporated online features allowing players to leave messages in the overworld that can be read by other players, to temporarily join
[2023-01-04 00:31:46] <@%OlleeW> other players' sessions to assist them cooperatively, or "invade" another player's session to engage in player versus player combat. Especially after the release of its spiritual successor Dark Souls (2011) and its sequels, other action RPGs emerged in the 2010s that incorporated mechanics influenced by those of Demon's Souls, which have been popularly referred to as "Soulslike" games.

[2023-01-04 00:49:41] <%Chillaximus> OlleeW Stare it's so good though
[2023-01-04 00:49:58] <@%OlleeW> 10k and fear is better
[2023-01-04 00:50:05] <%Chillaximus> 10k yes
[2023-01-04 00:50:11] <%Chillaximus> as a whole album
[2023-01-04 00:50:15] <$meursault_> noidontthinkso
[2023-01-04 00:50:27] <$meursault_> lateralus > 10k days
[2023-01-04 00:50:52] <@%OlleeW> whatever, the style of the songs are different on lateralus and I dont vibe with them the same way
[2023-01-04 00:50:53] <@%OlleeW> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2023-01-04 00:50:54] <%Chillaximus> not for me but both are better than fear cum
[2023-01-04 00:51:18] <%Chillaximus> 10k is the best whole album but lateralus has higher peaks
[2023-01-04 00:51:20] <Pogba> elinaSit
[2023-01-04 00:51:25] <$meursault_> nymnWow
[2023-01-04 00:52:26] <@%OlleeW> lateralus doesnt peak anywhere for me
[2023-01-04 00:53:14] <%Chillaximus> schism, parabol+parabola
[2023-01-04 00:53:23] <%Chillaximus> title track is in contention for my favorite track
[2023-01-04 00:53:40] <@%OlleeW> parabola is not a hit for me
[2023-01-04 00:53:47] <@%OlleeW> filler for me
[2023-01-04 00:53:52] <%Chillaximus> well you're wrong
[2023-01-04 00:54:12] <%Chillaximus> objectively bad at listening to music
[2023-01-04 00:54:23] <%Chillaximus> nymnUm
[2023-01-04 00:54:49] <@%OlleeW> I like the guitar on for example vicarious much more
[2023-01-04 00:54:56] <@%OlleeW> and I like his vocals more on 10k days
[2023-01-04 00:55:16] <%Chillaximus> 10k has nothing but bangers

[2023-01-04 11:51:00] <@%^botbear1110> Joshlad,  Hump day is a colloquial term for Wednesday, which is the middle of the work week. It is often used to refer to the feeling of making it over the "hump" of the week and being closer to the weekend.

[2023-01-04 12:13:47] <Phant0mBlades> bb ask why is life so despair
[2023-01-04 12:13:56] <@%^botbear1110> Phant0mBlades,  Life can be difficult and filled with despair at times, but it can also be filled with joy and hope. It is important to remember that life is a journey and that there will be ups and downs along the way. It is important to focus on the positive aspects of life and to find ways to cope with the difficult times.

[2023-01-04 12:40:54] <@%^botbear1110> QuisL,  The best part about Switzerland is its stunning natural beauty. From the majestic Alps to the picturesque lakes and rivers, Switzerland is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. Additionally, Switzerland is known for its high quality of life, excellent infrastructure, and efficient public transportation system.

[2023-01-04 12:49:21] <@%^botbear1110> QuisL,  Investing into crypto scams can be extremely risky and there are no real benefits to doing so. It is important to remember that crypto scams are designed to take advantage of unsuspecting investors and can result in significant financial losses. It is best to avoid investing in any crypto scams and to do your research before investing in any cryptocurrency.

They obtain energy from the breakdown of complex organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. They also require essential minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to grow and reproduce.

[2023-01-04 13:59:13] <@%^botbear1110> EzBorisee,  A jimmie is a slang term for a feather or a small stick used to tickle someone. The phrase "rustles my jimmies" is used to express annoyance or displeasure.

[2023-01-04 15:44:23] <%Andyleroi> bb ask is there a gene that makes you more susceptible to cuteness?
[2023-01-04 15:44:32] <@%^botbear1110> Andyleroi,  There is no known gene that makes someone more susceptible to cuteness. However, research has shown that certain hormones, such as oxytocin, can influence how people respond to cuteness. Oxytocin is known to increase feelings of trust and bonding, which could make someone more likely to respond positively to cuteness.

[2023-01-04 16:01:25] <Phant0mBlades> bb ask is there any specific reason on why Nymn is ditching his stream quite a while in the Year 2023
[2023-01-04 16:01:35] <@%^botbear1110> Phant0mBlades,  It is not clear why Nymn is ditching his stream in the Year 2023. It could be for personal reasons, such as wanting to focus on other projects or to take a break from streaming. It could also be due to changes in the streaming industry, such as new platforms or changes in the way streaming works. Ultimately, only Nymn knows the reason for his decision.

[2023-01-04 16:04:26] <@%^botbear1110> Infinityvy,  I think the new live streaming service Kick from Trains is a great idea. It provides an easy and convenient way for people to watch their favorite shows and movies on the go. The quality of the streaming is also very good, so it's a great way to stay entertained while traveling.

[2023-01-04 18:13:23] <@%^botbear1110> Fawcan,  NinjaBrain Bot is a Minecraft bot that can be used to automate various tasks in the game. It can be used to build structures, mine resources, craft items, and more. It can also be used to automate combat, allowing players to fight mobs without having to manually control their character.

[2023-01-04 19:56:59] <@%^botbear1110> CheyFun,  It is possible that you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed, which can lead to difficulty concentrating and feeling like your brain is empty. It is also possible that you are not getting enough sleep or that you are not engaging in activities that stimulate your brain. Try to take some time to relax and engage in activities that you enjoy, such as reading, writing, or doing puzzles.

[2023-01-04 21:24:32] <@%^botbear1110> Rexinus1,  It is difficult to estimate how much of the human population knows about the existence of Finnish salmiakki. However, it is likely that the majority of people outside of Finland are unaware of its existence.
