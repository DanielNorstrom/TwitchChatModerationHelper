[2022-12-21 18:04:54] <%pidesquare> Really not trying to start shit. I guess my question is why have two slightly different maps for the top tier of players and then the tier that is just slightly below them in terms of skill. are the "hard" maps that much harder?
[2022-12-21 18:05:02] <iwVerve> @C00ki3x pretty sure it's on YT

[2022-12-21 18:06:15] <iwVerve> @pidesquare yes, the gap is ultimately still pretty big between the maps. Since these are for races, you need to be consistent at the maps, and that's a very high bar especially for the hard version

[2022-12-21 21:21:05] <OhLindor> add like 1 or 2 minutes per 100 players
[2022-12-21 21:21:10] <%Groger12> Or just longer overtime for all servers?
[2022-12-21 21:21:10] <%+luckerjc> The leaderboard updated i think
[2022-12-21 21:21:24] <%pidesquare> just do 64 per server. lowers the gap
[2022-12-21 21:21:34] <moonshadowo> 100 is too much imo
[2022-12-21 21:21:38] <Magpie_AI> particularly in endurance where its about not crashing
