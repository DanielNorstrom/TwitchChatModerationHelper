I'm a Zen main and I think I deserve GM-Top 500. I'm currently Diamond, I rarely lose games unless none of my randoms are in team chat, which happens to be a lot. I definitely want to be able to play in contenders by the end of next year and if I somehow can't compete with GM's then that experience would allow me to learn more about OW.

[2022-12-20 01:45:42] <%Valknaz> I‚Äôm a really good Overwatch player but the enemy Hog is just better. I hit all my heals, perfectly manage my abilities, and my ults are immaculate. If I had any interest in it, I could have gone pro. But I gotta tip my hat to the enemy Hog as he just walks up and hooks me across the map. ‚ÄúThat was a nice hook‚Äù I say, as I walk back from spawn.

[2022-12-20 01:46:31] <BruceLeesCousin> Actually, if you go to your settings on the twitch app, you can find drops and inventory and you can find what is going and see the progress. It just isn't the same layout as the browser one.

[2022-12-20 15:33:56] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-20 18:46:38] <%MelBuggin> is this like some northerner thing?
[2022-12-20 18:46:39] <%MEGgerz802> no, sour cream donuts are "cake" donuts with a different type of glaze.
[2022-12-20 18:46:43] <%0fficer_toaster> Its a different type of glaze topping, its actually pretty good
[2022-12-20 18:46:44] <MrMooshy_> is it made with sour dough?
[2022-12-20 18:46:46] <%+joprojk> Different glaze
[2022-12-20 18:46:47] <%+Eragon_Cola> well its different than a normal glazed doghnut
[2022-12-20 18:46:47] <ChristianSharkTV> Most cake donuts at Dunkin‚Äô have sour cream in the batter @emongg

[2022-12-20 18:46:51] <%+tm_901> i dont think a normal glazed donut is a sour cream donut, never heard that before
[2022-12-20 18:46:51] <Kildain82> Yes, they just use sour cream instead of milk in the donut, but it's usually like a plain glazed donut
[2022-12-20 18:46:53] <LizOpTwitch> It looks like a churro when I look it up LUL
[2022-12-20 18:46:54] <%+Eragon_Cola> different type of glazing

[2022-12-20 18:47:10] <aruac> axeumBlush
[2022-12-20 18:47:11] <Taw_> Sour Cream donuts have sour cream added to the dough itself iirc. It changes the consistency of the donut.
[2022-12-20 18:47:11] <ChristianSharkTV> Yeah exactly
[2022-12-20 18:47:13] <%MelBuggin> blueberry cake donut is a good donut

[2022-12-20 18:47:36] <Color__Orange> not all donuts are sour cream donuts but all sour cream donuts are donuts....just like how all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares
[2022-12-20 18:47:38] <%MelBuggin> I want to know what region of the world calls cake donuts "sour cream" donuts.
[2022-12-20 18:47:47] <xaldelphix> @uncljed outta pocket with that one
[2022-12-20 18:47:47] <+notorious_cid> They typically use sour cream as a way to add the "doughiness" and fluffiness associated with donuts

[2022-12-20 20:37:38] <%+sw33tt3adream> @Unsung_Bee You're not dumb, not educated, sit and learn. You are going to do great.
[2022-12-20 20:37:40] <gstreet04> bull
[2022-12-20 20:37:42] <+Zav0c> In league of legends, it shows your LP gains towards your next rank so you see exactly how close you are and how much xp you gain/lose per game. That would be helpful in ranked for Overwatch
[2022-12-20 20:37:42] <+justjammin9799> You know what'd be lit... if they left options if you want the 7 and 20 or if you want a progress bar
[2022-12-20 20:37:46] <privateryan0001> what are the drops?
[2022-12-20 20:37:54] <!%+Sanoresin> @Vent_YeahManThatsCool He's m3m3 so he gets extra kills
[2022-12-20 20:37:57] <+clamay11> so the new ranking system is the same as OW1 but the number is gone
[2022-12-20 20:37:59] <OrderOfKhaos> 3 games would be good, just so you can see where you are at, or like an update to how it's going.
[2022-12-20 20:37:59] <%+Unsung_Bee> @sw33tt3adream emongSad emongSad too much smart video game talk.
[2022-12-20 20:38:02] <%+KShellZx> there needs to be some indication of where your rank is while you're in placing games
[2022-12-20 20:38:03] <%+quantcon> @cy4nar4 I think the point is that the hidden rank can be performance based, while the SR can be win/loss based. This means you are motivated to win and not just pad your stats.
[2022-12-20 20:38:08] <LordDikusMaximus> @Emongg it should just be 7 games if you win or lose it counts to those games
[2022-12-20 20:38:14] <+clamay11> so if they made it less than 7 wins you would probably not change much
[2022-12-20 20:38:28] <%+sw33tt3adream> @Unsung_Bee I have faith in you beautiful. Keep you're head up, I feel the same all the time. One day at a time.
[2022-12-20 20:38:30] <Igbyologist> It feels weird when my win rate in comp is less than 50% but my division rank keeps going up. I'm much more interested in knowing what my actual skill is then the vanity number.
[2022-12-20 20:38:32] <SuperGR> got placed gold 2 and play against masters n GM players while I have the mf people who just installed
[2022-12-20 20:38:33] <%RYANREIGN> maybe just show it every 7 games regardless of win or lose.
[2022-12-20 20:38:38] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> you did have a take on that

[2022-12-20 20:38:46] <+clamay11> I don't think the info will change fast enough if it is less than 7
[2022-12-20 20:38:46] <+lazorbheemz> it makes the victories feel like victories rather than one victory every 7 games

[2022-12-20 20:52:37] <speakr4theded> all that blog post did was prove that only new players have a chance to rank up in OW. The whole balance system is based off MMR and MMR only significantly changes after you first start

[2022-12-20 23:03:57] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
