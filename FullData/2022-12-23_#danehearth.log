[2022-12-23 01:33:41] <maxoupinou78> lifesteal works because it procs at the same time you deal damage, deathrattles don't because they proc after the action (so after the hero died and lost the game

[2022-12-23 03:48:02] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-23 03:48:29] <ShadowMageAlpha> Perhaps a mid point in the control of what you have to discard?
[2022-12-23 03:48:33] <maxoupinou78> I don't think so, discard is a garbage mechanic lul, we would need some fresh new cards
[2022-12-23 03:48:54] <ShadowMageAlpha> Like "Discord one of the two most expensive cards in your hand" or something like that?
[2022-12-23 03:49:02] <maxoupinou78> control and discard have opposing synergies
[2022-12-23 03:49:18] <Kevak321> targeted discard is always strong, that's why soulfire is a wild card
[2022-12-23 03:49:28] <blood13666> probably more discard cards popping in next expact(at least i believe so since they bringing back discard mechanic into standard).....those might make wild rly broke on release XD
[2022-12-23 03:49:44] <Rodrigos197> weakening the effect of the discard card itself while reworking discard to work like a discover could work.
[2022-12-23 03:49:52] <Rodrigos197> but just more cards seems better

[2022-12-23 03:53:08] <Kevak321> except if that card is soul barrage
[2022-12-23 03:53:36] <maxoupinou78> yup soul barrage is literally carrying this deck
[2022-12-23 03:53:40] <Rodrigos197> discard just seems highroll by design

[2022-12-23 03:58:45] <ShadowMageAlpha> The Shock Spitter deck wasn't really high-rolly as far as I could tell. But they also nerfed that hella fast
[2022-12-23 03:59:02] <+chazzmcbad> dat board swing
[2022-12-23 03:59:08] <ShadowMageAlpha> But it had a ton of ways to get the card it needed and a good number of ways to activate the effect
[2022-12-23 03:59:17] <Rodrigos197> shockspitter died for brann's sins tbh.
[2022-12-23 03:59:20] <reloadedtwopointohh> i afk'd for like an hour was devourer always in deck?
[2022-12-23 03:59:48] <Kevak321> brann will forever enable battlecry shenanigans
[2022-12-23 03:59:57] <Rodrigos197> brann is a perfectly fine card but standard shouldn't have it
[2022-12-23 03:59:57] <ShadowMageAlpha> Even within Brann, I imagine Shockspitter would be terrifying. Especially with how many times you can copy it.

[2022-12-23 04:01:27] <maxoupinou78> they could reprint some strong battlecry cards into manathurst instead, that would be a really good idea to balance the game imo ^^ if one wanted to balance shit that is
[2022-12-23 04:01:32] <Rodrigos197> shockspitter nerf was rough thou. since it's a card you want to play multiple times, so what looks just like 1 mana ends up as a like 4 mana change

[2022-12-23 04:30:53] <+mrtarvanis> People seem to forget that Ben Brode was in charge of Cards for blizzard long before Hs existed, all those old cards for World of Warcraft back in the day? that was Ben Brode, Spectral Tiger etc? Brode :p
