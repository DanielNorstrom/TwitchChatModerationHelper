[2023-01-08 16:19:53] <HerpleyDerpley> Or if "locker" is too many syllables, they could have just shortened it to "trunk."  Oh, wait!

[2023-01-08 20:21:07] <%UncleElias> Cringer in case you didn't know, in Options, Display tab, Cursor section, you can select Show Mouse Cursor While Aiming. It might help with fights. If you did know, did you also know you can go to the river to die Kappa
[2023-01-08 20:21:08] <%trivialmind> Vanilla PZ guns are a bad idea early on IMO. Your skill is low so you miss a lot, there's not a lot of ammo, and noise draws more Zs.
