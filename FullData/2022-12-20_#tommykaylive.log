[2022-12-20 15:33:28] <%Clutrike> inconsistency is the killer. you could have the best content ever, but if it becomes sporadic, you fall off as hard as tik tokers. the constant toxicity there for two months was horrible to sit through, literally unfollowed cause of it. Hope the bald man recovers, no one else that streams paradox games is interesting even in the slightest
