[2023-01-04 00:50:06] <Amostein> @Big_Headed_Gamer what exactly
[2023-01-04 00:50:19] <Big_Headed_Gamer> youtube editor
[2023-01-04 00:50:50] <Amostein> I think that was just needed so he could keep up with the others
[2023-01-04 00:51:18] <Amostein> Because I personally watching a lot of youtube and feels way better if the video is well edited
[2023-01-04 00:51:22] <Big_Headed_Gamer> gotcha
[2023-01-04 00:51:31] VIEWERS: 1 620
[2023-01-04 00:51:58] <Big_Headed_Gamer> makes sense
[2023-01-04 00:52:26] <Amostein> Like I love watching Jacksepticeye and his editor makes such a good job
[2023-01-04 00:52:54] <Amostein> One time he had no game audio for the 30 mins gameplay, he didn't want to scrap it so he just put sound effects for the whole video
[2023-01-04 00:53:05] <Amostein> The game was "Goat simulator 3" fun game
[2023-01-04 00:53:07] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Amostein robin, and the goat simulator vid?
[2023-01-04 00:53:08] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> lmao
[2023-01-04 00:53:17] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> if he hadnt mentioned it
[2023-01-04 00:53:22] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i probably wouldnt have noticed

[2023-01-04 00:54:16] <Amostein> @TubbyTheSatan it's way better than the first one, that's what I was mostly excited for
[2023-01-04 00:54:29] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> speaking of which... why tf not goat simulator 2... lol
[2023-01-04 00:54:33] <Amostein> Bc he just put all X streamer here, then next streamer, didn't really shuffle them
[2023-01-04 00:54:43] <Amostein> Bc goat sim 3 released
