[2022-12-08 03:13:44] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-08 03:42:30] <lemlbb> pharah mercy annoying nowadays bruh
[2022-12-08 03:42:38] <%+kazenblade29> Is Pharah the most damage output in the game still?
[2022-12-08 03:42:42] <Rav0nna> can someone link the most recent hero balance changes for me?
[2022-12-08 03:42:42] <+tricky_vixen> Is the drop not showing up in anyone else’s inventory?
[2022-12-08 03:42:44] <+Deozaki> @Delfin0_ I'm iffy cause I know I'm not playing him well, but I don't think any changes is gonna make him a good "tank". Cause his kit just feels like a dps kit still

[2022-12-08 03:43:24] <atulvius> Ramattra's kit is definitely questionable. The whole tempo style is definitely a curveball to some of the other heroes mechanics.

[2022-12-08 04:24:18] <+N8_WLD> they said there would be 2 supports out of the next 3 heroes so the next hero will be a support
[2022-12-08 04:24:19] <+knichs> any cool ideas for improving support role?

[2022-12-08 04:24:44] <%+abysse_0> Is it normal that the last shot of storm arrow and when you spammed the arrows on Hanzo the bow going crazy ?
[2022-12-08 04:24:45] <DeathsChokeHold> Guys! Did you hear they nerfed Sojourn and Bufed Junkerqueen?
[2022-12-08 04:24:46] <DeciusCorvinus> anyone else feel there is a conspiracy that blizz made ramatra weaker on purpose so ppl couldn't say hes "pay to win"
[2022-12-08 04:24:51] <heccofheccs> ngl i don't care about climbing, but I feel like qp is less about "chill a lil bit" to "mini comp" with all the shit talk in chat lol

[2022-12-08 18:09:20] <%xoCakepop> pahaha

[2022-12-08 18:09:38] <$Dr_Gomu> Honestly I have fallen in love with ramattra even if he is just okay. Think I found my new main
[2022-12-08 18:09:39] <%KevinKalani> They would also sell the most merch... 100%
[2022-12-08 18:09:43] <+NaiiroGM> wasnt there a league team like that a few years ago

[2022-12-08 18:09:49] <%OwOkiku> i would support it
[2022-12-08 18:09:49] <+maktrophies> and people will actually watch instead of just afk for tokens
[2022-12-08 18:09:52] <HellCastleBTW> that's how it should be tbh

[2022-12-08 18:09:56] <sanya567xxx> They'd get shit on by community like Kephrii @Flats
[2022-12-08 18:10:00] <shaso_snapple> Dota 2 had this with team Arkosh and it didnt work out, granted they are an NA team and the population there is mostly EU
[2022-12-08 18:10:00] <infrared_light_ray_vision> Flats do you think they should add motion controls to Overwatch PC? They have it on switch so I think they should add it to PC for controller players

[2022-12-08 18:11:18] <weetodeman> ngl would be interested in seeing Flat make a team
[2022-12-08 18:11:19] <%BlackLightningK> as a jacksonville native... that hurt LMFAO
[2022-12-08 18:11:22] <condorbebe> Jaguars have spent more on players than any other team in the last 5 years. It’s true lmao

[2022-12-08 18:11:40] <+ididnotgoogle> also the difference is that E sports player are closer in skill level than actual sports
[2022-12-08 18:11:40] <Uwawi> Flats if you ever made a team, what would the name be?
[2022-12-08 18:11:47] <pilznic> do it
[2022-12-08 18:11:48] <+Infinites> OWL literally went from filling stadiums and being hyped up non-stop to being dead in the water in like one season
[2022-12-08 18:11:49] <+ididnotgoogle> e sports shouldnt be compared to actual sports
[2022-12-08 18:11:50] <collector288> i had to face off against a kiriko hog comp this week and omg is it so anoying to play against lol

[2022-12-08 18:12:16] <sanya567xxx> Its a disrespect of the league and competitors and it'd attract hate from the fans. See Kephrii's contenders example
[2022-12-08 18:12:20] <lekingoftacos> you think Ramattra needs any buffs flats?
[2022-12-08 18:12:29] <%jackstoningt0n> The bulls just did. Spent all s bunch of money of free agents and are in the lottery right now
[2022-12-08 18:12:39] <fractalelf2035> Chess is a sport
[2022-12-08 18:12:44] <+Infinites> OWL wanted to be the NFL of e-sports
[2022-12-08 18:12:48] <%h3lios227> do teams have salary caps?
[2022-12-08 18:12:57] <+nickuhfoster> Cass dipped out so quick after that ult
[2022-12-08 18:12:57] <+EJ_yesthatEJ> it's a rare talent. you get paid to compete?
[2022-12-08 18:13:04] <collector288> a question for everyone  what made you keep playing overwatch?
[2022-12-08 18:13:08] <cloudywav> rams ult is so scary
[2022-12-08 18:13:10] <+snorlaxius> Why can you quick melee in nemesis form? It looks so silly
[2022-12-08 18:13:13] <fractalelf2035> Not sure why people think physical sports don't include eSports which are neurologically based

[2022-12-08 18:13:19] <%willowwispuwu> I saw ur tiktok saying that supports are gunna play dbd now with the doomfist changes and its very accurate btw i am having an interesting time

[2022-12-08 18:13:21] <POOTYjohn> Atlanta had decent vibes pre-pandemic. Were selling out the nice venue they were hosting games at. It was actually a cool feeling.
[2022-12-08 18:13:24] <%+Mrgrimm3> streamers prob wouldnt do it
[2022-12-08 18:13:29] <%KevinKalani> Flats you ever see "The Replacements" with Keanu Reeves? Feels like that
[2022-12-08 18:13:30] <%+FLAsLT> @collector288 The other option was for honor so flatsShrug

[2022-12-08 18:13:41] <collector288> @manos_drag  interesting
[2022-12-08 18:13:41] <%+i3uzzy> @collector288 only the fact that ow league mercy skin might come back at any point lol
[2022-12-08 18:13:41] <lekingoftacos> @collector288 new heros and my friends still play it
[2022-12-08 18:13:46] <alex_dee_223> I saw your video on Ramattra .does ramattra need a buff and what would be the best way to go about it?
[2022-12-08 18:13:46] <theunboundednight> bronze overwatch league would be amazing to watch
[2022-12-08 18:13:48] <OP_HEX> My only problem with ramattra is that his pov is in his chest and when I noticed that it felt like he was slightly in the ground
[2022-12-08 18:13:49] <EmmyBear_Arts> this is great to listen to during class
[2022-12-08 18:13:57] <%TheClimbingSloth> What would you do differently then if you were in charge of OWL?
[2022-12-08 18:13:57] <ac_is_clk> You would have to get mid tier streamers as that would actually grow their brand. Larger streamers would probably lose viewers because of the constant Ls imo
[2022-12-08 18:14:00] <+VikingsPlay> OWL needs to have a team $$ cap and then cut it in half and have players that live in each city try out. so 1//2 the "season" tryouts and build a team then big playoffs.  like collage football its better to watch because its not all 100% meta.
[2022-12-08 18:14:03] <lekingoftacos> it has its moments where it can be fun, that's jus how ow be
[2022-12-08 18:14:04] <kurruptix> Hey flats only started playing overwatch recently and your content has been so entertaining to watch.
[2022-12-08 18:14:04] <sanya567xxx> @collector288 game design. It's VERY thought out to a huge level. And unique gameplay.
[2022-12-08 18:14:07] <cloudywav> @theunboundednight finally a league of my own

[2022-12-08 18:14:21] <%willowwispuwu> The double ramattra is terrifying
[2022-12-08 18:14:32] <brianthedraftpony007> Overwatch league is like the baseball or NBA of OWL. It runs at a series of best of 5 has home and away and has a best of 7 during the finals.
[2022-12-08 18:14:33] <%jackstoningt0n> Does a streamer still get the same payout from streaming a tournament? Or does the team they’re signed to also get a cut?

[2022-12-08 18:17:27] <%+MOSSUP> hi @digitalhadoken1 :D
[2022-12-08 18:17:28] <TVCHacks> @jackstoningt0n thats a pretty good one

[2022-12-08 18:17:30] <%+FLAsLT> @digitalhadoken1 hi there cowboy
[2022-12-08 18:17:30] <%KevinKalani> @Infinites It's not the meta, it's the timing. What happens is the first stage meta was when the players had the game for months to figure stuff out, when they got new patches for new stages they have to find the thing that gets the most value for the least amount of effort in a short amount of time. Most teams just see what a team does in scrims if it looks good and copies it
[2022-12-08 18:17:30] <+Infinites> @TheGrimBandit you know that's actually a good comparison

[2022-12-08 18:18:46] <%Ditis_Patris> I really think this game would benefit from making dps and support characters have each others abilities. example,You could play sym as a support or you could play ana as a dps. It would require alot of work but make the game very exciting
[2022-12-08 18:18:50] <+Chairing> i feel it

[2022-12-08 18:19:31] <everfae> @igoodvibe same
[2022-12-08 18:19:31] <sanya567xxx> @KevinKalani meta still influences and it's not as great to sit through. Goats for example was played because it turned out to be the optimal way in most cases. I liked going through POVs and learning with our own team together but still kind of meh for most of the higher levels
[2022-12-08 18:19:32] <+pixeledprince> Why is ranked so bad?

[2022-12-08 18:21:00] <%KevinKalani> @sanya567xxx that's what I mean though, Goats developed because of the amount of time it took for them to patch it out. Time has always been the issue. What I meant for this last OWL season, is that the reason the meta was the way it was 5v5 of the same exact comp picks was the lack of time to develop different strats

The holy one, Aaron Keller blesses him by allowing him to play tank this time. They load into Kings Row and Flats picks Doomfist. The cries of Emongg and Seagull slowly fade as the countdown reaches five. The spawn doors open. Flats tightens his grip on his mouse and whispers “It’s Doomin time”.]

[2022-12-08 18:43:38] <@%$R3trohowling> Something about putting gameplay over a speaking topic
[2022-12-08 18:43:43] <spautot> I like how I always aim a bit off with guns but ramattra's slow projectile makes it so it compensates for aim being off so I got better aim with him, weridly enough
[2022-12-08 18:43:44] <%lzimmlive> Almost done with the paper I'm working on.
[2022-12-08 18:43:45] <Yavvo> I wish you could fine tune hero damage, cooldowns, etc. more in custom modes, on an individual hero level. Put all of those ideas into practice and see how something like 250 pin Rein actually feels
[2022-12-08 18:43:45] <bofaoyl> this game needs more one shot abilities and characters that can teleport.

[2022-12-08 18:44:12] <EmmyBear_Arts> how I'm seeing it as an artist, doing stuff that does well according to data always leave you feeling bad and Unhappy. but when you do things that make you and people happy you do better mentally and in general cuz it's more organic and unique and not just some copy pasted image.
[2022-12-08 18:44:15] <%willowwispuwu> I really like this new map- what about you?

[2022-12-08 18:45:00] <+chrisscrispycoop> so blizzard choices their buffs and Nerfs based on win rates in games?
[2022-12-08 18:45:01] <Nexallus> Can you make a youtube video of what you explained about ranked not being fun? I feel like people need to know this
[2022-12-08 18:45:02] <Ragdoll727> support will feel better next season when we get the new support legend
[2022-12-08 18:45:03] <bryandesagres> Bro Ramattra fun, but so easy to counter in GM at the moment
[2022-12-08 18:45:03] <Sireniii> you were 100% correct flats. It is awful atm

[2022-12-08 18:45:21] <%cheeseandbrews> @flats it was easily least fun q last season for me too. everyone so toxic to support its unfun

[2022-12-08 18:46:03] <Saturyssa> ngl i think ramattras ult is pretty good. It makes so much space
[2022-12-08 18:46:04] <%n3rdygn0m3> agreed
[2022-12-08 18:46:05] <czarboldy> feel like if you block enough damage you should do a short dash forward on release

[2022-12-08 18:46:39] <Zee_Guy> can there be a support that is effective without healing? providing shields or armor, without also being broken
[2022-12-08 18:46:42] <+Blaster50___> Ranked isn’t fun for casuals either, the fun characters suck
[2022-12-08 18:46:42] <%cheeseandbrews> @cloudywav yesterday they placed supports when I had 16k hlz and double digit kills. smh
[2022-12-08 18:46:46] <MonsieurPenguin_> they're definitely focused on the casuals, it'll be interesting to see how it flushes out in the end

[2022-12-08 18:47:06] <%willowwispuwu> I love playing open queue with 3 tanks and me solo healing as mercy flatsCry

[2022-12-08 18:47:26] <spautot> @rando_mario They really said "Battle mercy goes brrrr" with this one
[2022-12-08 18:47:27] <%rabidraider19> that would be cool a support that gives shields or armor instead of healing

[2022-12-08 18:47:39] <%cheeseandbrews> ow2 support is like being a doctor with a delusional patient.
[2022-12-08 18:47:41] <+Chairing> i think getting more xp in comp just tells ppl to play that to level up your battlepass faster

[2022-12-08 18:49:09] <FastPhil19> @IronAddictKidd I get that but I'm just curious of the actual gameplay. like maybe the heal is much stornger than the hit box increase, or maybe its the opposite when you actually play them, just curious :)
[2022-12-08 18:49:10] <kennerdo> @sireniii Cause they had and extra tank to shoot at / protect them.

[2022-12-08 18:52:00] <+SmaCK10101> issue is ppl don't understand that the games balance revolves around counters, not everyone being balanced against each other
[2022-12-08 18:52:01] <%ludusknight> @sanya567xxx i guess, but can you do it every time?
[2022-12-08 18:52:02] <ver1ser> junk and doom are like the only fun charracters in the meta imo
[2022-12-08 18:52:05] <FastPhil19> surprisingly didnt see a lot of tracer, but doom/hog almost every game
[2022-12-08 18:52:10] <MonsieurPenguin_> how's bastion doing
[2022-12-08 18:52:10] <Meson17> so many master players got kicked down into gold. Games are horrible right now
[2022-12-08 18:52:10] <+b1g_kitty> instead I got some dumb bow recoil >_>

[2022-12-08 18:52:13] <baazos> I hate this meta
[2022-12-08 18:52:14] <DennoNNN> I still think it's hilarious that people were hopeful for Overwatch 2 when OW 1 was absolutely disastrous
[2022-12-08 18:52:16] <thedandy_boy> @ig_clown 120 130 I think one time used to do 150

[2022-12-08 18:52:28] <spautot> aight I'm going back to star wars battlefront 2 where I can do crowd management with mines, grenade launcher and poison gas against 5 people
[2022-12-08 18:52:31] <kennerdo> Would bans help?
[2022-12-08 18:52:31] <EmmyBear_Arts> I heard that they might revert the nerfs on a few characters including Genji after the passive removal and I hope this is true and not just some hopeful fake stuff

[2022-12-08 18:52:32] <wagwubeef> soldier ?
[2022-12-08 18:52:34] <%+TheEmpireRoyale> a lot of games change there mechanics/playstyle/etc to cater to the casual to appeal to the masses.
[2022-12-08 18:52:35] <Cosmicxbug> That’s not a meta change that’s a substitution

[2022-12-08 18:52:39] <digitalhadoken1> who remembers snoats
[2022-12-08 18:52:39] <Zadriar> would you say being a lower rank is more enjoyable in OW2?
[2022-12-08 18:52:40] <%ItsCraigAgainZA> your boom is proof hard work pays off kudos man
[2022-12-08 18:52:41] <notgoot> but you are alowed to do whatever in qp
[2022-12-08 18:52:42] <%+mommadragonn> it fuckin is ! QP be hella sweaty LOL
[2022-12-08 18:52:43] <+itsclearlydavid> Will Zenyatta be better considering meta tanks are non sheilders?
[2022-12-08 18:52:43] <mangerino2008> ball buff would be amazing

[2022-12-08 18:52:45] <+TheVenturist> never played comp in ow1 and was waiting for ow2 but now maybe I won't lol
[2022-12-08 18:52:45] <%+Pirogoeth_> Is it a hot take to think that Doom is really fun right now?
[2022-12-08 18:52:47] <Sireniii> QP feels better than comp honestly
[2022-12-08 18:52:47] <%+wpaimon> The ranked rewards are a joke
[2022-12-08 18:52:48] <%+rando_mario> Open Queue comp is where it's going to be at. just lean into the jank
[2022-12-08 18:52:50] <thebaitman317> @kennerdo good question
[2022-12-08 18:52:50] <weetodeman> imagine u can ban some heros on both side
[2022-12-08 18:52:50] <FastPhil19> qp still has mmr so yeah basically comp
[2022-12-08 18:52:51] <%TheClimbingSloth> Flats do you think the balance patches will be better once Blizz is officially under Microsoft
[2022-12-08 18:52:51] <mojo0040> yea back in OW1 i never played comp, i have like all my hours on quick play lmao
[2022-12-08 18:52:51] <+the_lucky_gremlin> Wish drops worked
[2022-12-08 18:52:52] <tinysnorlax1> if you could choose what the meta was wich 5 heroes would be the top pick?
[2022-12-08 18:52:53] <thedandy_boy> @ig_clown what?
[2022-12-08 18:52:54] <CnayR_> But qp you can actually play with your friends
[2022-12-08 18:52:57] <+b1g_kitty> I am a gold/silver and had a top 500 in my qp with two diamonds
[2022-12-08 18:53:00] <Gu1nea> atleast hog isn't practically invincible every 10 seconds
[2022-12-08 18:53:01] <+SmaCK10101> if everyone could kill everyone easily it wouldn't be fun
[2022-12-08 18:53:03] <slavicboii> i only play comp to get a golden gun
[2022-12-08 18:53:04] <bygraceonly> I get WAY better qp games  than i do in my ranked plat games

[2022-12-08 18:54:08] <+magic__brian> At my level I'm finding more active throwers in QP. At least in comp they have something to lose.
[2022-12-08 18:54:09] <whitewolf991> arcade is fun too, sometimes

[2022-12-08 18:54:37] <HypeTime99> People honestly in my pub games try harder than in my comp games. my friend and I qued for a qp on accedent and we thought it was a comp because of how hard it was.
[2022-12-08 18:54:37] <Zee_Guy> they are both too hesitant and too eager with changes to heroes. Like they don't want to mess with Sojourn but gladly buff the hell out of Doom. The long wait for patches I would have expected them to have just been waiting for the changes from OW1 to OW2 to settle and see how meta stood.

[2022-12-08 18:55:50] <+SmaCK10101> u are telling me u don't withhold your shit?

[2022-12-08 18:56:00] <thedandy_boy> @ig_clown yep if you focus on your traps or if people actually look at the trapped person yeah
[2022-12-08 18:56:01] <%xTheGameFreakx> You also have a poop bucket right flats?
[2022-12-08 18:56:01] <+SmaCK10101> I'd be worried if they sent a poop fork too
[2022-12-08 18:56:01] <spautot> What else does he keep there I'm scared
[2022-12-08 18:56:01] <s11ushie> rammatra sounds like a cod zombie
[2022-12-08 18:56:04] <%$TeaHauss> but plungers are bludgeoning weapons, sometimes you need a slashing weapon for the poop variants
[2022-12-08 18:56:04] <+Morphooo> Right now all the ranks are weird due to everyone going down basically a whole division but your hidden MMR is still the same so its kinda irrelevant. That is at least how it feels.

[2022-12-08 18:56:10] <mojo0040> LMAO bro was hiding

[2022-12-08 18:56:18] <bofaoyl> you keep the poop knife next to the plunger in case it needs some chopin up before flushing
[2022-12-08 18:56:18] <eggybeastmode> AWW
[2022-12-08 18:56:20] <wagwubeef> flats what tier you think soldier is
[2022-12-08 18:56:24] <kennerdo> @almightyheadass For when the poop is too big to flush; gotta chop it up.
[2022-12-08 18:56:25] <+brucealmighty0> can you butter the toast with poop knife? asking for a friend
[2022-12-08 18:56:28] <+Mrpebble1236> Poop drawer is the drawer you keep the poops you take during 24 hour gaming sessions obviously

[2022-12-08 18:57:42] <Rasgore> @Flats do you think a locked hero select would be a good idea for comp?
[2022-12-08 18:57:43] <Kalaaleq> @Flats Imagine Ramattra's ult had life steal.
[2022-12-08 18:57:44] <digitalhadoken1> please 🥺
[2022-12-08 18:57:45] <spautot> the reaper was sitting in from of the ram like HUH

[2022-12-08 18:58:02] <+Morphooo> I would say Tracer is much harder to play than Sojourn
[2022-12-08 18:58:02] <+Elsha1> same thing but sometimes twice as short
[2022-12-08 18:58:05] <re_life_> how much credit to unlock kiriko?
[2022-12-08 18:58:06] <+grazzingcow> i like playing both sides in comp, wish quickplay let you play both sides
[2022-12-08 18:58:06] <AmurPanthera> henlo (: watched lots of your youtubes recently, Flats! thought I'd check stream ^^ how are you, chat?
[2022-12-08 18:58:09] <+Morphooo> especially now you get ult and can just spam body shot people
[2022-12-08 18:58:10] <1classynative> why play comp when quickplay is the same? Why invest in pro teams when quickplay is the same thing?
[2022-12-08 18:58:11] <FastPhil19> ranks are almost useless anyway so its basically the same

[2022-12-08 19:06:42] <%TheGrandao> Yeah, @Flats i get you, its just life, we all have priorities but it doesnt mean theyre not your friends anymore. True friends are the ones you can go some time without talking and when you get the chance it feels the same as before.
[2022-12-08 19:06:43] <TheFazz101> going fishing
[2022-12-08 19:06:46] <+forcedmnky> As a single adult with all of my friends being married and having children it can definitely get lonely
[2022-12-08 19:06:46] <TrillZuna4L> Nothing wrong with being alone but ofc u need to go out every now and then

[2022-12-08 19:07:11] <+Link_NWK> I miss sports from school, that’s it
[2022-12-08 19:07:12] <ObludaKS> You can always reach out to those old friends, Im sure they'll appreciate it. But I get what you mean 100%, but thats why you find new friends who are in a similar enough stage of life that you can actually hang out.

I didn't start playing until I was in my senior year, but in a group of big guys like me, I felt a sense of community. Some of them used to bully me when I was younger, but by the end of the season, we were brothers.

[2022-12-08 19:10:33] <cloudywav> @ObludaKS if you'd like, you could start off with community college as its a cheaper option and you an achieve an associates
[2022-12-08 19:10:33] <EmmyBear_Arts> I'm kinda confused about something, when joining the community like a month ago I heard this stereotype that Genji players where mean/petty, but every genji I've played against or with has been so sweet and nice?

[2022-12-08 20:03:20] <+LegionRapier61> He probably genuinely respected you; being in a position of power like teaching you generally do not get direct and honest feedback from students and any feedback you get from parents or administrators is normally hyperbolic or disconnected.  So to have someone who is so much younger than you in a traditionally subordinate roll be willing to stand out and speak an honest opinion that is in direct opposition to what you have been led to believe can be refreshing.

[2022-12-08 20:09:15] <+KyleTheDecentLawyer> I feel like the Dev team was very cautious on Ram. The last 3 heroes released were well overtuned. I think Ram is closer to Echo level than Sojourn.

[2022-12-08 20:13:08] <+NotSurprised__> as someone who has played siege recently, y'all aren't missing much
[2022-12-08 20:13:09] <ver1ser> justice'd on
[2022-12-08 20:13:11] <cloudywav> I know supports should damage as well instead of just heal botting but one time our teams tank was blaming us supports bc we didnt have as much damage as the dps </3
[2022-12-08 20:13:13] <Nexallus> Will you ever play siege again?

[2022-12-08 20:13:40] <+MartianMagic> @lukatee Hitscan for DPS. Zen or bap for supp. Dva is best tank, Zarya is okay. Hope that helps!
[2022-12-08 20:13:42] <+NotSurprised__> like, straight up, siege is feeling more like a hero shooter than like, tactical shit

[2022-12-08 20:14:01] <ver1ser> fuck lion.
[2022-12-08 20:14:03] <jtishbk> To be honest. I believe seige players jumped ship to play this game. Being dead serious.

[2022-12-08 20:15:02] <cloudywav> I was so bad at siege
[2022-12-08 20:15:03] <%Jelly_Lizzu> Siege ended for me when someone tried to stalk me after they found out I was female.
[2022-12-08 20:15:05] <jimmydiggs123> Bro jackal hasn’t been in ranked in like 2 years 😂
[2022-12-08 20:15:06] <evilzenstars> It always sucks when unplayable version is better then a dominating version

[2022-12-08 20:15:17] <Zadriar> Lion and Finka were easily the biggest turning point for siege going into a crap game

[2022-12-08 20:15:25] <cloudywav> siege is ruined for me bc i played it with my ex (also that same ex took me to see joker in theatres on our first date LMAO)
[2022-12-08 20:15:29] <yamumshandler> jackal banned every game
[2022-12-08 20:15:30] <thedandy_boy> Did doom just go from the worst tank in the game to the 2nd best tank in the game?
[2022-12-08 20:15:30] <+nurodev> One thing I liked from siege was map / operator bans
[2022-12-08 20:15:33] <%bluedahlias> @Jelly_Lizzu creeps gotta ruin everything ;;

[2022-12-08 20:15:42] <overwatchstallion2612> @sheriothecheerio hes not a dps anymore tho. he doesnt need as much mobility as before because his job isnt to flank anymore, its to create space by staying at the front of the fight, not behind them. levae the flanking to the dps
[2022-12-08 20:15:44] <genji_boi420> Jackal is horrible still
[2022-12-08 20:15:44] <GamingNight429> I still rarely see jackal in ranked siege now, he's always being banned
[2022-12-08 20:15:49] <tyrannosauruszeph> Do you think orissa can counter doom? Lower rank.
[2022-12-08 20:15:53] <YungMucha> jackal been gettin banned for 3 years
[2022-12-08 20:15:54] <Zadriar> then they added like alibi who just made holograms and shit and the game just felt so weird
[2022-12-08 20:15:56] <itsjustegg> Lion would give his team wall hacks and decimate the enemies

[2022-12-08 20:40:55] <MehdiCraneDeKiwi> ramattra isnt so good right ?

[2022-12-08 20:44:51] <%FauxHiro> my bad take is that the removal of the second tank is the only reason i got back into OW. i left because i couldnt stand the 10 minute long team fights

[2022-12-08 20:44:59] <+OmegaRh0> @Countryman117 that I know. but i guess certain surfaces also make it bounce. Like stairs on some maps it will bounce or roll down. not sure if that is intentional or not. but it has made for interesting placements sometimes lol
[2022-12-08 20:44:59] <tgs121394> your streams really came last for me. I started with tiktok then jumped to YouTube now I'm here lol

[2022-12-08 21:27:28] <vinny8675309> might not be a bug. seems like a stealth buff tbh. rewarding you for getting a stick by not randomly sometimes having the stuck person run into you
[2022-12-08 21:27:30] <%+Lovelygong> It's kind of funny to me that we waited 2 months for a Sojurn nerf and it didn't do anything.

[2022-12-08 21:37:29] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-08 23:37:18] <%+GoldClassGaming> @ShaLiin_ Soft resets are pretty common in other games like Apex and Valorant. As for WHY they do it: generally it's to make sure that people who don't play don't stay at a high rank they can't compete in anymore and so that players can contiunue to earn the satisfaction of ranking up even if they have stagnated as a player.
