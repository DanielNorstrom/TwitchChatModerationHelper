[2023-01-02 01:00:52] <Akaryn87> Naga priest seems to be in a good spot if it can beat warrior Kappa

[2023-01-02 01:05:55] <thegame___na> just because someone feels depressed doesnt mean its depression. its been found that depression and being at the bottom of a perceived dominance hierarchy have many of the same symptoms. often ppl confuse it
[2023-01-02 01:06:27] <+biesanu> @thegame___na whats a  perceived dominance hierarchy
[2023-01-02 01:06:48] <rekinom> perceive deez nuts dominating your hierarchy gottem
[2023-01-02 01:06:50] <grimBleeper> @thegame___na it's when you play rogue but complain that your decks keep getting nerfed

[2023-01-02 01:07:01] <thegame___na> @biesanu say you have a group of friends, and of the 3 of you, you make the least. that could be a perceived dominance hierarchy
[2023-01-02 01:07:11] <+chandleriab> Honestly when i switched up my medication it did wonders
[2023-01-02 01:07:14] <%+Darkthunder119> maybe its the meta
[2023-01-02 01:07:16] <thegame___na> its not nonsense, itd literally in psychological papers
[2023-01-02 01:07:19] <%+Darkthunder119> we all hate the meta lol
[2023-01-02 01:07:19] <thegame___na> its*

[2023-01-02 01:07:58] <grimBleeper> studies have shown that norwis is 3 times as happy as everyone else
[2023-01-02 01:08:05] <thegame___na> thats why the word "perceived" is in there. if its not important to you, then it wont affect you
[2023-01-02 01:08:26] <%culleexus> playing enough to be rank 1 with priest on all 3 servers doesnt sound like happiness tbh Kappa
[2023-01-02 01:09:04] <+ph788> Im getting problems with Quest FEL DH against paladin, i'm playing wrong?

[2023-01-02 01:09:56] <TicTacTime> he's clearly talking about the hierarchy in life LUL
[2023-01-02 01:10:27] <grimBleeper> @ph788 vs says that quest dh is unfavoured in that matchup so you might not be playing wrong and that's just how it goes but there might also be some things you could be doing better
[2023-01-02 01:10:33] <%+Xeath5> i am so happy they always do emergency buffs to rogue when it hits tier 2 for all the crybabys who only like rogue when its by far the best deck nohandsKappa
[2023-01-02 01:10:46] <+Mungo4u> going leggo on hunter should be fun
[2023-01-02 01:10:57] <%+Xeath5> like how insanley op does rogue have to be for people to shut up
[2023-01-02 01:11:04] <%+Xeath5> i remember when rogue was tier 2 and EVERYONE was complaining
[2023-01-02 01:11:10] <%+Xeath5> meanwhile i was top 20 with SPOOKY MAGE
[2023-01-02 01:11:13] <%+Antonbrehbrahbruh> buffed enrage would be scary

[2023-01-02 01:12:21] <thegame___na> reduce warrior cards by 1 mana and its still probably unplayable
[2023-01-02 01:12:22] <%+Darkthunder119> they can just remove the last warrior set
[2023-01-02 01:12:28] <%+Darkthunder119> and game wont change LOL
[2023-01-02 01:12:30] <%notrealge0> Who cares about enrage warrior. Bring back pirate warrior

[2023-01-02 01:20:15] <%+Xeath5> i mean fine give rogue 11 cards to play on turn 2
[2023-01-02 01:20:19] <grimBleeper> YEP i am now playing coc rogue because why would i cheat 2 mana at a time as beast hunter when i can cheat 2 mana per card as coc rogue
[2023-01-02 01:20:24] <+chandleriab> Current state of warrior reminds me of when they nerfed priest to shit and it was unplayable for a while
[2023-01-02 01:20:24] <%+Xeath5> but dont print 5 useless legendaries for shaman in a row
[2023-01-02 01:20:27] <%notrealge0> Just remember that blizzard loves rogues. rogues are S tier in WoW and in HS

[2023-01-02 01:22:24] <%+Xeath5> LIKE WTF
[2023-01-02 01:22:41] <Akaryn87> If they print new cards, the warrior design leader always has to start first. He presents the cards and the next day an other class is presenting, changing the cards over night. Druid and rogue are always last 2 spots. That‚Äôs simply the way it is Kappa
[2023-01-02 01:22:46] <%+Xeath5> i mean

[2023-01-02 01:23:56] <IcyMcSp1cy> IDK what rogue cards should even be nerfed, the whole class is just ridiculous
[2023-01-02 01:24:38] <InvisionHS> Efficient is sufficient

[2023-01-02 01:25:02] <%+Xeath5> but bring some other classes to a level where you dont lose 80% of your games vs rogue

[2023-01-02 01:26:20] <%+Xeath5> no idea
[2023-01-02 01:26:26] <hstraxamillion> even with concoctions boon priest is still heavily favored vs miracle rogue
[2023-01-02 01:26:29] <%+Xeath5> they will probably nerf gnoll a bit and call it a day
[2023-01-02 01:26:34] <%+Xeath5> and pretend its not far ahead still
[2023-01-02 01:26:35] <%+Xeath5> or something
[2023-01-02 01:26:42] <hstraxamillion> I would think naga priest is likely just as good if not better
[2023-01-02 01:26:45] <%+Citybuilder45> Why was gnoll even reverted?
[2023-01-02 01:26:47] <%+Citybuilder45> Madge
[2023-01-02 01:26:56] <hstraxamillion> naga priest almost certainly still t1
[2023-01-02 01:26:56] <grimBleeper> EZ in the court of standard, they're a rogue until proven otherwise

[2023-01-02 01:27:58] <%+Xeath5> like why are there no emergency buffs for warrior or shaman
[2023-01-02 01:28:00] <IcyMcSp1cy> I don't think gnoll/maestra makes for interesting gameplay
[2023-01-02 01:28:18] <%+Xeath5> the way you win vs rogue is hope they dont have good draw
[2023-01-02 01:28:33] <%+PidiaP> The way Maestra and Gnoll interact is the dumbest shit
[2023-01-02 01:28:40] <hstraxamillion> you spread a wide board and boon they usually can't clear, boon is still winning vs roguue
[2023-01-02 01:28:41] <JewFye> rotation will save us COPIUM
[2023-01-02 01:28:43] <+chandleriab> take away the stealth for the ghosts

[2023-01-02 01:30:30] <Yaya_> Reddit is always the loudest when Priest, Shaman, and Warrior are good and Blizzard values Reddit's opinion for some reason
[2023-01-02 01:30:31] <IcyMcSp1cy> They also hate death knight KEKW
[2023-01-02 01:30:33] <%+Xeath5> i love dk too
[2023-01-02 01:30:38] <%culleexus> they hate priest enough to make it t1 sometimes. thats so evil Sadge
[2023-01-02 01:30:38] <+CrispR4t> he started the turn with 4 cards in hand. ended with 6 and a really good board
[2023-01-02 01:30:43] <%+Xeath5> well most played ever is mage
[2023-01-02 01:30:44] <+FallOutShaun> hates warrior? is porate warrior still in rotation?
[2023-01-02 01:30:49] <+FallOutShaun> pirate

[2023-01-02 01:31:28] <caybellHS> a love thing is cards like Guff (hero) and topior
[2023-01-02 01:31:37] <grimBleeper> pirate warrior got booted out by enrage warrior in the aggro archetype earlier this year

[2023-01-02 01:32:29] <Yaya_> The shadows don't need to have stealth, if you wanna pop off and make a 9/9 along with a bunch of other stuff that's fine but like, people should be able to respond to it

[2023-01-02 01:34:17] <%+Xeath5> they are going to nerf old cards
[2023-01-02 01:34:22] <%+Xeath5> and we all gonna be fked again after rotation
[2023-01-02 01:34:30] <%+The_monster_hunter> They don't understand it, thats why they make changes like nerfing Anub'rehkan instead of rotating brann early
[2023-01-02 01:35:00] <%+Xeath5> anub wasnt changed so it would not work they said they want to have the otk in the deck @The_monster_hunter

[2023-01-02 01:36:54] <NooroonGee> I wish Mage had Janalai with wild fire in standard. That would feel good probably not even OP
[2023-01-02 01:36:54] <hstraxamillion> garrote isn't actually 20 percent just because of bads playing it reflecting in the stats. watch maxie play it and consistently run through his deck by 6
[2023-01-02 01:37:12] <%+The_monster_hunter> @Xeath5 when did they say that? Besides my logic for why thats a problem is that they nerf new cards instead of the old cards that have been problematic for 7 years
[2023-01-02 01:37:28] <+FallOutShaun> @grimBleeper it makes no sense because you cant accumulate corpses to empower the cards

[2023-01-02 01:40:21] <IcyMcSp1cy> Compare the rogue cards this expansion to the shaman ones. Not even close in terms of power level
[2023-01-02 01:40:22] <Akaryn87> They should just remove all classes except 1 and let players draw the same cards always in the same order. Just a modern chess Kappa

[2023-01-02 01:40:36] <%+Xeath5> @The_monster_hunter We wanted to reduce lethality and remove the ability for the combo to let players dump their entire hand, while still allowing ramp strategies.
[2023-01-02 01:40:37] <%vayazu2> there's a bg patch planned after the holidays, chance for emergency nerfs. but i don't think 1 or 2 cards is enough to change much

[2023-01-02 01:40:51] <%+The_monster_hunter> @Xeath5 they said they want ramp strategies also that doesn't specify them wanting the  OTK

[2023-01-02 01:41:35] <%+The_monster_hunter> @Xeath5 the fact that they specifically said its a play pattern they don't like means they don't like the OTK

[2023-01-02 02:19:55] <Jimmy_Page_> type 1 if u actually tried breast milk in the office fridge
[2023-01-02 02:19:57] <%+Valistin14> Wekk
[2023-01-02 02:19:57] VIEWERS: 777
[2023-01-02 02:19:58] <authorJeMac> Why would you increase the dmg?
[2023-01-02 02:20:02] <Jimmy_Page_> 1
[2023-01-02 02:20:02] <JakeTheDoggo_> but rogue can make a 12/12 on turn 4 while drawing and developing value, I think it's fair :)
[2023-01-02 02:20:07] <%+Verdyn_HS> That Renethal is going to be so much tempo!

[2023-01-02 02:20:28] <authorJeMac> It's really not. Druid does 64 in its OTK
[2023-01-02 02:20:33] <5ftHax> have fun with those mirrors
[2023-01-02 02:20:34] <%+Valistin14> we honestly need 100hp
[2023-01-02 02:20:43] <fuscello> As an otk enjoyer, so give me 50 health please
[2023-01-02 02:20:44] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> 100 health and you can play every card in your deck
[2023-01-02 02:20:47] <%nerazzurri_> @authorjemac ok so aggro would just never exist?
[2023-01-02 02:20:49] <authorJeMac> I liked Renethal
[2023-01-02 02:21:00] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ It still would.
[2023-01-02 02:21:16] <greggirs> I know things
[2023-01-02 02:21:24] <%nerazzurri_> no, aggro decks wouldn‚Äôt exist with 50 hp baseline lol
[2023-01-02 02:21:24] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ 50 health Hunter is gonna murder people LUL
[2023-01-02 02:21:24] <brockmalkmus> it is actually really funny how many people said renathal was a garbage 4fun card on release
[2023-01-02 02:21:27] <%+Valistin14> Most people can't count past 10, basically what you're saying no hands
[2023-01-02 02:21:30] <%+Valistin14> :D
[2023-01-02 02:21:31] <Jimmy_Page_> 0 mana and popped off
[2023-01-02 02:21:32] <%+Antonbrehbrahbruh> lol
[2023-01-02 02:21:33] <+chuuwire> I genuinely believe prenerf renethal is healthier than this shit
[2023-01-02 02:21:37] <5ftHax> casual rogue turn 4
[2023-01-02 02:21:44] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ Dude... you really don't grasp how much dmg is in the game now
[2023-01-02 02:21:57] <%+GuildChatter> This boards are ridiculous.
[2023-01-02 02:21:58] VIEWERS: 804
[2023-01-02 02:22:06] <purdos> it was nerfed, clearly this is fine Kappa
[2023-01-02 02:22:06] <+lafulive> Problem is tempo. There‚Äôs way too many ways to cheat mana and do massive plays in 1 turn early in the game. Clear gaping imbalances between the classes
[2023-01-02 02:22:12] <%+Citybuilder45> @NoHandsGamer Increased cortisol levels contribute to shorter lifespans
[2023-01-02 02:22:12] <+Mungo4u> I was about to give an example of a board that looks like this but their hand would be empty
[2023-01-02 02:22:17] <greggirs> yesssss let the hate consume you
[2023-01-02 02:22:18] <fuscello> I feel like no matter what you play, you should at least acknowledge that every type of deck needs to exist and renathal was the only reason control was playable
[2023-01-02 02:22:18] <%nerazzurri_> @authorjemac you would just play a combo deck always over aggro. phylactery, ramp druid etc
[2023-01-02 02:22:21] <+hokagedohs> this is confusing me
[2023-01-02 02:22:24] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> rogue mirrors are fun at least Sadge just pretend other classes don't exist
[2023-01-02 02:22:29] <%BabyRage_HS> how would you nerf rogue? @NoHandsGamer
[2023-01-02 02:22:34] <%culleexus> dont worry they will nerf the 10 most popular cards and then buff rogue in a week or two :)
[2023-01-02 02:22:38] [Notification] drateew subscribed with Prime.
[2023-01-02 02:22:40] <%+Valistin14> Druid is 0% winrate

[2023-01-02 02:22:53] <%+Verdyn_HS> Only had to take 25 damage to get to play it.
[2023-01-02 02:22:54] <%diantestpeter> Why don't you play rogue, like J_alex?
[2023-01-02 02:22:59] <curtarc> Really hope the balance patch arrives next week. VS was saying the 24th, but that would be some painful weeks
[2023-01-02 02:23:01] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ Not really. The only OTK deck that can 1 shot kill 50 health is Druid. And if that's the outlier it'll get nerfed
[2023-01-02 02:23:05] <%+GuildChatter> VS was right telling high legend players that it'll be painful for the next couple of weeks.
[2023-01-02 02:23:09] <%+Darkthunder119> this sub train actually offers subs to eat
[2023-01-02 02:23:11] <Zaxlor> @BabyRage_HS Just have a blanket statement that says "No card can have it's cost reduced by (1)"
[2023-01-02 02:23:21] <5ftHax> rogue or dh
[2023-01-02 02:23:26] <Jimmy_Page_> i think u won

[2023-01-02 02:26:02] <+rjones800> everyone agrees that rogue and dh need to be nerfed, but i haven't seen any specific suggestions.  what needs to be changed?
[2023-01-02 02:26:08] <diegofabiano_dev> hi hands Whats up?
[2023-01-02 02:26:08] <brockmalkmus> they added a class to give rogue new class cards to play with obv
[2023-01-02 02:26:10] <@%StarFox_SNES> Added Death knight.  Deleted Warrior.
[2023-01-02 02:26:14] <+Ninjamonkcy> It's always Roguestone, Druidstone, Shamanstone, maybe Demon Hunterstone. Always.
[2023-01-02 02:26:16] <curtarc> Rogue can have everything, but god forbig Warrior gets From the Depths reverted because Warrior is not supposed to cheat mana
[2023-01-02 02:26:17] <hstraxamillion> meati was at this stage of the grief cycle. he moved forward and is now at acceptance; spamming rogue games
[2023-01-02 02:26:22] <+chuuwire> @BabyRage_HS has to be one of the worst in the last 3 years
[2023-01-02 02:26:26] <paulschafer_xd> @NoHandsGamer try secret mage, playing objection and explosives runes against DH it's amazing LULW
[2023-01-02 02:26:30] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ They can nerf it tho. I played that back when it was Owl Lock LUL
[2023-01-02 02:26:48] <%BabyRage_HS> DH/Rogue lepSUFFER
[2023-01-02 02:27:00] <fuscello> Warrior didn‚Äôt get any good cards this year just because they got from the depths in the first exp
[2023-01-02 02:27:01] <+chuuwire> I hated stormwind meta, but i'd take stormwind over this any day

[2023-01-02 02:27:14] <%+Verdyn_HS> Warrior and Priest are only allowed to lose. Kappa

[2023-01-02 02:27:22] <+jerry_34_> @rjones800 nerf graveyard, edwin, concoctions, and trickster
[2023-01-02 02:27:43] <%nerazzurri_> @authorjemac you could probably even run zola brann for devourer tamsin with 50 HP lol
[2023-01-02 02:27:50] <+chuuwire> just noticed its luna
[2023-01-02 02:27:50] <authorJeMac> Better Ancient Watcher :)
[2023-01-02 02:27:52] <%+Xeath5> my nerf idea would be
[2023-01-02 02:27:59] <%+Xeath5> make the cocs neutral for every class
[2023-01-02 02:28:00] <hstraxamillion> concoctions prob won't get nerfed because rogue loses everything else at rotation
[2023-01-02 02:28:00] <brockmalkmus> @paulschafer_xd sounds good in theory, but i play fel DH vs a secret mage and still won without playing a minion, just burn and brand of sin

[2023-01-02 02:28:08] <%+Xeath5> just remove the other classes sets and replace it with the rogue set 5Head
[2023-01-02 02:28:23] <%+Valistin14> I think potion belt should be nerfed by instead of mixing the conc, they should just spawn two seperate ones

[2023-01-02 02:28:39] <%+Darkthunder119> i have the best nerf idea guys. make the concs give +1 attack to your pirates.
[2023-01-02 02:28:39] <+chuuwire> when luna isn't playing druid, you know the meta is crazy
[2023-01-02 02:28:41] <authorJeMac> @nerazzurri_ Doubt Lock could be that greedy. You wouldn't want to be anyway. You'd just run even more draw LUL

[2023-01-02 02:29:13] <HighEndOfLove> !demonhunter
[2023-01-02 02:29:14] <%+Xeath5> the card would only see play in arena and people would tilt

[2023-01-02 02:29:40] <hstraxamillion> concoctions in a vacuum aren't op, it's the interaction with gnolls and enabling sinstone popoffs

[2023-01-02 02:30:50] <+chuuwire> @hstraxamillion the double destroy high roll can be pretty stupid imo for rogue
[2023-01-02 02:30:51] <swiftstreak1> some spell that's like 3 mana your hero takes 5 damage, your opponent discards 2 random card might help with that
[2023-01-02 02:30:52] <%abandonment7> @ph788 if you mouse over your deck, you can see how many cards are in your deck and your hand

[2023-01-02 02:31:45] <hstraxamillion> @chuuwire in a vacuum it costs 5 mana and has rng element. not much diff from asphyxiate. also boon matchup is unplayable without it

[2023-01-02 02:50:10] <Zaxlor> @mahkanu It's easy. Just drink a lot, be a total womaniser and if you kill someone say "I've got a license for that" Kappa

[2023-01-02 02:52:01] <+chandleriab> @dextermorganfreeman I always meditated the wrong way and always thought it was was something people said would work but doesnt. Once i got into guided mediations and actually understood how to do it properly, it opened my eyes
[2023-01-02 02:52:03] <%+Xeath5> @djohnn98 this is his 6th game with this list
[2023-01-02 02:52:07] <fuscello> I never tried meditating, but now and then I find some philosophical argument to think about for some minutes
[2023-01-02 02:52:13] <+chuuwire> would removing s'thenos immune just kill the card entirely?

[2023-01-02 02:53:17] <%JonsyBones> Why corporal? Inquiring minds demand to know.

[2023-01-02 03:23:05] <+AComcastEmployee> i never thought i would look back to night of the frozen throne era and kinda miss when they never nerfed anything. Maybe im wrong, but it feels like the overnerfing has sapped quite a bit of fun from the game

[2023-01-02 03:24:19] <%diantestpeter> No music is a good decision
[2023-01-02 03:24:21] <%jobraz27> @acomcastemployee hard disagree, the only problem with nerfing more often is that it increases the chance of bad nerfs that impact negatively the meta.. but no change for 3 months is disgustingly bad

[2023-01-02 03:33:52] <+reaperonetho> bro the liver king is a pretty sad individual
[2023-01-02 03:33:55] <%+Xeath5> thats like the bike guy who gets shit on when everyone does it KEKW

[2023-01-02 03:34:00] <5ftHax> the thing is the organs are actually really healthy for you obviously not raw but they are very expensive

[2023-01-02 03:34:04] <goodlad1000> Liver king is different since he sold stuff because of steroids

[2023-01-02 03:34:53] <5ftHax> probably
[2023-01-02 03:35:17] <+reaperonetho> @snackpacc  he does roids and he alwais eat liver, so yes
[2023-01-02 03:35:19] <%+lexol23> true
[2023-01-02 03:35:19] <IronfistHS> if you do roids, just don't say you're natural
[2023-01-02 03:35:34] <grimBleeper> @snackpacc branding. same as why alistar overeem was eating horse meat while on super steroids

[2023-01-02 03:45:42] <paradoxymorphone> @blastboys123 highly dependent on the subtype of education
[2023-01-02 03:45:55] <zeroxhaust> @blastboys123 this is true, but it's more correlation than causation
[2023-01-02 03:46:11] <ScarecrowCR> education is generally the ticket to get a job or something that will earn your living. you can get certificates etc. that also work or even just online courses.

[2023-01-02 03:47:33] <zeroxhaust> @blastboys123 It's not a coincidence. It's correlation. The book "the case against education" is worth reading if you want to dive into the details.

[2023-01-02 03:47:35] <+IFNPZ> speaking as a college educator, the massive push for people to go to college no matter what is absolute BS. At this point most degrees act as a form of "entry tickets" for some jobs rather than an actual education

[2023-01-02 04:13:11] <%+Xeath5> btw did you ever look at the custom cards bunny made ?@NoHandsGamer
[2023-01-02 04:13:40] <+DebatableAwesome> @darkthunder119 you will literally never play hs then lol
[2023-01-02 04:13:46] <authorJeMac> LUL
[2023-01-02 04:13:46] <%+Darkthunder119> Sadge
[2023-01-02 04:13:51] <+fitspire> I like the meta because, while being canceer, at least it's fast paced cancer
[2023-01-02 04:14:03] <%+Darkthunder119> Honestly, i love early december thought it was good. I liked the Deathrattle rogues too didnt mind
[2023-01-02 04:14:06] <+fitspire> imagine if Blood DK was S tier
[2023-01-02 04:14:18] <%+Darkthunder119> EXACTLY beginning was amazing
[2023-01-02 04:14:19] <%+Xeath5> i realized something today
[2023-01-02 04:14:29] <JewFye> rotation will save us COPIUM
[2023-01-02 04:14:29] <%+Xeath5> when people say they want a fast meta they are not saying the truth
[2023-01-02 04:14:30] <%+The_monster_hunter> DR Rogue was a bit overtuned
[2023-01-02 04:14:36] <%+Xeath5> i got rope lethaled by so many rogues today
[2023-01-02 04:14:43] <%+Xeath5> they just want easy free wins not fast games
[2023-01-02 04:14:53] VIEWERS: 924
[2023-01-02 04:14:53] <%+Xeath5> they wouldnt bm that hard and waste time if they wanted fast games
[2023-01-02 04:14:54] <mightyergoTV> blizzard nerfs just kill the fun of the game and expansion piece by piece
[2023-01-02 04:15:00] <%+Antonbrehbrahbruh> there are the chess players and the checkers players Kappa
[2023-01-02 04:15:00] <%+Darkthunder119> they need to stop competing with Marvel Snap. Snap does not have longevity. most of us got bored didnt we. lol
[2023-01-02 04:15:01] <Demobalderes> I'm playing wild till this goes away YEP fuck it
[2023-01-02 04:15:03] <Demobalderes> KEKBye
[2023-01-02 04:15:04] <grimBleeper> @fitspire i kinda like it too because as long as i don't get tilted then i keep banging out 5 minute games but i also feel bad for people who don't enjoy it Sadge
[2023-01-02 04:15:09] <i_wraith_x> They did murder Renethal and warrior.  Those were the two sins they committed.  Otherwise I'm really enjoying the game right now.
[2023-01-02 04:15:38] <%+Citybuilder45> I loved playing D6 warlock
[2023-01-02 04:15:42] <authorJeMac> They murdered Deathrattle Rogue it that's any consolation LUL
[2023-01-02 04:15:42] <SethyGeez> Poor warrior
[2023-01-02 04:15:42] <%+Citybuilder45> That was a fun meta
[2023-01-02 04:15:48] <+gabsoliver> Is Quest DH the best deck rn?
[2023-01-02 04:15:49] <%+The_monster_hunter> Murdering Renathal in that same patch confuses the fuck out of me
[2023-01-02 04:16:03] <%+Darkthunder119> Yeah just deleted EVERY deathrattle rogue card. like legit EVERY SINGLE ONE lol.
[2023-01-02 04:16:28] <Demobalderes> I don't get why they wanted Frost DK to be relevant and not blood which does want Renathal
[2023-01-02 04:16:30] <Demobalderes> Seems abitrary
[2023-01-02 04:16:31] <authorJeMac> I bet people who crafted Invincible for Deathrattle Rogue are PISSED
[2023-01-02 04:16:36] <Demobalderes> I guess frost had more potential, but still
[2023-01-02 04:16:37] <%+dontneednickname> why glugg colossals goes to right and priest colossal goes to left? kinds stupid question but curious
[2023-01-02 04:16:39] <%+Citybuilder45> I think they should rotate the priest and warrior out of standard Kappa
[2023-01-02 04:16:42] <%+Darkthunder119> @authorJeMac KEKW
[2023-01-02 04:16:43] <grimBleeper> yeah but it's cheap so it'll have a place in the arsenals of f2p players
[2023-01-02 04:16:45] <Bilwitz> These decks were tier 1 preRenathal nerf anyway
[2023-01-02 04:16:53] <+earshs> in general its a resource based class which means on average it's inherently tougher to be great
[2023-01-02 04:16:53] <mightyergoTV> Frost mage is a better frost DK
[2023-01-02 04:16:53] VIEWERS: 949
[2023-01-02 04:16:58] <hstraxamillion> maybe the dh is the problem but
[2023-01-02 04:17:09] <Judisca> WutFace rogue value pls
[2023-01-02 04:17:12] <i_wraith_x> Rogue is a tough cookie, true.
[2023-01-02 04:17:15] <%+Darkthunder119> Blood was so bad into Druid and other late game pop off decks. I liked blood. only good at board centric :)
[2023-01-02 04:17:28] <chrisccd2018> KEKWait
[2023-01-02 04:17:29] <authorJeMac> Bloods better against Druid since the nerf.
[2023-01-02 04:17:31] <hstraxamillion> frost dk running 2 of the 4 mana weapon at the very least goes even with no drakka rogue
[2023-01-02 04:17:35] <%purple_funk_> Just popping in to say Happy New Year @nohandsgamer ! nohandsHappy
[2023-01-02 04:17:38] <%+Xeath5> blood is kind of ok now into 30 card druid
[2023-01-02 04:17:38] <+earshs> atleast rogue is skill intensive as a best deck
[2023-01-02 04:17:38] <grimBleeper> you can climb as blood in wild because of all the dedicated aggro decks :]
[2023-01-02 04:17:39] <hstraxamillion> prob beats rogue
[2023-01-02 04:17:40] <%+saa_soli> the first time i matched to blood dk as scythe dh i decided i wasn't going to play anything else. not being scared of patchwerk was amazing
[2023-01-02 04:17:50] <authorJeMac> But all DK is pretty Sadge
[2023-01-02 04:17:51] <%+Darkthunder119> maybe thats what i do this season
[2023-01-02 04:17:57] <%+Darkthunder119> chat convincing me to play wild LUL
[2023-01-02 04:18:07] <+eduhw> I thought egg priest was dead
[2023-01-02 04:18:14] <authorJeMac> Xyrella. Turn his Astalors into 4/4
[2023-01-02 04:18:17] <i_wraith_x> @Demobalderes plague is what really infuses renethal.  Blood doesn't drop as many minions by far.
[2023-01-02 04:18:22] <%berkiee> @eduhw nh did cpr
[2023-01-02 04:18:23] <grimBleeper> @eduhw Kappa read the text, egg is undead

[2023-01-02 04:19:09] <+fitspire> whats your opinion on disruption?
[2023-01-02 04:19:13] <Juanmaa_> No More Mida?
[2023-01-02 04:19:13] <grimBleeper> @reaperonetho absorbs demon hunter spells and stheno attacks
[2023-01-02 04:19:13] <SethyGeez> What‚Äôs the purpose of the corporal in this deck?
[2023-01-02 04:19:50] <%+Xeath5> thats what makes me cringe the most when people say "rogue is skill intensiv"
[2023-01-02 04:19:58] <icarpediemz> decent hot take
[2023-01-02 04:20:02] <%+Xeath5> like we would be playing murloc shaman and pirate warrior if it wasnt for rogue KEKW
[2023-01-02 04:20:04] <+fitspire> @NoHandsGamer but how did HS go without or very very few disruption cars for so long ?
[2023-01-02 04:20:25] <Jimmy_Page_> nh in its prime would dr rogue beat current rogue
[2023-01-02 04:20:29] <%berkiee> top 10 not good enough for me
[2023-01-02 04:20:39] <grimBleeper> @fitspire lower power level
