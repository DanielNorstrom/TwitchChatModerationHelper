[2022-12-25 14:58:10] <+zimbovsky> I think they are teasing the patchnotes, every event relates to changes in .13. Like, fast leveling skills -> skills rework, green flare -> antlerman, loot change -> loot rework and so on
[2022-12-25 14:58:12] <+sinisterous_foori> yes escalator

[2022-12-25 15:16:45] <itshadesfr> my guess is 27th or 26th maybe
[2022-12-25 15:16:53] <!%$leonikk> 26th would be perfect
[2022-12-25 15:16:57] <SniperPierce> max level for weapon trouble shooting is op you don't have to inspect the weapon just clear malfunction

[2022-12-25 15:36:15] <!%+ItzPyroGG> they should make a BR event, a zone closing so pvp focusses actually in one area Kappa
[2022-12-25 15:36:15] <+vihanenlintu> @EXZS_mL no
[2022-12-25 15:36:18] <savage_rn> yeah but he said "near" and its almost a month later
[2022-12-25 15:36:19] <Smithin> The events were fun for me, but more than 7 without them wiping has been annoying
[2022-12-25 15:36:20] <%+Kaines> i mean we know that since nikita said wipe is near i guess
[2022-12-25 15:36:23] <+EXZS_mL> sadly
[2022-12-25 15:36:24] <%XinegoPombo> 100% reshala spwan ?
[2022-12-25 15:36:26] <myyyneral> i would like to see the events be throughout the wipe rather than at the last week of it
[2022-12-25 15:36:33] <savage_rn> he needs to learn the definition of "near"
[2022-12-25 15:36:41] <kupu987> What day are we realistically looking at for the wipe?
[2022-12-25 15:36:44] <+vihanenlintu> have you tested the new flare @Axel_tv
[2022-12-25 15:36:47] <dunnudunn88888> wipe 26th is my guess

[2022-12-25 17:24:35] <imadethisnameup1> thing is some cheaters you don't even know, some lvl up accs and max them out just to sell them for profit, rinse and repeat. Not everyone is there to ruin the lobby
[2022-12-25 17:24:43] <+cellyisdead> this one of the few games where a lot of good players can beat cheaters

[2022-12-25 17:27:41] <Rufioo> @Venom254 How did you read what I said and come to the conclusion that I dont think cheaters exist? Sounds like you know about brain damage first hand.
[2022-12-25 17:27:41] <+og_no_game_sense> would it be possible to use the green flare to get the scavs and check on them ?
[2022-12-25 17:27:43] <WARD0GGY_> when wipeeeeee
[2022-12-25 17:27:43] <%bfcheg> are you sure gl scavs can spawn on factory?

[2022-12-25 17:27:57] <+joblessraccoon> if anything i feel like cheaters hate streamers so idek if they're even watching any streams - if they do they probably do it to stream snipe so they can feel better about their filthy life

[2022-12-25 18:27:10] <%mefinek> when reserve came out i got 60 fps LUL
[2022-12-25 18:27:16] <+TheAntaresHD> it jumps around on certain maps quite considerably on certain maps between the 80 - 100fps mark

[2022-12-25 18:29:03] <DNIwE_041> @potatoempire19 It's not because more fps = less input lag, you just got more fresh frame if you fps higher than refresh rate

[2022-12-25 18:30:44] <matejlipton_> more frames is literally less input lag, limit your fps to 60 and play csgo and then u cap your fps and see the difference
[2022-12-25 18:31:07] <%cwissttv> but going from 50 average to 130 is enough

[2022-12-25 18:31:47] <+Tryhard_Reedy> input lag will also depend on your monitor's response time

[2022-12-25 18:32:13] <%lonesomekiller> @honda0912 part of it
[2022-12-25 18:32:18] <%Qweets> @Tryhard_Reedy don't oled monitors have 0.3ms response?
[2022-12-25 18:32:23] <potatoempire19> Having more fps than you can see on screen doesn‚Äôt give you less input lag. If your screen is a 244 hz monitor and youre pulling 350 frames your monitor is only showing 244 frames. On bad games this leads to tearing
[2022-12-25 18:32:31] <%cwissttv> @Axel_tv take a look in ur discord, im definitly happy with my current tarkov stash

[2022-12-25 19:46:03] <@%^Nightbot> @youezzyttv  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-25 21:45:45] <OPQuick> did bsg say anything about making the UI on friends and chat better?
[2022-12-25 21:45:50] VIEWERS: 953
[2022-12-25 21:46:01] <foreveralonell> you just bind them to slot 5-9 and shoot
[2022-12-25 21:46:01] <!%+ItzPyroGG> @OPQuick what UI?
[2022-12-25 21:46:08] <Heckmannovic> So if they havent made as tweet tonight, does that mean no wipe tomorrow?

[2022-12-25 21:46:21] <prbuchiha> would you say its easier to make money this wipe?
[2022-12-25 21:46:29] <%bfcheg> @OPQuick if only they gave a shit about our experiense lmao
[2022-12-25 21:46:39] <foreveralonell> @Bish_KeK big reds you shoot out of hand, need pistol just for small ones

[2022-12-25 21:46:54] <!%+ItzPyroGG> @OPQuick there wont be changes to this, the only thing thats gonna change is the grouping with friends. so you dont have to invite friends every raid anymore, you stay in a group
[2022-12-25 21:47:12] <Nekkeeh> i want the wipe to happen soon, hope tomorrow but just seems bit unlikely
[2022-12-25 21:47:13] <Bish_KeK> @foreveralonell mhm, ive fired off other colours before, just never felt safe enough to do reds LUL
[2022-12-25 21:47:27] <foreveralonell> @Bish_KeK XD the fact is that others have no use atm
[2022-12-25 21:47:29] <Nekkeeh> but then again its bsg and they can always wipe tomorrow
[2022-12-25 21:47:31] <foreveralonell> only red do

[2022-12-25 21:48:07] <Bish_KeK> @foreveralonell mhm, ive fired em off trying to hit scavs with it before KEKW
[2022-12-25 21:48:13] <Bish_KeK> mostly the plain white ones
