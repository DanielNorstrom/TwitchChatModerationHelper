[2023-01-08 10:56:47] <%PanicRush> @Taylor131313 will 14 give me 18 points? i have +12 timed
[2023-01-08 10:56:54] <%Taylor131313> yes
[2023-01-08 10:57:08] <%PanicRush> no way pepeWTF how does it work?
[2023-01-08 10:57:21] <%Taylor131313> idk but it's enough
[2023-01-08 10:57:52] <%PanicRush> for comparison i had academy 11, did 13 and it gave me +7 points
[2023-01-08 10:58:07] <%PanicRush> why would stepping up from 12 to 14 give more?
[2023-01-08 11:00:57] <%Swiggyswoo_> Depends on how well you time the 14
[2023-01-08 11:02:01] <%Taylor131313> idk I got like 30 points from taking jade from 12 to 15
[2023-01-08 11:03:02] <%PanicRush> i mean, i can try but i have doubts it will give me 18 points
[2023-01-08 11:17:30] <%PanicRush> is it possible to disable silverdragon for some zones?
[2023-01-08 11:17:42] <%PanicRush> because flying from dalaran to hov is WAYTOODANK

[2023-01-08 11:22:35] <%Taylor131313> I wonder, changing details name to xddcute increased my damage yesterday, does changing it to xdd531531205982039582309582590382509285580950923509385092590820 increase trinket chance?
[2023-01-08 11:22:38] <%Taylor131313> only one way to know
[2023-01-08 11:23:05] <%Geoffku> dc'ed on login to valdrakken

[2023-01-08 11:33:20] <%Taylor131313> ok I found a weakaura that makes details ignore nickname size so I renamed to xdd531531205982039582309582590382509285580950923509385092590820

[2023-01-08 11:58:35] <%PanicRush> +21 points
[2023-01-08 11:58:39] <%PanicRush> i dont understand how this works
[2023-01-08 11:58:44] <%Taylor131313> told you
[2023-01-08 11:58:54] <%PanicRush> why did academy only give +7?
[2023-01-08 11:58:56] <%Taylor131313> they changed it for DF so I'm not really sure either xddgarlic
[2023-01-08 11:59:16] <%Taylor131313> because it wasn't your highest overall key I suppose
[2023-01-08 11:59:35] <%Taylor131313> you brought an 11** to a 13 depleto on tyrannical, and you had a timed 13 on fortified
[2023-01-08 12:00:19] <%Taylor131313> in SL each key level was 7.5 points if it was your highest, but in DF it's more
[2023-01-08 12:01:02] <%PanicRush> well whatever, no point playing the game till next season now

[2023-01-08 12:32:56] <%JurgenRapp> wow seems horrible, the hardest part in wow seems to be to be able to play the game
[2023-01-08 12:33:17] <%JurgenRapp> always queues and not getting invites etc..
[2023-01-08 12:35:01] <%$Hasan_Lurker> peepoMongbat /
[2023-01-08 12:36:06] <%JurgenRapp> so hentai pussy 3 seems like the way to go

[2023-01-08 12:39:58] <%JurgenRapp> maybe Annie can have a giveaway
[2023-01-08 12:40:10] <%JurgenRapp> or a sponsored segment
[2023-01-08 12:42:14] <%JurgenRapp> I think that's a soloqueue game
[2023-01-08 12:42:53] <%drzaius30> ConcernFroge
[2023-01-08 12:45:07] <%PanicRush> its a slide-puzzle game, surely she can beat it in 1 stream YEP

[2023-01-08 13:06:29] <%JurgenRapp> Oceania to EU is like 300+ ms I guess it would be hard to play on EU servers
[2023-01-08 13:06:59] <%JurgenRapp> don't know what the Oceania to NA ping is though
[2023-01-08 13:09:23] <%JurgenRapp> about 200 perhaps
[2023-01-08 13:11:44] <%Geoffku> I have 300ms exactly on EU right now
[2023-01-08 13:12:01] <%Geoffku> to NA it's more like 200 ye
[2023-01-08 13:12:42] <%drzaius30> AAAA patch 6.4 is going to come out around the exact same time as zelda and ff16
[2023-01-08 13:13:16] <%JurgenRapp> peepoAwesome
[2023-01-08 13:13:57] <%drzaius30> take holidays sometime in that part of the year NOTED
[2023-01-08 13:13:59] <%Geoffku> it's basically impossible to play optimally at 300 LUL 200 is much more bearable
[2023-01-08 13:14:47] <%JurgenRapp> Sadge
[2023-01-08 13:15:03] <%Geoffku> worth it to play with the community tho
[2023-01-08 13:15:26] <%JurgenRapp> I totally understand that, wow seems to suck if you don't have a community
[2023-01-08 13:16:20] <%$Hasan_Lurker> anniesSole
[2023-01-08 13:16:24] <%PanicRush> it is true
[2023-01-08 13:16:30] <%JurgenRapp> But at the same time I guess that's also whats makes the game good blessing and a curse
[2023-01-08 13:16:54] <%PanicRush> i mean, you still have things to do alone, but long term it sucks to be a solo player
[2023-01-08 13:17:09] <%Geoffku> ye never really enjoyed it much as solo
[2023-01-08 13:17:18] <%PanicRush> i've been playing like this since WoD pretty much because most of my frens that i've played together before have quit
[2023-01-08 13:17:29] <%Geoffku> each time I've gotten really into wow was because I had fun people to play with
[2023-01-08 13:17:50] <%PanicRush> playing actively for 1-2 months, then quit for half a year, come back for another 1-2 months with a new patch/expansion, rinse and repeat
[2023-01-08 13:18:11] <%Geoffku> basically me after wrath panic LUL
[2023-01-08 13:18:25] <%PanicRush> understandable
[2023-01-08 13:18:27] <%drzaius30> I have never played a game for other people ever
[2023-01-08 13:18:46] <%PanicRush> its not FOR other people, its that without other people you burn out faster
[2023-01-08 13:18:46] <%drzaius30> don't think im wired that way
[2023-01-08 13:18:52] <%Geoffku> exactly panic
[2023-01-08 13:19:12] <%PanicRush> like i've said, i've been coming back to the game over and over even solo, because i wanted to play it and enjoyed it
[2023-01-08 13:20:07] <%Geoffku> ye it's fun to play ofc but I need good people to play with or I'll just wanna move on to something else after a little while
[2023-01-08 13:20:23] <%PanicRush> exactly
[2023-01-08 13:20:42] <%JurgenRapp> keys and m+ and all that must be so much more fun to do with people you know
[2023-01-08 13:20:50] <%PanicRush> kinda same in gw2 tbh, but there you dont need to pay for subscription at least
[2023-01-08 13:21:08] <%JurgenRapp> I only did solo stuff in gw2
[2023-01-08 13:21:48] <%PanicRush> there is a lot of solo stuff to do
[2023-01-08 13:21:51] <%JurgenRapp> and then only doing solo stuff in games like that it feels you are missing out on so much of the good content
[2023-01-08 13:21:52] <%PanicRush> a lot more than in wow
[2023-01-08 13:22:07] <%JurgenRapp> yeah ok, so mainly a wow thing then
[2023-01-08 13:22:38] <%wesjer250> live on bot Pog

[2023-01-08 14:29:15] <%Taylor131313> do we count as smaller group if we play with the smol herself?

[2023-01-08 14:31:01] <%Collnaris> i hate getting knocked around
[2023-01-08 14:31:06] <%BrendanK> Council is great
[2023-01-08 14:31:15] <%Mirkooo> Council as ranged isnt too bad, but i can imagine it as melee xdd
[2023-01-08 14:31:29] <%PanicRush> that will be trivial
[2023-01-08 14:31:29] <%Collnaris> the only thing i hate about council is when people walk over me with their circles peepoOkay
[2023-01-08 14:31:30] <%Makkan780> i also hope they fix that wierd lag on the first boss
[2023-01-08 14:31:36] <!%Aegis_2566> then it is too easy yea

[2023-01-08 18:04:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> You run after it LUL
[2023-01-08 18:04:08] <%Mirkooo> If everyone is between the 2 pillars he will land on the platform
[2023-01-08 18:04:13] <+kc_rad> I havent played wow since the beginning of shadowlands... alwasy been a warlock main.. is it super different now? @AnnieFuchsia
[2023-01-08 18:04:20] <%Swiggyswoo_> Yes
[2023-01-08 18:04:26] <+thechzburglar> if the tank keeps the human target in the middle of the arena, it forces the dragon to land
[2023-01-08 18:04:36] <%Swiggyswoo_> You want the dragon as low as possible before 2nd phase
[2023-01-08 18:04:43] <ikillzya> Trust me there is no other way to kill this boss in tyranical
[2023-01-08 18:04:43] <%Swiggyswoo_> So you run after it in 1st phase
[2023-01-08 18:04:59] <%Collnaris> ah shit
[2023-01-08 18:05:03] <%Swiggyswoo_> This is 2nd phase
[2023-01-08 18:05:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> when he rides it
[2023-01-08 18:05:07] <%PanicRush> when the human riddes it
[2023-01-08 18:05:08] <%$loppish91> thats when the dude jump on the dragon
[2023-01-08 18:05:09] <+thechzburglar> second phase, the human mounts the dragon
[2023-01-08 18:05:23] <ikillzya> Just zerg Dragon and its free loot
[2023-01-08 18:05:26] <%Swiggyswoo_> When the dragon dies the fight is free, before then it's a race against time
[2023-01-08 18:05:28] <Azureynn> "the human" LUL
[2023-01-08 18:05:29] <+dapeanutbutter> i want that boss as mount, is it a mount?
[2023-01-08 18:05:31] <savarunl> ppl say that but much easier tactic is just to burn the guy on left side platform, then switch to right side when drake lands

[2023-01-08 18:05:38] <spartatronix> @PanicRush its troll :D
[2023-01-08 18:05:39] <%PanicRush> Nerdge aktshully its a troll and idk why we call it hooman
[2023-01-08 18:05:44] <%Swiggyswoo_> YEP
[2023-01-08 18:05:45] <+thechzburglar> the reason the dragon kept flying in the air, is because the tank was near the edge with the human target
[2023-01-08 18:05:53] <%$loppish91> i guess the longer it takes the more shit on ground there is?
[2023-01-08 18:05:53] <%Mausermann> they got this
[2023-01-08 18:06:03] <saacman2000> Err
[2023-01-08 18:06:07] <%Swiggyswoo_> The dragon still flies just ass much when youre in the middle
[2023-01-08 18:06:11] <%Mirkooo> Yeah ideally you want everyone close to the middle, so drake always lands during breath
[2023-01-08 18:06:13] <+thechzburglar> just keep human in the middle of the room, so of near the two pillars
[2023-01-08 18:06:15] <falafelmannen> no
[2023-01-08 18:06:22] <savarunl> yeah thats nonsense, drake just does not land till the guy is 50%
[2023-01-08 18:06:28] <%Collnaris> we seem to be having different answers now
[2023-01-08 18:06:29] <%Swiggyswoo_> The only difference is it lands in the middle instead of hugging the edge when it does the breath
[2023-01-08 18:06:33] <%Swiggyswoo_> Melee can still hit it on the edge tho
[2023-01-08 18:06:38] <%phoenixsong21488> Drake lands when either of them are 50%

[2023-01-08 18:06:50] <%Mirkooo> It lands during breath yes, then flies off again
[2023-01-08 18:06:50] <savarunl> no
[2023-01-08 18:06:57] <savarunl> either of them have to be 50%

[2023-01-08 18:08:25] <%Swiggyswoo_> For your question about nameplates annie, it's impossible to fix that in default frames. when theyre in the top 10% or so of your screen they get squished down so they overlap whether stacking is enabled or not

[2023-01-08 18:14:10] <%Collnaris> that red and pink is very similar
[2023-01-08 18:14:11] <%Swiggyswoo_> so you wont see that

[2023-01-08 18:16:16] <%Geoffku> you could probably easily adjust the colours

[2023-01-08 19:10:56] <%NayruHD> going to 10 stacks is basically mandatory on high tyrannical keys
[2023-01-08 19:10:57] <Littlechop25> Do you pvp as demo too? If so what are your thoughts on the nerf coming to demonic strength and will that change your build any?
[2023-01-08 19:11:03] <%Turbopumper> I just follow the yaungol and attack what he's attacking monkaa
[2023-01-08 19:11:17] <+v3suve> what addon for the group interupts?
[2023-01-08 19:11:17] <+thechzburglar> normal strat is let one ad get to 7 stacks, then switch to other add and repeat

[2023-01-08 19:12:19] <%+snagprophet> I think what i find annoying about demo is that the summoned demons don't last long
[2023-01-08 19:12:33] <%BrendanK> does more damage if not hit to immune I think
[2023-01-08 19:12:40] <%BrendanK> but honestly never really sure with that boss
[2023-01-08 19:12:56] <%Mayder> im running 15-17 keys on this dungeon and it was always 6-7 stack swap, for pugs atleast
[2023-01-08 19:13:07] <%Swiggyswoo_> Going to immunity is way less damage taken for the group
[2023-01-08 19:13:17] <%Swiggyswoo_> Stopping on 6-7 lets dots tick but accidentally cleaving causes insane dmg
[2023-01-08 19:13:19] <Gren110> I just started playing lock, been using destruction, is demo easier than destruction?
[2023-01-08 19:13:29] <%Swiggyswoo_> So it's a balance between dps vs survivability

[2023-01-08 19:14:16] <%Swiggyswoo_> Yeah you always wanna pass it to the healer if possible

[2023-01-08 19:16:27] <%Swiggyswoo_> There's no standard to set though, if your group is pepega and accidentally cleave you have to take them to 10 stacks

[2023-01-08 19:17:32] <%NayruHD> @itsClubby its basically a question of if your healer can keep the group alive, going to 10 makes healer life way easier while going to 6-7 stacks and swapping is a bit higher damage cus aoe abilitesand auras can hit the second target without giving stacks

[2023-01-08 20:00:18] <jonnyh1994> I think if ban from solo queue account wide would work
[2023-01-08 20:00:21] <jonnyh1994> too
[2023-01-08 20:00:22] <+realtimmylly> its like me, when i do bad in life i just /afk and leave

[2023-01-08 20:00:23] <logan_blaskie> Can blizzard discern bw d/c and leaving?
[2023-01-08 20:00:23] <TristanAtLarge> It'll probably be suspensions over permas.

[2023-01-08 20:00:56] <jonnyh1994> @logan_blaskie There'd be a counter of how many leaves so 1 or 2 dc's should be fine imo?
