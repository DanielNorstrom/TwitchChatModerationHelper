[2022-12-20 23:00:42] <%GG_Cannon_> Momo, if you love peanut butter, check for Brazilian "Paçoca". It is like a velvety powdery peanut butter. It is like eating the interior of a Reese's chocolate by itself.
[2022-12-20 23:00:48] <%Frostwriter111> peanut butter is good on bagels for the same reason
