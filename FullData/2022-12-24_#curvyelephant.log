[2022-12-24 11:24:53] <!%Timmac> i just wanna be centered
[2022-12-24 11:25:03] <%mittensduck73> the middle or near back is best spot
[2022-12-24 11:25:09] <%Angelightx> back centered NODDERS
[2022-12-24 11:25:15] <%N8tefal> Yesterday i went to watch the new Avatar movie  :D
[2022-12-24 11:25:16] <%+GrandadM> sitting at the back means you get the best view of the screen
[2022-12-24 11:25:21] <ZombieAteMyPC> You are suppose to sit half the size of your tv away. So if its 24 inches you sit 12 feet away.

[2022-12-24 11:26:07] <+robert_etm> 3d is shit
[2022-12-24 11:26:13] <Dooderz> i just wish theaters cared more about their surround sound. shits never balanced or even mounted optimally half the fucking time in my neck of the woods
[2022-12-24 11:26:20] <+jacky_horse> For 3D and imax 3D I usually sit like 25% from right side because if more 3D effects
[2022-12-24 11:26:25] <%keREdaU> 3d at the movies is good. It sucks at home.

[2022-12-24 12:57:58] <+cyanAlpaca> I got a genuine question. Do officers have a cut off time on chases?
[2022-12-24 12:58:05] <%AkiBeojji> We have websites that tell us what and wherre is being fixed without needing to call too.
[2022-12-24 12:58:26] <+cyanAlpaca> Like will it go until they catch the person or do they eventually go "Aiight just let them coast we'll get them eventually"?
[2022-12-24 12:58:33] <%keREdaU> depends on the operator as to whether they have good outage automations
[2022-12-24 12:58:40] <@%nmussa> @cyanAlpaca Not really, they might call off a chase if they have something important happening though
[2022-12-24 12:58:40] <Lifeisastory> Same, but we arent marked as an outage so ii cant see anythin for me
[2022-12-24 12:58:55] <%keREdaU> some operators can tell based on smart meter information

[2022-12-24 12:59:17] <Lifeisastory> i know on part of the highway that at my city there was a 100 car pilrup so theyre working on all that as well
[2022-12-24 12:59:19] <+cyanAlpaca> @cyanAlpaca Okay, I always wondered because I've seen chases that go on for so long to the point where I'm like "Does the heli have gas?" LOL

[2022-12-24 13:41:51] <shatteredblade89> yea, twitch max bitrate is only 6mb/s
[2022-12-24 13:42:12] <%JibJibFlutterhous> his calls though make it seem like he's in the crim's head telling them where to turn
[2022-12-24 13:42:14] <@%nmussa> You can push it to 8 but you might get throttled/dropped frames

[2022-12-24 13:43:29] <shatteredblade89> i think it may be a obs issue honestly. xsplit does fine over 6.2
[2022-12-24 13:43:33] <+ImmaHoodieNinja> Morning Curvy and chat
[2022-12-24 13:44:05] <@%nmussa> You can record on OBS in lossless, having just a slightly higher bitrate shouldn't cause a crash unless you have an issue with your settings/drivers

[2022-12-24 13:45:58] <shatteredblade89> that was when i had the 2nd to most recent nvidia driver
[2022-12-24 13:46:22] <@%nmussa> I mean if Xplit works for you that's great, but OBS is solid NODDERS

[2022-12-24 15:44:46] <+pmonge__> @ImmaHoodieNinja How can he charge him? there is no way to know who is is? so hold untill he gets that info ? :D
[2022-12-24 15:45:01] <@%nmussa> He can get the information without holding him
[2022-12-24 15:45:08] <+ImmaHoodieNinja> he can hold him in the cells as long as it takes to get the info, but can't send him to a prison hold.
[2022-12-24 15:45:11] <Fenderz_> doctor can dna test cant they if they really wanna rp it

[2022-12-24 17:12:16] <+TurtleSonSoFun> What car do you have?
[2022-12-24 17:12:25] <+Stuish101> so helpful for heavy loads too in the trunk, not blinding anyone
[2022-12-24 17:12:26] <%original_khawk> back in the good old days you had a switch in the car from 0 to 3 to level your headlights depending on how much load you had in the car
[2022-12-24 17:12:29] <+forn21> The leveling is nice for oncoming cars too, you don't get blinded when the other car hits a bump
[2022-12-24 17:12:35] <%original_khawk> these days its all fancy and automatic

[2022-12-24 17:15:00] <%original_khawk> but since you all have no yearly inspections that need to be passed (other then emissions) no one gets their dang headlights adjusted curvyeDESKCHAN
[2022-12-24 17:15:15] <+Stuish101> the switch is next to the steering wheel, so you can adjust it on the move
