[2022-12-10 16:11:33] <%$xxTygar> if you have a line that goes straight from/to the sites with minimum corners and no road anarchy it might function correctly. however apparently it's actually just straight up better to make underground highway ramp roads.

[2022-12-10 16:53:17] <takorojo> This time it's cajun sauce on one and a serrano/poblano mix on the other.
[2022-12-10 16:53:32] <takorojo> One is red and one is green.  Very festive.
[2022-12-10 16:53:37] <modernvarus> Still losing over dons highway placement XD
[2022-12-10 16:53:46] <@^Streamlabs> Thank you for following Mr_Comma_!
[2022-12-10 16:53:52] <takorojo> Also, heater is fully fixed!  My cat and I are no longer cold.  :D
[2022-12-10 16:55:00] <takorojo> Ok, the Cajun is interesting.  Seems like it would be really good on seafood.

[2022-12-10 16:56:51] <takorojo> Oh yeah, and in the process of fixing the heater, I accidentally left it unplugged for a few hours.  Was wondering why it wasn't turned on.  It's amazing what a multimeter, a couple of screwdrivers, and a piece of wire can do in an emergency.

[2022-12-10 17:08:53] <takorojo> Remember that commercial zones generate noise, so you want to put office buildings as a buffer!
[2022-12-10 17:09:08] <takorojo> That is, if you're going to put them near residential.

[2022-12-10 17:13:45] <takorojo> OMG I looked at YouTube right now and there's an 8-hour "Brown Noise Remastered" video.  Why would anyone want to listen to the Brown Noise?
[2022-12-10 17:14:14] <takorojo> Pretty sure there was a South Park episode about that, and it's not pretty.
