[2022-12-27 19:27:52] <%$AlphaRabbit> @bobinsson The vehicle is useless through the pass
[2022-12-27 19:28:09] <%ynlokk> @bobinsson vehicles would be hard for this mission, because she needs to either pass a very rocky area, or climb a mountain
[2022-12-27 19:28:57] <%ynlokk> no worries Teru, every mission is an experience
[2022-12-27 19:29:16] <%$AlphaRabbit> Just take your time from on and the game will cakewalk. Stealth is your best friends in this game

[2022-12-27 23:38:43] <%Erickira> I have asked an AI what it mean when a pet bird is super loud and act randomly, and it said that it could be because they are scared. I am sorry to have scared you so much, I hope you'll be normal one day.
