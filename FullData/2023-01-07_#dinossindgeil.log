[2023-01-07 14:17:07] <%Ancillius> Yeah maybe poison mist or spells like that? I am no DS2 pro... so idk but the situation calls for that XD
[2023-01-07 14:17:14] <%ErrSousa> Yup
[2023-01-07 14:17:14] <%affuki> dont the enemies respawn? 🤔
[2023-01-07 14:17:17] <%+alexcon18> do you have the stone ring? maybe the extra poise break boost can stagger them when hitting them?
[2023-01-07 14:17:26] <%ErrSousa> They do respawn until your knights close the mirrors
[2023-01-07 14:17:33] <+kenzokizzo> kill the fire throwers first

[2023-01-07 14:18:51] <%affuki> thats what i said having all knights is alot better NODDERS

[2023-01-07 14:19:05] <%Hellem5> Yes
[2023-01-07 14:19:13] <%LittleWing322> you should get the 4th knight
[2023-01-07 14:19:18] <$Ripto_Rage> parry this knights Dino Kappa
[2023-01-07 14:19:23] <KarlGun_> maybe try another weapon with more poise dmg (or stone ring) to permastagger them while attackying
[2023-01-07 14:19:26] <%LCorazza> Gino had found a way to make them kill themselfs. But is not consistent
[2023-01-07 14:19:28] <%affuki> more knights and the doors will seal faster plus aggro sharing is easier @dinossindgeil
[2023-01-07 14:19:31] <+Barzonius> NODDERS This game is fair and reasonable

[2023-01-07 14:31:45] <%2604dimitri> maybe they intended the player to kill the enemies instead of running past them

[2023-01-07 14:32:26] <JIVEftw> crazy tht ds1 made it acceptable to just run past everything, and this one gets criticized for not letting u lmao

[2023-01-07 14:32:43] <%LCorazza> yes, they should't
[2023-01-07 14:32:44] <CLSheppard> That's what I don't like about ds 2. A lot of it is only "hard" because they threw in a lot of enemies.
[2023-01-07 14:32:54] <BigMightyena> @CLSheppard Exactly
[2023-01-07 14:32:57] <%+alexcon18> there is a guy on youtube, that always says that the game regarledd of challenges or not is the best and least flawed game, he even tries to justify the shitty hitboxes that some people put in compilations

[2023-01-07 15:05:00] <%LCorazza> you need to go back to the bonfire. The into the passage on the wall
[2023-01-07 15:05:08] <eRohwnz> I think you have to start from first bonfire, then instead of dropping down to The second bonfire, run straight forward

[2023-01-07 16:31:02] <%+Kittyhavoc> Objectively untrue the best boss fight is Lady Friede :)
[2023-01-07 16:31:05] <%+Kryptoguy95> Soul of Cinder is amazing, no doubt.
[2023-01-07 16:31:08] <Ninjahamster2k14> Just don't get hit Kappa
[2023-01-07 16:31:08] <%+bing0pajamas> if you can get the number advantage for whiteys that would be good, right?

[2023-01-07 16:31:24] <%+1naglfar1> mines gael
[2023-01-07 16:31:30] <flicter> the only "flaw" in soul of cinder is that some phases are WAY easier than others. Other than that is perfect
[2023-01-07 16:31:30] <%+Kryptoguy95> Pontiff Sulyvahn is my favorite I think
[2023-01-07 16:31:30] <The_Moses_Guy> Best 2nd phase ever for Friede KEKW

[2023-01-07 16:31:54] <%+Kittyhavoc> The spectacle, every phase looks unique and it's a very cruel twist with the 3-phase boss, she's unforgiving and puts on a show, uses black fire and frost both of which are beautiful and her dad is hilarious
[2023-01-07 16:31:57] <BoiledHotEgg> they need to add sex to this game
[2023-01-07 16:32:01] <LilithTheForgotten> @1naglfar1 I'd say Havel / Sorcerer / Lance / Hexer. It is personally the most overpowered build in the game for both defense and attack and will get you through the game easily. The Grand Lance is the best pve weapon in the game imo
[2023-01-07 16:32:02] <%ErrSousa> You can buff before falling down and go straight to this knighr

[2023-01-07 17:58:05] <%ErrSousa> @dinossindgeil But to be honest yea you are being too aggressive and your camera control is not the best yet. You gotta let the fight go on naturally at some point. Focus more and go for safer punishes.

[2023-01-07 17:58:59] <%ErrSousa> Having to go through the knights is very difficult and it does not help that you are not used to the main boss fight - IK
[2023-01-07 17:59:02] <%mbx220> dls are just artificially difficult

[2023-01-07 17:59:55] <%+remiri> i think the knights are trying to seal the portals and getting hit
[2023-01-07 17:59:57] <+guccideltaco> @dinossindgeil any tips for the ape in sekiro?
[2023-01-07 18:00:03] <%+remiri> if you defend them does the phase end faster
[2023-01-07 18:00:11] <%ErrSousa> @dinossindgeil When i did my SL1 playthrough i was good at the Ivory King itself. I spent hours practicing it for Hexes only AB. SL1 was really hard for me with the knights but the boss fight itself was easier because of that.
[2023-01-07 18:00:18] <%neddaf> Can’t kill them cause you need to be alive to get a brojob
[2023-01-07 18:00:27] <Fenlast> @guccideltaco use oil and canon flames look at it burn to death

[2023-01-07 18:00:51] <%ErrSousa> So it's really though to get through the knights and just get 1 shot almost by the final boss. It's frustrating
[2023-01-07 18:01:24] <%Baryon23> maybe we do a poll? give up vs continue?

[2023-01-07 18:08:43] <pick240> twiggy and lucatiel are the summons somewhere if you were curious. if its possible.
[2023-01-07 18:08:45] <%+remiri> i think the best strat is to do what you were doing but defend the knight that is trying to seal a portal
[2023-01-07 18:08:47] <%Hornypotsmoker> 5Head strats tho

[2023-01-07 18:33:17] <%+remiri> i think they programmed it this way because they didnt attack you the knights couldnt seal the portals
