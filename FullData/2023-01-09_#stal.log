[2023-01-09 13:46:47] <kyrieepsilon> Anyone know when is 6.31 dropping? Just want to check whether we have time to grind out multiple BIS for static before TOP drop, we literally stop raiding after everyone get 1 BIS after 2 week lol
[2023-01-09 13:46:54] <+awayin_> So do raids in FF not have trash pulls or anything? Is it like straight to the boss?
[2023-01-09 13:47:16] <@%Jam_Dodger> @awayin_ thats right NODDERS

[2023-01-09 13:49:51] <@%Jam_Dodger> but i think they changed that now
[2023-01-09 13:50:28] <kyrieepsilon> @Jam_Dodger Anyway, I guess we will just grind out BIS for multiple role and job, who knows which job TOP would like...

[2023-01-09 13:51:44] <kyrieepsilon> Our ''big mega brain'' guy say she bet there will be multiple add phase, so maybe the balance will be a little bit screwy
