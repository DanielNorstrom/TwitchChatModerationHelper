[2023-01-11 00:56:09] <Cayenne_V12> @syzSmash you only get banned by vac if you run really old mid 2000s hack dll injectors tbh which he probably did
[2023-01-11 00:56:09] <+DumbWetDog> lmao kind of funny like -- okay yeah, once a cheater always a cheater, not necessarily true. people change. but once a cheater, nobody knows you, and now you win the kappa race??? cheater.

[2023-01-11 00:57:45] <%BadnBooty> I was in the shared banned list discord.  You can appeal the bans but for him to not get unbanned from any of the larger servers means there most likely was evidence beyond he was mean to a staff member.

[2023-01-11 08:06:50] <pugstaguy> Autism is a label that describes a large number of small or large conditions that lead to neurodivergent development. Theyr are all still so misunderstood that it is really hard to put all autistic people in one category because there are actually so many factors and the presentations of the condition. I personally know a good friend who is on the ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù but who is the most informed person I know about so many intellectual subjects. He is a cancer researcher by the way.
[2023-01-11 08:07:26] <iwalkwithwolves> the fact that you even aknowlege that you are still figuring things out is a good start
