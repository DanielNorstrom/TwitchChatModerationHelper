[2022-12-21 00:14:05] <SadLH> I used a 30 card frost DK to climb to legend.. but 2-3 days before the nerfs..
[2022-12-21 00:14:42] <SavageWolves> The latest balance changes netted a lot of dust… goodbye priestess and boon, it was fun while it lasted
[2022-12-21 00:15:13] <@%StarFox_SNES> Was anything worth disenchanting after the nerds though?

[2022-12-21 00:16:06] <SavageWolves> The general advice is to always disenchant the nerfed cards, and if they’re good again later, you can recreate them
[2022-12-21 00:16:15] <%rexmkh> pally doesn't have a lot of direct damage
[2022-12-21 00:16:24] <SadLH> I do not think we care about the board anymore

[2022-12-21 23:04:37] VIEWERS: 46
[2022-12-21 23:05:18] <hskookdoug> The idea is to get bolner, gorloc ravager, clownfish in your mulligan to draw a bunch of murlocs for free to effectively set up a rotgill play. you can usually get it rolling with the coin on turn 5 or 6 without it. schooling also enables rotgills DR easily. The combo is not the only win condition as murlocs were already effective in the past metas. you can use macaw W/ astalor for burst/ Mutanus for disruption and brukan's hero power
