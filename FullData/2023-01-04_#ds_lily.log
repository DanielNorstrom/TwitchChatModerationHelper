[2023-01-04 18:56:21] <%Svettgurkan> Heists are a single-player or multi-player mechanic introduced in the Heist league and can be performed using a Contract at The Rogue Harbour. The player must infiltrate the facility without raising alert, retrieve the guarded item, and escape with the contents alive. The target item will always be a single artifact that players may exchange with Faustus for Rogue's Markers therefore Heist Contracts are an excellent means to generate Rogue's Markers. Cheer50

[2023-01-04 19:47:33] <%Zoptar> there is a study about how many spiders we eat in our life per lifetime
[2023-01-04 19:47:34] <+turtleman8787> its like 4 a year
[2023-01-04 19:47:41] <%armadros> theres X spiders on the planet and Y space, therefore some number will go in your mouth

[2023-01-04 19:48:05] <RKN_Chris> speaking of spiders, I rehoused 3 of my tarantulas today. Always a fun experience :)
[2023-01-04 19:48:10] <%+toastylee123> Surely the odds of eating a bug in your sleep is 50/50 every night, either you do, or you dont
[2023-01-04 19:48:13] <%+zangarang> but is it more common to eat them on purpose or accident

[2023-01-04 19:54:28] <+devvinity> its not really a horror movie, its a suspense thriller, its good
