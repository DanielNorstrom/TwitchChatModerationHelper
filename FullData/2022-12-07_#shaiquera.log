[2022-12-07 13:09:43] <%+Kathom67> My, I finally found a way to make the Blunted Weapon Fitting again. The won't go on truncheons anymore for quite a while. But they work on bows, and so the blunted arrows are way more effective.

[2022-12-07 15:05:34] <TheCyberchill> At least in conan i can do the passes in admin mode
[2022-12-07 15:05:44] <%Lumivox> new battle pass... does it bring any new content?
[2022-12-07 15:05:44] <TheCyberchill> this would be a nightmare to do on offical pve/pvp
[2022-12-07 15:06:22] <Grandmastergamer1> do awesome now got 2 days off

[2022-12-07 15:10:19] <MonokonLIVE> Do you feel like the game is moving in the right direction?
[2022-12-07 15:10:20] <TheCyberchill> having the addtional layer of panic over my progress being completely and utterly lost my a pvp raider or a purge would instantly drain all intrest in these challenges  so im glad you can do it in solo mode with admin mode enabled but my friend said i'll be banned clearly thats cheating but I've not seen any statement from funcom that you cannot do these passes in singleplayer or a server you own. and how could they enforce that, also if i get banned for that well i'd never touch the game again.
[2022-12-07 15:11:15] VIEWERS: 502
[2022-12-07 15:11:41] <%$RioClete> single player you can do what you want. You'll be the only one there.
[2022-12-07 15:11:57] <%$RioClete> and a server you own, you set the rules.
[2022-12-07 15:12:06] <TheCyberchill> the battle pass is fine, especially if items from older passes will return to the bazzar, they just need to improve the bazzar tell players what is coming to the bazzar, and for what price, and stop the items discounted when they appear for sale for the first time, as that could get them into hot water in some european countires
[2022-12-07 15:12:30] <TheCyberchill> Yeah tell that to my friend Rio they gave me shit for doing it on my own time
[2022-12-07 15:12:44] <TheCyberchill> yeah i've got admin mode on
[2022-12-07 15:12:47] <TheCyberchill> it wasn't last season
[2022-12-07 15:13:08] <TheCyberchill> All i did was look at objectives, spawn in the npc or teleport to the npc, resoruce etc
[2022-12-07 15:13:10] <%+ever_theunicorn> You can complete the battle pass in admin mode
[2022-12-07 15:13:16] VIEWERS: 502
[2022-12-07 15:13:38] <%+ever_theunicorn> And they said specifically when the battle pass was introduced that it was perfectly fine to do that - so you will not be banned
[2022-12-07 15:13:56] <TheCyberchill> the issue is I dont find all my progress and ability to attemppt these challenges utterly removed from me by one script kiddie or just a tryhard on a pvp server or a purge on offical servers
[2022-12-07 15:14:26] <TheCyberchill> As soneone who is on a fixed income
[2022-12-07 15:15:05] <TheCyberchill> the ability to budget out what is available would be helpful, but it's also you know pro consumer no corpo does that stuff.

[2022-12-07 15:17:50] <TheCyberchill> similar but less of an issue with purge

[2022-12-07 15:19:20] <%+ever_theunicorn> They added that option for server owners to restrict raiding while offline - so just have to find the right server and you don't have to worry about offline raiding
[2022-12-07 15:19:33] <sabaraath72> ShaiQuera I don't seem to be able to find the server that u are on in the server list

[2022-12-07 15:19:59] <TheCyberchill> not really considering i'm offline whe  they do this my body inside my base or my clans base, I just wouldn't do this kinda stuff on pvp period at least not offical

[2022-12-07 15:21:59] <TheCyberchill> the dueling standard has also sorta made pvp mode kinda niche consider my friends and me could make a dueling arena

[2022-12-07 15:24:08] <Grandmastergamer1> O.O new battlepass stuff
[2022-12-07 15:24:21] <TheCyberchill> another good thing about the conan pass, the challenges give an exp boost per day but you can keep doing them if you have time
