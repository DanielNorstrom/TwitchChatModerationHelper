[2023-01-10 17:19:16] <+FunderWunk> @tallsonn which is the same thing. The card type in the gy is what matters
[2023-01-10 17:19:16] <%adamant0> With so many of your cards being shut down by graveyard hate are you worried about being able to win games where they keep your yard clear?
[2023-01-10 17:19:34] <Cablead> “Hexproof from X” as a lesser version of “Protection from X” is such good design

[2023-01-10 17:56:47] <rowrow_> your brews have kept me (and hundreds of others) coming back every weekday morning. The variety is off the charts, and makes modern really fun to watch and brew in
[2023-01-10 17:56:47] <Rasrr> do you ever miss pre modern horizon modern?
[2023-01-10 17:56:50] <%+red_kreppelin> maybe with flashback or something

[2023-01-10 18:00:01] <%+TurnPikeBear> I remember the creation of modern and as a big dumb dumb I was on the take that nobody would play it and standard would always be prominent. Soo that take went well
[2023-01-10 18:00:10] <%+codemasterz> my first deck was a golgari scavenge deck in rtr
[2023-01-10 18:00:14] <Vernash_> urza with opal + astrolabe was so insane

[2023-01-10 18:00:41] <philip619> my first set was gatecrash, that's what made me have an obsession for boros

[2023-01-10 18:31:05] <kamahl211> maybe chat thinks the conscription was attached to Herald because it tucks behind when exiled?
[2023-01-10 18:31:07] <+Coasterfreak99> He thinks it was still enchanted because of how the UI looks

[2023-01-10 20:09:41] <guffeisagod> @aspiringspike A fair max cube is a cube built to optimise the fair midrange magic experience. So no unfair decks supported. They also often include multiple fetches and duals, or can even have them in the land box. They often also go nonsingleton one some cards to better support things like stoneforge mystic or delver strategies
[2023-01-10 20:09:42] <@%redsevn> it's considerably worse now but it's still really good

[2023-01-10 20:35:35] <deeerell> better than our last deck

[2023-01-10 20:39:24] <+mattmanw2> Keeping gush in the sideboard so you don’t have to read the book before casting it is smart

[2023-01-10 20:56:11] <smore18> why does it feel like you'll draft the worst deck in cube, then go 3-0, but then get like Sol Ring, Mox/ other power, but then go like 1-2?

[2023-01-10 21:05:37] <@%phuckingmagikal> Spike, it's seemed like Breach GDS hasn't really taken off, and I haven't been able to yield the same results I had initially with the deck. :( I am looking to transition over to the Jeskai breach, but can't determine if the combo with station is better or just the murktideless breach deck is better.
