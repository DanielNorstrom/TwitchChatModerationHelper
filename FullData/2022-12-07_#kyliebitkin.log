[2022-12-07 17:46:43] <%SpectreUK> I think the main reason is because of the drifting parts being a huge bottleneck at the start
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%HotCocoaGamer> Drifting seems more of an event sort of deal nowadays tbh
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%kessy1893> everybody wantet a driftkit at the start but kinda nobody used them
[2022-12-07 17:47:20] <%TheOutlawBigBoss> You don't make money drifting, this city is very grind heavy. If it doesn't make money why do it. Which sucks.
