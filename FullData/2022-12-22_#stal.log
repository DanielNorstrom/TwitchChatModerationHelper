[2022-12-22 15:35:06] <%braum_oak> @kernymi I know about that '-' i play since 2018, but still sucks not having better alts/other jobs system to help you with different classes on ff. If you want to become max item level on a single character on FF it takes 8-12 weeks per job. And that is not good for someone that wants to play differents jobs.
