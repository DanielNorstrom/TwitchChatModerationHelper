[2022-12-19 16:17:59] <%Sotetsu> The USDA recommends leaving butter out at room temperature for only a day or two. But if it's stored in all of the proper conditions listed above, it can stay fresh for up to two weeks.
[2022-12-19 16:18:02] <!%AirahsELL> you get a butter bell. It's a little thing where you fill a basin with water and put butter in the top, it keeps the butter fresh with a water seal but you can store it at room temperature so it's always soft.

[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <+game_master_rukia> brand is key
[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <%StuckBoy> PC parts are notoriously divas
[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <Rolandkrain> yeah they die way faster than most other hardware too
[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <gambitmojo> @OliviaMonroe you can add many dives to your computer
[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <rempac15> LUL
[2022-12-19 16:45:20] <namons> SSHD probably
[2022-12-19 16:45:21] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> ssds dies too
[2022-12-19 16:45:23] <@%BlackCharcz> External harddrive or the one inside the PC?
[2022-12-19 16:45:23] <%ArcReaper_21> Great job!...unless it was your brothers found out you mean?
[2022-12-19 16:45:25] <spookgerook> Because they aren't Elves
[2022-12-19 16:45:29] <gambitmojo> ops drives
[2022-12-19 16:45:31] <%Paranormal_Instigator> SSD have a write limit
[2022-12-19 16:45:31] <!%AirahsELL> if its a heavy chonker that makes a whir noise when in use then it's an HDD.
[2022-12-19 16:45:34] <%+ParanoidCorgi> oh god a HDD and streaming olivia50Load
[2022-12-19 16:45:34] <!GoodishGames> Technology eventually dies
[2022-12-19 16:45:34] <%Sotetsu> SSD = super spiny disk
[2022-12-19 16:45:36] <$KingPlouton> cuz they're rotating rust with springs and electric motors. they wear out and die out
[2022-12-19 16:45:38] <!%Fuzzgotgames> How did you find this out
[2022-12-19 16:45:41] <%PigWithoutProtection> did you getvthe dreaded hard drive klicking?
[2022-12-19 16:45:42] <Temporal_Paradox> SSDs eventually die too
[2022-12-19 16:45:45] <+game_master_rukia> brand matters when it comes to hard drives
[2022-12-19 16:45:47] <%Nyandalos> Wearing out is inevitable for HDs and SSDs.
[2022-12-19 16:45:50] <!%AirahsELL> solid state drive is like a phone thing
[2022-12-19 16:45:50] <$itsev48> Yeah, Windows 10 have been tryna kill my disk hard drive for years.
[2022-12-19 16:45:51] <%$Dakmoonshadow> Rip hard drive kj2294HAHAHA
[2022-12-19 16:45:52] <gambitmojo> DONT press teh explode button
[2022-12-19 16:46:01] <@%BlackCharcz> also yes, they die a lot. specially after 2015 they are pretty much limited lifespan of 3 years

[2022-12-19 16:46:23] <$KingPlouton> ssds are chips. they have a very known amount they can be written to. it's easy to know when to replace them
[2022-12-19 16:46:28] <+game_master_rukia> i would say always go western digital

[2022-12-19 16:47:17] <!%AirahsELL> defragmenting will help a LOT.
[2022-12-19 16:47:28] <$KingPlouton> is it a seagate or western digital? :P

[2022-12-19 16:47:41] <@%BlackCharcz> the drive is afraid of the dark
[2022-12-19 16:47:44] <%Furudehan> defragmenting brings back memories.
[2022-12-19 16:47:44] <+oops_all_imaginary> hopefully not defragging an SSD
[2022-12-19 16:47:49] <%AlphaOmega82> you can check the SMART information to see if it has failed some checks
[2022-12-19 16:47:52] <jhonis624> Take your drive to see the spin doctor?

[2022-12-19 16:48:08] <%Furudehan> Wait you fell asleep while recording?
[2022-12-19 16:48:11] <%Sotetsu> I'm glad you were able to sleep.

[2022-12-19 16:48:47] <@%BlackCharcz> you just don't wnat to publis it
[2022-12-19 16:48:47] <!%AirahsELL> if your case has compartments for it, get some larger SSDs just to record to. Have your brothers help you install them and that should help some of your memory problems.

[2022-12-19 16:48:55] <%Leon27607> you need to invest in a SSD

[2022-12-19 16:49:14] <%VogonPoetry_42> oh sure

[2022-12-19 16:49:15] <$timochi24> Get a 2TB NVMe SSD
[2022-12-19 16:49:15] <%+JayBusch> Yes
[2022-12-19 16:49:15] <+game_master_rukia> yes for a couple hundered bucks
[2022-12-19 16:49:16] <Han_Mies> with money yes
[2022-12-19 16:49:21] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> SSD are smalls, but can have larger file sizes
[2022-12-19 16:49:21] <Redamaford> SSDs are going to be more expensive for the same amount of data space.
[2022-12-19 16:49:23] <%+JayBusch> You can get an 8TB SSD
[2022-12-19 16:49:24] <rempac15> how many terabytes you needs?
[2022-12-19 16:49:26] <%VogonPoetry_42> 2tb, 4tb, whichever
[2022-12-19 16:49:26] <@%BlackCharcz> there are SSDs up to 3TB, but they're not cheap and still last about 3-5 years only
[2022-12-19 16:49:26] <!%+FellyVT> How much space is your current SSD?
[2022-12-19 16:49:28] <%+ParanoidCorgi> yes and make that your boot drive and use the Spinny one for storage
[2022-12-19 16:49:28] <%Furudehan> Yes SSDs come in huge sizes now.
[2022-12-19 16:49:31] <!GoodishGames> SSD and an external hard drive
[2022-12-19 16:49:31] <Temporal_Paradox> if it's a desktop PC you can probably fit multiple. if room is limited there's always external drives for storage
[2022-12-19 16:49:32] <+BiztoneX> biggest you cab get is 2 tb
[2022-12-19 16:49:33] <leo_coelho> you can have two 500 GB SSD
[2022-12-19 16:49:38] <!%AirahsELL> the largest reasonably priced SSD is like 1 Terabyte. If your case isn't a micro pc you should have 2 or 3 slots for them.
[2022-12-19 16:49:42] <$KingPlouton> 8tb sata ssds
[2022-12-19 16:49:47] <!%AirahsELL> 1TB SSD costs like 100 bucks.
[2022-12-19 16:49:50] <+oops_all_imaginary> HDDs are cheaper than SSDs, SSDs are good for things you store less and access often
[2022-12-19 16:49:54] <sleepy_moohnie> for long lasting storage you're better of taking an HDD you can get like 8TB for fairly cheap
[2022-12-19 16:49:55] <%Sotetsu> Oli needs more computer closet space.
[2022-12-19 16:49:56] <leo_coelho> @KingPlouton aint those pricey?
[2022-12-19 16:49:56] <$nive_30si> "all the terabytes"
[2022-12-19 16:49:57] <+game_master_rukia> you can get an 8 tb but it isn't cheap
[2022-12-19 16:49:58] <%Jelo2299> you could set up your own storage server Kappa

[2022-12-19 16:50:06] <Redamaford> Hard drives are still going to be best for storing just raw data, like recording files.
[2022-12-19 16:50:10] <%+JayBusch> Oli, consider getting a NAS.
[2022-12-19 16:50:10] <!%+FellyVT> Just be glad its not 1TB in 2000, that would be more expensive.
[2022-12-19 16:50:10] <$StrikingWalrus> get a HDD for backup, get a SSD for playing games
[2022-12-19 16:50:15] <!%+FellyVT> @Dakmoonshadow Heyyyyy
[2022-12-19 16:50:16] <%+Dataskvid> Put new harddrives on throne
[2022-12-19 16:50:16] <$KingPlouton> about 100$ per tb at 8tb. if you need space it's great
[2022-12-19 16:50:17] <%AlphaOmega82> Oli Tech Tips
[2022-12-19 16:50:17] <%+ParanoidCorgi> you can get an external drive of 12gb to store
[2022-12-19 16:50:17] <!%AirahsELL> also the fact that some games can take like 200 gigs is ridiculous.
[2022-12-19 16:50:18] <%Leon27607> HDDS are better for pure "storage" but SSDs make stuff load faster(E.G. games that have a lot of loading times)
[2022-12-19 16:50:27] <%+ParanoidCorgi> 12tb*
[2022-12-19 16:50:31] <%RabidBeefalo> hdd is hard drive, cheaper and slower

[2022-12-19 16:51:08] <%Furudehan> Maybe you have an SSD and don't realize
[2022-12-19 16:51:11] <trublu1003> HD, SD, HDD, SSD, PSP, NRFB. The list goes on
[2022-12-19 16:51:12] <%+JayBusch> Hard Disk Drive = Spinning Platter, Solid State Drive = digital drive (no moving pieces)
[2022-12-19 16:51:17] <!%AirahsELL> okay. hard drive is HDD. it uses metal plates to store things. solid state drive is more like a memory card. HDDs can offer a ton more space but they fail more easily and are slower to load. SSDs load nearly instantly but costs MUCH more for the data.
[2022-12-19 16:51:21] <Redamaford> A standard hard drive has a PHYSICAL DISK in it, that spins.   An SSD has NO PHYSICAL DISK, the information is stored on an internal chip matrix.
[2022-12-19 16:51:22] <$timochi24> You could get like a 10TB HDD for the price of a 2TB SSD
[2022-12-19 16:51:24] <leo_coelho> SSD is very fast

[2022-12-19 16:51:43] <+game_master_rukia> for ssd get a samsung or sandisk
[2022-12-19 16:51:46] <%Jelo2299> Watch out for the best buy or micro center sales
[2022-12-19 16:51:47] <leo_coelho> by cheap you mean you aint made of money?
[2022-12-19 16:51:47] <trublu1003> Cheap is good, until it isn't
[2022-12-19 16:51:49] <Temporal_Paradox> hard drive is the old style with a physical spinning disk. they tend to hold more for less but is a little bit slower. good for video storage though
[2022-12-19 16:51:51] <fantasticbovine> you should ask someone qualified to install it, probably
[2022-12-19 16:51:52] <%Furudehan> Don't bother it sucks
[2022-12-19 16:51:52] <%Sotetsu> Put some on your Throne?
[2022-12-19 16:52:04] <@%BlackCharcz> SSD is good for games and maybe editing videos, for recordings you can work just fine with regular HDD, the linear speed is just fine for video recording
[2022-12-19 16:52:07] <%Sotetsu> Home Alone 4 is much better.
[2022-12-19 16:52:10] <!GoodishGames> You can easily store raw video footage on an external HDD, frees up space on your PC
[2022-12-19 16:52:12] <%+ParanoidCorgi> time to suggest some for throne

[2022-12-19 16:52:34] <!%AirahsELL> get a couple SSDs and ask your brothers to help put them in. Then use them to store the videos you're recording and editing.
[2022-12-19 16:52:35] <%Paranormal_Instigator> "I'm qualified" Oli says after having sprayed her computers internals with WD-40
[2022-12-19 16:52:36] <%Furudehan> They're pretty easy to install but you might need to get one of your brothers to do it.
[2022-12-19 16:52:37] <%ArcReaper_21> Umm. Maybe it might be a better idea to take it to Best Buy or your brothers...
[2022-12-19 16:52:39] <%+JayBusch> Oli, 8TB SSD is $600+, but it would be the easiest upgrade.
[2022-12-19 16:52:40] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Nothing gives me more anxiety than fixing my computer because it can go SO BADLY
[2022-12-19 16:52:41] <%Jelo2299> if qualified means jumping on the roof of the car then yes

[2022-12-19 16:52:52] <$KingPlouton> if i were you, and i had the money, i'd get a nas, it's an external box you put in 4-8 hdds. you can set it up as a redundant raid where if one or two drives fail it'll still work

[2022-12-19 16:54:11] <$timochi24> For example, current prices for HDDs are about $200 for 10TB. The largest SSD I could find was 8TB and that was over $600

[2022-12-19 16:54:45] <%+ParanoidCorgi> just get an external one and plug it in to USB
[2022-12-19 16:54:51] <%Melnazar> Remember, it's not the size of the hardrive that is important, it's how you use it
[2022-12-19 16:54:53] <+Qball_Gam1ng> The big question is "what is your budget?"
[2022-12-19 16:54:55] <$StrikingWalrus> will it last until then?
[2022-12-19 16:54:55] <%RabidBeefalo> a NAS is like a community of Sylvanian families, and if you lose some of the animals you can still play with the group Olivia :)

[2022-12-19 17:07:00] <!%AirahsELL> you're thinking of Franz Kafka

[2022-12-19 17:07:17] <%Furudehan> Kefka is the Joker of FF

[2022-12-19 17:07:27] <Redamaford> Correct developer, incorrect game.
[2022-12-19 17:07:27] <%Melnazar> Even though the name of Kefka was based on Kafka, hence the "Metamorphosis" theme song
[2022-12-19 17:07:27] <leo_coelho> Kefka, author of famous books
[2022-12-19 17:07:31] <%ArcReaper_21> Kafka is a main villain from FF6 (same level as Sephiroth from FF7)
[2022-12-19 17:07:31] <zeunknown> Kefka is the reason I'm attracted to clowns fr fr he's hot as heck
[2022-12-19 17:07:34] <Temporal_Paradox> one of the more memorable Final Fantasy villains
[2022-12-19 17:07:39] <@%BlackCharcz> It's Kefka and YES, the name was inspired by Kafka

[2022-12-19 17:12:58] <!%AirahsELL> There actually is, later on. Persona's artwork looks very much more anime. SMT looks like a young adult novel.
[2022-12-19 17:13:00] <%Furudehan> Persona has romance

[2022-12-19 17:14:03] <%Sotetsu> You've only gotten one character name.

[2022-12-19 19:25:29] <!%AirahsELL> my problem is that a lot of online interaction feels (and usually is) incredibly fake so I don't care about other people as individuals since I know for the most part the feeling is mutual. This is in real life too, you can't care about everyone that exists.

Hibbert is the good one but Nick is the "cheap" one who probably only got the universe's version of an online degree from WebMD.
