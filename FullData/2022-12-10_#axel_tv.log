То есть, проигрывая они не не проигрывают, типа у них есть шанс победить. Ну, точнее, не выиграть. Короче, почему они играют в покер: потому что они могут... ну, то, что они проигрывают...

[2022-12-10 19:26:43] <%bfcheg> isn't the point of dlss in playing on higher resolutions?
[2022-12-10 19:26:45] <%$lonesomekiller> xD
[2022-12-10 19:26:46] <NoomVNR> In the forest close to dorms, dlss give me 30 fps
[2022-12-10 19:26:52] <%$lonesomekiller> like a  white dog turd
[2022-12-10 19:27:05] <rgrbeattie> dlss is for low end pc's
[2022-12-10 19:27:13] <%$kiris95> you play on 1080p
[2022-12-10 19:27:22] <le_pipster> it should only give u aditional performance if the gpu was the bottleneck
[2022-12-10 19:27:23] <%$kiris95> so I'll never expect too much boost
[2022-12-10 19:27:49] <%$kiris95> but yeah, Tarkov is CPU intensive
[2022-12-10 19:27:56] <rgrbeattie> My 12900k works just fine Kreygasm
[2022-12-10 19:28:02] <%$kiris95> my poor 3700x knows that really well LUL

[2022-12-10 19:29:05] <+AsapKeat> I have a 3090 and I’m getting good frames in tarkov but I’m getting some stuttering I’m not sure how to fix. Rip
[2022-12-10 19:29:15] <TatanchoCL> on the crhistmas tree
[2022-12-10 19:29:28] <+AsapKeat> When ever I swing my aim around fast I feel like it happens
[2022-12-10 19:29:31] <le_pipster> tarkov uses huge amount of data. it likes low latency and high bandwith memory. hence why the 5800x3d is king
[2022-12-10 19:29:32] <andrewloots> Can i have a gamer kiss? it’s been a rough morning
[2022-12-10 19:29:40] <+jusz22> have u tried the nvidia dldsr on 4k with dlss on quality? @Axel_tv

[2022-12-10 19:48:57] <vincent_ger> @deltam4x I think of getting the cpu and dual channel 16gb ram with at least 3000mhz. That should to the trick
[2022-12-10 19:49:03] <%+deltam4x> @exoiwnl enough XD
[2022-12-10 19:49:22] <%+deltam4x> @vincent_ger you have a b350 or higher?

[2022-12-10 19:49:34] <+twistidmetal> lighthouse is very ran dependent
[2022-12-10 19:49:44] <exoiwnl> i have ordered the parts and im waiting for them to come so i can buy tarkov and play some :D
[2022-12-10 19:49:51] <dainsteel> i have 6800 rx and 5800x3d and i got factory 350 fps custom 150+
[2022-12-10 19:49:52] <TacoBlahBlah> I’m getting 140 on costumes with 3060ti with 5600
[2022-12-10 19:49:55] <%bigdmyfriend> should be
[2022-12-10 19:50:01] <TacoBlahBlah> On 1440
[2022-12-10 19:50:02] <vincent_ger> @deltam4x nah thats a problem too. I have a prime a320m-k. I have to upgeade bios firmware to be able to use the ryzenb 5 5600x and  i prolly wont get to use the full potential
[2022-12-10 19:50:02] <%HazardwasteQc> I have ryzen 3700X, 32gb 3600mhz ram and 3080. I get on average 90-100 fps on every map, 75-85 in lighthouse
[2022-12-10 19:50:25] <dainsteel> which one better
[2022-12-10 19:50:28] <exoiwnl> @dainsteel i would have gotten the X3d but its like 200$ more

[2022-12-10 19:50:42] <%HazardwasteQc> Burr is trying to get me to buy the 5800X 3d LUL wife is not to happy with Burr at the moment lol
[2022-12-10 19:50:55] <lordulstricat> @Axel_tv do you feel like technical skill is enough to dominate in Tarkov? Like you did last encounter, that looked like pure skill.  But most people say it's hard for skilled people to transition into being good at Tarkov.
[2022-12-10 19:50:59] <%+deltam4x> @vincent_ger i did that too, u get the full experience or at least 90% of it, but buy a better mainboard and your good
[2022-12-10 19:50:59] <%masonvalo> I still dont understand how my pc is running tarkov like its decend   2070 super i5-9600k  16gb ram   i dont understand, but im happy
[2022-12-10 19:50:59] <%$lonesomekiller> AMD is making a new 3dx as wekk
[2022-12-10 19:50:59] <+itsEzzyy> is that scope just preference? or is there a reason people are using it because it is worse than holosight
[2022-12-10 19:51:02] <%HazardwasteQc> 3700X
[2022-12-10 19:51:09] <%$lonesomekiller> well*
[2022-12-10 19:51:18] <%+deltam4x> @vincent_ger if you have enigh money, go for the 5800x3d not for the 5600x
[2022-12-10 19:51:39] <%+deltam4x> @vincent_ger and go for the highest possible ram speed u got
[2022-12-10 19:51:39] <dainsteel> i agree
[2022-12-10 19:51:45] <dainsteel> 5800x3d very good cpu

[2022-12-10 19:52:12] <vincent_ger> @deltam4x upgrading the cpu should give me 60fps+ on all maps right? because ill be upgrading step by step. Like every couple months
[2022-12-10 19:52:12] <+twistidmetal> just chill
[2022-12-10 19:52:14] <+twistidmetal> they usually outplay themselves

[2022-12-10 20:12:22] <HappyLittleDepression> @Bish_KeK cant do that anymore, they patched it. They wont push you anymore if you are inside crack house. Only birdeye will snipe you
[2022-12-10 20:12:30] <Bish_KeK> @HappyLittleDepression the best ways to attract them is run up to 2nd floor, and just sprint beside the glass in the lab bit, but be ready to laydown
[2022-12-10 20:12:31] <HappyLittleDepression> @Bish_KeK
[2022-12-10 20:12:35] <Bish_KeK> they will come to the outside though

[2022-12-10 20:13:33] <Bish_KeK> @HappyLittleDepression typically once i get them approaching crackhouse, they will be along the backwall, one sometimes hides near the lil temp building with the coat, and then another likes to sit by the green wall
[2022-12-10 20:14:09] <HappyLittleDepression> hmm ill try that next time
[2022-12-10 20:14:11] <Bish_KeK> i usually kill them by sitting in the room with the coat and duffle and watching for them to come pass
