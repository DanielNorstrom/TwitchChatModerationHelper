[2023-01-06 10:56:17] <IamMarkov> @creezyback silver stars - 3 wins,8goals,6assists
[2023-01-06 10:56:20] <IamMarkov> that's it
[2023-01-06 10:56:20] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> @creezyback the transfer market resetting every search is making me lose it
[2023-01-06 10:56:22] <%+Harwoodinho> 46 strength puts me off him unfortunately, cool card though
[2023-01-06 10:56:25] <uditthakur01> Hey stokes who to buy Ww varane or base lucio???
[2023-01-06 10:56:29] <@%$CreezyBACK> @aidan_acluvsufan_fan init lmao
[2023-01-06 10:56:30] <%DirTyD3NN> Yoyoyoyo
[2023-01-06 10:56:30] <%po_______> Zidane is a better benzema for me
[2023-01-06 10:56:44] <@%$CreezyBACK> @iammarkov does it expire at 6?
[2023-01-06 10:57:08] <+BigSaph> trivela best thing they added to fifa
[2023-01-06 10:57:08] <Aduriz666> they patched it without patch
[2023-01-06 10:57:10] <@%$CreezyBACK> They did a patch to stop a flair shot now it‚Äôs back
[2023-01-06 10:57:14] <%+thejasperb> so happy trivela got patched, people would only score green time long shots
[2023-01-06 10:57:26] <IamMarkov> @creezyback no it expires after 4 days I think
[2023-01-06 10:57:27] <%+whltemagnum> Do you feel sorry for the first opponent that you match? the poor guy is probably 0-0 hoping for a good weekend to be greeted by a top pro first game
[2023-01-06 10:57:27] <uditthakur01> Hey stokes who to buy Ww varane or base lucio???
[2023-01-06 10:57:27] <+putyz1> i have 95 Zizu,and he feels like a lengthy player as well
[2023-01-06 10:57:28] <maz162> zidane or jairzinho?

[2023-01-06 11:15:13] <mcdonaldsbigmac2023> Fair play to Haaland for all his goals but he has proven he is a fox in the box and nothing more. Nunez, while not doing as well, at least shows he can excel in all other areas of the field. he just needs to regain confidence to score

[2023-01-06 14:04:56] <%vegarking> Wow, I can't believe how much this stream has changed my life. Before I tuned in to watch Stokes play FIFA 23, I was just a lost soul, wandering through life with no purpose or direction. But as I watched Stokes effortlessly dominate on the virtual pitch, something inside me clicked. I realized that anything is possible if you set your mind to it and work hard. Stokes is truly an inspiration, and I am so grateful to have stumbled upon him.

[2023-01-06 14:10:50] <%sonyman123> Part 1: The Stokes & a girl: A Stokes one day spied a beautiful girl standing on a balcony along her friends. The girl seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Stokes's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at her. The girl stood very high, and the Stokes had to jump for her. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.
[2023-01-06 14:10:51] VIEWERS: 2¬†148
[2023-01-06 14:10:52] <%sonyman123> Part 2: Now he sat down and looked at the girl in disgust. "What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a girl that is not worth it."And off he walked very, very scornfully. Moral of the story: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.
