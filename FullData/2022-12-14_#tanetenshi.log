[2022-12-14 06:48:03] <%+waffleking1980> Here's a crazy thought. How about a horror game that involves actual giant spiders?
[2022-12-14 06:48:17] <%REAPER__MANIA> waffle just get metro exodus
[2022-12-14 06:48:23] <%ZillaOmega> @waffleking1980 that one would be Grounded
[2022-12-14 06:48:28] <%REAPER__MANIA> or grounded yea
[2022-12-14 06:48:30] <%ZillaOmega> yeah its Grounded sensei taneComfy
[2022-12-14 06:48:50] <%Syyrentis> fuck the paint? Lewd
[2022-12-14 06:48:58] <%ZillaOmega> rip paint
[2022-12-14 06:48:59] <%$cat_lionheart> But, red is your colour ane.
[2022-12-14 06:49:06] <%+waffleking1980> Grounded isn't a true "horror" game.
[2022-12-14 06:49:21] <@%+bigdaddyschkrimp> paint NTR doujin?
[2022-12-14 06:49:33] <%REAPER__MANIA> hence waffle metro Exodus. sure it's only a small part of the game but it's pretty terrorising
