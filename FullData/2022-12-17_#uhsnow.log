[2022-12-17 16:52:59] <%+CertainlyNotColby> I feel like you can play the game and not support Jk's opinions. She's getting bank eitherway from the game.
[2022-12-17 16:52:59] <NarcisDuran> who said that stuoid crap

[2022-12-17 16:54:26] <@%Vader> @uhSnow if you wanna play it, i would suggest doing a charity stream for trans rights or something. perfect way to support the game but also make JK mad ad also do some good
[2022-12-17 16:54:27] <@%^StreamElements> Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[2022-12-17 16:54:28] <%+KennyWolf> @lNSTlNCTT Whats the message?
[2022-12-17 16:54:41] <+Legendoftiny> @uhsnow I don’t think anyone who watches you regularly would think you anti trans or something like that but jk rowling doesn’t have anything to do with the game
[2022-12-17 16:54:53] <%StarAnjeLyn> @uhSnow pls read my last messages.
[2022-12-17 16:54:54] <@%Vader> i think as a content creator thats the safest and best way to do it
[2022-12-17 16:55:01] <%+daemonchill> people are hyppocrites... if people treated everything disney the same way they treat everything harry potter maybe i would feel different but walt disney was 100x worse than JK Rowling
[2022-12-17 16:55:05] <+DanLGG> Is that why the Harry potter guy said not to play that game?
[2022-12-17 16:55:06] <%StarAnjeLyn> *lowkey panicking*
[2022-12-17 16:55:13] <zedd486> it'll be a loud minority that does think that
[2022-12-17 16:55:18] <%+CertainlyNotColby> JK Didn't make the game, she just made the world. You can play it without supporting her imo. However,  I can see the position it puts you in as a CC. Since my opinion is that of anonymous person

[2022-12-17 16:56:59] <MadderHatter> jk betrayed her own writing and audience with that stance it's pretty horrible

[2022-12-17 16:57:15] <%slapperofbutts> or something on that line
[2022-12-17 16:57:16] <%+cuhlowee> @uhsnow that trans women are not women

[2022-12-17 16:57:25] <%StarAnjeLyn> She thinks that supporting trans women is a detriment to womens rights.
[2022-12-17 16:57:26] <+wordywords> People don’t think streamers who stream activision games are pro sexism

[2022-12-17 16:57:46] <%+cuhlowee> it's fucking ridiculous
[2022-12-17 16:57:50] <+scoped71> we dont
[2022-12-17 16:57:57] <%+StageName> yes
[2022-12-17 16:58:01] <MadderHatter> basically because shes a victim she doesnt want trans people using the womens bathroom is her stance
[2022-12-17 16:58:02] <%+cuhlowee> Yes.
[2022-12-17 16:58:02] <%+KennyWolf> Emma Watson also agrees with her stance too.
[2022-12-17 16:58:03] <%+XTraq_> I think boycotting the game for what JK said isn't right. The devs have worked hard on it and should be appreciated
[2022-12-17 16:58:03] <+Chaoski> She thinks since women create life that Trans women basically aren't women cause they can't create life
[2022-12-17 16:58:03] <%StarAnjeLyn> She says it detracts from the oppression that "real" women experience.
[2022-12-17 16:58:04] <Megadisaster24> It's worse than that, she made a whole book about someone being hated for being transphobic
[2022-12-17 16:58:09] <zedd486> which isnt surprising t
[2022-12-17 16:58:11] <%beakyreaps> politicians quote her too
[2022-12-17 16:58:12] <%iBeastVii> For somebody who made up this insane world of all diversity etc.. she is a big hypocrite
[2022-12-17 16:58:15] <eddymannn> she supports trans women who make the full change but she also belives women deserve a place too.
[2022-12-17 16:58:19] <educated_monkey> @KennyWolf what? no way
[2022-12-17 16:58:19] <MsLittleKitten> fuck her trans women are real women
[2022-12-17 16:58:20] <+TheEmmorf> Its one persons opinion anyway. Who cares.
[2022-12-17 16:58:21] <%+daemonchill> she's not an expert.. she's an author.. her opinion doesn't make a difference. why people give a shit about her is beyond me
[2022-12-17 16:58:21] <zedd486> yea its WILD

[2022-12-17 16:59:23] <Ludvigseen> just play the game LUL
[2022-12-17 16:59:25] <razuv> as a famous ice hockey player once said, it's just a game why you have to be mad?
[2022-12-17 16:59:26] <%+daemonchill> she has personal opinions.. she didnt put those opinions in her books.. THEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS... at least imho
[2022-12-17 16:59:26] <%+StageName> She made Dumbledore gay after all the books. I always thought that was a strange move since it wasnt in the story
[2022-12-17 16:59:29] <%+KennyWolf> I just hopes its a good game
[2022-12-17 16:59:30] <%+XTraq_> I don't think supporting the hard working devs for making a game should be related to what an out of touch woman said
[2022-12-17 16:59:30] <dylirious> she had zero involvement in the game, its not fair to the ppl who worked hard on it and genuinely love hp
[2022-12-17 16:59:30] <Megadisaster24> I still love it even though I detest her
[2022-12-17 16:59:32] <zedd486> liking the art is not the same as liking the author NODDERS
[2022-12-17 16:59:33] <@%^StreamElements> PLEASE DO NOT BACKSEAT COP/GAME! Snow is playing the game and he doesn't need your help! There is plenty of other things to talk about in chat :)
[2022-12-17 16:59:33] <+scaredsacrifice> i dont think your a bad guy for playing the game, a lot of good people worked on the game im sure
[2022-12-17 16:59:34] <%HeavyMetalKittenx> no it’s just a game. use Vader’s idea NODDERS
[2022-12-17 16:59:35] <Vilacc> Why do people give so much power to her or the mob that are out for blood
