[2023-01-03 12:48:08] <%cl0udbear> He's had a few rough deaths. A couple yesterday very sus while he was carrying stuff he wanted to extract. Pretty sure the last one was a stream snipe.

[2023-01-03 12:48:31] <%dekuw> yeah he seems anxious as
[2023-01-03 12:48:35] <%Bolf> He missing UK?
[2023-01-03 12:48:37] <nihtaat> he seemed to really enjoy Dark and Darker
[2023-01-03 12:48:40] <%+Hoogenboomer> Sac has been playing Trakov since its veeeery early days.. Think he's the first one I ever saw play  tarkov on stream
[2023-01-03 12:48:40] <+Thevhouse> hes always been like that imo
[2023-01-03 12:48:43] <%smokeygerald> I don\t think he ever got over his poo almost hitting his builders

[2023-01-03 12:49:22] <%cl0udbear> @Lemings Oh aye I forgot about moka pots. Friend of mine uses them and he spent a little while dialing his grind in to get the most out of it.

[2023-01-03 12:49:29] <%Lemings> DBauernf Yeah I've noticed that too Sadge I hope he can sort it out
[2023-01-03 12:49:32] <%Rastah_Mouse> Hes seems fairly straight forward with everything
[2023-01-03 12:49:32] <%smarti07> he seems hot having fun anymore. no matter the game (in my opinion). i stopped watching him because i feel on edge warching him
[2023-01-03 12:49:34] <%bills__________> pepeSpit cheaters
[2023-01-03 12:49:43] <%+3ammy> No cheaters in Wizardland

[2023-01-03 12:49:50] <%smokeygerald> don't put that on me
[2023-01-03 12:49:54] <%+Mackemm73> He seemed to have more fun playing with you and Smithy from what I have seen of his streams
[2023-01-03 12:49:54] <ChrisMFH> ummm integrity lol , he himself used macros ingame aka macriel
[2023-01-03 12:49:57] <%+CharonHendrix> It's just a tough to know in EFT if your death was legit or not

[2023-01-03 12:50:20] <%Lemings> airwolf_battenburg Sac is on the other side of the world, they want to play but the ping would be too much Sadge
[2023-01-03 12:50:33] <%Jarvisio> hayz reckoned he got cheeto'd this morning
[2023-01-03 12:50:34] <%+Dykey_VI> I don’t watch him too often but sometimes it seems like he misses playing with you smithy and UK streamers in general
[2023-01-03 12:50:40] <%Lemings> DBauernf Yeah, I'm a similar situation FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-03 12:50:41] <%Line_Noise> Tarkov needs a tactical replay like the DCS one
[2023-01-03 12:50:42] <%fredboi1> @BreaK did you see summit meet the silver surfer on factory ?
[2023-01-03 12:50:44] <%Ed_1878> I was looking at a site two days ago, after someone pointed it out and what $250 got you in cheats for this game , $275 with a hardware spoofer.  Some people have no life.
[2023-01-03 12:50:55] <%Rastah_Mouse> It makes me not wana play a raid if im honest
[2023-01-03 12:51:00] <%+Pielil> If Tarkov implemented a replay system it would honestly improve people's gameplay so much. You'd be able to identify cheaters 100% and be able to learn cheeky new spots. Win Win for all parties involved
[2023-01-03 12:51:00] <%+airwolf_battenburg> @Lemings Sadge, they were good days!
[2023-01-03 12:51:14] <%DanS0L0> same happened with shroud on pubg
[2023-01-03 12:51:15] <%cl0udbear> That traincart death was mad. I looked at that for like 20 minutes. Couldn't make any sense of it. Then I watched Veritas's audio video and I don't think the sounds we were hearing meant anything at all -_-
[2023-01-03 12:51:19] <%+Erikkir> well its mostly the loadingtimes for Sac, but the other stuff doesnt help
[2023-01-03 12:51:20] <%Oddstep> its the highlight of their lives to be on the stream, you see

[2023-01-03 12:52:04] <%thirty3baboons> replays downloadable after the raid timer ends.
[2023-01-03 12:52:04] <%+Deterginator107> Sequisha is getting some grim load times as well. the US servers seems to be getting it rough

[2023-01-03 12:52:19] <%Rastah_Mouse> If it didnt take so much time to load up and into a raid it wouldnt be as bad
[2023-01-03 12:52:19] <%MitosisDNB> tarkov don't even look into the sus mf's at the top of the flea. people selling 50-100 gpus just walk free and easy
[2023-01-03 12:52:20] <@%sRede> yeah, the game has so much server and client performance to spare, replays GOTEEEEMM
[2023-01-03 12:52:21] <CGcalvin> Honestly it's the loading times that have done it for me, uninstalled Tarkov for the first time in 4 years, also the loot is so inconsistent it feels like cheaters are looting through walls
[2023-01-03 12:52:22] <%Lemings> Being called out isn't even a risk for these people, because there is no replay system

[2023-01-03 12:53:16] <%+Erikkir> he sometimes "loads" for 30 sec just when unloading from a queue, it adds up to like 10 min often to get in, then he gets head/eyes right away

[2023-01-03 12:53:43] <+Thevhouse> why are scav queues so long tho...
[2023-01-03 12:53:46] <%fredboi1> The kill 3 pmcs quest isnt needed for kappa if your going for it i think
[2023-01-03 12:54:12] <%Jarvisio> When you've played the cycle and see what it could be like it makes it all the worse
[2023-01-03 12:54:17] <%kleier> 7
[2023-01-03 12:54:17] <%SeperateAdvance> 7 i think
[2023-01-03 12:54:26] <%fredboi1> need them for therapish
[2023-01-03 12:54:26] <%Rastah_Mouse> therapist? 8
[2023-01-03 12:54:27] <Blunt_Object> 8 it's for an engine
[2023-01-03 12:54:30] <%kleier> is it actually 7? i was memeing KEKW
[2023-01-03 12:54:30] <%fredboi1> its 8
[2023-01-03 12:54:39] <+Thevhouse> apparently squad scav queues are shorter than solo, which makes no sense to me at all
[2023-01-03 12:54:48] <%Lemings> It's kinda why I've been asking for PvE Tarkov, no cheaters, no metaslaves, no 3 hour queues, just enjoying the gunplay and trying new things peepoHappy
[2023-01-03 12:55:06] <%bigolslabomeat> you can cheat the scav queues: Invite a random and then immediately queue without waiting for them to accept. Puts you i the group queue as a solo and you get in way faster
[2023-01-03 12:55:10] <%+Erikkir> other games are like *30 sec map load, 30 sec matchmake (often a lobby/warmup)* then you're in, compared to Tarkov's 10 min to get in a match (for sac it seems)
[2023-01-03 12:55:14] <%$omgbob_> @Lemings sign me up...

[2023-01-03 12:55:42] <%MitosisDNB> i don't think many variety streamers are enjoying it. seq's doing 8-10 hours streams. signs of just going through the motions.
[2023-01-03 12:55:52] <%kleier> people expect a lot from netcode that introduces half a second latency when your ping is 25ms
[2023-01-03 12:55:59] <Nisco3000> @Erikkir And get killed under 10 seconds by a scav aimbot lol. Devs are trolling.
[2023-01-03 12:56:16] <+Chez92> @Lemings it's a grey area that I maybe shouldn't mention but it does exist. I'd love for them to do something single player, the gun play in Tarkov is second to none
[2023-01-03 12:56:24] <%fullerben88> break is broke
[2023-01-03 12:56:24] <%+Pielil> They already have a replay system in place though to be able to watch back raids for suspected cheaters. Might be a bit 2Head zero IT exp of me here but why can't they just make some changes and make it so they can send out raid replays to everyone once the raid ended?
[2023-01-03 12:56:44] <Nisco3000> Queue times annoying for people that can only play 4 hours a day.

[2023-01-03 13:04:20] <%Lemings> I've been thinking of getting open back headphones but there's just too much noise around me
[2023-01-03 13:04:24] <%Rastah_Mouse> hlo
[2023-01-03 13:04:27] <%BazHicks> @BazHicks best thing ive ever used tbh!
[2023-01-03 13:04:33] <+Nate_Hatred> I loved my Beyer but honestly the padding and such wasn't that good for a 130 euros headphone..
[2023-01-03 13:04:35] <%Spokee01> Only thing putting me off is that they don’t have a mic
[2023-01-03 13:04:52] <%LiamG> yeh, calling it a headset is misleading
[2023-01-03 13:04:57] <%LiamG> it's just headphones right?
[2023-01-03 13:04:57] <%Eddamantium> @Spokee01 stick a modmic on it
[2023-01-03 13:05:02] <+itsTatakae> happy new year mate
[2023-01-03 13:05:02] <%fofo8383> @Nate_Hatred new versions have replaceable headband padding
[2023-01-03 13:05:02] <%j5f8k23> Your room is good.
[2023-01-03 13:05:08] <%LiamG> proper studio headphones
[2023-01-03 13:05:22] <+Chez92> I use sony wh-1000xm3s, I doubt they're the best quality because they're wireless and noise cancelling but I couldn't live without them
[2023-01-03 13:05:22] <%Lemings> I got an Elgato Wave 1 from Amazon when it was on sale last year, it's quite nice
[2023-01-03 13:05:25] <%MedkitMedkit> @BreaK I take your opinion on headphones more seriously, as your not "sponsored" by them.
[2023-01-03 13:05:26] <+Nate_Hatred> @fofo8383 yeah mine does too but the padding on the ears.. man, those fell apart in less than 2 years of intense use, and I wasn't pleased.
[2023-01-03 13:05:30] <%BazHicks> @Nate_Hatred Oh i love the padded padding on them
[2023-01-03 13:05:31] <%Spokee01> I can’t use one too easy, I have my work laptop and my desktop, and cba unplugging and plugging it in

[2023-01-03 13:05:57] <%SeperateAdvance> I have the same headphones - use them for gaming and listening to music - best pair i have owned ever
[2023-01-03 13:05:58] <%+Baz_RH> open back is the way
[2023-01-03 13:06:03] <BerserkeRFPS> makes the sound more natural too
[2023-01-03 13:06:06] <snurre> AKG K702 for me
[2023-01-03 13:06:07] <%Spokee01> What’s a modmic @eddamantium !?
[2023-01-03 13:06:09] <%Eddamantium> I remember having trouble getting a decent enough volume out of them, do you have a big mixer?
[2023-01-03 13:06:13] <+Octanexx> its called a wide soundstage
[2023-01-03 13:06:14] <%uni1> open back > closed
[2023-01-03 13:06:15] <%MitosisDNB> i've got dt880's. they are semi-open
[2023-01-03 13:06:24] <Flapjackzack> the soundstage is wider
[2023-01-03 13:06:24] <Nisco3000> close back the sound goes inside my ears Kappa
[2023-01-03 13:06:24] <%+3ammy> Wait til you have a 7yr old.......you'll soon want those headphones to close off everything
[2023-01-03 13:06:24] <%uni1> Closed sounds rubbish, all muffled
[2023-01-03 13:06:26] <%BazHicks> I think all headphone padding wears out in 2yrs with heavy use, Bose and Sennheiser both wore out in 2-3yrs for me
[2023-01-03 13:06:29] <%Eddamantium> @Spokee01 look up Antlion Modmic
[2023-01-03 13:06:30] <%fofo8383> @Nate_Hatred they are great value and 23€ for replacement pads is good
[2023-01-03 13:06:44] <%+SmudgyStatistic> it further up near ZB-16

[2023-01-03 13:07:12] <+Octanexx> Ive had this pair of Senns HD650s for like 9 years, every day use, amazing for gaming
[2023-01-03 13:07:16] <%BazHicks> @Nate_Hatred I agree $130 for the headphones is very cheap for what they are, and replacements being around 20euros every 2 yrs for the padding is very reasonable
[2023-01-03 13:07:27] <%WaveyDL> Sup @BreaK & chat!
[2023-01-03 13:07:27] <%Lemings> Took me about 2 years for the pads on my Corsair Virtuoso. Luckily I could get replacements on AliExpress for cheap
[2023-01-03 13:07:28] <%MedkitMedkit> I am still using 4yrs used amazon bin special Corsair void pro - wireless and they are comfy for my big ed.

[2023-01-03 13:07:57] <+Nate_Hatred> @BazHicks it's okay to spend that if you use them every day but tbh, since I switched to a good pair of in-ears I have no desire to go back

[2023-01-03 13:18:00] <mastermindxlk> Thats how I feel about cheaters. Ive thought about it so much almost every death I have I think its a cheater. Its really messed up my thought process on a good fight. I have had really good fights but when I get insta tapped its hard to not assume the worse.

[2023-01-03 13:26:28] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> I think one of the biggest issues is lack of FPS games where people like yourself can excel, without the new games its hard to show your skills @BreaK

[2023-01-03 13:31:55] <%+Babylon> @BreaK but forreal, have your management contact twitter support and have them send in your pubg championship and other esport articles when you played with TSM. the break handle is currently suspended. that should be a quick 24 hr turnaround for you to get it.
[2023-01-03 13:31:58] <%r31d4n> Erikkir that's just your account name
[2023-01-03 13:32:02] <%+Erikkir> also what is the difference with normal version trader standing vs "good" standing?
[2023-01-03 13:32:20] <%+Erikkir> @r31d4n so if you dont have it? you get a random name?
[2023-01-03 13:32:23] <+Grarc_og> @bazhicks That’s daft. It can be set up in advance and goes live Jan 1

[2023-01-03 13:37:03] <%+Babylon> @Grarc_og Bro you're pretty offbase and honestly just being a bit of a twat. Discussing the reality of viewership is not the same as complaining.

[2023-01-03 13:37:27] <%BazHicks> the numbers were lower due to trying new things and doing variety, was always going to differ. nnout to do with TSM
[2023-01-03 13:37:34] <+Agitated_Snail> Wouldn't agree with that Break but I just think you talk about the numbers openly

[2023-01-03 15:56:11] <%+Richeh79> Yeh the fps is pretty bad on Witcher 3 after the “next gen” update
[2023-01-03 15:56:23] <%+Monsieur_Toad> Not only are the issues frustrating, but they're also adding stuff that's quite annoying (like broken wall debuff, I'm currently near -10% XP and +15% fuel)

[2023-01-03 17:15:36] <%+5teepy> Don't think of it as frying but cooking with hot asir @BreaK
[2023-01-03 17:15:36] <%Tydell> air fryer is just a regular oven with air circulation.

[2023-01-03 17:15:43] <+AsBeane> its just a small convection oven so anything you stick in the oven you can put in the airfrier

[2023-01-03 17:15:56] <%+Richeh79> If it’s a cost saving thing then a slow cooker is way cheaper to use
[2023-01-03 17:15:56] <%Cartster> @BreaK It has 4 settings... Air Fry, Grill, Roast Bake
[2023-01-03 17:15:59] <Buttzyy> hence the AIR

[2023-01-03 17:16:19] <+CzubaDK> much lower energy use
[2023-01-03 17:16:23] <+ibazil> cheaper to run than an oven due to the smaller volume

[2023-01-03 17:16:28] <+Ted_Danger> air fryers are convecton ovens technically
[2023-01-03 17:16:28] <%+TheRealMichaels> it uses like 10% of the electric of the oven

[2023-01-03 17:51:09] <+Nate_Hatred> basically yes ^

[2023-01-03 17:51:17] <%+madziix> you have the bike already?
[2023-01-03 17:51:25] <%LoeVG> THere is a trials bike with a clutch @BreaK
[2023-01-03 17:51:26] <+drpepperenjoya> its possible
[2023-01-03 17:51:27] <+Vessec> Just a kill switch to cut off the motor
[2023-01-03 17:51:33] <+AsBeane> it wouldn't be a clutch right, just a cut off
[2023-01-03 17:51:34] <Solf1re> emergency stop ripcord like you get on a treadmill
[2023-01-03 17:51:36] <cirocbottle101> I mean it doesn’t have to be a clutch, just a switch to shut the bike off
[2023-01-03 17:51:39] <%fredboi1> Whiskey dick is a sad thing Sadge
[2023-01-03 17:51:40] <+OozyFuzzyWuzzy> It would just be a damper on the throttle, not an actual clutch.
[2023-01-03 17:51:59] <%Line_Noise> Some early motorcycles had throttles that operated the other way around and there’s been real talk of them coming back for electrics
[2023-01-03 17:51:59] <+drpepperenjoya> the e-stop is kinda good, but you need a free wheel really because otherwise the motor will spin you off
[2023-01-03 17:52:02] <%Bolf> clutch , nah , a switch is easy , no power on a motor is same as a clutch in
[2023-01-03 17:52:08] <+drpepperenjoya> yeah jetski kill switch
[2023-01-03 17:52:08] <cirocbottle101> A kill switch in the shape of a clutch lever, same diff
[2023-01-03 17:52:10] <+TheOldStagGamer> dead mans switch
[2023-01-03 17:52:11] <%+dash_dingo_> yeah dead mans handle type deal
[2023-01-03 17:52:11] <+Ted_Danger> kill handle
[2023-01-03 17:52:18] <%+Cut_n_Run> kill switch will just be a wrist band yeah
[2023-01-03 17:52:21] <shimmerghost> put a dead switch like on motorboats
[2023-01-03 17:52:28] <%+5teepy> Or a grip safety like a gun has? let gp of the handlebar and the engine cuts out
[2023-01-03 17:52:28] <%+a2allen> I still can't believe ken block. man that sucks.
[2023-01-03 17:52:39] <%Bolf> not if the kill switch is the clutch lever area lol

[2023-01-03 17:53:18] <+Nate_Hatred> @DaveNF jokes aside, whiskey throttle is not being in control of your right wrist when you accelerate, the power of the bike will push you back and you'll end up opening the throttle more, people panic when that happens but they struggle to have a smooth acceleration
[2023-01-03 17:53:27] <%pisketti> what if you could control some sort of switch by clenching your cheeks Hmm
[2023-01-03 17:53:53] <+drpepperenjoya> @Nate_Hatred a form of hysterisis

I owned a cayman, a 996 911 and through that got to drive a 997 C4S and a 991 - they are such massively competent cars now.
