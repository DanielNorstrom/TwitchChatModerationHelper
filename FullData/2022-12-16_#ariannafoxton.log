[2022-12-16 21:22:05] <TheKzak> Derived from math, but statistics are notorious for being inaccurate.
[2022-12-16 21:22:08] <@%Gibster99> It depends on the extra words
[2022-12-16 21:22:15] <@%Gibster99> If it's just statistics maybe just science

[2022-12-16 21:45:39] <%$british_nep> i was so sad
[2022-12-16 21:45:39] <%LMAO_YEET_> Fishing is calming
[2022-12-16 21:45:44] <@%Wloos> it's just chilling with ur thoughts
[2022-12-16 21:45:53] <@%Wloos> nature is nice
[2022-12-16 21:46:09] <Wipitricks> I saw the appeal of it, but then it changed when the fish was out and they wanted to kill it <.< (I didn't think that far lol)
[2022-12-16 21:46:10] <@%Wloos> fishing nature is very mid
[2022-12-16 21:46:28] <Wipitricks> ironically in FF14 Fisher is my highest level class
[2022-12-16 21:46:33] <%SetPhaserstoPun> yeah i wasnt a fan of the "oh wait this fish is like on a hook and still alive"
[2022-12-16 21:47:23] <Wipitricks> ooh it's the opposite here o.0
[2022-12-16 21:47:33] <@%Gibster99> I caught a glimpse into sport fishing seeing a video of sport fishing cheaters putting weights in their fish

[2022-12-16 21:48:41] <Wipitricks> DAMN, bizarre
[2022-12-16 21:48:56] <%$british_nep> you need a license for fishing in the uk
[2022-12-16 21:49:00] <TheKzak> In Rimworld, that's a way to boost Medical skill for novice doctors.
[2022-12-16 21:49:18] <Wipitricks> I think you need a license here too, and you gotta do it for sport in most places x.x
[2022-12-16 21:49:24] <@%Wloos> ye one time my dad had to basically rip the hook out and kill the fish since it was stuck
[2022-12-16 21:49:29] <Wipitricks> @TheKzak for real?!
[2022-12-16 21:49:32] <%$british_nep> i never paid for a license and i just go fishing in the sea
