[2023-01-03 00:00:27] <fokeriser> this deck vs dk KEKWait
[2023-01-03 00:00:27] <@^Nightbot> Check out latest YouTube video: Best Of Wild Hearthstone 2022 - https://youtu.be/ZcCQwDDib6A
[2023-01-03 00:00:46] <+Tothmatthewmate> this deck seems too weak for me
[2023-01-03 00:00:57] <boogeymonsta> I tried doing it with concoctions and had an awful time
[2023-01-03 00:01:15] <boogeymonsta> Full combo ends it on 7
[2023-01-03 00:01:26] <boogeymonsta> Im off for the night, have a good one!
[2023-01-03 00:01:32] <boogeymonsta> Good night all!

[2023-01-03 00:05:25] <doingtheobvious> Think any nerf reverts will happen with the rotation? Or that they'll fucking finally do something about Guff once he rotates?
[2023-01-03 00:05:32] <%lmikel1337> @danehearth thoughts on double battlecry in this deck?

[2023-01-03 00:08:02] <doingtheobvious> Hope springs eternal they'll realize that Guff was a horrible mistake to print. But hope also rides alone, so.
[2023-01-03 00:08:09] <birthdeformities_> wait, why did you concede?

[2023-01-03 00:08:15] <+PatMatRed1> isn't ghostly strike any good?
[2023-01-03 00:08:38] <iLoveLamp007> so many even shaman bots, report everyone even if it's a real person.
[2023-01-03 00:08:40] <i_roxas_> @birthdeformities_  they had lethal
[2023-01-03 00:08:42] <doingtheobvious> Ghostly Strike is pretty good. Like a slightly better Shiv imo.

[2023-01-03 01:49:38] <enlace24> it gives +2 spell damage
[2023-01-03 01:49:50] <Riathy> how would you have gotten the extra spell dmg then? Because you got a 3/2. shadowstepping it to deal extra dmg would've killed it

[2023-01-03 01:50:41] <boogeymonsta> +2 spell damage +2 +1 spell bois make it 36 dmg or +2 spell damage plus 2 garrote and shadow of demise garrote for 36 as well
