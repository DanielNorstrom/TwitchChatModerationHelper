[2022-12-25 16:57:05] <$Thalmize> i would like to take time to blame waffle, for getting me addicted to this modpack.
[2022-12-25 16:58:19] <MAADSolar> thank you for your honesty and openness
[2022-12-25 16:58:35] <MAADSolar> we don't judge here
[2022-12-25 16:58:45] <$Thalmize> peepoShy
[2022-12-25 16:59:11] <satyasann> hey bois, new to modded minecraft, what modpack should i start with that's kinda similar to this pack waffles playing? it seems fun
[2022-12-25 16:59:16] <%dennixfailalot> but there are no time refunds
[2022-12-25 16:59:25] <$Thalmize> KEKW
[2022-12-25 17:00:10] <$Thalmize> ill probably do two runs one reg, and the next one sky world
[2022-12-25 17:00:43] <MAADSolar> @satyasann I'm also wondering the same thing. Looking for a tech pack
[2022-12-25 17:01:31] <%0omkins> Omnifactory would be a good first step
[2022-12-25 17:01:40] <%0omkins> there really isn't anything like Nomi/GregTech
[2022-12-25 17:01:40] <@%^Moobot> You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2022-12-25 17:01:50] <%0omkins> Omnifactory if you want something very similar to this
[2022-12-25 17:02:01] <satyasann> is it also like quest based like nomi?
[2022-12-25 17:02:16] <%0omkins> I believe so
[2022-12-25 17:02:33] <satyasann> aight imma try starting with that. thanks!
[2022-12-25 17:02:39] <%0omkins> alot (almost all of the most popular  modpacks) have a quest based progression system
[2022-12-25 17:02:50] <MAADSolar> nice
[2022-12-25 17:03:01] <%0omkins> just to keep you on a rough track through the technology teirs
[2022-12-25 17:04:29] <$Thalmize> if this didnt have a quest pack, i would be lost as fuck
[2022-12-25 17:06:10] <satyasann> also is omni recommended to be hosted on a server? for like overnight resource generation? i can't really keep my pc running 24/7 lol
[2022-12-25 17:08:29] <%0omkins> for the price I'd host it honestly.
[2022-12-25 17:08:40] <%0omkins> I mean are you going to coop it with buddies?
[2022-12-25 17:08:44] <%0omkins> or just solo it?
[2022-12-25 17:10:11] <$Thalmize> anyone know how to get the pulsing iron in this pack?
[2022-12-25 17:10:12] <@%^Moobot> Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2022-12-25 17:11:36] <satyasann> @0omkins probably solo
[2022-12-25 17:12:00] <%0omkins> For me the offline generation of stuff is nice but not essential
[2022-12-25 17:12:12] <%0omkins> so save a few bucks
[2022-12-25 17:12:33] <%0omkins> Then again if you've got 15$/month to spare
[2022-12-25 17:12:39] <%0omkins> hosing your own server is ncie
[2022-12-25 17:12:41] <%0omkins> *nice
[2022-12-25 17:12:50] <$Thalmize> plus you an always just ramp up and get more production if you want it quicker
[2022-12-25 17:13:06] <%0omkins> Yeah offline generating things is cheating
[2022-12-25 17:13:09] <%0omkins> :D
[2022-12-25 17:13:27] <$Thalmize> im doing this pack solo and not hosted @satyasann

[2022-12-25 19:33:07] <CultOfNeurisis> light behaves as both particle and wave. the answer is not absolute, it's "it depends and contextual" which was what threw scientists for a loop, because we presupposed all knowledge is absolute not contextual.

[2022-12-25 19:36:39] <CultOfNeurisis> @frainsbreeze in relativity, the speed of light being constant in all reference frames is axiomatic. has nothing to do with what has been measured or not, if we >do< measure something that breaks this, we would break relativity. which is fine, but it's currently axiomatic

[2022-12-25 20:58:18] <veloxmors> every tab is treated like a unique browser, but garbage collection is based on the browser

[2022-12-25 20:58:24] <awesomefreak72> its for fast opening of closed tabs
[2022-12-25 20:58:25] <rinrn> @Giantwaffle, unused memory is wasted memory. If windows call for more memory webbrowser be it chrome or firefox will free some memory.
[2022-12-25 20:58:25] <Boisss> You can disable the refresh on background thing in chrome to save up some memory
[2022-12-25 20:58:27] <+WDForty> close all of crome, then do the "open last cosed" on the group
[2022-12-25 20:58:28] <%LUCIFER_RA> yea i use opera gx as well

[2022-12-25 20:58:36] <+Akunin_EQ> I think all browser tabs are instanced to protect from other tabs, no shared components = more memory usage
[2022-12-25 20:58:39] <%WalrusPug> @Giantwaffle hit F12 and check the "Application" tab to see all the caches and service workers and coockies and and and
[2022-12-25 20:58:46] <+AJ_Tupman> @0066 Edge is pretty good.

[2022-12-25 20:58:59] <Trollsamaa> @AJ_Tupman Edge is built off chromium. it basically doesn't matter what you use as a browser, basically all of them are chromium
[2022-12-25 20:59:02] <NicelysBabyGirl> watch open a tab look at the chrome in task manager close tag it says the same
[2022-12-25 20:59:07] <+IlsaGold> @AJ_Tupman Edge is chrome

It is known for its strength, durability, and versatility, which makes it useful in a wide range of applications. Nylon is a polyamide, which means it is a polymer composed of repeating units of amide groups."

[2022-12-25 21:53:18] <+Ohmec> @Giantwaffle LastPass does not keep your passwords. It's all stored locally

[2022-12-25 21:53:19] <+AyayaPRlME> you should

[2022-12-25 21:53:21] <HostileLogOut> just dont use a password manager at all.
[2022-12-25 21:53:22] <%imTymp> i use a different password for everything important

[2022-12-25 21:53:32] <@%+Nexhunter> OMEGALUL thinking lastpass is local only
[2022-12-25 21:53:34] <Maximus439> i just autogen passwords and use a local password manager
[2022-12-25 21:53:35] <SimonSez> I use selfhosted Vaultwarden
[2022-12-25 21:53:39] <HostileLogOut> 2FA i use for everything.

[2022-12-25 21:53:44] <+Jeramu> @Ohmec They keep the encrypted values. The encryption key is stored locally on your machine
[2022-12-25 21:53:44] <dollar_cave> as long as your master password is good, the password vault can't be decrypted
[2022-12-25 21:53:44] <MrWaka27> Remember to enable Authenticators guys.
[2022-12-25 21:53:44] <elkarr> yeah If possible use 2FA
[2022-12-25 21:53:49] <itzSimondr98> My password is 13 random letters KEKW
[2022-12-25 21:53:50] <%CJS7070> having different passwords for everything and having the encrypted passwords leaked is STILL BETTER than using one password for everything and having IT get leaked

[2022-12-25 21:53:59] <Flamewolf13> last pass has a different way of securing it, so there would still be an insane brute force to try and guess your master password in order for them to try and get your other passwords

[2022-12-25 21:55:14] <%+dav3yb> I've been using Bitwarden recently, also deleted my lasspass account recently due to their data breach
[2022-12-25 21:55:15] <Harmar> depends on the safe, there is alot of fake and cheap ones
[2022-12-25 21:55:18] <Yakobro> @TheWonderLlama you still want to minimise inport/export busses, to lower lag
[2022-12-25 21:55:19] <SilverSnowFFXIV> They are rated in time.
[2022-12-25 21:55:21] <elkarr> here its usually rated for 3 hours fire
[2022-12-25 21:55:21] <%Smithii> They prevent fire, not melting
[2022-12-25 21:55:28] <+AnesthesiaFC> fireproof safes, keep the fire INSIDE the safe

[2022-12-25 21:55:37] <%imTymp> yea i have a biometric gun case too
[2022-12-25 21:55:37] <+CarlysleGaming> a safes fir rating will tell you at what temp and how long at that temp it will work.

[2022-12-25 21:56:05] <HostileLogOut> put a fire proof safe inside a nuclear proof safe inside a electromatic proof safe.. inside a safe.
[2022-12-25 21:56:07] <@%+Nexhunter> LPL gonna need to do fire rating testing KEKW
[2022-12-25 21:56:14] <+CarlysleGaming> LPL is a sham lol
[2022-12-25 21:56:15] <%imTymp> locks prevent honest people not criminals remember that
[2022-12-25 21:56:19] <Harmar> @GuardMoony pepeLaugh so many "perfect" items... opened with a paperclip or a magnet
[2022-12-25 21:56:19] <+AnesthesiaFC> safes are rated on how long it takes to open them, no safe is completely unbreakable
[2022-12-25 21:56:21] <%+memothegreat> it s a fluke
[2022-12-25 21:56:21] <elkarr> sometimes picking the lock takes less than using the key lol
[2022-12-25 21:56:27] <SimonSez> All locks are bad. It's just a deterrent
[2022-12-25 21:56:27] <%LUCIFER_RA> luckily i am poor enough to not care about things getting stolen

[2022-12-25 21:56:36] <Necto_gck> he opens locks with coke cans
[2022-12-25 21:56:38] <Trollsamaa> if a LPL video is more than 30 seconds long, thats basically an endorsement
[2022-12-25 21:56:39] <GuardMoony> or just screw on the hinges you can undo
[2022-12-25 21:56:40] <%+memothegreat> locks keeps friends away
[2022-12-25 21:56:42] <@%Larklen> @natsu130 scissors can fix that
[2022-12-25 21:56:48] <Typicalbox> as someone who can pick locks, LPL is 100% real.
[2022-12-25 21:56:55] <+Eriberry> lock picking lawyer opening motorcycle locks is oof, but a lot of motorbike locks really just buy you time and deter but ppl still will get through a lock if they want it bad enough
[2022-12-25 21:56:56] <+Techniker32> Bulletproof glass it is then
[2022-12-25 21:56:58] <Kadotettu_> Locks keep honest people honest
[2022-12-25 21:57:03] <CurbSerpent> Locks stop crimes of opportunity.
[2022-12-25 21:57:05] <Harmar> most it will do is take 5 minutes of a very annoyed thief to break into anything physical

[2022-12-25 21:58:00] <holdfastt117> walmart had a study done, that they spent more money employing security than merchendise was stolen. so alot of there stores are going security-less
