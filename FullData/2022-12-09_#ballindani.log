[2022-12-09 04:10:32] <+TiggerTime666> the mistake with the current doom changes is that they all landed at once. if OW2 made balancing changes more often then every 3 months then it might not be so crazy if he had 1 of those buffs coming out on a biweekly schedule to see how he felt after each one.
