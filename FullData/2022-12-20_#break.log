[2022-12-20 10:52:01] <%ManSolo> No the original reason for advising against drinking on antibiotics was because one of the 1st uses of antibiotics was to treat syphilis. So the advice to not drink was to stop people spreading it while the antibiotic was still fighting of the syphilis as the person is still contagious. @BreaK

[2022-12-20 11:09:56] <%kleier> that's coz it's too similar to tarkov init
[2022-12-20 11:09:59] <%fofo8383> Sadge
[2022-12-20 11:09:59] <%GamerGirl07TV> If anyone here can make a game: Make escape from tarkov, but in Birmingham Prayge (and make sure the guns are from modern era)
[2022-12-20 11:10:05] <%fofo8383> react Andy day

[2022-12-20 11:10:09] <Richie364> @Funk_Diggiddy idk, a lot of big streamers played it from Tarkov etc - but the game is much shitter than Dark and Darker imo they have been adding content
[2022-12-20 11:10:20] <%smokeygerald> events on eft thou
[2022-12-20 11:10:22] <%fofo8383> and also Reacting
[2022-12-20 11:10:31] <%kleier> yeah people are playing other games but they don't want to feel burned out by playing a game that's basically identical
[2022-12-20 11:10:35] <@%sRede> is tarkov getting anything new the next wipe?
[2022-12-20 11:10:36] <lRutger> You should try League of Legends or Minecraft POGU
[2022-12-20 11:10:37] <%+Mr_Wilsonn> before we start, can we check dayz too.. not to delay anything at all
[2022-12-20 11:10:43] <%smokeygerald> streets in next wipe?
[2022-12-20 11:10:45] <@%Breakspear> Tarkov's wipe will be: New Weapons, same quests, players bored after 3 weeks
[2022-12-20 11:10:45] <%GamerGirl07TV> Tarkov is getting a new map, so yeah it's hype
[2022-12-20 11:10:50] <%+NotTheRealJazz> what streamers are playing and the state of gaming are two different things
[2022-12-20 11:10:53] <+b1b2betins> morning, BreaK !
[2022-12-20 11:10:56] <%GamerGirl07TV> Tarkov gets the city map now, which is big hype
[2022-12-20 11:10:58] <%fofo8383> restart the count
[2022-12-20 11:11:00] <%JonnyBchn> yeah, keep it
[2022-12-20 11:11:03] <Richie364> the ship combat offered nothing really though, just incentivized people to sit near extract
[2022-12-20 11:11:03] <swedishbastard28> Ello
[2022-12-20 11:11:04] <%kleier> it gets a small bit of the city map *

[2022-12-20 11:11:19] <%+Mr_Wilsonn> @Breakspear bored because they speed run
[2022-12-20 11:11:22] <DonerStoom> I think it suffered from the beta being the whole game, so full launch had little to nothing extra. At least that's how it looks to me

[2022-12-20 12:33:08] <%JonnyTBH> you sliced right after
[2022-12-20 12:33:12] <zorael> the stagger ends immediately after a hit, so the wolf probably bit it imediateky

[2022-12-20 12:59:48] <%Devs1976> personally with how you're struggling towards the end of this fight i would recommend not summoning the wolves off the bat, try getting 3rd hp off
[2022-12-20 12:59:52] <%ZCrimes> could do
[2022-12-20 12:59:58] <FuriousRexus> summon them in the second phase

[2022-12-20 13:31:50] <%+Jessy103> people love watching other people suffer, its why souls is so popular even the older games
[2022-12-20 13:31:50] <%ZCrimes> and tbh, chat is going pretty damn fast, lots of interaction. i like this
[2022-12-20 13:31:56] <%StopClockerman> @StopClockerman it's being described as being drastically different from the originals

[2022-12-20 13:32:08] <%$omgbob_> cant believe i never found that

[2022-12-20 13:32:28] <%pistrencejx> armor core is way more difficult than souls.
[2022-12-20 13:32:29] <zenFX_> @StopClockerman FromSoftware says Armored Core 6 won't emulate Dark Souls or Elden Ring, is all about mech customization
[2022-12-20 13:32:30] <@%GreggStrat> @BreaK Viss tweeted this FYI https://twitter.com/TSMViss/status/1605168747487977472?s=20&t=yzjiUApPgUqqnpwQiDZuGQ

[2022-12-20 13:32:45] <fuhlavaflave> jes figured us out
[2022-12-20 13:32:48] <@%Breakspear> MattySkullz I'm up your way on Xmas day
[2022-12-20 13:32:48] <SoupIsTasty5> No 1st play through experience is like a Souls game, 1st play through. It is it's own thing @BreaK The bosses, the struggle, the traps.
[2022-12-20 13:32:48] <%+Jessy103> you are a bit of a pleb tbf
[2022-12-20 13:32:52] <SoupIsTasty5> It's so so good
[2022-12-20 13:32:55] <FuriousRexus> Right after your own pleasure, others displeasure is not to be scorned, they say. We are a lost race us humans lol
[2022-12-20 13:32:56] <%ZCrimes> @Breakspear imo, nope. its costly in gold and food. you riun your own economy thus fighters too, since they suck if they arent fed or paid
[2022-12-20 13:32:58] <%thirty3baboons> and to 3rd party hear Viss shouting Baby
[2022-12-20 13:33:11] <%ZCrimes> go tackle the easy missions from the town board @Breakspear
[2022-12-20 13:33:12] <%+Seedub7> For Viss not to be streaming, something really wrong must have happened Sadge

[2022-12-20 13:33:40] <%Jacobian1979> Im here because its fun seeing you enjoying games that you write off as 'games that arent for you'
[2022-12-20 13:33:44] <+RJACE_> LUL
[2022-12-20 13:33:51] <%+benwaah> KEKW
[2022-12-20 13:33:57] <%pistrencejx> btw break, try using the special flask, add the red drop into it,  at the grace. basically means you have one more hp bottle
[2022-12-20 13:33:58] <SoupIsTasty5> Plus the way the new player learns and grows, by the end of the play through is always so satisfying
[2022-12-20 13:34:03] <SoupIsTasty5> I love to see it
[2022-12-20 13:34:03] <%thirty3baboons> @Seedub7 Something up with Viss (sorry, I missed that)?
[2022-12-20 13:34:07] <@%Breakspear> ZCrimes Yeah I do that ZCrimes . Apparently the missions you buy off the bloke in the pub are good, but they don't pay money. And I also get lumped with the "Trade amber to Malheim" quest, and I can't get to Malheim
[2022-12-20 13:34:07] <%Frodo1910> i can confirm that I come here to see break suffer
[2022-12-20 13:34:08] <%+MattySkullz> the messages left in soulsborne games are too good

[2022-12-20 13:35:02] <SoupIsTasty5> Just imo
[2022-12-20 13:35:02] <%pistrencejx> the most rewarding quest in the game. no doubt

[2022-12-20 13:35:11] <%ZCrimes> @Breakspear it can be fairly grindy at the start just to make ends meet. easy missions, smaller group. and use influence to get more gold out of it, bargain. and explore, more missions pop up that way. also go into mines and mine them, sell the good stuff, get that gold up

[2022-12-20 13:37:36] <%+Hoogenboomer> English is difficult to be honest
[2022-12-20 13:37:38] <%+dash_dingo_> yeah it's all over the gaff
[2022-12-20 13:37:39] <%Royce55> follow 3 sisters, easy
[2022-12-20 13:37:40] <%Nisseman3> that is so for most
[2022-12-20 13:37:41] <%+Hoogenboomer> kappa
[2022-12-20 13:37:44] <%phr05t_Byt3> A lot of lore in the item descriptions too
[2022-12-20 13:37:44] <%StopClockerman> it always is in these games. have to read every item description to piece it together
[2022-12-20 13:37:52] <%+Zuqar> don't threaten me with a good time Breakspear
[2022-12-20 13:37:53] <JimmyThickness> good to watch a recap video at the end of the playthrough
[2022-12-20 13:37:57] <%+dash_dingo_> have to watch vaatividya to understand wtf is going on
[2022-12-20 13:37:57] <SoupIsTasty5> Without reading all item descriptions, it's tough to follow @BreaK meant to be vague
[2022-12-20 13:38:02] <allt3r> thy lore is much conceived
[2022-12-20 13:38:10] <%ZCrimes> there's no journal. just memory and item descriptions
[2022-12-20 13:38:11] <%$omgbob_> lots of welsh characters in this
[2022-12-20 13:38:16] <%+MrKatarsis> tbh the lore in every form soft game is kind of esoteric
[2022-12-20 13:38:21] <@%Breakspear> cardboardmemory So, let me get this right, you don't like the game, and yet, you seek out a random streamer who is playing this, and come in to moan about it. Don't let the door hit you on the way out kid

[2022-12-20 14:18:46] <%MattySkullz> best thing they did with this game was limiting the map visibility on the map screen, so you dont realise how big the game is at first but then it slowly opens up more and more, so insane. the verticality too with the underground parts, it's mental when you realise that human beings had to sit down and make this entire world, fucking nuts.
[2022-12-20 14:18:47] <%ZCrimes> its legit one of the better, especxially in that price range, a banger
[2022-12-20 14:18:49] <%+Jessy103> noice

[2022-12-20 14:30:14] <%MattySkullz> after elden ring you should go play dark souls
[2022-12-20 14:30:14] <%paddy988> the games that come out in 2023 will show if it was covid or not, if they are still half finished its the devs being lazy
[2022-12-20 14:30:16] <dopehealsbtw> I'm stuck at margic the fell omen 😂
[2022-12-20 14:30:18] <KingPapaLegba> @dopehealsbtw When I started I was horrible at this game. Now I’m at level 295 and very good at it. Trust me if you don’t give up you’ll become great at it.
[2022-12-20 14:30:22] <%ZCrimes> after Ranni, i choose him to simp for
[2022-12-20 14:30:23] <death0fAstrawberry> it's called pre-alpha ... and will be fixed later on  GROUPIUM
[2022-12-20 14:30:28] <Trucido_> mindset is that you can "simply patch it later"
[2022-12-20 14:30:28] <+IconicMB> It wasn't COVID, it's just game studios are cutting more corners now, because they are pressured from their publisher/stockholders
[2022-12-20 14:30:28] <luckytoolucker_> this is easy souls game, but it's first open world Souls game, that's why is popular
[2022-12-20 14:30:28] <%+WantStuff_> Make a 70s ash tray from it

[2022-12-20 14:53:39] <%+Jessy103> yeah but not a main boss
[2022-12-20 14:53:41] <alanfordnr1> you didn't kill main ones
[2022-12-20 14:53:42] <JimmyThickness> Or if you don’t want the weapon from it you can just replicate it and eat the souls for more runes
[2022-12-20 14:53:43] <icucarimu> There are only specific bosses whose souls classify as remembrances
[2022-12-20 14:53:49] <%$Jungle_Jim> He hasn't got any great runes yet AngryArthur
[2022-12-20 14:53:49] <%ZCrimes> yes
[2022-12-20 14:53:50] <%creativityx> yea hes the bridge boss
[2022-12-20 14:53:51] <%Brightsoul1371> Yeah you killed Margie way back
[2022-12-20 14:53:52] <%phr05t_Byt3> Need to kill bosses with a Remembrance
[2022-12-20 14:53:52] <%ZCrimes> you did
[2022-12-20 14:53:56] <%pistrencejx> i think you didn't talk to the "two fingers" maid in the roundtable
[2022-12-20 14:53:59] <%MattySkullz> did he do all of stormveil?
[2022-12-20 14:54:02] <%+besci__> the dragon arm guy you killed has a remembrance you can take it to the round table hold and get a weapon then duplicate the weapon here
[2022-12-20 14:54:06] <%creativityx> @MattySkullz no way
[2022-12-20 14:54:08] <%+Skarym_> @pistrencejx What he said
[2022-12-20 14:54:14] <%tuomasbo1> The mean guy with the cane
[2022-12-20 14:54:18] <%ZCrimes> tbh, u missed so much in Stormveil, just booked through it LUL
[2022-12-20 14:54:18] <+sinisterfire27> You have to have the remembrance in your inventory to duplicate. If you've spent it you can't do it
[2022-12-20 14:54:21] <%+Skarym_> You need to speak to someone at round table where the fingers are
[2022-12-20 14:54:29] <%creativityx> stormveil castle is gigantic tbh
[2022-12-20 14:54:42] <%ZCrimes> lots of rare spots
[2022-12-20 14:54:44] <%MattySkullz> i meant like main boss wise
[2022-12-20 14:54:49] <%pistrencejx> but anyway you won't need his stuff. streng and faith thing

[2022-12-20 15:53:23] <%pistrencejx> katana can't "stun" them, too light.
[2022-12-20 15:53:32] <%Squid___ink> It is the closest grace as the crow flies
[2022-12-20 15:53:35] <%creativityx> @BreaK please rest at the grace and click ashes of war homie
[2022-12-20 15:53:45] <%bills__________> @LoeVG i'm keeping quiet KEKW this is fully fully on me. sorry everyone.
[2022-12-20 15:53:46] <+Yuumen> First playthrough @BreaK ? ^^
[2022-12-20 15:53:48] <%ZCrimes> it can @pistrencejx heavy attacks on anything can
[2022-12-20 15:53:53] <%LoeVG> @bills__________ Madge
[2022-12-20 15:53:55] <%JonnyTBH> isnt there a statue of marika in the boss area
[2022-12-20 15:53:56] <%pistrencejx> @creativityx definitely. and the dancing lady one with frozen blades
[2022-12-20 15:54:18] <%Bugsco> @BreaK My son recons you need to level health (he's a souls geek).
[2022-12-20 15:54:28] <BornLimitless> There is a Stake of Marika (small crucifixtion statue) in the boss area that will give a small checkpoint if you get near it . If you dont get close enough it sends you back to the grace instead
[2022-12-20 15:54:29] <+Yuumen> Aaah awesome! thanks
[2022-12-20 15:54:41] <%ZCrimes> before he levels health, i would try a different area Keepo
[2022-12-20 15:54:53] <%ZCrimes> maybe Caelid Keepo
[2022-12-20 15:54:55] <%creativityx> he doesnt need health, he needs to get souls and level his weapon up
[2022-12-20 15:55:06] <%pistrencejx> @ZCrimes can he upgrade the weapon now? I think he has 2 lvl 3 stones? might do a bit more
[2022-12-20 15:55:09] <%+Skarym_> yeah I spammed health before other things
[2022-12-20 15:55:13] <Holophraser> vigor is always a good idea

[2022-12-20 15:55:37] <%ZCrimes> @pistrencejx didn't pay attention, dunno if he found lvl 3 and 4 yet, smithing stones
[2022-12-20 15:55:38] <RiggsTorvak> my build has 17 vigor and its really damm hard
[2022-12-20 15:55:49] <%creativityx> break could double his damage if he took bleed off his weapon and upgraded it
[2022-12-20 15:55:56] <%creativityx> in seconds
[2022-12-20 15:56:21] <%ZCrimes> i love the determination
[2022-12-20 15:56:38] <%pistrencejx> can you check how many stones you have?

[2022-12-20 15:59:36] <Holophraser> keen is good if you have high dex
[2022-12-20 15:59:37] <%creativityx> if you put magic or cold damage, it will hit harder
[2022-12-20 15:59:39] <%+Skarym_> @ZCrimes I thought it was the sheathe unsheathe ability by default
[2022-12-20 15:59:46] <%creativityx> look at the blue numbers in the middle of the screen @BreaK

[2022-12-20 16:00:01] <%ZCrimes> @sk33per it still applies bleed by default
[2022-12-20 16:00:06] <%MattySkullz> its ash of war by default is unsheathe but it still has bleed
[2022-12-20 16:00:14] <%MitosisDNB> @creativityx but magic and cold scales of int and he has no int…
[2022-12-20 16:00:19] <%HallvardGN> keen for dex build

[2022-12-20 16:00:38] <%creativityx> @MitosisDNB so it ends up hitting harder even with no secondary scaling
[2022-12-20 16:00:39] <%pistrencejx> check your stones tho, might be able to upgrade
