[2022-12-24 05:15:57] <%GoRibGo> they also don't auto resub so you gotta do it each month
[2022-12-24 05:15:57] <%$Bolbor> which given how much I watch twitch is good
[2022-12-24 05:16:02] <Hohen__> turbo is worth
[2022-12-24 05:16:03] <%Dyrk> prime and turbo used to be similar, but they got rid of the no ads with prime
[2022-12-24 05:16:05] <%$Bolbor> my turbo autoresubs fine

[2022-12-24 05:16:44] <%+nilockin> Twitch chat got my back
[2022-12-24 05:16:45] <$NeverEndingPizza> Im honestly suprised they havent gotten rid of the prime subs
[2022-12-24 05:17:15] <Icion> i think they will keep Prime but if i had to guess they will drop the split %
[2022-12-24 05:17:15] <ReformingOne> I'm sure its coming Pizza
[2022-12-24 05:17:24] <%+Zmpr0wler> one thing i wish this game did was we could use spray paint to mark locations that we have checked
[2022-12-24 05:17:27] <$NeverEndingPizza> but ofc they just keep jacking price up of prime itself
[2022-12-24 05:17:33] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> Im not, they probably see it as a way to break down the barrier from non-paying to paying users
[2022-12-24 05:17:55] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-24 05:17:56] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> like, if you get a 'free' sub you're probably more likely to sub with actual money too?
[2022-12-24 05:17:57] <+X_eroz> it would be dumb if they did @neverendingpizza prime is free amazon marketing and incentive to keep it
[2022-12-24 05:18:01] <%$h4rdcorenub> Prime Video is kinda cool
[2022-12-24 05:18:24] <Hohen__> random games, one sub, free shipping, some AWS features
[2022-12-24 05:18:35] <DinoAttack> gateway sub
[2022-12-24 05:18:36] <$NeverEndingPizza> @x_eroz nobody is keeping amazon prime for twitch prime though
[2022-12-24 05:18:46] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> once you break down that first barrier of spending money it's more likely top spend additional money
[2022-12-24 05:18:48] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> is my theory
[2022-12-24 05:18:58] <%GoRibGo> ha not me I'm to broke to support more then one lol
[2022-12-24 05:19:09] <%SpadesOmega> dick took my subginity
[2022-12-24 05:19:22] <Hohen__> giving away money to parasocial relationships is mildly addictive

[2022-12-24 05:36:27] <$InfinitumDiver> Oh yeah, there's a ton
[2022-12-24 05:36:45] <%Dyrk> in previous runs
[2022-12-24 05:37:15] <%$h4rdcorenub> we reload over here. but I dont have 41 cal dies
[2022-12-24 05:37:28] <$InfinitumDiver> LUL yup, when you start getting into some of those rounds that not a lot people know
[2022-12-24 05:37:35] <%Twisted_Circle> @GoRibGo Yup, .357 is definitely a thing. Still is.
[2022-12-24 05:37:50] <Norwazy> we had a few 41 cal guns up in the mountains I worked

[2022-12-24 05:38:08] <%GoRibGo> neat I didnt make it up lol is that the common repeater round?
[2022-12-24 05:38:17] <Lodazal> 12 mm was popular in the civil war apparently
[2022-12-24 05:38:19] <$InfinitumDiver> 357 and 44 are the most common in that area
[2022-12-24 05:38:31] <%Twisted_Circle> @GoRibGo It's a pistol round, typically loaded as magnum.
[2022-12-24 05:38:39] <$InfinitumDiver> 45-70 is a beast
[2022-12-24 05:38:51] <%GoRibGo> ah okay thanks, I don't know shit about guns
[2022-12-24 05:39:15] <$InfinitumDiver> 30-30 is great but most try to go to 7.62x39mm instead
[2022-12-24 05:39:20] <brdWizard> lotta wild calibers came with some specific rifles
[2022-12-24 05:39:29] <%GoRibGo> I recall 308 from fallout lol
[2022-12-24 05:39:36] <brdWizard> or experimental guns, but like 7mm
[2022-12-24 05:39:40] <$InfinitumDiver> 243 is pretty good too
[2022-12-24 05:39:53] <%$Bolbor> 336 or bust
[2022-12-24 05:39:54] <+X_eroz> I HAD a 30-30 coming my way (my dad had it) with a Leopold scope worth more than the gun on it. but he sold it to a work buddy smoketvRip

[2022-12-24 05:40:06] <$InfinitumDiver> yeah 308 is basically 7.62x51
[2022-12-24 05:40:28] <%$h4rdcorenub> 7.62x51m is the same as .308. but 7.62x39 and 7.62x55R are very differetn

[2022-12-24 05:43:47] <%+Tangygoat> 7.62 is expensive my company just bought a ton “barrels”and it was expensive still

[2022-12-24 05:45:14] <Norwazy> you can mail guns piece by piece, just take em apart
[2022-12-24 05:45:14] <$InfinitumDiver> Has to go through a FFL for "gun"
[2022-12-24 05:45:15] <%+Tangygoat> I think we paid $1 a round most of the 7.62 is gone and going to Ukraine so it’s hard to come by in large quantities

[2022-12-24 06:00:23] <vhzod> If you don't have any gear it's just easier to just start over if you get stuck in a wolf struggle but it takes like 5 minutes to be able to get to the menu
[2022-12-24 06:00:51] <vhzod> And usually there's more than one wolf so they all get their turn on you before you can reload or restart

[2022-12-24 06:52:53] <%Icion> Its a vicious cycle

[2022-12-24 07:01:43] <vhzod> Maybe they're more aggressive in wintermute, but basically by the time you see them you're already in their aggro radius

[2022-12-24 07:29:25] <%vertxxyz> if they built an ad-powered Prime JO machine that'd work

[2022-12-24 07:29:54] <%$DuranDuranDuran> The ads have become so cancerous recently. Click on a stream and get pre-rolls - 5 minutes later 1/12 ads.
[2022-12-24 07:30:08] <Fleepflammer> everyone hates ads dude, but they're literally just apart of life at this point, so atleast this way they're benefiting an individual in some way vs just straight going to a corpo

[2022-12-24 07:30:57] <EnigmaticRepose> I still get prerolls on the channels that run ads
[2022-12-24 07:30:58] <%+Zmpr0wler> i wouldnt mind if the streamer could press the ad button and take a break
[2022-12-24 07:31:02] <%capellp> the others got the message LUL
[2022-12-24 07:31:07] <%K9kroz> turbo is the only way
[2022-12-24 07:31:13] <@%BranLan> I know there's a lot of "glitches" that occur that cause pre rolls to run anyway. allegedly they're caused by adblockers that don't work
[2022-12-24 07:31:16] <grease_police> Wolf steak dinner?
[2022-12-24 07:31:23] <%K9kroz> incorrect
[2022-12-24 07:31:34] <EnigmaticRepose> It used to do that, but stopped when they started throwing out these contracts
[2022-12-24 07:31:41] <%vhzod> Hmm I think the original pre-rolls still happen, but the quick switch pre-roll didn't happen
[2022-12-24 07:31:43] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> I thought it was like 3 minutes an hour or something to disable pre-rolls?
[2022-12-24 07:31:43] <JoshCraze> I haven't had any pre rolls joining your stream. Still get it in others
[2022-12-24 07:32:02] <%K9kroz> SeemsGood
[2022-12-24 07:32:09] <%+eEKBAh> yea as streamers we see when the ads run and how long the pre rolls are off
[2022-12-24 07:32:15] <EnigmaticRepose> I have no doubt it's the intention, but this is Twitch.

[2022-12-24 07:32:55] <SharAzurian> Also their back-end stuff has been known to break. I was subbed to a channel and had turbo, back at the end of October, still got 3-5 minutes of ads every hour... just things working as advertised lol
[2022-12-24 07:32:59] <%+EJ_LEG8> there was a guy that has a little timer on his stream so chat can remind him and also know when adds are incoming
[2022-12-24 07:32:59] <ChemicalScum> good morning
[2022-12-24 07:33:15] <Saighdear173> If someone enters the stream when the midrolls are going do they get that ad? Because to them it would seem like a preroll even if it wasn't.
[2022-12-24 07:33:43] <%$templarofflame> i just wish the ads werent intrusive as all hell, non-volume controlled.. .and didnt break all hte damn time if they are going to force it so hard
[2022-12-24 07:33:43] <%$DuranDuranDuran> They still aren't particularly profitable. Amazon is cracking the whip, hence the greater ad density.

[2022-12-24 07:34:49] <%$templarofflame> i also miss when amazon prime gave us the benefits of turbo like it did ages ago :(
[2022-12-24 07:34:51] <%Kardmager> I’m sure twitch is profitable but profits always need to go up
[2022-12-24 07:35:00] <%vhzod> I remember discussion of twitch losing amazon money

[2022-12-24 08:16:47] <%+nilockin> I don't think Dave was that old. That was the guy was having like half a fish a day right? He saved half his food and starved himself?
[2022-12-24 08:16:49] <dingo2345> @vhzod yeah it's not realistic in this game, but the dev wants to demotivate you from eating only wolves meat
[2022-12-24 08:17:35] <%+Zmpr0wler> work cost calories and calories cost a lot of work

[2022-12-24 08:18:47] <%vertxxyz> there was that woman who was all into hunting and really up themselves and the moment a few bears were around she freaked
[2022-12-24 08:18:59] <%vhzod> At least you don't have to worry about venting the smoke
[2022-12-24 08:19:09] <brdWizard> at best you get some kooky jack london naturalist, goes downhill from there
[2022-12-24 08:19:17] <Lodazal> couldnt you just gain a ton of weight before going on?
[2022-12-24 08:19:24] <%Darmanimon> at least you don't enjoy rolling coal Kappa
[2022-12-24 08:19:37] <%KiddProQuo> Liking something adjacent to survival and thinking you can do that as a result reminds me of people who like to cook and think they could open a successful restaurant.
[2022-12-24 08:20:20] <%vertxxyz> @Lodazal people do put on some weight before going on, but there's a limit to whether you want to put that on yourself if you want to leave, get injured, etc
[2022-12-24 08:20:27] <%+Zmpr0wler> ? wiff of what
[2022-12-24 08:20:29] VIEWERS: 661
[2022-12-24 08:20:37] <%Darmanimon> as many people in my family have found out, it takes so much more to run a successful restaurant than making good food
[2022-12-24 08:20:41] <%goldwolf214> how can this meat take over an hour to cook
[2022-12-24 08:20:44] <%KiddProQuo> Totally.
[2022-12-24 08:20:51] <brdWizard> you also have to carry it
[2022-12-24 08:21:02] <%+nilockin> You're not allowed to lose more than a certain amount of weight or it has serious health implications Lodazal. Even fat people can't lose that much
[2022-12-24 08:21:02] <Deleroth> I've been very effective at putting weight on over the past two years
[2022-12-24 08:21:10] <%Darmanimon> the more body fat you have, the more you need to intake to maintain it
[2022-12-24 08:21:50] <Merc_The_Jerk> and your body with burning all that fat can be harmful to your other organs iirc. has to be a slow burn
[2022-12-24 08:21:50] <%Darmanimon> also fat isn't as good a source of energy as say sugar
[2022-12-24 08:22:01] <%goldwolf214> how many of the 90 days are in winter
[2022-12-24 08:22:03] <%vhzod> Well some people have better genes for that than others
[2022-12-24 08:22:07] <%+nilockin> If you lose too much of your body weight too quickly your body will eat at your heart muscles and the show will disqualify you
[2022-12-24 08:22:31] <Squirrelpool> When I was weightlifting everyday I had to eat something like 3800 calories to maintain. I stopped and dropped weight and I can go so much longer on so much less food.
