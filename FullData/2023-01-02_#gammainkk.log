[2023-01-02 12:15:22] <+XFoxNikosX> The last episode of Legend of Korra that I remember was Korra and Asami going into the avatar realm at the end. I don't know if they made anymore episodes after that.
[2023-01-02 12:15:24] <%+AzzaNine> earth has lava bending too

[2023-01-02 12:16:59] <%kiLo217> idk
[2023-01-02 12:17:00] <%+AzzaNine> you could do the oposite of ice formation and make steam explosions

[2023-01-02 12:17:16] <%$kiriosthanatos> @RedCometAU like she needs powers to do that dreamy30Eyebrows
[2023-01-02 12:17:18] <AL3X_F0X> My favourite character was Toff. Also, I always wondered if there was a air bender so power that he could make extremely concetrated air blasts that punches holes into/through walls.
[2023-01-02 12:17:39] <!+heckelchris> @denniz93 but that would be helping gamma by making them big
[2023-01-02 12:17:46] <%kiLo217> cortorize wounds with fire
[2023-01-02 12:17:51] <+swedish_penguin> in theory cant airbenders take the air from your lungs
[2023-01-02 12:17:53] <quontox> what is fire bending though
[2023-01-02 12:17:54] <kelly_ld111> you can fly ?
[2023-01-02 12:17:59] <%Xideta> Heating tea?

[2023-01-02 12:18:09] <zachtherage> You can make yourself tea with fire bending KEKW
[2023-01-02 12:18:11] <diclonius_clarent> with fire couldn't you technically make plasma?
[2023-01-02 12:18:11] <+swedish_penguin> like they can suffocate you
[2023-01-02 12:18:12] <%$kiriosthanatos> technically u could expand the air in peoples lungs, that would be horrific
[2023-01-02 12:18:14] <!%+LittleThymbol> You can light a candle
[2023-01-02 12:18:18] <+ryukosho> ayo? heating tea hell yeah

[2023-01-02 12:18:55] <Denniz93> no because theres only a smal amout of space for the blood
[2023-01-02 12:18:56] <%$kiriosthanatos> Fartbending

[2023-01-02 12:19:11] <myrkiz_est> Water can also Woodbend Kreygasm
[2023-01-02 12:19:11] <NyKoR97> you can sufficate someone with airbending
[2023-01-02 12:19:12] <%$kiriosthanatos> cupcake that shit

[2023-01-02 12:19:32] <%+Mkashtastic> do you think a large group of air benders could cause meteorlogical effects?
[2023-01-02 12:19:38] <+swedish_penguin> no
[2023-01-02 12:19:41] <@%ThatVtuberAlex> you can see it when its dusty
[2023-01-02 12:19:45] <%kiLo217> no we can only see it for the tv it's invisible
[2023-01-02 12:19:47] <+swedish_penguin> they would look insane

[2023-01-02 12:19:56] <Denniz93> no only if theres sand in the air
[2023-01-02 12:20:00] <%$kiriosthanatos> if u used airbending to suffocate someone, people would only see the person struggling

[2023-01-02 12:20:12] <!+heckelchris> What you mean like the live action last airbender with all the hand waving
[2023-01-02 12:20:12] <%+Zero_gs> depends on the air attack they use as torrnados and harricans are visable and some other types of winds are also visable
[2023-01-02 12:20:15] <%kiLo217> well air can lift shit if you put enough efort into it

[2023-01-02 12:20:19] <diclonius_clarent> you could make a vacuum if you remove all the air in room

[2023-01-02 12:20:47] [Notification] furno_alphaghost subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! [firebender can use their own body heat to bend fire. Air special ability is shown in Avatar: the legend of Kora. if the became detached from their emotion they can fly without needinf to do bending. Also you forgot metalbending]
[2023-01-02 12:20:49] <between_the_voids> look it up
[2023-01-02 12:20:51] <%Master_Beta69420> Theres sound bending isnt there?
[2023-01-02 12:20:52] <AL3X_F0X> Air bending is fully effective in stealth since it has so many utilities for knocking people out. If you can fire projectiles or other large structures at people then you don't need to worry about detection.

[2023-01-02 13:07:10] <%$kiriosthanatos> black flag was a good pirate game, not ac game
[2023-01-02 13:07:16] <%kiLo217> how tf they have 12 games tho tf
[2023-01-02 13:07:35] <%+machacha_fulgrim> yea black flag was more pirate
[2023-01-02 13:07:38] <f1uffy_unicorns> I think black flag was my first AC because it was free on Xbox gold one month
[2023-01-02 13:07:46] <%$kiriosthanatos> from origins it went too RPG
[2023-01-02 13:07:49] <AtrophyAtomic> Origin, Odessy, and Vahalla were a soft reboot trilogy, everything in the past bits are before all the other games, but then the modern day bits are a continuation
[2023-01-02 13:07:53] <%+machacha_fulgrim> origins, Odyssey, and then Valhalla
[2023-01-02 13:08:00] <%kiLo217> wait you have the AC logo as a tatto0?
[2023-01-02 13:08:03] <PhantomFlan> Unity is pretty much where the series started going downhill
