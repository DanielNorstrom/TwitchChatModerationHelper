[2023-01-11 12:40:16] VIEWERS: 1¬†607
[2023-01-11 12:40:27] <%Redvid1> and if fame was the same as the open world mobs the camps would be more contsested so even tho spawn rate is insane more fight could come out of that
[2023-01-11 12:40:39] <%Redvid1> so i dont think it would break the game that much
