[2023-01-07 17:30:45] <%Inviiti> @bar10dr so think of a basic electrical line, and after gets in and rust/corrodes it and that cause bad signal, interference, just problems in general. Pressure on the line keeps moisture out and being nitrogen is dry it drys up moisture and keeps the line from being 200 degrees
[2023-01-07 17:31:24] <%$bar10dr> Aha, I see, that's pretty clever. Thanks for explaining.

[2023-01-07 17:32:59] <%$bar10dr> I assume the leaks usually happens at the interface points at the ends?  Not on a random places along the stretch of the cable housing?
[2023-01-07 17:33:49] <%Inviiti> I wish lol, it can happen anywhere on the cable/hardline: the worst part is climbing up to find the peak on a 1000ff+ tower lol

[2023-01-07 17:35:53] <%Inviiti> Luckily it‚Äôs 65 out today. But winter does suck cause it‚Äôs always colder up there lol
[2023-01-07 17:36:02] <%Fufcia> @lukasalbert rather after him
[2023-01-07 17:36:12] <%aundros> guess you really have to trust your gear that high up. I could not do that. I'd be worried a part would break
[2023-01-07 17:36:56] <Atzgee> pepeSmoke
[2023-01-07 17:37:01] <%$bar10dr> Can you egress with rope or something, or do you have to climb down the tower manually as well? Up is okay, but down... yeah nope
[2023-01-07 17:37:22] <%Inviiti> Absolutely, trusting the heat is usually what makes or breaks new guys.
[2023-01-07 17:37:23] <Flobu_> hey
[2023-01-07 17:37:27] <lukasalbert> @lukasalbert ahh thanks
[2023-01-07 17:37:27] <%Inviiti> Gear*
[2023-01-07 17:37:37] <Flobu_> waht do oyu think is the DML system working correctly when he ogs on?

[2023-01-07 17:38:03] <%Inviiti> @bar10dr it depends, some you manually climb up and down. Some have a elevator lol.
[2023-01-07 17:38:12] <%$bar10dr> Oooh elevator
[2023-01-07 17:38:14] <%aundros> elevator!?
[2023-01-07 17:39:14] <%Inviiti> Yea it‚Äôs just a platform within the tower that you stand on that is operated by cables
[2023-01-07 17:39:28] <%$bar10dr> I bet its one of those jobs that gets really dangerous after you get used to it and stop getting scared
[2023-01-07 17:40:16] <%Inviiti> @bar10dr absolutely, I think there‚Äôs a statistic somewhere that most injuries occur to people that have been working  5years or more.
[2023-01-07 17:41:04] <%$bar10dr> Yeah makes sense, so once your heart rate stops going up during a climb its time to move on dude :D
[2023-01-07 17:41:13] <%aundros> Do you guys ever have to clear snow from the towers?
[2023-01-07 17:41:28] <%Inviiti> Pretty much lol.
[2023-01-07 17:42:18] <%Inviiti> @aundros not really snow, AM towers you can turn a high frequency up where the whole tower vibrates and it‚Äôll knock ice off before the climb.

[2023-01-07 18:25:24] <lukasalbert> uraninite turns into that waffle
[2023-01-07 18:25:25] <v33o> COPIUM
[2023-01-07 18:25:25] <%+Eilavamp> Use the dust to make the dust?
[2023-01-07 18:25:40] <%+Schutter07> smelt it
[2023-01-07 18:25:43] <lukasalbert> smelt it yeah
[2023-01-07 18:25:49] <+Koeckie> you should really disconnect everything you don't need
[2023-01-07 18:25:53] <lukasalbert> its super cheap to jump start it
[2023-01-07 18:26:13] <%+Angel0death> Just started this pack. I hate you waffle :'(
[2023-01-07 18:26:15] <weightmaker> priority doesnt work with round robin
[2023-01-07 18:26:20] <Code4Coffee> What do those chambers do
[2023-01-07 18:26:30] <%DX_Plates> I think I already have it
[2023-01-07 18:26:34] <%aundros> Do we need to double the production here to cover the whole system?
[2023-01-07 18:26:36] <%DX_Plates> Fairly sure
[2023-01-07 18:26:40] <v33o> oh are they like woot?
[2023-01-07 18:26:42] <%$frainsbreeze> did the system break or was it good?
[2023-01-07 18:26:54] <Code4Coffee> ah yes of course
[2023-01-07 18:26:56] <lukasalbert> system stalled

[2023-01-07 18:27:01] <%+intimdatr> I have spent so much time working on Withcer 3, Noita is next on the chopping block
[2023-01-07 18:27:17] <kakiewakie_> do it
[2023-01-07 18:27:18] <GGoodGGuy> just use cheats :D
[2023-01-07 18:27:21] <lukasalbert> 1
[2023-01-07 18:27:22] <kakiewakie_> big wall of smelters
[2023-01-07 18:27:22] <%mechoriet> @frainsbreeze Copege its good it worked well for a hour probbly then died
[2023-01-07 18:27:24] <+Mfdtgamer> can you boost them any?
[2023-01-07 18:27:24] <tomey36> But you ran out of pearls
[2023-01-07 18:27:24] <+sp4wn999> speed upgrrade FTW
[2023-01-07 18:27:25] <IAmJester> you didn't math this out before you started building?
[2023-01-07 18:27:25] <%Smithii> Starting to sound like IGBLON :D
[2023-01-07 18:27:30] <%+Schutter07> maybe you can disconnect the storage bus to see if enderpearl route correctly
[2023-01-07 18:27:32] <%TheIrishGuy> yah 1
[2023-01-07 18:27:32] <lukasalbert> it always uses 1
[2023-01-07 18:27:35] <forfiet> saysit failed
[2023-01-07 18:27:35] <gikei> Time to use math
[2023-01-07 18:27:43] <%+lvyEartman> science it to check if its enough
[2023-01-07 18:27:45] <Shantrix> 1 with 30%
[2023-01-07 18:27:45] <jayrickson87> you need to upgrade alloy smelters to EV
[2023-01-07 18:27:56] <%omar21cu> waffleEE MathTime
[2023-01-07 18:27:56] <+Face_32> its all maffs
[2023-01-07 18:27:57] <%0sem0> you did not math it to begin with?
[2023-01-07 18:27:58] <lukasalbert> more alloy smelters ?
[2023-01-07 18:28:00] <Vovosunt> could always put more smelters above?
[2023-01-07 18:28:00] <%gartoks> @Giantwaffle 15.05 seconds per run
[2023-01-07 18:28:02] <%TheIrishGuy> 15 seconds you timed it before
[2023-01-07 18:28:03] <+noxiiiouse> you did already 15sec
[2023-01-07 18:28:06] <+dcjrracing11> Is there a multi lock alloy smelter that‚Äôs faster?
[2023-01-07 18:28:07] <%bobolpwnz> MathTime
[2023-01-07 18:28:15] <her0zer0> it's probably just since there were so many basic running at the same time with horrible drop chance
[2023-01-07 18:28:16] <%Zapper_777> math the ratio.. is 199iq
[2023-01-07 18:28:17] <highlandermccloud> I think the priorities are the issue @giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:28:24] <+IlsaGold> Have we got any of this stuff on the servers, as a debug?

[2023-01-07 18:29:19] <kakiewakie_> no?
[2023-01-07 18:29:23] <kakiewakie_> math?
[2023-01-07 18:29:24] <Daryl_Kay> Some people were saying round robin doesn't work with priorities, you could prioritize to a drawer and then round robin from there? @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:29:28] <lukasalbert> yeah around 10
[2023-01-07 18:29:28] <+Koeckie> 600 per min
[2023-01-07 18:29:28] <%gartoks> Need about 24 enderman models just for the polymer clay
[2023-01-07 18:29:31] <+strickyR> YEP
[2023-01-07 18:29:46] <%Zapper_777> so 9
[2023-01-07 18:30:00] <%+Traverus98> do you need more loot thingies making pearls
[2023-01-07 18:30:02] <trabadam> me thinks it stalled due to 6:1 ration is not valid until all of them are self-aware , so you run out of enderperls peepoHmm @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:30:09] <CoolReal> Was the system broken?
[2023-01-07 18:30:14] <%$frainsbreeze> maybe put in item filter in the sim chambers with 8 poly clay
[2023-01-07 18:30:16] <niborkees> technically once the system is full you will never need 9.5 a sec anymore
[2023-01-07 18:30:23] <%Zapper_777> make a screen with a graph :D
[2023-01-07 18:30:24] <%TheIrishGuy> make the drawer bigger
[2023-01-07 18:30:29] <+sp4wn999> dont you have like 100k ender prestine in the ME ?
[2023-01-07 18:30:34] <+MrSilverMatch> Still, it gave polymer clay to simulation chamber with lower priorities so nope RR doesn‚Äôt care about priority
[2023-01-07 18:30:39] <%TigerLuv> add one line at a time, to see when you need more?
[2023-01-07 18:30:47] <%aundros> Don't you just need a bigger buffer for the clay?
[2023-01-07 18:30:50] <Bulltank> it round robins the stack anyways
[2023-01-07 18:30:57] VIEWERS: 1¬†235
[2023-01-07 18:31:00] <kakiewakie_> calculate how much ur generating now
[2023-01-07 18:31:05] <%Slymph> In case it hasn't been mentioned, KSP is free on epic today peepoPat
[2023-01-07 18:31:05] <lukasalbert> the alloy smelters should be filling
[2023-01-07 18:31:06] <%TigerLuv> draw limit?
[2023-01-07 18:31:06] <deadgolfer> drawer is maxed
[2023-01-07 18:31:07] <+Reimzu> upgrade drawer
[2023-01-07 18:31:08] <%+lvyEartman> make the buffer much bigger?
[2023-01-07 18:31:14] <%Zapper_777> we need a enderpearl to clay ratio screen :D
[2023-01-07 18:31:14] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:31:15] <%$frainsbreeze> maybe control the ender fluid too? you might waste it eventually
[2023-01-07 18:31:17] <highlandermccloud> @giantwaffle what if it's filling storage some where else in the base
[2023-01-07 18:31:34] <WhyYouPayMoney> Yeah, what if we disconnect the inventory from the rest of the base?
[2023-01-07 18:31:37] <kane1941> WAILA says 3
[2023-01-07 18:31:55] <kakiewakie_> seems fast
[2023-01-07 18:31:57] <%bobolpwnz> every 3 sec
[2023-01-07 18:31:57] <%$frainsbreeze> you can see the time on the alloy smelter
[2023-01-07 18:31:58] <+Koeckie> check it !
[2023-01-07 18:31:59] <%Zapper_777> can you make a production ticker :D
[2023-01-07 18:31:59] <RefiixGaming> Waila is right it seems
[2023-01-07 18:32:02] <DemonsDawn> i dont think it was that fast
[2023-01-07 18:32:05] <her0zer0> 1.5s seems way faster than it's actually going
[2023-01-07 18:32:06] <Sulheim> ULV to LV doesn't half time
[2023-01-07 18:32:07] <%+Tasar_> is there a power issue?
[2023-01-07 18:32:08] <Bulltank> I dont think thats correct
[2023-01-07 18:32:20] <highlandermccloud> @giantwaffle what if it's filling storage some where else in the base
[2023-01-07 18:32:22] <deadgolfer> drawer is maxed out for clay

[2023-01-07 18:33:32] <+Koeckie> not enough? too many
[2023-01-07 18:33:32] <%aundros> Maybe its max for that tier of machine?
[2023-01-07 18:33:37] <%Zapper_777> ok 12sec, how many do you have?
[2023-01-07 18:33:37] <%+notRoro> it might be rounding up
[2023-01-07 18:33:39] <%$frainsbreeze> get another energy converter?
[2023-01-07 18:33:41] <Fnack> second energy converter maybe?
[2023-01-07 18:33:42] <kane1941> Cut the power line in half
[2023-01-07 18:33:43] <drsnaki96> what does whaila say when the machine is set to MV then?
[2023-01-07 18:33:47] <%maimvice13> max vor ther recepie
[2023-01-07 18:33:48] <+Koeckie> connect a second one
[2023-01-07 18:34:06] <CoolReal> HUH
[2023-01-07 18:34:10] <lukasalbert> you could also try adding more power
[2023-01-07 18:34:11] <goldenknight22> maybe tooltip is bugged?
[2023-01-07 18:34:11] <flamingblaster> is it amperage
[2023-01-07 18:34:11] <%$frainsbreeze> HUH
[2023-01-07 18:34:12] <%Bunjimus> wonder if you need another hv power thing
[2023-01-07 18:34:12] <Bulltank> Its 1 tier down
[2023-01-07 18:34:13] <%mechoriet> maybe waila scuff with 0-3 and 1-3 kinda shit
[2023-01-07 18:34:16] <%Zapper_777> ok.. now its at 3 sec
[2023-01-07 18:34:17] <%+Tasar_> @frainsbreeze nice
[2023-01-07 18:34:17] <%Smithii> Use the gregtech depug tool?
[2023-01-07 18:34:18] <lukasalbert> even if it wont make a differece
[2023-01-07 18:34:21] <ThuhMonty> Maybe too much power being used at one time?
[2023-01-07 18:34:22] <%Zapper_777> it was 12
[2023-01-07 18:34:23] <%maimvice13> make a second energy converter at the line
[2023-01-07 18:34:24] <+Swocoom> time to tier up?
[2023-01-07 18:34:25] <%+Traverus98> Maybe the recipe requires LV so power goes down a tier as a result
[2023-01-07 18:34:28] <RefiixGaming> No it is really 3 secs and should be 1.5
[2023-01-07 18:34:28] <+Shank_nasty> Higher amps?
[2023-01-07 18:34:29] <lukasalbert> @Giantwaffle time it ?
[2023-01-07 18:34:30] <%+Traverus98> try a ULV recipe
[2023-01-07 18:34:31] <%Hugzie89> logicallyit has to be a supply issue
[2023-01-07 18:34:32] <%Winstonrocks> The recipe is ULV which isnt possible LV is the lowest
[2023-01-07 18:34:51] <%DaemonSzyman> No because a lot of recipes are ULV
[2023-01-07 18:34:57] VIEWERS: 1¬†373
[2023-01-07 18:35:00] <+Matini97> maybe u can only overclock to one tier lower
[2023-01-07 18:35:02] <%Winstonrocks> if the recipe is tiered down yes
[2023-01-07 18:35:03] <lilgangstagoth1> if there wasnt enough power in the line the machines just would get enough power not run a tier lower
[2023-01-07 18:35:04] <%+Traverus98> Oh I guess this is a ULV recipe
[2023-01-07 18:35:06] <+BirchTheTree> @Winstonrocks thats false. ULV is just the power requirements
[2023-01-07 18:35:10] <%Zapper_777> its not getting pulled out fast enuf? its stuffed at a stack?
[2023-01-07 18:35:12] <mahoriiii77> build more can fix
[2023-01-07 18:35:17] <+ns0z> @Giantwaffle Do you have access to Naquadah yet?
[2023-01-07 18:35:24] <%Winstonrocks> @BirchTheTree yes but the lowest machine tier is LV
[2023-01-07 18:35:25] <%0sem0> maybe it can not provide the amperage?
[2023-01-07 18:35:27] <%Nickonil> is there a speed upgrade or power upgrade you can put in it?
[2023-01-07 18:35:32] <%maimvice13> not enough AMP
[2023-01-07 18:35:32] <+SwedishKaito> power loss due to wires?

[2023-01-07 18:35:39] <%DaemonSzyman> I can log in and check on the KKona server if you want

[2023-01-07 18:35:39] <%Hugzie89> connect a single one to a converter and test
[2023-01-07 18:35:44] <pufflefump> Is the power transmission constrained by the EnderIO cables?
[2023-01-07 18:35:48] <%mechoriet> maybe try a extra power converter just to check
[2023-01-07 18:35:49] <kane1941> anyways 20 every 3 = 7 every 1
[2023-01-07 18:35:49] <kakiewakie_> KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:35:55] <%Zapper_777> its to slow to pull from the machine?
[2023-01-07 18:35:55] <lukasalbert> per alloy yeah
[2023-01-07 18:36:01] <%TheIrishGuy> which is enough
[2023-01-07 18:36:04] <kakiewakie_> hmmmm
[2023-01-07 18:36:05] <RefiixGaming> So we are good
[2023-01-07 18:36:08] <+BirchTheTree> @Winstonrocks lowest electrical machine yes. ULV is techincally steam age which was removed in this pack
[2023-01-07 18:36:08] <lilgangstagoth1> dont think its power the machines have full buffers
[2023-01-07 18:36:08] <lukasalbert> it should be way more than enough
[2023-01-07 18:36:08] <RefiixGaming> We need only 9

[2023-01-07 18:36:35] <%+DecertoJonesy> maybe not getting enough enderpearls?
[2023-01-07 18:36:35] <%+Purecrew> But are you making enough resonant ender as well
[2023-01-07 18:36:37] <Daanaas> is it chunk load
[2023-01-07 18:36:41] <weightmaker> just tested it on patreon server and round robin completely ignores priority
[2023-01-07 18:36:42] <%+Traverus98> Do you need more loot generators making pearls
[2023-01-07 18:36:44] <Koristbuh> If those are building a buffer you are making enough, no?
[2023-01-07 18:36:45] <banutzul> maybe you are not making enough pearls
[2023-01-07 18:36:46] <lukasalbert> where are you smelting the clathrates ?
[2023-01-07 18:36:47] <%mechoriet> @Daanaas YEP
[2023-01-07 18:36:48] <highlandermccloud> I think your priority system is messed up @giantwaffle  or it's storing stuff some where else in the base
[2023-01-07 18:36:49] <%+lvyEartman> science it
[2023-01-07 18:36:49] <%maimvice13> can you put more amp on the wire with a extra energy convert 16a
[2023-01-07 18:36:52] <kane1941> not enough pearls
[2023-01-07 18:36:52] <%+That0neGeye> It‚Äôs not pulling out of the machines fast enough
[2023-01-07 18:36:52] <razborsek> Maybe not enough enderman sim chambers?
[2023-01-07 18:36:53] <her0zer0> nothing is backing up so it's just not enough overall throughout. I think it's because of all the training
[2023-01-07 18:36:53] <flamingblaster> are you making enough clay?
[2023-01-07 18:36:54] <%$frainsbreeze> also drawer upgrades
[2023-01-07 18:36:56] <Daryl_Kay> You may have not been making enough ender pearls because the level was lower
[2023-01-07 18:36:57] <matori666> pulsating ender is the bottleneck i think

[2023-01-07 18:37:00] <%mechoriet> bug or cable overload?
[2023-01-07 18:37:01] <%DaemonSzyman> Break the machine and place it back?
[2023-01-07 18:37:06] <%$frainsbreeze> maybe get another energy converter?
[2023-01-07 18:37:14] <+DynamixBoon> Could it be the non-selfware endermen are not creating enough pristine?
[2023-01-07 18:37:15] <%Winstonrocks> @BirchTheTree Yes true but all the recipes work like this so im not sure why but if it uses ULV it down tiers one voltage\
[2023-01-07 18:37:15] <%Hugzie89> @Giantwaffle connect a single one to a converter and test
[2023-01-07 18:37:28] <%Allmostdone> Why would one be correct? And the others not?
[2023-01-07 18:37:30] <%nesse007> try to split the  power? and see
[2023-01-07 18:37:34] <%+SmokyMtnRed> Nerdge
[2023-01-07 18:37:34] <Daanaas> is it chunk load
[2023-01-07 18:37:40] <%Zapper_777> but there is stack in the machines... the buffe dont work?
[2023-01-07 18:37:43] <deadgolfer> just disconnect all the sim chambers expect for the enderman chambers and see if it fills
[2023-01-07 18:37:45] <kane1941> How come it didnt simulate to Self-Aware over night?
[2023-01-07 18:37:48] <Daanaas> ok
[2023-01-07 18:37:48] <%+Purecrew> I think its not enough resonant ender
[2023-01-07 18:37:49] <+TheRackster> So for this modpack what is the best power gen starting early? Cus power gen is the thing that infuriates me the most in modpacks
[2023-01-07 18:37:54] <AleXanDreMau> @Giantwaffle can you upgrade the % of sucess ?

[2023-01-07 18:38:33] <banutzul> ender pearls are not fast enough

[2023-01-07 18:38:36] <Daryl_Kay> Yeah dont think you were making enough ender pearls
[2023-01-07 18:38:38] <%Aivarm> stop exporting to ME those pearls atm
[2023-01-07 18:38:44] <RefiixGaming> The problem is machines are producing till they are full
[2023-01-07 18:38:45] <%+lvyEartman> so you are not making enough pearls?
[2023-01-07 18:38:52] <%DaemonSzyman> Maybe the 6 to 1 ratio was incorrect?
[2023-01-07 18:38:56] <Koristbuh> doesn't the multi smelter have a 32stack buffer it needs to build up too?

[2023-01-07 18:39:07] <niborkees> the 5% in the begin phase was too low
[2023-01-07 18:39:13] <%Nickonil> is the machine connected to some sort of storage tanks?

[2023-01-07 18:39:44] <%aundros> try just making more enderpearls?

[2023-01-07 18:49:23] <KnightofObv> So a few drawer upgrades to start a buffer for when you plug in the others
[2023-01-07 18:49:29] <Bulltank> its a feature chat, not a bug Kappa
[2023-01-07 18:49:33] <+dcjrracing11> Limit the others instead of the Ender and diamond ones.
[2023-01-07 18:49:33] <+Face_32> this modpack could mess iwth round robin working or not
[2023-01-07 18:49:38] <$kbigLiar> does distance affect priorities? so is 2 even enough for the end of the enderman line vs the start of the diamond line?
[2023-01-07 18:49:39] <%+leeroy_47> side-quest time
[2023-01-07 18:49:45] <%LsTheRoberto> You should store at least 143 stacks of the clay so each machine can be fed
[2023-01-07 18:49:47] <InternetPlumber> just game it out
[2023-01-07 18:49:58] <matori666> that's a good idea, limit all except the enderman ones @giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:50:00] <%Winstonrocks> if the item conduit cant pull enough out to do it without round robin make another draw and have two outputs into the sim chambers
[2023-01-07 18:50:06] <Vovosunt> need multiple with same prio too
[2023-01-07 18:50:10] <%GuardMoony> Seems there are bug reports about this on github

[2023-01-07 18:50:43] <+Face_32> or intentional in this modpack
[2023-01-07 18:50:43] <ThuhMonty> Yep round robin was indeed the issue
[2023-01-07 18:50:45] <%$frainsbreeze> SCIENCE BITCH!
[2023-01-07 18:50:48] <%LsTheRoberto> well at least now you know
[2023-01-07 18:50:50] <%xaviermanifest> oh damn u right
[2023-01-07 18:50:54] <%LsTheRoberto> you had a few things set to round robin
[2023-01-07 18:50:55] <niborkees> figured it out
[2023-01-07 18:50:57] <Naappletree> good intuition
[2023-01-07 18:50:58] VIEWERS: 1¬†751
[2023-01-07 18:51:01] <Daryl_Kay> Yeah priority to a drawer adn then round robin on the row
[2023-01-07 18:51:01] <Vovosunt> @Giantwaffle will one extract be enough for the whole system?
[2023-01-07 18:51:02] <%DX_Plates> RR probably uses prio to do RR
[2023-01-07 18:51:02] <%0sem0> debugged!
[2023-01-07 18:51:05] <deadgolfer> time to turn off all the round robins there
[2023-01-07 18:51:13] <xAndreasDam> Does it do round robin on the "inserts" on the same priority level?
[2023-01-07 18:51:17] <%+Traverus98> now that you know you should be able to plug everything back in
[2023-01-07 18:51:17] <Bulltank> Once the system is full its full. Round Robin wont matter
[2023-01-07 18:51:17] <+IlsaGold> I guess the issue has been found
[2023-01-07 18:51:17] <Bernd135> Try more outputs with the same priority
[2023-01-07 18:51:18] <flamingblaster> you could build buffers
[2023-01-07 18:51:20] <arkun_> *shakes fist at past Waffle*
[2023-01-07 18:51:21] <%GuardMoony> Then we will need to fix item creation also
[2023-01-07 18:51:23] <Vovosunt> @Giantwaffle make mini-buffers for each line and round robin out?
[2023-01-07 18:51:27] <lukasalbert> i think someone in chat even said that yesterday
[2023-01-07 18:51:28] <flamingblaster> and then round robin from there
[2023-01-07 18:51:28] <%+Traverus98> probably want to turn off round robin on pristine extract to
[2023-01-07 18:51:33] <kaasrondje> Surely
[2023-01-07 18:51:34] <%BilusTheTiny> So you need two system/network if you want to use priority / round robin
[2023-01-07 18:51:35] <%0sem0> should COPIUM
[2023-01-07 18:51:37] <ThuhMonty> Should COPIUM
[2023-01-07 18:51:38] <%mechoriet> buffers == delaying issues like in factorio
[2023-01-07 18:51:43] <%CubicJazz> if your production is more than your usage, round robin isnt really needed anyways
[2023-01-07 18:51:45] <Naappletree> yep Copium

[2023-01-07 18:52:34] <%LsTheRoberto> its not even worth the time to try and use it
[2023-01-07 18:52:34] <%$frainsbreeze> round robin should be switched on for the pristine matter
[2023-01-07 18:52:37] <%Aivarm> on pristine you want RR enabled as you have different ones
[2023-01-07 18:52:59] VIEWERS: 1¬†751
[2023-01-07 18:53:01] <deadgolfer> bottom of ender loot fabricators
[2023-01-07 18:53:07] <%GuardMoony> but pristine also got prio for ender pearl and diamonds
[2023-01-07 18:53:07] <%+usernameNull> round Robin doesn't work if it goes out faster than you generate it
[2023-01-07 18:53:08] <niborkees> no because the ender pearl priority is higher
[2023-01-07 18:53:09] <+IlsaGold> Do we have things stored to start it?
[2023-01-07 18:53:16] <InternetPlumber> it won't matter as it will just back up the closer machines first
[2023-01-07 18:53:16] <%+podwe> Did u watch RRR in full yet? waffleLUL
[2023-01-07 18:53:19] <+CoolAcid> Wow, Wiki says one thing, EnderIO github issue 1130 says it does what you just scienced. Documentation sux :(
[2023-01-07 18:53:23] <Vovosunt> there's no way 1 extractor conduit will be able to handle so many target inventories
[2023-01-07 18:53:23] <InternetPlumber> eventually they will all back up
[2023-01-07 18:53:29] <%+DecertoJonesy> make 2 extracts?
[2023-01-07 18:53:29] <%LsTheRoberto> things will back up eventually in the machine, dont need round robin
[2023-01-07 18:53:31] <matori666> just item limit it to 4
[2023-01-07 18:53:31] <+Slowkill333> put a buffer chest to priority into and then round robin out of the buffer for the sub sections.
[2023-01-07 18:53:32] <The_Holas> @Giantwaffle Did you watched RRR? PauseChamp
[2023-01-07 18:53:34] <%Aivarm> another closed loop for only ender pearls then
[2023-01-07 18:53:34] <Bernd135> Ideally you need to extract each pristine indivuallity from their drawer with round roubin enable
[2023-01-07 18:53:36] <%GuardMoony> we could seperate the output of the ender/diamond and the other ones
[2023-01-07 18:53:39] <+chipsdrengen> Nothing else matters
[2023-01-07 18:53:42] <%Bunjimus> wonder if thats why your enderpearls were running out
[2023-01-07 18:53:49] <deadgolfer> bottom of ender pearls loot fabs?
[2023-01-07 18:53:50] <her0zer0> I guess that could have brown it too. if you use ender matter for other things
[2023-01-07 18:53:51] <%Aivarm> or add chest for ender pearl generation
[2023-01-07 18:53:56] <%TheIrishGuy> are you DML crafting enderpears fast enough ? @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:53:57] <+BitterPL> yea round robin will make it break if out of clay in places where priority is important
[2023-01-07 18:54:01] <%Aivarm> for buffer
[2023-01-07 18:54:01] <her0zer0> broken*
[2023-01-07 18:54:10] <ThuhMonty> Damn so it is a documented issue but only on GitHub m, not wiki
[2023-01-07 18:54:12] <+FowD8> use gregtech pipes and it'll fill faster than EnderIO conduits (i think?) @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-07 18:54:13] <%TheIrishGuy> not that one the other side
[2023-01-07 18:54:16] <%+Traverus98> how many diamonds did you burn since you weren't making any overnight haha
[2023-01-07 18:54:20] <+Face_32> just turn on mobs spawning and go to the end and make a vanilla ender farm
[2023-01-07 18:54:30] <+ns0z> Could downgrade drawers for stuff you dont need 1000s of and make it like 2-4 stacks
[2023-01-07 18:54:30] <Shoobinist> you were also making enderman heads cause of round robin
[2023-01-07 18:54:30] <KnightofObv> you need around 10.5k polymer clay stored to fill up all of those DML's
[2023-01-07 18:54:41] <%gartoks> 5 more, right? 1 Enderman + 5 additional
[2023-01-07 18:54:52] <+MrSilverMatch> Time to reconnect everything
[2023-01-07 18:54:53] <deadgolfer> round robin out of your ender pearl loot fabs could be messing with your priority system and dumping them into your ME instead
[2023-01-07 18:54:57] <%GuardMoony> Could add more ender dml's :D

[2023-01-07 18:55:32] <%xaviermanifest> no do ittttt
[2023-01-07 18:55:32] <+Xxxneogeoxxx> Were the enderman head the issue? 1/3 the pristine matter was going to heads
[2023-01-07 18:55:32] <+Blazedude99> doesn't it take a ton of simulation chambers to back up a loot fabricator? wouldnt that causse a problem with 1 thermal sim and 3 thermal loots

[2023-01-07 19:05:57] <Shoobinist> you can filter the loot chambers
[2023-01-07 19:06:04] <%DarkKnghtt58> it's mainly just enderpearls though

[2023-01-07 19:08:10] <%Aivarm> well for now atleats youre generating 1 enderpeal with machine.. if you RR that with chest youll have 2 machines running for jumpstart etc
[2023-01-07 19:08:29] <%+Purecrew> Based on your calculations you need both of those to be making enderpearls or the system will fail again
[2023-01-07 19:08:31] <+psycho917> you only need to do it times
[2023-01-07 19:08:44] <kakiewakie_> still fixing this?

[2023-01-07 19:08:59] <flamingblaster> i wold just pu a chest or a drawer above the row and then round robin from there
[2023-01-07 19:09:03] <%mechoriet> well a cache with only one stack allowed of the ender pearl matter thing and rr from that cache
[2023-01-07 19:09:05] <matori666> you can prioritize to the chest and then RR
[2023-01-07 19:09:06] VIEWERS: 2¬†054
[2023-01-07 19:09:06] <Kunja> you could just priotise into a chest above the enter pearls and then just do that row round robin into those machines

[2023-01-07 19:09:12] <suitedtiger123> cant you round robin the inserts for the enderpearl?

[2023-01-07 19:10:18] <lukasalbert> yeah

[2023-01-07 19:10:24] <%LsTheRoberto> Just filter the 2 enderman

[2023-01-07 19:17:34] <%+boyownik> What is the speed of your export conduit? Because on default I believe it is 3 so when round robin is enabled 3 items is put in each chest iwth same prio
[2023-01-07 19:17:53] <navalship55> Alright, thank you
[2023-01-07 19:18:01] <her0zer0> unless you wait for pearl backup you need a total of 39 self aware enderman sim to overwhelm those crafter
[2023-01-07 19:18:13] <%+Angel0death> What about having a buffer chest in between each line with a priority instead?
[2023-01-07 19:18:14] <%GuardMoony> only way to fix it so you ensure items and pearls are created is to split the pristine generation in 2 seperate systems. ( first 3 rows on 1 drawer system ) and the others on a other
[2023-01-07 19:18:27] <%$frainsbreeze> waffle your friendly minecraft scientist!
[2023-01-07 19:18:28] <NinjaMaster__> you could priroity to buffer chests then round robbin off them
[2023-01-07 19:18:29] <%cheppard> shouldn't it fix itself anyway?
[2023-01-07 19:18:33] <%Aivarm> seems like priority stu central and gen-s and RR after that from separate storages
[2023-01-07 19:18:34] <RefiixGaming> 143
[2023-01-07 19:18:42] <RefiixGaming> as in all
[2023-01-07 19:18:45] <%+TheGeekPeek> Just use a buffer chest with priority, once the first fills it will move to the second section and so on.
[2023-01-07 19:18:48] <RefiixGaming> so 113 is the rest

[2023-01-07 19:42:30] <McSauce> Google searches have gone downhill for yeeeeaaars.

[2023-01-07 22:07:08] <highly_addicted> Cant you use a redstone output on the drawers, if the manganese drawer isnt full it sends a drone?
[2023-01-07 22:07:13] <Madarion> Time for a Paint work sheet Kappa
[2023-01-07 22:07:15] <+redbeardjedd> Create your own crafting recipe that is one microminer that returns x amount of ore. Then when your system need an ore it will craft a miner and return the materials you want.
[2023-01-07 22:07:21] <coolcake2> clock is typicaly the worst way of doing such automation
[2023-01-07 22:07:35] <coolcake2> ah ok
[2023-01-07 22:07:35] <Minelmonia> why not send back to back? i missed that
[2023-01-07 22:07:41] <+IlsaGold> Would be cool to trigger the drone based on storage quantity
[2023-01-07 22:07:58] <Intohimos> You're probably thinking too much about it. You should try and automate drones first and then you can figure out how often you want to send them

[2023-01-07 22:53:54] <+Koeckie> @orangecreamsicle3 ... I know, but in the pattern was stainless steel something and silver wire and endsteel wire I think i don't know, just guessing
[2023-01-07 22:53:58] <Rtonne> i saw the polarizer turn on for a sec when you went there
[2023-01-07 22:54:00] <drsnaki96> check the machine buffer for hv pistons, arms and circuits

[2023-01-07 22:56:18] <Sulheim> I think Rods were filling buffers for the crafts that use them
[2023-01-07 22:56:23] <KnightofObv> you used 2 HV pumps, so it had to remake them, it used alot of stainless for that, after this it started on the rods again
