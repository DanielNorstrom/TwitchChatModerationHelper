Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

[2022-12-20 06:30:03] <%Zenonoke> for a rougue it makes sense
[2022-12-20 06:30:10] <shakerofmilks> It's a very noticeable difference when you have a heavy weapon equiped

[2022-12-20 07:59:39] <ZergistheWord> @Ceremor turn and run, faster then backpedling
[2022-12-20 07:59:41] <%+Enseladus> first attack definitely feels faster
[2022-12-20 07:59:58] <Oratha95> @enseladus pretty much. One is the bleed. One does a hit and reduces armor. Poison blade is good with the bleed because you just go ham. I went 10 steps. Then I went poison blade. Then the backstab. I think I’m lvl 13 rn as rogue.
[2022-12-20 08:00:04] <%+Desert_Navy> Mimic is easier than skeleton to kill and often has a good weapon you can use

[2022-12-20 08:01:27] <crazyhomelessman> depends on your weapon
[2022-12-20 08:01:31] <Oratha95> @enseladus I think my ranger is 12. Make sure your q is the quick shot. And check in with the merchant that sells longbows sometimes. If you can find one he has above 40 dmg you will be doing pretty good.
[2022-12-20 08:01:49] <%+Enseladus> @Oratha95 the triple shot is busted

[2022-12-20 08:03:12] <Oratha95> And it’s just a bad time for the em @enseladus
[2022-12-20 08:03:15] <+BloodSeeker8> if you croush wall spikes dont hit u
[2022-12-20 08:03:19] <%+Enseladus> @Oratha95 i like barbarian because i can smash through doors
[2022-12-20 08:03:22] <+BloodSeeker8> crouch*
[2022-12-20 08:03:26] <%+Enseladus> makes chasing super easy
[2022-12-20 08:03:58] <Oratha95> @enseladus I haven’t played him. But if you step on a trap you have to look and disarm it to be able to move. You’re literally stuck in place. Free triple shot

[2022-12-20 08:39:53] <@%+Chaosshield> stiletto is still worse than rondel, it doesn't stab as far

[2022-12-20 08:44:02] <@%+Chaosshield> Ambush can be good but it is only one attack, and that assumes you aren't using hide+stealth for a flank
[2022-12-20 08:44:27] <@%+Chaosshield> 2 stabs from the back immediately outclasses ambush

[2022-12-20 09:55:42] <%CornyPoop> high roller is mega rough as solo
[2022-12-20 09:55:52] <yournansbowl> you want some better weapons before you go in there, mobs are harder
[2022-12-20 09:56:00] <%+raganook> not for a god gamer like ceremor
[2022-12-20 09:56:02] <@%+Chaosshield> yeah the PVE is harder in high roller
[2022-12-20 09:56:08] <@%+Chaosshield> you pretty much need a ranger or wizard
[2022-12-20 09:56:25] <@%+Chaosshield> if you plan to go down a floor

[2022-12-20 09:57:41] <namorsei> if you could modify sell amount all would be good
[2022-12-20 09:57:49] <namorsei> for me at least
[2022-12-20 09:57:52] <yournansbowl> silver coins id say arer worthless atm, hopefully the add a use or make conversion a little better
[2022-12-20 09:58:12] <namorsei> silver for goblin merchant would be cool
[2022-12-20 09:58:30] <+cr4zylegz187> is ranger all range or are there handhelds they can use too?

[2022-12-20 10:29:27] <BigBudB> crouching is amazing
[2022-12-20 10:29:35] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> try ranger at some point, you can do some clever stuff with the traps
[2022-12-20 10:29:36] <BigBudB> people always aim head
[2022-12-20 10:29:38] <crazyhomelessman> you can duck and look up to move your head out of the way
[2022-12-20 10:29:46] <crazyhomelessman> matrix dodge
[2022-12-20 10:29:46] <wfthkttn> not if you push your back to the wall tho
[2022-12-20 10:29:49] <BigBudB> second attack on cleric mace is horizontalish
[2022-12-20 10:29:50] <%+LividCreature> a lot of 2 people groups
[2022-12-20 10:30:12] <namorsei> using shields in this game is so satisfying
[2022-12-20 10:30:25] <BigBudB> always stab the legs of the shield mans
[2022-12-20 10:30:32] <BigBudB> they panic so hard

[2022-12-20 10:33:55] <%+LividCreature> @Chaosshield gotcha
[2022-12-20 10:34:15] <BigBudB> the crosshair is an approximation depending on weapon swings
[2022-12-20 10:34:19] <crazyhomelessman> because it's the animation that counts, no thte crosshair
[2022-12-20 10:34:39] <BigBudB> yeah exactly crazy

[2022-12-20 11:23:25] <sonamagz> will they add in game quests/challenges down the line too?
[2022-12-20 11:23:35] <strugglesnuggler> you need a pick
[2022-12-20 11:23:35] <stahnn2> Also like Tarkov, vertical audio

[2022-12-20 11:23:56] <strugglesnuggler> with like 500 ore you can make a really good kit
[2022-12-20 11:24:07] <sonamagz> run
[2022-12-20 11:24:10] <yournansbowl> Run
[2022-12-20 11:24:17] <OldMan_Birch> @ceremor you need a pickaxe for the ore
[2022-12-20 11:24:26] <catzcatz> stab him with the pinty end

[2022-12-20 11:26:22] <strugglesnuggler> thrill ride
[2022-12-20 11:26:26] <stahnn2> Red portals to down
[2022-12-20 11:26:32] <%Psychoactivehaze> oh cool
[2022-12-20 11:26:39] <%+AscendantEdge> it takes you to boss land
[2022-12-20 11:26:48] <OldMan_Birch> Red takes you to HELL
[2022-12-20 11:26:59] <stahnn2> The 1st level in the play test is the hard level
[2022-12-20 11:27:00] <strugglesnuggler> there are not that many players that utilize the down portals
[2022-12-20 11:27:03] <%+AscendantEdge> if you were geared to fucking full purp or blue maybe you could do it
[2022-12-20 11:27:12] <yournansbowl> High roller is possible solo, red chamber im not sure yet. Maybe with all purples, but just the doggos one shot you
[2022-12-20 11:27:17] <%just_call_me_proddy> Inventory is reminiscent of Kingdom Come Deliverance

[2022-12-20 11:27:59] <OldMan_Birch> @ceremor have you tried any of the other classes?
[2022-12-20 11:28:31] <%Mister_Krill> yes
[2022-12-20 11:28:34] <theratscuadleader> yes you can
[2022-12-20 11:28:35] <jeems__> last playtest it was
[2022-12-20 11:28:36] <%Mister_Krill> just rare
[2022-12-20 11:28:36] <OldMan_Birch> Rogue is definitely one of the better ones to play.
[2022-12-20 11:28:38] <littleboriz> it's possible but rare
[2022-12-20 11:28:39] <@%+Chaosshield> yes you can get purps from wraiths/gold/lion chests
[2022-12-20 11:28:39] <theratscuadleader> legend also
[2022-12-20 11:28:39] <%+AscendantEdge> anything is possible
[2022-12-20 11:28:44] <%Witch_Hats> The elites are what make it more common pretty sure
[2022-12-20 11:28:51] <strugglesnuggler> i think purple on boss in lower level but cannot fine legenday or uniqe unless in high roller
[2022-12-20 11:29:14] <theratscuadleader> my mate found a lengenday stileto on normal hell
[2022-12-20 11:29:25] <OldMan_Birch> Just pick up all the candy canes and go to Santa.
[2022-12-20 11:29:27] <littleboriz> also, spell damage items boosts your poison dmg ceremor
[2022-12-20 11:29:27] <%Mister_Krill> yeah if far walk one direction then before they shoot walk the other

[2022-12-20 11:31:08] <Krylic_> you can sell em
[2022-12-20 11:31:16] <+nevergetkot> white ones sell for shit
[2022-12-20 11:31:21] <OldMan_Birch> @ceremor do you plan to play when tarkov wipes?
[2022-12-20 11:31:30] <strugglesnuggler> i thought rogues had lockpicking ability
[2022-12-20 11:31:44] <Krylic_> its a perk ^
[2022-12-20 11:31:47] <OldMan_Birch> @strugglesnuggler certain locks are harder and still need them.
[2022-12-20 11:31:47] VIEWERS: 383
[2022-12-20 11:31:49] <strugglesnuggler> ah ok
[2022-12-20 11:32:02] <OldMan_Birch> Also what @krylic_ said.
[2022-12-20 11:32:03] <kriegfleisch> spell capacity looks like it increases memory, which i am assuming is how many spells you can have
[2022-12-20 11:32:09] <%+LividCreature> Is it the closer you get to the small circle do the PVE enemies get harder?
[2022-12-20 11:32:21] <spikeygeorge> Do different armour types make you louder?
[2022-12-20 11:32:43] <%Witch_Hats> slappy feet, clanky boots
[2022-12-20 11:32:45] <%+AscendantEdge> i have to say i am enjoying watching you solo this
[2022-12-20 11:32:45] <Krylic_> yeah the heavier boots seem to be louder
[2022-12-20 11:32:46] <spikeygeorge> sweet! good to know! gonna try this later :D
[2022-12-20 11:32:46] <strugglesnuggler> @LividCreature no but more likely to run into groups
[2022-12-20 11:32:48] <@%+Chaosshield> yeah you can tell if someone has plate/leather/barefoot
[2022-12-20 11:32:50] <strugglesnuggler> of players
[2022-12-20 11:32:51] <@%+Chaosshield> based on footsteps
[2022-12-20 11:33:08] <@%+Chaosshield> good way to tell if someone is geared or not is to listen for barefeet
[2022-12-20 11:33:10] <@%+Chaosshield> since no class starts with boots
[2022-12-20 11:33:32] <%+AscendantEdge> how accurate is sound in this game>?
[2022-12-20 11:33:43] <spikeygeorge> Chaos, is it worth just going in naked each run for a few then? :D
