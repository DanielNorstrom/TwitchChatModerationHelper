[2023-01-05 07:10:11] <+kurikaivt> @cherrimode I'm so glad that you're getting the help you need! I just got my diagnosis with autism as an adult so I'm here to support you as you go through this!
[2023-01-05 07:10:11] <@%sesamefig> @kurikaivt aww thank you! I am trying to make a project out of my plants and other things.. will let you all know later :)
[2023-01-05 07:10:37] <TechyOracle> Neurodivergent people need resources and systems to adapt to how society is run, and official diagnosis help so much with that.

[2023-01-05 07:10:44] <+kurikaivt> @sesamefig I'm so excited! I love seeing all the plants post, I just started growing more in my garden so it makes me happy seeing the plant love

[2023-01-05 07:55:28] <+LittleGirlPlays> theres a cool abandoned rice mill in my town and i wanna take a drown and fly it through the whole building
[2023-01-05 07:55:30] <TechyOracle> I remember this one urban exploration video of an entire abandoned city in China. Incredibly fascinating.

[2023-01-05 07:56:46] <+LittleGirlPlays> plus ill get to practice flying an fpv drone ~
[2023-01-05 07:57:16] <jwswamp> what's a liminal space?
[2023-01-05 07:57:17] <wayne1566> hmmmm, if y'all ever come down to Oklahoma let me know and I'll take y'all down to my bottle spot, there's no trespassing signs, and the police know me so incase anything happens
[2023-01-05 07:57:24] <+LittleGirlPlays> ive also been seeing a few of those fpv rc car videos too and those are pretty cool
[2023-01-05 07:57:25] <@%sesamefig> Ikr @cherrimode ?! 😓 dad and I are so different. He took me to a psychological horror movie once, he was laughing at how silly the storyline was

[2023-01-05 07:57:41] <+LittleGirlPlays> but rc cars would be too dififcult where i live due to the terrain, so i think a drone would be a better fit
[2023-01-05 07:58:13] <cherrimode> @sesamefig oh no, I'm so sorry. I hate horror films

[2023-01-05 07:58:42] <+LittleGirlPlays> a liminal space is like a place that exists in  transience. places  that dont have permanent residence, but do see people
[2023-01-05 07:58:45] <+LittleGirlPlays> airports are a good example
[2023-01-05 07:58:50] <@%sesamefig> It’s usually poorly lit or lit with dark areas, usually makes you uneasy and a bit uncomfortable.
[2023-01-05 07:58:55] <jwswamp> @cherrimode I hated horror until I got on anxiety medicine
[2023-01-05 07:59:12] <Im2Unstable> Hey Dad!
[2023-01-05 07:59:20] <cherrimode> to me liminal spaces escipally indoor remind me of nightmare I've had as a childhood
[2023-01-05 07:59:21] <@%sesamefig> Honestly I think the backrooms are a good example of that.
[2023-01-05 07:59:21] <wayne1566> now I don't wanna say where I'm from but we do got a USS ship named after my home town
