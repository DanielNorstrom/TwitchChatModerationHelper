[2022-12-06 06:45:59] <%TwogBee> NZ has very diverse climates because it's an island. It doesn't get as bad as Aus but in parts of the country it can be pretty unbareable at times
[2022-12-06 06:47:28] <%TwogBee> kyokSuffer and with a thin ozone layer over NZ the sun is way more intense. Skin cancer is a real issue here
[2022-12-06 06:53:26] <%AdmiralShepard_> Damn thats crazy, i dont envy you guys
[2022-12-06 06:54:08] <%TwogBee> it could be worse, at least its not a desert

[2022-12-06 12:40:02] <RavagedPistol> probably the encoder
[2022-12-06 12:40:03] <%blossom__dance> it was stuttering yesterday but I only noticed it in a cutscene

[2022-12-06 12:41:07] <%Darklobi> do u see what we see?
[2022-12-06 12:41:11] <%TRiCK_NiNE> CPU might still be getting overloaded on certain cores

[2022-12-06 12:43:37] <%shewtrr> yea i thought nvenc was the standard
[2022-12-06 12:43:39] <%neonfusion> what gpu does kyo have?
[2022-12-06 12:43:39] <%TRiCK_NiNE> it uses separate hardware on the GPU for encode
[2022-12-06 12:43:41] <%uSei_> nvenc is good, it uses a different part of the gpu
[2022-12-06 12:43:41] <%blossom__dance> during Overwatch maybe xdd

[2022-12-06 12:44:01] <@%ValhalIen> Depends on what you're doing
[2022-12-06 12:44:10] <%Merk7> gpu tends to be because it has the dedicated chip just for that right
[2022-12-06 12:44:14] <%TRiCK_NiNE> unless you're pushing visual quality, nvenc is generally better for most situations
