[2022-12-08 16:55:09] <%+REVerend814> did 2018 make you do the repeating of challenges to unlock the next one? That aspect of this one really wore on me after a while. so repetitive

[2022-12-08 17:08:47] <k4ge__> @JonFrankel exactly opposite for me

[2022-12-08 17:09:19] <+JonFrankel> @k4ge__ might just say screw it and lower the difficulty LUL
[2022-12-08 17:09:27] <%+Wholemane> The mention of wasp just randomly reminded me of the metal band. "If you FUCK like a beast, you're an animal!"
[2022-12-08 17:09:32] <%AbstractPlay> tough to imagine a GoW game w/o Blades of Chaos combat
[2022-12-08 17:09:35] <@%Lorg> @JonFrankel I dropped my difficulty to Normal/balanced
[2022-12-08 17:09:42] <@%Lorg> I don't have the patience for this stuff
[2022-12-08 17:09:49] <%AbstractPlay> but tough to imagine any character but Kratos wielding BoC
[2022-12-08 17:09:58] <+JonFrankel> @Lorg That's the difficulty I'm at now haha. Maybe I'm just bad lol
[2022-12-08 17:09:59] <+Zindurn> Thats why difficulty sliders exist innit Lorg
[2022-12-08 17:10:10] <@%Lorg> I mean, I love Souls games

[2022-12-08 17:11:09] <%pirateidealist> I play this game on GMGOW because I have OCPD
[2022-12-08 17:11:33] <k4ge__> @JonFrankel oh, no shame in that :)
[2022-12-08 17:11:53] <n_three> I have a feeling these trials were made only when the devs were in a bad mood
[2022-12-08 17:11:54] <Patton2410> I played on No Mercy. Wasnt ready to put my self GMGOW diff, i dnt hate my self that much LUL
[2022-12-08 17:12:12] <%+J_Bo_> I think souls combat had kind of ruined other melee games for me. nothing else is even close imo.
[2022-12-08 17:12:18] <%pirateidealist> nightmares have honestly killed me more than any other enemy type not counting bosses
[2022-12-08 17:12:25] VIEWERS: 789
[2022-12-08 17:12:49] <%pirateidealist> @J_Bo_ I am kind of in the opposite bag. I am so burned out on Souls that this game feels really refreshing
[2022-12-08 17:12:59] <%+J_Bo_> I can see that
[2022-12-08 17:13:11] <SeckSymbols> This was my least favorite challenge LUL
[2022-12-08 17:13:12] <Slickm0ve> I kinda just like how god of war made you feel like you have to use every button on the control
[2022-12-08 17:13:18] <+JonFrankel> In a game that's otherwise so respectful of the player's time, making you redo two trials to unlock a new trial is so bizarre

[2022-12-08 17:45:37] <@%Lorg> Yeah, it's probably the best game I've ever played.
[2022-12-08 17:45:40] <@%Lorg> I'll just put that out there.
[2022-12-08 17:45:47] <@%Majeye> For those that play Valheim, they finally came out with their Mistlands DLC/update
[2022-12-08 17:45:50] <@%Lorg> So, getting Hades for like 12 bucks is a steal
[2022-12-08 17:45:50] <%Breezaholic> That hit of full nicotine Noita really hits better than the 8-Ball of Crack this game demands

[2022-12-08 17:47:05] <+ArdentAdamTV> i got Noita for just under £11 after watching you play it, seemed like it was up my street i like Dead Cells and Hades a lot
[2022-12-08 17:47:17] <%+MeroeShasta> @Lorg It was cool playing it while it was in early access too, the story kind of evolved with the game in a cool way
[2022-12-08 17:47:31] <@%Lorg> @Knives112 Yeah
[2022-12-08 17:47:45] <@%Lorg> @MeroeShasta I bought it early access, but waited for it to ship 1.0

[2022-12-08 17:49:30] <+Renny00> has anyone played forbidden west? is it worth trying? I liked zero dawn for the gameplay but wasn't super interested in the story. Thoughts?
[2022-12-08 17:49:56] <NickonJTV> Forbidden West is basically better than Zero Dawn in every way
[2022-12-08 17:50:03] <%happyskeret> Oh gee
[2022-12-08 17:50:09] <BlindExecution> Strap in...
[2022-12-08 17:50:12] <%jeanlemaingre> I've seen people play forbidden west but never played it, it seems like an enjoyable game to play just not my type of game
[2022-12-08 17:50:13] <%vixtlan> @Renny00 yes definately play it
[2022-12-08 17:50:19] <%AbstractPlay> MAN is too moderately leveled to be doing this frankly. Either under-level for the challenge or over-level and get it over with already Kappa
[2022-12-08 17:50:21] <%vixtlan> im gonna plat west

[2022-12-08 17:50:56] <NickonJTV> Forbidden West is better than Elden Ring, that's my hot take about that LUL
[2022-12-08 17:50:57] <%+blurTTV> i don't either, not even sure which came out first without looking it up
[2022-12-08 17:51:07] <@%Knives112> he was riffing on my comment about you being too over leveled
[2022-12-08 17:51:11] <%vixtlan> @Renny00 gameplay also better, new weapons, stuff i wont spoil, amazing moments, skill trees
[2022-12-08 17:51:14] <@%Knives112> cant one just be...leveled?

[2022-12-08 17:51:56] <%AbstractPlay> people dislike Aloy?
[2022-12-08 17:52:01] <NickonJTV> Because weirdos think she wasn't hot enough for them
[2022-12-08 17:52:08] <+Mecha_G> those kind of people do

[2022-12-08 17:52:27] <%Breezaholic> Until Forbidden West she was a boring character that didnt really have any character growth until the final few minutes.

[2022-12-08 17:53:19] <+Renny00> @Breezaholic I kind of agree, I thought the dialogue was too lengthy and boring

[2022-12-08 17:53:27] <%Breezaholic> She was better in Forbidden West, but honestly i hated how she was still this "i can do this all on my own, i dont need these other people at my base, even though i have specifically recruited them there to help me"

[2022-12-08 18:07:28] <@%Majeye> but the word "they" in "if you build it they will come" is incorrect

[2022-12-08 19:24:11] <viewer_n6> Rock is whatever, but no more Cavill would be a huge mistake like with Witcher

[2022-12-08 20:02:17] <get_the_mail> @AbstractPlay I would argue that there is virtually no downside to remakes and remasters, unlike films, which are re-hashed out of lack of ideas, games are re-made out of technical necessity. games are a product of their time, and the hardware available, where movies have been made the same way for 100 years.

[2022-12-08 20:30:22] <%Zerotan> I smell it in the air, I feel it in the water
[2022-12-08 20:30:29] <%AbstractPlay> those 4 bars are probably only about 20% though. the health doesn't reduce linearly.
[2022-12-08 20:30:42] <%Yogitus> Her character model is pretty damn awesome
[2022-12-08 20:30:54] <+JonFrankel> Love it when Mimir tells you to use your shield. Thanks bud, didn't know that
