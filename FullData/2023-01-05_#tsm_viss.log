[2023-01-05 16:12:04] <signalfive> You have to give him credit viss.
[2023-01-05 16:12:21] <darkside_dad> the riot shield should be a 2 handed carry, no pistol, no throwing. if you want to throw you have to put it away
[2023-01-05 16:12:24] <signalfive> He used a tactic just like you
[2023-01-05 16:12:25] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @cozyturtle52 omfg did he actually just get flashed and riot shielded

[2023-01-05 16:12:45] <%gamerPadge> Crap way to win a game, but it did win
[2023-01-05 16:12:47] <%jbeepz> he shoulda had balls and tried to beat you with the shield
[2023-01-05 16:12:53] <%vincenttoki> but like you said theres launchers to shoot his heli down
[2023-01-05 16:12:54] <paddy988> you would have to have semtex or thermite as your grenade and land a good throw
[2023-01-05 16:12:55] <%gamerPadge> that person likely hates themselves
[2023-01-05 16:12:57] <signalfive> No.

[2023-01-05 16:13:13] <%Shifferz> Riot shield should either be fully removed or only take so much damage.
[2023-01-05 16:13:13] <%RedShadowHTX> @TSM_Viss don't forget to make every loadout a riot shield for good measure
[2023-01-05 16:13:14] <%+Stygg3> he broke the game

[2023-01-05 16:14:24] <millertime6249> I think we neeed to just have a sniping game once lol good stress reliever
[2023-01-05 16:14:24] <%gamerPadge> Watch viss do it and get like a 18 kill game
[2023-01-05 16:14:25] <+trollestcoaster> I don't even think the heli is the problem, it's that he had 8 flashbangs... 1 flash is stupid enough since you can't even look away from them, 8 or however many he had is just ridiculous
[2023-01-05 16:14:33] <%+nexusxxiii> not much different from the people that complain about Viss using the ATV. There are items in game to counter the shield and make it irrelevant.
[2023-01-05 16:14:33] <%+Kreeped> lol
[2023-01-05 16:14:34] <+Endlessdecline> I thought ride and shine were his squad at first
[2023-01-05 16:14:40] <%+Kreeped> yeah he would do it and drop a 20 bomb with it

[2023-01-05 16:15:25] <%RedShadowHTX> @trollestcoaster if they wouldn't let you stow everything and only use the designated slots with the set amounts per slots for revives masks nades etc. It would be so much better.
[2023-01-05 16:15:50] <signalfive> @redshadowhtx No
[2023-01-05 16:15:52] <%vgb3> does a semtex grenade deal with Riot shield?

[2023-01-05 16:26:01] <%+tehfintal> @JtotheDizzle I think they should add a mechanic to it where squads can assist the champion as well. that way it pits players against one another. some trying to stop it, some trying to help.  Maybe reward a stricker or icons for "assisted with" or " helped prevent"
[2023-01-05 16:26:07] <MelMan2002> we gonna try for a single kill win?
[2023-01-05 16:26:15] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @god_ragnarson Viss was wondering if theres even counterplay to that so hes tryin it
[2023-01-05 16:26:24] <paddy988> i swear if I tried to do this I would be getting beamed while trying to refuel lol
[2023-01-05 16:26:37] <signalfive> Yup. I think it will rival  the run around in an LTV strategy.
[2023-01-05 16:26:58] <%vincenttoki> i think you can stow the flashes in the backpack, and keep suppling more with the perk @TSM_Viss

[2023-01-05 16:27:56] <%JtotheDizzle> Riot shield, throwing knife, flash/smoke in solos with a 3 plate and self is an annoying build that has a high win rate for sure.
[2023-01-05 16:28:12] <%+tehfintal> @JtotheDizzle i think the champ quest is slightly too difficult. Sense it's so damn hard to even get a go at it, than you gotta basically fight the whole server while debuffed. Like i get it, it's a special thing. But it's like Darksouls hard
[2023-01-05 16:28:48] <signalfive> @hauntedpistachio Semtex or Thermite
[2023-01-05 16:29:04] <%JtotheDizzle> @tehfintal 100%, and I know the argument is there that there are players that do it routinely. But thats like the top 1% or less of players lol.

[2023-01-05 17:00:50] <%jeffyjj33> Yeah, I'd never spend $200 on a controller. I just stole my roommates extra PS5 one haha

[2023-01-05 17:01:42] <+77mafia> The word Train comes from a French verb which means to draw or drag
[2023-01-05 17:02:10] <%WooordWooord> for the MMO players in the world FFXIV on controller is the shit. You still want a keyboard for typing purposes but when it comes to gameplay its dope

[2023-01-05 17:28:00] <+smacktor> Right, part of the issue is you lift heavy and engage your larger muscles groups. Those smaller muscles become weaker . PT's recommened other "smaller" exercises to help with that

[2023-01-05 17:48:11] <%WooordWooord> @YNGskoden based on your follow up I don't think so. but I think working out is the perfect place to work on your discipline. But yea a lot of people fail

[2023-01-05 17:51:07] <%AyOhDilon> Coffee makes you poop, so you might lose whatever your waste weighs

[2023-01-05 17:51:18] <%YNGskoden> @WooordWooord Was trying to go off what Viss was saying with the cold plunge and what things like that do to your mental. I personally failed to make progress over the years, not because of discipline to lift, but because I didn't have the discipline mentally for the diet. That's since changed, but I see it all the time with people. Sorry for the book but I guess that's what I was trying to say in less words.
[2023-01-05 17:51:18] <bucshy812> It also decreases appetite
[2023-01-05 17:51:20] <%+Pelchek> only water weight, not actual fat loss
[2023-01-05 17:51:24] <%+CosmicAlienOG> quiting sugar  / bread , you will lose weight without working out

[2023-01-05 20:43:00] <+GrittzNGravy> @gonzotronn bullets in geral go through walls. different guns to different ammounts. Viss is also using piercing ammo
[2023-01-05 20:43:31] <%+ameruski> @wooordwooord for warzone pretty much
[2023-01-05 20:43:51] <%JtotheDizzle> @wooordwooord the larger LMGs in general, because their bullet range drop off and recoil and rate of fire and large magazine size is favorable
[2023-01-05 20:44:02] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @wooordwooord its def one of the most well rounded. But i e also seen people having success running sniper and smg
[2023-01-05 20:44:15] <%JtotheDizzle> @wooordwooord the RPK also happens to use a barrel mag instead of belt feed so it reloads a ton faster
[2023-01-05 20:44:32] <+GrittzNGravy> i dont use the rpk and have no problems but its def the best gun by far

[2023-01-05 20:45:29] <%JtotheDizzle> RPK is in general most widely useful and Fennec has fastest TTK for short range engagements and mobility so they‚Äôre the most common right now.

[2023-01-05 21:22:33] <%+Gratchinsson> Someone must have said something outloud. Like "no one can beat Viss" and then twitch server was like "hold my beer"
[2023-01-05 21:22:43] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> Twitch needs to prorate subs for every minute everyone is without a badge. Kappa
