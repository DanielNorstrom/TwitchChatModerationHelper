[2023-01-04 11:19:30] <i_i_capn_crunch> 5.0 ghz is better for closer proximity i think
[2023-01-04 11:19:38] <+a_Leech> ^
[2023-01-04 11:20:18] <i_i_capn_crunch> Might be router dependent?

[2023-01-04 11:20:51] <+a_Leech> depends what the wall is made of
[2023-01-04 11:20:51] <fatracooncat> but depending on the wall it can weaken the signal
[2023-01-04 11:20:54] <!%Mikeverv> Leave your door open for your WIFI

[2023-01-04 14:42:17] <%Till_Ya> the pressure will still be there I think
[2023-01-04 14:42:19] <+Sooky_Booky> idk about warm but itll release
[2023-01-04 14:42:20] <%Till_Ya> but stops heating

[2023-01-04 14:42:26] <theThrix> yeah some recipes call for slow release of pressure
[2023-01-04 14:42:35] <%Till_Ya> depends on the quality of the product you are using I guess
[2023-01-04 14:42:35] <+Sooky_Booky> pressure will go down and so will temp
[2023-01-04 14:42:40] <%+FoxCasts> there is a keep warm function otherwise it will release slowly (for meats this is best anyway)
[2023-01-04 14:42:45] <%Nytan_TW> Pressure go down
[2023-01-04 14:42:46] <%sekcaJ> Depends on your hardware tbh
[2023-01-04 14:42:50] <%scorpionflower342> If you have a keep warm function
[2023-01-04 14:42:50] <+Wulfen001> but the stuff is cooked to death at some point... if all the water is gone then its burned inside... pressure remains until you release it

[2023-01-04 14:43:33] <%+FoxCasts> after the timer goes off it will stop "pressure cooking"
[2023-01-04 14:43:35] <+Sooky_Booky> exactly
[2023-01-04 14:43:51] <%sekcaJ> EU ikea is not like NA ikea
[2023-01-04 14:43:55] <+Wulfen001> if pressure is too high it releases some of the steam and meal gets dryed out at some point
[2023-01-04 14:43:56] <%Till_Ya> Hes going to ikea for the hotdogs in case the lamp is ass KEKW
[2023-01-04 14:43:58] <%+boytonius> I feel like youre gonna be cool if you leave it, after the timer it should stop Pressure cooking and just relase the pressure slowly

More trials are needed to identify the significance. from national library of medicine

[2023-01-04 15:02:27] <+tm_901> Scientists say they have found a way to make rice less calorific - boil it with coconut oil and then refrigerate for half a day before eating. According to the Sri Lankan researchers, treating rice in this way reduces its calories by up to 60%

[2023-01-04 15:07:34] <%Highsolic> No, reheating doesn't change the starch or calorie levels but, cooking leftover rice in a teaspoon of coconut oil will reduce the number of calories your body will absorb.

[2023-01-04 16:16:52] <slumsPM> what rank is this alt?
[2023-01-04 16:16:56] <%Till_Ya> wagyu a5 is absolute bomb, but not worth the price. You'll get a superior steak for 20$ as well
[2023-01-04 16:17:12] <%sekcaJ> 1hp ult KEKW
[2023-01-04 16:17:16] <blader0607> the steak is carried by the rub and the cook more
[2023-01-04 16:17:23] <NattoXO> the $100 wagyu is for one meal but a whole cake for $100 is many many days of cake
[2023-01-04 16:17:43] <%Spitfire2k6> @blader0607 Putting rub on a streak is fuckign sacrilege
[2023-01-04 16:17:52] <stevethedogg> @Till_Ya Personally i'm not a fan of A5 price point exluded it's just not my thing. I would take prime anyday.
[2023-01-04 16:17:52] <slumsPM> @NattoXO cake is literally nasty after the first bite who the hell eats cake for days lmaooo
[2023-01-04 16:18:05] <slumsPM> @Till_Ya same
[2023-01-04 16:18:06] <+Cake_Shot> hey, leave cake out of this
[2023-01-04 16:18:20] <NattoXO> idk what cake you're eating but the cakes i've had were not bad after the first day
[2023-01-04 16:18:28] <NattoXO> first bite*

[2023-01-04 16:19:14] <+emtee53> chocolate cakes are better after 1-2 days in the fridge
[2023-01-04 16:19:29] <NattoXO> what kind of cake though? there's tons of cake. my favorite cake has unsweetened whipped cream and fresh fruits.
[2023-01-04 16:19:36] <slumsPM> @emtee53 brownies def are

[2023-01-04 17:00:13] <+Gaelicanz> telling you it should've worked the same way as sojourn's right click
[2023-01-04 17:00:19] <+Gaelicanz> and then sojourn should be deleted
