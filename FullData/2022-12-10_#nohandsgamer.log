[2022-12-10 00:29:06] <%+ucdchris1> i think changing the card back for your deck will increase the efficiency of draws by 5 percent Kappa

[2022-12-10 00:33:05] <%RattlegoreLMBO> love it when you talk shit about warrior cards and how much blizzard hates warrior
[2022-12-10 00:33:12] <+apple_pyro> they design rogue and druid first and then outsource the rest of the classes
[2022-12-10 00:33:17] <%RattlegoreLMBO> Blizzard doesn't care about warrior players 😠
[2022-12-10 00:33:21] <DmichaelB0> Cause if you give warrior card draw it becomes most op deck out there
[2022-12-10 00:33:24] <gscarab> Warrior is the only class that still isn't allowed to have good card draw
[2022-12-10 00:33:28] <starman2995> compared with battle rage LUL

[2022-12-10 00:34:36] <%+ucdchris1> the warrior design team is actually a group of players who were bullied by control warrior years ago, and theyre plan is to make wariror weak forever

[2022-12-10 00:35:34] <raphurpapa> maybe because in the last control warrior meta lots of people left the game

[2022-12-10 00:35:50] <owain1607> one of my favorite quotes from a movie is Sigourney Weaver in Aliens when shes talking to the corporation council "did iq's just drop sharply while I was away?"
[2022-12-10 00:35:52] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> feels like if a class doesn't play 10 cards a turn they don't know what to do with it
[2022-12-10 00:35:54] <bizjeet5> infinite priest is the strongest priest deck right now
[2022-12-10 00:35:56] <liezito> There was no fun warrior deck for a long time
[2022-12-10 00:35:59] <bizjeet5> want list?

[2022-12-10 00:36:15] <+apple_pyro> warrior was frustrating to play against but you could always find decks that could stomp it

[2022-12-10 00:37:49] <%+Xeath5> 12/30 got nerfed

[2022-12-10 00:49:19] <melidolas> druid is shameless to play i think
[2022-12-10 00:49:38] <%RattlegoreLMBO> Druid is fun and the other armor class is bad :)

[2022-12-10 00:50:09] <caybellHS> @HouseTM i play some games where i cannot find guff at all and its funny how fair druid is like that

[2022-12-10 00:54:24] <%+ucdchris1> the closest class to being somewhat mana cheaty is frost dk right
[2022-12-10 00:54:32] <%+ucdchris1> only ebcause of the mana cheat spell
[2022-12-10 00:54:33] <5ftHax> unholy and frost could go without

[2022-12-10 00:55:31] <MB29G7> how come they didnt nerf druid?
[2022-12-10 00:55:32] <mstrike> Death knight feels incredibly fair vs a meta that’s all unfair decks
[2022-12-10 00:55:33] <+KiddieHS> @hrob16 good take :D any ideas on location?
[2022-12-10 00:55:46] <caybellHS> @NoHandsGamer if there was a college class called hearthstone 101, your salary gets doubled and you teach hearthstone to students, would you take the opportunity
[2022-12-10 00:55:58] <%+slighthaze> @konmad we all end up there eventually :d triple blood is at least playable
[2022-12-10 00:56:03] <DmichaelB0> Frost does
[2022-12-10 00:56:12] <%+shanevapid> I kinda wish they had released dk as op as day 1 dh for a few days. It wouldn’t feel as depressing as producing a brand new class that’s a complete flop
[2022-12-10 00:56:12] <caybellHS> i'd sign up
[2022-12-10 00:56:19] <%+ucdchris1> i wonder if theyll ever make a sequel to hearthstone like a whole new client etc

[2022-12-10 00:57:22] <caybellHS> i went like 1-8 with the deck
[2022-12-10 00:57:24] <rayquinox> Bro your beard is looking really good on you man, you keeping it?

[2022-12-10 00:58:42] <%matmarex> i felt like i looked older when i shaved
[2022-12-10 00:58:57] <mstrike> Beards are makeup for  men , they hide lines and saggy skin
[2022-12-10 00:58:58] <%$PervyOldGuy> i lie about my age. that helps

[2022-12-10 00:59:26] <%+shanevapid> I always told myself that I’d shave my head, get jacked and grow a beard once o started balding
[2022-12-10 00:59:39] <Debatingplains3> I played triple undead dk in casual and thought, this deck has some great summoning, rush, and board control. Then I played rogue in ranked and played 2 concoctions, drew 6 cards, and summoned a full board and 13/13 on 5 mana...
[2022-12-10 00:59:51] <%+slighthaze> Draw 2 cards for 0 mana and reduce their cost by 9 ... its fine Kappa
[2022-12-10 01:00:08] <BRONZIE_SK> how do i unlock DK? :D
[2022-12-10 01:00:16] <+kitelesss> back to imp warlock fam

[2022-12-10 01:00:41] <Debatingplains3> All control priest decks eventually become quest priest. All tempo priest decks eventually become boon.

[2022-12-10 01:01:41] <+Mr_M0jo> Hey NHG, are you satisfied with the nerfs?
[2022-12-10 01:01:41] <%+wowitssteven> uther got a beard
[2022-12-10 01:02:34] <+hilaryisthedevil> When you are refining a deck do you just make a lot of small changes or do you play one version and just observe and make big adjustments
[2022-12-10 01:02:34] <Debatingplains3> I think any meta breaker right now needs to either beat druid early and go even with rogue. Or consistently survive rogue and beat druid late. Also, both need to have a chance against the nuttiest boon turns.
[2022-12-10 01:02:45] <niodogz> @nohandsgamer hows the climb going with this deck?
[2022-12-10 01:02:55] <raphurpapa> shockspitter yes but sire no
[2022-12-10 01:02:56] <%matmarex> they really nerfed hunter after i only played like 10 games with it, wtf
[2022-12-10 01:03:32] <+dnasquared> shockspitter seemed like a nerf to 3 was reasonable.
[2022-12-10 01:03:42] <+quinode> shockspitter was such a stupid card
[2022-12-10 01:03:43] <Atpeta> secret Shaman Pog
[2022-12-10 01:03:51] <ElGuineo> as you said shockspitter is peak efficiency hearthstone
[2022-12-10 01:04:03] <Debatingplains3> I like it when the board state influences otk's. Prep bone spike is one of the best combos, because it mana cheats huge swings, but is reliant on board state.
[2022-12-10 01:04:22] <Zuranthium> shockspitter deck was really annoying, it was draw weapon on turn 1 or have very low chance to win
[2022-12-10 01:04:38] <%+shanevapid> Brother, if Boulderfist Ogre was the strongest thing available to do on turn 6 then people would be complaining and crying about it
[2022-12-10 01:04:41] <ElGuineo> New card PogU
[2022-12-10 01:05:12] <Obeseious> Shockspitter can still be a deck you just can’t go all in on it
[2022-12-10 01:05:12] <%+slighthaze> you gotta admit, they smashed Sire ... half the power and still the same cost :D
[2022-12-10 01:05:12] <%+shanevapid> It literally doesn’t even matter what’s broken because the petulant whining is ceaseless
[2022-12-10 01:05:13] <5ftHax> he wont scramble our egg surely
[2022-12-10 01:05:31] <loozy2> @slighthaze true, but it was very often overkill anyway

[2022-12-10 01:06:01] <@^Nightbot> Sell your possessions. Take a payday loan. Destroy your marriage. Do whatever it takes to get that legendary on day 1!
[2022-12-10 01:06:32] <5ftHax> they couldve tried to just cap the dmg at like 15 instead of killing the card
[2022-12-10 01:07:04] <+ninja_pengu1n> is deathrattle rogue a thing this xpac?
[2022-12-10 01:07:06] <%+ucdchris1> it never board clears for a 10 drop if u capo at 15
[2022-12-10 01:07:07] <+anch> If there was a difficult way for your opponent to counter shockspitter (like opponents holding 9-10 cards against curse warlock) then I wouldn’t have minded it.  There was no counter play
[2022-12-10 01:07:12] <%+ucdchris1> half the time u play sire to swing a board
[2022-12-10 01:07:13] <MB29G7> Sire is still playable, just compare it to Alex for 9 mana
[2022-12-10 01:07:25] <SadLH> WutFace
[2022-12-10 01:07:26] <%+ucdchris1> alex doesnt see play though
[2022-12-10 01:07:30] <%+ucdchris1> so ur comparison doesnt make sense

[2022-12-10 01:07:31] <%+slighthaze> new mode idea, 1v1 but the players draft the deck they both use ... taking turns picking cards until they both have the same 30 cards. thoughts? Kappa
[2022-12-10 01:07:47] <Obeseious> They are too lazy to change  words they only change numbers
[2022-12-10 01:08:00] <Huppster88> has anyone seen a spitter? or is it just done for?
[2022-12-10 01:08:00] <+quinode> @slighthaze too slow for 1v1
[2022-12-10 01:08:00] <%+shanevapid> Every complaint people had about Sire will be regurgitated in the coming weeks only with Astalor
[2022-12-10 01:08:27] <+Mr_M0jo> I just cut your arms off!
[2022-12-10 01:08:28] <gscarab> It's possible for two cards to be overpowered at once, yes
[2022-12-10 01:08:33] <deathcoreripper> but I love bran. :/
[2022-12-10 01:08:33] <+Mr_M0jo> Its just a flesh wound
[2022-12-10 01:08:34] <raphurpapa> hall of fame him?
[2022-12-10 01:08:35] <ElGuineo> maybe they could have made that it sarted at 1 damage instead of 5?
[2022-12-10 01:08:42] <+kalehs> neptulon gonna headbut ya
[2022-12-10 01:08:43] <%+slighthaze> @quinode damn it... ok, it's a best out of 7 run and we're running 20 card decks Kappa
[2022-12-10 01:08:48] <mightyergoTV> everyone is neefing around the main problem card which is brann

[2022-12-10 01:08:54] <swamiii> too early man
[2022-12-10 01:08:57] <loozy2> brann makes the win conditions more diverse
[2022-12-10 01:09:06] <MB29G7> @ucdchris1 before Sire came out Alex was in many builds just because it was 8 guranteed damage, sire is also defensive use
[2022-12-10 01:09:17] <Debatingplains3> Astalor is nothing like denathrius. You know when a lvl3 astalor is in hand, and you know just how much damage it will do. Denathrius had an inherent paranoia or surprise factor, both of which were unsatisfying.
[2022-12-10 01:09:37] <mightyergoTV> who would have thought bringing brann back into standard would enable a bunch of really dumb unfun combos and interactions
[2022-12-10 01:09:47] <Huppster88> why would brann have any interest in an old wooden ship?
[2022-12-10 01:09:47] <5ftHax> problem is with druid armor astalor works exactly like denathrius but faster
[2022-12-10 01:09:48] <SadLH> @Debatingplains3 Astalor is crazy good with armour druid though...
[2022-12-10 01:10:21] <+Brianbgrp> vs armor druid...if you know they have astalor in hand, your prolly already dead.

[2022-12-10 01:10:29] <Debatingplains3> @Debatingplains3 Druid is one class. Denathrius/renathal was nearly every class.
[2022-12-10 01:10:34] <mightyergoTV> astalor in druid is sire without the set up
[2022-12-10 01:10:35] <+ninja_pengu1n> ptsd from the dr. boom control warrior meta LUL  @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-10 01:10:44] <%+slighthaze> yeah, if HS had a card that was like 8 mana and did 10 damage to all enemies then Sire would have been fine Kappa

[2022-12-10 01:10:53] <+Mr_M0jo> like a slowly smoked sausage

[2022-12-10 01:10:56] <+kakademona87> I like all the poops :)
[2022-12-10 01:10:56] <+trenolds_tv> that could be like, 20 games of marvel snap
[2022-12-10 01:10:59] <NovaBSL> @Debatingplains3 Unless you're druid, then you can play all 3 Astalors in 1 turn together with a Bann FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-10 01:10:59] <IIAbeLincolnII> Prairie dog that poop
[2022-12-10 01:11:02] <Huppster88> long as in time? or......
[2022-12-10 01:11:07] <+Me5oHahny> like a citadel standing strong
[2022-12-10 01:11:10] <+kalehs> yeah mostly people wanna be in and out of a game in 5 mins, 10 tops
[2022-12-10 01:11:13] <+effective16> turned on the stream first thing I hear: I like long poops KEKW ok
[2022-12-10 01:11:18] <Giannhs1998> Well actually taking a long poop is unhealthy Aware
[2022-12-10 01:11:19] <DarksonerLOL> it depends but normally when games go long they are boring imo
[2022-12-10 01:11:22] <Erabus31> I have adhd, control mirrors are torture
[2022-12-10 01:11:30] <Debatingplains3> Shorter games are more interesting. Long games become really tiring clown fiestas.
[2022-12-10 01:11:32] <Huppster88> take a short long poop
[2022-12-10 01:11:40] <+hilaryisthedevil> Did you like old freeze mage. Seems like you would hate it
[2022-12-10 01:11:52] <+kalehs> but like also, the fact that there's enough deck diversity that you (kinda)  get to choose the length of game is cool
[2022-12-10 01:12:00] <reformedanduin> toilet players ruining ha once again fayeCry
[2022-12-10 01:12:03] <+quinode> wtf is up with these signature cards, they look so bad, why are they gray
[2022-12-10 01:12:07] <PPetition> putricide is undead isnt that pog for invincible
[2022-12-10 01:12:07] <reformedanduin> hs*
[2022-12-10 01:12:07] <Debatingplains3> But the only 40 card deck I play is maximum clown thief rogue. :v
[2022-12-10 01:12:19] <%+shanevapid> I want every game to end with both players at 80hp, 7 patch weeks on each side of the board, both players desperately playing copies of southsea scoundrel to try and stay ahead in fatigue. Real hearthstone baby
[2022-12-10 01:12:22] <LeonGaltran> Egg priest op.. thoughts ??

[2022-12-10 01:15:04] <garryhurz> u have 1 card he cant take u serious anymore
[2022-12-10 01:15:05] <%RattlegoreLMBO> sire is pretty bad
[2022-12-10 01:15:21] <+kalehs> You'd need to dedicate a lot more of the gameplan to him now
[2022-12-10 01:15:23] <garryhurz> we are dead
[2022-12-10 01:15:49] <+kakademona87> HS lies, there are no worthy opponents. Everyone is either "son of a gun" or a "Yugi boy" FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-10 01:15:50] <Debatingplains3> Why don't people run 30 card quest priest? Since finding certain cards is so important.
[2022-12-10 01:15:52] <%+slighthaze> if you can play minions until like Turn 40 I think Sire could be a factor... you playing imps? Kappa
[2022-12-10 01:16:24] <+kalehs> quest hunter could probably still use it
[2022-12-10 01:17:11] <%+slighthaze> yeah, I got a Carpet Bagger once... game said Worthy Opponent, but like I knew Kappa

[2022-12-10 01:17:42] <ElGuineo> what if game had 40hp by default and renathal was just you could play 40 card deck PepoG
[2022-12-10 01:18:14] <+b0bb31> Are the nerfed cards dead?

[2022-12-10 01:18:26] <Klaun14> why not draw 2 there?
[2022-12-10 01:18:33] <Debatingplains3> Make 40 the new default, but at the start of each game pyroblast both players. Makes it more exciting.
[2022-12-10 01:18:41] <+xiievilz> so does that mean ramp druid is dead ?
[2022-12-10 01:18:42] <+ericBG_> Do you think sire needed to Die?

[2022-12-10 01:31:17] <5ftHax> could we put in that in to make a stickier board
[2022-12-10 01:31:20] <+haoxus_wayne> I still don't understand why they made warrior bad 3 expansions in a roll
[2022-12-10 01:31:23] <+itskyc> Hey guys, nohands reacted to the nerfs already?
[2022-12-10 01:31:30] <%+slighthaze> Maw & Disorder still best Warlock deck ... add in new cards if you want, but not even needed SeemsGood
[2022-12-10 01:31:37] <+kalehs> any interest in playing more naga priest this expansion?

[2022-12-10 01:32:29] <+itskyc> @rotemv3 thanks
[2022-12-10 01:32:34] <Debatingplains3> This looks like a deck I made to get out of apprentice ranks. So as far as the core set goes, I think it's good.
[2022-12-10 01:33:46] <deathcoreripper> what about pelagos?
[2022-12-10 01:34:02] <Debatingplains3> Watchpost + silence? More buffs and some damage.
[2022-12-10 01:34:54] <the6thsensei_> !bestdeck
[2022-12-10 01:34:54] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-10 01:35:05] <deathcoreripper> what, really? it feels like an autowin if the opp cant remove him. he feels luke the best card of the deck
[2022-12-10 01:35:38] <Debatingplains3> I feel like the most expensive watchpost is sleeper. The buff hits before the spells effects. How dat not good?

[2022-12-10 01:52:15] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it was a bit much
[2022-12-10 01:52:29] <willwait428> What about undead deathrattle priest with the hero card for lethal unlimited deal 3 dmg
[2022-12-10 01:52:32] <Berserker_81> 40 from hand turn 6. so much fun. ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-10 01:52:43] <+Eranidor> its good if it's roguestone, so i can play my Armor Ramp Druid LUL

[2022-12-10 01:56:35] <SAM_GOLD> yeah sounds good
[2022-12-10 01:56:40] <dull_bulb> Won't affect paladins use of it, which was always my favorite implementation of sire
[2022-12-10 01:57:16] <dull_bulb> Like it'll be worse but you didn't juice it much anyway
[2022-12-10 01:57:19] <+honourhs> no xyrella?
[2022-12-10 01:58:08] <+Carthorn> i think sire should stick to 1 infuse, but only for enemy minions
[2022-12-10 01:58:16] <Debatingplains3> Silence shadow spell for corporal?
[2022-12-10 01:58:18] <willwait428> What about shadowed spirit and plaguespreader as only undead?
[2022-12-10 01:58:25] <rodrik_harlaw> the 3/3 is meh in a deck with so many expensive cards
[2022-12-10 01:58:29] <+num83r54r3c00l> kazakustan blood dk with reno but no duplicates sounds fun
[2022-12-10 01:58:36] <Debatingplains3> Whispers for corporal?
[2022-12-10 01:58:48] <dull_bulb> Not for this deck, but what are the whirlpool targets atm? shockspitter is one
[2022-12-10 01:59:05] <SavageWolves> Shockspitter is nerfed though
[2022-12-10 01:59:20] <dull_bulb> Tru still playable though
[2022-12-10 01:59:26] <+schnag> @num83r54r3c00l true could go reno but i feel like you would run out of good cards
[2022-12-10 01:59:29] <SAM_GOLD> the 4 mana beast maybe?
[2022-12-10 01:59:30] <rodrik_harlaw> 4/7/7
[2022-12-10 01:59:30] <willwait428> @nohandsgamer can I send a different version of undead priest?
[2022-12-10 01:59:33] <Debatingplains3> Could mill priest beat druid? Just make them draw their whole deck.
[2022-12-10 01:59:52] <dull_bulb> Playgespreader?
[2022-12-10 02:00:03] <+homanh> why not the 4mana 7/7
[2022-12-10 02:00:19] <+Carthorn> any way to cheat mana on priest?
[2022-12-10 02:00:20] <dull_bulb> If plaguespreader makes a deck it's this one right
[2022-12-10 02:00:21] <Debatingplains3> 3 mana for 5/5 is better than 5 mana for 7/7
[2022-12-10 02:00:32] <oqiwm> is shaman and warrior still dedge

[2022-12-10 02:38:30] <+Carthorn> do you need double order in the court, or would just one work?
[2022-12-10 02:38:30] <+datfrogger> @waligos22 most of the good dredge cards have some other secondary effect as well, just dredge on its own isnt that powerful
[2022-12-10 02:38:33] <TJSCOUSER_> its sweet spot for damage is between 30 and 40
[2022-12-10 02:38:39] <smoked411> Ahh
[2022-12-10 02:38:54] <Magnarn1> isnt renethal still on the nerf radar? so maybe frost might be eventually viable

[2022-12-10 02:39:52] <wuaschtsemmeog> Imo if meta revolves around nonstealth minions on board frost is decent.
[2022-12-10 02:39:55] <TJSCOUSER_> i honestly think renathal gets the baku genn treatment

[2022-12-10 02:52:01] <!%pocket_train> Imo infuse is an incredibly uninteresting mechanic in practice, cool in theory but doesn't work
[2022-12-10 02:52:04] <dull_bulb> What do you think of the nerf to Quel'dallore to 1 revive max? I thought it was a little unnecessary
[2022-12-10 02:52:09] <twitch___________ad_block> Theo worthless without sire

[2022-12-10 02:53:34] <OurYoungHero> I feel like "Seal of Blood" would be a little better if instead of damaging your hero it damaged the enemy hero. Thoughts?
[2022-12-10 02:53:41] <!%pocket_train> LUL you keep saying Kazakusan and the only card I have hated more than that was Illucia
[2022-12-10 02:53:54] <aetrix_gaming> @dontneednickname good. Easy win for us :)
[2022-12-10 02:53:59] <grimBleeper> i like kazakusan and prestor when i have steamcleaner in my hand :]

[2022-12-10 02:54:37] <+Eranidor> @OurYoungHero that makes DK too OP and blizzard would instantly nerf it LUL
[2022-12-10 02:54:39] <%+irrationalwife> @kilrfish ur not a well designed chatter

[2022-12-10 02:54:57] <kilrfish> Post nerf kaz was fine, kaz rush was not good for the game
[2022-12-10 02:54:57] <+Eranidor> they press nerf button to soon if they change those things LUL
[2022-12-10 02:55:15] <+LittleLostKiwi> Hey Nohands, may I ask why the deck doesn't run the hero card? It seems like it would be an auto include

[2022-12-10 02:56:01] <5ftHax> i feel like sermon could be a better card tbh
[2022-12-10 02:56:32] <+shlump_xd> @littlelostkiwi he said the deck is tryna kill not control, plus it messes with order in the court
[2022-12-10 02:56:32] <5ftHax> maybe kings is better idk

[2022-12-10 02:57:55] <!%pocket_train> countess is the least consistent part of the deck. you should cut it Kappa
[2022-12-10 02:57:57] <kilrfish> Maybe, isn't sermon just a bad card though?
[2022-12-10 02:57:57] <grimBleeper> hmm, maybe needs denathrius and sylvanus Kappa
[2022-12-10 02:57:57] <+shlump_xd> Objectively consistent

[2022-12-10 03:04:35] <kilrfish> shouldn't this deck be more aggressive, playing better curve 2s then battle vicar and not playing sermon
[2022-12-10 03:05:13] <MB29G7> what would you consider proper nerfs for druid? 8 mana boy going to 10? part of the problem is that they can full combo with 11 mana, so they dont even need guff
[2022-12-10 03:05:35] <+Carthorn> @eranidor true lol
[2022-12-10 03:05:38] <+Eranidor> @MB29G7 Celestial Allignement :)

Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-10 05:30:28] <prabh23> It’s true warrior was the best class in wild last year and then the quest got nerfed twice
[2022-12-10 05:30:32] <prabh23> And now it’s the worst
