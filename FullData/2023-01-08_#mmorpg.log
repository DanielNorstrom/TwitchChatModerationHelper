[2023-01-08 13:27:37] <%nodtomc> i think the reason they said vorkath specifically was because they pitched the boss as a solo repeatable quest boss like vorkath, but this is harder

Once the corp's stats are low enough he fights it without taking any damage due to its low stats, which saves a lot of food.

[2023-01-08 15:08:39] <@%OffKong> we have 8 weeks to form a habit of keeping active, a habit typically takes 60 days to form to where it becomes constant
[2023-01-08 15:08:41] <@%OffKong> so i'm excited
[2023-01-08 15:08:45] <+Rellies> i cant get back into cardio anymore lol, i enjoy endurance training more
[2023-01-08 15:08:50] <@%OffKong> HIIT is best for burning calories
[2023-01-08 15:08:50] <%avrge_> whats after next then hard mode tob?
[2023-01-08 15:08:52] <+godshamsters> swimming is the best for cardio

[2023-01-08 15:08:55] <TjeeRocka> HIIT training
[2023-01-08 15:08:58] <rossathompson94> the best exercise is the one you can do consistently without giving up.
[2023-01-08 15:09:03] <Dreadnuts> anything that gets u moving is the best exercise
[2023-01-08 15:09:05] <%+07_mmk> 30 minutes of skipping is probably better than running/walking :D
[2023-01-08 15:09:07] <%+Hawkzrael> what pieces left
[2023-01-08 15:09:13] <@%OffKong> High intensity interval training
[2023-01-08 15:09:14] <motomoshi_> it depends on your fitness level, it's all depending on what your heart rate is how beneficial the cardio is
[2023-01-08 15:09:19] <Thu0cLa0> cardio is endurance training
[2023-01-08 15:09:26] <agilitycr> @OffKong For efficiency it is but walking 1 km and running 1 km burns the same caloriesa
