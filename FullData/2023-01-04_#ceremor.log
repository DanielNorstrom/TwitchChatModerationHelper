[2023-01-04 00:10:11] <@%+Chaosshield> I was able to program a special bandage you could craft with a perk (that then let you move while bandaging), but I didn't want that solution
[2023-01-04 00:10:14] <%JValentineTV> @The_Venom_Inside honestly, planning. Stuff goes sideways like dominos on this server. You want to stop it before it starts
[2023-01-04 00:10:18] <Landberguz> @The_Venom_Inside theres drybags you can put in your inventory, theres water resistant clothing, theres ignition tools that work even when wet

[2023-01-04 00:10:53] <@%+Chaosshield> I wanted it to work with just the normal bandages
[2023-01-04 00:11:03] <%staticsean87> @the_venom_inside you need a lighter or flare I think
[2023-01-04 00:11:07] <+The_Venom_Inside> ignition tools that work when wet on this server wow @landberguz

[2023-01-04 00:11:42] <%hopeful_comp> Let's hope it has high chance of lighting the fire, cause one blue canister only gives like 2-3 tries
[2023-01-04 00:11:48] <Landberguz> @The_Venom_Inside a hint is that you spawn with it ;)

[2023-01-04 00:12:31] <@%+Chaosshield> I think the failure chance only applies to matches, I fucked up like 6 times using matches with a fire but it worked first try with the road flare
[2023-01-04 00:12:36] <+The_Venom_Inside> Are you not paying attention I said aside from the flare @landberguz

[2023-01-04 01:24:39] <gustafprocyon> if there's small microstutters since nightfall it's prob dayz's darkness noise overloading encoder

[2023-01-04 01:27:41] <gustafprocyon> just saw the microsttuter and i think it's because of the visual noise of night time in dayz, that noise overloads your encoder, turning the gamma in your gamma scene down a little should fix it

[2023-01-04 03:33:13] <%JValentineTV> @plumdog94 Theres a higher population density and greater desperation on the coast. More chance he'll have to kill people. Thus sanity
[2023-01-04 03:33:15] <stashanz> @plumdog94 it doesnt, he needs meds to cure sanity due to freshies getting killed

[2023-01-04 03:33:54] <+The_Venom_Inside> @plumdog94 it doesn't what he is implying is he is going to the coast to mass kill and will need sanity meds to bring his sanity back to healthy levels

[2023-01-04 03:39:28] <th3_b3hold3r> I could get behind that. I dont agree with some that think it should be considered a criminal offense though. More and more think it should be, which I disagree.

[2023-01-04 04:06:28] <CiggyFreudd> @otterlyfn I recommend using the app izurvive on your phone for maps. food can be found on zombies if you're struggling to find it in houses.
[2023-01-04 04:06:42] <%sparr_w> also feels like you hit 2 hospitals and all of a sudden you're a walking infirmary or at least from my experience

[2023-01-04 05:29:38] <@%+sanguine00> Atlas cornered the namalsk legacy gunplay market
[2023-01-04 05:29:47] <+OMGitsProvidence> Namalsk is a straight line because more people play DayZ live in the cold IRL and it’s like home to them
[2023-01-04 05:29:48] <%spencethebence> A dayone Legacy Namalsk would be full all day but Sanguine is a coward.

[2023-01-04 05:30:09] <%+Boomer196> i think 50 is the real sweet spot for Namalsk
[2023-01-04 05:30:19] <$lilmikeli> because it happened to me on livonia
[2023-01-04 05:30:29] <$lilmikeli> today
[2023-01-04 05:30:32] <+Genzmoe> ive played on namalsk servers with 50 and honestly it made me prefer 40
[2023-01-04 05:30:34] <@%+sanguine00> people bottleneck in the spawn zones with too many players on Namalsk
[2023-01-04 05:30:35] <+OMGitsProvidence> 80 is so fun
[2023-01-04 05:30:57] <+OMGitsProvidence> But 80 is Alaskan Hobo Boxing
[2023-01-04 05:30:57] <PROLIF3> namalsk is straight line because smaller servers/maps with more interaction are more popular these days. Ceremor wont even run to tisy for 800$ no wonder chernarus dips to 10 population for half the day

[2023-01-04 05:32:20] <@%^Nightbot> The legacy gunplay mod replicates the weapon mechanics that DayZ used prior to the new player controller. Heavier weapons have more inertia when swinging to aim. Hipfire is no longer a laser beam when firing full auto. ADSing is slightly slower. Recoil is more impactful.
