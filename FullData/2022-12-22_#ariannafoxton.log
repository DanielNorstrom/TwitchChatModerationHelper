[2022-12-22 00:00:04] <coobakabg> well the friendly fire sounds like a skill issue
[2022-12-22 00:00:13] <+Lufishshmebb> A-10 being shot down by barry with a MANPAD is more expensive than a Hellfire

[2022-12-22 00:03:01] <%LossyInput> the role of tanks has shifted but the need for armored weapon platforms is never going to go away as long as warfare is still a thing

[2022-12-22 00:03:15] <+Wocka_Fulf> The age of the tank is gone. We're seeing that not. You can send a team of 10 guys with javs or even as simple as an RPG and take out 3-4 tanks without risking a tank. With drones and IR, it's for sure a thing of the past.
[2022-12-22 00:03:22] <+Lufishshmebb> do we need to get the defence onion diagram for tanks out again? If you're only relying on your armour to protect your tank you've fucked up hard

[2022-12-22 00:51:50] <@%Wloos> Generally speaking, I think a lot of people can benefit from emotional intelligence
[2022-12-22 00:52:13] <%JakeoftheWest> My approach to a better way would be much more free form. With the easy access to all human information I think its more important to teach critical thinking skills and creative problem solving than Dates and Numbers. Not saying those are unimportant, but its so easy and simple to look up that info. Its more important to be able to evaluate sources and apply logic to problems
[2022-12-22 00:52:26] <+cab090> I had teachers who just simply teach "Follow the intructions..." ideal and everything will be fine
[2022-12-22 00:52:26] <%Beulena> I mean I count the UK as part of europe, but I think the education is a meme here

[2022-12-22 22:28:05] <%Boomer8076> I think they mean to basically slap the rudder to make you wag your planes tail section in hopes the missile misses
[2022-12-22 22:28:25] <%Boomer8076> But that wouldn't do anything since all the missiles are proxy detonation
