[2023-01-02 00:00:06] <%shagoliravioli> @jordanu my computer is 10 years old and in no way a gaming pc, my computer handles a medium world with default embark size and 200 year history well
[2023-01-02 00:00:07] <%+1979HondaAccord> jesse what the fuck are you talking about
[2023-01-02 00:00:07] <%$Grahfvitnir> It's metal
[2023-01-02 00:00:07] <sinopense> the opposite of therapeutic
[2023-01-02 00:00:07] <%artificiallynatural> tin and copper alloy
[2023-01-02 00:00:14] <$SlowpokeBloke> @Laimubot but shouldnt she be green?
[2023-01-02 00:00:15] <%$peekas0> It should be noted that multithreading didn't really exist back in 2002.
[2023-01-02 00:00:17] <%earin_copper> @Renkage I actually find it kind of nice to set it to 10: you get one wave of immigrants and then children and petitions are most of your growth
[2023-01-02 00:00:20] <%MakorelFish> I remember the code they used was kind of off beat too. Wasn't it made in like, assembly?

[2023-01-02 00:01:09] <%+JordanU> @shagoliravioli 200 years old is kinda stretching it (my cpu gives out around 140 years) but gaming pc doesnt really make a difference since gpu doesnt do anything either

[2023-01-02 00:03:10] <%+JordanU> You can also turn the difficulty up if you want bigger invasions I think
[2023-01-02 00:03:18] <Chessrook44> Admittedly, sometimes the added challenge can be WHERE you embark.
[2023-01-02 00:03:23] <%Spylon> I think we already had a couple of clowns

[2023-01-02 01:53:45] <%$Cpt_Chug> i believe then new coder has plans to utilize GPU so theres that
[2023-01-02 01:53:45] <%+Zakaluka15> I'm of the belief that adaptive voltage overclocking helps somehwat

[2023-01-02 01:53:46] <blerbl> turn off cavern dwellers to help FPS. They eventually kill your game
[2023-01-02 01:53:51] <Putnam3145> it's just that it does a good amount
[2023-01-02 01:53:51] <+ghost_mira> Honestly- with all the things that are tracked in DF, that it runs as well as it does on a single core is amazing
