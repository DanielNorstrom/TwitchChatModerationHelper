[2022-12-07 16:35:47] <%+Saltymuffingaming> I tried my hand at streaming for about 8 months. I may try again someday, as i only played games to try and be popular and it exhausted me, wasnt fun. saltym1DAB saltym1DAB

[2022-12-07 16:36:43] <vparkr> @gomattzilla who or what would they unionize against
[2022-12-07 16:36:49] <@%Oshleyy> you can set your own schedule, thus having permanent leverage over your partner to "go make me food" or "walk the dog" or "wipe my bum IM the streamer"

[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <%+SlySgaile> @iddqd btw it also learns oyur hiding patterns, but it usually only reacts to the radar when you  use it for too long
