[2022-12-08 18:38:48] <%presto_fn> amaraldo Its just a different method of assisting your aim.
[2022-12-08 18:39:04] <%presto_fn> Like you gotta be high af on COPIUM
[2022-12-08 18:39:32] <Amaraldo> @presto_fn right but one is much clearly stronger than the other
[2022-12-08 18:39:47] <%presto_fn> Right because mouse is easier to aim more precisely
[2022-12-08 18:39:54] <+neezygames> Just don‚Äôt die it‚Äôs ez
[2022-12-08 18:39:54] <%presto_fn> It's still aim assist

[2022-12-08 18:42:23] <@%90sMixedTapes> it's all how things are worded so ppl dont take it out of context. kind of exhausting

[2022-12-08 18:42:43] <movedchip> Is it actually aim assist kbm or click  bait?
[2022-12-08 18:42:44] <Amaraldo> @presto_fn Eh. Aim assist on controller literally corrects your aim by tracking on a player so long as you're moving your character
[2022-12-08 18:42:49] <Dandulf> 69 ping, nice
[2022-12-08 18:42:56] <+neezygames> @knockingplayer kekw

[2022-12-08 18:43:38] <%chase1263070> hoursAyy
[2022-12-08 18:43:41] <%presto_fn> @amaraldo I'm aware. The point is "mouse magnetism" is still aim assist because the purpose is the same
[2022-12-08 18:43:47] <+neezygames> I have an ED. But I ain‚Äôt talking eating disorder if you know what I mean üòâ
[2022-12-08 18:43:55] <Dandulf> @dawsrrr78 yep, it's just the same 30 people from the last 4 Halo games
[2022-12-08 18:43:56] <%presto_fn> Aim lock with mouse would be detrimental

[2022-12-08 20:51:48] <%^davidskii> Tom is technically 5‚Äô7 and 3/4 but cmon that is really just 5‚Äô8 and he always wear shoes so you gotta add an inch. So really he is 5‚Äô9, but you always gotta round to the nearest 10 so really he is 5‚Äô10. But you got to carry the 1 also, so really he is 5‚Äô11. And everyone knows that 5‚Äô11 is really just 6‚Äô0. So he is really 6‚Äô0, but 6‚Äô0 is an awkward height. So really he is 6‚Äô1 right? But 6‚Äô1 is a prime number and you cant just let it hang like that so really he is 6‚Äô2.
