[2023-01-07 19:16:30] <%Dstruktr> when you inter change, you swap things
[2023-01-07 19:16:32] <BadST> –æ–±–º–µ–Ω

[2023-01-07 19:16:39] <ruttiger_sr> Interchange is another word for swapping in english
[2023-01-07 19:16:52] <@%727life> Yeah like that

[2023-01-07 19:18:25] <@%727life> –æ–±–º–µ–Ω is like swapping/ changing and I could't understand what would make the map name different

[2023-01-07 21:33:08] <%low_polygons05> @shoqapiik yeah you just pay 1mill and its all reset, i think therapists rep regain is much more annoying
[2023-01-07 21:33:09] <$ascan_io> double action is less accurate
