[2023-01-05 00:54:50] <$monica_duh> I don't understand the concept of battle passes tbh.
[2023-01-05 00:54:54] <$monica_duh> so I just don't bother with it.
[2023-01-05 00:55:01] <+zombiesgosplat> hope they double on the mythic skins to make up for no hero

[2023-01-05 00:55:09] <thetonyflamingo> @monica_duh rewards for playing game but more if you spend 10$
[2023-01-05 00:55:22] <%jar0bi> hog

[2023-01-05 00:56:20] <thetonyflamingo> @monica_duh get rewards a little faster and get more and the new hero if there is one instantly
[2023-01-05 00:56:20] <Its_Phenox> when is the next patch scheduled to drop?
[2023-01-05 00:56:24] <$monica_duh> I haven't seen pretty Mercy skins in the battle pass path yet so I'll pass for now.
[2023-01-05 00:56:24] <critzyqt> battle pass is good if you want it
[2023-01-05 00:56:38] <!%Blizz_Craig> @monica_duh Everyone at least participates on what is called the "free track" which some of the rewards are granted for all players, you can also purchase the Battle Pass at any time during the season to unlock the rewards from the premium track for the tiers you already completed.

[2023-01-05 15:17:43] <NightyKnight09> Question about junker Queen: do you think if they adjusted how fast her bleed effect applies damage, (so it‚Äôs a more rapid burst) it would even out the kiriko counter a bit since it needs a much faster response to help?

[2023-01-05 15:18:20] <Daily10433> if they don't then yeah it's useless
[2023-01-05 15:18:24] <ohlimealime> yeah, but it can keep the team alive. if a hog, junkrat, reaper, tracer or anyone keeps flanking it can save the team. especially if there is an enemy widow.

[2023-01-05 15:20:41] <jefrilapalona> ariisa
[2023-01-05 15:20:42] <Daily10433> DVa is pretty balanced rn
[2023-01-05 15:20:47] <ogkushkilla02> If they don‚Äôt need hog ASAP people are going to be upset me included
[2023-01-05 15:20:51] <bigchungus1245654> shes ok
[2023-01-05 15:20:52] <Coffeesforlosers> @pkkspiral ooooof that's a good one!
[2023-01-05 15:20:59] <micgandy19> What patch is coming out?
[2023-01-05 15:21:02] <%+dookin0nya> dva is not unplayable. I feel like u can still play her no matter what
[2023-01-05 15:21:10] <b0ngflicked> I‚Äôm stuck in bronze right now I can‚Äôt stand it. I can counter everyone but my supports always lack with dva
[2023-01-05 15:21:10] <%JustSwufty> DVa in general is cool, But her Ult make me sad
[2023-01-05 15:21:10] <$Aceattack> next season balance will be interesting when no new hero will be added to sandbox
[2023-01-05 15:21:21] <thatsameuser> hi
[2023-01-05 15:21:27] <festivebeanie> bring back brig stunbash
[2023-01-05 15:21:30] <hatzmad> Do you think that there's too much damage in the game right now?
[2023-01-05 15:21:33] <OnionPowered> who is the counter for ramattra
[2023-01-05 15:21:33] <%+hageandrew> Dva shield is pretty good rn and she can move
[2023-01-05 15:21:38] <Coffeesforlosers> if I see a hog I simply just run the other way
[2023-01-05 15:21:48] <+chilloutdanny_> @onionpowered hog
[2023-01-05 15:21:49] <ogkushkilla02> It depends on comp!
[2023-01-05 15:21:52] <%Pkkspiral> @OnionPowered Zen gaps him pretty hard.
[2023-01-05 15:21:55] <$Aceattack> orisa makes rein unplayable which is weird macro balancing
[2023-01-05 15:21:55] VIEWERS: 460
[2023-01-05 15:22:04] <ogkushkilla02> Guru plays Dva and smashes
[2023-01-05 15:22:06] <Peekiimon> Fun fact: D.va dominates on PlayStation and no one can explain why
[2023-01-05 15:22:07] <+chilloutdanny_> oh yea. zen mhm
[2023-01-05 15:22:07] <svartaloka> we need more last long defense matrix
[2023-01-05 15:22:08] <%+hageandrew> Dva with a zen is a good dive combo
[2023-01-05 15:22:08] <%JustSwufty> So When they rework Hog, Do you think they'll slight nerf Orisa
[2023-01-05 15:22:10] <+ThaRealBigShotBob> what would you say the meta comp right now is overall?
[2023-01-05 15:22:20] <+SOLARJOLT> Until yesterday, I was hesitant to change hog's one shot. I was playing Zenyatta and it was misery.
[2023-01-05 15:22:23] <%JustSwufty> So When they rework Hog, Do you think they'll slight nerf Orisa?
[2023-01-05 15:22:24] <ogkushkilla02> Guru squish!!!!!
[2023-01-05 15:22:26] <festivebeanie> :(
[2023-01-05 15:22:27] <OnionPowered> @OnionPowered we discussed with my team that possibly ana sleeping him lol
[2023-01-05 15:22:33] <lostarkmelee1> @peekiimon yeah that's definitely not true
[2023-01-05 15:22:35] <%+Frankenfunk> Give brig a rocket launcher
[2023-01-05 15:22:38] <+vaniitas4> do you think they will nerf widow? I hope they don't
[2023-01-05 15:22:39] <@%^StreamElements> We're looking to add more moderators for Twitch chat! Apply here if you're interested and have time to spare: https://forms.gle/nX2d6AN9VxKfw4PF6
[2023-01-05 15:22:41] <LordDikusMaximus> do you only get top 500 after GM 1?
[2023-01-05 15:22:49] <+SOLARJOLT> Even got 1 shot from full without hook.
[2023-01-05 15:22:51] <%enreves> Honestly I think Brig is ok. Just a bad meta for her
[2023-01-05 15:22:52] <+maddthemadd> Junker Queen buff today?
[2023-01-05 15:22:52] <b0ngflicked> I still love dva, solos anyone if done right
[2023-01-05 15:22:56] <betakuk420> Bring back Bastion shield
[2023-01-05 15:22:57] <%JustSwufty> Give Brig Bombs!
[2023-01-05 15:22:57] <%+McNugNug> make hog a displacement hero, make his one shot combo do less damage or make it easier to get out of before the combo
[2023-01-05 15:23:01] <festivebeanie> @frankenfunk yes 8)
[2023-01-05 15:23:05] <vergil_hc> good morning Emongg
[2023-01-05 15:23:06] <%shavus88> I would like to see Brig's shield slam get an interrupt but not a stun
[2023-01-05 15:23:07] <strawicy> why isnt ana played more when hog is so good?
[2023-01-05 15:23:10] <$Aceattack> reinhardt is good against ramattra
[2023-01-05 15:23:12] <lil_skittles87> How do you think they will buff queen
[2023-01-05 15:23:31] <%+hageandrew> Playing support against a hog is torture
[2023-01-05 15:23:36] <%JustSwufty> GIVE BRIG EXPLOSIVES! LIKE JUNKRAT!!
[2023-01-05 15:23:36] <hatzmad> Thoughts on if Ana's nade was a lingering effect on the ground?
[2023-01-05 15:23:40] <%JustSwufty> lol
[2023-01-05 15:23:42] <Daily10433> hog won't be fun if his one shot is completely removed
[2023-01-05 15:23:45] <festivebeanie> @shavus88 agreed. It interrupts certain things still but
[2023-01-05 15:23:45] <$Aceattack> instead of counters there should be skill matchups for tank roster
[2023-01-05 15:23:48] <LordDikusMaximus> now all we need is widow deleted from the game
[2023-01-05 15:23:50] <%N30NxL1T3x> it's entirely too early ml7Stare
[2023-01-05 15:23:51] <%+dookin0nya> how do u feel about Mei damage output?
[2023-01-05 15:23:55] VIEWERS: 460
[2023-01-05 15:24:21] <%+McNugNug> i would love it if they made his hook have less cooldown but make the hook less range and no one shot combo, make him a displacement hero rather than his off-tank identity
[2023-01-05 15:24:23] <Coffeesforlosers> I love playing zen but pretty much can't if there's a hog because they hook me every time, I don't know how to avoid the hook when I have the limited mobility that zen has
[2023-01-05 15:24:26] <ogkushkilla02> Emonng if they don‚Äôt nerf hog I will be so sad. I main Ramatra rn and hog is the only one who stops me consistently. He is such a free character!!
[2023-01-05 15:24:28] <%Pkkspiral> @Daily10433 Oh well emongShrug
[2023-01-05 15:24:32] <%+BigKingManatee> what are you hoping to see as far as Queen changes?
[2023-01-05 15:24:33] <%enreves> JQ buffs HYPERYump
[2023-01-05 15:24:37] <+its_bacon_> I feel like even if they change his 1 shot his hook is still so strong on its own if your team is right behind you shooting whoever you hooked
[2023-01-05 15:24:39] <%+DarthBinnie> Think they'll change the map pool? I'm not a fan of it
[2023-01-05 15:24:47] <+ImNovocain> Random thought but I feel like Ram/ Mei is gonna be a scary combo one day
[2023-01-05 15:24:53] <Vroxxes32> Is this the mid season patch?!
[2023-01-05 15:24:54] <+ImNovocain> If not already
[2023-01-05 15:24:56] <+maktrophies> if patch notes are today when is the release of the patch?
[2023-01-05 15:24:57] <%+ACslayerrr> Good morning!
[2023-01-05 15:24:58] <Daily10433> please being back Hollywoodüôè
[2023-01-05 15:25:02] <+vaniitas4> do you guys think widow needs nerfs ?
[2023-01-05 15:25:06] <%Pkkspiral> @Coffeesforlosers I just discord and try to put as many targets directly in front of me as possible. Even lowering the chance for hook is enough, sometimes.
[2023-01-05 15:25:08] <+SOLARJOLT> Do you think reducing scrap gun's primary damage and changing his alt fire to be a projectile more similar to accretion would be a fun/balance change? No stun, obviously.  @emongg
[2023-01-05 15:25:11] <speedyfire36> What are the patches
[2023-01-05 15:25:12] <%+smittnkittn93> Bring back all the maps! I miss Numbani!
[2023-01-05 15:25:15] <LordDikusMaximus> @Emongg do you think every 1 shot should be removed from the game?
[2023-01-05 15:25:15] <$Dragoncrest8> are you gonna go for the brig skin?
[2023-01-05 15:25:17] <%N30NxL1T3x> I think we should play one map everyday
[2023-01-05 15:25:19] <+ttalky> do you think they should nerf mercy damage boost or balance characters around potential damage boost?
[2023-01-05 15:25:20] <festivebeanie> widow is only good on certain maps isn't she?
[2023-01-05 15:25:23] <jackbro95840> Do you think they will buff or nerf junker queen
[2023-01-05 15:25:24] <Peekiimon> Everyone will be so let down if they are not gonna balance today NotLikeThis
[2023-01-05 15:25:28] <vergil_hc> @vaniitas4 no? xD whats the point of widow if she does not have 1 shot kills
[2023-01-05 15:25:30] <+BradDawg33> Can‚Äôt wait for Hollywood and watchpoint to be added back next season as new content
[2023-01-05 15:25:34] <%+dookin0nya> do u know why they won't bring back all maps?
[2023-01-05 15:25:40] <butterstubs> Bro needs a big disclaimer on screen PATCH ISN'T  RELEASED YET lmao
[2023-01-05 15:25:50] <thootlesdv> what is your opinion on the control maps
[2023-01-05 15:25:56] <+chilloutdanny_> JQ needs a buff. she's so fun to play üò≠
[2023-01-05 15:25:56] VIEWERS: 796
[2023-01-05 15:26:03] <%shavus88> Do you think Sojurn will be touched again?
[2023-01-05 15:26:04] <ogkushkilla02> So like Ram hard counters Brig Idk how she supposed to work with him in the game and how people counter pick
[2023-01-05 15:26:04] <+Beersens> The the updates the new lootboxes?
[2023-01-05 15:26:05] <+vaniitas4> @vergil_hc yea, that's whay I'm talking about, everyone is complaining about her one shot and they don't know that it's not easy to hit that one shot
[2023-01-05 15:26:06] <Daily10433> 2cp or push
[2023-01-05 15:26:10] <+its_bacon_> Do you think the only buffs she needs is less cooldowns on her abilities?
[2023-01-05 15:26:10] <lostarkmelee1> Nerf Tik Tok Moira
[2023-01-05 15:26:10] <megaspectr> You guys think they‚Äôll nerf orisa?
[2023-01-05 15:26:10] <vergil_hc> Queen needs some love. but no damage. she needs survivabillity
[2023-01-05 15:26:11] <hatzmad> Genji could get a buff this patch or nerf it's a 50/50.
[2023-01-05 15:26:17] <Bythisgirl> good morning.
[2023-01-05 15:26:22] <+ImNovocain> I‚Äôd prob lose any hope I had left in them if they nerfed Queen

[2023-01-05 15:26:28] <+steaknegggs> wut aboot havana and numbani, them coming to rotation, keep rialto, bring back hollywood, keep shambali, plus new map
[2023-01-05 15:26:31] <%Pkkspiral> @lostarkmelee1 Beat on her as Zen.
[2023-01-05 15:26:41] <+vaniitas4> I want the workshop back
[2023-01-05 15:26:43] <vergil_hc> @vaniitas4 well its mostly new players that complain. because they cant position themselves well
[2023-01-05 15:26:43] <ogkushkilla02> Brig shield useless against Ramatra
[2023-01-05 15:26:43] <+MoondyxR> good morning brotha
[2023-01-05 15:26:45] <%+ProjektTheory> Morning! Is the patch today balance and event? Or just event
[2023-01-05 15:26:46] <speedyfire36> Nerf genji
[2023-01-05 15:26:49] <MarioMadness64> Notice how all new heros are getting buffs, while old ow hero‚Äôs are getting hard nerfs. Doesn‚Äôt make sense?!

[2023-01-05 15:27:16] <%+dookin0nya> do u think they will add more dmg to rein firestrike ?
[2023-01-05 15:27:24] <%Pkkspiral> @MarioMadness64 They want to keep people interested in the new characters, since they're the biggest draw to the game righ tnow.
[2023-01-05 15:27:26] <+xMagzy> orisa is in a good spot rn imo
[2023-01-05 15:27:26] <vergil_hc> @vaniitas4 and i've seen my fair share of newbies just exploding vs an enemy widow because they stoopidly stand out in the open
[2023-01-05 15:27:39] <vergil_hc> orisa is to opressive
[2023-01-05 15:27:46] <vergil_hc> she needs a survivability tuning
[2023-01-05 15:27:57] <%$TharVGM> she is too hard to kill
[2023-01-05 15:27:57] VIEWERS: 896
[2023-01-05 15:28:00] <+steaknegggs> new patch adds aim assist when dps is negative 5 k/d or lower /s
[2023-01-05 15:28:08] <%JustSwufty> Orisa should get slight nerf after Hog rework
[2023-01-05 15:28:09] <%Pkkspiral> @steaknegggs KEKW
[2023-01-05 15:28:14] <megaspectr> They need to buff her self healing more tbh
[2023-01-05 15:28:25] <+SOLARJOLT> What would you say to Roadhog's alt fire being a ranged projectile for poke instead of a ranged shotgun blast?
[2023-01-05 15:28:26] <%$Jungleboogie30> Could u buff commanding sahout but ONLY for JQ
[2023-01-05 15:28:26] <+steaknegggs> jk looking forward to olympus and whatever the patch really is!
[2023-01-05 15:28:30] <festivebeanie> dmg reduction in shout? like hogs juice
[2023-01-05 15:28:39] <+vaniitas4> @vergil_hc really, I had a lot of enemies saying lucky shots while they're standing in the middle of no where  and jump spamming which makes it easier to hit them
[2023-01-05 15:28:39] <vergil_hc> @Emongg queen should get a bit of armor. like 425 hp + 75 armor. i think that might be enough for her
[2023-01-05 15:28:48] <%JustSwufty> Nice Kiriko Gameplay
[2023-01-05 15:28:48] <+Beersens> What about junkrat traps stopping queens ult

[2023-01-05 15:29:36] <ogkushkilla02> Increase health???
[2023-01-05 15:29:37] <%Serenade212> Is it the big patch or just for the event and minor updates?
[2023-01-05 15:29:46] <+vaniitas4> @EfnMD what is the difference in the armor ?
[2023-01-05 15:29:53] <%+a1pharu> best supp character to rank up this patch?

[2023-01-05 15:30:00] <vergil_hc> if brig got Overarmor back. like she had back in the day. she would be a beast. paired with queen
[2023-01-05 15:30:01] <Nivaku> Where are the patch notes?
[2023-01-05 15:30:03] <%enreves> Give JQ a bit more damage and make her axe swing faster
[2023-01-05 15:30:05] <vergil_hc> that would be ultra fun xD
[2023-01-05 15:30:10] <%Pkkspiral> They need to stop Pharah taking damage from her bombs. That, or let her descend quickly like they did in Experimental.
[2023-01-05 15:30:11] <+EfnMD> @EfnMD Essentially gives more surviveability
[2023-01-05 15:30:13] <Peekiimon> @serenade212 we don‚Äôt know

[2023-01-05 15:30:34] <%nakano_10> Morning Emongg and chat <3
[2023-01-05 15:30:36] <Coffeesforlosers> I think kiriko and zen are my fav supports rn
[2023-01-05 15:30:42] <megaspectr> Pretty sure Junkerqueen was op in the alpha because of shout, and dive comps
[2023-01-05 15:30:43] <%enreves> Nobody wants Joats
[2023-01-05 15:30:46] <Bythisgirl> NinjaGrumpy
[2023-01-05 15:30:50] <%+shiftypigeons> They need to give her a oneshot combo & a 350hp self heal with a 50% dmg reduction
[2023-01-05 15:30:51] <+vaniitas4> @Pkkspiral instead I think they need to make junkrat takes damage from his shots and mines
[2023-01-05 15:30:55] <%$TharVGM> as much as I like her, kiriko probably gonna get nerfed no?
[2023-01-05 15:30:58] <vergil_hc> @enreves queen does not need more damage. you pretty much delete squishys once ur near them
[2023-01-05 15:31:00] <Bythisgirl> I love ninja NinjaGrumpy
[2023-01-05 15:31:13] <vergil_hc> queen needs to be more brawly. she has enough damage xD
[2023-01-05 15:31:13] <ogkushkilla02> Nerf the shields from CS but lower the cooldown?
[2023-01-05 15:31:23] <%Pkkspiral> @Pkkspiral Yeah, he throws too much too quickly with no repercussion
[2023-01-05 15:31:26] <Bythisgirl> CoolStoryBob

[2023-01-05 15:32:24] <+vaniitas4> oh, I was thinking im having bugs in my games
[2023-01-05 15:32:27] <vergil_hc> if they nuke hog today. i'll have more fun in comp for sure
[2023-01-05 15:32:40] <vergil_hc> while im not so sure matra is in a balanced spot RN
[2023-01-05 15:32:40] <%enreves> @vergil_hc Not really true if the enemy supports have hands
[2023-01-05 15:32:52] <MarioMadness64> Eemong made me love playing sig and jq, practice helped me climb to masters!
[2023-01-05 15:32:55] <vergil_hc> in lower SR matra just destroys. because people tend to run away from his ult
[2023-01-05 15:33:12] <mrwang30> Whats the update today?
[2023-01-05 15:33:18] <megaspectr> I don‚Äôt think hog‚Äôs that strong, it‚Äôs just the kiriko hog combo that‚Äôs too strong. It‚Äôs hard to balance that
[2023-01-05 15:33:32] <%$LeWitcher> Just delete Hog for a time YEPPERS

[2023-01-05 15:33:40] <%arcanevagrant> @megaspectr just increase hook cd
[2023-01-05 15:33:56] <%arcanevagrant> or all his cd tbh

[2023-01-05 15:34:03] <vergil_hc> there is almost no running away from matra tho. xD
[2023-01-05 15:34:09] <Peekiimon> I thought they wanted to nerf him first and then soft rework him later in the month
[2023-01-05 15:34:17] <ogkushkilla02> Running away w Lucio or sum is the best way to counter that or sleep
[2023-01-05 15:34:19] <vergil_hc> with a lucio on his team, its impossible to run away xD
[2023-01-05 15:34:24] <megaspectr> You could sleep him boop him or seperate him with shields
[2023-01-05 15:34:36] <+shadowelmsy> is this quick play or comp
[2023-01-05 15:34:45] <megaspectr> Hook him, or hog ult him
[2023-01-05 15:34:48] <megaspectr> It‚Äôs qp
[2023-01-05 15:34:48] <vergil_hc> i tend to play winton against matra. as soon as he ults i just pop primal and take him for a ride

[2023-01-05 15:41:30] <vergil_hc> @McNugNug if you had a bad game. take a small break. top 500 players have qeue times of 10+ minutes. so they have enough downtime between games xD

[2023-01-05 15:42:17] <mrwang30> Havent played brig in so long. So if you just swing your hammer around your teammates you heal them, is that right?

[2023-01-05 15:42:26] <+vaniitas4> there is a brig rework ?
[2023-01-05 15:42:31] <+pastashel> can hog vape while purple?

[2023-01-05 15:42:33] <vergil_hc> @McNugNug im a ~plat player. and i tend to take breaks of 7-10 minutes after games. so that i dont tilt xD

[2023-01-05 15:42:50] <biak911> maybe they should give brig more shield packs
[2023-01-05 15:42:55] <megaspectr> @mrwang30 each hit that connects gives an area of healing around her basically
[2023-01-05 15:42:55] <vergil_hc> @McNugNug and in plat its very easy to get tilted xD
[2023-01-05 15:43:03] <ogkushkilla02> Nano brig goes hard
[2023-01-05 15:43:05] <megaspectr> If you don‚Äôt hit anyone you won‚Äôt heal anyone
[2023-01-05 15:43:08] <AstroElio> @lorddikusmaximus What if they‚Äôre all scattered tho üíî
[2023-01-05 15:43:10] <neppunepp> my brig ult idea. she becomes release brig for 5 seconds
[2023-01-05 15:43:15] <vergil_hc> @ogkushkilla02 Kitsune + brig ‚ô•
[2023-01-05 15:43:22] <%+McNugNug> @vergil_hc I've found switching up my role helps too, switching mindsets helps reset tilt as well
[2023-01-05 15:43:35] <$AosaMimosa> Brig with 225 HP seems reasonable to me, or is that broken?
[2023-01-05 15:43:45] <vergil_hc> @McNugNug true

[2023-01-05 15:44:10] <vergil_hc> @AosaMimosa nah. brig is hella tanky as she is rn
[2023-01-05 15:44:18] <mrwang30> maybe zen was the play

[2023-01-05 15:45:07] <%Serenade212> I wonder if they change the hog one shot to make it so the team has to shoot you, not hog (e.g., hog hooks you in and holds you for .5-1s or something and can't shoot).

[2023-01-05 15:54:39] <biak911> necrotic orb made Moira less effective
[2023-01-05 15:54:45] <+Ssnizzle> Smart and Moira in the same sentence? LUL
[2023-01-05 15:54:47] <Geagiteerd> @vaniitas4 same but i feel like they would have said something already if the patch was today
[2023-01-05 15:55:06] <%Curtsy> It was pretty poorly received, it obviously wasn't the play LuL
[2023-01-05 15:55:07] <megaspectr> Maybe give her damahe orb less damage and more slow?
[2023-01-05 15:55:09] <%Serenade212> Moira feels fine now, a little weak if anything. Was super frustrating when I first started though LUL
[2023-01-05 15:55:11] <+lazorbheemz> ughh 3 hours till new event
[2023-01-05 15:55:12] <+maktrophies> so the gave moira damage reduction and kiri invulnerability

[2023-01-05 15:55:23] <biak911> and if they return necrotic orb, kiriko could just cleanse

[2023-01-05 15:55:27] <+blackxshinobi> Moira not effective as is now. Except low elo where ppl can‚Äôt aim

[2023-01-05 15:55:55] <$AosaMimosa> Have Blizzard patched the being able to TP while ulting as Orisa? Or is that still a possible play?
[2023-01-05 15:55:56] <+Hydrate_km> maybe just give ther current orb a mildly enfeemle effect when it's attached/doing damage.

[2023-01-05 15:59:06] <%+McNugNug> @geen_naamnl hog is a problem because of one shots and minimal counterplay, and same for sojourn, but in a weird way, i think widow is ok, albeit still not great but yeah, hog sojourn widow makes for a terrible match
[2023-01-05 15:59:16] <+shadowtail24> how are you jumping in the phase shift?
[2023-01-05 15:59:20] <%$xjedininjax> The ticking noise from the damage orb is very addicting and could be a big reason fps Moira is so popular.
[2023-01-05 15:59:21] <+lazorbheemz> you know its baad when flats has better healing on moira
[2023-01-05 15:59:21] <%+Bumpy1031> yellow orb must be from this skin.

[2023-01-05 16:03:04] <AniSkywalker> @Emongg a lot of people in the deathmatch help each other out by completing the challenges. Is that not ok to do as a streamer?
[2023-01-05 16:03:05] <mrwang30> Have you caught a sno ball yet in meis sno ball offensive?

[2023-01-05 16:03:29] <crossy_turtles> I think Moira is a good hero but the players make her annoying

[2023-01-05 16:05:59] <%+Cr4zy_MrKing> Personal, opinion I think ravenous vortex should have infinite vertical range so it can actually pull flying character down

[2023-01-05 16:08:47] <baldinho_> nerf his damage and give him 2 hook charges, so he can 2 shoot instead :)

[2023-01-05 16:08:48] <%Zhombiefood> I think it would be fine if they kept the 1 shot, but make it harder to pull off in some way, but still make it fun and effective in some way even if you fail the 1 shot
[2023-01-05 16:08:49] <asuna_122700> you can get out of hogs shot with almost any hero if you use them right

[2023-01-05 16:09:15] <mrwang30> Whats the event?
[2023-01-05 16:09:18] <PineappleCoco> Prayge sojourn nerfs?

[2023-01-05 16:09:44] <ivnrg_> 7 minutes of searching a match? How do you still play the game like that
[2023-01-05 16:09:47] <$tatersalad__> I think flats had the best idea for a rework of hog where his job is to use his hook to get ez kills for his team not him @emongg
[2023-01-05 16:09:49] <%Zhombiefood> I'm calling it -- they're getting rid of roadhogs gun and giving him 2 hooks
[2023-01-05 16:09:50] <+Yanderae_> do you think dva is in a good spot right now or do you think she needs a buff/nerf?
[2023-01-05 16:09:56] <PineappleCoco> @enreves COPIUM oof
[2023-01-05 16:09:57] <+herpesfreesince3> @megaspectr Oh I see. I think its hard to know because I HIGHLY doubt theyll simply remove his 1-shot but leave everything else the same. Id think theyd give/change something else to give him a new identity. We'll see
[2023-01-05 16:10:06] <MashNL> In my elo i love when they taking Sojourn. They cant aim anyway

[2023-01-05 16:10:56] <critzyqt> what if they hook the person on the spot not to hik
[2023-01-05 16:11:00] <jackbro95840> Dang 8 minute wait
[2023-01-05 16:11:00] <critzyqt> him
[2023-01-05 16:11:05] <%Zhombiefood> is hog in the game mode they're releasing today?  I bet they'll take some stuff from that and try to implement it somehow
[2023-01-05 16:11:05] <%+dookin0nya> I meant like a whole kit rework
[2023-01-05 16:11:10] <ivnrg_> why don't they Nerf the x2 headshot an give him like x1'5 and a little less body shot damage so it doesn't one shot that easily or just doesn't?
[2023-01-05 16:11:14] <blub69696969> suffering from success with these queue times
[2023-01-05 16:11:22] <%shavus88> Remove the one shot - take away his heal, and let him send some percentage of damage he takes to his hooked target
[2023-01-05 16:11:25] <+BradDawg33> What if it was a swung people instead of pulling them
[2023-01-05 16:11:34] <mrwang30> like tank queues
[2023-01-05 16:11:39] <+ech0cide> anytime they've taken hog's one shot away, he becomes trash tier
[2023-01-05 16:11:41] <thy_tk> Nerf the hook it reaches across the map for 20 meters that be better than just at least for the one shot
[2023-01-05 16:11:41] <%+Cr4zy_MrKing> As much as ramattra doesn't need a buff, part of me wants to see vortex get changed so it can actually impede enemies more. I don't think it would be too unreasonable to have the vortex have infinite range vertically unless blocked by like a roof. At least then it could bother the flying heroes
[2023-01-05 16:11:46] <tuhinmalOW> is new patch Doomfist buff only I care about because people always complains when you play as Doomfist tank
[2023-01-05 16:11:46] <megaspectr> Mei and bastion rework were run, man bastion sucked
[2023-01-05 16:11:46] <%Healerswrath_> its good that doom oneshot has been removed tho
[2023-01-05 16:11:48] <+maktrophies> did you see the bowie shatter where he got booped three times then hooked so his ult didn't land?
[2023-01-05 16:11:48] <vergil_hc> they said they wanted to rework hog in the long run, but nuke him short term. didnt they?
[2023-01-05 16:11:50] <%Zhombiefood> wait until 10 Madge

[2023-01-05 16:16:13] <vergil_hc> well. they could also do something hook related with his ult. and change whole hog into a short burst ability. like imagine his ult being "you press Q on a target. and they get hooked and bound to you a few seconds. so that you can carry them on your back" that would be hella fun

[2023-01-05 16:21:11] <+azashiro_> theres no reason for casuals to play ranked. no OW coins no skins no lootboxes as rewards, but you get a gold ugn

[2023-01-05 17:33:39] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-05 17:59:12] <FTBlades> @Magic_Amys_Panties Widow is the one character I would want removed from the game. Adds nothing to the game imo, just not fun to have in a lobby

[2023-01-05 18:00:33] <%+tm_901> i get they want to rework him but why not slightly adjust him in the meantime

[2023-01-05 18:39:32] <@%^StreamElements> My favorite streamer is the Emongg guy. he is very powerfull. his special "road to masters" honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two face cams and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a joke.

I'm hoping what they did for the Cyclops, with them changing their size, might make way for a size-shifting hero!

[2023-01-05 20:32:38] <Barkh4n> it's cause they're adding it to the wound
[2023-01-05 20:32:38] <%Smoozert> the 30 dmg removed was added as a wound

[2023-01-05 20:32:57] <joedatomato> Pretty sure there was like a 12 damage wound before
[2023-01-05 20:32:57] <DzilOne> but its still bad because it doesn't kill and they can just heal the wound
[2023-01-05 20:33:02] <+aaymon86> ...But the healing is still so low
[2023-01-05 20:33:07] <%SirTryhard7> Right emongHmm

[2023-01-05 20:33:40] <%+tm_901> JQ is so fun already
[2023-01-05 20:33:40] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-05 20:33:56] <%PBJammy> I like the changes feeling like you're being rewarded for good play
[2023-01-05 20:33:57] <!blizz_winter> @HellraiserMX Sort of, you can't cleanse the bleeds off of dead allies. :)

[2023-01-05 20:34:14] <gluedballs> Disappointing amount of changes. no acknowledgement of hog, Hanzo, or sojourn
[2023-01-05 20:34:14] <Ranrokk> Can you get up to 5 wounds on a single target now? Impact bleed, return bleed, quick melee, carnage, ult?  Probably super tight timing but that is a lot of bleed.

[2023-01-05 20:40:24] <%+Cr4zy_MrKing> Do we have clarification on if the junker queen passive heal changes makes it so you regen the 4emaining wound damage even after they die, or if all of the healing is applied at once when they die? Because those are two very different things.

[2023-01-05 20:52:29] <SteroOO> Moira will still need her healing orb for burst healing. So I don't think, the change is an issue.
[2023-01-05 20:52:29] <theMoSchmo> bro like how did that one change make her so good its crazy.
[2023-01-05 20:52:31] <%poogyboy> 1 healing not bad
[2023-01-05 20:52:32] <ShanghaiKid81> JQ has more sustainability now I take it

[2023-01-05 20:54:17] <certainly_not_a_robot> @xanfal33 knife axe melee
[2023-01-05 20:54:19] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> elimination doesn't stop bleeding heal so healing up time now is longer than before
[2023-01-05 20:54:20] <BabyLoaf102> 2 with knife, 1 with carnage, 1 with melee, 1 with ult for a total of 5 i think
[2023-01-05 20:54:23] <YisKuri> @Voldominator lollllllllllll
[2023-01-05 20:54:25] <%xAnfal33> @certainly_not_a_robot ooooh

[2023-01-05 20:54:37] <%+hoopla369> Why they buff zarya
[2023-01-05 20:54:39] <%Gusta36> yeah the sustain seems better
[2023-01-05 20:54:41] <%+Linsinco> you are insane with these changes
[2023-01-05 20:54:45] <BADdimplz> @lbj3333 practice
[2023-01-05 20:54:46] <%xxx_narf_xxx> when you kill someone with wound the healing is instant
[2023-01-05 20:54:47] <Jonnycake> i'm excited to play her after work
[2023-01-05 20:54:51] <exartclubmember> Whoaaa she seems‚Ä¶ viable?
[2023-01-05 20:54:54] <%Gusta36> @hoopla369 zarya's been trash since the nerf
[2023-01-05 20:54:55] <IceKingXXII> Anybody know if you can heal through and anti with bleed?
[2023-01-05 20:54:59] <rossanpark12> Does the cooldown get less than 6 seconds?
[2023-01-05 20:55:01] <%GoGoGarrett> her ult sems to suck
[2023-01-05 20:55:03] <+DeatheyeHC> @Emongg can you do a 360¬∞ with E like Reinhardts melee?
[2023-01-05 20:55:04] <+Draco9158> we love mei ult Kappa
[2023-01-05 20:55:05] <$Ribz4Lunch> @Emongg when you kill them the remaining wound healing is instant, not over time
[2023-01-05 20:55:08] <hellodere1> that sustain seems crazy now
[2023-01-05 20:55:08] <%Smoozert> it's better than keeping the healing over time on kill, it instantly gives you the remaining healing amount on kill
[2023-01-05 20:55:10] <%ne0n_black> @IceKingXXII caint
[2023-01-05 20:55:12] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> purple HP stops bleeding heal, it seems
[2023-01-05 20:55:14] <Thefuriousducky> @IceKingXXII you can't

[2023-01-05 20:55:27] <%zonar_ow> do you think she'll be good now or not until hog is nerfed?

[2023-01-05 20:55:37] <%+baggadyx> Carnage ult is down two seconds per target hit. So if you hit two targets, it's -4 seconds to 4 seconds cooldown. Hit 4 targets and it's 0 second cooldown.
[2023-01-05 20:55:37] <woodbirdchain> @Voldominator gahd damn
[2023-01-05 20:55:43] <%Smoozert> yes, so it rewards going for kills

[2023-01-05 20:58:32] <certainly_not_a_robot> Hog still outheals by like two to three times

[2023-01-05 20:58:44] <the_rock287> !patch notes
[2023-01-05 20:58:45] <SlaterCM> JQ is a interesting design
[2023-01-05 20:58:47] <Janek1991> @allenboyhs Yes 1 game withJQ and 1 with rein
[2023-01-05 20:58:47] <%PBJammy> with the JQ hitbox increase, genji can get so much ult charge. nerf genji
[2023-01-05 20:58:48] <weboremerald> imagine how fun lucio jq is now with carnage
[2023-01-05 20:58:49] <%widowmakre> LOL
[2023-01-05 20:58:50] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> i think genji's damage out put is way lower than it should now
[2023-01-05 20:58:50] <kleo_online> How did they buff JK?
[2023-01-05 20:58:51] <$Aceattack> orisa vs rein is a no skill matchup. no outplay potential :(
[2023-01-05 20:58:53] <BADdimplz> @BDubya1 ????
[2023-01-05 20:58:56] <m3l1ssa2000> Genji‚Äôs still strong tho lol
[2023-01-05 20:58:56] <+casualperry> maybe I can actually play jq in comp now
[2023-01-05 20:58:58] <c0ok1_e> everything but his ult is good to me
[2023-01-05 20:58:58] <+lazorbheemz> yeah just tried the new mode it sucks and already have the mercy skin lol
[2023-01-05 20:59:00] <+Draco9158> genji is able to hop around too much, so now he has a 15 second cooldown between double jumps
[2023-01-05 20:59:00] <Kevtaru> Genji can still do damage and get kills needs to be reworked/nerfed some more
[2023-01-05 20:59:01] <+Invenian> NODDERS Preentive Genji nerfs incase he becomes meta one day
[2023-01-05 20:59:02] <allenboyhs> @janonymous thanks

[2023-01-05 21:03:40] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-05 21:03:58] <+grimseal> is she too good?! xD
[2023-01-05 21:04:01] <%+baggadyx> You're almost outhealing enemy support.
[2023-01-05 21:04:03] <+Necrosythe> More healing also means less resources from your healers and more support for your teammates
[2023-01-05 21:04:05] <Chizzle81> At this rate you are going to get Genji nerfed
[2023-01-05 21:04:06] <electricforce_> !drops
[2023-01-05 21:04:08] <%octernion> similar healing to their hog
[2023-01-05 21:04:10] <VyrusHasDied> they gon have to revert the 1.25x buff lmaoooo
[2023-01-05 21:04:11] <+vaniitas4> my favorite thing is hog getting bullied
[2023-01-05 21:04:11] <+sirpellpell> this is open queue lol there's an inherent difference in skill too guys
[2023-01-05 21:04:13] <marsboer> Brigitte: only 250 to 300 hp. I wish she had better buff
[2023-01-05 21:04:13] <%octernion> who admittedly is dead most of the time
[2023-01-05 21:04:14] <Gerald_OW> You're almost keeping up with hog lol
[2023-01-05 21:04:14] <ShauniJen> Competing with Hog healwise
[2023-01-05 21:04:15] <DrHaydees> This right here is a guide on playing Junker Queen after the buff
[2023-01-05 21:04:15] <%AwkwardHillbilly> @watermalown 4 man means no CD -2 seconds for each person hit max CD of 8

[2023-01-05 21:04:21] <+flavortown500> this is the best genji nerf ever
[2023-01-05 21:04:23] <%+joegq0220> You have 25% ult charge b4 your ults over, thats a little broke @emongg
[2023-01-05 21:04:24] <+aaymon86> It's not Hog levels, but it's noticable
[2023-01-05 21:04:26] <%urban69ing08> you're healing for like 1/8 dmg done before was like 1/14
[2023-01-05 21:04:28] <+spigzy8> EMONGG!!!
[2023-01-05 21:04:31] <Janek1991> @marsboer SHield is a LOT bigger now
[2023-01-05 21:04:39] <+Jellybee85> overtuned. JQ meta begins
[2023-01-05 21:04:39] <+m0therlode> it's like a berserker, the more she gets hurt, the wilder she gets
[2023-01-05 21:04:41] <%madkiller92> with this buff JQ gonna be fun to play

[2023-01-05 21:04:58] <+Invenian> Oh no the brawling heroe can brawl now guess we will need to nerf Genji again
[2023-01-05 21:05:02] <Santusak> yo, wtf is the new event? probably the worst event in OW I remember peepoDaHeck
[2023-01-05 21:05:03] <%+dookin0nya> did you not like the new game mode?
[2023-01-05 21:05:04] <%chompchomp8> so how is new JQ?
[2023-01-05 21:05:04] <+TheDustyDoge> @emongg how does the -1s per hit on carnage feel?
[2023-01-05 21:05:05] <+Akajayjay1> Carnage works on the shield as well? @Emongg
[2023-01-05 21:05:10] <%Smoozert> i think so
[2023-01-05 21:05:11] <+Necrosythe> yeah

[2023-01-05 21:05:13] <%+notG10> yes
[2023-01-05 21:05:14] <+maddthemadd> yes
[2023-01-05 21:05:14] <%+nothinggood27> yes
[2023-01-05 21:05:15] <ly_yng> yeah you should, I think
[2023-01-05 21:05:15] <+DeatheyeHC> guess so yes
[2023-01-05 21:05:15] <raiemuss> i think yeah
[2023-01-05 21:05:15] <+aaymon86> I'd imagine so
[2023-01-05 21:05:16] <VyrusHasDied> yeah
[2023-01-05 21:05:19] <%madkiller92> yeah think so
[2023-01-05 21:05:21] <%Salty_Scot> I'd guess so, yeah
[2023-01-05 21:05:23] <%+notG10> whatever left over healing at time of death regardless on how they die
[2023-01-05 21:05:24] <marsboer> @Janek1991 oh? i will test her
[2023-01-05 21:05:25] <herewegoagainbby> prob same as genji
[2023-01-05 21:05:28] <+aaymon86> I think that's why you're getting more healing
[2023-01-05 21:05:29] <ShanghaiKid81> "Now heals for the remaining wound damage when an enemy dies with wounds on them"
[2023-01-05 21:05:29] <%+notG10> so like falling in a hole counts
[2023-01-05 21:05:38] <%widowmakre> huge carnage
[2023-01-05 21:05:39] <VyrusHasDied> FIRST DEATH
[2023-01-05 21:05:42] <Mozzrom> yes, pretty sure patch notes said if a character dies with the bleed, you instant heal
[2023-01-05 21:05:42] <%R1L3Y_98> First death this game. emongKEK
[2023-01-05 21:05:42] <+Necrosythe> it's like total mayhem
[2023-01-05 21:05:44] <+aaymon86> Cause before you'd lose out on the bleed if they die

[2023-01-05 21:06:13] <H4ppyhunter> JQ is brokes, as long as you don't brake the handrails.
[2023-01-05 21:06:14] <+aaymon86> So the more they die, the more burst healing you get.

[2023-01-05 21:10:40] <lucas46g> I worked out the math and the zarya change gives her an average energy increase of roughly 10% so about 10 extra average dps

[2023-01-05 21:13:17] <+Red__Rain> @ZeoBishop actually if u just stand close enough and not break them, u get an insta cool down

[2023-01-05 21:29:54] <VikingKong_> brig didn't need a big buff anyway
[2023-01-05 21:29:54] <ChristianSharkTV> @lady_reign_ Carnage cooldown goes down by two for each enemy hit & she gets the wound heal regardless of if the enemy dies or not
[2023-01-05 21:29:57] <+Riboku__> They should increase brig health to 250 not her shield lol
[2023-01-05 21:30:01] <lateyr> That carnage buff is crazy
[2023-01-05 21:30:03] <TOSwtkm> now junker queen is some one playable again a roadhog

[2023-01-05 21:30:55] <%+docrooz> Do things like Kirko cleanse or Zarya bubble remove the bleed or only the purple from her ult?
[2023-01-05 21:30:59] <lateyr> Hog rework is later this month I think
[2023-01-05 21:31:05] <natenigh> Do wounds stack on Junker Queen? What about 2 melee attacks?

[2023-01-05 21:38:10] <%Presarius712> it went to 6 secs so you hit something lmao
[2023-01-05 21:38:10] <%zonar_ow> what's the tp change?
[2023-01-05 21:38:15] <+B_A_29> @couchbard they've said numerous times the Hog fixes are coming mid/late jan
[2023-01-05 21:38:16] <Crooshka> @couchbard just play ana
[2023-01-05 21:38:17] <joedatomato> @joedatomato Idk specifics cause I don't play the hero but there were some on Sym
[2023-01-05 21:38:20] <WV_COAL> whats the bugs?
[2023-01-05 21:38:26] <angelbobaz> the poor tracer
[2023-01-05 21:38:28] <Augmented_1> wait did that tracer rewind onto her bomb?
[2023-01-05 21:38:28] <%SoTropics> How much were venom mines buffed?
[2023-01-05 21:38:30] <+Necrosythe> she can just outheal ram ult damage
[2023-01-05 21:38:30] <joedatomato> That was a few patches ago tho
[2023-01-05 21:38:38] <Slushy_Queen> why is everyone assuming its a bug,  maybe they forgot to include it in the patch notes
[2023-01-05 21:38:40] <xenotaylor> I believe JQ gets reduced cooldowns on Sym turrets
[2023-01-05 21:38:40] <stewstewstewtv> why he hate grandpa peepoSad
[2023-01-05 21:38:41] <TensorOW> @couchbard Either they rushed to finish the patch before holidays to have it ready to ship, or they're rusty after vacation and messed up lol
[2023-01-05 21:38:41] <+Necrosythe> JQ hard counter ram ult lmao
[2023-01-05 21:38:42] <%jayflat> But apparently destructible walls and friendly mei walls also work
[2023-01-05 21:38:43] <couchbard> it doesnt matter if changes are coming hes been a menace for this long give the community something to help until the rework
[2023-01-05 21:38:47] <Perstriction> HeyGuys
[2023-01-05 21:38:50] <stefan_breyt> had he already do the new mode or is it even there?
[2023-01-05 21:39:01] <sekenoo> Will junker queen be playable in comp now? Master and grandmasters
[2023-01-05 21:39:03] <%Nennai> @stefan_breyt its in arcade
[2023-01-05 21:39:04] <+Necrosythe> @Slushy_Queen because the other way around is 90% more likely. especially when every single other movement effect like hers cleanses
[2023-01-05 21:39:09] <M3YO_> JQ gets reduced CD from breakable walls
[2023-01-05 21:39:18] <%N30NxL1T3x> @jayflat the real jayflat ml7Bino
[2023-01-05 21:39:20] <+Zombi3pinup> carnage cooldown can be infinate if you hit a rein and brig shielding. shields and destructables count as "enemies" for the -2 cd reduction
[2023-01-05 21:39:20] <couchbard> The "changes are coming" excuse is bad. Leaving him in a blatantly unbalanced state is not good
[2023-01-05 21:39:25] <Augmented_1> how did they break kiri tp
[2023-01-05 21:39:27] <stefan_breyt> @nennai thanks any good?
[2023-01-05 21:39:28] <+m0therlode> ggs
[2023-01-05 21:39:29] <+Zombi3pinup> it also works on friendly mei wall
[2023-01-05 21:39:29] <yaycuzz> Junker Queen is bae
[2023-01-05 21:39:32] <JonahP_572> hype
[2023-01-05 21:39:35] <Slushy_Queen> @Slushy_Queen i'd say its 50/50,  people mess up writing notes every day
[2023-01-05 21:39:36] <+Zombi3pinup> you can get infinate carnage
[2023-01-05 21:39:39] <joedatomato> @Slushy_Queen Yeah at the very least it should cleanse DoTs as an escape ability.  Idrc about status effects
[2023-01-05 21:39:42] <Slushy_Queen> people are mistakes

[2023-01-05 21:39:52] <xenotaylor> Junker Queen gets reduced cooldown on carnage if she hits destructible walls or Mei Walls (ally or enemy) as well as some other entities  Kiriko no longer Clenses herself with swift step, so  anti doesn‚Äôt get cleaned, nor bleed

[2023-01-05 21:45:49] <dxxbr_> is jq good now?
[2023-01-05 21:45:49] <+binagin> LETS F-ing GO! HANZO META INCOMING
[2023-01-05 21:45:49] <lateyr> JQ op
[2023-01-05 21:45:50] <%schteven> does hitting mei wall count as multiple enemies, because it‚Äôs technically multiple objects???
[2023-01-05 21:45:52] <%N30NxL1T3x> dude started playing ow tomorrow üíÄ
[2023-01-05 21:45:54] <ow_sigmaeats> And last question did they fix the Hanzo bug

[2023-01-05 21:46:02] <FrostyMcFreeze> back to back axe??
[2023-01-05 21:46:11] <%JustSwufty> @ow_sigmaeats yea
[2023-01-05 21:46:15] <+m0therlode> jordan's the wild card
[2023-01-05 21:46:16] <Matosere> You people realize if u get rid of road hogs one shot ability he‚Äôs useless
[2023-01-05 21:46:20] <lateyr> She gets axe back so fast now
[2023-01-05 21:46:20] <%Nennai> @stefan_breyt NODDERS emongg had the red customization in in the gamemode
[2023-01-05 21:46:25] <%+TutkunDuzgun> you have to try in in base
[2023-01-05 21:46:28] <%zonar_ow> @Matosere yes. that's the point
[2023-01-05 21:46:34] <FrostyMcFreeze> did he just use axe twice in a row
[2023-01-05 21:46:42] <%+BigKingManatee> cool down for axe is reduced by 2 sec per person hit
[2023-01-05 21:46:46] <+InuRobot> Just give Road a snare ability on hitting 75% of pellets, still makes him dangerous to peak on
[2023-01-05 21:46:46] <+Professor_T96> What changes did she get?
[2023-01-05 21:46:48] <stinglul> i wish theyd increase the hitbox of her knife tho its so small D:
[2023-01-05 21:46:54] <Matosere> Hog has been the same for quite a while now idk why people are only complaining now lmao
[2023-01-05 21:46:56] <+poppa_koala> @frostymcfreeze Reduces cooldown by a second for every enemy it hits now
[2023-01-05 21:46:58] <chaseman123> I'd rather gut hog's healing than remove the one shot
[2023-01-05 21:47:00] <drdonutface> @matosere no he becomes a displacement tank which is far more interesting for the game
[2023-01-05 21:47:02] <%+Smithy6482> I do love monkaTOS
[2023-01-05 21:47:04] <%Blackdima4> Nah hog can still punish people out of position without it being a boring ass 1 shot
[2023-01-05 21:47:04] <+Ssnizzle> @zonar_ow @Matosere They removed hog's 1 shot combo in the past, and it was a BAD decision. They're not going to do that again.

[2023-01-05 21:47:18] <+felds> @Matosere he's still tanky af with the ability to self heal, and he also can separate enemies from the group for easier kills
[2023-01-05 21:47:19] <FrostyMcFreeze> darn
[2023-01-05 21:47:22] <r0xc> emongHUGE

[2023-01-05 21:47:24] <Matosere> @drdonutface no he does not he will not be picked anymore there‚Äôs far better tanks at that point
[2023-01-05 21:47:26] <%Smoozert> you got so much healing from those kills lol
[2023-01-05 21:47:26] <%Nennai> why did we here the friently ult line

[2023-01-05 21:47:42] <+InuRobot> that bap loves his Widow
[2023-01-05 21:47:47] <%Shrain> she definitely in a way better spot, maybe not exactly the meta pick
[2023-01-05 21:47:49] <%JustSwufty> Displacement Tank is a interesting concept..
[2023-01-05 21:47:52] <JonahP_572> monkaW

[2023-01-05 21:48:16] <Matosere> @felds it doesn‚Äôt really matter how tanky he is the whole concept of picking him to get picks Is gone that‚Äôs what makes him viable.
[2023-01-05 21:48:17] <lateyr> Carnage buff too strong?
[2023-01-05 21:48:29] <%Nennai> @stefan_breyt yeah, -2seconds on carnage cd per target hit, and knife has 3 wounds now, plus extended heals

[2023-01-05 21:48:36] <aspireowl> @Matosere respectfully disagree
[2023-01-05 21:48:39] <$Âà•„ÅÆÊ∞∏ÈÅ† (sleepycvctus)> @Ssnizzle I mean they've already said he's getting nerfed then reworked lol
[2023-01-05 21:48:39] <%+TutkunDuzgun> it was around 500 at most

[2023-01-05 21:49:01] <Matosere> @aspireowl what would u do to nerf hog and still make him viable ?
[2023-01-05 21:49:02] <+Nessfalco> damn this looks fun
[2023-01-05 21:49:04] <+ShadyLee> Emongg is playing quick play too not like it ranked

[2023-01-05 21:49:10] <%Donovaan_OW> Do heal packs end the bleed?
[2023-01-05 21:49:17] <+Ssnizzle> @Âà•„ÅÆÊ∞∏ÈÅ† sure, but the "nerf" will not include removing his 1 shot combo. He'll just be completely reworked.,
[2023-01-05 21:49:17] <%moby675> they still havent nerfed hog really
[2023-01-05 21:49:38] <+jasonwocky> @SonicBoom113 yes when it hits destructible objects like railings and turrets it counts for the reduced cooldown
[2023-01-05 21:49:43] <stinglul> double E PogU
[2023-01-05 21:49:45] <aspireowl> @Matosere thats a really good question..me personally i would add 2 seonds to his self heal cool down
[2023-01-05 21:49:47] <Bbistheman21> you still get cooldown off deflect lmao
[2023-01-05 21:49:48] <Battlejuicer> @moby675 maybe it's enough to change the meta though

[2023-01-05 21:50:15] <bofaoyl> @moby675 they figured that moira player needed another reason not to heal. its more important.....

[2023-01-05 21:50:23] <+jasonwocky> @SonicBoom113 yeah it's obviously unintended but it's gonna happen a lot even accidentally and make that cooldown lower than it should be

[2023-01-05 22:24:49] <aurelion_ow> I gotta feeling shes still not gonna be too good but at least she doesnt seem like a total throw pick anymore maybe. After maybe changes to HOG and some other heros she will likly feel heaps better
[2023-01-05 22:24:50] <na_TheDream> Playing Queen exploit?
[2023-01-05 22:24:53] <omendamien> @Emongg  you did good as queen that game

[2023-01-05 22:25:27] <%+Markymarc860> Brig gets buffed?
[2023-01-05 22:25:27] <+TacoKnight_> the new mode is ffa so its just bad by default
[2023-01-05 22:25:36] <+aaymon86> I think it was a good buff. Enough to propel her out of bad status. B tier at least I feel.
[2023-01-05 22:25:37] <DemonStrate86> @Emongg Wait wait wait. Did they not fix the Hanzo issue???
[2023-01-05 22:25:39] <animus9> seems like she still gets rolled by kiriko unfortunstely
[2023-01-05 22:25:43] <chromecaviar> @TacoKnight_ And filled with Hogs mostly
[2023-01-05 22:25:43] <@%AwCrap> @DemonStrate86 they did

[2023-01-05 22:25:52] <DemonStrate86> Oh, it wasn't in the notes.

[2023-01-05 22:26:30] <SweetVelosa> oh GOOD
[2023-01-05 22:26:31] <flamindude99> PepeHands They took away Hanzo's bowgun
[2023-01-05 22:26:31] <%Smoozert> that's a huge buff to hanzo there
[2023-01-05 22:26:34] <chromecaviar> @enzarous That's because they are going to buff him with 6 extra hooks
[2023-01-05 22:26:36] <glancemoons> Is there a clip of Emongg's thoughts if the JQ buffs are enough to make her viable?
[2023-01-05 22:26:40] <@%AwCrap> @enzarous they always said they're working on the soft rework and it'll come late season 2
[2023-01-05 22:26:41] <tylerdurden413> @Emongg are you aware of a widow glitch where you cant change her ads sense? or you can but then it gets reset back to 30 when you go back into the options
[2023-01-05 22:26:42] <aurelion_ow> @enzarous Same -_- games are so boring with him being good
[2023-01-05 22:26:44] <obbss20> it's fixed
[2023-01-05 22:26:46] <binsh> it was not a recoil .. Hanzo was having a seizure everytime he shot an arrow
[2023-01-05 22:26:52] <VikingKong_> you've not bee paying attention then @enzarous
[2023-01-05 22:26:53] <AnotherMeddler> So glad they fixed that
[2023-01-05 22:26:54] <flamindude99> Pog
[2023-01-05 22:27:03] <omendamien> so you can still pull them off the map

[2023-01-05 22:27:09] <+neesygg> im probably doing something wrong but the adrenaline rush doesnt continue to heal when an enemy dies with a wound like the patch said

[2023-01-05 22:30:10] <Battlejuicer> It think it's actually a sick buff
[2023-01-05 22:30:12] <+aaymon86> If you have fun playing it, that's all that matters.
[2023-01-05 22:30:12] <AThreeFootGiant> Holy shit
[2023-01-05 22:30:13] <DocSleepsZzZz> But if they give her more health then she pretty much won't die probably lol

[2023-01-05 22:30:17] <Battlejuicer> good choice
[2023-01-05 22:30:18] <%+Fenrisonic> honestly makes it easier to heal as Moira
[2023-01-05 22:30:19] <IsyBlaze> looked like a third
[2023-01-05 22:30:19] <prosol> What if you just used the heal orb instead?
[2023-01-05 22:30:21] <JCasper> Is that new cause I don't remember that giving anything back
[2023-01-05 22:30:22] <gameprey> always running out of heal juice
[2023-01-05 22:30:24] <stonedgandalf101> MOIRA buff?

[2023-01-05 22:30:38] <%TheBrontologist> thats actually huge lmao

[2023-01-05 22:30:48] <+skat3> not me thinking orb always restored her heal aimsSip
[2023-01-05 22:30:53] <DocSleepsZzZz> Lol
[2023-01-05 22:30:53] <%chompchomp8> why ever use healing orb kekDog
[2023-01-05 22:30:53] <thaaad> @ruckwon_thechef ah ty
[2023-01-05 22:30:54] <%+Fenrisonic> Heal Orb could for distance still, but now you can stand back and heal without getting into dangerous areas
[2023-01-05 22:31:01] <+aaymon86> They shouldve given it to both orbs imo.
[2023-01-05 22:31:01] <stinglul> @Mreignsupreme she legit the second worst support? HUH

[2023-01-05 22:31:15] <%+Fenrisonic> @aaymon86 how do you get healing back from healing though
[2023-01-05 22:31:24] <+the_coffee_owl> "They'll still probably feed"
[2023-01-05 22:31:28] <JCasper> @VikingKong_ Thanks I always thought she should be able to get heals back from the orb
[2023-01-05 22:31:28] <%N30NxL1T3x> moira did not get many miles per gallon
[2023-01-05 22:31:30] <+EvrynGrey> but its the whole idea of Moira...you have to do damage to heal
[2023-01-05 22:31:30] <stonedgandalf101> I‚Äôm already super fucking good with Moira

[2023-01-05 22:32:55] <%+Fenrisonic> @aaymon86 I use it all the time. long distance heals, aerial heals, or just when there is a skirmish happening for extra healing

[2023-01-05 22:33:22] <+fonttypeaaa> People who say moira is basic dont use her crazy fade jumps and orb bounces
[2023-01-05 22:33:31] <%Nennai> @Whatthecode peepoDaHeck wdym spoliers, idek what happened
[2023-01-05 22:33:38] <%+Fenrisonic> moira is about balance, yin and yang, so heal energy for healing orb doesnt really fit the idea
[2023-01-05 22:33:39] <@%Whatthecode> @Nennai PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 22:33:40] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-05 22:33:46] <+aaymon86> Oh for sure. Me too. Healing orb should be used more if your team requires healing.
[2023-01-05 22:33:56] <JCasper> @fonttypeaaa It's a lot easier to use in low ranks\
[2023-01-05 22:34:01] <%KevinKalani> @fonttypeaaa She's still pretty basic, just a bit more nuanced than people thing
[2023-01-05 22:34:03] <ekulinator> sick orisa skin
[2023-01-05 22:34:10] VIEWERS: 3¬†904
[2023-01-05 22:34:15] <%+Fenrisonic> getting energy back for dmg orb makes sense to her kit, and also allows you to contribute to damage whilst still hand-healing in skirmishes
[2023-01-05 22:34:16] <stinglul> nice mercy name FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-05 22:34:20] <$DatSpaceBoy> So if you hit four enemies you immediately get carnage again?
[2023-01-05 22:34:28] <OPALONTWITCH> yep
[2023-01-05 22:34:29] <+aaymon86> If they're full health, then by all means throw out the damage orb.
[2023-01-05 22:34:31] <xzxzxzxzxxxz> Gggggggggggg
[2023-01-05 22:34:44] <momonana_> How good is the queen buff?
[2023-01-05 22:34:45] <VikingKong_> yep monkaS @DatSpaceBoy
[2023-01-05 22:34:52] <JCasper> @OPALONTWITCH Are you saying yep to the 4 enemies hit and you get carnage question?
[2023-01-05 22:34:53] <%+Fenrisonic> @aaymon86 yup, and allows you to play safer behind your team as you don't need enemies close for the succ
[2023-01-05 22:35:21] <%wonkymonky_> enjoying the buffs? seagSMUSH
[2023-01-05 22:35:21] <+VentusWK> @DatSpaceBoy yep. I'm pretty sure this isn't intended but you can also hit shields to reduce it by 2 more seconds. So hitting shielding reins or brigs gives you a 4 sec cd.
[2023-01-05 22:35:25] <stonedgandalf101> Misses everything sword swipe
[2023-01-05 22:35:38] <$DatSpaceBoy> This is awesome. I love junkerqueen and I think relatively fair since kiriko could cleanse the first carnage
[2023-01-05 22:35:44] <buggyyboo> Kiriko is pretty hot

[2023-01-05 22:36:13] <CyberrrKitten> I expected more changes to JQ when they said "spicy changes"
[2023-01-05 22:36:15] <+flavortown500> @Culein_ genji nerfed into the ground
[2023-01-05 22:36:15] <UntoldTales> i think she needs a small speed boost during her axe swing to help chase down people
[2023-01-05 22:36:25] <SHiZOHD> JQ got a sword now?! PogChamp PogChamp
[2023-01-05 22:36:25] <+GoldClassGaming> @Culein_ Spicy JQ buffs, meh Zarya changes, slight Brig buff, slight Moira buff.

[2023-01-05 22:37:53] <+jasonwocky> its just insane how much focus fire she just converts into healer ult charge

[2023-01-05 22:38:01] <%zonar_ow> seems like she'll be good into pretty much anything other than orisa
[2023-01-05 22:38:01] <ItsDoffy> I feel like suzu should cleanse and stop like 3/4 dmg not all.
[2023-01-05 22:38:02] <wildcorndoghunter> patch came out today?
[2023-01-05 22:38:03] <%acekabogen_> would love to see kiriko's cleanse have a slightly smaller radius and a slightly shorter duration emongSmile
[2023-01-05 22:38:08] <%KevinKalani> The cool thing about getting the full heal from bleed if the enemy dies, is that it prompts a decision of whether or not to chase to follow up on a bleeding target, knowing that eliminating them will get you healed up

[2023-01-05 22:39:17] <+MistaKandyKane> Orisa has 3 abilites that can cancel JQ's ult or make it less effective smh
[2023-01-05 22:39:17] <%KevinKalani> @Culein_ slightly because she gets more heals...but I don't think she'll outperform the good tanks
[2023-01-05 22:39:21] <borborygmusattack> orisa boring? you can shoot people in the face and hard carry
[2023-01-05 22:39:23] <+BABOONGA> @Culein_ she heals a lot more now so yeah
[2023-01-05 22:39:28] <ghetto__bird> Orisa is out of control

[2023-01-05 22:43:20] <%+nothinggood27> wait.. did that just pull Gold? or did she just step on cart?
[2023-01-05 22:43:23] <+HiiiBear> horse still never died

[2023-01-05 22:43:47] <%+BobDoorbell> orisa annoying
[2023-01-05 22:43:47] <kashaa5a> only Symtra can beat Orisa
[2023-01-05 22:43:48] <flamindude99> Orisa the evergreen tank monkaW
[2023-01-05 22:43:58] <flamindude99> Get it; she's also green by default? Kappa
[2023-01-05 22:43:58] <ilovepooping12> Hi chat, what‚Äôs the most noticeable changes with the update? Thanks
[2023-01-05 22:44:02] <reagan__> jq is just a mini hog so it makes sense she is bad against orisa
[2023-01-05 22:44:03] <%KevinKalani> The only thing that JQ has against Orisa is that all of her shotgun pellets can hit Orisa's giant head
[2023-01-05 22:44:04] <%enreves> Blizzard shadow nerfed Widow slightly with the Medusa skin. Those snakes are so damn loud. You can hear her a mile away KEKW

[2023-01-05 22:44:49] <+aaymon86> Javeline being on a 6 second CD that cancels alot of abilities should get looked at imo

[2023-01-05 22:45:21] <%KevinKalani> @aaymon86 They had it on a longer cooldown and Orisa just felt crappy to play
[2023-01-05 22:45:31] <Epicwin0311> @ceehives Welcome back brudda

[2023-01-05 22:45:31] <%+bossmanbeard> so weird that helicopter blocks carnage
[2023-01-05 22:45:34] <%Culein_> Oh wow, orisa seems really strong vs the queen
[2023-01-05 22:45:39] <ItsDoffy> Efi Oladele has aged 5 years can she replace orisa now

[2023-01-05 22:45:58] <Epicwin0311> SHE GOT DELETED LUL
[2023-01-05 22:46:01] <%Nersicah> yep knife
[2023-01-05 22:46:01] <%Culein_> I think orisa is getting a lot stronger as people learned how to maximize her abilities
[2023-01-05 22:46:01] <%acekabogen_> I personally think orisa's spin shouldn't block so many melee type abilities and attacks, since she has other tanking abilities
[2023-01-05 22:46:02] <+aaymon86> If anything, it should just boop and not cancel, but maybe that might be a bad change idk
[2023-01-05 22:46:03] <%KevinKalani> @aaymon86 LMAO no people complain about Hog

[2023-01-05 22:53:52] <ItsDoffy> I think he means a heal heal
[2023-01-05 22:53:52] <+reaIarrow> I love junker Queen
[2023-01-05 22:53:53] <+javasapiens> very minor buff lol
[2023-01-05 22:53:54] <Codester_remix> A burst of instant healing
[2023-01-05 22:53:55] <%Grakthis> You got the burst, then called the knife, and got like 5 more HP?
[2023-01-05 22:53:55] <shipduckshaky> heal dont you mean reverse damage?
[2023-01-05 22:53:56] <broccolienjoyer4444444> does orisa gold stop the bleed?
[2023-01-05 22:53:56] <%ldoe3000> would work with your melee too
[2023-01-05 22:53:56] <Kibbles193> But does it happen right away?

[2023-01-05 22:53:57] <+Cazza17> so pre patch it just stopped healing?
[2023-01-05 22:53:57] <+aaymon86> Great change.  Means kills do so much for her
[2023-01-05 22:53:59] <+hawkzero25> So is it burst or instant heal Emongg????
[2023-01-05 22:53:59] <%ldoe3000> right
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <+jasonwocky> lets just go with an "express heal" vs a "local heal"
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <ChillyDOg> all instant heals are burst but not all burst heals are instant
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <%$janonymous> a heel turn heal?
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <acidface14> So 30 hp making her more of a viable hero?
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <Joltarn> @Grakthis i think he hit the bot as it respawned
[2023-01-05 22:54:02] <@%AwCrap> It's a binstant heal üò°
[2023-01-05 22:54:03] <giorgostakis> check hanzo and genji bugs
[2023-01-05 22:54:04] <Lammey0> so HoT?
[2023-01-05 22:54:04] <the_estimated_prophet> How much would it need to be to be a burst heal?
[2023-01-05 22:54:05] <%Nennai> KEKW
[2023-01-05 22:54:06] <+jodrajoko> burst heal? dont you mean a pick me up
[2023-01-05 22:54:06] <thaaad> nothing like getting 8% heal on a skill shot. Super comparable to 300hp + DR on an unmissable ability lol
[2023-01-05 22:54:06] <zenithfrfr> seems like theyre moving her toward more of a drain tank
[2023-01-05 22:54:06] <%+nothinggood27> an all-at-onceeroni?
[2023-01-05 22:54:07] <brownsugar_____> Is a yt heroes of olympus video coming?
[2023-01-05 22:54:09] <%KevinKalani> @Grakthis it's because the new bot respawned and the knife went back through it
[2023-01-05 22:54:10] <$DatSpaceBoy> Quick time Healy boy
[2023-01-05 22:54:11] <%chompchomp8> that -2s per enemy hit by carnage tho emongGasm
[2023-01-05 22:54:12] <awesomeacorn123> what about if you kill them with ult
[2023-01-05 22:54:12] <%Delex31> I don't know Emongg, this buff might let you finally rank up as a Tank, maybe to Top 500
[2023-01-05 22:54:13] <%ldoe3000> "it applies whatever bleed was left over when they died"
[2023-01-05 22:54:13] <%Grakthis> @Joltarn is that just because it was considered a NEW bot?
[2023-01-05 22:54:15] <Jwormy> How about a BURST of INSTANT healing @emongg  LUL
[2023-01-05 22:54:15] <%senibaj> ohh like a "blink and you miss it" heal?

[2023-01-05 22:54:25] <+HiiiBear> such a big change
[2023-01-05 22:54:26] <AnotherMeddler> Ooooh I was confused for a second, but I think he's talking about negative damage
[2023-01-05 22:54:30] <Joltarn> think so
[2023-01-05 22:54:33] <%Culein_> That‚Äôs a nice feature, focusing low hp targets is not more important
[2023-01-05 22:54:34] <DzilOne> the dagger used to do 80 + 15dot now it does 50 + 30 dot Madge Madge
[2023-01-05 22:54:38] <douglasc694> More like a utility passive
[2023-01-05 22:54:42] <Teccon> Can someone tell me why twitch is shitting the bed the past few days. Im buffering constantly
[2023-01-05 22:54:42] <r0xc> PEPEDS
[2023-01-05 22:54:45] <naughtyones> Seems like a fair change
[2023-01-05 22:54:46] <fork_on_the_left> Is the health recovered based on how much damage you deal with the bleed? I mean if you hit someone with armor or fortify/nano would it recover less?
[2023-01-05 22:54:46] <+HiiiBear> shes the executioner
[2023-01-05 22:54:47] <Mass_op> All heals are instant, some are burst some are HoTs
[2023-01-05 22:54:47] <%Grakthis> @Joltarn so that wouldn't give you the ticks from the knife hit, then additional ticks from calling it back?
[2023-01-05 22:54:48] <+Mateusvg22> Did you test zarya?
[2023-01-05 22:54:50] <%JustSwufty> I like this map
[2023-01-05 22:54:52] <+ShatteredSunOW> Knife, Jagged Blade, and Carnage bleeds all stack and burst heal combined???????
[2023-01-05 22:54:56] <+ClammyCement> Baptist is an burst of instant heal, but ana is an instant of burst heal YEPPERS
[2023-01-05 22:55:07] <%chompchomp8> @ClammyCement 5Head
[2023-01-05 22:55:12] <%ldoe3000> @ShatteredSunOW i would think so yes
[2023-01-05 22:55:13] <iisquiddyii> Do wounds now stack?
[2023-01-05 22:55:21] <Joltarn> @Grakthis the return hit the bot after it respawned, normally wouldn't get any extra ticks
[2023-01-05 22:55:21] <Jonapwns> there's a bunch of bugs with jq new buffs :( Sadge
[2023-01-05 22:55:24] <broccolienjoyer4444444> jq will probably become more meta as people learn to play around her imo
[2023-01-05 22:55:26] <%Grakthis> New JQ looks very good IFFFFFFFF you can land knives and get kills
[2023-01-05 22:55:27] <%ldoe3000> @iisquiddyii i think they already did
[2023-01-05 22:55:28] <r0xc> @ClammyCement peepoS
[2023-01-05 22:55:29] <ChronoAura> check
[2023-01-05 22:55:29] <HalcyonOverseer> Burst heal is not hard to understand. I don‚Äôt know how someone doesn‚Äôt understand the use of that term!
[2023-01-05 22:55:32] <%Culein_> So, in theory you could heal on a junk rat tire emongg?
[2023-01-05 22:55:33] <artboyo> lol torb
[2023-01-05 22:55:34] <+diamondave_> check
[2023-01-05 22:55:35] <+HiiiBear> @ClammyCement i see now. all makes sense
[2023-01-05 22:55:36] <ItsDoffy> hit ppl on bridge for lower cooldown if you hit breakables big win
[2023-01-05 22:55:39] <thaaad> @Jonapwns like? Already know about the railings one
[2023-01-05 22:55:39] <%+pianokeys888> does bleeding stack?
[2023-01-05 22:55:41] <Janek1991> Carnaging railings and pinatas also lowers cooldown lol. Also Cactus pots etc everything that can be destroyed
[2023-01-05 22:55:43] <%$sirsir_sr> no ana instantly burst heals its not the same as a burst of instance heals
[2023-01-05 22:55:45] <+ShatteredSunOW> Lets see how much healing Emongg does at the end of this match
[2023-01-05 22:55:45] <%KevinKalani> Blizzard should add cuts to the wounded characters LUL
[2023-01-05 22:55:48] <%KevinKalani> like visuals

[2023-01-05 23:09:19] <Homeycomb> I thought the bleed heal stays after death now so what does it matter if impact damage is 80?

[2023-01-05 23:09:41] <%Nennai> @funnyvoice_ amor reduces dmg taken by 30%, so if you got hit for 100 dmg, and you had 100 armor, you'd only lose 70 armor
[2023-01-05 23:09:44] <%KevinKalani> @Brando22788 I mean Blizzard makes me mad too, but some people wanna hate just to hate and didn't hear what they said. Like they literally said they couldn't fit the Hog rework in at the time, so they buffed the heroes that do better against him
[2023-01-05 23:09:45] <%N30NxL1T3x> not worse emongEZ

[2023-01-05 23:10:09] <naughtyones> Think it lines her up to be in a potentialy good spot depending on Hog changes and if Orisa gets adjusted aswell

[2023-01-05 23:10:14] <Tennian> blizz balance team made buffed a hero and it turns out the buff was actually a buff and not a nerf like most buffs usually are

[2023-01-05 23:14:26] <WageTV_> I like the carnage change, although unlikely, if you hit 4 people with carnage, you get a free second swing after
[2023-01-05 23:14:26] <$theinnerivy> Battle for olympus?
[2023-01-05 23:14:26] <+ech0cide> then everyone will whine about that

[2023-01-05 23:14:41] <%chompchomp8> theyre gonna nerf sojourn again COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM COPIUM
[2023-01-05 23:14:41] <VikingKong_> no because we all know. :) @bunsderp0
[2023-01-05 23:14:44] <%SonicBoom113> Road hog rework is later , I figure they want to buff people first then nerf afterwards
[2023-01-05 23:14:46] <+Tuberrox> lol she does more damage than genji
[2023-01-05 23:14:46] <%Delex31> I hoped for something for Rein...he's just....useless right now
[2023-01-05 23:14:49] <Jonapwns> so orisa is the best tank now I guess :(
[2023-01-05 23:14:50] <%Culein_> It‚Äôs cause the hog nerfs are going to be a slight rework. Probably eliminating one shot ability.
[2023-01-05 23:14:52] <%blondejohn96> we need to see it on the uptime
[2023-01-05 23:14:53] <%Nennai> @blondejohn96 I missed 1hr 9 again Sadge

[2023-01-05 23:15:51] <LucreDenouncer> she's not AS meta as she was in s1
[2023-01-05 23:15:54] <XrHidden> didnt soujourn already get nerfed? is she still strong?
[2023-01-05 23:15:57] <+jodrajoko> honestly 4 months is short for an overwatch meta
[2023-01-05 23:15:57] <LucreDenouncer> but still bad
[2023-01-05 23:16:02] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> but can you at least reduce tier 5 to under $10,000 because it's getting expensive

[2023-01-05 23:16:07] <%Nennai> @LazyLapin likely they will nerf orisa at the same time
[2023-01-05 23:16:07] <%Blackdima4> Idk which is worse... Does Blizz not know how to nerf her? Or do they REALLY not want to?

[2023-01-05 23:17:41] <%SonicBoom113> There needs to be less charge up on her primary fire. I feel like that can help with most of it. But then her ult just shreds so why do that lol

[2023-01-05 23:28:55] <%KevinKalani> It's hard to get excited about JQ healing 1500 when Hog can outheal his Lucio most games LUL
[2023-01-05 23:28:55] <budgetsuper> is it live in comp yet ?
[2023-01-05 23:28:56] <fomoyolo> @goldclassgaming u are a fvking ignorant noob. Just wait

[2023-01-05 23:29:25] <critzyqt> challenges for mercy skin seem hard or just me
[2023-01-05 23:29:26] <+jodrajoko> yall are being rude in chat lol
[2023-01-05 23:29:28] <+aroxis11> @fomoyolo is it drugs?

[2023-01-05 23:33:39] <Absnerdity> It's just been so long since anyone touched her that we've forgotten absLOL
[2023-01-05 23:33:40] <%KevinKalani> they shrunk Brig
[2023-01-05 23:33:40] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-05 23:33:41] <ReekOktober> wow
[2023-01-05 23:33:42] <$wacko721> eventually rein will drop from the roster and brig will have a 2000hp shield.
[2023-01-05 23:33:43] <+DjangoMarstolt> Needed the buff for all them toe shots
[2023-01-05 23:33:46] <+N4SixString> fov change? that wouldn't make sense tho

[2023-01-05 23:33:58] <TheeeSul> @Emongg they removed the self cleanse you get when using swift step on kiriko, but I didnt see it mentioned in the patch notes
[2023-01-05 23:34:00] <%KevinKalani> Brig is just shorter now. Placebo effect
[2023-01-05 23:34:00] <+FallenWolf69> Imma be 100% honest, im looking up old videos, I don't think they changed the size
[2023-01-05 23:34:04] <free_tube0> willl this give me the legendary moira skin im confused?

[2023-01-05 23:35:02] <akiyume> YES, Bottom left and bottom right of the shield is thicker
[2023-01-05 23:35:04] <+Cometchaser> isnt that good though? i thought she could get shot in her feet under the shield
[2023-01-05 23:35:06] <+GoldClassGaming> @enreves least horny overwatch player

[2023-01-05 23:35:14] <%The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa> YES the Shield is THICKER

[2023-01-05 23:35:43] <budgetsuper> maby it's a secret buff since it always felt like : wut that didn't hit my shield xD
[2023-01-05 23:35:43] <omnirax92> I checked a replay I had with brig some weeks ago and the shield is the same size as now
[2023-01-05 23:35:51] <+spikes141> i just checked an ml7 clip from a month ago and her sheild is the same as now
[2023-01-05 23:35:56] <%KevinKalani> Chat the shield is the same size, they just made her height more accurate for being Torb's daughter

[2023-01-05 23:36:14] <+FallenWolf69> They should have given her back the 600 HP shield
[2023-01-05 23:36:15] <derwan1r> @emongg junker queen have 2 animations of melee?
[2023-01-05 23:36:15] <xShroomies> why does it look so much bigger KEKW
[2023-01-05 23:36:18] <rockymeat> how do you counter orisa in high plat?
[2023-01-05 23:36:19] <+GoldClassGaming> @omnirax92 Thats because replays aren't recordings. If they change the model for something the new model will appear in old replays.
[2023-01-05 23:36:22] <ItsHBrk> @b0ngflicked not sure I haven't heard him mention it
[2023-01-05 23:36:23] <%Nennai> @Nennai oh I wanted him to put the goat skin on so I could compare my clip, but thats Sadge

[2023-01-05 23:37:14] <+GoldClassGaming> Like for example if you go watch a Hanzo replay from 2 days ago you won't see the recoil. Replays aren't recordings. Replays are the game playing back all the saved server data from that game.

[2023-01-05 23:54:44] <Toddwjp> @rymarjenkins zen is good

[2023-01-05 23:54:49] <Hussain_Kazmi> I feel like Sombra shouldnt have been nerfed that hard she was stopping Road Hog
[2023-01-05 23:54:50] <+apposhi> True
[2023-01-05 23:55:05] <rolltides_> OW2 servers down?
[2023-01-05 23:55:08] <SlimGekko> Hey I just checked in! Tried the new event yet? :D
[2023-01-05 23:55:08] <GamerBandit8104> @rhettofbodom ok thanks  I thought it was 1500 but 8t wasn't working
[2023-01-05 23:55:18] <hawks_sa> JQ needs life steal from her shotgun
[2023-01-05 23:55:23] <Swayydarac> should have nerfed genji
[2023-01-05 23:55:27] <hollowcrescent0_0> kiriko just ruins the game with suzu, she makes hog strong, jk usless and ana a heal bot
[2023-01-05 23:55:33] <+raienbrasa> @Emongg thoughts on reverting ball tether out of spawn change, since there's only one tank?
[2023-01-05 23:55:36] <%N30NxL1T3x> math pepeMeltdown
[2023-01-05 23:55:37] <+Godgundam1019> Even if they nerf hog he will just require more team work just like other tanks just like when we say she has rail say I have hook and focus target just like Orisa used to do

[2023-01-05 23:55:54] <+apposhi> 30 x 1,25 = 37,5
[2023-01-05 23:55:55] <+Goodstewie> @Emongg Isn't that 30 damage diminished against armor though?

[2023-01-05 23:56:08] <+PhenomeNoLan> did u see the kiriko bug/secret nerf
[2023-01-05 23:56:09] <Midnide> Alive < Dying rooIsee
[2023-01-05 23:56:09] <lemonlimetea3> @emongg why don't I see you or others knife the ground and pull as you ult?
[2023-01-05 23:56:15] <%+DylanInSpace> No no the cooldown on spawn. Not the tether duration
[2023-01-05 23:56:18] <%redkakti> YEPPERS
[2023-01-05 23:56:19] <derwan1r> i want to see how junker queen can play on open queue, becouse zarya can ult and junker queen all time can press only s

[2023-01-05 23:56:47] <+PhenomeNoLan> the kiriko TP doesnt clear an anti anymore
[2023-01-05 23:56:50] <+Necrosythe> with the new 30 healing that tech is less valuable now even
[2023-01-05 23:56:53] <lemonlimetea3> so truuuuuuuu
[2023-01-05 23:56:54] <hawks_sa> @hollowcrescent0_0 kiriko is the only support holding ranked together, she gets nerfed and the role dies
[2023-01-05 23:56:54] <+raienbrasa> @Emongg i see what you're sayin. my thought was, there wasn't another tank to stall until ball gets back, so there's still a window
[2023-01-05 23:57:00] <paketmjolk> Does ball deserve a buff or a rework?
[2023-01-05 23:57:17] <ShoopyDaWhoopy> TIL the barrier/payload on push maps procs the new carnage cd reduction
[2023-01-05 23:57:17] <Swayydarac> @Emongg nice cat on da cat palace
[2023-01-05 23:57:31] <bansheegbb> good balls?
[2023-01-05 23:57:31] <%+DylanInSpace> Grapple cd on spawn feels bad

[2023-01-05 23:57:50] <+Jaxtonian> I‚Äôd like a small damage buff for ball. I agree with Chazm/Chamz
[2023-01-05 23:57:50] <%urban69ing08> @Emongg Junker gets rocked by roadhog i dont think it will be huge
[2023-01-05 23:57:51] <nate_codes> @ShoopyDaWhoopy no way LUL
[2023-01-05 23:57:52] <%Enter4none> @Emongg alreay played the event, or saving it for later?
[2023-01-05 23:57:54] <derwan1r> @emongg ball get so much space, he dont bad heroz he was skill to play him
[2023-01-05 23:57:56] <+TwoPointInfinity> hello!
[2023-01-05 23:58:07] <klastrophesses> huge brigite buff
[2023-01-05 23:58:09] <%enreves> They really upped the grind needed to get event achievements for the skin this time
[2023-01-05 23:58:09] <+ronalddubyt> What are some changes to heros not mentioned in the patchnotes, just an overview
[2023-01-05 23:58:11] <+Necrosythe> ball's whole playstyle is tough with only 1 tank. but a hog and orisa nerf would be a big buff to him
[2023-01-05 23:58:17] <Janek1991> why cant Zarya help the push on push maps
[2023-01-05 23:58:27] <+TDS462> What Tank do you feel is the best as a baseline for strength currently that you would want others on par with?
[2023-01-05 23:58:30] <%N30NxL1T3x> !ball
[2023-01-05 23:58:30] <+raienbrasa> yessss buff ball yessssss
[2023-01-05 23:58:30] <@%^StreamElements> "So we lost that fight, I'm gonna go ball here" - Emongg, when he decides to throw and join the avoid lobbies emongWink
[2023-01-05 23:58:31] <TheeeSul> @Emongg kiriko lost her self cleanse when using swift step, wasnt mentioned in the patch noted though.
[2023-01-05 23:58:35] <ShoopyDaWhoopy> @nate_codes yup if you fight around the barrier you get free cd reduction
[2023-01-05 23:58:38] <entitiesofthecosmos> i think after the next round of changes we could see ball jump up a bunch of tiers
[2023-01-05 23:58:39] <lemonlimetea3> @emongg play ball you pussy you wont
[2023-01-05 23:58:40] <+jodrajoko> also gilbralter and numbani arent in the game right now either
[2023-01-05 23:58:40] <+MrUniqueName> So they should buff ball, right?

[2023-01-05 23:58:49] <+mrchez0910> What‚Äôs ur opinion on dps, balanced?
[2023-01-05 23:58:54] <$Xninja629> What is the swift step bug?
[2023-01-05 23:58:55] <biak911> Oh and it's the doom from a while ago
[2023-01-05 23:58:56] <+TwoPointInfinity> are you under contract to stay on twitch? Twitch has been becoming less and less user friendly in my opinion. Would you ever re-stream to youtube or switch anything like that? Is where you stream ever been considered?
[2023-01-05 23:58:56] <SLAYARNOLD> Sojourn still meta?
[2023-01-05 23:58:58] <losx925> A good ball player is super annoying
[2023-01-05 23:59:02] <Matthom> Do you think they should re buff doom @Emongg ?
[2023-01-05 23:59:06] <hollowcrescent0_0> orisa needs a health nerf, she has so many defensive abilities and armour, with one pocket she is basically immortal
[2023-01-05 23:59:08] <biak911> Oh wow
[2023-01-05 23:59:08] <%Enter4none> Emongg's stream are my favorite, the vibe and the chill is so good
