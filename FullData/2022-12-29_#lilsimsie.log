[2022-12-29 22:35:38] <moonvell_> The game looks a lot better on PC apparently, but it's nice to have a to-go with the switch
[2022-12-29 22:35:38] <epiccactus1> If you buy the game make sure to get one of the versions with moonstones because there is no way to buy moonstones at this time and you only get 10 per day and need 2,500 per festival. :)
[2022-12-29 22:35:40] <sagelovessscatss> I love it on console
[2022-12-29 22:35:40] <+purple_insomniac> switch is a lot better than when it first came out
[2022-12-29 22:35:41] <wesleyds_gaming> pc all the way
[2022-12-29 22:35:43] <%+Abi_Jee> switch player! I'm fine with it!!
[2022-12-29 22:35:43] <elephantopera> I‚Äôve heard there are many bugs on Switch
[2022-12-29 22:35:44] <%Bambalamber> Yeah I even play it on my steamdeck and it still works just as well it's great
[2022-12-29 22:35:49] <$pcombs11811> it looks like feeding the crocodiles is easier on the computer than with xbox. lol
[2022-12-29 22:35:50] <%+GrandmaEugene> I will say it tends to crash quite a bit on the switch, and the decorating functions are a lot more difficult on the switch
[2022-12-29 22:35:52] <thelorak9> @cupcakemagic420 yeah, I would like to see a Scandinavian castle for Anna
[2022-12-29 22:35:53] <ally_wins> It is much less glitchy on switch now that it has been updated
[2022-12-29 22:35:53] <%+Abi_Jee> I'm happy either way
[2022-12-29 22:35:53] <chickenpox_CLOUT> there are some very game breaking bugs on switch

[2022-12-29 22:36:06] <%OMGCharlotte> I play it with a controller on my PC. REMEMBER TO NOT TIM TRAVEL if you have it on the switch. I don't know if that still breaks the game
[2022-12-29 22:36:07] <gamemelina121212> I play on switch lite! Works fine
[2022-12-29 22:36:08] <%+CatRenee> There was paw prints on the ground by the ponds?!

[2022-12-29 22:45:58] <%Jeais> The crocs are so frustrating. Closest I've come to rage quitting a game
[2022-12-29 22:45:59] <%42hitch42> lol

[2022-12-29 22:46:08] <@%+ceesees> i have most of the critters but the ones who show up really late at night
[2022-12-29 22:46:08] <$MarylynBirds> I don't get an option to interact with any animals except for the squirrels, is there a trick?
[2022-12-29 22:46:09] <%42hitch42> very similar
[2022-12-29 22:46:10] <%bealines> for the record, i find you very well-spoken and natural on camera. i also notice that people only seem to bother women streamers about their speech patterns...isn't that interesting
[2022-12-29 22:46:13] <%crimesociere> Omg on my game, the white squirrel looked grey
[2022-12-29 22:46:13] <%$Theresevers> other
[2022-12-29 22:46:16] <%$kriisteenie> i kept mistaking remy for a squirrel

[2022-12-29 22:46:19] <nanareyes23> Need help with the crocs can not fed them to save my soul.
[2022-12-29 22:46:21] <%+RogueTownie> The raccoons are so hard for me, I just chase them down and block them so they can‚Äôt run away lol
[2022-12-29 22:46:22] <%$SailorScout04> I just don‚Äôt bother feeding the raccoons and crocodiles because I know I‚Äôll get mad trying to
[2022-12-29 22:46:23] <xxthatgirlkayxx> When woody falls down, I always try to water him ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[2022-12-29 22:46:28] <saltedh0ney> Can you make critters you companion? For some reason a turtle follows me everywhere now?
[2022-12-29 22:46:28] <@%brewwin> @bectoriousx id get uber
[2022-12-29 22:46:28] <cookie139_> My controllers drift a lot so it‚Äôs very hard to get the gators and racoons
[2022-12-29 22:46:29] <kiwi_fr0g> The raccoon is kind of scary
[2022-12-29 22:46:33] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @brewwin i technically know how to do it, i just cant be bothered to wait. their up/down is so subltle compared to the raccoons
[2022-12-29 22:46:36] <abigailt66> I was confused why buzz was tiny, but he‚Äôs a toy
[2022-12-29 22:46:36] <$pcombs11811> the way I look at it... if you can feed the crocodiles the raccoons are so easy.
[2022-12-29 22:46:38] <+becca494> Oh so like the crocodiles
[2022-12-29 22:46:41] <%+gossipstone31> Is it the same with the crocs?

[2022-12-29 23:25:53] <%ARomanticAce> the "loved gifts" are limited in that you'll only gain friendship from each gift once (so you can't give them their daily gifts over and over to speedrun friendship)

[2022-12-29 23:47:09] <@%brewwin> people eat chilli with cheese and sour cream + cornbread traditionally
[2022-12-29 23:47:10] <%Missygirl93> @kirbysmiles13 Chili can be loose and come in many forms... Chicken chili is so pale!
[2022-12-29 23:47:10] <royalt110> I like chili with French fries
[2022-12-29 23:47:11] <%+m1chelej> yeah I need my soups to be like hearty
[2022-12-29 23:47:13] <k41mz> i looove mushy and liquid but cant stand soft cooked vegetables and literally any fruit because of texture hah
[2022-12-29 23:47:14] <marshmallow_fIuff> my fam does smt similar except mac n cheese noodles (without the cheese)
[2022-12-29 23:47:15] <%$CarlyPea> soup chat rise up
[2022-12-29 23:47:15] <%ARomanticAce> soup is more of like...a broth. chili has a higher foodstuff-to-broth ratio than soup does, i think.
[2022-12-29 23:47:17] <%$brimarieg> Omg I‚Äôm playing switch sports and my opponent is name so called soup
[2022-12-29 23:47:18] <clari_nlsn> I put crackers in my chili to make it less soupy
[2022-12-29 23:47:22] <%+darknstormy_nails> I love tomato soup, but I am very specific about my soup
[2022-12-29 23:47:22] <+xemily330> Did you get the festive fish?
[2022-12-29 23:47:22] <%$PagesInked> chili should not be liquid
[2022-12-29 23:47:23] <kiwi_fr0g> I have some leftover chili and some leftover rice. I think I‚Äôm going to try it together tonight
[2022-12-29 23:47:23] <georgiapop1> chilli and chips is top tier though!
[2022-12-29 23:47:24] <%+belovedjasmine> I also put chili or black bean soup over rice
[2022-12-29 23:47:24] <+purple_insomniac> I could eat soup everyday of my life
[2022-12-29 23:47:26] <%ammr_b> broccoli cheddar is the only soup that doesnt give me the ick
[2022-12-29 23:47:36] <%+kirbysmiles13> @missygirl93 Haha yes you‚Äôre not wrong
[2022-12-29 23:47:38] <%$BresWaffles> are you still working on decorating your town?? do you have a video of what you've decorated so far?? @lilsimsie
[2022-12-29 23:47:38] <kiwi_fr0g> Cereal is just morning soup prove me wrong
[2022-12-29 23:47:38] <lorettabelleart> chili over rice is a top tier combo too since the rice and beans make it a complete protein eggbabLove
[2022-12-29 23:47:40] <TabbyTod> ive never thought to put chili over rice but now I really want to
[2022-12-29 23:47:42] <Amy08657> Hi!!!!

[2022-12-29 23:48:19] <AntonioE777> chili is more of a stew than soup if that makes sense

Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.
