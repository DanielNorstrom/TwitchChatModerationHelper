[2023-01-05 07:01:29] <%+doctorsauceman> He suffered a cardiac arrest and that comes with needing a breathing tube. He‚Äôs recovering from that process and his lungs work (from the keyhole window I can see). This is an expected course of recovery. He‚Äôs young, I‚Äôm guessing he makes a complete recovery

[2023-01-05 07:04:43] <%+DnBJohnny> chris pronger had the same injury in the nhl in 98 and went on to become one of the best defensemen ever in the NHL
[2023-01-05 07:04:43] <%talrielz> i stopped playing little league baseball after i got hit in the face with like a mid 70s mph pitch

[2023-01-05 07:04:50] <%talrielz> hard to wanna play after that shit
[2023-01-05 07:04:52] <%+CloverGrieveland> Christian Erikson had a huge scare and he's back on the pitch, a lot of soccer players do, and I'd say they're equally stressful on the heart.
[2023-01-05 07:05:13] <%$fittyleben> Did they actually confirm commotio cortis?

[2023-01-05 07:44:38] <+StuffedVulture> ooze viper was tradeable, but also the class cards that did things when you traded (amulet, rogue weapon, warlock imp summon, hunter treat gives rush to a minion, etc.)
[2023-01-05 07:44:42] <%talrielz> i think my favorite mechanics are tradeable, spellburst, discover (when the limited pool isnt causing obvious issues), dredge, and rush (when its not over printed into oblivion)

[2023-01-05 10:38:26] <redmarlboroxd> But if the mode that you are talking about lacks how many loses you can have, it would suit the players who played the most during that week/hour imo, so someone who has 40-40 win/lose ratio would get better rewards than someone who won 25 times and lost 0
[2023-01-05 10:38:26] <Fudge2> drafting dk i took the triple rune blood destroy all minions card on choice one.  then i got almost no class cards all draft since i was full locked blood

[2023-01-05 10:39:45] <redmarlboroxd> ofc if you play more u will be better on average, but thats more for standard/wild
[2023-01-05 10:40:12] <n4n4m1t> What does it mean full locked blood? You can have only fixed number of class cards as dk?

[2023-01-05 10:41:33] <redmarlboroxd> All Im saying that the idea of something simmilar to arena on a month/week basis lacks a lot, nothing more
[2023-01-05 10:41:34] <%talrielz> playing more definitely benefits you in arena. the mode has decently high variance in its best metas and very high variance in its worst. the more you play the better shot u have at brute forcing rng to get a good streak of 30 runs to pander to the dogshit metric we have at quantifying skill

[2023-01-05 11:24:38] <!%Ellyon> @KBB24_Mamba_Forever there's copycat recipes that are easy to find
[2023-01-05 11:24:39] <%$mrfisher101> Im guessing honey chicken is like soy sauce honey garlic and chili flakes?
[2023-01-05 11:24:40] <@%+smellyhead> cornflake crumbs are delicious tho on breaded chicken
[2023-01-05 11:24:55] <%$mrfisher101> Sure is @smellyhead
[2023-01-05 11:25:31] <%$mrfisher101> Anything breaded is inherently unhealthy. The breading sucks up a ton of fat to become crisp, so you cant really eat a lot of breaded stuff if you wanna eat healthy

[2023-01-05 11:30:55] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> @mrfisher101 there is a website where you can copy the recipe url and it will post just the recipe. its like justtherecipe.com or something likee that
[2023-01-05 11:31:07] <%talrielz> instructions unclear, my dinner required me to prank my extended family and then floss on them after they stared at me in horror. i just wanted some lasagna
[2023-01-05 11:31:11] <%$mrfisher101> @Ellyon that is a pretty easy looking recipe. I might try it out!
[2023-01-05 11:31:13] <%Grognosh2> In Norway we called it panering and we use griljermel. mel = flour
[2023-01-05 11:31:15] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I steam rolled a lobby with double wrathgaurd, but the quests are so fucking lame
[2023-01-05 11:31:25] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> yeah it literally just matters what quest you roll and what minions are in
[2023-01-05 11:31:30] <%$mrfisher101> @Grognosh2 what does the griljer part mean?
[2023-01-05 11:31:38] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> only good quest is getting golden buddy

[2023-01-05 11:32:42] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I got it one time with Eudora and I had a golden windfury elemental and it was a 85/80 on like turn 10 it was great LUL
[2023-01-05 11:33:01] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> later than turn 10 but you get what I mean
[2023-01-05 11:33:02] <%Grognosh2> I prefer the double coat Kreygasm Breaded some cod last week
[2023-01-05 11:33:10] <%$mrfisher101> @Grognosh2 I just googled it, its just fine breading (In danish we call it rasp, but we also call it "at panere" something)
[2023-01-05 11:33:25] <!%Ellyon> I've recently discovered "nailed it!" on netflix. As someone who's good at baking it's hilarious to see
