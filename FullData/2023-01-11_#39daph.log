However, we believed it could still embody League's broad universe and competitive spirit while celebrating the start of a new season. - So it sounds like a codeword of we over spend on other games so sorry league gamers
[2023-01-11 05:06:59] <%FeedMyPets> go spend more money on our valorant skin so we can afford bigger cinematic

[2023-01-11 07:06:20] <%TheCovidDodger69> In The Rise of Skywalker lightsaber duel, Rey is feral while Kylo Ren is calm. This is because the scene was filmed during a cold November. Daisy Ridley wore a wet, sleeveless blouse while Adam Driver had a padded wetsuit on beneath his long-sleeved costume. Daisy really was trying to kill him.

[2023-01-11 07:12:23] <%+imsodry> it was interesting
[2023-01-11 07:12:33] <%+imsodry> raiden was more like a play date with her

You will never be the protagonist in an anime, you will never have superpowers that allow you to overcome your most greatest tribulations, you will always be a loser.
