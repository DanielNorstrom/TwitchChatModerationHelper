[2022-12-10 19:03:34] <brianthedraftpony007> Feels like the dev team does not really understand how to make a tank fun. They had the idea with being more aggressive yet they make heroes and balances that prevent that aggressive play from happening.
[2022-12-10 19:03:41] <limydevotee> I don’t want to play tank at all cause it’s so stressful and not fun

[2022-12-10 19:03:46] <+chai3spice> @MartianMagic Im mostly just tired of the death threats. But its making it really hard to climb. I was low play/high gold in OW1, which I know isnt a lot but I went down to silver in OW2 and I am having such a hard time because of the men losing their minds

[2022-12-10 19:03:53] <%+Valkoor_> @flats As a support player, I feel like support certainly isn’t weak, but is unfun and not engaging because it’s turned into healbotting. But some characters are still easy to dive + kill, which makes it especially frustrating.
[2022-12-10 19:03:53] <Frost_Dragon00> @Flats Until recently what I heard for the most part is that block was bad because then Ramattra does nothing. Could you walk through how that opinion changed?

[2022-12-10 19:05:07] <iLouWavy> @flats this is the Activision plan, they cater to casuals and leave the top 1% to rot. Look at cod for the past 4 years.
[2022-12-10 19:05:14] <KittyKat1988> Are drops not working on twitch mobile?
[2022-12-10 19:05:14] <Jur3ky> ye cuz casual was = comp

[2022-12-10 19:05:53] <+Wiltings> I think the biggest problem is that they're not even preaching to the casual community, just the Whale part of it @Flats

[2022-12-10 19:07:27] <%+juniperskye5252> games switching from a competitive focus to casual focus ruins them imo. destiny 2 is falling apart because they focused on pulling in new players and the casual experience and those players didn't really stick around and the dedicated try hard playerbase is leaving because they feel neglected
[2022-12-10 19:07:28] <+Rody2312> nerv genji

[2022-12-10 19:13:19] <EtherealBussy> It’s so easy to abuse the ult retention thing. I can start off as JQ and run in super aggro then die and come back as the “appropriate” tank with just as much if not more ult charge than the enemy tank. This didn’t feel like as big of an issue for DPS but for tanks it’s awful

[2022-12-10 19:17:41] <soord_n_boord> Yeah my MMR is kinda screwy. @flats I've been playing with Diamond to T500 in qp queues LUL
[2022-12-10 19:17:41] <%+kboorath> I genuinely do not fucking understand why they can't just tell us every time we play a match
[2022-12-10 19:17:41] <+NK_Irmath> Apex started to tank when they refused to add a permanent solo mode
[2022-12-10 19:17:45] <%itmeeva> literally ridiculous
[2022-12-10 19:17:47] <%aurlohk> does this also mean too that since your lobbies would technically be plat for example, your teammates might not nessecarily be plat or would they be plat technically as well?
[2022-12-10 19:17:48] <BR3323Y> I was a high plat player in OW1 but in OW2 I've been hard stuck silver... I also solo queue though but yeah, it's been rough...

[2022-12-10 19:18:59] <kroniksoops> i went from diamond 3 to plat 5 was really mad
[2022-12-10 19:19:01] <+gouda_ow> i was diamond 1 season 1, took a break, came back to season 2 and it gave me masters 5 lol
[2022-12-10 19:19:02] <Vakaromee> i can't even see what my rank is without squinting so hard 4Head
[2022-12-10 19:19:06] <mrreklez> Thirst for money is sending this game down a dark path

[2022-12-10 19:19:22] <peaktf> i got reset from gm 5 to plat 1 lol
[2022-12-10 19:19:28] <sokifire> the ranking system really makes me think climbing the ranks again is utterly pointless

[2022-12-10 19:20:15] <mrreklez> 100%
[2022-12-10 19:20:15] <Merry_Dingleberry> Did they ever explain why they changed fire strike?
[2022-12-10 19:20:19] <+Desh13> they created  a melee hero in a fps game, great idea, good luck trying to balance that lmao
[2022-12-10 19:20:20] <javader332> What did I enter into?
[2022-12-10 19:20:22] <+thePlayer_6> PREACH
[2022-12-10 19:20:23] <waitingtobeariel> hehe haha hook
[2022-12-10 19:20:23] <elephantum__> @EvanUSA I'm on my way out the door lol. Overwatch only DISGUISES itself as a "competitive game."
[2022-12-10 19:20:24] <+LuktronMk1> the tire kil
[2022-12-10 19:20:24] <%+EvanUSA> I FEEL SO HELPLESS ON REIN
[2022-12-10 19:20:25] <+DannyDeVitosHairline> no truer words have ever been spoken Clap
[2022-12-10 19:20:34] <aokamiow> As a Rein lover I feel this so hard. Hitting good charges and DOUBLE firestrikes feels so shit when you loose that reward of getting the kill
[2022-12-10 19:20:35] <ObsceneSanity> They rely on data bc they dont play the game
[2022-12-10 19:20:38] <dalelouieligon> Tru Factz by Flats
[2022-12-10 19:20:38] <%Violet_Ashes> OW developers aren't listening to their community and its sad
[2022-12-10 19:20:38] <+osumattg> I played a game as support then logged off to play something else. Just not enjoyable or rewarding.

[2022-12-10 19:20:41] <Timurelang> it sound like they look at the wrong data actually

[2022-12-10 19:20:44] <%+EvanUSA> rein needs a HARD BUFF
[2022-12-10 19:20:44] <Getting_Gash_gaming1> What do you mean by art? @Flats
[2022-12-10 19:20:45] <brianthedraftpony007> I feel that hitting 2 fire strikes should be treated the same as a widow one shot. The skill earns that kill.
[2022-12-10 19:20:46] <Vakaromee> they lost that art long time ago Sadge
[2022-12-10 19:20:48] <+Left_Brainn> damn flats is spitting this morning
[2022-12-10 19:20:51] <JPeaches> Doomers
[2022-12-10 19:20:52] <kryonikgaming> its becoming cod. theres no skill needed anymore
[2022-12-10 19:20:53] <JayForPay> they dont seem to balance around difficulty or complexity. just numbers with no context.
[2022-12-10 19:20:53] <cdog052407> Hopefully
[2022-12-10 19:20:54] <Demolition_Derby> well put

[2022-12-10 19:20:56] <Merry_Dingleberry> @soord_n_boord did they not state why?

[2022-12-10 19:21:02] <%jnics23> it's like the story of armor on planes in the world wars
[2022-12-10 19:21:06] <lebonotlucio> Qualitative and quantitative combination is the only way to distill the customer mindset @flats
[2022-12-10 19:21:06] <james9759> Where will the podcast be?
[2022-12-10 19:21:07] <kaine_dok> Truing

[2022-12-10 19:21:08] <+RunNGunTaxiCo> Why aren’t you in direct contact with their update team???
[2022-12-10 19:21:09] <ver1ser> anyways here is the new rein skin
[2022-12-10 19:21:09] <%ItsHeebyJeeby> I hope you turn around as well, ITS BEHIND YOU
[2022-12-10 19:21:09] <tommyturbo> I think the words you are looking for is quantitative and qualitative data
[2022-12-10 19:21:09] <%+sierramarlee> you can only play like 5 heroes unless you wanna get rolled. it's a joke
[2022-12-10 19:21:11] <+chai3spice> Its kinda like corporations look at data and make rule changes despite never doing the job
[2022-12-10 19:21:11] <LightningCh> i was gonna start getting into comp with OW2 as im really new to it.
[2022-12-10 19:21:11] <%$TeaHauss> catJAM PepeHands You've lost catJAM PepeHands that looooovin feelin
[2022-12-10 19:21:11] <+osumattg> Before the gameplay made up for the lack of rewards to some extent but not anymore. Feels bad man
[2022-12-10 19:21:11] <$its_ratboy> can i get a tldr of what they messed up this time?
[2022-12-10 19:21:13] <waitingtobeariel> @Timurelang where is the data analyst? we just wanna talk ( :

[2022-12-10 19:21:18] <Eclipse016> I only started playing since the launch of OW2 and this season has been incredibly unfun as a support player
[2022-12-10 19:21:19] <%+5Picoseconds> @Flats They aren't even looking at the right data
[2022-12-10 19:21:20] <%+slerbderbglerb> @slerbderbglerb fr I'm new to ow and not knowing if I'm doing the right things hurts my ability to work on my gameplay. Like saying I'm plat 5 doesnt help if it means nothing
[2022-12-10 19:21:21] <LightningCh> but with the mid season and how s2 has started, i dont think i will
[2022-12-10 19:21:23] <bmnjnjk> @Flats When Devs rely purely on data it just means they dont play or even at minimum watch there own game
[2022-12-10 19:21:26] <abudariaofzezeh> Survivorship bias in overwatch bruh
[2022-12-10 19:21:26] <fancy2200> ever since dooms skillgap became non existent i quit ow
[2022-12-10 19:21:26] <aLemonShark> They are relying on their content team to carry WAAAAY too much

[2022-12-10 19:21:28] <ogxarrow> @flats Cass rework needs his flash back on a longer cooldown
[2022-12-10 19:21:38] <soord_n_boord> @merry_dingleberry that was their why. "Oh you have two fire strikes now, and people are actually getting kills with it!"
[2022-12-10 19:21:38] <%$TeaHauss> Prayge viral vid
[2022-12-10 19:21:38] <raulohz> dont worry flats hopefully it will get better

[2022-12-10 19:22:00] <javader332> I’m confused
[2022-12-10 19:22:01] <%+kboorath> They're just treating everything as an independent variable in their data when there are really lots of dependencies
[2022-12-10 19:22:02] <psn_lsarx> why is brigg in the game?
[2022-12-10 19:22:02] <mrreklez> @aapob1 lootboxes+ old level system and I am happy

[2022-12-10 19:22:16] <sinusIB> Genji metas never been annoying like this
[2022-12-10 19:22:16] <aapob1> @aapob1 yep
[2022-12-10 19:22:17] <ogxarrow> @kaine_dok why put it on a 15 second cooldown
[2022-12-10 19:22:18] <tosvami_gaming> Holliday Bake of with Emongg PLSSSSS
[2022-12-10 19:22:20] <%aurlohk> another good question is why certain fan favorites like Rein and Genji get shit on with nerfs while others like Tracer or Reaper or them DON'T get that treatment
[2022-12-10 19:22:22] <%+plongsofplongolia> i think the biggest issue with support is the lack of options compared to the other roles as well.
[2022-12-10 19:22:27] <+RunNGunTaxiCo> Why are u not on the line for the art aspect with the OW Dev team??
[2022-12-10 19:22:27] <javader332> Wait actually now this isn’t a rhetorical question can someone tell me what just happened?
[2022-12-10 19:22:28] <james9759> Where will the podcast be?
[2022-12-10 19:22:30] <+kytes_music> as l9ng as the money is flowing in nowadays the devs done care

[2022-12-10 19:23:02] <%+Valkoor_> flats As a support player, I feel like support certainly isn’t weak, but is unfun and not engaging because it’s turned into healbotting. But some characters are still easy to dive + kill, which makes it especially frustrating. And TANKING has become “waiting for my DPS to get a kill”

[2022-12-10 19:23:25] <kaine_dok> @ogxarrow that would help, but it’s still annoying. The problem is him having a stun and having a secondary fire that lets you negate the free trial for life. Right?

[2022-12-10 19:23:35] <elephantum__> @CRACKERBOI yup! because it's pulling the lever on a slot machine
[2022-12-10 19:23:36] <%+Serrin_> @Flats I actually hate Reaper and Solider because of how strong they are for how easy they are to play.  I feel a weird sort of pressure to play one of them every game, especially if we're losing, just because... It's so easy to do so much? Stand on high ground as soldier and never leave and your team usually wins. If they start diving you or the tank is the obvious carry you go Reaper and never die, always be behind them, and your team usually wins.  I WANT to play Tracer, I'm pretty good but.
[2022-12-10 19:23:36] <%aurlohk> we need to take away all the numbers data from the OW devs and then dont get it back

[2022-12-10 19:25:05] <elephantum__> @CRACKERBOI The game struggles to put "like minded" people together. Getting stuck with teammates that take 1v5 nonstop is absurd. Why am I playing with that guy?

[2022-12-10 19:25:13] <%+plongsofplongolia> i think hogs self heal is more of an issue than his hook tbh
[2022-12-10 19:25:14] <ver1ser> @Flats  what do you think of the primordial ram skin in the bp? i think its his best skin/ very close to posseidon
[2022-12-10 19:25:14] <tosvami_gaming> BINGOOOO
[2022-12-10 19:25:14] <+xneonyu> @Flats sorry if its a dumb question, but why dont they balance heroes in each specific rank tier? eg: low rank in a way, high rank in another way
[2022-12-10 19:25:14] <+ExpertAtAll> I just hate that we’re gonna need to wait 2+ weeks for maybe another balance update

[2022-12-10 19:25:25] <Evangelman12> this is the first stream ive been able to catch, love your youtube vids keep the great content coming, hopefully ill subscribe soon so you can roast my comp gameplay
[2022-12-10 19:25:26] <%+fracture_b1itz> its also stupid how last season we only got comp points for the highest role. and now dropping us. losing more and more interest in this game and iv been playing since OW1 day 1.
[2022-12-10 19:25:26] <985geek> We have more characters than r6 siege and they use pick ban system
[2022-12-10 19:25:28] <soord_n_boord> @flats Top 5 Dps that aren't Sojourn, go! LUL
[2022-12-10 19:25:32] <ghostfreak001> maybe if Hog's sustain during Take a breather was reduced i would be fine with Rein being as is. Given that he does have a shield and can protect the team which Hog has to do by being offensive. Just my opinion
[2022-12-10 19:25:34] <%itmeeva> that sounds miserable KEKW
[2022-12-10 19:25:39] <%+D3EP_12> Best supp in the game?
[2022-12-10 19:25:45] <BR3323Y> imagine you're chilling in QP and you see these guys on the enemy team- choked LUL
[2022-12-10 19:25:47] <@%chompchomp8> also imagine how ass it would be if the hero was like 20% weaker after one game LUL
[2022-12-10 19:25:47] <+xneonyu> hmm true true
[2022-12-10 19:25:51] <+NK_Irmath> That sounds like fighting game talk
[2022-12-10 19:25:58] <%+Cuthalion1991> you have to balance around highest elo. not proffesional but highest ranks.
[2022-12-10 19:26:00] <loaf_gaming1> FLATS what  hero needs a full rework
[2022-12-10 19:26:01] <CooLitten> roll for sandwich when?

[2022-12-10 19:26:05] <%+amr183> Would increasing the cooldown on hog heal be a good enough nerf?
[2022-12-10 19:26:05] <%grobot93> I've been climbing out of gold with rein and that's exactly what I'm worried about
[2022-12-10 19:26:06] <brianthedraftpony007> Sounds like a rough version of hero pools

[2022-12-10 19:26:13] <kaine_dok> @ogxarrow You’re not wrong, but theres ana too. I think maybe we need a stun that lasts a SUPER short time. Like an ability that mostly just exists to cancel transformations and momentarily stop people.
[2022-12-10 19:26:21] <+NK_Irmath> In a fighting game you want to balance a cast around each other but it's a bit different with a game like ow

[2022-12-10 19:27:42] <%+Valkoor_> I think you extend her whipshot, and then we’ll have her ult rework coming in the Spring
[2022-12-10 19:27:46] <coleeboy10> Is getting 30 plus kills a game as bastion in silver good
[2022-12-10 19:27:47] <ThePrinceOfKidambi> Hey @Flats - in your opinion - what's the first thing a new player should do after installing OW 2 to learn the game better
[2022-12-10 19:27:50] <%+plongsofplongolia> imagine if all tanks had some form of self heal how much more reliable theyd be.
[2022-12-10 19:27:51] <soord_n_boord> @amr183 I think his damage resistance while healing needs to be lowered
[2022-12-10 19:27:52] <raulohz> flats what do you think Cassidy needs to be usable in higher elo
[2022-12-10 19:27:52] <%+bluberryninja> I only have one word for @Flats BING CHILLING :)
[2022-12-10 19:27:53] <bugetalucard> Give brig bongo Instead of rally…..

[2022-12-10 19:27:55] <psn_lsarx> hog need a buff 🙀
[2022-12-10 19:27:56] <bugetalucard> Lmao
[2022-12-10 19:27:57] <+planetHesley> competitive just feels like quick play but more toxic
[2022-12-10 19:28:02] <cup_a_joe> What’s actually changed to make the gameplay of comp less enjoyable? Is it just hero balances?
[2022-12-10 19:28:05] <SiomoG> I think for a buff they should up ramattras damage by one on his omnivore form
[2022-12-10 19:28:11] <ogxarrow> @kaine_dok he was only mcrightclick because his flash was on a short cooldown raise the cooldown no longer an issue

[2022-12-10 19:29:08] <SiomoG> They should buff the time that ramattra shield stays up to six seconds
[2022-12-10 19:29:21] <%+plongsofplongolia> i also think taking away cc from other roles was also an issue
[2022-12-10 19:29:21] <ver1ser> @kpcool28 hook become the ult

[2022-12-10 20:25:51] <bofaoyl> im so seriously tired of roadhog. he can just one shot people and has way too much survivability and he should be taken out of the game. hog is an issue but the real offender is genji his ability  to do like 25 damage per shot whatever it is while having difficult movement and mechanics is oppressive and is ruining the game. hog doesnt hold a candle to how overpowered genji is and this mechnized ninja menace needs to be nerfed into oblivion. also buff mercy blaster...

I don't think OW will thrive as a casual game without some competitive aspect even wow classic of all things have logs to feel competition. Apex, Fortnite, csgo ect ect. All have a competitive aspect. Hope they fix OW eventually
[2022-12-10 22:15:59] <RandomDirt_> @Craig_Johnson_ Drops should still be going regardless if they show up or not. Just be sure to stay for the full duration and you'll see it check off eventually.

[2022-12-10 22:19:03] <+goblingoat_> hi guys i need some advice, i pretty much only play QP and every single game i get feels so unwinnable. for example, in my last game (i was playing ana) i had a mei who would literally run in and cryo herself in the middle of their team, my doom would literally run out of my LOS and blame me for him mispositioning and my other support had very little healing on kiriko and wasnt getting picks at all. im not gonna sit here and say im good at the game in the slightest but i dont think im this bad.

[2022-12-10 22:34:10] <Amhash1> @kiisure because then you could just get the top of each role and play together and pretty much be unbeatable
[2022-12-10 22:34:11] <DriekFan> @TxnRonin just learn every hero a bit and try picking counters.

[2022-12-10 22:59:44] <RhythmSeal> Maybe make the base time longer and give him the option that, if he holds the button longer, he can make the shield stronger but it lasts for a shorter amount of time. It'd be like a tradeoff depending on hoe much damage over how long of a stretch of time will be coming your way.

[2022-12-10 23:03:35] <dangerwhere> oh hi there tea MLADY
[2022-12-10 23:03:37] <iliketoeatpineapples> @SiomoG they don't need to nerf him but a rework will be much better. they keep "balancing" their heroes and it will just end up in swirling endless nerf - buff
[2022-12-10 23:03:37] <djzander_> @countsacula i think it more his dmg with his one shot potential and his healing
[2022-12-10 23:03:39] <aquagram> His hook is fine, but the healing almost requires you to completely team up on him or forced to change to Ana

[2022-12-10 23:03:43] <%+xxg0bl1nxx> I thought it was the 1 shot that was the issue

[2022-12-10 23:09:03] <cyber_xpert> Sometimes i think, that Lucio is  so easy to hook, cause he's to speedy at times. He can be predictable due to being to fast^^

[2022-12-10 23:09:33] <+alucard8732> Wild that Blizzard sees the lack of people wanting to play support as a problem and decide to make the role even worse. Enjoy hour long queues at high levels or being stuck with a plat support in top 500 games when everyone starts quitting support because you just get deleted over and over.  The incompetence of this studio is amazing.

[2022-12-10 23:20:34] <+Tasta08> heal CD is way too short and hook range is way too long

[2022-12-10 23:21:06] <%+flaccidgoop> could they make it so hog did less damage to damage/support roles so that hes made to be better against tanks than squishies?
[2022-12-10 23:21:08] <iliketoeatpineapples> damn!! old style brawl rein v rein  OMEGALUL

[2022-12-10 23:21:30] <%kanakuri_michaelmtg> @iliketoeatpineapples see, but it gets funnier. My stats for that game were 37 elims, 15K damage, new records across the board. I outplayed my team and the enemy team on Doom, didn't switch once. Meanwhile, this Hog was just feeding and feeding, running onto the point by himself into my entire team.
[2022-12-10 23:21:34] <NaveThaShade> axdragon1105 yeah but it'd help those two tanks maybe lower the damage a bit also

[2022-12-10 23:22:35] <NaveThaShade> I think if the Block had another animation to cancel sleep dart and hook but end the block animation it'd be a sick change
[2022-12-10 23:22:36] <ze_n__> what's everyone's opinion on push?

[2022-12-10 23:22:57] <iliketoeatpineapples> @kanakuri_michaelmtg there's nothing in being meta slave or playing meta. why do people think that OWL pro players plays the heroes that has been buff?  they're just coping and unable to kill a doom. that's all there is to it. don't mind them or just mute them MF-ers  OMEGALUL

[2022-12-10 23:23:18] <%sammcrank> @kazzuuu1 yep however so was reins pin. always notorious for one shot. but they decided to nerf his pin but not change hog

[2022-12-10 23:29:19] <cyganski_wojownik_lvl5> best way to nerf hog rn is just to make his vape have 20%damage res and change his hook back to 15m

[2022-12-10 23:30:20] <+NiftyFearless> @drdobotrobo Kiriko cancels her out
[2022-12-10 23:30:20] <tzeneth> @drdobotrobo Yes but Kiriko pushes the fight against the Ana plus lots of dive and flankers make her much more vulnerable

[2022-12-10 23:30:36] <%+BigNaCl> @drdobotrobo not anymore, if she anti heals him or sleeps him kiriko just pogs all over him and hes fine so your skilled ana play was pointless

[2022-12-10 23:35:53] <Aerlis1331> do you think adding a cast time to hook would help with hog at all? kind of like a doom punch, where you still have time to react to it, but its not getting rid of the one shot?

[2022-12-10 23:38:53] <kingmystery4492> @BigNaCl i might get the battlepass just for that skin and the zeus skin for junker queen

[2022-12-10 23:39:32] <jugatrix> @DocSleepsZzZz the animation could be him removeing the mask and burping real loud [would explain why he needs to wear the mask in the first place]

[2022-12-10 23:39:43] <tzeneth> The secret for me is, because I'm in the gold/plat area, that I just stopped caring and play semi-serious in comp (I give it my all) but I've stopped caring about winning or losing
[2022-12-10 23:39:44] <%jenn_orkidea> when is ramattra playable in comp btw? was it next week?

[2022-12-10 23:54:20] <%a_witcher> @SirMustacheo that would be too much imo .. with the new ult buff i already get 1-3 every ult .. another bomb would create too much space

[2022-12-10 23:59:03] <themaster31_13_32> hey flats where do you think reinhardt would be if they buffed firestrike damage to 100, buffed pin back to 300, and made it so that Whenever you attacked with your hammer you are boosted forward 1 meter
[2022-12-10 23:59:03] <soapbroker> they nerfed genji because of the dps passive but when they removed that they didnt put genji back
