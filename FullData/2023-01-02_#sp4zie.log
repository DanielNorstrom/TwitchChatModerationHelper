[2023-01-02 15:25:07] <@%MacYodaNL> For those who dont know the origins from Spuuz: He hates the loot system, he doesnt understand it and he "loves" all the Lore
[2023-01-02 15:25:08] <%AemenNae> im on 2017 xmas gifts right now
[2023-01-02 15:25:13] <NoergaardGuf> how do you have that much stuff on a lvl 48 acc?
[2023-01-02 15:25:25] <%fatboywithburger> very excited about the league, finally our region got finally included. Welcome us SEA!! ^_^
[2023-01-02 15:25:32] <%AemenNae> max was 30 back then
[2023-01-02 15:25:41] <+lllmrmooselll> Go unlock all the loot - u make me cringe so hard haha xD
[2023-01-02 15:25:41] <%byebuu> it was capped at lvl 30
[2023-01-02 15:25:45] <ZBowman> He's actually level 3,459,102 it was just before levels were a thing
[2023-01-02 15:25:51] <%+JustaurasLTU> Lets go watch the new vid on Otub while we wait?
[2023-01-02 15:25:52] <mykiltisplaid> yeah hahaha
[2023-01-02 15:26:02] <tyraekk> it was way easier to get essence tho
[2023-01-02 15:26:03] <%Charyptis> is there any way to know whih evel you would be???
[2023-01-02 15:26:15] <NoergaardGuf> you just started up a little while ago? (ive seen you alot many years ago)
[2023-01-02 15:26:20] <%+Wulfrykk> KINKS?!
[2023-01-02 15:26:21] <%AemenNae> new segment, kink explain
[2023-01-02 15:26:23] <%+Wulfrykk> LOOT KINK
[2023-01-02 15:26:24] VIEWERS: 568
[2023-01-02 15:26:29] <mykiltisplaid> loot kink
[2023-01-02 15:26:33] <@%MacYodaNL> And he never opened loot before, he had one video in where he rerolled 3 skin shards into the ugliest graves skin: Jailbreak @Sp4zie
[2023-01-02 15:26:47] <%AemenNae> defo a loot kink, look at the gloomhaven gold stealing gameplay
[2023-01-02 15:26:49] <eatoutofmyhand> How much bounce is there in your hair? Would a hand spring back, hypothetically?
[2023-01-02 15:26:56] <Steien> I can make sense of it, all the IP and Blue Essnece you had before the level system (Blue Essence was the current Orange Essence) Would be converted to the current Blue Essence. If D4ve is rich as fuck, its because he was rich with IP.
[2023-01-02 15:26:57] <%DwarfNugget> Clap
[2023-01-02 15:27:01] <tyraekk> Influence Points tho amirite? SeemsGood
[2023-01-02 15:27:26] <%AemenNae> wtf 2 shens
[2023-01-02 15:27:28] <%thereeldoge> I shart too :D
[2023-01-02 15:27:32] <@%MacYodaNL> Because you already own the champions
[2023-01-02 15:27:35] <+St1nkyStreamer> 3 singed shards? POG
[2023-01-02 15:27:44] <%+sophie1763> you can forge mastery 6 on ezreal
[2023-01-02 15:27:44] <%+kaaykun> can also combine 3 shards into a random champ
[2023-01-02 15:27:51] <+lllmrmooselll> U can use Ezreal to make him lvl 6 with the shard
[2023-01-02 15:27:52] <ZBowman> 🤔
[2023-01-02 15:27:55] <Juksteri> shards lowers the price of the champ, but u already have them all, so u can just get blues out of them
[2023-01-02 15:27:56] <%AemenNae> no
[2023-01-02 15:27:58] <%AemenNae> not at all
[2023-01-02 15:28:02] <BlooodyMace> tbh the system sucks and feel unrewarding
