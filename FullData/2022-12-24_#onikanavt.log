[2022-12-24 09:26:19] <%k_yama_> curry would be sauce or stew, but it happens to be made with lots of spices. but the definition is very loosely based because it really depends on which country's dish your making it. japanese curry that kana is making is a sauce that goes on rice

[2022-12-24 12:10:42] <%Order_of_Dusk> But yeah for anyone wondering why I say crypto is fundamentally useless is because it's impossible for it to be stable as the only thing backing the value of any given coin is nothing but the speculation that its value will increase, other types of investments are based on something be it a company, or property, etc. and money is tied to the stability and GDP of a given country
