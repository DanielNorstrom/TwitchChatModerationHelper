[2022-12-17 00:10:08] <+xMom_> if u want 1 auto atk on the last of ur 3 spenders the break point is 1765 spec
[2022-12-17 00:10:12] <HE911> Good evening @Baker

[2022-12-17 00:10:20] <+xMom_> and 1802 for no auto atk
[2022-12-17 00:10:23] <joelsvtore> nice i was thinking on bulding  CD over KBW
[2022-12-17 00:10:36] <+gonjg> my main is a Eso and the alter a Db one

[2022-12-17 00:11:20] <+matt3wjc> @xMom_ below 1765 what do you do? wait for sky shattering to be off cooldown? lol
[2022-12-17 00:12:14] VIEWERS: 3 555
[2022-12-17 00:12:16] <+xMom_> @matt3wjc  so  you weave in 1-3 extra auto atks into ur 3rd combo for blast formation
[2022-12-17 00:12:46] <+xMom_> it still feels pretty smooth
[2022-12-17 00:13:06] <%Jimotthy> Finally hit 1520 KEKL
[2022-12-17 00:13:17] <+xMom_> cause since u use 3 skills before blast formation u can comfortably weave in 1 auto per skill and it still feels pretty good
[2022-12-17 00:13:26] <%+Niki_xyOn> was not on you it seems
[2022-12-17 00:14:14] VIEWERS: 3 555
[2022-12-17 00:14:27] <+xMom_> u dont really need to go for the 1802 break point for no auto cause u have to wait for the blast formation cd even if u have lvl 10 cd gem if its a perfect combo
[2022-12-17 00:16:15] VIEWERS: 3 555
[2022-12-17 00:16:45] <+xMom_> oh its all good @Baker  i was just letting @matt3wjc  know i wasnt giving u advice haha
[2022-12-17 00:16:58] <+Krystaliq> Did u figure it out with the runes on striker?

[2022-12-17 17:59:21] <%+TrickmasteH> 4 has some serious face palm moments, where people just are not in the right position. I will admit so far, non swiftness classes in Gate 4, feels smodge.
