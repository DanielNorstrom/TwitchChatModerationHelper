[2023-01-03 15:20:21] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-03 15:25:54] <%+bulletbillmg> just do the movie trope where you dont move when you step on it then find something heavy enough to fool the mine when you step off of it

[2023-01-03 15:41:12] <@%PsyFreaker> repainting before selling a house is such a waste of money. the buyers will likely paint it over in the color they like anyway

[2023-01-03 15:46:44] <+MhmmDave> @fusegarage most people of drinking age in the UK will know of Bredog. but its a brewery, so 'it' being good depends on what one you try. they do lagers, IPAs, etc.

[2023-01-03 15:47:20] <+bl0c_kev> It depends if you bought the house with a kitchen or not. If it was old school, and you modernised it (not stupid colours) you will get the money back

[2023-01-03 15:47:27] <%+hellvision251> It helps slightly in US. More of a selling point though, depending on how much you spend
[2023-01-03 15:47:30] <%$fusegarage> punk iPa its what 8 have
[2023-01-03 15:47:36] <%+angier87> It’s not “master bath or master bedroom”it’s primary bath..

[2023-01-03 15:47:51] <%Strykkerrrr> @WhiskerB correct, Paul is right for the UK, of course in US with your annual property taxes etc its different.
[2023-01-03 15:47:52] <biggpuk> Are you gonna give the last of us a watch on sky tv this month.. it looks good
[2023-01-03 15:47:54] <%DefoAnoob> Its not about adding value, Its about making the House more presentable/desireable to potential buyers...
[2023-01-03 15:47:56] <@%MrMcGravyBaby> most houses in the UK dont have more than one Bath LUL
[2023-01-03 15:47:57] <%+TheOneAndOnlyCup> One counterpoint, £10k upfront is hugely different to adding it to a mortgage
[2023-01-03 15:48:01] <%sleepysteve69> Car value does not increase for new tires either!!
[2023-01-03 15:48:02] <%winniez84> get a kitchen from poland and shipped over. Then get some polish builders in to fit it, you will save atleast 50% on it trust me
[2023-01-03 15:48:03] <+AquaPulma> Or just sit on it for 5 years and double that money
[2023-01-03 15:48:04] <+MhmmDave> @fusegarage its a fairly popular one in the UK. I guess try it and see!

[2023-01-03 16:50:07] <%+rb5286> personal tax returns are OK, but business one's are a while different ball game! accountants are worth the £'s
[2023-01-03 16:50:09] <%TheZigorkyBarKid> @mrmcgravybaby A good accountant should be able to pay themselves out of what they save you….so the old saying goes

[2023-01-03 16:50:09] <+Ty_Nuggets> I do a lot of freelance and taxes are a massive pain. It's 100% worth it to just pay for an accountant
[2023-01-03 16:50:13] <$idealbicycle741> I used to do mine all the time. I think I used to do equal if not better than my current accountant but I just can't be arsed any more.

[2023-01-03 17:48:21] <%+j_wolf75> @thezigorkybarkid I get that. Lots of different, yet very specific roles for players in American Football.

[2023-01-03 20:25:33] <%pangolinja> DayZ is made for streaming. It gets better as streaming tech gets better, because it makes the best organic stories

[2023-01-03 20:51:14] <+KornDog84> I always wanted the tent to go on your back. Like a sling you make with a rope or something.
[2023-01-03 20:51:14] <+MarZ07> long time since i played, are cars still trash?
[2023-01-03 20:51:15] <paulypoobag> @Al you PC players. What is the oldest item in the game?.
[2023-01-03 20:51:20] <Yuuki_1221> m4 can easily fit in a decent size backpack with a collapsible stock.
[2023-01-03 20:51:22] <%Aldred2121> on console it's even worse, m4 in hunting pants
[2023-01-03 20:51:24] <%$MattyB1215> Rifle sling should go at the chest slot
[2023-01-03 20:51:24] <%+Lunchbox138> The sling needs to be an attachment that allows you to carry on your back
[2023-01-03 20:51:24] <+dystopian13> Should need a sling
[2023-01-03 20:51:26] <%cervik111cze> or make it longer to drawn from bacpack ?

[2023-01-03 20:51:34] <%+Derangedrebel> @reaper9o7 Something like an added gun scabbard for a couple backpacks
[2023-01-03 20:51:34] <scumm7> The Arma2 DayZ had guns that you couldn't use a backpack with.

[2023-01-03 20:54:58] <%reaper9o7> Best to go into a gas zone for a better chance at a keycard
[2023-01-03 20:55:00] <paulypoobag> i play on xbox. but it was Frankie on pc that got me into the game. i dreamt of it coming to console and whe it did i was the happiest 43 year old in the world lol

[2023-01-03 20:56:14] <%+TheJackBull18> @paulypoobag do you think the KOS issue with Xbox is that so many people are in a party chat and cant VOIP so there is less talk and more shooting?
[2023-01-03 20:56:16] <%uncle__rucku5> didn't think you'd still be on my twitch stopped working g for several hours now

[2023-01-03 20:56:28] <drrawdawg> when I found the key card was by luck I got lost in the woods and popped out at a convoy
[2023-01-03 20:56:46] <reevO2600hz> @paulypoobag i think the pc community is just more historied with this game so theres diff etiquette(mostly)

[2023-01-03 20:57:25] <+worms12a> does anybody know how many Convoys there are at the same time on chernarus?
[2023-01-03 20:57:32] <scumm7> That or they should mark the location so people can go fight over it.
[2023-01-03 20:57:33] <drrawdawg> I'd say lower the spawn points for it cause they do have a lot
[2023-01-03 20:57:34] <%$SourSkuLLz> The underground loot doesn't justify the rarity of the keycard imo
[2023-01-03 20:57:41] <bandikooper> The unlimited pipsi gets me.. lol short press to drink and release  and the can opening glitches everytime. Is this still a thing?
[2023-01-03 20:57:50] <reevO2600hz> yeah ive seen base building in bunkers on base servers still

[2023-01-03 20:58:46] <scumm7> Something like if you carry a radio and its on you get a message that the convoy has been spotted near such and such.

[2023-01-03 21:16:48] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-03 21:52:51] <%+nambino2000> it's very expensive... especially for a 60 slot server... in Canada it's over $200/month
[2023-01-03 21:52:57] <%+MarkDaGod69> on Xbox at least there are servers that give you ingame gear and q priority. I even had an admin tell me "ill give you your life back for a discord dono" I quit that server

[2023-01-03 21:53:08] <%yayxx> On some servers You can buy que priority. Wonder how is that allowed.
[2023-01-03 21:53:10] <cootasha> on xbox it worked out around a £1 per slot per month

[2023-01-03 21:53:40] <%+nambino2000> also if you want a better server hosting it, better PC specs, it costs even more
[2023-01-03 21:53:42] <@%Unclefood> Chat, what happens when they run out of priority queue slots on a 60 player server? You wait in a different queue? NO one else gets (the poors)? They idea is bullshit

[2023-01-03 22:51:49] <@%Unclefood> @lun2568 Infected in larger towns have a static number and then add more based on how many players are near, I think smaller towns might just have them spawn in with players

[2023-01-03 22:55:33] <%RaggedFlag> @neoalchemist74  For the most part, fibers and starch are complex carbs, while sugars are simple carbs.
[2023-01-03 22:55:40] <AwesomeLizard> i think its all to do with the distilling and filtering
[2023-01-03 22:55:41] <%DoinWork369> its what's the alcohol its made from
[2023-01-03 22:55:43] <%cervik111cze> baylies  ? :ú
[2023-01-03 22:55:46] <%MR_Kessler> There are several ways to make alcohol free beer. One is to brew beer with alcohol and the take out the alcohol. This one has more taste then brewing the beer with less procent
[2023-01-03 22:55:48] <+ELcup> alcohol gets burned by the body and does become energy which is calories, it's metabolized differently so it's not on the nutrition facts, i think
[2023-01-03 22:55:54] <Afalin> LUL logic
[2023-01-03 22:55:58] <ztr33m> its 7kcal per 1g of Alcohol, its a macronutrient
[2023-01-03 22:55:59] <%DefoAnoob> Calories in beer come from starches and carbs
[2023-01-03 22:55:59] <%+Derangedrebel> 60% is water
[2023-01-03 22:56:01] <idkwhatuseriwant> anyone know how ads work with vods not complaining just curious because sometimes i get lots and other times i get none so i don’t really get it
[2023-01-03 22:56:01] <mistersvensk> alcohol can drive a car
[2023-01-03 22:56:02] <$SpliffLivingston> Less ingredients in hard liquor than beers typically

[2023-01-03 22:56:04] <%+slybacon79> Higher proof = higher caloris
[2023-01-03 22:56:04] <tn22ah> when the sugar turns to alcohol its no longer that much calories inside
[2023-01-03 22:56:04] <@%Unclefood> @TheRunningManZ There was a 'bulldozer control' tab in the options at one point
[2023-01-03 22:56:04] <Fish_B0ne> I think its just that the more alcohol the less you give a fack LUL
[2023-01-03 22:56:05] <%+H00dieNinj4> beer is different than spirits. acholi and carbs is what gives you calories in beer
[2023-01-03 22:56:07] <@%^Nightbot> TRMZ releases a new video every week on YT, you can go and see highlights of his adventures here: youtube.com/therunningmanz
[2023-01-03 22:56:07] <%neoalchemist74> You are right Paul the calories are from left over sugar from the fermentation process
[2023-01-03 22:56:08] <%$ki11phil> its about the sugar
[2023-01-03 22:56:09] <%+galasteve> Alcohol accounts for 2/3 or calories in wine/beer/cider.  The other 1/3 is from sugars
[2023-01-03 22:56:12] <%SUPERSCHMINN> I'm not science
[2023-01-03 22:56:17] <%$Ya_Boi_Moox> I think it’s the yeast in the beer give you the calories
[2023-01-03 22:56:17] <%+notreallyoverit> the body metabolises alcohol into energy
[2023-01-03 22:56:17] <+ky_sharpless> Alcohol has 7 calories per gram. So the higher the alcohol content the higher the calories

[2023-01-03 23:40:44] <Darkgaleon> it depends aswell on how long your character has been alive (i've heard) makes it go down slower
