[2022-12-31 15:04:58] <%Weawulf> Gwent lived a long ass time if you really think about it

[2022-12-31 15:05:15] <Smiku8> @rrslayer34 I didn't like their new stuff anyway cayse it was too OP. I hope they balance at least before stoping new content

[2022-12-31 15:06:01] <jarragorn> @Smiku8 well after they quit they want to give the players the tools to balance the game themselves, but they havent said how yet.
[2022-12-31 15:06:34] <Smiku8> @jarragorn Wow! That's interesting!
