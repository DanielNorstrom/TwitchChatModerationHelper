[2022-12-24 09:47:42] <%Criptonix100> Bwop @Zeroslayer
[2022-12-24 09:47:59] <%Zeroslayer> @Criptonix100 Bwop <3
[2022-12-24 09:48:19] <%Criptonix100> Steam sale is really bad right now :(
[2022-12-24 09:48:52] <%Criptonix100> the only game I would buy is either NieR Replicant (which I played the 2010 Gestalt ver) or GW2 EoD lol
[2022-12-24 09:48:54] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah I'm even tempted and I bought all the ff games a while ago.
[2022-12-24 09:49:37] <%Criptonix100> listening to 'that' song every day makes me replay NieR
[2022-12-24 09:49:50] <%Zeroslayer> NieR is good but as you have played a previous version. Maybe EoD would be more exciting?
[2022-12-24 09:50:23] <%Criptonix100> idk they destroyed the GW2 franchise after ICB
[2022-12-24 09:50:29] <%Criptonix100> it became like WoW :(
[2022-12-24 09:51:30] <%Criptonix100> ICB was meant to be GW:EotN but we got no answers to Primordus or even to Jormag and I was like "really anet?"
[2022-12-24 09:52:00] <%Criptonix100> is EoD story good?
[2022-12-24 09:53:03] <%Zeroslayer> Uhh I wouldn't know as I still didn't know much french at the time of playing through half of it. And I got bored of it quickly because I had just grinded the skyscale and the griffon before that.
[2022-12-24 09:53:18] <%Criptonix100> KEKW
[2022-12-24 09:53:23] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah
[2022-12-24 09:53:25] <%Criptonix100> lmao
[2022-12-24 09:53:42] <%Zeroslayer> I was just fucking tired of playing GW2. But I'll get back... eventually.
[2022-12-24 09:53:59] <%Zeroslayer> Now I can at least actually read some of what's going on and understand it.
[2022-12-24 09:54:41] <%Zeroslayer> I did however enjoy the path of fire story the most even just the base expansion story without the living world story.
[2022-12-24 09:54:52] <%Criptonix100> if you play GW:EotN you'll be surprised how good it is but now every Warcraft dev is probably layed off :(
[2022-12-24 09:55:06] <%Criptonix100> yeah PoF is the best imo
[2022-12-24 09:56:02] <%Criptonix100> that's why we don't really get good story anymore because the devil NCSoft layed off ANet staff
[2022-12-24 09:56:14] <%Zeroslayer> Sadge
[2022-12-24 09:56:38] <%Zeroslayer> Never liked NCsoft's way of business. But it is what it is.
[2022-12-24 09:57:28] <%Zeroslayer> Wanna hear a little fun story about another game they published?
[2022-12-24 09:57:51] <%Criptonix100> which one? Aion?
[2022-12-24 09:58:11] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah.
[2022-12-24 09:58:14] <%Criptonix100> I miss the old days of L2
[2022-12-24 09:58:44] <%Criptonix100> and they destroyed it with the F2P model at GoD...the goddes was pretty destructive KEKW
[2022-12-24 09:59:16] <%Criptonix100> if you don't understand the F2P patch was named Goddess of Destruction...yeah pretty destructive
[2022-12-24 09:59:21] <%Zeroslayer> Basically I had heard you could just subscribe to the game and game-time would only go down when playing... 5 months later and we found out the hard way that my dad had been charged for all 5 months in a row KEKW
[2022-12-24 09:59:41] <%Criptonix100> wtf....
[2022-12-24 09:59:48] <%Zeroslayer> Then I stopped playing KEKL
[2022-12-24 09:59:51] <%Criptonix100> wow that's ass to NCSoft...
[2022-12-24 10:00:19] <%Criptonix100> btw NieR Gestalt didn't had Ending E :P
[2022-12-24 10:00:31] <%Zeroslayer> I din't think it's specificly NCSoft that said that.
[2022-12-24 10:00:32] <%Criptonix100> neither the og NieR Replicant
[2022-12-24 10:00:40] <%Zeroslayer> But it's funny nonetheless.
[2022-12-24 10:01:06] <%Criptonix100> well NCSoft is the publisher and developer of L2 and Aion so...
[2022-12-24 10:01:10] <%Criptonix100> it should be KEKW
[2022-12-24 10:01:53] <%Zeroslayer> Well I can't remember if they said it or something got mistranslated where I read/heard it from.
[2022-12-24 10:02:12] <%Zeroslayer> Wouldn't be too out of the question if they actually did however.
[2022-12-24 10:02:13] <%Criptonix100> can't wait how bad ArcheAge 2 will be *cough* I mean Arche Desert Online *cough*
[2022-12-24 10:02:50] <%Zeroslayer> I'm not touching ArcheAge 2 with a pole with the length of the milky way.
[2022-12-24 10:03:08] <%Criptonix100> anyway...back to EoD...I didn't find the elite specs too good even
[2022-12-24 10:03:28] <%Zeroslayer> I was one of the idiots that bought the "founders packs"
[2022-12-24 10:03:42] <%Zeroslayer> And I quit during alpha cus I could see the problems already starting there.
[2022-12-24 10:04:07] <%Criptonix100> of ArcheAge?
[2022-12-24 10:04:11] <%Criptonix100> yeah...
[2022-12-24 10:04:14] <%Zeroslayer> Yup
[2022-12-24 10:04:19] <%Criptonix100> atleast 1.0 was fun
[2022-12-24 10:04:31] <%Zeroslayer> I have even deleted my trion account. Cus fuck that.
[2022-12-24 10:04:34] <%Criptonix100> when that potion came it was all over
[2022-12-24 10:05:02] <%Criptonix100> it's funny because Trion isn't trion anymore
[2022-12-24 10:05:08] <%Criptonix100> it's Gaming
[2022-12-24 10:05:12] <%Criptonix100> gamingo*
[2022-12-24 10:05:14] <%Zeroslayer> Stare
[2022-12-24 10:05:24] <%Zeroslayer> Fuck gamigo as well Stare
[2022-12-24 10:05:51] <%Zeroslayer> All I remember is that it was a hassle to delete my account.
[2022-12-24 10:06:25] <%Zeroslayer> I would also do it for my BDO account but I'm too lazy do it now cus it's even more of a hassle.
[2022-12-24 10:06:40] <%Criptonix100> LMAO
[2022-12-24 10:07:39] <%Criptonix100> Deleting Pearl Abyss Account (Savage)
[2022-12-24 10:07:55] <%Criptonix100> did you transfer btw?
[2022-12-24 10:08:21] <%Criptonix100> if not then you are fine that you wanted to delete it because it's pretty much gone
[2022-12-24 10:08:53] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah I did transfer... which I really shouldn't have done.
[2022-12-24 10:09:14] <%Criptonix100> well time to do the savage part then KEKW
[2022-12-24 10:09:35] <%Zeroslayer> I'll just leave it be Stare
[2022-12-24 10:10:51] <%Criptonix100> It's sad that strimmer won't try NieR Gestalt/Replicant because of Automota :(
[2022-12-24 10:11:35] <%Criptonix100> I'm still listening to the Shadowlord theme on repeat rofl
[2022-12-24 10:13:22] <%Criptonix100> btw I wonder how you will react to the Firebrand changes that they have done when you'll log back in GW2
[2022-12-24 10:15:27] <%Zeroslayer> Well I gotta go. Cya later Bwop <3
[2022-12-24 10:15:32] <%Criptonix100> Cya
