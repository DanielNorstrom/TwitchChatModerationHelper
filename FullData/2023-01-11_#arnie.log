[2023-01-11 11:12:25] <rand0m111> they talked about one guy in the server as an owner so im not sure whats the deal between them
[2023-01-11 11:12:26] <@%bw0_s> @deniof he owns the brand Nopixel not the spain server

[2023-01-11 11:12:36] <revenge_iscool> Right cause he doesn’t own the Indian server either
[2023-01-11 11:12:53] <revenge_iscool> He just owns the brand right
[2023-01-11 11:13:01] <@%Dezzybtw> so i guess they are contracted to be able to use the nopixel name?
