[2023-01-02 17:22:14] <%DhufishHunter> @remiri there is a special absolutely balanced set up using dusk crown ring and being cursed to reduce your HP. Then the health regen from a shield called the sanctus can match the health drain from power within exactly so you can stay in rtsr range for 100 seconds. In the 4 kings fight you lose the ability to equip dusk crown ring since you need the other ring or you die.
[2023-01-02 17:22:14] <%gateweave> KENW
[2023-01-02 17:22:18] <LCorazza> Yeah, if you half your health you half the damage from PW. Then the shield helps it to regen
[2023-01-02 17:22:20] <+nostromo_49> i still have the starting short sword
[2023-01-02 17:22:29] <+nostromo_49> it makes me sadge
[2023-01-02 17:22:35] <LCorazza> You can do that by cursing yourself. The shield is from an invader before Nito
