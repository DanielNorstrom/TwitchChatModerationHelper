[2022-12-30 16:21:37] <%FalconzxP> probably not much because they jack up the prices of everything

[2022-12-30 16:21:47] <+thesaddestberg> It‚Äôs actually not Uber that necessarily loses the money. It‚Äôs the restaurants. Uber makes its money from the fees and the mark ups that the restos have to put on the food they‚Äôre selling through that platform

[2022-12-30 16:22:38] <+thesaddestberg> Also the resto doesn‚Äôt get paid by order. They get a monthly check which often utterly fucks then over as it‚Äôs not consistent income that the resto ecosystem needs to survive alot of the time
[2022-12-30 16:22:40] <%$Prosauceee> I have NEVER gotten my order when I used UberEats. Doordash always delivers but sometimes its missing or wrong altogether. They do give refunds tho
[2022-12-30 16:22:44] <+merrilldaman> If you make a new doordash account they give you to 40% coupons everytime
