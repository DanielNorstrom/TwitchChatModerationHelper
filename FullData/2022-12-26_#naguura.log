[2022-12-26 15:09:29] <mystralwastaken> I feel like Moonkin has the problem that they either play a 3m cooldown (which is big yikes) or a 2m cooldown. Most other classes have lower cooldown burst rotations

[2022-12-26 15:11:47] <alexchacel> both spriest and moonkin are doing Mid in mythic + there's far worst classes
[2022-12-26 15:11:51] <HairClog> I don‚Äôt think there is a wrong way to play a veng dh
[2022-12-26 15:11:52] <+roshii90> They probably need to address the rest paladin tree and spec. People been unhappy with it since the talents come out
[2022-12-26 15:12:08] <Blauschneewunsch> @Naguura What do you think about the current stage of Dev. Evoker?
[2022-12-26 15:12:13] <%KurodaTsu> lol @Yx3l I'm being coaxed into play resto by frineds and I don't even heal. It's so busted atm. Really would like to try some other druid spec eventually :P
[2022-12-26 15:12:17] <+cr0ckp0tt> can u still get that bear skin the tank has?
[2022-12-26 15:12:33] <@%Kuroz> only the fel one
[2022-12-26 15:12:33] <+The_Biscuit_Man_1309> @cr0ckp0tt only the fel one from mage tower
[2022-12-26 15:12:46] <mystralwastaken> What are they changing it to?
[2022-12-26 15:12:47] <+ra391> whats being changed with solar beam sorry?
[2022-12-26 15:12:47] <RevivedCoyote> what are they changing?
[2022-12-26 15:13:00] <%TheAlphaYeti> @love_eggplant As soon as they make playing melee in dungeons/raids less lethal compared to being at range, they can nerf us all they want. It's our compensation for being in melee range KEKW
[2022-12-26 15:13:02] <Wasril> they just have to chance trents and solar beam and we fine
[2022-12-26 15:13:03] <+laddergoat_> Chat: Firemage M+ ? Yay or Nay?  And why is it Nay ?
[2022-12-26 15:13:06] <%Orcan3> Kicks should just be baseline and not in the trees.. or something that makes the kicks better i guess
[2022-12-26 15:13:12] <+Xumkin> i find the moonkin rotation just just be a lot and i go back to feral :)

[2022-12-26 15:16:56] <%Azikielboi> so they should nerf moonkin 4piece @Naguura ?
[2022-12-26 15:16:58] <justjoeyokay> @jamie95 if that's your first chat message, how do youknow that's all she does?

[2022-12-26 17:26:57] <FpsAcacious> and buffs dmg
[2022-12-26 17:26:58] <nikcs> yes it does, but if you are at like 10 stacks its quite abit of dmg
[2022-12-26 17:27:03] <zapor124> Facts
[2022-12-26 17:27:04] <+famir123> well it gives u a dmg taken increase aswell

[2022-12-26 17:27:31] <archamenell> balls do NOT deal dmg according to the stacks you have. read the spell before backseating

[2022-12-26 17:27:38] <zapor124> and healer should be 1st prio for the balls imo

[2022-12-26 19:05:50] <soge131> Hmmm, kind of hard to balances some fights, If prot warrior is the only one to reflect dmg to bosses, I mean, his dmg scales with the key while everyone else's dont

[2022-12-26 19:10:20] <xxchefxxx> The game also wouldn‚Äôt be fun if everything was piss easy
[2022-12-26 19:10:22] <%+Ironwelder> i think all char should get baseline, then everything should be determined by Gear.
[2022-12-26 19:10:23] <%Twigbot4k> make everyone un-OP, for laughs.
[2022-12-26 19:10:24] <+Seerion> also, wtf is the point of playing if it's easy?

[2022-12-26 19:10:40] <Jabrah> when stuff is more balanced, skill becomes the main factor in dps instead of class decision
[2022-12-26 19:10:44] <%Anelit21> And if you play the class that is good, you are helping the team.

[2022-12-26 20:17:31] <soge131> It's something like a weekly quest that you can complete with any alt (just one, not all of them) but no more details
[2022-12-26 20:17:35] <dandlion> probably valdrakken intro quest
[2022-12-26 20:17:48] <%forgebearded> People are mad anytime they have to play the game to get something. They want it for logging in haha

[2022-12-26 20:17:56] <+Romub> Before you had to do Thaldraszus story line for spark on alt. But they fix it
[2022-12-26 20:18:03] <+ZappCatt> According to Icy Veins, no info on where it is and: However, the currency has not yet been added to the game, and the conversion costs remain unknown.
[2022-12-26 20:18:15] <mackxnen> people being mad?! no waaay
[2022-12-26 20:18:22] <+emozombiemonkey> From icy veins: "When the Inspiration Catalyst becomes available in Dragonflight Mythic+ Season 1, there will be a weekly quest that requires doing the same sorts of group content that provide you with Catalyst-eligible gear.  All characters on your WoW account can contribute progress towards completing the quest. Completing the quest awards 1 charge to all current and future characters on your account. You can have a maximum of 6 charges per character. Each of your characters can spend charge
