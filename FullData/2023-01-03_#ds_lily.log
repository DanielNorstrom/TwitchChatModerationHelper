[2023-01-03 00:36:07] <@%Kuglorf> In September, 1896, cumulonimbus, the greatest cloud in the world, was listed as Cloud 9 in a new cloud classification, and so to be on cloud nine became like floating on the tallest cloud on Earth. The story began with Sir Ralph Abercromby, who became fascinated by meteorology while serving in the British Army.

[2023-01-03 18:22:01] <%Ragabosh> It can be hard to tell, but sherbet differs from sorbet in that it's made with fruit, water and dairy. Whether it's milk or heavy cream, sherbet gets its lush creaminess from some added dairy.
