[2023-01-04 09:50:45] <imweszzz> @St0rmy66 I think before you make the decision you should scout. I personally think sunfire feels better, but if you don't need anti heal and the enemy runs a lot of AD bramble would be better if you need antiheal or they have a lot of AP just slam sunfire

[2023-01-04 12:01:16] <%Jarone__> @Hakuna_Matities It's all up to you, if you want a few more frames and can mis the 100$ I guess it's worth. But can't really give you advice this is a decision you have to make on your own bud
