[2022-12-25 00:02:53] <+Nayden10> does she summon a copy since the card costs "0" mana ?
[2022-12-25 00:02:53] <cizuss> @Nayden10 it shouldn't
[2022-12-25 00:03:06] <%MeatiHS> Pasco just thought he could gain a small advantage from roping
[2022-12-25 00:03:10] <+HeavyMetalGoat> @Nayden10 it does
[2022-12-25 00:03:12] <cizuss> it takes into account cost, mana or health
[2022-12-25 00:03:30] <cizuss> but i might be wrong, never tested it

[2022-12-25 00:07:05] <+Orckefeller> don't be so quick to sacrifice your daughter, consider sacrificing your son instead for instance
[2022-12-25 00:07:09] <CheekyApe> it's the means in the end
[2022-12-25 00:07:16] <adyblk> think about the memes

[2022-12-25 00:07:34] <limp3324> Lifecoach roped every turn and no one cared, people made fun of it. Or was this guy roping just to rope?

[2022-12-25 00:08:52] <CheekyApe> lol no, I want to hear the lamentations of the widows of my vanquished HS foes
[2022-12-25 00:08:54] <grimBleeper> PepoG stannis was a roper so he was morally evil and destined to fail
[2022-12-25 00:08:59] <TheAtheistGod> @snoop_frfr opp had seen the whole combo.
[2022-12-25 00:09:14] <boredtodeath> I sometimes emote "well played" after doing first half and then wait for them to concede. Kappa

[2022-12-25 01:36:19] <@^Nightbot> Hands have been doing really well lately. Started doing using new pain management strategies in June of 2019 and have been doing really well. Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-25 04:23:50] <zeroxhaust> No hands, the problem is that all the big shonen animes have gotten too formulaic, e.g. demon slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen.  However, really can't recommend Chainsaw Man. It's a novel take on the genre.
