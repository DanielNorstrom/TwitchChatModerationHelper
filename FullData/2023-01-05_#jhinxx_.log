[2023-01-05 10:25:08] <%Ziiltch> i dont drink coffee because i want to avoid the addiction
[2023-01-05 10:25:12] <@%$Catmeleon> yeah sounds like withdrawal
[2023-01-05 10:25:14] <Xzii> Withdrawls can cause headaches, but typically takes a LOT of days in a row of caffeine for most people and cutting cold turkey
[2023-01-05 10:25:17] <%Ziiltch> also it takes bad
[2023-01-05 10:25:27] <CosmicSpaceDolphin> you get headaches after drinking it everyday

[2023-01-05 10:25:30] <%JarofNutella_> Caffine itself can cause withdraws if you have too much over a long period of time.

[2023-01-05 16:45:00] <%Dorover> @redshodow The king has some special stuff yeah, but if they die a new one is selected so killing/protecting the king isn't a win condition. The king can be a bad guy too.
