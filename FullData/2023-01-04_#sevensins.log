[2023-01-04 10:44:26] <frankthemagpie> it sucks, but the holiday was amazing, went kayaking and saw stingrays, went beach rock hopping and there was a mass beaching of jellyfish, a very toxic variety, so that was cool, also saw some amazing beach landscapes around a part of my country I'd never been, so all in all, worth the drop in signal

[2023-01-04 10:54:12] <dracodai> Ardyn is such a insanely well written character.
[2023-01-04 10:54:30] <%phxforce> Ardyn was robbed
[2023-01-04 10:54:33] <%Lonefellow> It seems that whatever happened - the intro to the game was the biggest issue.
[2023-01-04 10:54:49] <%Lonefellow> Which is why it was cut in turned into a movie and the story changed so it begins as a road trip instead of an escape
[2023-01-04 10:54:58] <%Lonefellow> cut and turned*
[2023-01-04 10:55:16] <frankthemagpie> does he give you Kefka vibes? I haven't played 6 but I kinda feel like ardyn goes down the mad ruler scorched earth
[2023-01-04 10:55:46] <%Lonefellow> Oh, yeah. If you remember the Versus XIII trailer from like 2011, it featured the beginning Insomnia parts almost entirely

[2023-01-04 11:27:07] <%Lonefellow> Understandable

[2023-01-04 12:59:02] <%XyFreak> building up xp and then multiplying it at a hotel is fun

[2023-01-04 13:00:08] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, the other party members were made when the team had a better grasp of their own battle system so they almost feel more polished
[2023-01-04 13:00:12] <%+Toby_1_Kenobi> I'm curious about the DLC episodes for this game, because I never got into them. Are they separate chapters "started from a menu" of weaved into the story as story chapters? Are they included in this Fiesta run?
[2023-01-04 13:00:30] <DaRealHizza> @Toby_1_Kenobi separate chapters and they are amazing !

[2023-01-04 13:01:28] <Skyblueaqua> @Toby_1_Kenobi the DLC are based on when the party members leave the party for a bit
[2023-01-04 13:01:40] <%XyFreak> ardyn was the "fuck up the city" dlc
[2023-01-04 13:01:44] <+LevoGames> episode ardyn is so cool
[2023-01-04 13:01:50] <Skyblueaqua> episode Arden is insanely good
[2023-01-04 13:01:52] <%+Toby_1_Kenobi> @DaRealHizza I've heard good things about them. I liked the game when it came out. But as discussed, the first playthrough was kind of tainted... And now I don't really have the time to get into the game anymore.
[2023-01-04 13:02:14] <%CynniUniflame> Ignis DLC sure spoils EVERYTHING
[2023-01-04 13:02:18] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, you don't want to play Ignis right after Ignis leaves.
[2023-01-04 13:02:48] <Skyblueaqua> yeah they messed up with not spoiling the story in episode ignis

[2023-01-04 13:33:40] <DaRealHizza> streetfighter 5 which was really good online and pretty balanced dropped the ball with the als updat making the game super imbalanced and making lots of earlier viable chars just no viable anymore for ranked

[2023-01-04 14:02:12] <+LevoGames> What will happen with Yuffie's playstyle without the synergy Seven? What do you think?
[2023-01-04 14:02:13] <stalkor> im joking
[2023-01-04 14:02:22] <%TidusZecht> xjesta, do you say that having have beaten him? several times? on multiple playthroughs? your own save file? without seeing him before?
[2023-01-04 14:02:27] <+Drakorious> my brains wired funny where i can watch a game ive never played before , and only remember vague things about it so when i play myself its a whole brand new experience
[2023-01-04 14:02:31] <stalkor> can i donate negative moneys? :D
[2023-01-04 14:02:34] <%TidusZecht> or did you just watch a big streamer do it once?

[2023-01-04 14:52:15] <%Lonefellow> Oh, you know what? The last memory I have of this game is doing the Assasin's Creed event and honestly? That was a damn good event! sevenHype
[2023-01-04 14:52:18] <!%yrvengalied> i see we are already at chapter 5 i think ?
[2023-01-04 14:52:45] <Mongobeef> the cup noodle sponsorship is funny but...lord just how many does this game have?
[2023-01-04 14:53:00] <%Lonefellow> You could jump on the Lestallum roofs and everything. Too bad that event is no longer a thing.
[2023-01-04 14:53:04] <!%yrvengalied> doing good it raining and the weather is cold how i like it
[2023-01-04 14:53:15] <%Selnica> I'd assume no one has pushed the line enough on that yet. tho some companies are certainly trying
[2023-01-04 14:53:15] <Mongobeef> Child so angry it is breaking the textures
[2023-01-04 14:53:28] VIEWERS: 476
[2023-01-04 14:53:30] <!%yrvengalied> is the Royal version seven ?
[2023-01-04 14:53:31] <%Selnica> *cough* EA
[2023-01-04 14:53:57] <!%yrvengalied> yup its popping in and out
[2023-01-04 14:54:15] <!%yrvengalied> pre-renders ? and in game renders ?
[2023-01-04 14:54:18] <%Lonefellow> I don't remember it being like that. There WERE some funky things in the game (it's open world after all) but not that
[2023-01-04 14:54:35] <!%yrvengalied> peepoSad
[2023-01-04 14:54:44] <!%yrvengalied> Seven why peepoSad
[2023-01-04 14:54:47] <%Lonefellow> Yeah. They should have honestly included that whole cutscene in the game, not this stripped down thing
[2023-01-04 14:55:10] <!%yrvengalied> tbh i thought this is what i would play i was hyped af
[2023-01-04 14:55:31] <Mongobeef> Of all the things Final Fantasy shouldn't have done...running with FF15's combat...good, they really thought that was the best they had
[2023-01-04 14:55:31] VIEWERS: 476
[2023-01-04 14:55:33] <%GanD988> why that feels so out of contest ?
[2023-01-04 14:55:37] <%Lonefellow> This game had a TON of marketing when it came out. It definitely helped the game out as it felt like a proper event
[2023-01-04 14:55:40] <RomaniStudios> I was blessed by not seeing any of the trailers
[2023-01-04 14:55:46] <!%yrvengalied> i still like FF15 but yea didnt get marketed will and was over hyped AF
[2023-01-04 14:55:48] <Mongobeef> Like how do you do worse than Kingdom hearts combat?
[2023-01-04 14:56:03] <%Lonefellow> The anime

[2023-01-04 14:56:24] <%Amylou14> didnt they spend a huge chunk of money on food to?
[2023-01-04 14:56:26] <%+kaspauf> I never saw Kings Glaive... did you Seven?
[2023-01-04 14:56:26] <+Queenofb00tie510> yea, they over overhyped it ..didn't work
[2023-01-04 14:56:28] <Mongobeef> just BLOWING money left and right and NOTHING left for game dev
[2023-01-04 14:56:29] <%Selnica> **model
[2023-01-04 14:56:58] <+Queenofb00tie510> and I'm glad I did not waste any of my monies on it
[2023-01-04 14:56:59] <%Amylou14> All the canceled DLC
[2023-01-04 14:57:01] <Mongobeef> literally added cutscenes from the movie to the game POST game release
[2023-01-04 14:57:32] VIEWERS: 486
[2023-01-04 14:57:40] <%+Reinhoc> The canceled DLC definitely pissed me off
[2023-01-04 14:57:45] <!%yrvengalied> basically they had bad planning , execution and bypassed alot of steps and wanted to go to the end result
[2023-01-04 14:57:55] <%S4nG0> I bought the Royal Edition thinking it would be all on disc, except I got the base game disc and a voucher to redeem the DLC content. I was pissed LUL
[2023-01-04 14:58:14] <%blakey95uk> I never finished this ff, I got to the leviathan fight I think and I wasn't expecting to beat it by pressing certain buttons compared to the trailer sevenNani
[2023-01-04 14:58:32] <%Amylou14> Didn't they apologize for FFXIV?
[2023-01-04 14:58:45] <!%yrvengalied> the Leviathon fight in Vanilla was WAY better
[2023-01-04 14:59:01] <%Amylou14> Ahhh i always wondered about that
[2023-01-04 14:59:10] <!%yrvengalied> LOVED THAT
[2023-01-04 14:59:21] <%blakey95uk> However i am excited for the new final fantasy, hoping it releases for xbox

[2023-01-04 14:59:39] <%S4nG0> They gambled hard for FFXIV, but it was worth it
[2023-01-04 14:59:45] <%Lonefellow> I think 7 remake already did that
[2023-01-04 14:59:46] <@%XyPara> doesn't fun. MrDestructoid
[2023-01-04 14:59:46] <@%Eymas> FFXIV 1.0's "reboot" was even included in the lore, in the sense of "well, rocks fall and the world's fuck, here's a new one where everything's fixed"
[2023-01-04 14:59:54] <%Lonefellow> LMAO PARA
[2023-01-04 14:59:54] <%Lonefellow> HAHAHAHAH
[2023-01-04 15:00:01] <!%yrvengalied> i died the 1st time too with the leviathan fight

[2023-01-04 15:00:05] <Mongobeef> Oh I certainly hope so...cause...CHAOS was a shitshow too

[2023-01-04 15:00:43] <Mongobeef> especially if they pull the same "if you stream this game we'll slam your channel into the floor"
[2023-01-04 15:00:47] <%Amylou14> @Eymas I hate that because new players don't get the lore drop legacy players get
[2023-01-04 15:00:49] <%spectr0nn> @Mongobeef if you mean FF Origins, that wasnt developed by SE themselves tho
[2023-01-04 15:00:56] <%MasterVGuides> Square Enix could have a huge year in 2023.
[2023-01-04 15:01:01] <%Selnica> i hate it when doesn't fun. sevenBeg
[2023-01-04 15:01:06] <%S4nG0> Was FF Origins that bad?
[2023-01-04 15:01:06] <%+i_am_balthier> Will you still play ff7r in the fiesta?
[2023-01-04 15:01:21] <%spectr0nn> nah i think many ppl still liked Origins
[2023-01-04 15:01:24] <!%yrvengalied> @Mongobeef that was done by Koei Tehcmo
[2023-01-04 15:01:26] <%MasterVGuides> Pixel Remasters on console, FFXVI, FF7 Rebirth...
[2023-01-04 15:01:27] <%Lonefellow> @Amylou14 I actually like that. Those players stuck with the game when it was at its worst. Let them have their privilege

[2023-01-04 15:01:55] <Mongobeef> 14 isn't main title, it is just a numbered title
[2023-01-04 15:01:55] <%+agentgerbil> i liked stranger of paradise
[2023-01-04 15:02:09] <%+kelkkun3> 14 is the FF title in 20 years though
[2023-01-04 15:02:13] <%+kelkkun3> the best*
[2023-01-04 15:02:16] <%S4nG0> i'm probably gonna get Stranger of Paradise at one point
[2023-01-04 15:02:17] <%Amylou14> @Lonefellow I get that but they also get the tattoo and Chocobo they could least let us have the CS
[2023-01-04 15:02:30] <!%yrvengalied> yea after 10 , FF series was fluctuating between really good and DAMN this suuuuucks
[2023-01-04 15:02:36] <%blakey95uk> I still get ff14 flashbacks of the 100 quests to complete to go any further
[2023-01-04 15:02:54] <%Selnica> admittedly, the mmos shouldn't be numbered titles
[2023-01-04 15:02:59] <+LevoGames> I really want tactics advance again, but NOT the psp one
[2023-01-04 15:03:22] <%MasterVGuides> I have a feeling we will see FFT Remastered announced this year.
[2023-01-04 15:03:29] <%spectr0nn> @Mongobeef there's always been spinoffs that werent top quality though. remember Erhgeiz for example?

[2023-01-04 15:04:43] <Mongobeef> of course an FF9 remake and an FF7 remake, FF8 continues to be the stepchild...
[2023-01-04 15:04:46] <!%yrvengalied> UE5 but with the same miniature models for characters
[2023-01-04 15:05:01] <%spectr0nn> yeah Forspoken is Luminous just like this game
[2023-01-04 15:05:09] <%+Toby_1_Kenobi> Isn't FF VII Rebirth on Unreal 5?
[2023-01-04 15:05:10] <%Amylou14> @Mongobeef I MEAN FF8 did get its remaster while FF9 has gotten nothing

[2023-01-04 15:05:37] <%CynniUniflame> what kind of game is Forespoken? Action rpg?
[2023-01-04 15:05:46] <%Selnica> please tell me it's an improved and updated version of luminous?
[2023-01-04 15:05:46] <%bromdr> No we have FF9 Remaster
[2023-01-04 15:05:57] <%spectr0nn> @CynniUniflame best on the demo, very much so yes
[2023-01-04 15:06:18] <%Amylou14> The steam version is a remaster? Today i learned!
[2023-01-04 15:06:21] <+LevoGames> ffta is what needs to be redone and updated with an infinite mode or something :(
[2023-01-04 15:06:48] <%CynniUniflame> thanks Spectr0n! Maybe something to buy on sale
[2023-01-04 15:07:09] <!%yrvengalied> @Toby_1_Kenobi it is and it is set to for Winter This Year sevenHype
[2023-01-04 15:07:11] <%spectr0nn> i did not like the forspoken demo at all, but ymmv
[2023-01-04 15:07:26] <%CynniUniflame> also: FF9 is just a port XD It's hardly a remaster

[2023-01-04 15:07:39] <!%yrvengalied> @spectr0nn same
[2023-01-04 15:07:50] <%MasterVGuides> The Forspoken demo grew on me the more I played it.
[2023-01-04 15:08:14] <Mongobeef> But...I want realistic looking Quina who just vores monsters
[2023-01-04 15:08:16] <%Selnica> what platforms is the forspoken demo on?
[2023-01-04 15:08:21] <%MasterVGuides> PS5
[2023-01-04 15:08:26] <%spectr0nn> PS5 and uhhh maybe pc?
[2023-01-04 15:08:45] <%Selnica> gotcha.
[2023-01-04 15:08:46] <AJReid93> PS5 (timed) exclusive I believe
[2023-01-04 15:08:50] <%spectr0nn> but yeah the game definitely has input lag issues
[2023-01-04 15:08:57] <%Selnica> I'll gave to try it
[2023-01-04 15:09:07] <AJReid93> Maybe I'm wrong...
[2023-01-04 15:09:31] <AJReid93> Forget I spoke - it's PC too :)

[2023-01-04 15:09:36] <!%yrvengalied> @MasterVGuides didnt like the combat it was floating and didnt have enough weight , also the stamina thing they had i hope they remove it as the free roaming while running was fun
[2023-01-04 15:09:56] <%spectr0nn> is the PS4 version of PoE running at 30 fps or no?
[2023-01-04 15:10:07] <%CynniUniflame> I can't get forespoken on pc. ours will never run it XD I think Luna might like it, but it's not a first day buy for me
[2023-01-04 15:10:19] <zcerolina> would like a ff11 remake/remaster to make it more accessible. ome of the few main titles I haven't played.
[2023-01-04 15:10:30] <!%yrvengalied> Forspoken comes out on PC the same day as PS5 if i remember correctly
[2023-01-04 15:10:37] <%GanD988> question what are the red "walls" that sometimes appears ?
[2023-01-04 15:10:40] <AJReid93> Forspoken was originally a two-year exclusive for PS5, then it was announced as PS5+PC
[2023-01-04 15:10:42] <%spectr0nn> the performance mode of Forspoken runs fine at 60 fps btw, but it still has too much input lag
[2023-01-04 15:10:52] <%Selnica> ff11 is a mmo. that's difficult to make a remake for
[2023-01-04 15:10:55] <%GanD988> oh ok xD
[2023-01-04 15:11:13] <!%yrvengalied> yea Forspoken comes out on PC Jan 24th same as PS
[2023-01-04 15:11:37] VIEWERS: 509
[2023-01-04 15:11:44] <%spectr0nn> the demo is probably based on an older build of the game btw, so there's a decent change things will have improved with the final release
[2023-01-04 15:11:58] <%+russybcool> how do they not hear the noise when noct warps. it's so quiet I would find it harder not to hear him
[2023-01-04 15:12:08] <!%yrvengalied> catJAM
[2023-01-04 15:12:52] <%CynniUniflame> I mean, it could be. We already had to send ours for repair cause the disk drive wouldn't eject games anymore. Got a new one instead cause they couldn't fix it

[2023-01-04 15:14:09] <zcerolina> was thinking a remake could take ff11 to the solo rpg realm. it has its trust system today which makes it more or less soloable.
[2023-01-04 15:14:13] <%Lonefellow> I mean, it's great that I don't need to turn on heating but it just feels fucking wrong

[2023-01-04 15:39:45] <%Amylou14> Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries' cuisines. It is made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet and, depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients.

[2023-01-04 16:47:26] <%XyFreak> @Lonefellow they...dont
[2023-01-04 16:47:40] <%Lonefellow> @XyFreak I assume those have a separate entrance

[2023-01-04 16:48:38] <%Lonefellow> And use anyone other than Noctis to make it easier
[2023-01-04 16:48:48] <%XyFreak> also sidequests
[2023-01-04 16:48:59] <%XyFreak> rest at inns to tripple your stored experience
[2023-01-04 16:49:13] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, some inns have a bigger EXP bonus than others
[2023-01-04 16:49:21] <%Lonefellow> So stockpiling EXP until you get to those is recommended
[2023-01-04 16:49:30] <%spectr0nn> i still remember being super sick while playing through this part of the game, so that is my main assocciation with it. having to go to the toilet a lot
[2023-01-04 16:49:33] <%venatoritas> cool thanks all
[2023-01-04 16:49:51] <%XyFreak> its also super worth it

[2023-01-04 16:51:03] <%Lonefellow> I mean, I'm someone that does a shitton of side content even in my first playthrough so I utilized those inns like a madman
[2023-01-04 16:51:16] <%Lonefellow> Even in early chapters
[2023-01-04 16:51:30] <%XyFreak> yeah i tried to use inns whenever possible
[2023-01-04 16:52:03] <%spectr0nn> i didnt realise this was sponsored, so i always found it kinda weird how much time they spend on this

[2023-01-04 17:08:57] <%venatoritas> if I remember correctly last year or before that, there was a break.
[2023-01-04 17:09:18] <%$IronMog> 6 years ago the first time BGG was in the fiesta
[2023-01-04 17:09:24] <%Sarkans41> last year, 3 or 4 years ago.. same thing
[2023-01-04 17:09:33] <%+yeroon> the moment you walked away from your car there, a car alarm IRL just outside my house went off
[2023-01-04 17:09:38] <%+yeroon> that was weird
[2023-01-04 17:09:49] <%CynniUniflame> and then they discovered that a break didn't do the fiesta any good

[2023-01-04 17:12:18] VIEWERS: 436
[2023-01-04 17:12:27] <%Lonefellow> Because reruns are no longer a thing Twitch feature wise
[2023-01-04 17:12:33] <%$IronMog> Too much of a pain to set up
[2023-01-04 17:12:38] <%Lonefellow> Seven is doing them as live broadcasts and BGG doesn't want to
[2023-01-04 17:12:46] <%Lonefellow> Short answer
[2023-01-04 17:12:50] <%+Vextarr> ah ok
[2023-01-04 17:13:11] <%CynniUniflame> BGG also doesn't have seperate PCs for streaming and gaming, so that would mean he can't use his pc
