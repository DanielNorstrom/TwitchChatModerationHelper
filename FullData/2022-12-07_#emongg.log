[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%+WellbeWelloff> "it's ramming time!"
[2022-12-07 17:34:18] <%faultysaeg> The only time I found ram's vortex annoying was when I got caught in it and Sojourn's death sphere
[2022-12-07 17:34:23] <+dasdardly> wait blizzar worl is back, game is good again!
[2022-12-07 17:34:24] <%faultysaeg> I practically froze
[2022-12-07 17:34:35] <%OwenChief> that is most definitely a pharah ult
[2022-12-07 17:34:36] <%OwenChief> :D
[2022-12-07 17:34:40] <!%$Naleri> I agree.
[2022-12-07 17:34:43] <hanibal2410> i will thing locking passives behind roles was a misstake
[2022-12-07 17:34:52] <hanibal2410> still
[2022-12-07 17:34:56] <%OwenChief> i love blizzard world, and im happy rialto is back as i love sym on that map
[2022-12-07 17:34:56] <%stud_muffin_23> If anything, like bi-weekly map pools
[2022-12-07 17:34:58] <+mayran01> playing against pharah mercy is so annoying..
[2022-12-07 17:34:59] <hanibal2410> think
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <+AlBroiser> Overcast is the same as real life climate?

[2022-12-07 17:35:07] <%OwenChief> i wish they took busan out of map pool tho, so tired of that map
[2022-12-07 17:35:09] <evangelbelmont> Especially in unranked. Map pools for ranked is more understandable.
[2022-12-07 17:35:12] <whitewolf991> i haven't won a single game today, I think there is something wrong in competitive, it's not balanced at all
[2022-12-07 17:35:14] <luazri> wait! are map pools also in qp? that doesn't make any sense
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <yeetodafeeto> Love the anti-air ability that doesnt work on flying heroes
[2022-12-07 17:35:17] <$Scoopzyy> Ramattras block should act like DVA's defense matrix, right now it's kinda underwhelming unless you're just trying to stall during ult
[2022-12-07 17:35:22] <%+WellbeWelloff> pro tip when blocking, spin really fast
[2022-12-07 17:35:25] <@%^StreamElements> We're looking to add more moderators for Twitch chat! Apply here if you're interested and have time to spare: https://forms.gle/nX2d6AN9VxKfw4PF6
[2022-12-07 17:35:52] <%$Filt_r> ok pog
[2022-12-07 17:35:52] <%faultysaeg> @hanibal2410 Honestly the big thing was they KNEW with single tank, tanks would need a universal passive to help and support would probably need one too. Then they just kind of had to find something for DPS to round it out.
[2022-12-07 17:36:00] <%Pkkspiral> @whitewolf991 Weirdly enough I was playing vs Top 500, Masters, and GM in QP this morning. Idk if I'm better than I thought, or there's something wrong KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:36:00] <%+supernod83> I don't mind the idea of a map pool, but the game doesn't have enough maps for it at present.
[2022-12-07 17:36:02] <JapaneseCultureExpert> KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:36:06] <+weebism_> What is happening

[2022-12-07 17:36:15] <TheBardFather> so broken
[2022-12-07 17:36:16] <+ZerahBallad> Lol that ending
[2022-12-07 17:36:23] <+Shady_Wolverine> ive been curious for the longest time, does quickplay/unranked use some kinda of skill based match making
[2022-12-07 17:36:24] <ShxdowChar> GG
[2022-12-07 17:36:24] <dj_eimis1> hi

[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <Grav__> fun interactive gameplay
[2022-12-07 17:36:34] <masatgt> @TheBardFather git gud
[2022-12-07 17:36:34] <Forsakei> Wow, that works in spawn? That;s stupid.
[2022-12-07 17:36:44] <flamboyant__1> Just like a 76, ignoring what’s right in front of them lol
[2022-12-07 17:36:48] <%OwenChief> @Shady_Wolverine yes it has secret MMR otherwise it would be a shit show (more than it currently is)
[2022-12-07 17:36:48] <Nandor> "good" LUL
[2022-12-07 17:36:49] <kamakaz07> is he unlocked in competitive???
[2022-12-07 17:36:50] <masatgt> @AtomicFerris 45 levels of battle pass or 10 bucks
[2022-12-07 17:36:54] <BionicBunV1> Ramattra a lil average, but his ultimate CLAPS
[2022-12-07 17:37:01] <VaporeonWave> @AtomicFerris on the batter pass he's free when you hit lvl 45 but other then that u gotta buy him
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <%faultysaeg> @Shady_Wolverine Yes, but it's not as stringent as ranked at all and you'll find yourself in weird lobbies in QP, especially if people are stacked with wildly different match making ranks
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <%OwenChief> @kamakaz07 not for 2 weeks, same as all other hereos
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <+ayylien__> @kamakaz07 no
[2022-12-07 17:37:10] <hanibal2410> @faultysaeg i would prefer if they use hero passives instead role passives and have way more of them and you pick what u want
[2022-12-07 17:37:10] <+MalicLandrea> So I don’t know how true it is, but they originally said the map pool was to give them a chance to update out of rotation maps.
[2022-12-07 17:37:14] <%+WellbeWelloff> that's a good Ram bingo slot: x second long ult
[2022-12-07 17:37:15] <Ouroborosdude> and who would of known I lost all my stuff thanks blizzard cus I just wasted money on this damn gamr
[2022-12-07 17:37:18] <kamakaz07> thanks
[2022-12-07 17:37:21] <%madkiller92> KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:37:22] <VaporeonWave> the battle pass not batter lol
[2022-12-07 17:37:22] <%+PreeminenceWon> so is Ramattra meta now?
[2022-12-07 17:37:30] <bird_bebop> Just played my first quickmatch with Ram and he’s pretty op I’m ngl lol
[2022-12-07 17:37:40] <masatgt> @PreeminenceWon he is bad af lmao
[2022-12-07 17:37:40] <+cartetris3> man
[2022-12-07 17:37:45] <%$bananaboydean> @MalicLandrea based on how blizzard world looks now It seems true enough
[2022-12-07 17:37:46] <+ayylien__> @bird_bebop sick bait
[2022-12-07 17:37:48] <+Shady_Wolverine> ok, i thought i was a little crazy
[2022-12-07 17:38:02] <+cartetris3> how you got goold, the season started yesterday
[2022-12-07 17:38:06] <scarletinne> @bird_bebop Nice troll LUL
[2022-12-07 17:38:09] <+cartetris3> gold*
[2022-12-07 17:38:12] <bird_bebop> Only downside to popping off in panic form is he doesn’t have much range and can’t throw down his normal shield but I just went 13-0 it went by so quick
[2022-12-07 17:38:16] <Lebby710> Doom got buffed crazy screw the doom meta
[2022-12-07 17:38:18] <booplesnoot6151984> @bird_bebop really? because everyone is saying Ramattra is underpowered
[2022-12-07 17:38:23] <+oswin_gk> Do you use scroll wheel and/or space to jump?
[2022-12-07 17:38:23] <cptnaces> Do you think theyll change Ramattras block?
[2022-12-07 17:38:24] <+Shady_Wolverine> @PreeminenceWon he is fun though

[2022-12-07 17:40:26] <AtomicFerris> Shout needs to be back to beta in order for that to happen
[2022-12-07 17:40:28] <OwenChief> ball can still get value but needs a team to understand how to play around him
[2022-12-07 17:40:30] <%$statictristan> didnt they buff her healing tho

[2022-12-07 17:46:11] <hanibal2410> if Kiriko knifes was hit scan and she heal throe suzu , like long duration heal over time and no talismans she would be fine
[2022-12-07 17:46:13] <quaz823> @TheFazBur I don't think so, she was originally marketed as genji the support basically, I think the extra kunai helps, also have you seen what moira can output compared to kiriko?

[2022-12-07 17:48:16] <hanibal2410> what if kiriko can put up to 2 talismans on 2 allies and heal thou hitting kunai, so headshots heal 3x but kunai is hit scan now CoolStoryBob

[2022-12-07 18:10:16] <%+bulbasaur12269> @HalfDrowShaman the punching only lasts 8 seconds and the range isn't as good as it looks honestly.  if rein shields you won't kill him yourself with the punching and then you're dead in the water.  Sig can play a lot further away, rocks charge, and has a much easier time shielding slam with the insta cast
