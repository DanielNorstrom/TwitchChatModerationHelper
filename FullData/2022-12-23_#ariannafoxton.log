[2022-12-23 00:54:56] <%Xan09> it could be the same root meaning as lieutenant though, meaning "in lieu of who's in charge we have these person to be the tenant"

[2022-12-23 01:00:59] <%ThumbBro> Considering I was using a 30 dollar Walmart mic, anything would be an improvement
[2022-12-23 01:01:03] <%Bribe_Guntails> Headset mics are definitely inferior in audio quality

[2022-12-23 01:02:09] <%Bribe_Guntails> However you can lean into the shiddy mic quality, go into your mic settings and set the sample rate to like 8,000 Hz for that military-grade radio effect
[2022-12-23 01:02:10] <!%OniKanaVT> like gaming headsets tend to be overpriced as well
[2022-12-23 01:02:55] <%+UrsidaeCrow> gaming headsets are definitely square 1 as far as audio goes
[2022-12-23 01:03:18] <!%OniKanaVT> yeah getting a decent psir of headphones and a cheap mic is so much better

[2022-12-23 01:03:44] <%+UrsidaeCrow> just get a decent pair of headphones and a standing mic and you're set until something breaks
[2022-12-23 01:04:05] <%Xan09> set output to the headset but input to your laptops built in and thank me later

[2022-12-23 20:44:25] <Zelinth_Twitch> I might be wrong but I think war thunder has radar returns from rivers modeled, so it’s harder to lock from@above if you’re over water
[2022-12-23 20:44:25] <Chukase> Do not need another T-80
[2022-12-23 20:44:29] <Chukase> already got 3....

[2022-12-23 20:44:37] <Zelinth_Twitch> As compared to ground
[2022-12-23 20:44:54] <Chukase> @Zelinth_Twitch environment plays a huge role in WT radar, yea.

[2022-12-23 20:45:33] <Zelinth_Twitch> @chukase radar must be bugged as anything
[2022-12-23 20:45:35] <Chukase> You basically need to be above 2k for it to work properly, and then you are easy picking for more modern jets.
[2022-12-23 20:45:39] <Zelinth_Twitch> It’s hard to model
[2022-12-23 20:45:59] <Chukase> As far as I can tell radars work as intended.
[2022-12-23 20:46:04] <@%Wloos> Sadge
[2022-12-23 20:46:05] <Zelinth_Twitch> Oh
[2022-12-23 20:46:13] <Zelinth_Twitch> I thought they would be bugged
[2022-12-23 20:46:16] <Chukase> F-4E had bad radar because it was downsized to fit the gun in the fuselage
[2022-12-23 20:46:19] <@%Wloos> wtf is everyone giga gaming
[2022-12-23 20:46:21] <Chukase> F-4J has much better radar

[2022-12-23 21:17:22] <Zelinth_Twitch> A nautical mile is 1/60 of a degree. So it helps in calculations for something called “Dead reckoning”
[2022-12-23 21:17:36] <Zelinth_Twitch> Like one degree of latitude or long.
[2022-12-23 21:17:59] <$pjsforshort> isn't nautical knots?
[2022-12-23 21:18:05] <Zelinth_Twitch> Yes
[2022-12-23 21:18:13] <Zelinth_Twitch> Nautical miles per hours is “knots”
[2022-12-23 21:18:19] <mario_boz> what is up woth the airplane names?
[2022-12-23 21:18:24] <Zelinth_Twitch> So 60knots is a degree per hour.

[2022-12-23 21:22:11] <@%+Cruuvo> Ari my concept of a missile is a tube with a big thruster at the back and fins. I don't actually know how they maneuver in space tho like do they use ailerons or small adjustment thrusters or what?

[2022-12-23 21:28:17] <Zelinth_Twitch> That way when it comes to aviation, until I joined the industry I didn’t realize how many precise things are needed and how many misunderstandings are there.
[2022-12-23 21:28:57] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> the X15 pilots actually had to beg NASA to not add an air-breathing engine for reentry based on their experience

[2022-12-23 22:01:19] <%$SpartiniisMrNimbus> Boing lost it's lead due to poor decision making and the 787-9 crashing

[2022-12-23 22:01:22] <Zelinth_Twitch> Why so?
[2022-12-23 22:01:38] <%$SpartiniisMrNimbus> Airbus made a -lot- of military helicopters

[2022-12-23 22:02:38] <Zelinth_Twitch> What about the A350 1000?
[2022-12-23 22:02:51] <%$SpartiniisMrNimbus> A380 is getting outphased already

[2022-12-23 22:08:18] <Zelinth_Twitch> @spartiniismrnimbus yeah that too
[2022-12-23 22:08:24] <Zelinth_Twitch> The 787 was super rushed
[2022-12-23 22:08:32] <%$SpartiniisMrNimbus> I think that was the downfall of Boing
[2022-12-23 22:08:36] <Zelinth_Twitch> And then hiding the MCAS system that’s so sad
[2022-12-23 22:08:47] <%$SpartiniisMrNimbus> Remind me, what's MCAS?
[2022-12-23 22:08:51] <Zelinth_Twitch> Because the MCAS is something that Airbus already had in another form
[2022-12-23 22:09:07] <+Kaiser_Fluffywuffy> I can tell you right now that the B-17 is gorgeous. There's one based at an airfield about a half hour away, so i occasionally see it fly over my house. That thing is gorgeous.

[2022-12-23 22:59:26] <Order_of_Dusk> So while Germany may not be turning off all of their reactors immediately, I do hate the fear mongering around nuclear power that probably led to those reactors being decommissioned, like we're already on a time limit with Climate Change, we don't need to make things harder for ourselves by rejecting an entire energy source that is much cleaner than fossil fuels

[2022-12-23 23:01:38] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> also, while nuclear waste generation is relatively low, we're still talking about several thousand tons per year.
[2022-12-23 23:01:40] <%Bribe_Guntails> I guess a reactor that processes waste has been considered already?

[2022-12-23 23:04:06] <Order_of_Dusk> So basically the jist of it is that Germany was really shit at managing a nuclear power program and that's why they're replacing some nuclear reactors with fossil fuels

[2022-12-23 23:36:41] <Symfynx> War thunder better than WoT?
[2022-12-23 23:37:41] <%LossyInput> it's like comparing the COD and battlefield franchises
[2022-12-23 23:37:46] VIEWERS: 237
[2022-12-23 23:37:52] <+FoLyK_> very basic damage models
[2022-12-23 23:37:54] <+FoLyK_> in wot
[2022-12-23 23:37:58] <+Vajomancer> Sounds like personal preference but the simulated tank models in WT are nice
[2022-12-23 23:38:01] <+MrPro_Noob> I hate the RNG of WoT
[2022-12-23 23:38:13] <+MrPro_Noob> WoWS is somehow worse
[2022-12-23 23:38:15] <+FoLyK_> a lot of RNG in WoT as well
[2022-12-23 23:38:22] <%LossyInput> surface-level similarities but very different if you actually know anything about them
[2022-12-23 23:38:24] <Hubi1996> no CAS? sounds like heaven
[2022-12-23 23:38:39] <+Vajomancer> Lol right?
[2022-12-23 23:38:45] <+FoLyK_> war thunder has artillery which is annoying af
[2022-12-23 23:38:45] <Enzo_brits> Hello
[2022-12-23 23:38:50] <+FoLyK_> sorry WoT***
[2022-12-23 23:38:57] <Order_of_Dusk> World of Tanks also doesn't have the defining feature of War Thunder: The Russian Bias

[2022-12-23 23:39:11] <!+Omnicrash> MERRY CHRISTMAS ARI & CHAT
[2022-12-23 23:39:15] <%+Swufy> Do tanks pop into view in War Thunder like they do in WoT?
[2022-12-23 23:39:15] <%LossyInput> musicmommyWow santa?
[2022-12-23 23:39:19] <Symfynx> Im so over snow already
[2022-12-23 23:39:22] <+MrPro_Noob> artillary can be somewhat fought and countered by moving cover etc, but cas? unless you spawn spaa first, a lot of the time there is no counter
