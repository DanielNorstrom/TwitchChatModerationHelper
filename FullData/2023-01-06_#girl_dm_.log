[2023-01-06 19:47:46] <%Quiet_Ben> TBF, your hand can be broken by a massive variety of seemingly small impacts. Like, as an example: If you (for whatever reason) want to bite off someones fingers, the actual force is apparently on par with biting off a carrot. So yeah, human bodies are simultaneously much more and much less fragile than you might think.

[2023-01-06 20:11:20] <%Jerzeem> @Prophet970 and plantains?
[2023-01-06 20:11:39] <C0UnterSapiens> bananas are usually harvested as seeds and grow on the way oversees in the crates
[2023-01-06 20:11:47] <jetstreamlove_R> Green banana are better, letting them naturally rippened taste better
[2023-01-06 20:11:52] <roguedruidwords> frozen ingredients are almost always equitable to fresh, though you do suffer somewhat in texture. freezing veg for long shelf life can make them slightly rubbery. just account for that in cooking time.
