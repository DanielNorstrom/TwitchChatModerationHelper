[2023-01-10 00:01:08] <kodoku71> @marsu_marsu I think rogue and mage should never have access to healing no matter what because that ends up just being abused in combo decks to help them survive against aggro, an example of it is DH's way of healing

[2023-01-10 00:02:06] <kodoku71> skill is playing without hands and winning
[2023-01-10 00:02:08] <%nerazzurri_> or he has double brand
[2023-01-10 00:02:12] <chokenurris> 4/4 and 3/5 alone would have been insanely good board on turn 5 in vanilla

[2023-01-10 00:39:58] <smilingsaint> @Zaxlor now that i have ps plus extra subscription i often dont buy games because i expect they will be free on service in a year
[2023-01-10 00:39:58] <bunnyhoppor> I've been trying to think and the best examples are like holidays
[2023-01-10 00:40:23] <Zaxlor> @smilingsaint Yeh I've stopped buying a ton of PS4 games because they end up "free" on PS+

[2023-01-10 00:41:48] <bunnyhoppor> ah yh that's true I spend 2k on a gaming PC, when 1.2 would have prob done it
[2023-01-10 00:41:57] <azreal3356> were they for the sexcult

[2023-01-10 00:42:01] <smilingsaint> the point where the card had an actual watermark was pretty amazing

[2023-01-10 00:45:49] <%+Jymbo26> This is gonna be nuts
[2023-01-10 00:46:08] <+datfrogger> @ioreign1 nah rogue at the top is better than most any other class at the top
[2023-01-10 00:46:13] <+datfrogger> especially priest
[2023-01-10 00:47:01] <ioreign1> @datfrogger but draka rogue was worse to play against than naga priest 9 times out of 10
[2023-01-10 00:47:03] <i_wraith_x> @ioreign1 it doesn’t feel good to me when any one class is really dominating.  Even my preferred class.  I like to face a variety of opponents and pilot a variety of decks.
[2023-01-10 00:47:04] <%+Xeath5> you didnt wanna kill the taunt?
[2023-01-10 00:47:11] <clamshs> why rogue ?

[2023-01-10 00:47:58] <nachowelas> should’ve killed taunt tho
[2023-01-10 00:48:00] <%+Antonbrehbrahbruh> winning with the coin is a flex
[2023-01-10 00:48:17] <%+Xeath5> this man was talking for about 30 mins why he doesnt like to spend lots of money and chat suprised he saved the coin ICANT
[2023-01-10 00:48:19] <smilingsaint> saving the coin is like saving special items for a boss fight in rpg.  then not using them anyways at the boss, in case after you beat the boss an even bigger boss comes out

[2023-01-10 01:16:01] <+xCruznik> volume was good
[2023-01-10 01:16:10] <azreal3356> if they reverted most of the quest changes and other nerfs for standard card do you think the meta would open up or would rogue still be too fast

[2023-01-10 01:18:20] <azreal3356> also they nailed the rogue theme beautifully because when you play against rogue it actually feels like your opponent is cheting

[2023-01-10 01:19:36] <%snaktray> wouldn't it have been better to pelagos with that
[2023-01-10 01:19:39] <liezito> It was too good, then they nerfed OTK quest and it rotated

[2023-01-10 01:49:05] <EloGiggIe> do not craft astalor
[2023-01-10 01:49:25] <kantdestroyer1> Astalor low risk
[2023-01-10 01:49:31] <dalitzking> astalor is safe
[2023-01-10 01:49:35] <%breakfast_boi21> Do craft Astalor. It either stays good or you get the dust back.
[2023-01-10 01:49:41] <%+earl_of_darkness> @breakfast_boi21 that was the whole point... it costs 5 instead of 3 XD
[2023-01-10 01:49:47] <Yaya_> Pure Paladin maybe safe? Good deck that nobody is playing so it might be strong next patch cycle

[2023-01-10 01:49:56] <Zaxlor> To me, the phrase "safe craft" means that it WILL get nerfed and it's "safe to craft" because you'll get your dust back KEKW

[2023-01-10 01:51:06] <mingjianchen3> Especially maestra gnoll should be nerfed (blizzard pls)
[2023-01-10 01:51:09] <%breakfast_boi21> Yeah Maestra might get bad but not get nerfed if they nuke rogue

[2023-01-10 01:51:22] <%+Xeath5> a card that is getting nerfed is safe to craft as you get the dust bet... but you dont get the other useless cards back for the deck you craft that is no longer good
[2023-01-10 01:51:24] <VikingJackAU> @zaxlor often it's one card that gets nerfed, maybe a rare that kills a deck you crafted 2 legendary and 4 epics for KEKW

[2023-01-10 03:00:52] <%snaktray> fact, if gay is bannable that is becuase mods are treating "gay" as a slur
[2023-01-10 03:00:55] <%+ucdchris1> if this is controll warrior does control paladin seemed super favored?

[2023-01-10 04:44:59] <%+slighthaze> ok, so turn 10... about twice what it is now... for that to be possible all cards get there stats cut in half
[2023-01-10 04:45:19] <%+slighthaze> that doesn't seem probable
[2023-01-10 04:45:20] <%+Darkthunder119> I expect potion belt to be borderline deleted lol
[2023-01-10 04:45:21] <%+SnowMyzer> Did someone play brawl for 5 mana in chat? “Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!”
[2023-01-10 04:45:47] <randomer22> turn 10 is hard to achieve because you have to nuke rogue and also hit shockspitter again at a minimum
[2023-01-10 04:45:53] <%+Xeath5> that cariel is 8 mana and we have 7 mana? Kappa
[2023-01-10 04:46:01] <randomer22> but their goal is probably not for most games to go 10 turns
[2023-01-10 04:46:44] <%+Xeath5> the avg turn time is 7 or 8 atm dont remember

[2023-01-10 04:47:28] <%+Xeath5> but also avg turn time doesnt mean anything when only like top 1k play rogue and dh "for real"
[2023-01-10 04:47:33] <%+Darkthunder119> It's okay to get high rolled and lose
[2023-01-10 04:47:41] <%+Darkthunder119> but not every game needs to reliably end at turn 5
[2023-01-10 04:48:23] <%+SnowMyzer> Omg this song played out of a radio in a house on the black ops 1 map “Havana”
[2023-01-10 04:48:30] <grimBleeper> YEP if you look at the vs report for top 1k legend and just put your hand over miracle rogue then the game's perfectly balanced

[2023-01-10 05:29:35] <%+Darkthunder119> when he said hes top 20, he meant in Apprentice ranks. hes Wood 20.
[2023-01-10 05:29:38] <umjev> anachronos bugs it
[2023-01-10 05:29:44] <grimBleeper> @IcyMcSp1cy Kappa i'm rank 10 too, just on a ladder that is in a different school
[2023-01-10 05:29:53] <umjev> the real taunt was the friends we made along the way
[2023-01-10 05:29:58] <%+Xeath5> also he could have just looked up my rank EZ

[2023-01-10 05:31:52] <grimBleeper> @Ieafes i mean, we've barely seen any miracle rogues so maybe this guy is 5Head
[2023-01-10 05:31:59] <%+slighthaze> 8 mana... they knew what they were doing
[2023-01-10 05:31:59] <%+Darkthunder119> 30 card druid isnt too bad. Nohands played it for a bit too
