[2022-12-22 15:12:24] <+strok3r83> You get loss forgiveness bc you lost a teammate
[2022-12-22 15:12:25] <%prynders> Never had it work that way for me before
[2022-12-22 15:12:26] <+b00m07> no< you started with 3
[2022-12-22 15:12:26] <%smitty0078> if someone leaves the game then you don't lose rp I think
[2022-12-22 15:12:26] <davidsgettinracks> U don’t
[2022-12-22 15:12:28] <mooooseyy> if you queue in with two people you get loss forgiveness
[2022-12-22 15:12:28] <richo1233> if s9meone quits you  an quit
[2022-12-22 15:12:28] <apolovigilant> yes u do bro

[2022-12-22 15:12:32] <mooooseyy> but they changed it
[2022-12-22 15:12:32] <+SammySmokeS_> Only if you have a dc
[2022-12-22 15:12:33] <+PressYourDuck> Yes in theory
[2022-12-22 15:12:33] <뭉치555 (abc58633)> keep going dude
[2022-12-22 15:12:33] <%LauraMoora> You will now because there's less than half of the lobby left
[2022-12-22 15:12:34] <%ThisPrincess_> Wait what
[2022-12-22 15:12:34] <richo1233> yes
[2022-12-22 15:12:34] <%DtSkyy> he abandoned, and yes you could do that
[2022-12-22 15:12:34] <mrfen1> didn't think you did if they leave in game
[2022-12-22 15:12:34] <$thank_ufor_subscribing> yes
[2022-12-22 15:12:36] <vicdamonjrsr> Yeah
[2022-12-22 15:12:36] <Djkrick_> technically yes
[2022-12-22 15:12:36] <Cortibby> He left before he fied
[2022-12-22 15:12:37] <%Lem0nyBaby> if they leave it stays at 0
[2022-12-22 15:12:38] <%smitty0078> HMMMMMMM
[2022-12-22 15:12:38] <dbButlerdb> @HisWattson in theory yes
[2022-12-22 15:12:38] <YashaYZ> yes u can
[2022-12-22 15:12:39] <+TheSludacris> Yea, but they would get -200 and not be pred
[2022-12-22 15:12:39] <Cortibby> Died*
[2022-12-22 15:12:39] <%+leafwrassler> yeah I think so
[2022-12-22 15:12:41] <%$blisseree> @turtleTiff HEYY turtle488Heart
[2022-12-22 15:12:42] <%smitty0078> AYYO
[2022-12-22 15:12:44] <mixedaf> its only within certain mins or something
[2022-12-22 15:12:45] <%smitty0078> NEW STRAT
[2022-12-22 15:12:50] <%+Gape_Burrito> They get abandon penalties tho
[2022-12-22 15:12:52] <+crazefitt> it was op when there was no demotion
[2022-12-22 15:12:52] <@%$turtleTiff> hi bliss turtle488Ribbit
[2022-12-22 15:12:52] <auzura_> theres a time limit to it
[2022-12-22 15:12:58] <+SammySmokeS_> That’s a theoretical theory
[2022-12-22 15:12:59] <$thank_ufor_subscribing> you would need a new teammate every 10 minutes though LUL
[2022-12-22 15:12:59] <skywalkert55> In theory yes he would get minus rp and a 10 min penalty
[2022-12-22 15:13:00] <+strok3r83> If you back out you will lose rp but if you stay at the end you won’t
[2022-12-22 15:13:02] <%+icebeast32> it only works so many times I think
[2022-12-22 15:13:02] <dalgona696> thats what they do
[2022-12-22 15:13:07] <%+icebeast32> in a day
[2022-12-22 15:13:08] <Cortibby> If they take a penalty yes you won’t lose tp
[2022-12-22 15:13:08] <Strad08> You will still loose rp, just don’t have a penalty
[2022-12-22 15:13:09] <+Jester4B> your teammate would lose RP everytime though
[2022-12-22 15:13:12] <%DtSkyy> @HisWattson you could do that yes, but whoeevr does that for you will lose double RP, so eventually you wont be able to do continue doing it
[2022-12-22 15:13:17] <%+scurrdogg> Honeydew is a goat
[2022-12-22 15:13:19] <%+hisalmighty> There’s a ten minute  wait penalty for leaving
[2022-12-22 15:13:23] <dbButlerdb> @HisWattson im sure there is also some bug or cheat or glitch whatever where you que up duo but it wont allow you to fill team so in theory you get free games without rp punishment
[2022-12-22 15:13:24] <%+W1nn_D1esel> That teammate would get banned quick
[2022-12-22 15:13:25] <doublesigil> you denied 1 point on algs to dropped once

[2022-12-22 15:28:12] <%DtSkyy> Cheer100 A guy came up to me the other day and asked “Who would be a good politician?” Well it didn’t take me long to think of an answer. I swiftly told him, “I know a guy called HisWattson who would probably be the best politician in the world. I don’t know if he cares about politics much but he sure loves tellin’ fuckin lies’ to his team mates about being rezzable and shit, and I think that’s pretty much what politicians do too.

[2022-12-22 16:32:14] <r1steady> @bloodbonesandglory then that isn't really a good start. If console already is like gold / silver cap for you. I would see go practice in the range a lot and 1v1 with friends that helped me alot

[2022-12-22 17:09:57] <%+AgingPixel> Fortunately, unlike the original Overwatch, players no longer need to reach level 25 to partake in Competitive mode. Instead, players can, in theory, unlock Competitive mode in Overwatch 2 by winning 50 Quick Play matches - only Role Queue and Open Queue will count.

[2022-12-22 18:11:00] <@%^Nightbot> Honestly, nobody puts in as much work as TSM, they train for hours, and Hal's even working on controller so he can be even better at this game. Verhulst is literally beaming kids with his eyes closed with how much time he's put in on apex. The addition of Reps and Raven to their team just proves that they have a winning mindset and are focused on the grind. With all of this hard work and effort, they can easily secure a top 15 spot in the next ALGS, #TSMWIN

[2022-12-22 19:22:53] <%l33rerkarton1> Can 1 raisin hurt a dog? Can a Single Grape Kill a Dog? Unfortunately, even consuming one grape or raisin can be fatal. Ingesting the fruit could potentially lead to acute (sudden) kidney failure in dogs.

[2022-12-22 19:23:40] <%l33rerkarton1> How many raisins does it take to hurt a dog? Grapes and Raisins Toxic dose: The dose that can cause serious problems is 0.7 ounces per kilogram of grapes and 0.1 ounce per kilogram of raisins. This means that 3 grapes (or 3 raisins) could be fatal for a 2.5 pound puppy, and 12 grapes (or 12 to 15 raisins) could potentially kill a 10-pound animal.

[2022-12-22 21:28:56] <+yami_yaki> you get fined and you can possibly get evicted you from your own house
[2022-12-22 21:28:56] <+reapingmike> it only takes one karen on an hoa to ruin your life
[2022-12-22 21:28:56] <+realPurpleWood> You’re paying for the land ur property is on.
[2022-12-22 21:28:57] <+SoftPandaCubz> Some good some bad.. current HOA is good. If you say no they can put a lien on your house/ condo
[2022-12-22 21:28:58] <%idkjaney> they can take you to court roo
[2022-12-22 21:28:58] <parksabrad> cause house go brrrrrrrrr
[2022-12-22 21:29:00] <%AustinWeirdo> B/c people like their neighborhoods to look "nice"
[2022-12-22 21:29:00] <+iamCooper0> they are everywhere
[2022-12-22 21:29:00] <+MotherSupreme> because not all HOAs suck
[2022-12-22 21:29:01] <+therealbestgamer> hoas take care of lots of things to keep the houses in the area pretty nice
[2022-12-22 21:29:03] <tp2ply> most nice neighborhoods have HOA
[2022-12-22 21:29:03] <+Bonesaga> Legal actions that can result in very high fines
[2022-12-22 21:29:04] <DEKEHOUSE> well some HOAs are super picky and petty. Some are less. Just depends
[2022-12-22 21:29:04] <+riogoose> There are fees/requirements for mowing/snow if applicable/lawn length/noise/where your cars are parked/what you have in your yard/or anything else they've decided.
[2022-12-22 21:29:04] <+Warmfreezer> you cant be robbed legally
[2022-12-22 21:29:04] <gasmeup274> My HOA provides a pool a basketball court tennis courts they maintain the subdivision and they clear the roads
[2022-12-22 21:29:06] <Glocktoxic> if the HOA doesnt have strict rules its not bad
[2022-12-22 21:29:06] <+imixedbloodi> Sum ppl like em
[2022-12-22 21:29:06] <zachb1313> They have benefits
[2022-12-22 21:29:07] <+W00KIEE9577> they have some benefits but generally are run poorly
[2022-12-22 21:29:07] <wagner262> keeps neighbors from leaving their yard and house like shit
[2022-12-22 21:29:09] <%+kizer346> yea and they can put a lien on your house if you dont pay...
[2022-12-22 21:29:09] <turrrdin> take ammos u gonna regret it
[2022-12-22 21:29:10] <+ima_survivor> could mow your lawn, shovel etc.
[2022-12-22 21:29:10] <@%^Nightbot> Maybe
[2022-12-22 21:29:10] <+batgang402> my HOA sucks
[2022-12-22 21:29:11] <OddVenturer> anyone who complains about HOA is a bystander in their own life lmfao
[2022-12-22 21:29:11] <sauceboss16> lmao "they take the first born"
[2022-12-22 21:29:11] <Stompound> Because you can trust other homeowners in the area to abide by the same rules
[2022-12-22 21:29:12] <TheVelveteenCat> Because if you don't have an HOA, your neighbors can be slobs, not worry about their yards, noise, cars, ect...and drives the value down
[2022-12-22 21:29:13] <epikkritical> the original owner of the house can choose to be in iit
[2022-12-22 21:29:15] <%mikemitchh> upkeep on houses is better
[2022-12-22 21:29:15] <Glocktoxic> just some have wack rules and annoying neighbors
[2022-12-22 21:29:15] <capncone> I lived in an area once where the how organized trash pickup/snow plowing, stuff like that. but in general they seem bad
[2022-12-22 21:29:16] <+theGooeyduck> HOA makes it so you can't park your cars in your front yard and paint your house bright puke orange
[2022-12-22 21:29:17] <+zebmmm> Sometimes they protect the community, stop neighbors from starting a crackhouse lol
[2022-12-22 21:29:17] <mikeabra> @HisWattson they take care of shit sometimes like neighborhood issues or landscaping
[2022-12-22 21:29:21] <sjaypka1> U have to cut the grass when they say
[2022-12-22 21:29:22] <MustacheLincoln> They don't even live there, I live in Austin TX and my HOA is based in Las Vegas
[2022-12-22 21:29:23] <+TheButton_Pusher> so it doesnt look like a trailer with a 4x4 with no tires in the driveway @HisWattson
[2022-12-22 21:29:24] <+Sev0h> some HOAs have good amenities, park, pool, lawn care. others are a scam
[2022-12-22 21:29:24] <%The3lackYoshi> if you don't join they stream snipe you
[2022-12-22 21:29:24] <+therealbestgamer> its how they take care of the community you live in
[2022-12-22 21:29:24] <Usolando> HOAX NODDERS
[2022-12-22 21:29:24] <Xclusive28> Cause a lot of HOAs can be good in it forces people to keep things nice
[2022-12-22 21:29:25] <WhiskeeBear> They serve a purpose - keep neighborhood looking uniform, basically just hold everybody to a standard so you know what you're getting into. Pick up your shit, follow the rules, everybody is fine. And they maintain common areas.

[2022-12-22 21:29:28] <+reapingmike> @gasmeup274 YOU provide that with fees and taxes
[2022-12-22 21:29:30] <colinsarmy> It keeps the neighbors from painting house pink and trailer in parking lot
[2022-12-22 21:29:31] <yoshi4mayor> No horizon? :/ sad face
[2022-12-22 21:29:32] <%AustinWeirdo> Depends on what you value, freedom vs mandated uniformity
[2022-12-22 21:29:32] <+fennerface> If you have a neighborhood pool or some other amenity they often manage that
[2022-12-22 21:29:33] <+DimeHitta> They can actually kick you out of the house and sell it for Pennys on the dollar (usually to themselves) if you don’t follow their HOA rules.  Happened to my best friend
[2022-12-22 21:29:36] <+batgang402> they fucked our financial reserves and now they want to double our HOA
[2022-12-22 21:29:38] <gasmeup274> They maintain the common areas not your yard lol
[2022-12-22 21:29:39] <+Mattyklein> It’s like a shit housing union
[2022-12-22 21:29:40] <+dopdahl> how can be good to maintain property value and build public areas like parks and shit
[2022-12-22 21:29:44] <+gen10pilot> Its no different than our civil property law. "We the people vote for it" by proxy.  Its a microcosm of the same situation
[2022-12-22 21:29:45] <+yami_yaki> A family once owned a home under HOA and refused to do anything to their home from the HOA and they were eventually evicted from the home that they paid off.
[2022-12-22 21:29:46] <+mulatterad0> My HOA just went up 40 bucks again this next year 😭
[2022-12-22 21:29:47] <+imixedbloodi> Safe  neighborhood usually gated nice area
[2022-12-22 21:29:49] <+sixtysevenss> I own a condo and pay monthly HOA fees. It covers things like lighting, gardening, etc. I do not have to do anything to the outside of my property. So only worry about internal issues.
[2022-12-22 21:30:00] <erfdsw> have you tried winning a game at this rank without a shield on you?
[2022-12-22 21:30:02] <+zachthacka> most of better neighborhoods have them and its pricey to live not close to others
[2022-12-22 21:30:03] <%toiletsmuggler> we got some fuckin HOA geniuses in here
[2022-12-22 21:30:08] <OddVenturer> they take fees and have cake parties with your money toooooo lmfao HOA suburban mafia
[2022-12-22 21:30:10] <+mulatterad0> They are nice tho bc I don’t wanna do the trash, maintain landscape, water bills, all exterior stuff
[2022-12-22 21:30:13] <+KittieFPS> @thevelveteencat so move somewhere where you don’t have to worry about neighbors if you are so uptight about everyone else’s house.

[2022-12-22 21:30:43] <%AustinWeirdo> I don't care if my neighbor's property looks like shit or if they have 3 buses. I don't like anyone telling me what to do with my house.
[2022-12-22 21:30:49] <+reapingmike> its up to you tho I specifically didnt wanna live in an HOA

[2022-12-22 21:30:56] <TheVelveteenCat> @KittieFPS I did, I have an HOA, there are parts of this city that don't. I personally like quiet and clean, maintence, no loud kids, no junk in drive ways, but its all personal preference

[2022-12-22 21:32:13] <+xProning> @yokai_potempkin a little bit more than holstered actually
[2022-12-22 21:32:13] <+yami_yaki> Homeowners associations were first created in the mid-19th century, but didn't gain popularity until the 1960s. Their popularity was driven by a rapid growth in suburban development and a desire by white Americans to keep certain populations out of their neighborhoods, experts say.
[2022-12-22 21:32:13] <%Focdem> I wouldve fallen for that

[2022-12-22 21:32:26] <%AustinWeirdo> @AustinWeirdo If the neighborhood looks like crap, don't move in. But most people want their property to looks as good as they can afford. I always look at non-HOA property.
[2022-12-22 21:32:31] <+DimeHitta> My best friend in Scottsdale got charged  feee secretly for months without notice and then got a letter of eviction by the HOA and his $750k house sold to one of the HOA directors for $300k

[2022-12-22 22:05:58] <%Focdem> @parksabrad Try shooting where the enemy is moving, instead of where the enemy is at that moment. Adjust your aim to sync up with your delay. Still, close range kinda hard.
