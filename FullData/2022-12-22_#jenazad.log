[2022-12-22 05:29:31] <+eman12399> i don't think counter works because you can just leave him alone
[2022-12-22 05:29:42] <+limbomber> is he the first person to give effectiveness buff to his team
[2022-12-22 05:29:42] <+eman12399> you have a million turns to kill him

[2022-12-22 05:39:06] <Beanflakes> does his venom det scale off anything
[2022-12-22 05:39:08] <%F3scorn> do Illynav stonks go up with DDR injury inversion Copium
[2022-12-22 05:39:30] <eljackoloco> so to be clear again Jena, Belian is better pick here before ml ray unless youre pvp intensive player right?
[2022-12-22 05:39:45] <akiandblue> Are you gonna pull him jena?
[2022-12-22 05:39:49] <Beanflakes> solitaria kinda just fucks him doesnt she
[2022-12-22 05:39:53] <lonelymanjohnnyking> like she inflicts venom with her s1 bc of ml ray meaning she auto resets cd by 1 turn?
[2022-12-22 05:39:53] <%+SamBZ> Ilynav is that piece :)
[2022-12-22 05:39:58] <%ML_Zahhak> its gonna be dumb hes gonna suck and theyre gonna buff him to be op after his banner goes away

[2022-12-22 05:40:02] <Xamess> bruh ml ray sounds good since he gives that buff that puts venom to all the team,and with all the injury units running nowadays he is gonna shine ok
[2022-12-22 05:40:04] <eljackoloco> hope i can get vildred too
[2022-12-22 05:40:05] <%Z1nsmiter> he holds a poison vial to belian

[2022-12-22 06:38:29] <lonelymanjohnnyking> Handguy was so bad
[2022-12-22 06:38:30] <%+ApePecs> Elena does a little damage before she dies in a ditch
[2022-12-22 06:38:30] <sStarMech> aywin was meta tho for a while
[2022-12-22 06:38:30] <%+TristenWulf> nocap
[2022-12-22 06:38:33] <rev0007> handguy release is dogwater
[2022-12-22 06:38:33] <Beanflakes> release atywin still kinda worked
[2022-12-22 06:38:38] <kaiii56> djb was
[2022-12-22 06:38:43] <%+ApePecs> Ray and Kawerik do nothing
[2022-12-22 06:38:46] <HaleE7> probably a.tywin, i remember him being pretty bad LUL
[2022-12-22 06:38:50] <%ML_Zahhak> You guys realize ML Ray is gonna get buffed right, SG doesnt leave units weak anymore except ML Celine

[2022-12-22 06:38:55] <nguyenhungtan> what about early Arby LUL
[2022-12-22 06:38:56] <lonelymanjohnnyking> Atywin was bad but he was useful in certain drafts
[2022-12-22 06:38:57] <smithalgenie> elena does nothing too tho
[2022-12-22 06:38:59] <shurekkukami1> arby was so ass
[2022-12-22 06:39:05] <%+mojosef> ray 775 base def tho, clearly viable
[2022-12-22 06:39:07] <%+ApePecs> Release Arby was truly terrible but maybe release Stene was worse
[2022-12-22 06:39:16] <zuyruna> HandGuy
[2022-12-22 06:39:20] <%+Its_Lyken> early aravi?

[2022-12-22 06:39:44] <keemocheedesu> didnt reduce debuff by 1 turn
[2022-12-22 06:39:46] <%Lucysbrother> he doesnt have the 1 turn debuff reduction when its up

[2022-12-22 06:40:09] <%+KuroTheChronos> it was so bad before the buff
[2022-12-22 06:40:37] <%+ApePecs> 6 in one half dozen in the other I suppose
[2022-12-22 06:40:39] <zuyruna> ok
[2022-12-22 06:40:46] <%+KuroTheChronos> he did his job. I liked using him but yeah he was underwhelming
[2022-12-22 06:40:51] <%+KuroTheChronos> but at least he did his job

[2022-12-22 06:41:07] <%Lucysbrother> ml elenas awakening tree was the most confusing
[2022-12-22 06:41:08] <+ZonbiZonbiZonbi> servers are up?
[2022-12-22 06:41:12] <%+ApePecs> The other thing to keep in mind was that at the time of Kawerik release Atywin was still a monster and Kawerik was still unusable
[2022-12-22 06:41:14] <+MisterTwinkle> yea but her design is so good though
[2022-12-22 06:41:17] <%+KuroTheChronos> elena didn't do her job
[2022-12-22 06:41:18] <+ZonbiZonbiZonbi> the hell?

[2022-12-22 06:41:50] <%+ApePecs> All good, they buff the bad ones. Like they'll buff Ray
[2022-12-22 06:41:51] <%Monika_AYAYA> lvl 50

[2022-12-22 06:42:09] <%+ApePecs> The most hilarious thing is that Ray is bad against Soli
[2022-12-22 06:42:14] <%Lucysbrother> tama dont need to be 60 to beat all the content in game
[2022-12-22 06:42:14] <%+ApePecs> Because he's a focus character
[2022-12-22 06:42:28] <+Viperfalcon> you'd think they would want to release strong characters so more people buy in for them
[2022-12-22 06:42:28] <kono_jio> RAGEY 60 her NOW
[2022-12-22 06:42:32] <ThirteenLantern> doesnt ml ray still beat tank down teams?
[2022-12-22 06:42:32] <+ZonbiZonbiZonbi> Ray needs the focus for S3 otherwise there would be no injury for his gimmick
[2022-12-22 06:42:40] <%itsvulop> why tf would they release him as poop and then buff him after his banner ends tho? havent thye learned anything from asslena?
[2022-12-22 06:42:45] <%+KuroTheChronos> what does venom do again?
[2022-12-22 06:42:45] <%+mojosef> i thought he seemed mediocre BEFORE i realized he had focus, hes that bad
[2022-12-22 06:42:45] <herminator_g> Soli and Ray is a lot of injury though
[2022-12-22 06:42:47] <BeeConsumer500k> ray bad against the main stall character and he's only good in slow games, truly incredible
[2022-12-22 06:42:53] <+Wilbell_Armure_cpuchi> He stands there, menacingly
[2022-12-22 06:43:02] <%keny_1994> i only hope they buff him when he's still on his banner KEKW
[2022-12-22 06:43:03] <complx7> @Viperfalcon they have been playing it safe ever since the outrage earlier this year with the seven disasters
[2022-12-22 06:43:04] <+Juggernaut999> ray is a guy character you have to wait longer for buff
[2022-12-22 06:43:09] <%+KuroTheChronos> is there like any other venom characters out yet?
[2022-12-22 06:43:10] <mag_solaegis> This shit audio quality is getting out of control. Why have English dub at this point?
[2022-12-22 06:43:10] <rev0007> don't you think buffing ml5 after they are no longer at the banner is kinda bad for people who don't pull said ml5 (because they suck)?
[2022-12-22 06:43:19] <%+ApePecs> AND and and and and you can't even use him in PvE like Sharun because Venom is PvP only
[2022-12-22 06:43:20] <Xamess> @KuroTheChronos sharun ok
[2022-12-22 06:43:21] <+ZonbiZonbiZonbi> ae-KARINA is gonna OP forget RayRay
[2022-12-22 06:43:31] <mateothapotato> he looks like someone you could see in DemonSlayer . so thats the compliment
[2022-12-22 06:43:42] <Venaticy> can i see your laika?
[2022-12-22 06:43:42] <+WhileIEatToast> Coping a little, but maybe DRay just has a very specific niche?

[2022-12-22 06:56:20] <+Viperfalcon> why don't they just change venom to poison, and make their effects work on uniits that are poisoned?
[2022-12-22 06:56:28] <fae_2001> DRAY OP, HE IS SHARUN ENABLER JUST WAIT FOR CHAOS
[2022-12-22 06:56:31] <+Viperfalcon> venom is basically a decoration that appears above your head and nothing else

[2022-12-22 06:57:28] <nyxxlul> summoners war giana?
[2022-12-22 06:57:31] <eth3rious> they wanted to make sharun kinda relevant so they dont need to buff her

[2022-12-22 06:58:06] <ExisNev> buf inversion would have been cool
[2022-12-22 06:58:07] <%+ApePecs> Has counterplay, strong effect
[2022-12-22 06:58:25] <%Monika_AYAYA> inverse healing should be a thing
[2022-12-22 06:58:26] <Cloakin7> they should just rename venom to cum
[2022-12-22 06:58:28] <danise36> tons of thing to counter him: immunity, cleanse, Ed, Soli, zerato, stun
[2022-12-22 06:58:30] <Cloakin7> people would pull for that
[2022-12-22 06:58:33] <bickdig32> fr

[2022-12-22 06:59:09] <$brandieplays> Chat is weird tonight Concerned
[2022-12-22 06:59:12] <Beanflakes> they should give him explosive venom ok
[2022-12-22 06:59:13] <ie_g> also his s3 being focus makes it more worst coz he needs to ramp up aswell xD
[2022-12-22 06:59:23] <%LightOctobeRain> ml theatre ok
[2022-12-22 06:59:25] <%+pomatotomtato> I was actually thinking it will be so fun if he reverse all buffs, like def up to def break
[2022-12-22 06:59:28] <%Exia423> that is why I thought he would revive people thru extinction
[2022-12-22 06:59:33] <%+ApePecs> Maybe a sick Zombify revive where the revived units have some special effect
[2022-12-22 06:59:36] <%ML_Zahhak> once we get more venom chars and injury chars Rey will shine hes a late bloomer trust ok
[2022-12-22 06:59:40] <fae_2001> ZAMN IMAGINE BRINGING ZOMBIE ALLIES, MUST BE COOL

[2022-12-22 07:23:45] <%TheGameplayHub> !yulha
[2022-12-22 07:23:45] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-22 08:22:57] <%+J_y_c_y> It's probably because it's not a video format and just the data of the fight emulated by the game
[2022-12-22 08:23:02] <kingsprodigyx> @Jenazad you saw the christmas skin for Veroncia already?

[2022-12-22 08:23:06] <LeocoyP> ?
[2022-12-22 08:23:12] <Nuxii__> extra damage against buff characters
[2022-12-22 08:23:15] <NubcakePie> The ability to cheese lab with perma invul
[2022-12-22 08:23:17] <FuwafuwaYui> she was my main pve unit
[2022-12-22 08:23:22] <+yuikooo> needs a silence for her s3 but she has no silence
[2022-12-22 08:23:25] <assertor1290> it is same as Ervalen complainers
[2022-12-22 08:23:32] <Shirousa> her s2 silences
[2022-12-22 08:23:35] <nyxxlul> she has a silence
[2022-12-22 08:23:43] <armlore> it is the same 2 people
[2022-12-22 08:23:44] <NubcakePie> She can CR push herself out of immunity now
[2022-12-22 08:23:45] <%boomerangmonkey99> watch the new labyrinth ignore er and strips so yufine cant cheese anymore
[2022-12-22 08:23:55] <NubcakePie> *immortality
[2022-12-22 08:23:59] <strazecloser> lab cheese you  literally turn off all yufine skills , what is the difference?
[2022-12-22 08:24:01] <meowmutu_> bosses are immune to silence
[2022-12-22 08:24:03] <kingsprodigyx> probably not, people just love to complain

[2022-12-22 08:24:35] <+shaolex> do people really use Yufine that much for PvE
[2022-12-22 08:24:39] <nyxxlul> where else is she used

[2022-12-22 08:24:53] <lolxd111127> @shaolex maybe to cheese normal lab in one run
[2022-12-22 08:24:56] <%+Christophideus> I like Yufine in light expo
[2022-12-22 08:24:57] <FuwafuwaYui> @nyxxlul expos

[2022-12-22 08:25:08] <FuwafuwaYui> yes
[2022-12-22 08:25:10] <WildBerserk> yea but S3 dispels all buffs
[2022-12-22 08:25:13] <aimless_wonderer> I did Sadge
[2022-12-22 08:25:16] <%boomerangmonkey99> this is like the ervalen change
[2022-12-22 08:25:26] <nyxxlul> does the expo buff count as a buff
[2022-12-22 08:25:28] <+yuikooo> s3 dispel + stun
[2022-12-22 08:25:52] <$yamaarashi287> i like it
[2022-12-22 08:25:55] <kingsprodigyx> when are we getting ML yufine btw
[2022-12-22 08:25:55] <Xamess> Concerned
[2022-12-22 08:25:59] <meowmutu_> i use her strip on AI KEKW
[2022-12-22 08:26:03] <eggsu> just play lab like a normal pleb =.=
[2022-12-22 08:26:05] <lolxd111127> maybe those guys are twitter cops
[2022-12-22 08:26:05] <eggsu> VoHiYo
[2022-12-22 08:26:11] <WildBerserk> i meant for pvp would be good to dispel and stun
[2022-12-22 08:26:27] VIEWERS: 1 136
[2022-12-22 08:26:29] <%boomerangmonkey99> i think we're missing the ml ken buffs
[2022-12-22 08:26:34] <nyxxlul> i mean why dispel and stun when you can dispel and kill ok
[2022-12-22 08:26:36] <%TheGameplayHub> yea I don't get the people that say she's useless for yufine lab
[2022-12-22 08:26:41] <FuwafuwaYui> she was just very versatile with a fun niche
[2022-12-22 08:26:43] <HighImShadow> All 3 yufine users malding rn KEKW
[2022-12-22 08:26:43] <%TheGameplayHub> I understand the light expo guys tho
[2022-12-22 08:26:48] <+Viperfalcon> if you got asked to be on the balance team, would you do it?
[2022-12-22 08:27:09] <%TheGameplayHub> but but the molas BLUBBERS
[2022-12-22 08:27:09] <%+Christophideus> I like Yufine so any excuse to use her i'll take
[2022-12-22 08:27:18] <nyxxlul> ok remove light expo from the game
[2022-12-22 08:27:22] <NubcakePie> Ilynav in shambles atm
[2022-12-22 08:27:30] <strazecloser> light expo you just use SC carmainerose.... dont need yufine , ice expo use Giselle dont need yufine
[2022-12-22 08:27:33] <WildBerserk> still better balance team than riot
[2022-12-22 08:27:33] <meowmutu_> ilynav NOOOO
[2022-12-22 08:27:38] <%boomerangmonkey99> there are definitely some units where the balance team fucked up
[2022-12-22 08:27:39] <Shirousa> honestly all they have to do is remove the seal from light expo and the problem is solved
[2022-12-22 08:27:44] <afroking1124> ilynav been ass since release
[2022-12-22 08:27:59] <FuwafuwaYui> needing silences to stick is rough though

[2022-12-22 08:28:53] <lolxd111127> @afroking1124 Astromancer elena needs the buff to disable counterattacks but Belian just needs to exist to block souls.....yep seems balanced
[2022-12-22 08:28:53] <meowmutu_> i like her thighs yumyum
[2022-12-22 08:28:54] <vooji_> @Jenazad okay but buffing her after her banner is gone is kind of a D move
[2022-12-22 08:28:54] <%TooCoolforaName> wish I pulled elena but she didn't wanna come home
[2022-12-22 08:29:01] <%Romdeau> I was mildly inconvenienced, ml 5 selector now Fishinge

[2022-12-22 08:29:27] <evandariel> @gusn69 instead of a no counter debuff its an undispellable buff on herself that block counter
[2022-12-22 08:29:28] <evandariel> basically
[2022-12-22 08:29:29] <sum1Kind> ray will probably get the same treatment

[2022-12-22 08:30:02] <%boomerangmonkey99> they fucked up so hard on the ml kawerik buff they reran his banner twice but his wasnt even the worst case cause it took around 6 months for his buffs

[2022-12-22 14:29:58] <%AuKi39> the downside of doing that is the gold

[2022-12-22 14:30:19] <TalesTyrone> @Reckless666 from testing her arti does about 1.09x of current Def stat (after buffs), so it's probably better to just go speed def or counter def

[2022-12-22 14:30:33] <%SariGabes> @Reckless666 cuz people will max imprint just to have 100% chance and it's "free" extra dmg based on a stat that you are using
[2022-12-22 14:30:36] <%dinomisax> this may sound stupid but is karinas arti the best on her?
[2022-12-22 14:30:47] <%Remotoz> are you making a new video for your impressions on the new unit mr streamer?

[2022-12-22 14:31:10] <TalesTyrone> @dinomisax Good on any unit that builds Def that has a single target attack - dmg is roughly 1.09x of the units defence (after buffs etc)
