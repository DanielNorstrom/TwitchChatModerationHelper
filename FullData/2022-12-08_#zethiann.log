[2022-12-08 00:56:26] <+YoRHaKurumi> we're like mid for eva classes
[2022-12-08 00:56:57] <!%+chaosronin333> People also forget we are a pure melee class too. We need some amount of tankiness
[2022-12-08 00:57:05] <%+Skisce> you think 309 912 acc drak will hit hard?
[2022-12-08 00:57:06] <!%+chaosronin333> Or we die before getting close to an enemy
[2022-12-08 00:57:37] <+chocolateblaze> ill give it a try. i just want something that is a bit more braindead than awak nin. it feels like everyone else just has full SA rotations with protected cc's and its frustrating
[2022-12-08 00:57:39] VIEWERS: 484
[2022-12-08 00:58:12] <esdeathsjaeger> They also overly protected with lot of cc  as well
[2022-12-08 00:58:21] <!%+chaosronin333> Also, Gauntlets... We are just way cooler than any of the other classes

[2022-12-08 15:54:29] <%Lekrashan> way easier to get through hunting, up by ash forest
[2022-12-08 15:54:37] <@%Valkeaa> if you have a hunter LUL
[2022-12-08 15:54:40] <@JUNIORSAURUS> @in_ver why do u make money in real life kinda dumb question
[2022-12-08 15:54:54] <%Lekrashan> you will be happier hunting
[2022-12-08 15:54:55] <@JUNIORSAURUS> the answer is to show off
[2022-12-08 15:54:57] <@%Valkeaa> you don't
[2022-12-08 15:55:02] <@%Valkeaa> you cna just kill griffons and skin them
[2022-12-08 15:55:11] <%MazeMS> ehh I think when I did a rotation of 1 server of Navarn Steppe I got like 40 griffon claw in 6-7min ish
[2022-12-08 15:55:15] <@%Valkeaa> hunting is faster
[2022-12-08 15:55:15] <@JUNIORSAURUS> tanning
[2022-12-08 15:55:17] <%Lekrashan> I once tanned griffons for 2 hours, 0 claws. Take 2 minutes hunting and get 30
[2022-12-08 15:55:20] <@JUNIORSAURUS> hunting is nto fater
[2022-12-08 15:55:23] <@JUNIORSAURUS> stop teh cap
[2022-12-08 15:55:27] <@JUNIORSAURUS> gl finding a griffon
[2022-12-08 15:55:28] <%MazeMS> I think it should be like 6 claw = 5 party elixir ish
[2022-12-08 15:55:29] <@JUNIORSAURUS> idiots
[2022-12-08 15:55:44] <%Lekrashan> you want to hunt
[2022-12-08 15:55:47] <AbyssalJuggernaut> Man i gotta start hunting
[2022-12-08 15:55:49] <@JUNIORSAURUS> griffon spawns 1 time per channel
[2022-12-08 15:55:54] <@JUNIORSAURUS> and u have to channel hop
[2022-12-08 15:55:57] <%Lekrashan> there is literally one on his channel right now
[2022-12-08 15:56:01] <%Lekrashan> press M then look at ash forest

[2022-12-08 15:56:19] <%MazeMS> are we helpful yet? :)
[2022-12-08 15:56:21] <%Lekrashan> There is a griffon on your channel right now
[2022-12-08 15:56:27] <%Lekrashan> at ash forest
[2022-12-08 15:56:29] <%Lekrashan> batman symbol
[2022-12-08 15:56:33] <@JUNIORSAURUS> the batman icon
[2022-12-08 15:56:40] <@%Valkeaa> so I don't know which is faster, whatever, all I can say is I killed griffons for about 45 minutes got 54 claws, made 62 party elixiers with master 15 alc
[2022-12-08 15:56:46] <@JUNIORSAURUS> yes that thing
[2022-12-08 15:57:04] <%Lekrashan> just check your home servers +1, you can usually find 2-4 griffons
[2022-12-08 15:57:04] <@%Valkeaa> I killed them in navarne step
[2022-12-08 15:57:04] <@JUNIORSAURUS> normal killing is faster
[2022-12-08 15:57:09] <@JUNIORSAURUS> cause u have to be fed channels
[2022-12-08 15:57:13] <@JUNIORSAURUS> for hunting griffon
[2022-12-08 15:57:14] <@%Valkeaa> I used magic knife

[2022-12-08 15:57:48] <@JUNIORSAURUS> just gather them
[2022-12-08 15:58:00] <@%Valkeaa> just kill them in navarrne and gather
[2022-12-08 15:58:00] <%Lekrashan> The way i do it, do a kama truffle rotation, check the server for a griffon

[2022-12-08 16:02:45] <retribution26> well. it just doesnt need a price increase. a slight price increase but a 50% increase per hour to the drop rate of the claws would be better. the only people that do that are the ones that want to or solely use them for themselves. tanning just isnt good money due to the base mats

[2022-12-08 18:08:03] <%orphic_lightstylez_> I would honestly tag a Shai if the artina went with it. Always played healer or support in all my other MMO's.
[2022-12-08 18:08:11] <%orphic_lightstylez_> I do enjoy playing one honestly.
[2022-12-08 18:08:14] <@%+Kinjara> I dont think you need to tag it since the artina doesnt copy
[2022-12-08 18:08:19] <@%+Kinjara> just make the artina then get blackstars for it
