[2022-12-22 18:29:18] <%+UnzipsRS> gate 4 is easy
[2022-12-22 18:29:24] <%+UnzipsRS> gate 5 is cringe
[2022-12-22 18:29:26] <%+UnzipsRS> of all gates
[2022-12-22 18:29:36] <%+UnzipsRS> no i mean
[2022-12-22 18:29:38] <%+UnzipsRS> gate 5 in general
[2022-12-22 18:29:40] <%+UnzipsRS> the mechs
[2022-12-22 18:29:42] <+TinoHS> I didn't play since w3 vykas, restarted a few days ago. It's tough now I get gatekeeped so much..
[2022-12-22 18:29:52] <%+UnzipsRS> even g6 was easier for me than g5
[2022-12-22 18:30:06] <%+UnzipsRS> because the problem with g5 is u need every1 to be alive
[2022-12-22 18:30:28] <+TinoHS> Vykas NM and HM f.e.
[2022-12-22 18:30:36] <+TinoHS> vyk nm seems to be 1445+ now
[2022-12-22 18:30:48] <+FireZky> holy stoopz only speaking facts on video
[2022-12-22 18:30:51] <+FireZky> i total agree with him
[2022-12-22 18:31:05] VIEWERS: 341
[2022-12-22 18:31:33] <+FireZky> Do you really they gonna do anything about that stuff tho ?
[2022-12-22 18:31:48] <+FireZky> Im not so sure about that
[2022-12-22 18:31:56] <+FireZky> Like they gonna do anything
[2022-12-22 18:32:05] <%+UnzipsRS> but like lets be real they could have released the new classes for KR and also the west at the same time but again we're getting sloppy seconds and KR gets to theorycraft and everything and we're left to just follow their meta..
[2022-12-22 18:33:06] VIEWERS: 341
[2022-12-22 18:33:08] <+FireZky> Ppl is too focused about content or new classes. How about return player and new players ?So u have actual players who play with you
[2022-12-22 18:33:45] <+FireZky> Its not fix but definetly helps
[2022-12-22 18:33:56] <+FireZky> But not me LUL
[2022-12-22 18:33:56] <JaxeEnGames> yeah the artist delay is a stinker indeed. :(
[2022-12-22 18:34:03] <+FireZky> i think i gonna get artist around 1460ilvl
[2022-12-22 18:34:39] <%+GHOSTEDonline> not to mention a 4 month dry spell of no content or classes, there will be no players left
[2022-12-22 18:34:51] <%+UnzipsRS> dont u need 1580 for all gates of brel hard
[2022-12-22 18:35:07] VIEWERS: 378
[2022-12-22 18:35:20] <JaxeEnGames> oh there will be some who are determine or wait it out with another game
[2022-12-22 18:35:52] <Sasquoth> Smilegate is big on making stupid decisions. Unless its a big money maker if people drop a lot of money to push new class towards new raid.
[2022-12-22 18:35:58] <+FireZky> How u would fix about get more players to play each other ?
[2022-12-22 18:36:05] <+FireZky> i think that is bigger issue then that
[2022-12-22 18:36:28] <+FireZky> Not go like "buy bus" or get gatekeep from content
[2022-12-22 18:36:34] <+FireZky> What definetly make players leave game
[2022-12-22 18:36:54] <JaxeEnGames> well that 48v48 isnt it

[2022-12-22 18:40:04] <Sasquoth> In my opinion artist should have been released when clown was out. Many people concider quitting at this point if they can't do brelshaza with support shortage.
[2022-12-22 18:40:16] <+Krystaliq> Yo, how u feeling so far about Brel? and HM in April sucks man
[2022-12-22 18:40:19] <+FireZky> u have good point tho
[2022-12-22 18:41:03] <+FireZky> But i think they should make some kind system someone experience players would teach others how to do x raid etc
[2022-12-22 18:41:08] VIEWERS: 411
[2022-12-22 18:41:33] <+FireZky> But i really doubt that they gonna do it
[2022-12-22 18:41:46] <+FireZky> but game healthy wise it would be really good idea like you said
[2022-12-22 18:41:57] <+FireZky> image if u get 1-2 players like more game
[2022-12-22 18:42:02] <+FireZky> its always win win
[2022-12-22 18:42:39] <+FireZky> company wins and community wins with that
[2022-12-22 18:42:51] <+FireZky> yeah sadly i don't think either
[2022-12-22 18:42:56] <+FireZky> they gonna do it

[2022-12-22 18:51:59] <Sasquoth> Imagine there was an alternative to do raids with your whole guild. 16 people Brel. 8 people could die. There is less pressure. Everyone who survived and performed well would gain better rewards. There would be less pressure on people and game would be more enjoyable.
[2022-12-22 18:52:06] <%Grizzlybooey> well you need to get to 1520 for brel, you can't do that with no gear lol
[2022-12-22 18:52:30] <%Grizzlybooey> they have done 16, and it doesn't really work well

[2022-12-22 19:01:55] <@%+strengthie> Problem is I think in NA a lot of money goes to 3rd party
[2022-12-22 19:02:02] <@%+strengthie> maybe EU as well
[2022-12-22 19:02:08] <Sasquoth> Judging from prices and worse gatekeeping, NA West is the worst.
