[2023-01-09 02:40:21] <@^Fossabot> @Lumiinos1ty It was discovered on a space mission that a frog can throw up. The frog throws up its stomach first, so the stomach is dangling out of its mouth. Then the frog uses its forearms to dig out all of the stomach`s contents and then swallows the stomach back down.

[2023-01-09 17:25:56] <%smashbunny16> moon2FAT Anyways uhm... I bought a whole bunch of McDonalds, Big Macs, do you know what McDonalds is? Anybody know what McDonalds is? No, not Old MacDonald, I think he's a farmer. Talking McDonalds. Anyways, it's a 2 beef patty burger that has a middle, third bun, that also clogs your arteries. So that's my story. I bought a whole bunch of the stuff, put it in the la fridga. Little snacks. Stuff like that.

[2023-01-09 17:26:25] <%FeedMyPets> Hello, it came to my attention that I was banned, despite my full intention to actively join the chat. And, I would like to extend my apology to amend my mistake. I will, and I will use all of my mental capabilities to reduce the number of repetitive words and emotes into minimum, 3 repetitions perhaps. In all honesty, I have learned my mistake. And, I would like to think that I can be given the 2nd chance. Thank you.
