You can then exchange those points to get Overwatch coins for free. There was an article I was reading about how it's faster to earn OW coins by doing Microsoft rewards then playing to game

[2023-01-07 22:48:02] <Althamus> DPS Mercy makes sense if you can see and capitalise on something others can't. If you're DPS Mercying more than healing/boosting then it's not so good.
[2023-01-07 22:48:13] <@%Grimstab77> I mean, ppl should chill on aggressive comments and hate just because someone misplayed in your game x)

[2023-01-07 23:06:46] <!Pepetchi> Why Echo though?:o
[2023-01-07 23:06:47] <dva_main_here> reapers shift ability is so annoying i played tracer in a game mode and he just went away from my ult
[2023-01-07 23:06:59] <%Danysovy1> now playing quick?
[2023-01-07 23:07:08] <assassin1518109> because it instantly transforms u into whoever u were looking at and at that moment it was orisa not reaper
[2023-01-07 23:07:18] <@%Grimstab77> @Pepetchi that's her new dps main she wants to learn
[2023-01-07 23:07:35] <!Pepetchi> Yea, I was just curious as to why Echo
[2023-01-07 23:07:35] VIEWERS: 339
[2023-01-07 23:07:48] <!Pepetchi> Echo's onthe hard side tbh
[2023-01-07 23:08:22] <!Pepetchi> McCree is the easiest dps in the game
[2023-01-07 23:08:28] <!Pepetchi> I don't think there's anything easier

[2023-01-07 23:11:03] <@%Grimstab77> it's ok that game was kinda unlucky. The enemy team was coordinated
[2023-01-07 23:11:03] <!Pepetchi> You need some knolwledge on a lot of hero's mechanics, very good positioning since Echo's hitbox is large af

[2023-01-07 23:12:17] <Althamus> The only downside with Echo is when she ults and you need to be able to play whoever you turn into as well =[

[2023-01-07 23:37:23] <+Raz_Bora> I think that's always a good idea. being flexible playing other roles helps one better understand positioning imo as one becomes more well rounded

[2023-01-07 23:56:54] <@%Grimstab77> Well Bulgarian accent sounds like eastern Europe countries. A bit similar to Russian but less sharp. German accent is very particular. However, Nali' sounds smoother than German and different than Russian/wester Europe languages
