[2022-12-12 00:12:46] <%a_moonlighter> same
[2022-12-12 00:12:47] <%ManiaFreak> i usually do hyper to test out

[2022-12-12 00:12:50] <@%SpikeLuk> NODDERS i play normals first, then ranked in NA then ranked in BR LOL
[2022-12-12 00:12:51] <sydvalo> i just go straight into ranked LOL
[2022-12-12 00:12:59] <%XrypticPyro> Viego is the current top AP comp if you wanna give it a shot
[2022-12-12 00:13:01] <%dtkflex> I'm just a gambler and will often start with ranked even if I get rolled a bit
[2022-12-12 00:13:05] <@%mrkmattos> i had 4 wins in a row yesterday
[2022-12-12 00:13:09] <supernovamd1204> Except right now everyone is bad so I either just force laser corps or mecha Jax and have been climbing
[2022-12-12 00:13:15] <@%mrkmattos> into 2 8ths and 2 6ths today
[2022-12-12 00:13:15] <@%SpikeLuk> mrkmattos heCrazy
[2022-12-12 00:13:17] <@%mrkmattos> so it balances out

[2022-12-12 00:15:11] <%juno338> it is favorable if it is a 3 or 4 cost
[2022-12-12 00:15:15] <@%SpikeLuk> ive been watching the tft tourney and its like zed or viego wins 90% of lobbies lol
[2022-12-12 00:15:17] <%XrypticPyro> @juno338 But then it feels like playing an augment down PepeHands

[2022-12-12 00:16:28] <supernovamd1204> Anima squad is such a bait… don’t do it lol
[2022-12-12 00:16:44] <%+tingon183> no downside you win and you heist you lose and you heist
[2022-12-12 00:16:50] <supernovamd1204> It never works period lol

[2022-12-12 00:17:36] <%AhngelLIVE> Renegades is a nice comp tho thats all i know
[2022-12-12 00:17:37] <@%mrkmattos> only if you have ashe 3 star
[2022-12-12 00:17:40] <%juno338> but she got kind of nerfed because he ult doesn't pass through units like it used to in set 3
[2022-12-12 00:18:03] <%+tingon183> @mrkmattos even then it's better with supers
[2022-12-12 00:18:09] <@%mrkmattos> having 2 star ashe or renekton in a 6 laser comp isn't worth
[2022-12-12 00:18:10] <Alampourzala> lost Madge
[2022-12-12 00:19:10] <%+tingon183> yeah
[2022-12-12 00:19:12] <@%mrkmattos> yes and it's very popular

[2022-12-12 03:58:03] <+Raiol_Varakin> it rarely makes sense for extra crit damage but that's an edge case

[2022-12-12 04:18:45] <Deamatrix> okay.
[2022-12-12 04:18:53] <%Lyzard> I think she can be used to give aphelios sureshot
[2022-12-12 04:19:07] <@%SpikeLuk> i think there is a senna reroll comp that keeps her? not sure
[2022-12-12 04:19:08] <+Raiol_Varakin> even if you stack items on sivir you usually sell her for a 1* and transfer items later
[2022-12-12 04:19:13] <%Lyzard> get two 2 stars and then sell the items for aphelios and put the other in for sureshot
[2022-12-12 04:19:17] <%Hayasaki42069> or u can go 4 sureshot 3 civilian lategame

[2022-12-12 05:24:16] <%chaewonfan> ref ruined the match
[2022-12-12 05:24:17] <%chaewonfan> tbh
[2022-12-12 05:24:18] <%+MeijiDoom> but she lost the chess
[2022-12-12 05:24:19] <%S3rp3nt_007> the ref did a 3rd count
[2022-12-12 05:24:20] <%Waibop> controversial whether or not 3 counts in a round

[2022-12-12 05:27:31] <Deamatrix> underground usually u get a big cash out and then get rid of most of the underground units

[2022-12-12 05:27:47] <%SomberAsh7> the number at the bottom right is when u get the opportunity for a loot reward
[2022-12-12 05:27:51] <@%SpikeLuk> losses give more heist point thingies
[2022-12-12 05:27:55] <%silverminnow> Wait is Underground the new Abe trait?

[2022-12-12 07:24:31] <ErrorCode404> Syndra is better yes
[2022-12-12 07:24:39] <DNeverTilt> mascot is good if you have lots of hp but otherwise no
[2022-12-12 07:24:45] <%SEAsianDegen> but @raliu31 the last week is bug fixes so thats means the last week is similar to release which makes testing for good comps easier.
[2022-12-12 07:24:45] <ErrorCode404> you get the HP with the units she throws in

[2022-12-12 07:25:15] <%raliu31> SEAsianDegen I mean every patch was pretty much bug fixes / updates, not just teh last week

[2022-12-12 07:26:24] <+HousekiPhos> I think units > synergies at this point
[2022-12-12 07:26:32] <%SEAsianDegen> @raliu31 i remember in previous sets the last week before release there will be huge updates so that’s a slight difference in this set.

[2022-12-12 07:37:57] <+HousekiPhos> mage comps are pretty easy this set

[2022-12-12 07:38:25] <nubcakee> @SpikeLuk just hit or get hit out of luck PepeLaugh
[2022-12-12 07:38:26] <+trixar> same i prefer ap every set
[2022-12-12 07:38:27] <@%SpikeLuk> i always play ad comps only but samira looks so boring this set i might play ap elisDank
[2022-12-12 07:38:27] <+HousekiPhos> into either god admin raka blue buff, taliyah shojin, or mf shojin
[2022-12-12 07:38:31] <%wamukara> Tali is positioning dependent. Good positioning counters her hard
[2022-12-12 07:38:37] <%+Just_A_Tad> I love ap comps as well
[2022-12-12 07:38:39] <BookDux> @starsmitten viego is the best Ap comp atm
[2022-12-12 07:38:47] <louis_lane> Have you seen the double velkoz ap comp? I'm in love with it right now
[2022-12-12 07:38:48] <nubcakee> @SpikeLuk only ad comp you should play zed or flex ap
[2022-12-12 07:38:49] <+trixar> but it always feels like they keep nerfing ap

[2022-12-12 07:39:00] <nubcakee> all ad items are nerfed to poop
[2022-12-12 07:39:05] <nubcakee> even jax is a ap scalining

[2022-12-12 07:39:11] <+Mikazukix1> @SpikeLuk Samira is ridiculously bad as a carry imo. Her damage is so unreliable.
[2022-12-12 07:39:15] <+HousekiPhos> yeah cause ad items giving flat ad was busted
[2022-12-12 07:39:15] <%+Just_A_Tad> Viego, Velkoz+threats, MF, Taliyah, and Soraka are all decent ap carries this set
[2022-12-12 07:39:17] <%venomenal829> I love sustain comps like a bunch of healing/dmg to stall until guinsoos or archangels scale
[2022-12-12 07:39:19] <@%SpikeLuk> nubcakee its not even about whats strong or balanced, its just that samira is looks so boring elisDank

[2022-12-12 07:39:38] <%wamukara> @mikazukix1 she needs Sureshot but slots are limited so its hard to fit in
[2022-12-12 07:39:39] <TheYellowSnorlax> my favorite ap carry is soraka or taliyah
[2022-12-12 07:39:57] <chadsxd> hi Celine! are you in the boxbox challenge?
[2022-12-12 07:39:58] <@%SpikeLuk> Baseg
[2022-12-12 07:40:07] <@%SpikeLuk> soraka looks so fun Baseg
[2022-12-12 07:40:08] <+HousekiPhos> I got soraka 3 with recon emblem in pre season
[2022-12-12 07:40:11] <+HousekiPhos> shit was hella funny
[2022-12-12 07:40:15] <+Mikazukix1> @wamukara Sureshot is easy to fit in, it's more like she gets hard stuck on tanks without GS and LW.

[2022-12-12 07:43:27] <@%SpikeLuk> you can have zed as a secondary carry on a zoe comp too
[2022-12-12 07:43:34] <@%SpikeLuk> or a 2 carry comp
[2022-12-12 07:43:38] <TheExistantOne> Zed kinda needs edge of night
[2022-12-12 07:43:42] <ParadoxNA> Edge of night +2

[2022-12-12 07:45:43] <%wamukara> depends who your carry is. can be admins/duelist/prankster
[2022-12-12 07:45:50] <+Mikazukix1> I feel like you always go the permanent hp admins.

[2022-12-12 07:46:55] <PathbreakingTale> when i play zed i like to go laser corp
[2022-12-12 07:46:58] <eladrin757> Zed Yasuo Sej Zoe is your core, rest is all flex
[2022-12-12 07:47:06] <+HousekiPhos> Ignore laser corp

[2022-12-12 07:47:14] <%totallynotahealermain> know***
[2022-12-12 07:47:15] <eladrin757> Generally it’s vi alistar ekko for the remaining slots
[2022-12-12 07:47:21] <+combowombowombo> for hacker zed i think its yasuo sejuani, vi ekko
[2022-12-12 07:47:27] <nubcakee> @eladrin757 --PogO--
[2022-12-12 07:47:29] <eladrin757> But sometimes you want 4 duelist
[2022-12-12 07:47:29] <%Im2Raw> sej, ekko, zoe, lb, yas, vi but you can change up some of the frontline
[2022-12-12 07:47:50] <+HousekiPhos> getting duelist rn is prob the best course of eaction
[2022-12-12 07:48:00] <%wamukara> if there's a lot of AP then vi Ali Ekko is nice sincr Aegis
[2022-12-12 07:48:04] <+combowombowombo> if you want to make zed the carry, recommend to swap ali for yasuo
[2022-12-12 07:48:10] <eladrin757> realistically, it’s Zed Zoe Yasuo Sej Vi Ekko + 2
[2022-12-12 07:48:15] <eladrin757> +2 being legendaries later
[2022-12-12 07:48:30] <%+MeijiDoom> could grab yasuo since he's there
[2022-12-12 07:48:36] <%+MeijiDoom> gets you duelist and eventual lasercorp with sej
[2022-12-12 07:48:42] <+HousekiPhos> you could, and i mean COULD slam the qss now
[2022-12-12 07:48:44] <eladrin757> But mid game the +2 is usually 4 duelist with like Nilah Vayne

[2022-12-12 07:48:54] <PathbreakingTale> u might not like zed since he ad
[2022-12-12 07:48:57] <TheExistantOne> 3 Lazer is only good early game
[2022-12-12 07:49:18] <@%SpikeLuk> he really needs edge of night tho HahaSweat
[2022-12-12 07:49:27] <+combowombowombo> yeah morello on zoe + blue bluff is actually a ton of damage because of the morello procs

[2022-12-12 07:49:28] <+HousekiPhos> edge of night would be ideal yes
[2022-12-12 07:49:30] <selfieday> Yeah you can skip yasuo to put in Fiora for ox force if you run Ali front line
[2022-12-12 07:49:33] <+combowombowombo> the number is a bit misleading

[2022-12-12 07:53:06] <%+MeijiDoom> you dont need admin
[2022-12-12 07:53:09] <eladrin757> Admin is pretty whatever
[2022-12-12 07:53:09] <+combowombowombo> admin depends on the perk
[2022-12-12 07:53:16] <+combowombowombo> admin with +60 ad is BUSTED
[2022-12-12 07:53:17] <+HousekiPhos> its pretty good for your team
[2022-12-12 07:53:20] <eladrin757> Another aegis or 4 duelist would both be far better for you on 8
[2022-12-12 07:53:25] <+HousekiPhos> but you need levels and to two star units
[2022-12-12 07:53:25] <nubcakee> admin is meh without blitz augment

[2022-12-12 07:56:09] <eladrin757> Oh I think the easiest top 4 comps this patch is jax
[2022-12-12 07:56:11] <%+MeijiDoom> yeah, ekko for now
[2022-12-12 07:56:11] <+combowombowombo> u dont need ali for this comp

[2022-12-12 07:56:14] <BookDux> @starsmitten also frontlining ekko would be better he is prankster so he wont die and they will focus the dummy
[2022-12-12 07:56:15] <nubcakee> not really

[2022-12-12 07:57:12] <eladrin757> Zed itemization is just avoid IE/Rageblade/BT/HoJ
[2022-12-12 07:57:15] <+combowombowombo> i would just go for zed 2 and keep current comp
[2022-12-12 07:57:16] <+HousekiPhos> selling lb and zoes here is prob the consistent play
[2022-12-12 07:57:20] <eladrin757> With hoj being the most eh somewhat acceptable
[2022-12-12 07:57:30] <+combowombowombo> lb 3 wont matter since no items
[2022-12-12 07:57:34] <+combowombowombo> zoe 3 is ok
[2022-12-12 07:57:34] <%totallynotahealermain> it's ok i got a couple pieces from the trials today
[2022-12-12 07:57:41] <@%SpikeLuk> combowombowombo she has lb 1 lol
[2022-12-12 07:57:49] <%+MeijiDoom> yeah, it's crazy
[2022-12-12 07:57:55] <+combowombowombo> oh
[2022-12-12 07:57:59] <+Mikazukix1> Zoe 3 is strong but your econ isn't amazing.
[2022-12-12 07:58:02] <+HousekiPhos> just sell
[2022-12-12 07:58:14] <%Im2Raw> i mean if you could sure but its not the focus of the comp
[2022-12-12 07:58:14] <%+MeijiDoom> depends how greedy you wanted to be
[2022-12-12 07:58:19] <+combowombowombo> lb 1 -> 2 is a pretty decent upgrade
