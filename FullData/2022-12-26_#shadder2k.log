[2022-12-26 17:10:38] <%+the25thsimpcoomer> you still have to pay for solar
[2022-12-26 17:10:41] <%+Wasdniak> somewhat
[2022-12-26 17:10:45] <%AngryBanana10> Also need a battery
[2022-12-26 17:10:52] <TehAutumnCore> free energy yeah, pays the electricity bill
[2022-12-26 17:10:53] <%AngryBanana10> To store the energy
[2022-12-26 17:10:57] <Javion> cost like 50k to install though
[2022-12-26 17:10:57] <%$主播嫁我 (dracala31)> battery
[2022-12-26 17:11:03] <CaeNLiM> depending oh how much energy you spend. also you need batteries to store the energy.
[2022-12-26 17:11:07] <+TommyDoesntMiss> Solar is a supplemental system, I don't think a reasonable amount of panels powers a fully used house
[2022-12-26 17:11:08] <scyve_> they still power at night just a lot less then during daytime
[2022-12-26 17:11:11] <justgetalifelol> really good investment in the long run
[2022-12-26 17:11:11] <mrreklez> it stores it in a battery bro
[2022-12-26 17:11:22] <CaeNLiM> if you dont spend too much, yea you can live on solar energy only
[2022-12-26 17:11:31] <%+Wasdniak> even with solar roof tiles, it's more supplemental
[2022-12-26 17:11:32] <yhwacheu> imagine hide and seek or catching there

[2022-12-26 17:12:27] <bsunder> solar pannels are goated tho
[2022-12-26 17:12:28] <%AngryBanana10> they lose efficiency over time
[2022-12-26 17:12:44] <bsunder> so cheap for the amount of energy u save
[2022-12-26 17:12:48] <justgetalifelol> they definitely need a lot of maintenance

[2022-12-26 17:13:16] <Sefiyrin> after the 20/25th tyear then the efficiency goes down like 5% a year

[2022-12-26 20:28:34] <Mrommy> @Pomato as long as its doing dmg, its duration doesn't tick down; you have to be behind shield or LOS it
