[2023-01-08 08:22:47] <Bugacman> You mignt think about installing some custom lifting mechanics on the wall :D
[2023-01-08 08:23:05] <MadZed5> The SmartDesk Connect lifting capacity is 350 pounds, which is much more than other brands. Autonomous has many standing desks, and none can carry that much weight, though some come close.

[2023-01-08 08:35:55] <+martymcflizzy> it doesnt say that it will crush. you just cant raise the table when there are 70kg on it
[2023-01-08 08:35:57] <%peegee87> you can make love on that...just adjusting the height during the action
[2023-01-08 08:36:03] <%+dereul3r> at the motors was a weight
[2023-01-08 08:36:06] <%peegee87> is not possible
[2023-01-08 08:36:12] <%Bhaal570> 160kg it was standing there ^^
[2023-01-08 08:36:49] <%+Di3sel88> @peegee87 but we want to go up and down with the table during the action
[2023-01-08 08:37:01] <Bugacman> Be warned that lifting power not = static load, proceed with caution :)

[2023-01-08 08:51:10] <%Bhaal570> @P4wnyhof call them tomorrow and ask ^^
[2023-01-08 08:51:25] <+Rammy_101> how can they limit the size ye
[2023-01-08 08:51:34] <%Bhaal570> but if balanced it shouldnt be a problem

[2023-01-08 08:51:52] <!%armandharmes> I'm on Autonomous site and they say that it could lift 320 pound
[2023-01-08 08:52:01] <%KiraAyashi> I suppose it is so you dont oversize and then put all your shit on one side? LUL
[2023-01-08 08:52:05] <Niriada> It could loose stability
[2023-01-08 08:52:12] <%+Di3sel88> no but the sacking on the overhanging is a problem
[2023-01-08 08:52:35] <Bugacman> guess its a balance issue for the lifting mechanic, but as long as You can install it centered its okay
[2023-01-08 08:53:01] <%+Di3sel88> yes
[2023-01-08 08:53:02] <Selebrimbor> they just not reqommending huge overhang

[2023-01-08 08:53:17] <+Rammy_101> depends on the tabletop @di3sel88
[2023-01-08 08:53:32] <%Bhaal570> i think its because of the overlapping, and the frame is only 295cm wide i think, based on the pictures
