[2023-01-03 15:33:49] <%Pagrax> Doing well, although my computer is having some issues so it keeps freezing every few seconds which basically makes it unusable right now :(

[2023-01-03 15:35:38] <%Pagrax> Yes, sadly the issue persists. Either software is broke or I might need a new GPU. Either way, troublesome
[2023-01-03 15:35:42] <Gobfather> @Pagrax have you tried whispering in its ear?
[2023-01-03 15:36:07] <Gobfather> @Pagrax have you tried booting into safe mode to see if the problem persists?

[2023-01-03 15:37:19] <%Pagrax> @Gobfather Not yet. Trying to troubleshoot now. It was fine for ~2 hours after reboot and then the issue came back again. So it's sadly just intermittent enough to struggle diagnosing it.

[2023-01-03 16:12:11] <%Kaete7> i did make a discovery in biotech kiri, i was able to make genes that overrides another's gene so i made a pigskin race into a dirtmole basically. :3

[2023-01-03 16:12:56] <%Kaete7> it takes a long time to get all the genes and even then it's a custom gene that you create

[2023-01-03 16:13:34] <%Kaete7> so technically you could create your own race, or genetic race...
[2023-01-03 16:13:48] <@%Dappdude> that's pretty cool
[2023-01-03 16:14:08] <Pellinova> I have to get ready to go back to school.  But I really really don't want to

[2023-01-03 16:15:14] <%Kaete7> if you extract genes too soon off of 1 person they will die but it can take their genes randomly
[2023-01-03 16:15:22] <%Kaete7> you can also do this to prisoners

[2023-01-03 16:51:31] <+TooTired2Care> I really hate that when you do the crashlanded neanderthal tech start. That when you research things, your research era doesn't go up and will stay in the stone ages even if you can make lasers lol
[2023-01-03 16:51:54] <ozspoz> I like that you say "we" hate the sunlight
[2023-01-03 16:52:13] <Calamity_Kyle> Yes. Darkness. Good.
[2023-01-03 16:52:29] <+gualdhar> @tootired2care research Era is a multiplier on research speed, not a description of your current tech level
[2023-01-03 16:52:30] <%rselbo> if you start as tribal you stay tribal tech level even though you have researched spaceflight
[2023-01-03 16:52:34] <+Zyian> Did you ever re-build the crafting table after you moved it to make way for the tunnels?
[2023-01-03 16:52:36] <+TooTired2Care> when you look at the research and hover over a tech, it will say what "Era" of research you're in based on the start you chose. These "Eras" will make some (or all) techs take longer because they're "futuristic"
[2023-01-03 16:52:38] <ozspoz> Hmmmm, that could be fun, hope there is darkness in Paris then

[2023-01-03 16:53:25] <+gualdhar> @tootired2care that would make tribal starts way too OP
