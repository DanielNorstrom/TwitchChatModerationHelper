[2022-12-02 15:15:23] <qqtenko> @Multipedten24 thank you! Wonder how they're going to justify hundreds of reloads due to Cohh's failed stealth attempts
[2022-12-02 15:15:24] <ZeDocteur> I'm so lost already

[2022-12-02 15:16:35] <%+Negat1veJ> @Hatedfollower switching to dx11 and setting framerate cap to 60 fixed most of the stuttering for him
[2022-12-02 15:16:36] <+saltysurprize> they went overboard with the stobing lights
[2022-12-02 15:16:36] <@%^CohhilitionBot> @saltysurprize cohhHi Welcome to the channel! cohhGV Enjoy your stay cohhL
[2022-12-02 15:16:39] <%Hese_1> @CohhCarnage maybe go and take the fuse if you can open doors here?
[2022-12-02 15:16:39] <%+MarvSR> @zenpringle, yes
[2022-12-02 15:16:40] <FatHalpert> danHi cohh, mods, chat danLove how's the game so far??

[2022-12-02 15:16:41] <jmaskell> how are there so many reviews when the game literally just came out?
[2022-12-02 15:16:41] <+Yasson> @lxmanbearpigxl - that's sad... :(
[2022-12-02 15:16:42] <Phoeniixx7> @hatedfollower, yes but he reduced it quite a bit by doing dx11 and limit fps to 60
[2022-12-02 15:16:43] <Imoxali> @DragonFlamely yes but he fixed some of it but it is still stuttering at times, if it becomes too much he said he will try the PS5 version
[2022-12-02 15:16:43] <%srauon> rude
[2022-12-02 15:16:43] <SlowDanceChubby_> apparently turning off vsync and motion blur should help with stutter issues

[2022-12-02 15:16:56] <JudgeGhosst> @zenpringle yeah, he switcehd to dx11 and 60fps limiter, and it is working a bit better
[2022-12-02 15:16:56] <koanchap> I heard this game is more action than horror, has it been spooky chat monkaS it feels spooky

[2022-12-02 15:26:16] <%Tobin> only tears i see is when cohh makes a huge mistake NODDERS
[2022-12-02 15:26:16] <%+KeymonkJ> Best In Peace?
[2022-12-02 15:26:16] <+schnitzelmeisterdude> There definitely is some screen tearing in the stream for me
[2022-12-02 15:26:18] <Vladan997> The game has problems with stuttering that was sad by most of the rewies
[2022-12-02 15:26:20] <MythicalSnake> a big screen will show the tearing on stream, that's why its fine for some and not for others
[2022-12-02 15:26:21] <+reaver752> frame rate seems weird but it may be due to the flashing lights
[2022-12-02 15:26:23] <%+drakduck7> no tearing here, just the little bits of stutter
[2022-12-02 15:26:23] <%fluffygemini> I don't knoww, I'm here for the cat cohhL

[2022-12-02 15:26:25] <Mr_Nitcap> get your bioshock implant
[2022-12-02 15:26:25] <+SiriusNick> lots of screen tearing. particularly noticable in front of lights. v sync is off so it's to be expected
[2022-12-02 15:26:27] <FlyCamel> Annoying, cant get drop to appear in game
[2022-12-02 15:26:27] <@%BearlyArcane> @Evisired @RobQuark not spoilers as already happened
[2022-12-02 15:26:28] <%Puchmannen> what platforms are this game on??
[2022-12-02 15:26:28] <+tomkc518> yeah i saw some tearing too
[2022-12-02 15:26:31] <%aslird> @yares33 how does viewing a video cause tearing on our side?
[2022-12-02 15:26:32] <+RyokoShaTV> I think the caching is not implemented well and memory usage management
[2022-12-02 15:26:32] <Icaryon> actually its Best in Pieces
[2022-12-02 15:26:33] <Timmypwn> thanks for the catchup @BearlyArcane

[2022-12-02 15:26:36] <C0RnHoLE> the same people who made Dead Space made this game too?
[2022-12-02 15:26:37] <varnavazubarev> dx11 is magic
[2022-12-02 15:26:37] <+Br3adl3y> it was really noticable in the dark operating room
[2022-12-02 15:26:39] <%$wakeDEADMAN> Can you not run in this game? Is it walk only?
[2022-12-02 15:26:39] <Neverywhere> Maybe try disabling "Low Latency" in the stream settings if you have screen tearing?
[2022-12-02 15:26:39] <@%^CohhilitionBot> cohhHi WAKEdeadman has arrived to soak up the good vibes!

[2022-12-02 15:26:41] <AimbotPharah> for now atpCap
[2022-12-02 15:26:41] <%Siedhr> it feels like its running on 40-50 fps
[2022-12-02 15:26:42] <heisenbergman> sorry just started watching, how many times during the stream has the game been compared to Dead Space already? :D
[2022-12-02 15:26:42] <Kohder_> @KeymonkJ Black Iron Prison I believe
[2022-12-02 15:26:43] <%Evisired> @BearlyArcane Spoiling the past cohhRude
[2022-12-02 15:26:44] <+HappyQuill> The game looks dope as hell to be honest.  I will still wait on buying it till next year when they fix the stutter problem, my 2060 ain't gonna hold this shit together xD
[2022-12-02 15:26:44] <+chrisabbott91> @CohhCarnage Have you listened to all of the voice recordings?
[2022-12-02 15:26:44] <Blu3Flow> there are both. tearing mostly when opening doors. stuttering while loading new stuff

[2022-12-02 15:33:38] <%Multipedten24> @xzaven switching to dx11 and setting framerate cap to 60 fixed most of the stuttering for him
[2022-12-02 15:33:38] <tommyp915> oooo new weapon
[2022-12-02 15:33:38] <+Braideraid> many deaths run

[2022-12-02 15:33:44] <fauxromano> @mrbonoso it's just dead space's mechanic to confirm they're dead
[2022-12-02 15:33:45] <Gus6gus7> hmmm well at least ... it is a game Kappa
[2022-12-02 15:33:45] <%Tarquinius1> @Xzaven DX12 is borked, it stopped stuttering when he went to DX11

[2022-12-02 15:33:50] <+ShawBMC> @CohhCarnage I think once you have shooty weapons it'll have less of a significance
[2022-12-02 15:33:52] <h1n9x> stomp

[2022-12-02 15:37:11] <plzdonthurtme91> @CohhCarnage there is a block mechanic to reduce incoming damage!

[2022-12-02 15:37:13] <+mewantcoffee> @akellz22 from what I've read, this game was made for ps5 and the stutters on pc are a garbage port. the ps5 is supposedly fine
[2022-12-02 15:37:13] <%+GrimEnd> and thats why Cohh was put in prison ... the guard was right all along
[2022-12-02 15:37:13] <%Tarquinius1> @iconixz_ nah, just switch to DX11 and dont use DX12

[2022-12-02 15:40:13] <mael_jade> wow, only 5 hits to remove an arm and 6 to kill!
[2022-12-02 15:40:16] <%ImaginaryExponent> this IS a dead space game. It might be named differently but this is Dead Space.

[2022-12-02 15:40:21] <Misfit_XD_> and it seems like when you're soft locked to one enemy the other kinda waits its turn
[2022-12-02 15:40:22] <+LtLeotard> If only you had some sort of gun...
[2022-12-02 15:40:22] <@%Suzunahara> @WaterPig1951 it's not. But it was made by the Dead Space devs and is a similar type of game

[2022-12-02 15:56:50] <riki2x> maybe there is something that you can't dodge?
[2022-12-02 15:56:51] <%+realfprintf> Buy ammo, cohh?

[2022-12-02 15:57:01] <tripstn> @blazinmonkey oof that's unfortunate, ill probably be playing on ps5. hopefully they fix that
[2022-12-02 15:57:01] <%+Thundercall> The upgrades seem not worth for block (take dmg) and combo (you wont get it off)

[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <rkarker08> horror games are so much less scary after alien isolation lol. That game scares the pants off of me, and not in the good way
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <luc4s3330> lol xD
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <%Nicklorion> fear*
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <Vyrthur97> PLay it alone in a dark room with a nice headset and tell me you dont get goosebumps
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <+virtualsalesman> idk I felt like deadpace put more effort into spook
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <ShowtimeTylers> it may as well not have horror in the arch-type
[2022-12-02 16:14:07] <0Geralt> is cohh playing with raytracing on ?

[2022-12-02 16:14:10] <PsychOnRails> Callisto seems to rely more on jump scares
[2022-12-02 16:14:10] <%deganitos> Dead Spaxe scared the shit outta me, specially the second one

[2022-12-02 16:14:20] <@%Suzunahara> @0Geralt he isn't. He's on DX11 to help with stuttering which means no ray tracing
[2022-12-02 16:14:21] <thebaitman317> Dead space was way more scary tbh

[2022-12-02 16:14:51] <%Samow4r> Dead Space wasnt that scary chat, its nostalgia. I replayed it like 2 years ago, after like 1 hour of gameplay you get completely desensitised to the necromorphs.

[2022-12-02 16:15:14] <%+linkiron25> @CohhCarnage Heads up - Saving doesn't work how you think it does. It saves at the last checkpoint, regardless of what've you done since then.

[2022-12-02 16:20:49] <@%Suzunahara> @Thorrox performance issues can be minimized by swapping to DX11 and capping FPS to 60

[2022-12-02 16:22:42] <@%Suzunahara> @Fallenarch11 Cohh's really enjoying it so far ^^. But it does have some performance issues on PC. Setting to DX11 and capping FPS to 60 helps a lot with them
[2022-12-02 16:22:44] <+Witherfang> Sounds like we have found our Hans Tiedeemannn antagonist a la Dead Space 2

The combat is visceral, and works most of the time as intended, few bumps with the dodge system but it is a damn good time

[2022-12-02 16:26:28] <Kerrty> Everything is so squishy
[2022-12-02 16:26:30] <intraz> @Tarquinius1 ok thanks. good to know

[2022-12-02 16:26:35] <%+don_dingdong> For now it seems not soo rewarding to look everywhere esp. every corner, not so many hidden objects or loot. I'm not talking about optional areas, they are "fine".. how do you feel about it cohh? @CohhCarnage
[2022-12-02 16:26:36] <tommyp915> if there were generous checkpoints, people would call the game too easy, so you actually cant win LULW
[2022-12-02 16:26:37] <+fohhrzenttv> This is pc version. stutters usually get resolved with drivers/patches quickly

[2022-12-02 16:26:42] <rogue_nightbot> how does stabbing them in the head with a shiv kill them but blowing their head off not kill them??
[2022-12-02 16:26:47] <maianja> @astorma haha well I guess that makes sense.

[2022-12-02 16:26:53] <@%Suzunahara> @jamesjameson66 it has performance issues, but DX11 instead of 12 and capping FPS to 60 will minimize a lot of it

[2022-12-02 16:29:30] <rkarker08> @TrystnS because games cost $70

[2022-12-02 16:29:34] <packapunch2250> Is the 28 health because it‚Äôs the hardest difficulty?
[2022-12-02 16:29:34] <mosaic____> is this basically just deadspace
[2022-12-02 16:29:34] <%Tarquinius1> @Suzunahara this pretty much sums up most of the the fixes https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/the-callisto-protocol-frame-rate-issues-and-performance-mode/z54d85

[2022-12-02 16:29:51] <VoxDeus99> @MikeGGz he seems fine with it and viewers can see 60 fps max anyways
[2022-12-02 16:29:51] <+max_rebo_band> no one wants to pay 70 for a game that isn't well polished.
[2022-12-02 16:29:51] <OMM94> @TrystnS Because Gamers became critiques

[2022-12-02 16:30:18] <WretchedMonarch> @max_rebo_band never preorder
[2022-12-02 16:30:19] <@%nuuriell> Aracdar No.
[2022-12-02 16:30:19] <Deli_Ninja> @TrystnS partly because it breaks flow. and when the flow breaks, it is hard to ignore what broke the flow. i hope you understand my explanation.
[2022-12-02 16:30:21] <+Cyloric> according to EA as long as it goes out, its polished hahaha
[2022-12-02 16:30:22] <zzalamandrr> @TrystnS why would you be happy spending money on something that is subpar?
[2022-12-02 16:30:26] <%Van_Cross> maybe
[2022-12-02 16:30:28] <CROWDIE1996> is the game actually that bad performance wise like the reviews say?
[2022-12-02 16:30:28] <%$lieutenantcawley> Is it buggy?
[2022-12-02 16:30:28] <tommyp915> @ATimeTortoise only when he had dx12 on and unlimited frames
[2022-12-02 16:30:28] <%pastori1988> @nuuriell Good Morning cohhHug cohhL
[2022-12-02 16:30:29] <@%BearlyArcane> @zecterss medium DX11 with motion blur off and frame cap to 60
[2022-12-02 16:30:31] <aimgandalf> mediocre game imo
[2022-12-02 16:30:33] <Coekie92> Its like buying a new car that looks and sounds great. But the engine  only works at random
[2022-12-02 16:30:35] <Kerrty> !drops

[2022-12-02 16:30:41] <+lucmorel> what a thrill
[2022-12-02 16:30:42] <+ResoluteSky> @CohhCarnage not sure if you noticed but enemies with two arms usually do two attacks, once you blow off an arm you only have to worry about a single strike
[2022-12-02 16:30:42] <%TrystnS> @KurisuTheNinja Dont see anything bad impacting enjoyment here and havent seen it in other games yet people will still nitpick on the bad
[2022-12-02 16:30:43] <+theweeknddark> did gameplay just start?
[2022-12-02 16:30:44] <%+aurice_heartly> Max rage quit this game LUL
[2022-12-02 16:30:48] <+MikeGGz> kinda sucks how so many games release with issues now. I mean look at Halo Infinite and Call of Duty...
[2022-12-02 16:30:48] <replay2315> @CohhCarnage are you gonna do all endings
[2022-12-02 16:30:48] <redmor1> cohh has beast machine though
[2022-12-02 16:30:50] <kaynos1972> motion blur seems to fix stutter from what I read
[2022-12-02 16:30:52] <%full_thr0ttlekevin> overreacting reviews cohhOld
[2022-12-02 16:30:53] <@%nuuriell> Good morning, pastori1988 cohhHug
[2022-12-02 16:30:54] <%+theywhodreams> you missed a path down there

[2022-12-02 16:30:57] <%cynful3> There's medicine for performance issues, it's 2022
[2022-12-02 16:30:58] <GoldIncome> I see some stuttering on screen
[2022-12-02 16:31:02] <jamesjameson66> looks like your on Low Graphics
[2022-12-02 16:31:02] <+Shobe__> Cant max out graphics with 3090 burkeSus
[2022-12-02 16:31:03] <+justgoosing> stutter always exists on high tech
[2022-12-02 16:31:04] <+teh_dark> how did you adjusted, wich settings

[2022-12-02 16:31:09] <farcryer2> He is playing on medium and DX11. It has terrible optimisation
[2022-12-02 16:31:10] <Sohvren> yeah you can tell game totally looks crap with these graphics Kappa
[2022-12-02 16:31:11] <WretchedMonarch> 3090 not enough KEKW
[2022-12-02 16:31:13] <%Brobonobo> @Neuro_25 i had an mmo itch lately , maybe what is shown tomorrow helps.
[2022-12-02 16:31:14] <+GunganJedi> Cohh has a high tolerance for jank
[2022-12-02 16:31:14] <@%Suzunahara> @teh_dark check this link for which settings are important to adjust ^^ https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/the-callisto-protocol-frame-rate-issues-and-performance-mode/z54d85
[2022-12-02 16:31:15] <Bryantheart> @TrystnS What worse is people gave a review on what they heard. Even on Steam. They buy the game, give a bad review and said "I said the game is bad bla bla bla, so I refund it". Play hour 0,1 LUL
[2022-12-02 16:31:16] [Announcement] <CohhilitionBot> cohhRave Cohh just posted a new YouTube Short! cohhGG Check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUdWSzKJeDk cohhGV
[2022-12-02 16:31:18] <ph4l4nx3r> all you need is a 12000 dollar PC and set the game to low :)
[2022-12-02 16:31:18] <yares33> recommended for ultra is 3080
[2022-12-02 16:31:19] <+lillitosuave> Ok so people are over exaggerating as hsual
[2022-12-02 16:31:21] <thewheregohere2> Hows the game so far?
[2022-12-02 16:31:21] <Neo_Overdrive> it just doesnt seem well optimized
[2022-12-02 16:31:22] <intraz> hey @Suzunahara ü§ó
[2022-12-02 16:31:23] <uTOOez> i thought this game is coming out february what a surprise for me LUL
[2022-12-02 16:31:24] <LordDrakor> its not just on high end
[2022-12-02 16:31:24] <%vare91> cohhHi  cohh mods and chat
[2022-12-02 16:31:25] <tommyp915> works for me, I never play games on max :)
[2022-12-02 16:31:25] <%+Crasysnake11> cohh run back and check if you can go to the store
[2022-12-02 16:31:25] <%+Metathor> is there an option to zoom out a bit more?
[2022-12-02 16:31:25] <+Andy_Lunique> It seems to be PC having the most issues with console being prioritized for optimization.
[2022-12-02 16:31:26] <%Torse9> @Multipedten24 Hello Fellow Norwegian cohhL
[2022-12-02 16:31:26] <cheeks_actual> devs meant to say this game will turn your PC into an xbox series s KEKW

[2022-12-02 16:31:32] <+D3Kurisu> what you see its not stuttering its called tearing
[2022-12-02 16:31:32] <%Captainkingdog> I've heard some people have had crashes too, so I don't think graphics is the only problem.
[2022-12-02 16:31:32] <Sanguinae> could you break that glass window?
[2022-12-02 16:31:36] <%CaedusEnraged> lol
[2022-12-02 16:31:37] <%Multipedten24> @torse9 cohhDap
[2022-12-02 16:31:38] <Bryantheart> @TrystnS *I heard
[2022-12-02 16:31:42] <%Koori_89> A few patches and a few Graphic driver updates and it should be good, game really got the short stick even on consoles there are reports for stutter
[2022-12-02 16:31:42] <+MikeGGz> @Andy_Lunique for sure. console first and then pc gets a shitty port
[2022-12-02 16:31:43] <erlex248> seems ppl say it is better to play on console if you have one
[2022-12-02 16:31:45] <%TrystnS> @zzalamandrr If you expect absolute perfection in everything you purchase then i guess thats your choice
[2022-12-02 16:31:45] <etherealsshadow> Break the glass
[2022-12-02 16:31:46] <%Nishok> cohhSave
[2022-12-02 16:31:46] <Fallenarch11> @CohhCarnage  is it worth the 70euro???? People are saying it's around a 10h playthrough on normal diff
[2022-12-02 16:31:46] <%$2packssugar> Any word on performance on consoles?
[2022-12-02 16:31:47] <%$Heretic379> @TrystnS Wouldn't you complain if someone overcooked your steak but the rest of your meal was fine? Similar argument here
[2022-12-02 16:31:49] <+DeviantAnt> The fire looks... terrible :D
[2022-12-02 16:31:49] <%cynful3> So the warden actually knows what's going on and is letting this happen, right?
[2022-12-02 16:31:50] <heavy_mouse> @lillitosuave yeah, I think it's an arkham knight release situation
[2022-12-02 16:31:50] <bakkoto> Are people really asking a sponsored streamer and expecting a 100% unbiased opinion LUL
[2022-12-02 16:31:52] <%full_thr0ttlekevin> no cohhScum Kappa
[2022-12-02 16:31:52] <Zonder1994> this launch issues in games are the reason i don't preorder anymore. learn my lesson. wait for the game to get better
[2022-12-02 16:31:55] <Montblack007> u can break most glass
[2022-12-02 16:31:55] <+max_rebo_band> cohhs pc is like an Olympic athlete on every steroid and its having issues playing this
[2022-12-02 16:31:57] <%+aurice_heartly> @Saurabh_DT he got fed up with the cheapness on this game and he was playing on Normal, so he decided to play EVIL WEST instead and plans to play it again on YoVG this weekend
[2022-12-02 16:31:57] <%+drakduck7> u missed something shiny on a shelf back there
[2022-12-02 16:31:57] <+Andy_Lunique> hey buddy :) always a pleasure
[2022-12-02 16:31:57] <etherealsshadow> Go back
[2022-12-02 16:31:58] <kaynos1972> the checkpoint system seems real bad, save often
[2022-12-02 16:31:58] <+Stubbs324> its just another Day 1 game. Hopefully some patch and optimization come out before everyone beats it lol
[2022-12-02 16:31:59] <+Ravos95> locking to 60fps isn't a valid workaround for me personally when I've invested the money for a 3080ti but hey just my personal opinion.
[2022-12-02 16:31:59] <%Tarquinius1> @2packssugar better than pc
[2022-12-02 16:31:59] <%+CasualKev> so slow quick save
[2022-12-02 16:31:59] <%naughtygnome_> normal glass is titanium glass in callisto
[2022-12-02 16:32:00] <@%Suzunahara> @2packssugar Consoles are good ^^. PS5 is best, Xbox is still solid though
[2022-12-02 16:32:02] <+Tiernan34> I think they patched it last night shortly after launch too, MaximillionDude had it on steam and despite lowering settings, using dx11, etc, couldn't get it to be a good for his standards, so he ended up refunding and getting it on PS5.
[2022-12-02 16:32:03] <%deganitos> A bunch of rich spoiled brats complaining about their 4Ks and ray tracing, as usual, the 1% whining like babies
[2022-12-02 16:32:03] <misprobleem> try to kill the big robot mby ?
[2022-12-02 16:32:03] <Punch_McJudochop> well thats just quick save with extra steps Kappa

[2022-12-02 16:32:10] <%Ragevamp666> bakkoto you can here
[2022-12-02 16:32:10] <%+linkiron25> Manually saving just saves at the checkpoint. Found that out the hard way lol
[2022-12-02 16:32:10] <%ChunkSnorris> That was glass
[2022-12-02 16:32:10] <itslilithsan> why anyone want turn their pc into oven on max graphics
[2022-12-02 16:32:11] <Tnobuhiko> manual save just saves to checkpoint so no save scum

[2022-12-02 16:32:12] <thewheregohere2> Is it scary or not really
[2022-12-02 16:32:15] <%Brobonobo> Game still looks good but nothing compated to the after effects trailers - like every game.
[2022-12-02 16:32:15] <ACGsteve> Andy = baby
[2022-12-02 16:32:18] <Karohemd> @full_thr0ttlekevin I wouldn't. GoWR has a much better story, is much longer with amazing, varied locations, lots of side content etc. etc.

[2022-12-02 16:32:26] <Aracdar> @nuuriell Thanks. Was thinking because Cohh is a 'brand' kinda, he might have to worry what brands think about the whole twitter thing (pulling ads and so on).
[2022-12-02 16:32:27] <+gGhote> Is this game wraught with attrition? games like this are often quickly ruin with a lack of resources.

[2022-12-02 16:32:59] <yares33> thats how the game ends up if they make money from preorders, imagine how many people would buy this without preorder :D

[2022-12-02 16:33:19] <+MikeGGz> it's fine to be ok with 60fps, but it's also 2022 and achieving > 60fps shouldnt be an outrageous want
[2022-12-02 16:33:21] <NoTToXiCLuL> its quiet simple people always expect things to work first day and when it doesnt they talk Shitaki sauce all over it
[2022-12-02 16:33:24] <Vyrthur97> wus B.I.P stand for? what prison?
[2022-12-02 16:33:28] <etherealsshadow> Room on fire has glass window that is breakable
[2022-12-02 16:33:28] <Neuro_25> yeah @Brobonobo I've been wanting to see it, don't have the pre-alpha so hoping to see some nice upgrades. I'm guessing they're letting Cohh stream it
[2022-12-02 16:33:28] <misprobleem> what if u kill the  robot ?

[2022-12-02 16:33:33] <tommyp915> @Baaru5 then watch something else 4Head

[2022-12-02 16:33:36] <%+WildRose2743> @WildRose2743 Oh shit for real? No wonder! I'll definitely give this a try at some point before the end of the year
[2022-12-02 16:33:38] <CarrotWhisky> Kinda feels as if this game had a rushed release due to not wanting to compete with Dead Space Remake; maybe some more time in the oven for some optimization would have been warranted.
[2022-12-02 16:33:38] <Eddykin> Hiya there Cohh love the beard!

[2022-12-02 16:33:42] <Fallenarch11> Is it worth the 70euro ??? since people are saying the game is short around 10h on normal diff @CohhCarnage
[2022-12-02 16:33:46] <Bowlseppe_> @misprobleem you can‚Äôt unfortunately
[2022-12-02 16:33:48] <01DNS> SMOrc
[2022-12-02 16:33:50] <clackalacka> did cohh play signalis? that game is pretty great
[2022-12-02 16:33:50] <+Demonsaeri> @NoTToXiCLuL I see both sides of it. Games should 100% be tested more before sent out.
[2022-12-02 16:33:50] <+bryanwright0> I assume hardest difficulty
[2022-12-02 16:33:50] <Aracdar> @nuuriell I thought so. In the end twitter will probably surive it or less likely it will die and content creators will move to the next platform.
[2022-12-02 16:33:54] <@%nuuriell> It's always funny when people walk in and say Cohh's opinion is biased about a game because he's sponsored to play it and don't realise that's not how it works here.
[2022-12-02 16:33:56] <@%Suzunahara> @clackalacka he did, he really liked it ^^
[2022-12-02 16:33:57] <ceano96> @CohhCarnage safe before u have to do everything again
[2022-12-02 16:33:57] <+Rakinos> surely that thing won't come out Kappa
[2022-12-02 16:33:58] <HyperTac0> You know hes not staying right there!

[2022-12-02 16:34:03] <Vulture2k> @clackalacka he did ^^ a few endings and then watched the rest i think

[2022-12-02 16:34:04] <@%Suzunahara> @bryanwright0 you assume correctly ^^
[2022-12-02 16:34:05] <Marchi> CarrotWhisky that and virtually every other major release was delayed, seemed like they didn't want to be part of the crowd
[2022-12-02 16:34:05] <%ChunkSnorris> He will miss so much glass
[2022-12-02 16:34:07] <nvrmissashot> so did it say why this guy was a prisoner?

[2022-12-02 16:34:08] <diedact5099> Do we have a reason why Cohh isn't infected so far?
[2022-12-02 16:34:09] <@%nuuriell> Aracdar We'll see how it goes. ^_^
[2022-12-02 16:34:11] <DoItJustDoIt> @trystns shipping unfinished products shouldn‚Äôt be tye industry standard
[2022-12-02 16:34:11] <torr1bl3> Chat help me understand, is this the new Dead Space or the one thats just like Dead Space?
[2022-12-02 16:34:13] <CmbtWombat> thats just the door you went through
[2022-12-02 16:34:14] <salobard> sure has a deapspace vibe. ...finally a good game. üòÅ
[2022-12-02 16:34:15] <%+stayupthetree> yup tested 100% for the thousands of different hardware combinations in existence
[2022-12-02 16:34:17] <Phoeniixx7> thats the door you opened cohh
[2022-12-02 16:34:18] <+Stubbs324> @nuuriell key word is "walk in". anyone who is here enough knows thats crap lol
[2022-12-02 16:34:18] <KurisuTheNinja> It‚Äôs not even the performance that‚Äôs the biggest issue. The combat is so basic you can literally play it with your eyes closed. It‚Äôs bafflingly simple.
[2022-12-02 16:34:22] <sinew_> showing you where it unlocks
[2022-12-02 16:34:22] <+justgoosing> skillups review did a good job summing the shortcomings of this game.
[2022-12-02 16:34:22] <furious256> What resolution are you playing on? I feel like new games really rely on 4k with high refresh rate to get the fidelity they are putting into the game.
[2022-12-02 16:34:22] <@%Suzunahara> @torr1bl3 it's like Dead Space but not actually Dead Space
[2022-12-02 16:34:22] <Bryantheart> @TrystnS People mostly only see what score on Review, without reading the problem. And basically nitpicking everything when they watch playthrough. For me, this game has stuttering issue, melee could be improve and less action. But overall the game is good. Not deserve 30%

[2022-12-02 16:34:43] <a__cucumber> @nuuriell totally understandable from an outsider's perspective. Probably best to not get worked up about it.

[2022-12-02 16:34:44] <CarrotWhisky> @Marchi Yeah, I suppose. 2023 alone is absolute packed with highly anticipated game, so maybe they wanted this out before 2022 ended.

[2022-12-02 16:35:53] <Cincy_SZN> Dead Space 3 was outstanding!!!

[2022-12-02 16:35:59] <+fohhrzenttv> this game is going to be gorgeous once the performance issues get patched and it can be cranked up

[2022-12-02 16:36:08] <+MrHardcoreMode> what about the little guys that grab?
[2022-12-02 16:36:09] <Fallenarch11> @CohhCarnage is it worth the 70euro since people are saying the game is short? around 10h on normal diff.
[2022-12-02 16:36:09] <%+WildRose2743> Wait, but didn't he sledgehammer your face once before freeing yourself from his grab?

[2022-12-02 16:36:12] <+jvarg> quote me chat, but I'll wager that the performance issues are due to the Denuvo DRM, and that once the devs decide to drop it, they will be a big performance boost
[2022-12-02 16:36:16] <Rydgel_> combat looks repetitive so far
[2022-12-02 16:36:16] <%+ArgonFalcon> Something about this reminds me of Dead space

[2022-12-02 16:36:18] <yourenext3_67> wish we had room in the prison wallet for the extra health
[2022-12-02 16:36:21] <%+MostDireOfWolves> Why not just use up all the pistol bullets and than when you are out use melee? Seems to make sense LUL
[2022-12-02 16:36:22] <@%Suzunahara> @pastori1988 very glad to hear it! so glad you're doing good cohhGV cohhCheer
[2022-12-02 16:36:23] <ShowtimeTylers> @nuuriell that may be true but to turn away from consumers being critical can lead to lazy dev design, no?

[2022-12-02 16:36:25] <%+WildRose2743> That would warrant some health loss. Being smacked in the face hurts

[2022-12-02 16:39:32] <%Koori_89> I struggle to see how some graphic stuttering is labeling the game as  "unfinished" product, the game is being released on at least 3-4 platforms, its normal to have problems on user end machine, testing in an isolated environment is one thing, also yes more polish can be used, but when you have a deadline you make due with what you have, or you get fined for hundreds of millions.

[2022-12-02 16:40:46] <@%Suzunahara> @AnonTT settings changes help a lot with the performance issues. you can read here if you're curious https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/the-callisto-protocol-frame-rate-issues-and-performance-mode/z54d85
[2022-12-02 16:40:48] <%Tarquinius1> @AnonTT need to adjust settings to make it work

[2022-12-02 16:40:58] <+JaiPoppaJ> this reminds me of deadspace
[2022-12-02 16:41:02] <CarrotWhisky> @ForMathMe I think part of the issue is that this game have you experiencing the horror outbreak at the beginning when it is occuring, whereas in Dead Space, you visit the aftermath of the Ishimura-outbreak that makes you take it a bit further in of what happened to the place.
[2022-12-02 16:41:09] <+Witchtripper_> @Suzunahara how's the best mod in twitch doing today?

[2022-12-02 16:43:10] <jozef_the_grey> since you capped fps the tearing started, has to do with twitch transcoding in 59.xx fps and youre running 60 fps. When you unlocked fps there was no tearing.

[2022-12-02 16:43:24] <%Koori_89> @Koori_89 Times have changed, CD / DVD games had to have much more polish because if you actually remember those times, if a game had a bug or a problem the patch would come out a month if not ages later, or have a community patch. Fun times
[2022-12-02 16:43:25] <kwibkwib> They meant FLESH TEARING Cohh)

[2022-12-02 16:43:33] <+MegamanBXR> The game looks great and looks gorgeous but even when it‚Äôs working to it‚Äôs fullest it doesn‚Äôt stop the gameplay being simplistic and unchallenging

[2022-12-02 16:43:46] <+Smashematics> could tearing be their monitor/graphic settings?

[2022-12-02 16:43:46] <%Darnitz> no tearing and I have it set at 1080p source
[2022-12-02 16:43:47] <Vulgar_Monkey> @CohhCarnage wasnt there some stream drop-outs a week or two ago that only affected viewers in certain regions?
[2022-12-02 16:43:47] <Eyeco2000> can see it bad on full screen
[2022-12-02 16:43:47] <Sonikgav> Are people watching on low quality?
[2022-12-02 16:43:47] <+Desaccorde> Seen the tearing
[2022-12-02 16:43:48] <Thereth> i only notice it when there are flashing lights around
[2022-12-02 16:43:48] <carlos_cintron> Its super clear and smooth to me

[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <Ellie_Stark_> i would mention it if there was tearing. I hate screen tearing WutFace
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <RealLifeTsundere> its tearing but its watchable
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <+tuktukNJ> Just want to point out that the prison has a major security flaw ‚Ä¶ cause u can open doors just by cutting one wire ‚Ä¶
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <+Br3adl3y> If I set quality to source it tears if I set it to automatic it is fine
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <Karohemd> Is there a map?
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <Cleric4gg> How's Cohh liking it so far?
[2022-12-02 16:43:52] <capacrush> as a spectator, it seems to miss a sense of genuine peril.
[2022-12-02 16:43:53] <$nitecrawlr> why did you drop to dx11?
[2022-12-02 16:43:54] <Bryantheart> Maybe their monitor is "Tearing" LUL
[2022-12-02 16:43:55] <%Erohook> No map Cohh ??
[2022-12-02 16:43:55] <MoistHeinous> tearing could be on twitch's end
[2022-12-02 16:43:55] <+DeadNations> Does Callisto tie in with Isaac's story and the Ishimura ?
[2022-12-02 16:43:55] <@%Suzunahara> @Xorats that's just where they install it on prisoners here
[2022-12-02 16:43:56] <%deganitos> people complaining about small stuff again FailFish BabyRage

[2022-12-02 16:43:56] <%+rossman4ever> does tearing still happening if you reduce the bitrate of the stream (chat)
[2022-12-02 16:43:57] <+Rigamaraw> @CohhCarnage I think it's a lighting issue and not tearing
[2022-12-02 16:43:57] <PhantomThiefZero> @CohhCarnage it seems mostly when the lights are flashing
[2022-12-02 16:43:58] <FaithlessGames> this is why we can never get a real account from reviews online 10 people will see no tearing and 1 will and the 1 is the guy who says it everywhere the loudest
[2022-12-02 16:43:59] <%RaidZer0_> I see a dingus on the bottom left cohhStare

[2022-12-02 16:44:03] <%Zucate> @Xorats its not for the character its for the player
[2022-12-02 16:44:04] <Vdio_> some probably think that the flickering lights is a screen tear
[2022-12-02 16:44:04] <+BODYTYPE_1> ^ppl think that flashing lighting is tearing
[2022-12-02 16:44:04] <$Yasuro82> People do not understand that we are all watching a same video‚Äùfile‚Äù. There is tearing for all or not.
[2022-12-02 16:44:04] <Variandra> @CohhCarnage its the peripheral view areas. like the floor as u run
[2022-12-02 16:44:05] <Thbigchief> Love is a strong word
[2022-12-02 16:44:05] <%+Coconutsales> How far in to the game is this?
[2022-12-02 16:44:06] <+timochi24> @CohhCarnage People will experience tearing if their monitor's fps is set above 60. My 1080p 60Hz monitor has no tearing, but my 1440p 144Hz monitor is tearing like crazy

[2022-12-02 16:44:16] <Lou_Mac21> It‚Äôs because of the quality of the video..I think that‚Äôs what making the lag
[2022-12-02 16:44:17] <+zakkdimebag> this is pc or console?

[2022-12-02 16:45:08] <+fohhrzenttv> when the lights strobe, I think i perceive slight tearing.. but you have to be studious to see it. otherwise, none

[2022-12-02 16:45:25] <@%BearlyArcane> @AscendTV it seems to depend on your monitors refresh rate

[2022-12-02 16:45:26] <Tagek> @trippingthedicefantastic tearing isn't really a stutter per se. This is definitely stutter territory
[2022-12-02 16:45:28] <+Rigamaraw> @serabobble Looks like it. Apparently from some of the original Dead Space devs.

[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <bigboiberserker> At least its performance, something that can be fixed opposed to the game just being bad.
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <konsto_> it would suck so hard if somebody else would come across you while inside the vents
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <+DeadNations> @Sh4nti Okay, thanks !
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <%SARCASTICJ> so triggering
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <Mickket> These seem like "loading screens"
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <KurisuTheNinja> Sick gameplay PogChamp
[2022-12-02 16:46:10] <Neo_Overdrive> these tunnels are spacious
[2022-12-02 16:46:11] <krawdead> does this game have loading screens or are these tunnels the loading screens?
[2022-12-02 16:46:11] <+aamef> Awesome, I love this quality vent gameplay.

[2022-12-02 16:46:21] <SupplyMyHigh93> this is to add to the gameplay completion time
[2022-12-02 16:46:21] <%Leviathansub> so, is it a bad time to say you missed an item there? bikePlot
[2022-12-02 16:46:22] <ogre3000> Too bad there's no Edi in this game
[2022-12-02 16:46:22] <Twaintoss> @CohhCarnage when you went the other way, it autosaved. So THIS might be the optional path actually

[2022-12-02 16:53:24] <%DeadlyMyth> was probably in that optional area LUL
[2022-12-02 16:53:27] <+Stygg3> how come some streamers has an hazy look to the game and some does not? all on PC ...
[2022-12-02 16:53:28] <tokinsmurf> this feels very dead spacey...
[2022-12-02 16:53:29] <+dahak777> maybe some of the stuff on the floor like boxes
[2022-12-02 16:53:30] <+xiv_magus> @1leggedroflcopter sad that games are releasing in this state, darktide now this? weak stuff devs
[2022-12-02 16:53:30] <@%^CohhilitionBot> @xiv_magus cohhHi Welcome to the channel! cohhGV Enjoy your stay cohhL
[2022-12-02 16:53:31] <SupplyMyHigh93> can you increase the throwing distance?
[2022-12-02 16:53:32] <%Hobahn> @CohhCarnage Can't you just grab random objects around the room to throw them?
[2022-12-02 16:53:33] <Capcaveman86> I tink this the max part kekw
[2022-12-02 16:53:34] <%Starwonders> Will cohh do a lunchbreak today?
[2022-12-02 16:53:36] <%LohenXI> oh I just missed a couple minutes, where did he get the gloves chat?
[2022-12-02 16:53:37] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Suzunahara mayhaps a totally derpy question, but did the devs set this in the same realm as Dead space?
[2022-12-02 16:53:38] <+Rigamaraw> The similarities to Dead Space are actually selling me on the game more than anything else
[2022-12-02 16:53:38] <RadiatedBones> Can you pick up objects in the area?
[2022-12-02 16:53:38] <%Shadow96002> Well you missed all the loot in the optional place Cohh

[2022-12-02 16:54:15] <Faintlich> Do the guns just not do anything
[2022-12-02 16:54:15] <CarrotWhisky> @Rigamaraw Gameplay-wise though, it seems a bit different from Dead Space though; alot more focus on melee and less on shooting and limb-cutting that DS was known for.
[2022-12-02 16:54:16] <%Captainkingdog> I don't think this game will give you lots of chances to sell loot or upgrade.

[2022-12-02 16:54:50] <+Andy_Lunique> I think the reviews on this game are based on folks who had to kind of fly through it. I know the POV on combat is probably consistent, but folks at gamespot seem to be harsh on all games

[2022-12-02 17:09:30] <@%nuuriell> mooop64 It worked for me.
[2022-12-02 17:09:31] <JoWingy> level design feels rather weak

[2022-12-02 17:09:32] <+flatpackedcorgi> Review scores for ps5 version are going up on meta, getting close to 80, pc just has some teething issues with most people Frankenstein made pcs with different parts, and remember shit reviews are VERY biased, I picked it up on pc at first and had an issue now got a refund and enjoying it on PlayStation, enjoy gaming people to escape the shitty reality issues  or for self-entertainment or just watch cohh play it like a badass

[2022-12-02 17:09:47] <Tiberious_Of_Elona_> Dx 11 is the play
[2022-12-02 17:09:47] <tommyp915> if you have a 4090 and on max settings sure but thats like 1% of gamers
[2022-12-02 17:09:49] <Caineisback> wait, i do a quick recap as i missed most of this, and now your redoing this part...
[2022-12-02 17:09:50] <redmor1> keep in mind cohh has a 3090

[2022-12-02 17:09:53] <+Simbac_> cant you just drop all the loot in the room and go back for the stuff now? @CohhCarnage
[2022-12-02 17:09:56] <unqltango> What√°s your graphics card?
[2022-12-02 17:09:56] <%ImJustRoids> @amoureuxkabbaliste some folks having problems on DX12 and or super high settings. May need to adjust until patching.
[2022-12-02 17:09:56] <Mohktor> Looks like a cheap Dead Space ripoff. Seems like something got overhyped again.
[2022-12-02 17:09:57] <%+NeurodaxHunter> do you have a video on what your settings are at?
[2022-12-02 17:09:57] <Limor69> hows the game?

[2022-12-02 17:10:08] <@%Suzunahara> @V3PSON yeah that's the one that changes how it loads textures right ^^. it's a good one, but not everyone needs to go that far
[2022-12-02 17:10:09] <JoWingy> 4090s can't even run it well on high settingsd

[2022-12-02 17:10:25] <+teknotranz> does the same issue exist on ps5?
[2022-12-02 17:10:25] <ilikebreaddoyou2> @cohhcarnage Before you leave the medical room, drop all your loot on the floor and pick up the rest.

[2022-12-02 17:11:42] <JustCallMeGabeN> Hi Cohh, loot don't seem to disappear when you drop it on the ground, have you thought about dropping it before "no way back" door which you near right now and go back to grab the loot which you left behind. Payoff if questionable compared to time spend but it's a way to get it all.

[2022-12-02 17:36:30] <@%Aghamyr> Kalbatronas mostly because a lot of people need those comparison to figure what's the game like, and it's also convenient to describe the game. The problem for me is when it because an attack of the game

[2022-12-02 17:37:06] <%BayHarborButcher> like coming into chat and declaring something is trash and a clone is the twitch viewer version of clickbaity titles. provoking and inflammatory
[2022-12-02 17:37:10] <@%Aghamyr> Saying a game is like xcom is a valid description for me, saying it's an xcom rip-off is dumb
[2022-12-02 17:37:19] <%Kalbatronas> @Aghamyr they just want to oversimplify the game and it makes things soudn so one dimensional

[2022-12-02 17:38:12] <Redwyrm> I have feeling Cohh actually might like new PoE league
[2022-12-02 17:38:18] <Lyroth> all marketing I have seen from callisto has been "The ex devs from the dead space makers that made dead space games formed another studio to make a spiritual successor to dead space that looks and plays like dead space"

[2022-12-02 17:39:02] <%Kalbatronas> ruthles mode is like Hard mode in PoE
[2022-12-02 17:39:04] <%BayHarborButcher> @Lyroth yeah even the trailers were an homage to Dead Space
[2022-12-02 17:39:06] <%Letingting> Lyroth cohhHug
[2022-12-02 17:39:10] <Redwyrm> yeah, kinda like Hades
[2022-12-02 17:39:20] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Lyroth NODDERS same marketing like Back 4 blood and left 4 dead
[2022-12-02 17:39:22] <Redwyrm> only with all other awesomeness of PoE
[2022-12-02 17:39:30] <%BayHarborButcher> I think Cohh is going to like Midnight Suns more than he expects
[2022-12-02 17:39:58] <Lyroth> And watching other streamers and reviews and stuff it seems very obvious that they rushed callisto out early to get it out before christmas and more importantly the dead space remake
[2022-12-02 17:40:09] <Redwyrm> i usualy not jumping on league after league... but this time it might be exception
[2022-12-02 17:40:31] <%BayHarborButcher> @Lyroth probably a good point. maybe they weren't aware of the Dead Space remake timing and rushed it to not compete
[2022-12-02 17:41:03] <%Kalbatronas> i do hope that the new league will be rewardign tho
[2022-12-02 17:41:06] <Redwyrm> of course there is also so much to play. New Warframe, new major ED update, i need to finish new NW playthrough

[2022-12-02 17:41:39] <BenjyyX> I am pretty disappointed by Callisto tbh. It really doesn't feel like an improvement from dead space

[2022-12-02 17:42:17] <%BayHarborButcher> @BenjyyX it kind of reminds me of The Surge 1, like there's a good concept there but kind of uninspired

[2022-12-02 17:43:55] <BenjyyX> @Tarquinius1 Besides, it was marketed, HEAVILY, i would say, that the ywanted it to be a spiritual successor

[2022-12-02 17:44:13] <Redwyrm> tbh i was kinda ok with nemesis rares in Kalandra, especialy after initial few nerfs. Otehrwise Atlas itself feels kinda... too easy

[2022-12-02 17:44:55] <%BayHarborButcher> @BenjyyX Yeah that's how I thought it would be, a spiritual successor. i expected it to be more like how Outer Worlds was to FONV.

[2022-12-02 17:46:05] <BenjyyX> @Tarquinius1 Ye, but that is sad and disappointing. I dunno, it really feels bad. And also, a personal problem that i have, is that it is not horror
[2022-12-02 17:46:25] <BenjyyX> The atmosphere is nice and all, but it doesn't touch on that dead space feeling

[2022-12-02 17:47:26] <BenjyyX> I mean, when they said they wanted to make a spiritual successor, i expected to be horror.
[2022-12-02 17:47:39] <%ninchuka> is it not kinda horror?
[2022-12-02 17:47:47] <BenjyyX> Like, the enemies are unsettling and disgusting and such
[2022-12-02 17:47:50] <%ninchuka> it seems quite scary to me
[2022-12-02 17:47:55] <BenjyyX> But they barely impress or scare
[2022-12-02 17:48:01] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> It's the same type of horror as dead space 1 in my eyes NODDERS
[2022-12-02 17:48:10] <BenjyyX> Necromorphs had that impact on you that this game doesn't touch it
[2022-12-02 17:48:13] <%ChromaticCorps3> @cdpr_lied_to_us NODDERS
[2022-12-02 17:48:37] <%BayHarborButcher> It doesn't have as much tension building and psychological horror to it, just focused more on the sci-fi and body horror. I wonder if the constant stutters and graphical distractions break that tension
[2022-12-02 17:48:39] <%Tarquinius1> More of an action game with horror elements

[2022-12-02 17:50:00] <%BayHarborButcher> I think DS1 did a better job of making you feel like around any corner there could be some horrific abomination just waiting to eat your face. callisto feels more like slow doom
[2022-12-02 17:50:17] <%BayHarborButcher> you expect monsters everywhere and are prepared for every encounter

[2022-12-02 17:50:27] <BenjyyX> LUL
[2022-12-02 17:50:49] <%ChromaticCorps3> Well hopefully the combat and monsters pick up. After all we're only 2 hours in? 3?

[2022-12-02 17:51:01] <BenjyyX> I also don't feel like the game deserves 3-4 like most people seem to give it this rating. But i don't think i could raise it higher than a 6.5
[2022-12-02 17:51:05] <%Tarquinius1> Also DS1 was new and innovative for the time- Callisto is just trying to recapture the old magic, like chasing a fart let loose with a jar
[2022-12-02 17:51:25] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 yeah i think with more combat skills and options like the force gloves it will be more fun and engaging

[2022-12-02 17:51:55] <BenjyyX> Didn't the devs say they want to implement a battlepass that sells you death animations?

[2022-12-02 17:52:09] <BenjyyX> Heard it from multiple people, and that seemed scummy as hell
[2022-12-02 17:52:14] <%BayHarborButcher> Video Game devs need to talk to the Duffer brothers. They nailed the whole "nostalgic but new" thing with Stranger Things

[2022-12-02 17:54:05] <%Tarquinius1> @BenjyyX more like there will be added DLC content that includes 13 new death animations, people someone made it like stuff was gated out and you need to buy it for full experience
[2022-12-02 17:54:05] <%Simon_Verhoeven> and it's not scummy to me, it's new animations that haven't even been captured/developed yet. Mocap isn't cheap

[2022-12-02 17:57:37] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee new stuff that gives hours of playtime
[2022-12-02 17:57:56] <%BayHarborButcher> @Aghamyr see i'm okay with that, games are way bigger and more complex and require way more production these days to meet gamers needs/desires. i guess i don't even have a problem with mtx as long as it's like a neon cyberpunk viking skin for valhallla. just make it clear that it's optional stuff and make the line between content and extras clear
[2022-12-02 17:57:57] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I mean the dlc could introduce new enemies and then new death animations. Can easily word that different and you have a click bait title cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 17:57:58] <%Spero_Mcgee> define the amount of hours cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 17:58:23] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee depends on the game
[2022-12-02 17:58:24] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Overwatch 2 skin for 20‚Ç¨ cohhBoom
[2022-12-02 17:58:41] <%Tarquinius1> Note I dont consider skins as DLC
[2022-12-02 17:58:44] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Tarquinius1 and therein lies the problem LUL
[2022-12-02 17:59:13] <BenjyyX> Isn't this game rather short tho?
[2022-12-02 17:59:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> DLC is anything thats downloadable and is content cohhK
[2022-12-02 17:59:20] <BenjyyX> 10 hours or such?
[2022-12-02 17:59:33] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee game itself is downloadable content
[2022-12-02 17:59:38] <%BayHarborButcher> @cdpr_lied_to_us see that's a good example of going too far. if you could buy a skin for 5 bucks or earn it through 20 hours of grinding in a game, fine. but OW2 set the cost wayy to high for both ingame time and real money
[2022-12-02 17:59:46] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Eh, just wait to buy it and snag the GotY version
[2022-12-02 17:59:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Tarquinius1 Now you get it cohhD
[2022-12-02 17:59:59] <%Simon_Verhoeven> isn't ow2 a couple hundred hours @BayHarborButcher ?

[2022-12-02 18:00:08] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BayHarborButcher NODDERS the learned from Diablo Immortals that some people will buy it regardless
[2022-12-02 18:00:12] <%DestroyerOfSushi> So a patch is a DLC cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:00:19] <%Mud__> @Tarquinius1 the entire game is just a giant DLC cohhGasp
[2022-12-02 18:00:26] <%BayHarborButcher> @Simon_Verhoeven i mean it's a multiplayer hero objective game, don't know if you can say it has a time limit. i've alrady sunk 200 into it just playing multiplayer
[2022-12-02 18:00:36] <%Spero_Mcgee> @DestroyerOfSushi if it adds new content then technically yes
[2022-12-02 18:00:42] <%Simon_Verhoeven> I didn't get to watch too much calisto protocol, is the performance really that bad?
[2022-12-02 18:00:58] <%Spero_Mcgee> no idea I havent watched at all cohhD
[2022-12-02 18:01:00] <%Archangelm> to see this chat you have to keep downloading the new data, therefore chat is DLC cohhSus
[2022-12-02 18:01:02] <%BayHarborButcher> @Simon_Verhoeven not if you tweak some settings, but it's not ideal for a hyped release with sponserships
[2022-12-02 18:01:10] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven its ok once you switch to DX11
[2022-12-02 18:01:22] <%Archangelm> DX11 with 69M pc is fine cohhFee
[2022-12-02 18:01:26] <%ChromaticCorps3> @simon_verhoeven Personally I say no. I think ppl are just overreacting. It's not amazing mind you, but I like it still.
[2022-12-02 18:01:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Archangelm And the quality is all over the place too
[2022-12-02 18:01:44] <%Astorma> DX11 and medium settings cohhFee
[2022-12-02 18:01:47] <%Spero_Mcgee> @ChromaticCorps3 NOT AMAZING?! THAT MEANS ITS ATROCIOUS cohhD
[2022-12-02 18:01:49] <%Archangelm> Spero_Mcgee some chats don't even have emotes cohhSus
[2022-12-02 18:01:54] <%BayHarborButcher> @Archangelm sometimes it takes a long time fore responses to load and people reply to comments wayyy later
[2022-12-02 18:01:54] <%Simon_Verhoeven> cohhL Spero_Mcgee
[2022-12-02 18:02:04] <%Simon_Verhoeven> smells like let it simmer
[2022-12-02 18:02:12] <%Archangelm> simmer down cohhBoom
[2022-12-02 18:02:18] <%Spero_Mcgee> so its  a wet smelly fart atm?
[2022-12-02 18:02:27] <%ChromaticCorps3> Archangelm where the Cohh DLC? That things need a patch for years. cohhD
[2022-12-02 18:02:29] <%Tarquinius1> Its not a wait for a sale, bur it is wait for a patch
[2022-12-02 18:02:38] <BenjyyX> @Spero_Mcgee Kinda, ye
[2022-12-02 18:02:42] <%Spero_Mcgee> Its always wait for a sale Tarq
[2022-12-02 18:02:45] <%Archangelm> ChromaticCorps3 it's shovelware im afraid FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-02 18:02:50] <%BayHarborButcher> Cohh's DLC is developing on his head and face
[2022-12-02 18:02:56] <%Spero_Mcgee> with only very few exceptions to the rule ever
[2022-12-02 18:02:59] <%Simon_Verhoeven> In all fairness I still need to play dead space 3, so that'll tide me over swell cohhLUL
[2022-12-02 18:03:17] <+Magumo> What time will Cohh be playing Midnight suns?
[2022-12-02 18:03:28] <%ChromaticCorps3> Probably an in hour I say.
[2022-12-02 18:03:36] <%+BlueSapphyre> midnight suns is so fun.
[2022-12-02 18:03:39] <+Magumo> ok. thx
[2022-12-02 18:04:00] <%BayHarborButcher> @BlueSapphyre gameplay looks good, how is the UI to play with? Feels like a mobile UI which I always hate
[2022-12-02 18:04:01] <%Archangelm> Simon_Verhoeven I don't think I ever played 3 cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:04:01] <%Astorma> Is Marvel Suns the one with Ben Brode developing it?  cohhSip
[2022-12-02 18:04:10] <%ChromaticCorps3> You get to make your own character don't you?
[2022-12-02 18:04:11] <%Astorma> Or was that Marvel Snap cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:04:18] <%Archangelm> Pokemon snap? cohhWow
[2022-12-02 18:04:21] <+Magumo> it was suns.

[2022-12-02 18:05:50] <%Archangelm> cohhMy ?
[2022-12-02 18:05:52] <%+BlueSapphyre> some people hate the writing. but i love the corny lines. like Tony refering to Strange as Doctor Spooky. i was dying.
[2022-12-02 18:06:15] <%ChromaticCorps3> How many heroes can you play as? cohhD
[2022-12-02 18:06:22] <+Magumo> One of the little factions name is an acronym for Emo kids.
[2022-12-02 18:06:33] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Marvel Humor. You love it or hate it cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 18:06:43] <%+BlueSapphyre> ^
[2022-12-02 18:07:04] <%ChromaticCorps3> But what if I love to hate it? Like a dad joke. cohhSus
[2022-12-02 18:07:18] <%BayHarborButcher> @cdpr_lied_to_us i was about to say something similar. very hit or miss. i prefer the drier humor to corny
[2022-12-02 18:07:40] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 that sounds like love with extra steps
[2022-12-02 18:07:55] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher danHmm
[2022-12-02 18:07:56] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I also dislike it very much. Hope it's not too much and can be ignored LUL
[2022-12-02 18:08:27] <%BayHarborButcher> @cdpr_lied_to_us until I was in my 20's I played entire games without noticing the plot or dialogue so I think you should be able to
[2022-12-02 18:08:49] <%ChromaticCorps3> I'm guessing no Guardians of the Galaxy? danSad
[2022-12-02 18:08:53] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Astorma snap is the brode one
[2022-12-02 18:09:13] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 GoG did a perfect job on the humor imo. it was on the drier side and snarky
[2022-12-02 18:09:27] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BayHarborButcher i will try it out NODDERS
[2022-12-02 18:09:42] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> GoGs humor was excellent imo ratJAM
[2022-12-02 18:09:50] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher Oh I ment, them being in Midnight Suns.
[2022-12-02 18:10:28] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 You inadvertently made a good point about Marvel humor though. cohhGG

[2022-12-02 18:16:21] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BayHarborButcher Ehm yes? You always sneeze into your hands if you dont have a handkerchief on hand. What are you a barbarian that sneezes into the air so that everyone can catch your cold cohhD

[2022-12-02 18:17:25] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BayHarborButcher thats a covid thing. Besides I dont think you can react quick enough to a sudden sneeze to bring it to your elbow as opposed to your hands
[2022-12-02 18:17:29] <%ninchuka> cohhO bob is nekkid

[2022-12-02 18:19:26] <%Spero_Mcgee> besides sneezing into your elbows would mean the snot sticks there
[2022-12-02 18:19:33] <%Spero_Mcgee> that would be unsanitary
[2022-12-02 18:19:54] <%BobPatience> Because people definitely wash their hands
[2022-12-02 18:20:06] <%Kalbatronas> if yuo sneze a lot bruh you clean a lot cant do one thing

[2022-12-02 18:21:09] <%BayHarborButcher> I think the actual purpose isn't just because you touch things with your hands but it blocks the sneeze mist better than your hands
[2022-12-02 18:21:24] <%ChromaticCorps3> @drchaos0 In about 30 mins.

[2022-12-02 18:36:00] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher My friends we're actually talking about that last night. There pretty mad over it. Seeing as we have the switch verison, and over 1000 hours in. There's no cross progress or save. cohhBongos Personally I'm just happy others can play it now.
[2022-12-02 18:36:11] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven not my favorite one but im diffrent, my favorites are the 11th then the 12th and then actually the 13th, but the story of the 13th was pretty shit but man, she was a GREAT doctor
[2022-12-02 18:36:13] <%williamwall512> Wait Disney is doing Doctor Who?

[2022-12-02 18:36:55] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki I liked her as an actor, but her story was likely the worst since the reboot.

[2022-12-02 18:38:14] <%williamwall512> Crunchyroll
[2022-12-02 18:38:16] <%+BlueSapphyre> @williamwall512 end of october, i want to say.
[2022-12-02 18:38:18] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @williamwall512 crunchy roll is basically empty here
[2022-12-02 18:38:25] <%konataizumi1982> From what Ive read they dont really own dr who, its a distribution deal with overseas streaming
[2022-12-02 18:38:38] <%Kalbatronas> @Kalbatronas i couldent even watch enythign its almosut as if 480 is max sometimes... and i got it for the new Bleach anime to
[2022-12-02 18:38:42] <%ChromaticCorps3> I starting watching during the 11th Doctor. Good times. cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 18:38:56] <%BayHarborButcher> @Kalbatronas works well here and it actually has a LOT to offer for content between marvel, SW, and their stuff
[2022-12-02 18:38:58] <%williamwall512> ahh so like their deal with Studio Ghibli
[2022-12-02 18:38:58] <%ImaginationToForm> ive watched from b&w doctor
[2022-12-02 18:39:05] <%Simon_Verhoeven> A shame they never did anything with his somewhat twin @ChromaticCorps3
[2022-12-02 18:39:10] <%+nediane> apparently it's also funding, which makes people wonder how much creative control they'll have
[2022-12-02 18:39:13] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven whats your favorite character of the show that isnt the doctor? mine is the 1000 year old roman soldier, of how old he was again
[2022-12-02 18:39:18] <%+BlueSapphyre> 10th doctor is best doctor.
[2022-12-02 18:39:18] <%Kalbatronas> @Kalbatronas gues its region based a lot nto Bleach and the quality sucks
[2022-12-02 18:39:24] <%MrZanki> i like the title of him so im using it
[2022-12-02 18:39:32] <%BayHarborButcher> I forget his name but the the guy before David Tenant was my first doctor, but Tenant will always be The Doctor in my mind
[2022-12-02 18:39:39] <%ChromaticCorps3> Ohhhh the Final Season of Bleach, is good. Much better then the manga so far. cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 18:39:42] <%+nediane> ChromaticCorps3 Nine was my first, although my dad watched the old ones rerunning on PBS when I was a kid, so some of the original stuff was in my head
[2022-12-02 18:39:42] <%williamwall512> I want to watch b&w who but I don't want to pay for an additional service to watch it
[2022-12-02 18:39:47] <%+arkhitekton14> Did Cohh say when he will be back for Midnight Suns?
[2022-12-02 18:39:53] <%+nediane> BayHarborButcher Chris Eccleston was Nine
[2022-12-02 18:40:02] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I only watched the David Tennant Doctor Who. Didn't know that they change actors so often and was pretty sad cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 18:40:15] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki rooThink our roman soldier is likely my favourite, he got the bad deal so often and still did such outstanding things
[2022-12-02 18:40:17] <%ImaginationToForm> Tom Baker still one of the best doctors :)
[2022-12-02 18:40:25] <%+arkhitekton14> @BayHarborButcher Eccleston. I like him as well, but Tennant's my fav
[2022-12-02 18:40:29] <%Simon_Verhoeven> I want to watch the B&W, but getting the episodes is so expensive.
[2022-12-02 18:40:30] <darkwolfn1> @cdpr_lied_to_us Tennant best Doctor. so you are good
[2022-12-02 18:40:32] <%williamwall512> @cdpr_lied_to_us well I have some good news for you
[2022-12-02 18:40:45] <%ChromaticCorps3> Cohh will be back pretty soon. Hopefully by 1.
[2022-12-02 18:40:45] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven and the hero got the girl at last, and a child, and a... granddauther? i think
[2022-12-02 18:40:45] <%+nediane> Tennant good, but not best
[2022-12-02 18:40:47] <%+BlueSapphyre> @cdpr_lied_to_us he's coming back baby!
[2022-12-02 18:40:48] <%BayHarborButcher> @nediane yeah that's the one, i liked him in 28 Days Later and that's actually why I started watching
[2022-12-02 18:41:02] <%Kalbatronas> the 9 and 10 dcotros were awesome but got stale after that cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:41:09] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> He will play doctor who again or just a cameo or that stuff?
[2022-12-02 18:41:19] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> darkwolfn1 cohhPat
[2022-12-02 18:41:20] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki not a granddaughter afaik
[2022-12-02 18:41:23] <%BayHarborButcher> @cdpr_lied_to_us He also seems to be the successor for David Attenborough's BBC documentaries, they use him for a voiceover for the last few
[2022-12-02 18:41:25] <%ChromaticCorps3> Oh how was the woman doctor btw? I missed all that.
[2022-12-02 18:41:31] <%williamwall512> He is playing the doctor for the next year
[2022-12-02 18:41:35] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @cdpr_lied_to_us it will be special
[2022-12-02 18:41:38] <%+arkhitekton14> @cdpr_lied_to_us I think he's the doctor for the next few specials until he is replaced by Ncuti
[2022-12-02 18:41:46] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 a lot of people said her story wasn't the best but she was great as the doctor
[2022-12-02 18:41:47] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven well doctor had a daughter... but thats all i remember ^^ thats why i said "i think" so she wasnt from river?
[2022-12-02 18:41:47] <%+nediane> I love the actress, but she got stuck with some awful storylines ChromaticCorps3
[2022-12-02 18:41:48] <%+BlueSapphyre> @ChromaticCorps3 she was very good. maybe my 3rd/4th favourite doctor.
[2022-12-02 18:41:49] <%williamwall512> @chromaticcorps3 terrible
[2022-12-02 18:41:49] <%ImaginationToForm> I didnt care for her
[2022-12-02 18:41:57] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Nice! Maybe i will look at it. Thanks Chat! cohhL
[2022-12-02 18:42:07] <%BayHarborButcher> @williamwall512 what's B&W?
[2022-12-02 18:42:10] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @ChromaticCorps3 superb actress, bad story
[2022-12-02 18:42:16] <darkwolfn1> She was a good docotr. the writting though
[2022-12-02 18:42:18] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BayHarborButcher cohhO he has a very nice voice
[2022-12-02 18:42:29] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki no
[2022-12-02 18:42:30] <%williamwall512> Black & white
[2022-12-02 18:42:35] <%Kalbatronas> seems female cast get qute meh casts... cohhStare
[2022-12-02 18:42:49] <%williamwall512> The show began before color
[2022-12-02 18:42:54] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @darkwolfn1 Rowan Atkinson wasn't your favourite actor?
[2022-12-02 18:42:55] <%+BlueSapphyre> @darkwolfn1 yeah, i agree with this. she was a good doctor, but the season wasn't written well.
[2022-12-02 18:43:24] <%ChromaticCorps3> So we're on 14th or 15th Doctor now? cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:43:38] <%+nediane> FYI, if you liked Eccleston/Nine, Big Finish and BBC brought him back for a run of audio stories
[2022-12-02 18:43:41] <%williamwall512> 14th
[2022-12-02 18:44:13] <%Simon_Verhoeven> 16th
[2022-12-02 18:44:19] <%Kalbatronas> oh yeh are they still doing the blue telethone mashine thing cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:44:21] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> 18th
[2022-12-02 18:44:23] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Jodie Whittaker was the 13th
[2022-12-02 18:44:27] <%Simon_Verhoeven> 15th*
[2022-12-02 18:44:34] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> 22th
[2022-12-02 18:44:45] <%williamwall512> numerical 14th but yes we have war doctor
[2022-12-02 18:45:00] <%ImaginationToForm> when a good man goes to war...
[2022-12-02 18:45:00] <@%^CohhilitionBot> Cohh has joined with IBuyPower (again!) to bring you a great deal on your pre-built PCs! cohhCheer Check out Cohh.tv/IBuyPower (and use code "COHHCARNAGE" to save some money) for more details and specs cohhGG Thanks everyone! cohhGV
[2022-12-02 18:45:01] <%+nediane> yeah war doctor messes up the count
[2022-12-02 18:45:04] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @williamwall512 and 2 (well soon three) tenant doctors
[2022-12-02 18:45:19] <%williamwall512> yeah double tenant
[2022-12-02 18:45:22] <%ChromaticCorps3> Omg they finally showed the War Doctor!?
[2022-12-02 18:45:24] <%Simon_Verhoeven> so we technically have 17 doctors. Jodie was the 15th, then we saw the sixteenth and seventeenth
[2022-12-02 18:45:29] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Double Tennant cohhMy
[2022-12-02 18:45:34] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @ChromaticCorps3 we saw him three or four years ago (john hurt)
[2022-12-02 18:45:40] <%LuLoc> cohhSip
[2022-12-02 18:45:40] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 yeah and it's John Hurt!
[2022-12-02 18:45:47] <%ChromaticCorps3> I only remembered him in the book.
[2022-12-02 18:45:49] <%ImaginationToForm> who knew...
[2022-12-02 18:45:57] <%ChromaticCorps3> cohhCheer
[2022-12-02 18:46:13] <%BayHarborButcher> there are Dr. Who books?! No. I just started getting into WH40k books, can't start another universe
[2022-12-02 18:46:16] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Didn't know there are so many Doctor Who fans in Cohhs community cohhSip
[2022-12-02 18:46:17] <%+nediane> I really should look up why Tennant returned/is returning, I honestly just didn't care enough to find out before
[2022-12-02 18:46:21] <%cemei> I made my late bestie whovian, and I still remember her calling me after watching "Blink" LUL
[2022-12-02 18:46:25] <%williamwall512> no capaldi was 12 and Jodie was 13
[2022-12-02 18:46:28] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BayHarborButcher a lot, and also comics and audio books
[2022-12-02 18:46:33] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher Oh god yes.
[2022-12-02 18:46:36] <%+nediane> BayHarborButcher cohhLUL oh, welcome to the extended universe
[2022-12-02 18:46:41] <%williamwall512> this is 14th main number
[2022-12-02 18:46:47] <%BayHarborButcher> @cdpr_lied_to_us always safe to assume in any group of more than 3 people there are Who Fans hidden amongst them
[2022-12-02 18:46:59] <%ImaginationToForm> dr who?
[2022-12-02 18:47:12] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher Funny. I just stated reading WARHAMMER 40k also. cohhLUL

[2022-12-02 18:47:24] <%+nediane> cemei a good one to intro folks through just to get a taste, even if it's not a normal episode
[2022-12-02 18:47:27] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BayHarborButcher true KEKW
[2022-12-02 18:47:29] <%Tuskaton> cohhLick Kalbatronas
[2022-12-02 18:47:34] <%ChromaticCorps3> @bayharborbutcher Crimson Fists.
[2022-12-02 18:47:38] <%BayHarborButcher> @Kalbatronas as discussed earlier there are wrong opinions :)
[2022-12-02 18:47:43] <%Beuwolfs> Cohh coming back later or done for the day ?? cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:47:43] <%Kalbatronas> cohhLick @Tuskaton
[2022-12-02 18:47:57] <%ImaginationToForm> coming back Beuwolfs
[2022-12-02 18:48:05] <%williamwall512> 13 minutes to Midnight Sun #ad stream
[2022-12-02 18:48:09] <%BayHarborButcher> @ChromaticCorps3 oo that's next for me, i'm on the Eisenhorn omnibus
[2022-12-02 18:48:20] <%Kalbatronas> @Kalbatronas i mean am i a fan if dotn care bout doctor who now but i loved the previos doctors cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 18:48:22] <%Beuwolfs> ImaginationToForm Gotcha ! Thanks ! cohhBoop
[2022-12-02 18:48:27] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven but wasnt the 12th doctor called the 12th? so shouldnt it be 14th?
[2022-12-02 18:48:41] <%MrZanki> technically 10th again
[2022-12-02 18:48:50] <%+nediane> does anyone know how Midnight Suns is? Actually any good? Or should I go catch up with Callisto?
[2022-12-02 18:48:53] <%williamwall512> Yes it is and press is calling Tenant the 14th
[2022-12-02 18:48:58] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @williamwall512 depends on how you count. Up until the 8th it's easy. Then war doctor, 9th (eccleston), 10th 1.0, 10th handy (12), 11th (matt smith, 13), capaldi - 12 - 14, whittaker 13 - 15, tennant 3.0 - 10th - 16, the new one 17 th - fifteenth doctor - Ncuti Gatwa @MrZanki
[2022-12-02 18:49:09] <%ChromaticCorps3> @That's my Third. After I read this one, I'm gonna read Fabius Bile.
[2022-12-02 18:49:11] <%MrZanki> i dont count i go by the show
[2022-12-02 18:49:25] <%MrZanki> so for me its 14th / 10th again
[2022-12-02 18:49:28] <%BayHarborButcher> @nediane it's supposed to be quite good. Slay the Spire meets X-Com.  Gameplay is fun, dialogue and writing are typical Marvel seems to be the concensus
[2022-12-02 18:49:52] <%williamwall512> @nediane you can watch it with Cohh soon
[2022-12-02 18:50:06] <%MrZanki> i miss the 11th doctor, he is my favorite, but in the sense of the actor, i like him very much
[2022-12-02 18:50:21] <%ninchuka> !quote
[2022-12-02 18:50:21] <@%^CohhilitionBot> " what.... I am sure there will be a new command soon called FAIL and it will respond with "pal_me was here" " - pal_me
[2022-12-02 18:50:37] <%BayHarborButcher> I can't stand Matt Smith in House of Dragons.  Everytime I look at him: "That's the Doctor"
[2022-12-02 18:50:46] <%+nediane> BayHarborButcher huh, okay
[2022-12-02 18:50:53] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki watch the devil's hour, Capaldi is superb in it.
[2022-12-02 18:50:59] <%Simon_Verhoeven> whoops wrong doctor
[2022-12-02 18:51:05] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven i still don't know his name, was it ever said? it wasnt, was it?
[2022-12-02 18:51:14] <%+nediane> Matt Smith was 11
[2022-12-02 18:51:20] <%MrZanki> roman soldier is 11th ^^
[2022-12-02 18:51:23] <%Simon_Verhoeven> indeed, mixed them up Nediane
[2022-12-02 18:51:24] <%MrZanki> this story
[2022-12-02 18:51:33] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven i dont even know one name so u good
[2022-12-02 18:51:38] <%+nediane> and Capaldi is awesome in everything he just got handed a load of crap to deliver
[2022-12-02 18:51:41] <slobber90> where is the dingus??
[2022-12-02 18:51:50] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @MrZanki whose name, feel free to whisper me.
[2022-12-02 18:51:56] <%MrZanki> Capaldi is wich one?
[2022-12-02 18:52:10] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven the doctors, i know river song knows it but do we? the audence?
[2022-12-02 18:52:32] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Well we learned one more, but not his true name AFAIK
[2022-12-02 18:52:35] <%MrZanki> @slobber90 wich dingus? im one
[2022-12-02 18:52:47] <%MrZanki> im talking about is true name
[2022-12-02 18:52:48] <%williamwall512> I liked Capaldi and I actually enjoyed the Clara storyline
[2022-12-02 18:52:52] <%MrZanki> i bet its greg
[2022-12-02 18:52:53] <%KVahlman> How did Cohh manage with the #stutterstruggle in Callisto?
[2022-12-02 18:53:02] <slobber90> The Cohh dingus
[2022-12-02 18:53:04] <%+nediane> MrZanki Capaldi was 12, the Scottish one
[2022-12-02 18:53:12] <%Kerenceious> RareLetho ?
[2022-12-02 18:53:16] <@%Suzunahara> @KVahlman After some settings adjustment it was fine for him ^^
[2022-12-02 18:53:21] <%+pedroalmeida77> @KVahlman he set to dx11 and capped at 60  fps
[2022-12-02 18:53:28] <%MrZanki> they are all the scottish ones XD but yeath the 12th is my second favorite after the 11th
[2022-12-02 18:53:34] <%+nediane> and if you want vintage Capaldi, watch The Thick of It
[2022-12-02 18:53:39] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Do we know how long the midnight stream is? cohhSip
[2022-12-02 18:53:53] <%KVahlman> Well, the #stutterstruggle issues have nothing to do with those but good if he wasn't too bothered
[2022-12-02 18:53:59] <%+nediane> a stray Suzunahara cohhWow cohhL
[2022-12-02 18:54:06] <@%Suzunahara> !callistosettings @KVahlman
[2022-12-02 18:54:07] <@%^CohhilitionBot> KVahlman Some people playing The Callisto Protocol on PC have been having issues with the game stuttering; if you are experiencing this try capping the FPS to 60, switching to DX11, and turning off Motion Blur. cohhHmm If you are still having issues pop over here to try some other fixes: Cohh.tv/CallistoSettings cohhNotes
[2022-12-02 18:54:10] <%MrZanki> and the 13th felt like the 11th in female form so she is my third favorite (again, her storys still sucked, but she was amaaaaaazing)
[2022-12-02 18:54:13] <@%Suzunahara> @nediane hey hey cohhL cohhHug
[2022-12-02 18:54:23] <%Ophelos> The Title
[2022-12-02 18:54:29] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven i know what the problem with her story is, i just noticed
[2022-12-02 18:54:43] <%MrZanki> @Simon_Verhoeven her storys felt like "well we ran out of budget but have 1 more season to go"
[2022-12-02 18:54:56] <%ninchuka> KVahlman unless it gets worse like how the stuttering in eldren ring was, I would be able to cope with it just fine personally, sure its annoying but not the end of the world from what I saw watching cohh
[2022-12-02 18:54:56] <%Houze968> There's a weird-ass show that Capaldi is in on Prime Video called "The Devil's Hour".... he's excellent in the role
[2022-12-02 18:55:00] <%KVahlman> Too bad he is headed for another game with issues, but maybe this time his rig saves him
[2022-12-02 18:55:29] <%+Polywhirl61> whens he come backkk
[2022-12-02 18:55:30] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Houze968 cohhLUL I've been advertising it for the past 30 minutes, planning to watch the last episode this weekend

[2022-12-02 19:15:12] <hallrock> is this like guardians somewhat or better?
[2022-12-02 19:15:18] <Thbigchief> Every company should branch out, but Firaxis is definitely preying on Xcom fans to buy this and its not quite honest
[2022-12-02 19:15:20] <@%Suzunahara> @woopdaritis they do this intentionally. So people don't think the games are part of the MCU, because they're not
[2022-12-02 19:15:25] <HerrSchnuff> Sicc gameplay
[2022-12-02 19:15:27] <yourfriendhuffy> chat you gotta chill a bit, this is a sponsor and chat's attitude will reflect badly on Cohh

[2022-12-02 19:17:01] <sarqon> you can only move once, in a straight line and it resets your card draw

[2022-12-02 19:17:19] <+risdell> hope the pace picks up, card games are typically faster pace than this. Worried the animations might get redundant and make the combats longer than they should, but it does look good aesthetically
[2022-12-02 19:17:20] <+Frendo_3> God people are so negative, dear lord lol 5 minutes into the game and people are screaming

[2022-12-02 19:21:38] <+prfella> @country_justice this is a squad based tactical game. The abilities are in the form of cards but thats it, therey are still treated as abilities, and you can upgrade them, get new ones, etc,

[2022-12-02 19:23:18] <+Arrican> @GamrGrll I think Damage Inc. actually deals with high premiums.  I figure between avengers towers and the sanctorum you'd be looking at a monthly payment of like $250k lol

[2022-12-02 20:07:04] <%markatron2k> man, we could see a Blade VS Venom in cinemas someday
[2022-12-02 20:07:05] <Nardap> i think that boss is supposed to knock the heroes down..at least one of them...

[2022-12-02 20:15:13] <%DanVelly> @UriellOWA 1. a game about desperate rebels with limited ressources on the run trying to survive and fight doesn't fit to a game about well trained/ equipped heroes fighting imho, 2. Firaxis themselves promoted this as a "tactical RPG", not that it would be an alternate XCOM :P

[2022-12-02 20:49:46] <SeliaRavenloft> I'm pretty sure she got her superpowers later in life, so she was just a normal person, if I recall
[2022-12-02 20:49:47] <SuperDuck74300> Ass rbzFlirty
[2022-12-02 20:49:47] <Nardap> she is just one of the most powerful superheroes around there
[2022-12-02 20:49:48] <%bloodkestrel> Ciri deserves all the pets
[2022-12-02 20:49:49] <+stephane3012> can she not lift planes? what's the point of training with normal dumbells?
[2022-12-02 20:49:50] <%+sam67784> apparently has large things in her butt
[2022-12-02 20:49:53] <darkwingdook> that's like that girl in house of ash
[2022-12-02 20:49:53] <+Drolheim> @CohhCarnage do you want her movie origin story or her comic origin story
[2022-12-02 20:49:54] <%Darnitz> she fires beams out her fists /  think Rogue from 90'
[2022-12-02 20:49:55] <dkchappy> @AmbientQ ehh shes kinda of a jerk in the comics
[2022-12-02 20:49:55] <grandlurker> captain marvel was test pilot that got affected by an infinity stone
[2022-12-02 20:49:56] <+AscalonMH> @TheNiceTeapot I agree 100% I miss brokn and beaten Carol that had to earn her palce

[2022-12-02 20:49:57] <LuxyDoodle> @CohhCarnage She's effectively Marvel's Superman
[2022-12-02 20:49:58] <LightupDarkness> Brie ruined captain marvel for me
[2022-12-02 20:49:59] <Nardap> but maybe this is her less powerful version
[2022-12-02 20:49:59] <%FluorescentPickle> @CohhCarnage captain marvel is OP AF even for a super hero... she could take the all team single handedly and then solve the problem with one hand behaind her back. some fans actually have a problem with her lore wise :P

[2022-12-02 20:50:05] <%johnthegg> @stephane3012 you can't really lift planes unless you're ont he ground, don't let the superman movies fool you
[2022-12-02 20:50:05] <%Sharitan> Is that the hairstyle @CohhCarnage is going for?

[2022-12-02 21:09:02] <Susfi> @CohhCarnage it's the name of her Super Saiyan mode: she goes Binary -> she's super strong

[2022-12-02 21:09:07] <$DrewsBlank> @CohhCarnage - Some have moved objects hitting opponents 3 times in a turn.  Not sure if this is what you were looking at...
[2022-12-02 21:09:12] <+MogwaiSalad> @CohhCarnage Binary is her glowey form that has increased damage and armor.  It wears off once her armor is broken.

[2022-12-02 21:24:04] <%Rolishot> She is basic the sorcerer from the old D&D cartoon
[2022-12-02 21:24:11] <%stacker27> cat
[2022-12-02 21:24:11] <+kawachipto> just add a number in front of everything and increment by one

[2022-12-02 21:24:17] <Tigsar> Didn't she say she was Lilith's daughter? That's pretty much a definition of a demon in Marvel.
[2022-12-02 21:24:18] <+AriaOfValor> that seems like a good reason to become a polyglot
[2022-12-02 21:24:19] <%+Mazzyxpa> Runaways is a good comic
[2022-12-02 21:24:22] <+koffern> how many bottles of shampoo do you need to maintain that hair? rooDerp

[2022-12-02 21:24:33] <%Moewenfels> How does this work? Is "Throw a fireball at 500¬∞C" different from "Throw a fireball at 501¬∞C?"
[2022-12-02 21:24:33] <%bloodkestrel> and plot
[2022-12-02 21:24:34] <%+Gaminggumper> @mazzyxpa Agreed

[2022-12-02 21:31:30] <chaselightspeed> I don't think it's 'evil'
[2022-12-02 21:31:30] <%TenshiOtonashi> Could always just go Neutral

[2022-12-02 21:31:36] <Viktor616> I don't think Dark means Evil

[2022-12-02 21:31:40] <%+Bread_Assassin> Dark isn't always evil, Cohh.

[2022-12-02 21:31:49] <grandlurker> Cohn don't worry as long as you use both dark and light cards
[2022-12-02 21:31:49] <+youngest_bboomer> Dark is Dark. Not Evil
[2022-12-02 21:31:50] <+Wildcard273> I think this game is going to end up being about the battle between leave in or rinse out conditioner.
[2022-12-02 21:31:50] <+InAVan> the fabio hair is killing me
[2022-12-02 21:31:51] <%DanVelly> @CohhCarnage maybe think of it more like a school of magic you follow cohhHmm

[2022-12-02 21:31:55] <MetaHatter> Dark just means more Nico dates
[2022-12-02 21:31:56] <%+Odin_Alfadr> Dark is not evil if your a sociopath!
[2022-12-02 21:31:58] <%noodle_dial> It just means more Cookies

[2022-12-02 21:40:06] <@%^CohhilitionBot> Yes! cohhCheer As an ARPG RogueLite, this game is similar to Hades! cohhGG It IS however, doing lots of things to differentiate itself from other games of its type (like Hades) cohhGG If you DO like Hades, think of this game as an alternate take on the mechanics without as much story. cohhHug
[2022-12-02 21:40:07] <+DartUK> Have you had problem with stuttering @CohhCarnage
[2022-12-02 21:40:08] <Niriall> Its like 3d slay the spire

[2022-12-02 21:40:24] <Oboreten> you saw "Werewolf by Night" Cohh?  soo much lore fromMarvel horror in that, esp concerning the Hunterss
[2022-12-02 21:40:26] <%+seraphim0352> This still feels a bit like a Marvel mobile game
[2022-12-02 21:40:26] <friegolit> Fire Emblem, perhaps?
[2022-12-02 21:40:26] <graycap111b> why is there so much oomph in the impacts for a turn-based game?
[2022-12-02 21:40:26] <%TheNupsyWord> that ciri?
[2022-12-02 21:40:26] <SeliaRavenloft> It's closer to a turn-based dungeon crawler in terms of positioning than xcom
[2022-12-02 21:40:27] <%00oniking00> its hades clone
[2022-12-02 21:40:28] <doraneko89> NODDERS so basically Hades

[2022-12-02 21:40:34] <+App1e_Jakes> It looks like Divinity Original Sin with cards.
[2022-12-02 21:40:34] <%+Odin_Alfadr> But its marvel and tactical combat.... marvel xcom obvi
[2022-12-02 21:40:34] <%DanVelly> @CohhCarnage it's "Marvel by the XCOM devs" ... many people just forgets the words in between cohhT

[2022-12-02 21:40:44] <Astronimal> If it's like Xcom, it's most similar to Xcom: Chimera Squad
[2022-12-02 21:40:50] <+pimplordmofo> Are we getting technical now? Kappa
[2022-12-02 21:40:54] <%+CharleyCoug> that hair tho

[2022-12-02 21:40:55] <SeliaRavenloft> I mean, bringing multiple seperate ideas together is still a new idea in and of itself

[2022-12-02 21:41:07] <%bloodkestrel> cannot be Xcom: no one has been killed in full cover, and the team can actually hit things at ranges of more than point blank...
[2022-12-02 21:41:09] <Samurai0115> is that a custom character, or is that glorious hair default?
[2022-12-02 21:41:10] <%+Teiwaz85> this is hades. like every other game
[2022-12-02 21:41:11] <%Kerenceious> @DanVelly So what you're saying is "marvel xcom" Kappa

[2022-12-02 21:41:19] <%PervySages> it feels like what if you turned warhammer 40k into a card game

[2022-12-02 21:41:26] <GingervitusGaming> I like how many people are saying this looks like xcom, because turn based strategy = xcom.  I guess Final Fantasy Tactics is like xcom

[2022-12-02 22:04:19] <+Javonthalas> is the hair, cohh's real life goal?
[2022-12-02 22:04:21] <TommyEV> you have to love how the legs don't correspond to the movement speed

[2022-12-02 22:04:36] <cyber2DG> This game gives me a lot of Mass Effect 1 vibes.
[2022-12-02 22:04:36] <%+Bisontastic> @CohhCarnage it looks like your characters super hero name should be ManGirl the Shampoo Avenger
[2022-12-02 22:04:37] <+Hamsteraxe> Rocking that Kratos Beard
[2022-12-02 22:04:43] <%+Odin_Alfadr> When will Deadpool pop up? This will not be a real Marvel game without it

[2022-12-02 22:04:47] <%+Average5Head> I think the only thing that would make this better is if his character was bald and his beard looked that hair LUL

[2022-12-02 22:04:50] <SKDubz> was another tarrot card near the wind rod location

[2022-12-02 22:05:09] <%undoubtedness> dominoes power is luck or chance
[2022-12-02 22:05:11] <PistachioIV> This looks like one of those cheap Unreal engine "games" that people make quickly stiching assets LUL
[2022-12-02 22:05:16] <%bloodkestrel> I would think that Deadpool was the Tower: nothing but destrustion all around....

[2022-12-02 22:05:22] <@%Suzunahara> @crowcompany not really, no. it is turn based, but not really FF10 style. It's more like FFX-2 I suppose. Just with cards
[2022-12-02 22:05:22] <Astronimal> Still find it weird how Morbius is a DLC character, considering he is part of the OG Midnight Suns team
[2022-12-02 22:05:25] <%Koori_89> @CohhCarnage don't miss the chest
[2022-12-02 22:05:25] <+silentsniper10> oh cool that Cohh created a character that looks just like him
[2022-12-02 22:05:26] <MasqureMan> deadpool, storm, morbius, and moon knight i think

[2022-12-02 22:10:52] <+acidonion> How is the combat in this game?
[2022-12-02 22:10:52] <Falconzin> beauty hair, which shampoo? ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-02 22:10:53] <VipMalis> surprised inflation hasn't increased game prices over last 20years, but i guess its off set by growing number of gamers
[2022-12-02 22:10:54] <Gimicker> 60 hours of gameplay, I'd buy this. 60 hours of this dialog, I'll pass
[2022-12-02 22:10:54] <@%Suzunahara> @LeneMarie that does look a bit like a Ciri ^^
[2022-12-02 22:10:56] <inquisitorgm> @Reductive_Reasoning i mean... no combat ? only exploring until now.

[2022-12-02 22:11:16] <+nuttnspecial> @acidonion combat is really good turn based, just a ton of story/dialogue
[2022-12-02 22:11:23] <@%Suzunahara> @zuzz4 it's a turn based tactics/strategy game with some adventuring when you're in the Abbey
[2022-12-02 22:11:25] <%LeneMarie> @Suzunahara Evening sweetie =) She has such beautiful drawings in her fur =)
[2022-12-02 22:11:27] <%+Crazzyjimmy> @GGuts Yeah, there are a TON of games that just copy the Souls game mechanics...."Souls-Like" is a game term now.

[2022-12-02 22:11:44] <RingOfFire103> @Reductive_Reasoning that's cause cohh wants to explore, players could totally just rush to combat if they want
[2022-12-02 22:11:45] <BendenWeyrARM> Wanda's cave?
[2022-12-02 22:11:45] <PistachioIV> And the interface is a total ripoff from Elder Scrolls Online LUL LUL
[2022-12-02 22:11:46] <+maleblackfiora> i think this dialog is very immersive with other characters maybe its just me
[2022-12-02 22:11:46] <+acidonion> thanks guys. I love turnbased strat so curious to see it :)
[2022-12-02 22:11:46] <%Guomi> If you know how modern Persona works, I would use that analogy

[2022-12-02 22:12:11] <SleiFever> @DarmanORC And that's what they hope for. "Popular person in game/movie? Good enough for me"
[2022-12-02 22:12:15] <+reformed_au> For the record this costs more than the witcher 3 did when adjust for inflation. XD
[2022-12-02 22:12:15] <+ghost_t_17> use spell at grave
[2022-12-02 22:12:18] <goredoh_> This is Marvel?

[2022-12-02 22:13:15] <%Guomi> But if Callisto runs like garbage, it has visible effects on gameplay
[2022-12-02 22:13:15] <Beutimus> At least the game marks where the chests are.

[2022-12-02 22:32:47] <%+reformed_au> the game just looks so good in battles and so bad outside...like two different teams developed each ha;f. Its bizzare.
[2022-12-02 22:32:48] <+rlukemiller321> is this a deck building game?
[2022-12-02 22:32:48] <The_Bdon> That hair is on Fire! And it will not pass anytime soon.
[2022-12-02 22:32:48] <%DarmanORC> Omegaoracle cohhHug
[2022-12-02 22:32:51] <@%Suzunahara> @bigdog_x very slightly, but it's not really meant to be XCOM

[2022-12-02 22:32:55] <%+Skullking12993> @cohhcarnage  realizing that they are 2 completely different games but if you had to choose between callisto Protocol and midnight Sun's which would you choose are you enjoying one more than the other?
[2022-12-02 22:32:58] <zuzz4> Woah, it's a card game strategy, way off my tastes. Damn
[2022-12-02 22:32:58] <@%Suzunahara> @rlukemiller321 a bit, yes ^^
[2022-12-02 22:33:09] <@%nuuriell> Shoya02 He's enjoying it and is playing more tomorrow.

[2022-12-02 22:33:30] <NotToast> Ew, this is a card game?
[2022-12-02 22:33:31] <%Captainkingdog> @RagnaroKPrimeTV You're created character just for this game.
[2022-12-02 22:33:34] <+youngest_bboomer> is it aoe?
[2022-12-02 22:33:36] <@%Aghamyr> Shoya02 he's only played a few hours, he'd need to finish it before saying he recommends it or not, but he's been enjoying it
[2022-12-02 22:33:40] <+waterbearsonmars> Since this is based off the 90s comic, they should be using metal fight music
[2022-12-02 22:33:41] <+mighty167> wait what... this is a card game?
[2022-12-02 22:33:45] <%Leviathan7584> there's a photo mode?! quick Cohh get some headshots of Hunter
[2022-12-02 22:33:51] <Gimicker> does he have cards that benefit from his low life?
[2022-12-02 22:33:54] <+xii_ACE_iix> it's more like Metal Gear Ac!d
[2022-12-02 22:33:58] <%Koori_89> @CohhCarnage you should read the hero biuo and perks

[2022-12-02 22:34:01] <+Qwii_> are the cards random? or are you collecting and building a "deck" so-to-speak?
[2022-12-02 22:34:03] <%+frezq90> nice! its a card game
[2022-12-02 22:34:05] <%Koori_89> bio

[2022-12-02 22:36:28] <%+Crazzyjimmy> @ddubs730 it is a tactics RPG using card mechanics. It is made by Firaxis, but it is not like XCOM.

[2022-12-02 23:10:55] <%Spero_Mcgee> Anyone in chat that has used Static Strike before?

[2022-12-02 23:13:47] <%somefin> Oh interesting. I completely forgot about PoE this league
[2022-12-02 23:13:49] <%Spero_Mcgee> Negative reviews are always obsolete if you enjoy the game
[2022-12-02 23:14:21] <%Spero_Mcgee> they might be informative but usually not something you wont notice yourself
[2022-12-02 23:14:38] <%Spero_Mcgee> something like stuttering is probably more common on lower end PCs Id assume

[2022-12-02 23:16:35] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Astorma For most streamers I doubt they have as much issues as everyone else, since their PCs could most likely brute force through a lot of it

[2022-12-02 23:18:06] <%Spero_Mcgee> But yeah I asked about Static Strike specificly , but I guess it would work with any strike skill > It now has "Melee Strike Skills deal Splash Damage to surrounding targets".
[2022-12-02 23:18:27] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee well the main problem cant really be brute-forced as its just bugged
[2022-12-02 23:18:29] <%DanVelly> @Spero_Mcgee tbh, I only tried it once, but Static Strike doesn't really use target additional nearby enemy anyway
[2022-12-02 23:18:56] <%DanVelly> @Spero_Mcgee what kills enemies with it are the sparks you release from the buff you gain from hitting a single enemy cohhHmm
[2022-12-02 23:19:05] <%Astorma> I remember how Divinity 2 (not DOS2) had a serious microstuttering issue for me. It was so weird. While panning the camera my character would be animating smoothly but the everything else would be stuttering. Gamebryo cohhOld
[2022-12-02 23:20:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Tarquinius1 Indeed. I was mostly refering to minor/major optimisation issues
[2022-12-02 23:21:34] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Spero_Mcgee Yeah but a common complaint from 4 years ago on reddit was for example that with a strike skill such as Static Strike, you had to use melee splash/ancestral call or else it felt really clunky. But then using those supports would lower the damage value
[2022-12-02 23:22:14] <%Vosy1984> rule #01 don't read reddit

[2022-12-02 23:22:33] <%Spero_Mcgee> In particular I want to use Static Strike again as a means to generate fortify/rage and also poison with it through https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Volkuur%27s_Guidance_(Lightning)
[2022-12-02 23:22:40] <%DanVelly> @Spero_Mcgee the skill was different 4 years ago... iirc you were able to stack the buff for it multiple times and the more stacks you had, the faster it released beams... afaik, now the buff does not stack anymore -> no real need to hit multiple enemies
[2022-12-02 23:22:44] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 that doesnt apply to the PoE reddit

[2022-12-02 23:25:54] <%Spero_Mcgee> @DanVelly Makes sense. Its not so much about the stacking though. Its just when you use it as a main skill, its handy that the damage from the initial hit splashes around, aside from the beams shooting out as well
[2022-12-02 23:26:11] <%DanVelly> @ChromaticCorps3 yes. Both sponsored and not sponsored, he claimed
[2022-12-02 23:26:31] <%Astorma> Oh noes
[2022-12-02 23:26:39] <%Spero_Mcgee> @DanVelly When they added ancestral call support for example that was a godsend for me when I played around with dominating blow
[2022-12-02 23:26:52] <%ChromaticCorps3> @danvelly Hooray more Captain Locks. cohhBongos
[2022-12-02 23:27:23] <%Vosy1984> @Spero_Mcgee how do you plan to apply wither stacks?
[2022-12-02 23:27:47] <%Spero_Mcgee> withering step or wither / spell totem as per usual
[2022-12-02 23:27:52] <klauning> he still gonna do base-building later today?
[2022-12-02 23:27:55] <%Spero_Mcgee> unless there are uniques I forgot about
[2022-12-02 23:28:02] <%Vosy1984> because, correct me if I am wrong, with strike skills you want to use that totem thing that gives you attack speed
[2022-12-02 23:28:10] <%Spero_Mcgee> theres also withering touch support
[2022-12-02 23:28:27] <%Spero_Mcgee> ancestor totem? Could do that sure
[2022-12-02 23:28:36] <%DanVelly> @Spero_Mcgee Static Strike has more of a "3 second autobomber" feel to it that you refresh than the rampage like monster hunt that is dominating blow cohhHmm ... though not sure how much a difference the initial splash for static would make
[2022-12-02 23:28:38] <%Spero_Mcgee> I never tried a totem poison build tbh
[2022-12-02 23:28:44] <%Vosy1984> it lasts 2 second afaik
[2022-12-02 23:28:51] <%Spero_Mcgee> should be plausible actually
[2022-12-02 23:29:06] <%Vosy1984> the withering touch lasts 2 seconds
[2022-12-02 23:29:28] <%Vosy1984> so you need a constant source to apply it
[2022-12-02 23:29:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> doesnt matter, static strike keeps reapplying it through the beams
[2022-12-02 23:29:42] <%Spero_Mcgee> the only issue is the chance to proc it
[2022-12-02 23:29:58] <%Vosy1984> 1 in 4 COPIUM

[2022-12-02 23:33:04] <%Vosy1984> @Spero_Mcgee welp, this are all the players that played static strike and got to lvl 100, p.s. don't look at the guy who has 946k dps, he is not a league starter friendly build https://poe.ninja/challenge/builds?skill=Static-Strike
[2022-12-02 23:33:11] <%troderino> cohhSip Chat be cute cohhSIp
[2022-12-02 23:33:12] <%Grimelgi> if there is any gravity, Cohh can find a way cohhMy

[2022-12-02 23:33:35] <%Spero_Mcgee> I know Im asking about static strike, but im still curious about other strike skills though if chat as played with others. Because that notable is a change thats happening with 3.20
[2022-12-02 23:33:48] <%XanaduTheCaribou> It is in a prison on the moon - with artificial gravity one would think
[2022-12-02 23:34:11] <%KuroNekosama999> like I said you need to multiply the Cohh-efficient to get the true number cohhS
[2022-12-02 23:34:12] <%Kalbatronas> yeh but depends how well its working tho
[2022-12-02 23:34:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> Static Strike has always worked for me when it came to mapping to bigger issue was surviving
[2022-12-02 23:34:17] <%Vosy1984> here's week 1 of kalandra, 14117 players played static strke https://poe.ninja/challenge/builds?time-machine=week-1&skill=Static-Strike
[2022-12-02 23:34:43] <%Spero_Mcgee> thats alot considering how many people quit Kalandra league
[2022-12-02 23:35:08] <Vosy1984> the 90+ players playd for more than 1 week
[2022-12-02 23:35:13] <%Vosy1984> played*
[2022-12-02 23:35:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> another reason, is that I also liked Galvanic field that got added this league
[2022-12-02 23:35:34] <%Vosy1984> lowest lvl is lvl 94 there
[2022-12-02 23:35:53] <%Vosy1984> I played galvanic field, got it to red maps
[2022-12-02 23:35:58] <%Vosy1984> only mapped with it though
[2022-12-02 23:36:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> Hexes are also being changed so for bossing, going more into hexes might also be a good play
[2022-12-02 23:36:21] <%Spero_Mcgee> or combine it with a mark
[2022-12-02 23:36:40] <%Vosy1984> yes, but to take advantage of hexes, you might want more than 2

[2022-12-02 23:37:11] <%Spero_Mcgee> Well the only reason for me personally is just that I want as many sources that do Lightning damage at a time
[2022-12-02 23:37:22] <%Spero_Mcgee> All with the capability to poison
[2022-12-02 23:37:49] <%Astorma> Ahh Mortismal Gaming has again already 100%'d Callisto. Easy when you have a review copy. cohhBoom
[2022-12-02 23:37:51] <%Vosy1984> you only need 1 shock source with galvanic field, it can clear screen size if built correctly
[2022-12-02 23:38:00] <%Spero_Mcgee> just not sure what class to pick
[2022-12-02 23:38:22] <%Spero_Mcgee> Occultist would genuinely make a lot of sense
[2022-12-02 23:38:25] <%DanVelly> inquisitor sounds like a good choice... as many times
[2022-12-02 23:38:27] <%Vosy1984> elementalist has exposure, a lot of it
[2022-12-02 23:38:50] <%Kalbatronas> a full week till the next poe league irght?
[2022-12-02 23:38:51] <%Vosy1984> @DanVelly the conc ground got nerfed on inquisitor
[2022-12-02 23:38:52] <%Spero_Mcgee> I like the idea of being a slayer too
[2022-12-02 23:39:01] <%Vosy1984> @Kalbatronas yes
[2022-12-02 23:39:22] <%Vosy1984> slayer spells? might need a lot of str
[2022-12-02 23:39:23] <%Kalbatronas> cool gues will have to check the builds till its 2-3 days off
[2022-12-02 23:39:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> Ive never truly played as a slayer, but the AOE and cull at 20%
[2022-12-02 23:39:38] <%Kalbatronas> mady ziz will have godo builds again
[2022-12-02 23:39:40] <%DanVelly> @Kalbatronas roughly 6 days 20 hours and 20 minutes
[2022-12-02 23:39:52] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 Not too big of deal since they added Iron Will as a notable in 3.16
[2022-12-02 23:40:11] <%Kalbatronas> @DanVelly reminds me doctor strange there form before KEKW
[2022-12-02 23:40:14] <%Vosy1984> yes, I never built a spell caster south of scion though
[2022-12-02 23:40:20] <%Spero_Mcgee> theres also uniques like Doedres Tenure that got changed that give 100% spell damage now
[2022-12-02 23:40:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> or use the harbringer sword
[2022-12-02 23:40:36] <%Vosy1984> and reduced cast speed, carefull there
[2022-12-02 23:40:41] <%Spero_Mcgee> Heartbreaker has been a staple for me
[2022-12-02 23:40:49] <%Spero_Mcgee> doesnt matter when you cast while channel
[2022-12-02 23:40:53] <%Spero_Mcgee> or cast on crit
[2022-12-02 23:41:17] <%Spero_Mcgee> Lightning Exsanguinate was something I was cooking up but as an assassin
[2022-12-02 23:41:21] <%Vosy1984> you loose a socket with cast on channel
[2022-12-02 23:41:42] <%Spero_Mcgee> true but shouldnt matter during clearing
[2022-12-02 23:41:52] <%Spero_Mcgee> before a boss fight you could change the gem

[2022-12-02 23:46:17] <%Spero_Mcgee> so chances are people will farm harbringer

[2022-12-02 23:46:33] <%Vosy1984> you don't drop the maps by doing harbringer
[2022-12-02 23:46:38] <%+hellecus> Are the any boss in the misstland in Valheim?
[2022-12-02 23:46:38] <%Spero_Mcgee> which means any uniques from it mostr likely will be common
[2022-12-02 23:47:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> I thought the map drops for them were more likely to drop from harbringer
[2022-12-02 23:47:20] <%Spero_Mcgee> or did that change?
[2022-12-02 23:47:40] <%Vosy1984> I have 24 orbs of harbringer to make a harbringer map randomly, and I played around 500 hours this league
[2022-12-02 23:47:52] <%Vosy1984> probably used like 5, unsuccessfully

[2022-12-02 23:48:27] <%Spero_Mcgee> in any case, in any league as far as I can remember its been a cheap unique

[2022-12-02 23:50:20] <%Vosy1984> mathil's first build of the league is usually full rare

[2022-12-02 23:50:38] <%Vosy1984> kalandra wasn't bad
[2022-12-02 23:50:44] <%Spero_Mcgee> this new league could be shit and people would probably praise it

[2022-12-02 23:51:34] <%Spero_Mcgee> eh, I guess most people probaly didnt like it all that much, and Archnemesis being a thing ruined it even further
[2022-12-02 23:51:35] <%Vosy1984> tell you what, Atlas memories is where it's at
[2022-12-02 23:51:37] <%Spero_Mcgee> it did for me

[2022-12-02 23:53:42] <%Spero_Mcgee> Kalandra is going core?
[2022-12-02 23:53:49] <%Vosy1984> atlas memories buff your maps by a lot
[2022-12-02 23:53:53] <%Vosy1984> no
[2022-12-02 23:54:07] <%Spero_Mcgee> and atlas memories is part of kalandra right?
[2022-12-02 23:54:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> I only heard people talk about them
[2022-12-02 23:54:24] <%Vosy1984> they were introduced in that league, not part of the league mechanic
[2022-12-02 23:54:25] <%Spero_Mcgee> I quit after a few days

[2022-12-02 23:54:51] <%Spero_Mcgee> Ok. So atlas memories how do you get them?
[2022-12-02 23:55:07] <%Vosy1984> they drop in t14+ maps, and drop ~5 times the loot
[2022-12-02 23:55:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> so they are probably tough to beat then?
[2022-12-02 23:55:51] <%Vosy1984> I mean, if you're in t14 you're suppose to be able to, no?
[2022-12-02 23:56:02] <%Vosy1984> if not you deposit them for later when you can
[2022-12-02 23:56:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> You would think, but its not particularly difficult to simply clear maps
