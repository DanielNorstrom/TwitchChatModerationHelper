[2022-12-31 11:09:12] <SuperStarSar> Tbh young santos neymar was terrible with diving, but he got better. Still dives too much tho but I try to see past it bc he is such a good player aside from the dives lol
[2022-12-31 11:09:12] <%akino_cs> @Speyto i think people see both, but a player of his class and skill shouldnt dive as much as he did imo :(

[2022-12-31 11:51:25] <hugo_drone_strike> Maybe try turning crossplay off ? @boraslegend
[2022-12-31 11:51:26] <@%Paddeinho> Maybe on PC its different
[2022-12-31 11:51:27] <%+xRandy_Marsh> Xbox has an xbox icon and a crossplay icon
[2022-12-31 11:51:32] <@%Paddeinho> ive seen on PC players
[2022-12-31 11:51:33] <!%mohd94239> No I play ps5 and I see different Icon
[2022-12-31 11:51:34] <drac_in_da_house> only on pc u see pc badge
[2022-12-31 11:51:37] <@%Mintees1> It‚Äôs only different icons on pc
[2022-12-31 11:51:39] <$SEvector1037> crossplay icons are the same
[2022-12-31 11:51:49] <xgamevis> @Paddeinho Same
[2022-12-31 11:51:50] <+niKKon3> Im PC player and i can tell that We have PC as icon
[2022-12-31 11:51:55] <%+xRandy_Marsh> It's your console + crossplay icon
[2022-12-31 11:52:03] <@%trilungpark> that is History Maker, centurion promo is coming next week
[2022-12-31 11:52:13] <%+PocketPwoosi> on console you see xbox and PC as 1 Icon but on PC you sell all the different icons
[2022-12-31 11:52:14] <abbeyg4love> @nikkon3 is pc gameplay better??
[2022-12-31 11:52:16] <grubyczlowik> where is ur acc with Acuna ?
[2022-12-31 11:52:18] <@%Paddeinho> So weird that we on console dont see the PC tower badge
[2022-12-31 11:52:25] <@%Mintees1> It‚Äôs because PS can‚Äôt use an Xbox logo and Xbox can‚Äôt use a PS logo
[2022-12-31 11:52:30] <BaDDWolf_> @niKKon3 we are the only ones who see that  console dont see that icon

[2022-12-31 11:52:47] <%+PocketPwoosi> im on pc

[2022-12-31 11:53:33] <%+xRandy_Marsh> Only PC players see the tower
[2022-12-31 11:53:36] <@%Mintees1> It will show same icon on Xbox and PS, only on PC will it show differently @boraslegend
[2022-12-31 11:53:41] <@%Mintees1> @baddwolf_ yepp
[2022-12-31 11:53:44] <+niKKon3> @Sinthriaa u are just too poor probably, buy better pc components and then u might
[2022-12-31 11:53:47] <+saymenq91> why 0:0 ? wasn't 7:0 like 20min ago?
[2022-12-31 11:53:47] <%+PocketPwoosi> It shows screen and a tower unit
[2022-12-31 11:53:50] <+kaerr_blockbuster> @abbeyg4love it is hidden u get the card if u do what he said
[2022-12-31 11:53:52] <+stefan940> @Sinthriaa no need for 200fps unless you have a 240hz monitor
