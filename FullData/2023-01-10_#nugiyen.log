[2023-01-10 12:15:11] <@%XaiTV> cause you have like 20M damage, but that's with 20 SRS up attacking the same target over 10s
[2023-01-10 12:15:22] <@%XaiTV> when clearing your SRS won't target the same target
[2023-01-10 12:15:26] <Vosy1984> poison ramps in time, and you don't want "in time" for map clearing
[2023-01-10 12:15:28] <@%XaiTV> and they won't attack for 10s I hope LOLW

[2023-01-10 14:51:25] <space_turtle> the problem for me is games being shaped around dark patterns of monetization, not the type of game

[2023-01-10 14:53:03] <space_turtle> i still prefer old XCOM to the reboot XCOM

[2023-01-10 14:53:30] <+klone_iron_fist> @space_turtle original xcom is really good, but the reboot series is also very good
[2023-01-10 14:53:50] <Zorumero> didn't they just make that marvel game though
[2023-01-10 14:53:50] <+klone_iron_fist> the ones in between the first two and the last two are pretty bad though

[2023-01-10 14:54:07] <space_turtle> @klone_iron_fist the "first" reboot was good. then it became to sterile and abstract. XCOM2 all the humanity was taken by making them "mech" like. now with the aliens being playable it's just too whacky
[2023-01-10 14:54:12] <%+illoomenated> yea
[2023-01-10 14:54:15] <!%+Arakki> the original xcom was really fun and I don't think it was based on a board game, but obviously it behaved like one
[2023-01-10 14:54:24] <+zodeggg> @punyh_ yes and no, for example blizzard learned their lesson and there will not be p2w in diablo4 I'm sure

[2023-01-10 15:12:40] <@%+DerangedM8> @nugiyen wrong scene btw sir
[2023-01-10 15:12:41] <@%Andrew756> ggg: we are bringing reworked AN back
[2023-01-10 15:12:45] <!%+Arakki> went 2^31/60 and it gave me an  answer
[2023-01-10 15:12:49] <ResurrectionByElection> next league Jebaited
[2023-01-10 15:12:51] <%+illoomenated> i feel like i dont want to start ruthless project before a new league now
[2023-01-10 15:12:51] <systemplayerlost> I've been so burned out after the last 6 months of practice and races, barely played this league
[2023-01-10 15:12:58] <@%Andrew756> peepoLeave
[2023-01-10 15:13:00] <%+illoomenated> hehe
[2023-01-10 15:13:11] <OscarHinz> next league may be last league before poe2 huh?
[2023-01-10 15:13:25] <systemplayerlost> no shot
[2023-01-10 15:13:27] <crkd> @nugiyen for "too much player damage" ant defences are op, you are not the most HC player nowadays just FIY
[2023-01-10 15:13:27] <%+illoomenated> i hope next league will have a mechanic that is incredible :D
[2023-01-10 15:13:36] <@%Andrew756> before poe2 beta maybe
[2023-01-10 15:13:39] <Zorumero> PoE 2 COPIUM
[2023-01-10 15:13:46] <@QuackSage> @nugiyen scene
[2023-01-10 15:13:53] <Vosy1984> 2 leagues until beta, 2 more leagues until release maybe
[2023-01-10 15:13:53] <Virolancer> PoE will come out in 2023 COPIUM
[2023-01-10 15:14:00] <%+illoomenated> why does it have to be called poe 2 if it's nothing special about it?
[2023-01-10 15:14:03] <@%+DerangedM8> they said they either release or announce beta at exilecon
[2023-01-10 15:14:06] VIEWERS: 409
[2023-01-10 15:14:10] <%ampdecay> probably like 6 leagues before PoE2 imo
[2023-01-10 15:14:13] <@%Andrew756> @illoomenated marketing
[2023-01-10 15:14:15] <globalpotato123> they will show something about poe2 in 2 leagues before d4 releases but i doubt we get beta until end of summer/year probably
[2023-01-10 15:14:15] <%+illoomenated> people say it will just be like poe 1 with a new leauge
[2023-01-10 15:14:19] <@%Andrew756> can't sell poe patch 4.0
[2023-01-10 15:14:22] <%+illoomenated> @Andrew756 yea ofc
[2023-01-10 15:14:30] <OscarHinz> ahhh right, beta
[2023-01-10 15:14:40] <space_turtle> poe2 will have to have significant changes to make poe futureproof. cause it can't go on like this.
[2023-01-10 15:14:47] <@%Andrew756> COPIUM
[2023-01-10 15:14:49] <Vosy1984> between 4 and 6 more leagues is a good estimate, we don't want a rushed project @nugiyen
[2023-01-10 15:14:57] <@%+DerangedM8> i meaaaan... nothing special? KEKW @illoomenated
[2023-01-10 15:15:17] <%+illoomenated> i dunno ^^
[2023-01-10 15:15:22] <systemplayerlost> game is in a pretty ok state right now, just need some meta shake up and we'll be good for another few leagues until 2
[2023-01-10 15:15:23] <globalpotato123> @space_turtle like what? this league is crazy good what you on about LULW

[2023-01-10 15:16:20] <systemplayerlost> from memory someone said they're making some skills for poe2 to be poe1 viable
[2023-01-10 15:16:22] <Vosy1984> LUL
[2023-01-10 15:16:34] <space_turtle> @globalpotato123 it's not just about the gimmick/minigames of the leagues. it's about powercreep. general farmspeed. itemcreep. they need to cut back on all of that to have a foundation to expand further. if you expand on THIS it will be a disaster.
[2023-01-10 15:16:39] <@%Andrew756> look i've seen reddit frontpage during 4.1 release: stale meta ggg why is armour piercing bolt used on every character

[2023-01-10 15:17:10] <+klone_iron_fist> just for the release hype
[2023-01-10 15:17:28] <globalpotato123> @space_turtle they do that already not every single league but some of them, poe2 will have more changes sure but it wont change the game completly if thats what you are hoping
[2023-01-10 15:17:36] <patchesmcdoogal> ... but damage good

[2023-01-10 15:18:07] <+aluskn> I don't get why people want POE2 to 'change the game completely'. I mean, I've been playing the game for 10 years because I like the game.  I just want the same but better with new stuff.
[2023-01-10 15:18:23] <globalpotato123> @aluskn this 100%
[2023-01-10 15:18:31] <%+TwitchPlusMe> PoE 2? Where? nugiPeepers nugiCheck
[2023-01-10 15:18:32] <systemplayerlost> yeah 100%
[2023-01-10 15:19:01] <+tnkhanh> the heck? that kill looks funny as hell
[2023-01-10 15:19:05] <Zorumero> i think it is quite noticeable that they have taken ressources from the ongoing development of poe to use on the development of poe 2
[2023-01-10 15:19:13] <@QuackSage> @nugiyen scene
[2023-01-10 15:19:14] <space_turtle> this has nothing to be "changing completely" it has to be a "refined" reduction so further expansions can actually be meaningful. you can't just expand expand expans, add add add, while keeping the old content

[2023-01-10 15:21:06] <Vosy1984> am i the only one who dislikes shied charge?
[2023-01-10 15:21:19] <ryuukk__> @aluskn there are design decisions that are too dated and are limiting the gameplay, like name locking for example, this needs reword, melee shouldn't need "additional strike" to feel better
[2023-01-10 15:21:22] <space_turtle> the biggest change i am looking forward to is the Templar not being an old naked creep wrapped in a tablecloth anymore.
[2023-01-10 15:21:24] <%MrBonkeyDollax> Good logbooks can be worth splitting Synovus, honestly the only thing I've ever used one on
[2023-01-10 15:21:35] <OscarHinz> most people may not notice the changes with the "additions" in poe1, the lore is expanding with each league
[2023-01-10 15:21:46] <+tnkhanh> wait, SRS is not using your weapon anymore
[2023-01-10 15:21:46] <Vosy1984> if I have dex on the build I always go dash

[2023-01-10 15:22:27] <systemplayerlost> yeah we'll be able to actively communicate to make sure everyone gets required colours etc, my filter at least has r-g random links extra highlighted as well to make sure we get movement sockets
