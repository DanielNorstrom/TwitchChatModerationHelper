[2022-12-10 02:48:21] <@DemiOfDerp> @CODENAMEDERPY Thank you, thank you
[2022-12-10 02:48:24] <BDrumev> Excited about this game!
[2022-12-10 02:48:40] <Daedrias0> wow. so that was true : you will strike the earth for a loooong time
[2022-12-10 02:48:48] <%casualltea> hi all. super glad to catch a stream tonight
[2022-12-10 02:48:51] <+CODENAMEDERPY> ohhhh That is a poor ui feature

[2022-12-10 02:49:12] <RasakBlood> I would call that a bug
[2022-12-10 02:49:15] <+milkman_x> base 7 math? lol
[2022-12-10 02:49:18] <capriwins> that will get fixed quickly tho, just need to add more roman numeral graphics
[2022-12-10 02:49:18] <$trueheartthetruthstealer> how are the steam mods been good?
[2022-12-10 02:49:25] <Metal__Beard> we need to be able to save some basic work order and work detail loadouts.
[2022-12-10 02:49:26] <MassiveBreaker> We should be able to give custom images
[2022-12-10 02:49:36] <%$Arrek85> @milkman_x IKR Base 12 or nothing!
[2022-12-10 02:49:37] <@DemiOfDerp> I feel like they might be placeholders
[2022-12-10 02:49:46] <+CODENAMEDERPY> Available sprite set would be awesome
[2022-12-10 02:49:50] <ItsRender> I downloaded the mod that adds that @Aavak
[2022-12-10 02:50:04] <%Flabbergaster22> Okay I'm back. I had to go back and watch the Tilly cams I missed. She is SO pretty
[2022-12-10 02:50:06] <%+mCarter9444> base2 FTW!
[2022-12-10 02:50:09] <%+ckHawk00> mods will fix it! mods fix all
[2022-12-10 02:50:48] <+maximilianus27> It should definitely be easier than implementing procedural generation of infinite number using roman numerals.
[2022-12-10 02:51:07] <%$Arrek85> Hsssssssss ckHawk00 That way leads to Bethesda Design.

[2022-12-10 02:51:45] <%$Arrek85> @ckHawk00 That's a bad thing
[2022-12-10 02:51:48] <@DemiOfDerp> I planned on making a special area with individual workshops for all my legendary crafters. But then the queen showed up
[2022-12-10 02:51:49] <+CODENAMEDERPY> Hopefully they'll do some quick fixes

[2022-12-10 02:52:40] <%+mCarter9444> yes!  Dr. Carter survives
[2022-12-10 02:52:45] <+CODENAMEDERPY> Good intentions
[2022-12-10 02:52:52] <$InfernDragon> I think there is a seperate labour menu for each individual character.
[2022-12-10 02:52:52] <+CSBoty> my bet is some of that just doesn't have an implemented ui yet and is still in the code
[2022-12-10 02:52:58] <Zhinj> The labor screen seems a bit incomplete, so I think/hope it will be improved

[2022-12-10 02:55:43] <%entrancedbythewild> What is winrar?
[2022-12-10 02:55:47] <unclezoid14> in fact, many people install mods for more granular job management control
[2022-12-10 02:56:00] <Shazarius> @entrancedbythewild 7zip but different

[2022-12-10 02:56:09] <+Narouge> @Aavak i dont fully agree, me and sevral others i know are enifcent on purpose.

[2022-12-10 02:56:23] <%garsemor1> I would say that I would still prefer the option to micromanage more. It's 100% personal, the "forced lack of control" I just find taking away from my enjoyement

[2022-12-10 02:59:34] <%garsemor1> DF is a game of depth. so when the "convenience of simplicity" takes away from one of the games biggest draws, I think that is a flaw of design
[2022-12-10 02:59:54] <Gefyra> Can you not do that on the specific crafting table?

[2022-12-10 03:00:55] <+Narouge> well they can get unhappy, and deal with it, till the goblins kill them. Im not going micro manage the dwarves, when fortress need designing, upgradeing, etc.

[2022-12-10 03:04:14] <%+DisillusionedAcronym> for a "failure is fun" game where your fort is expected to fail on a consistent basis, you'd hope the game-beginning-tasks would be easier. or, honestly, preferably be save/load-able.

[2022-12-10 03:18:56] <%$vulpetrem> So, the plan is to make a temporary fort, make the main fort while we live in the temporary fort, then somehow move into the main fort?
[2022-12-10 03:19:19] <@DemiOfDerp> @IridiuLugia I've heard rumors the steam version does, at least. Can't say for sure though

[2022-12-10 03:19:44] <+IridiuLugia> @DemiOfDerp that would be good. In contrast to e.g. Rimworld lol
[2022-12-10 03:19:50] <%ckHawk00> or are you doing it per person showing up?
[2022-12-10 03:19:59] <EmperorBulby> Is this still the same fort from the first stream? Or has that fort been destroyed?

[2022-12-10 03:38:53] <%SweetOrangeBunny> @ranger225500 I recall, though from quite some time ago, that siege engines were very limited in how they aimed (only cardinal directions iirc) unless you had a DFHack patch. Was quite some time ago so I hope it's changed.
[2022-12-10 03:39:08] <ItsRender> is there any way to place dirt on stone so i can make a farm? or do i just need to go above ground to place my farm?
[2022-12-10 03:39:13] <+Adders666> definitely better than engraving a room with elves and trees though
[2022-12-10 03:39:14] <TiberWolf> this game is the most micro of managements
[2022-12-10 03:39:21] <@DemiOfDerp> I think they didn't want to frontload the micromanagement too hevily and in the process ended up shoving it way too far back in regards to the jobs

[2022-12-10 03:41:42] <EmperorBulby> What if the walls of the fort are made of sulphur?
[2022-12-10 03:41:46] <+ranger225500> iIrc dragon fire is not the same as fire
[2022-12-10 03:41:49] <CptHeadcrab> Use a really aggressive oxidizer and it'll burn
[2022-12-10 03:41:55] <EmperorBulby> Is sulphur even flammable?
[2022-12-10 03:42:01] <Beldare53> yes
[2022-12-10 03:42:02] <+Adders666> bitumous coal walls ftw
[2022-12-10 03:42:03] <TwoPointPerspective> And to be fair, the comedy of errors caused by your spider obsessed engraver terrifying the arachnophobe noble because you didn't micromanage the situation *is* a pretty funny story
[2022-12-10 03:42:13] <%garsemor1> The issue is that when there is too little micro it starts getting in the way of thestory more then if there is too much, because if there is too much you can at least choos to be more relaxed about it, you can't CHOOSE to care more then the game will let you, and when the game doesn't let me comfortably interact with those wonderful little details that make the game so magical, it makes the game "lesser" imo
[2022-12-10 03:42:34] <%adiduck> I love that the dapperling attitude here is "everything is flammable if you try hard and believe in yourself"

[2022-12-10 03:50:23] <MaffieNZ> the meaning of functional is relative

[2022-12-10 03:51:59] <MaffieNZ> in your first game, not starving might be functional - in your second game, dealing with the inevitable goblin armies might be functional

[2022-12-10 03:54:00] <+ranger225500> well idk aavak diamond dust on a arrow might pierce more
[2022-12-10 03:54:12] <$InfernDragon> To be honest... gold is deadly in Dwarf fortress though... It was the only way for my adventurer to kill a collusus.

[2022-12-10 03:54:17] <EmperorBulby> Well, you could arrange the gems so the bolt head is jagged and leaves nastier gashes.

[2022-12-10 04:03:05] <TwoPointPerspective> @rjmac5 We call that a Transatlantic accent. Hearing folks from all around the world speak all day on the internet affects how we speak in subtle ways
[2022-12-10 04:03:07] <EmperorBulby> First off, Australia, South Africa, and America have a large amount of accents. And are all on different CONTINENTS.
[2022-12-10 04:03:08] <@DemiOfDerp> Next year: 40+ migrants!
[2022-12-10 04:03:21] <rjmac5> @EmperorBulby Yeah that was my point, the accents I've been told I have are blatantly different!
[2022-12-10 04:03:23] <TwoPointPerspective> Which can trigger false alarms in what we expect from certain accents

[2022-12-10 04:04:24] <@%+Leafein> I generally suck at identifying accents. It impresses me when someone can tell I am greek, when even greeks think I either lived or studied abroad due to my accent being changed from all the english speaking. I am in awe every time.
[2022-12-10 04:04:39] <$Meatmopper> Hello Aavak and friends! =]
[2022-12-10 04:04:43] <@%+Leafein> And even still, I cannot confuse Aavak with Lathrix XD
[2022-12-10 04:04:51] <%kaijuwrangler> so is this still the same map?
[2022-12-10 04:05:09] <NuclearArchmage> yes its the same map
[2022-12-10 04:05:16] <@DemiOfDerp> They wanted to join the fun
[2022-12-10 04:05:31] <%asureastorm> I'm an American living in Texas that grew up in the Ozark Hills and Mexico, both of which are locations in Missouri. I have my normal "accent" that no one can place, and no less than 6 accents I can put on accurately because I literally spoke them at some point.
[2022-12-10 04:05:37] VIEWERS: 778
[2022-12-10 04:06:10] <EmperorBulby> Doed anyone else get a little annoyed when people boil down the accents and dialects of the states, and Canada to a similar extent, to 4 or so accents? Because each of those countries seperately are enormous. Given britain has so many distinct dialects and accents, it should be very obvious that those would have so many more due to the sheer size.
[2022-12-10 04:06:25] <2908_Juno> have u peeked into legends mode ??

[2022-12-10 04:53:03] <Jajarra> flux is stuff used in steel smelting, I think?
[2022-12-10 04:53:13] <%asureastorm> Various stones can be flux...chalk, limestone, others. DFWiki has a list that's still accurate.
[2022-12-10 04:53:13] <alpha_5h311> flux is stone with ... calcite? which could be many different kinds of stone
[2022-12-10 04:53:13] <$mokkun_> lead if you are having smiths lowing hammers or for some reason whips.
[2022-12-10 04:53:16] <@DemiOfDerp> Flux is for steel, yes
[2022-12-10 04:53:20] <@%belial007> @Valor248 sadly no. not that we have seen at least
[2022-12-10 04:53:23] <Mortichar> @EmperorBulby It's a few different types of stone. You need flux for smelting steel. Calcite, marble, and chalk are all flux stones.

[2022-12-10 04:54:35] <3rdlevelwizard> When I have a fort with only copper ores, I can usually trade for cassiterite.  Smelt with a copper ore for bronze.  Nearly as good as iron.

[2022-12-10 05:04:09] <+haaaaaaaaaazel> wait dammit its just the colour of the leaves sigh
[2022-12-10 05:04:12] <Mortichar> @Laudi2204 It's individual. You need to make a boot twice per dwarf.
[2022-12-10 05:04:19] <@%belial007> Aavak, that means its dprTEA time
[2022-12-10 05:04:20] <@DemiOfDerp> Sometimes you make sense but the words just come out wrong
[2022-12-10 05:04:40] <Laudi2204> @Cynder_Dragon alright, so it might be possible for a dwarf or other pawn to wear shoes from a different set? that must be uncomfortable... is there a debuff for sth like that?
[2022-12-10 05:04:50] <@DemiOfDerp> @belial007 Tea!? No, it's time for dwarven rum!
[2022-12-10 05:05:16] <%+Cynder_Dragon> @Laudi2204 I'm a new player, so I don't know more than that

[2022-12-10 05:05:52] <Laudi2204> @Cynder_Dragon no worries, but I wouldn't be surprised tbh :D
[2022-12-10 05:06:19] <Mortichar> @Laudi2204 No debuffs, but each foot will respond differently when attacked. A leather boot and a metal boot, for example.
[2022-12-10 05:06:55] <%+Cynder_Dragon> But what if algae grows on those logs, and contaminates the water or something LUL
[2022-12-10 05:07:14] <kzzn777> oh
[2022-12-10 05:07:17] <kzzn777> I see
[2022-12-10 05:07:19] <Uplinkedxd> I've currently found the COOLEST place for my Dwarves' home. I've dug this huge spiral staircase and I'm now making a big stone bridge above a magma sea.
[2022-12-10 05:07:20] <+Valor248> Might be worth mentioning pressure/water levels
[2022-12-10 05:07:24] <kzzn777> and it'll never end?
[2022-12-10 05:07:25] <Laudi2204> @Mortichar fortunately, thank you
[2022-12-10 05:07:41] <Laudi2204> @Cynder_Dragon and thank you too of course :)
[2022-12-10 05:07:47] <kzzn777> I was making a channel but my dwarfs have to keep filling it up
[2022-12-10 05:07:50] <+mtgo_mike> How far down can a well reach?
[2022-12-10 05:07:51] VIEWERS: 820
[2022-12-10 05:08:26] <@DemiOfDerp> I think it's infinte
[2022-12-10 05:08:53] <Mortichar> It's 1 rope/chain, and it can go all the way down.

[2022-12-10 05:09:14] <capriwins> does the well need a roof?
[2022-12-10 05:09:19] <%BloodyFalcan> no way of closing off the cistern?
[2022-12-10 05:09:27] <AkiraDragonborne> What are all those tiny little things roving in and out of your fort around the cats and dogs? Flies?
[2022-12-10 05:09:28] <Jajarra> are fortifications still a thing, and do they still allow water?
[2022-12-10 05:09:32] <kzzn777> should I set one up close to the doctor?

[2022-12-10 05:10:20] <@DemiOfDerp> Water is for sick peeps
[2022-12-10 05:10:24] <JohnLG1> Don't think fortifications can be destroyed, since they're constructions
[2022-12-10 05:10:31] <Mortichar> running out of booze? might as well restart D:
[2022-12-10 05:10:35] <kzzn777> I see, so if they have booze they don't need water?

[2022-12-10 05:12:39] <Jajarra> That actually reminds me of I think A Beautiful Mind, where a character describes dying of dehydration as the worst hangover in the world

[2022-12-10 05:57:27] <Dragonheart1132> its probably in pain
[2022-12-10 05:57:28] <bonndde> based on my experience, you can't control them. it's sort of random
[2022-12-10 05:57:32] <Highmunten> I read that the undead are neutral to your necro when raised
[2022-12-10 05:57:32] <Dragonheart1132> i dont blame it
[2022-12-10 05:57:39] <@%+Leafein> Why would a necromancer raise something that would be aggressive towards them O.o
[2022-12-10 05:57:48] <%asureastorm> Not to the necro, but they are hostile to the fort.
[2022-12-10 05:57:48] <Highmunten> but if your necro attacks them they become hostile
[2022-12-10 05:57:48] <Jajarra> laughs
[2022-12-10 05:57:53] <3rdlevelwizard> Not if it’s one of your dwarves.
[2022-12-10 05:58:10] VIEWERS: 859
[2022-12-10 05:58:14] <bakafox> Sometimes they raise ones that are friendly, it's really weird
[2022-12-10 05:58:16] <@%+Leafein> What if everyone in the fort is a necromancer?
[2022-12-10 05:58:20] <$InfernDragon> So you don't want a necromancer on a squad
[2022-12-10 05:58:24] <bakafox> I've seen Kruggsmash get all kinds of necro results
[2022-12-10 05:58:31] <@DemiOfDerp> For intelligent beings there are several kinds of undead, I'm pretty sure. Not sure if they are all the product of a necromancer
[2022-12-10 05:58:55] <%asureastorm> At least in 0.47. Haven't run into a necro in 0.50.
[2022-12-10 05:59:11] <@DemiOfDerp> But he just wanted to be an undead Disney princess!
[2022-12-10 05:59:14] <kornak02> i believe even fingers can go undead and run after you (somehow)
[2022-12-10 05:59:28] <bakafox> IIRC if the necromancer manages to raise an intelligent undead they will usually be friendly, but dumb zombies are more likely to aggro fortress members
[2022-12-10 05:59:31] <$InfernDragon> Necromancers don't need to eat food/drink. So they would make perfect managers
[2022-12-10 05:59:51] <ApplePieReplica> @kornak02 mussel shells are the worst
[2022-12-10 05:59:56] <3rdlevelwizard> You could make the necromancer a scholar.
[2022-12-10 06:00:00] <ha4m9n6> uh undead dwarves are usually not hostile but can be

[2022-12-10 06:28:21] <MrUnimportantNumbr4> is it one of those weird conditions where rock is removed because the suggestions has rock

[2022-12-10 06:28:27] <ha4m9n6> i think thats it acully
[2022-12-10 06:28:35] <%Starmage> isnt "metal armor" (for uniforms) another such a case where by default there is something that if you delete it you cant manually recreate that condition again.
[2022-12-10 06:29:02] <sonicblade38> @Starmage yup i did that with leather armor
[2022-12-10 06:29:12] <+Seagoingmanatee> its under adj as rock items
[2022-12-10 06:29:18] <+Seagoingmanatee> I think
[2022-12-10 06:29:36] <+radical_jack_> is it under type? i feel like it's a weird menu option here
[2022-12-10 06:29:36] <%asureastorm> I mean, the brothers will be working on this game until they're both dead lol
[2022-12-10 06:29:42] <jo_rokker> also in defense of the game: lots of great tutorials out all ready making it very easy to understand how these menus work

[2022-12-10 06:30:29] <%Starmage> "non economic" might be stones?  as economic is ores and such?

[2022-12-10 06:30:43] <@DemiOfDerp> Rock is like the dwarven vanilla, it doesn't need to be stated retoLel
[2022-12-10 06:30:56] <Jajarra> I only accept my crowns after they've been ritualistically murdered and the intrinsic spirit within has been banished
[2022-12-10 06:31:14] <NuclearArchmage> the game might just be trolling you
[2022-12-10 06:31:16] <ha4m9n6> inb4 its based on manager skill
[2022-12-10 06:31:21] <MrUnimportantNumbr4> it was probably removed because suggestions has rock so you should not ever need to find rock
[2022-12-10 06:31:27] <@%belial007> are the specific type of stones instead of just 'rock'?
[2022-12-10 06:31:29] <+Seagoingmanatee> the search in this game is really bad as well
[2022-12-10 06:31:40] <Dragonator_g> @jo_rokker any game that requires the sort of research a master’s degree would need isn’t really a good game. It may be a fantastic simulation, but not a good game by modern standards

[2022-12-10 06:32:27] <jo_rokker> oh I agree @Dragonator_g but the creators are legally insane and it is their insane creation, unfortunately
[2022-12-10 06:32:44] <orb_of_crows> im so confused whats going on chst
[2022-12-10 06:33:23] <Kivipaperisakset> the use of economic rock is also restricted somewhere else, righT?

[2022-12-10 06:34:00] <$LionelParks> But at the end of the day...rock and stone, to the bone.
[2022-12-10 06:34:22] <Kivipaperisakset> doesn't stone here count as the stones that appear after mining, as opposed to cut (and lighter) blocks?
[2022-12-10 06:34:23] VIEWERS: 888
[2022-12-10 06:34:26] <3rdlevelwizard> Could you just pick one rock to make them from?
[2022-12-10 06:34:30] <$InfernDragon> Probably needs a type of stone like chert or something
[2022-12-10 06:34:32] <Kivipaperisakset> (although both are made of rock)
[2022-12-10 06:34:41] <%Starmage> i guess you could set a stockpile to just accept stone crowns and then link that stockpile to teh workshop?
[2022-12-10 06:34:57] <@DemiOfDerp> Dwarven vanilla
[2022-12-10 06:35:18] <Jajarra> Would dwarven vanilla be fungus based versus a bean?
[2022-12-10 06:35:30] <VikingDan> would not having "rock" on the 'unimproved crowns' matter for the work order though? as youll only be making stone crowns as it is, so they will be the only ones that are being counted/worked on? or are you more looking to replicate the condition for future reference?
[2022-12-10 06:35:40] <@DemiOfDerp> That seems like an oversight to have neither stone nor wood
[2022-12-10 06:35:40] <%leafypew> I been making crowns out of shell...
[2022-12-10 06:35:43] <Kivipaperisakset> no no, this is essential df

[2022-12-10 06:36:22] <+Seagoingmanatee> couldn't you use the game default and then scroll through the lists to see whats checked?

[2022-12-10 06:36:38] <@%belial007> yah you 100% should be able to replicate without going on a quest
[2022-12-10 06:36:40] <%+Worgensnack> maybe try log?
[2022-12-10 06:36:44] <MrUnimportantNumbr4> this is interesting because I am of the opinion of something being in a very identifiable place then it does not need to be replicated
[2022-12-10 06:36:50] <%Starmage> yea there are a bunch of cases where you cant recreate the default thing like that... and its like that for years
[2022-12-10 06:36:51] <Kivipaperisakset> iirc there is no adjective "wooden" and you have to use "plant" instead :P
[2022-12-10 06:37:23] <ha4m9n6> some one made a feature request for this on kitfox bug reports for df
[2022-12-10 06:38:17] <Kivipaperisakset> now you're not in the adjective tab

[2022-12-10 06:38:31] <VikingDan> is it not only specifying "rock crowns" on that condition list, because its for a "rock crown" order?
[2022-12-10 06:39:11] <+SifTheGreatGreyWoof> I hate that too. I've been struggling to place floors under furniture for a while now.
[2022-12-10 06:39:12] <VikingDan> so if you were creating wooden crowns, the condition on that order would then specify wooden crowns?
[2022-12-10 06:39:12] <Malakin0> yo, what’s goin on?
[2022-12-10 06:39:14] <3rdlevelwizard> Oh snap!
[2022-12-10 06:39:23] <@%belial007> and this ties back in with the work orders
[2022-12-10 06:39:50] <MrUnimportantNumbr4> so can you search rock now

[2022-12-10 06:40:25] <jo_rokker> Food was the main issue for me at first. understanding how seeds in this game works is a lifesaver. if you cook (Plump Helmets for example) you wont get any seeds back. you can only brew it. Go into the Labors menu (bottom left) "y" and Kitchen tab, mark Plump Helmets as not cooked and only brewed.  If you cook your plump helmets, as default settings, you won't get seeds back and will run out.
[2022-12-10 06:40:50] <FMGee_> @jo_rokker This is definitely a big trap for newbies.
[2022-12-10 06:41:28] <Jajarra> Subtle teaching tool to show players that Dwarves consider booze more critical than food
[2022-12-10 06:41:34] <Kivipaperisakset> heh, seeds can get weirder when  you have bags of seeds and how they stockpile into barrels... I  don't recall the exact thing, but I think there was some way to get seed stockpiles etc completely messed up
[2022-12-10 06:42:03] <jo_rokker> For sure @FMGee_ imagine only starting out with 20 seeds and not knowing this crucial information. you constantly die
[2022-12-10 06:42:28] VIEWERS: 885
[2022-12-10 06:42:29] <%stasis098> there was a type button in that row. Does that not do anything?
[2022-12-10 06:42:36] <$Feggas> Aren't Blue parking signs legal when the winter equinox falls on a Friday during even numbered years?
[2022-12-10 06:42:36] <+Zenzi_Aurora> cant you manually change the  search conditions?
[2022-12-10 06:42:44] <FMGee_> @jo_rokker Yep. On the other hand, it does also encourage you to trade for seeds, so it isnt always a run-ender
[2022-12-10 06:42:59] <3rdlevelwizard> Maybe dwarves can’t work like that with wooden crowns.
[2022-12-10 06:43:11] <%+Xenophanes420> Garbage in garbage out
[2022-12-10 06:43:15] <gnawg> have you considered simply testing on prod instead
[2022-12-10 06:43:19] <sonicblade38> is it maybe a wording issue? like how stone chairs are thrones but wood ones are chairs?

[2022-12-10 06:45:54] <crateholio> @VikingDan if you are sure you won't have any other types of crowns laying around, yes.  But if you have other kinds they would still count against your condition

[2022-12-10 06:52:24] <%Starmage> @Aavak what if you limit the material like "rock and wood crowns" in a linked workshop... so they just store these in there and just these get used for a workorder in that workshop. instead of trying to set teh materials in the work order.
[2022-12-10 06:52:31] VIEWERS: 957
[2022-12-10 06:53:27] <VikingDan> i think you can use the left hand volumn of #+- on the work orders screen to change the work order location too
[2022-12-10 06:53:40] <Jajarra> Alright, time for bed. Good luck with the order fiddling Aavak, and farewell all. See you in vodland when these eventually get on to youtube.
[2022-12-10 06:53:41] <ha4m9n6> it just limits the amout of work rders that one hsop can take if others are busy
[2022-12-10 06:53:43] <VikingDan> *column
[2022-12-10 06:54:04] <%EntropicRadar> i imagine that means it only throw 5 different orders from the general work orders onto that workshop, in case you want to keep it clear or load it down as a general workorder workshop

[2022-12-10 06:54:50] <ha4m9n6> that might have been dfhack yea
[2022-12-10 06:54:52] <%Starmage> that the workorders made in the work orders screen are "general" and different to the work orders made with the button at a workshop isnt really explained much.

[2022-12-10 06:57:36] <ha4m9n6> how good is the tutorial acully
[2022-12-10 06:57:40] <+Milkstopher> newbie here. any tips on keeping seed count high? I always seem to run out
[2022-12-10 06:57:47] <%EntropicRadar> or at least, start with a younger world set before the encdromancings dominate
[2022-12-10 06:57:48] <FMGee_> Sorry I zoned out for a second. Was the problem that we couldn't allocate specific dwarves to work orders?
[2022-12-10 06:58:17] <%EntropicRadar> @Milkstopher stop your cooks from cooking the plants in question, it destroys seeds. leave em for brewers, which harvest the seeds for reuse
[2022-12-10 06:58:20] <%+Worgensnack> @Milkstopher don't cook your plump helmets, cooking them doesn't give seeds back

[2022-12-10 06:58:52] <+Milkstopher> oh i must be missing that option somewhere. thanks!
[2022-12-10 06:59:03] <ha4m9n6> im kinda sad plump helmets are not automaticlly disabled from cooking
[2022-12-10 06:59:04] <jo_rokker> @Milkstopher did you allow them to cook with the seeds? and cook too many meals cos then you wont get the seeds back. you only get the seeds back if you brew. you can easily regulate this by putting certain foods to brew only
[2022-12-10 06:59:10] <AtomicCheddar> PixelBob
[2022-12-10 07:00:01] <jo_rokker> I reckon its safe to put the plump helmets back to cooking allowed once you have a decent stock
[2022-12-10 07:00:16] <%asureastorm> The other thing is get a manager! You get a lot more control over production.
[2022-12-10 07:00:27] <%+Worgensnack> oh speaking of @Aavak you know not to let honey go into finished goods bins if you want to cook with it right?
[2022-12-10 07:00:29] <ha4m9n6> i also set a seed condition on my food work order and brewing

[2022-12-10 08:16:21] <Lukaracha> Try searching first the material, like: wood -> cup
[2022-12-10 08:16:53] <R00gle> rock mug ?
[2022-12-10 08:17:03] <Darkfirephoenix> Why not use cat-paws to hold liquids? They can hold ALL OF THE LIQUIDS!

[2022-12-10 08:17:18] <$Graknorke> the generic term is goblet
[2022-12-10 08:17:19] <Call_me_ishmail> @Darkfirephoenix They used to. Fixed that a while ago.
[2022-12-10 08:17:19] <levstk> because they use raw categories
[2022-12-10 08:17:32] <%Starmage> heh "craft rock mug" workorder has the rock mugs in their suggested as usual
[2022-12-10 08:18:21] <Darkfirephoenix> How about cups/mugs made out of bone? Specifically the skulls of ELFS!
[2022-12-10 08:18:21] <levstk> if you specify the material in the conditions, the name might change, maybe
[2022-12-10 08:18:31] <TNSe_> oh no, who is the grumpy dwarf

[2022-12-10 08:19:38] <levstk> can they get to the drinks?

[2022-12-10 08:19:50] <Rexxig> yes its in the open
[2022-12-10 08:20:03] <Call_me_ishmail> worst part is, that was the only way to get people to stop. nerfing the prices into the ground, adding a negative moodlet, none of it worked.

[2022-12-10 08:21:47] <levstk> @Rexxig if you don't have any mods, then i'm not sure what could be the issue, but if your dwarves are injured then they need to drink water
[2022-12-10 08:22:07] <levstk> platinum warhammer
[2022-12-10 08:22:36] <@DemiOfDerp> Fresh materials
[2022-12-10 08:22:44] <FMGee_> Fey mood is almost certainly gonna result in dwarf skull mugs.
[2022-12-10 08:22:49] <Call_me_ishmail> yeah. Macabre moods just look for materials. fell moods will kill you
[2022-12-10 08:22:57] <Rexxig> @Rexxig ok it makes sense since most of them were injured and I have no water available, thanks!

[2022-12-10 08:27:54] <levstk> did a bunch of merchants die or what?
[2022-12-10 08:28:05] <levstk> or is it now proximity based?
[2022-12-10 08:28:21] <%+Xenophanes420> I assume distance to neighbours matter for migrants?
[2022-12-10 08:28:35] <levstk> well, if merchants keep going missing at your fort, migration will stop

[2022-12-10 08:29:30] <Tacolishish> since the game predates multithreading thats the practical limit
[2022-12-10 08:29:41] <levstk> well, the default population is 200
[2022-12-10 08:29:45] <TNSe_> no vampires, overzealous necrolords, acid rain or abyss monsters?
[2022-12-10 08:29:50] <levstk> so it's meant to be a small town, sort of
[2022-12-10 08:29:51] <FMGee_> @Luam_the_elf It starts off as a small settlement manager, then it becomes a city manager, then a city defence simulator.
[2022-12-10 08:29:55] <TNSe_> just boring plain easy game this time?
[2022-12-10 08:29:56] <levstk> but you can raise the limit
[2022-12-10 08:30:32] <levstk> i mean, it's a defence simulator from the moment you reach 50 dwarves or export an artifact LUL

[2022-12-10 09:40:41] <+ranger225500> i think there is a trait that can break walls?

[2022-12-10 09:42:21] <%EntropicRadar> that's tame for dwarf fortress, tbh xD

[2022-12-10 09:42:52] <%EntropicRadar> nah, not really. or if it is, it cuts both ways, your dwarves can do the same stupidity.

[2022-12-10 09:46:19] <CapitanBlondBeard> there's a use for the vampire mayor someone had lol
[2022-12-10 09:46:20] <K0R3U> Pitfalls with snakes, are the most effective way to deter robbers.
[2022-12-10 09:46:26] <K0R3U> Hi @Pandora_Starbreeze :)
[2022-12-10 09:46:42] <lord__tillion> there is the old classic of using a pitfall to keep a forgotten beast that can't climb or fly as a pet
[2022-12-10 09:46:50] <+ranger225500> pitfall full of snake venom and spikes would also work
[2022-12-10 09:47:13] <@DemiOfDerp> If it's tall enough all you need is the pitfall
[2022-12-10 09:47:15] <K0R3U> Yes. But then they can't go: "Why does it always have to be snakes"
[2022-12-10 09:47:17] <Ruevie> I assume you can make a pitfall trap that is basically like falling down a lava tube and just drop them into the deep depths of the earth?
[2022-12-10 09:47:24] <CapitanBlondBeard> pitfall full of all the dwarven tax returns to bore them to death?

[2022-12-10 09:57:42] <CapitanBlondBeard> dwarf fortress isnt a game, it's an interactive story generator. your job is to watch the story unfold, and do your best to delay the inevitable doom of every dwarf. then dust off your hands and start a new fort, and maybe if your lucky try to reclaim your old home

[2022-12-10 09:58:06] <1440pee> a succesful dwarf fortress is when you dig too deep and awaken a balrog
[2022-12-10 09:58:32] <AvocadoWitchKnits> Good luck with work @darkestdodo :D
[2022-12-10 09:58:38] <$InfernDragon> Though Success is depending on what goal you set yourself
[2022-12-10 09:58:39] <+ranger225500> once you can control the "circus" and defeat all the "clowns" after opening up the "candy" spires i call that a win
[2022-12-10 09:58:40] <$Kassious_88> @ToasterPig2346 I'm in the same boat! Aavak and Rimworld.. bad combo for me getting to bed!
[2022-12-10 09:58:40] <Tacolishish> the true way to win dwarf fortress is to make an impregnable fortress full of mechanisms, and strange contraptions, only to lose it to a tantrum spiral
[2022-12-10 09:58:49] <+Seanskillingg> Greetings @Aavak can you explain how you used the bins for storage?
[2022-12-10 09:58:54] <CapitanBlondBeard> I like the idea that a successful fortress is one with an ale filled swimming pool and waterfall

[2022-12-10 10:10:05] <Debris_Field> is it a wig or a crown?
[2022-12-10 10:10:13] <kenken244> what changed about stairs?

[2022-12-10 10:10:36] <@DemiOfDerp> They like their pork long
[2022-12-10 10:10:43] <$InfernDragon> Vampires tend to wear bone stuff

[2022-12-10 10:11:00] <CapitanBlondBeard> I mean, it's like drinking from the skulls of your enemies, but a bit more chic
[2022-12-10 10:11:10] <+Glodwran468> Honestly, knowing some humans myself, that's just par for the course.

[2022-12-10 10:13:58] <kenken244> therefore anything made of walnut is a crown
[2022-12-10 10:13:59] <%Starmage> usually sorting by "finished goods bins" is where your crowns and crafts are
[2022-12-10 10:14:08] <kenken244> its perfectly logical. maybe not sensible. but logical
[2022-12-10 10:14:09] <@DemiOfDerp> It might be bringing up all the walnut crates because one of them had a crown
[2022-12-10 10:14:15] <CapitanBlondBeard> at least df is roleplaying correctly as a dwarf. drunk and stubborn

[2022-12-10 10:33:07] <%Starmage> maybe a migrant moves from the same area (civ) to your place.. and a immigrant is one who moves from outside ?
[2022-12-10 10:33:09] <$Bredstiq> immigration comes naturally, migration comes forced. At least thats what I understand from it
[2022-12-10 10:33:09] <matteuus337> immigrant is someone who migrates in a nation?
[2022-12-10 10:33:10] <@DemiOfDerp> immigrant indicates that they arrive from somewhere. emigrants that they move from somewhere. and migrants are just moving
[2022-12-10 10:33:11] <%Briandh> Immigrants are coming to stay, migrants are passing through
[2022-12-10 10:33:12] <%BloodyFalcan> and ones from outside the country, I think

[2022-12-10 10:33:31] <+Venaliter> immigrant is moving in. emmigrant is moving out.

[2022-12-10 10:33:32] <exotau> Migrant = temporary movement Immigrant = permanent residency
[2022-12-10 10:33:34] <%Kyle_Dornez> Emigrants go away Imigrants come in Migrants just go
[2022-12-10 10:33:36] <%deryck1228> An immigrant is someone who moves into an area, an emigrant is one who moves out, a migrant is one who moves about an area
[2022-12-10 10:33:41] <Pineapple0837> "The word migrant refers to someone who moves to other places in search of work or better living conditions. The word immigrant refers to those who have moved to foreign countries permanently for work or for better living conditions. It can be used both as a Noun and an Adjective." what I found in google
[2022-12-10 10:33:41] <Nemesis688> Migrant means they moved for work
[2022-12-10 10:33:41] <lord__tillion> one is leaving your country the other is entering
[2022-12-10 10:33:44] <%RoadTrain_> @Aavak seems like migrants are moving through

[2022-12-10 11:29:11] <K0R3U> Is the engraving kinda like runes from Warhamer fantasy?

[2022-12-10 11:31:44] <AkiraDragonborne> @Aavak I saw purpleish swirlies in the fort. Was that Miasma?
[2022-12-10 11:31:55] <%+Worgensnack> @Aavak could it be that there isn't anywhere else set for teeth?

[2022-12-10 11:35:17] <K0R3U> Have you turned off the sound Aavak, or is the game just kinda silent?
[2022-12-10 11:35:37] <lastofthelivingundeads> @Matkinson159 No, dwarven cheese is made with milk obtained from purring maggots.

[2022-12-10 11:35:50] <%KnightlyProphet> at least there is no screaming bird
[2022-12-10 11:35:59] <CapitanBlondBeard> What ive seen a few people do is turn off music in game, then play music from the soundtrack seperately so its continuous
[2022-12-10 11:36:02] <Dwarfy2k> The new music is neat though

[2022-12-10 11:36:46] <CapitanBlondBeard> @Matkinson159 but it also raises the theory that Purring Maggots are the precursors of the modern Dwarven race
[2022-12-10 11:37:06] <CapitanBlondBeard> So Dwarves would be milking their pre evolved selves
[2022-12-10 11:37:18] <elhazzared1> freudian slip
[2022-12-10 11:37:24] <Dwarfy2k> I'll be happy to try out the "new" adventurer mode when it comes

[2022-12-10 11:47:13] <Fireshark42> some of the animals got implemented on behalf of early donators
[2022-12-10 11:47:30] <Streamleren> limited? tell that to my dwarves fighting kitten skins yesterday
[2022-12-10 11:47:35] <%Starmage> there will be more magic and such updates at some point in the future
[2022-12-10 11:47:39] <CapitanBlondBeard> Alot of people like putting objects descriptions into AI generators
[2022-12-10 11:47:51] <wilko710> im thinking about getting the game but  i havent had much expereince in games like these would u reccomend
[2022-12-10 11:48:18] VIEWERS: 1 347
[2022-12-10 11:48:33] <Dwarfy2k> I'd recommend worst case just do a steam refund
[2022-12-10 11:48:48] <+Pocketonion> @wilko710 I have very little experience in these types of games and dwarf fortress has been kind of addicting with the new UI
[2022-12-10 11:49:07] <wilko710> alright im getting it
[2022-12-10 11:49:11] <%+Dunkurtin> Thats bad advice, this game takes way too long to learn to decide in steam refund time if you like it
[2022-12-10 11:49:13] <+Komodokov> @wilko710 the wiki has plenty of beginner help
[2022-12-10 11:49:17] <%Starmage> you click the engraved tiles no?
[2022-12-10 11:49:26] <%+Dunkurtin> If you dont get too easily frustrated its worth it
[2022-12-10 11:49:31] <Dwarfy2k> @Dunkurtin With the tutorial now though you'll know pretty quick
[2022-12-10 11:49:43] <%RoadTrain_> @Starmage he wants an indicator to tell him which tiles are 'engraved'.
[2022-12-10 11:49:51] <%RoadTrain_> Mostly for walls
[2022-12-10 11:49:58] <wilko710> @Komodokov thanks
[2022-12-10 11:50:00] <%RoadTrain_> Because you can't see if they're engraved.
[2022-12-10 11:50:05] <%Starmage> hmm... i doubt ther eis such a "overlay"
[2022-12-10 11:50:12] <CapitanBlondBeard> I have seen the option somewhere on someone elses stream, unsure if its what you need or where it was LUL im less than helpful i know, but something does exist
[2022-12-10 11:50:19] VIEWERS: 1 347
[2022-12-10 11:50:24] <AkiraDragonborne> I saw an option called Engravings start obscured. If that helps at all.
[2022-12-10 11:50:29] <CapitanBlondBeard> ^
[2022-12-10 11:50:35] <+dArchAngel1> You have it set in the list as engraving show = No
[2022-12-10 11:50:40] <K0R3U> Wrinkles are nothing that some good dwarven beer can't fix.
[2022-12-10 11:50:42] <Dwarfy2k> As for the engraved I'm not sure. So many of the options like that are hidden in nook and crannies, one of my few complaints
[2022-12-10 11:50:44] <Skuuka> Don't engraved walls have a slightly different sprite? Like, a couple of extra dots
[2022-12-10 11:51:10] <+the__kazz> I played the classic version with a UI mod and visual overhaul mod that made it look very similar to this.
[2022-12-10 11:51:22] <%+Worgensnack> personally I'm giving it a few weeks before I pick it up, both to let some patches go through, and so I can just use christmas money for it
[2022-12-10 11:51:35] <+the__kazz> though it still didn't have mouse support
[2022-12-10 11:51:58] <Dwarfy2k> I'm vastly enjoying the mouse aspect, like advanced Dungeon Keeper now :P

[2022-12-10 12:43:40] <%Starmage> @polo96_ yea, this steam version is the most acessible compared to the classic ascii one...  just have fun building things and figureing stuff out. and dont be sad if everyone dies :D   just make a new outpost and see what happens.
[2022-12-10 12:43:48] <Kampfnudel34> You break the law, the law breaks you?
[2022-12-10 12:43:52] <kuterian> the marksdwarf training is better now?
[2022-12-10 12:43:55] <+A404notfound> hammering is an effective punishment
[2022-12-10 12:44:02] <R00gle> cant you assign him a horrible hammer as a weapon ?
[2022-12-10 12:44:03] <+ranger225500> you want a light material hammer
[2022-12-10 12:44:18] <%kaijuwrangler> bringin down the hammer of justice
[2022-12-10 12:44:36] <Oskatatv2> weren't they supposed to fix the lethality of the hammerer by now?

[2022-12-10 12:44:44] <+ranger225500> its the punishment of the gods if you die you were really guilty
[2022-12-10 12:44:44] <Lista_Marafay> *usually* yup, is a actual thing in this game I bet...
[2022-12-10 12:44:45] <Kampfnudel34> these dwarfs can get good enough to throw CHEESE hard enough to kill.....giving them BAD equipment, does not make them safer @R00gle
[2022-12-10 12:44:49] <DrTeaSpoon> Have they improved the world generation in the retail version or does it still take 5 hours to generate any reasonable amount of history?
[2022-12-10 12:44:54] <R00gle> Kampfnudel34 lulw
[2022-12-10 12:44:59] <PureSpider> @DrTeaSpoon MUCH improved
[2022-12-10 12:45:15] <Veintidos> Zones can overlap?
[2022-12-10 12:45:17] <DrTeaSpoon> Good :)
[2022-12-10 12:45:31] <Oskatatv2> @DrTeaSpoon although, what do you consider a reasonable amount?
[2022-12-10 12:45:32] <Lista_Marafay> you could sau it was a gouda throw? durdle2Face
[2022-12-10 12:45:37] <AkiraDragonborne> @Aavak It should be the other way around. When the Hammerer gets good at their job, you WISH they were still bad enough to end you accidentally.
[2022-12-10 12:45:39] <+ranger225500> you can throw a fluffy warmbler hard enough to break off a bronze colossus's head
[2022-12-10 12:45:47] <$kerrjo> I never played the original DF, this looks very Rimworldesque, do you think someone familiar with Rimworld would have any problems the new Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-10 12:46:02] <PureSpider> @kerrjo it's very different from rimworld
[2022-12-10 12:46:22] <dQuintosh> @kerrjo it has much more depth and a LOT more crafting options, and the inventory menus etc arent as accessible as rimworld
[2022-12-10 12:46:27] <PureSpider> this focuses much more on the macro aspects of the fort, not micro-managing five people
[2022-12-10 12:46:29] <%Starmage> its fun though to build a starter outpost near the surface.. and once you digg deeper you build a new base further down, more grand and fancy.... and then even deeper another new base later.
[2022-12-10 12:46:31] <feuerwind> Hammerers should be leathal. Usually they only hammer muderers and vampires. To get hammered by the hammerer, you need to be sentenced to death. Random hammering only occours when the hammerer is the only force of justice in the fort.

[2022-12-10 12:46:55] <+ranger225500> and if you live your seen as pardened by the god
[2022-12-10 12:47:19] <$kerrjo> Thanks for the replies guys <3
[2022-12-10 12:47:46] <+niedellan> nooooo,  but i just arrived WutFace
[2022-12-10 12:47:50] <Oskatatv2> @kerrjo yes. I mean, the UI is about as clunky as rimworld, only useful when you know it, but the focus on the game is very different. More focus on being a manager and far less direct control
[2022-12-10 12:47:59] <%BloodyFalcan> "today is a sad day, rather then from the outside the first murder came from within the fort"
[2022-12-10 12:48:04] <AkiraDragonborne> o/ Take care @Aavak Thanks for the stream.
[2022-12-10 12:48:17] <Glasst1ger> i just lost a hundred dwarves to a slug forgotten beast
