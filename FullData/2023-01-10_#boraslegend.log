[2023-01-10 16:24:00] <@%^Nightbot> For Boras to review your squad, you must donate at least $6 or 600 bits, or save up for 150,000 channel points. Please include your budget and ingame formation! (Preferably FUTBIN). He will ONLY do squad reviews from Monday to Thursday! NO squad reviews on Friday, Saturday or Sunday!

[2023-01-10 18:57:39] <@%trilungpark> !lazio
[2023-01-10 18:57:39] <@%^Nightbot> Boras supports Lazio because they came to his home town in Sweden in a pre-season tour to play against his local team. When Boras saw all of Lazio's legendary players and the best Scandinavian manager in history (SGE) at the helm, he couldn't help but fall in love with Lazio.
