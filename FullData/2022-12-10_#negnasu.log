[2022-12-10 06:31:55] <LuacProg> ou are not allowed to read books on Twitch. Similar to music, many books are copyrighted and unless you own the copyright to the book, or are given permission from the owner of the copyright to read the book on stream, you are breaking the law and may receive a DMCA takedown
[2022-12-10 06:31:58] <%+soulwillin1997> yeah if that's the case then it should be illegal for Teachers to read textbooks to you
[2022-12-10 06:31:59] <@%kyuu_P> Fanfics? No.
[2022-12-10 06:32:13] <Chriall> I think it should be fine if you have a filter over it

[2022-12-10 06:32:18] <%NekoDemon76> kohiatPOG
[2022-12-10 06:32:19] <$Andinyan> It’s not illegal to read books provided that you don’t show the text.

[2022-12-10 06:32:28] <!%MakoFukasame> For most part, you won't be DMCA'd unless they care, and most people also err on the side of caution

[2022-12-10 06:32:58] <%Hyper_Sonic__> Yes but
[2022-12-10 06:33:00] <!%MakoFukasame> You technically can't stream games
[2022-12-10 06:33:05] <!%MakoFukasame> Streaming games is also illegal
[2022-12-10 06:33:06] <MilleniaAntares> It's not plagiarism if you acknowledge that it isn't yours

[2022-12-10 06:33:20] <$shypotatoboy> Back from work
[2022-12-10 06:33:22] <%Hyper_Sonic__> So it's kind of a gray area
[2022-12-10 06:33:24] <!%MakoFukasame> But it's an unwritten rule that you just don't copyright strike people
[2022-12-10 06:33:25] <MilleniaAntares> Keep in mind that you have to be reported in order to get in troubld
[2022-12-10 06:33:33] <Chriall> No more game streams
[2022-12-10 06:33:38] <$shypotatoboy> I would be more enthusiastic but I’m crawling at the end of this work day.
[2022-12-10 06:33:38] <%$RTSAvalanche> I do know a couple VTubers that read books for streams - how ever they read old short stories (that are no in the free domain -no copy right)
[2022-12-10 06:33:45] <@%kyuu_P> Yeah, since you want people to see your games. Only Atlus does that.
[2022-12-10 06:33:47] <MilleniaAntares> You're pretty obscure so you can be safe.
[2022-12-10 06:33:47] <$Andinyan> Yeah, it’s winked at as long as you aren’t presenting it as yours#
[2022-12-10 06:33:47] <!%MakoFukasame> Twitch's entire premise is based on copyright infringement going off the letter of the law
[2022-12-10 06:33:56] <%NekoDemon76> I know a streamer read game of thrones on stream
[2022-12-10 06:33:58] <!%MakoFukasame> but the law isn't usually followed that exactly
[2022-12-10 06:34:16] <@%kyuu_P> The fan translation!
[2022-12-10 06:34:22] <%+percival_sparkletrout> that makes it a public work ,yeah?

[2022-12-10 06:35:26] <$Andinyan> Hololive or other big streamers probably wouldn’t do it without permission to avoid the risk of someone suing.
[2022-12-10 06:35:31] <LuacProg> copyright laws are a mess
[2022-12-10 06:35:48] <!%MakoFukasame> Yeah copyright law is a mess and whether or not something falls into fair use is so subjective
[2022-12-10 06:35:49] <$shypotatoboy> With how this month is going so far, I think I can be dubbed as mashed potatoes…

[2022-12-10 06:35:59] <@%kyuu_P> Oh, you probably don't know. Three Days of Happiness got an official English translation published by Yen Press in 2020.
[2022-12-10 06:36:05] <!%MakoFukasame> If your content is 'transformative' then it counts
[2022-12-10 06:36:18] <%NekoDemon76> Copyright needs to be updated to make things like this more clear
