[2022-12-10 05:43:37] <%+plagueddegeneracy> I wish I could develop a love for vegetables but it's scientifically proven that our taste comes from ancestors vegetables don't taste good to some people because we haven't evolved as much since vegetables didn't have much substance as food compared to meat/sweets/etc
[2022-12-10 05:43:47] <%imperatorsatanas> I may be biased because I cannot have milk but yeah just sounds wacky

[2022-12-10 06:33:47] <$Andinyan> Yeah, it‚Äôs winked at as long as you aren‚Äôt presenting it as yours#
[2022-12-10 06:33:47] <!%MakoFukasame> Twitch's entire premise is based on copyright infringement going off the letter of the law
[2022-12-10 06:33:56] <%NekoDemon76> I know a streamer read game of thrones on stream
[2022-12-10 06:33:58] <!%MakoFukasame> but the law isn't usually followed that exactly
[2022-12-10 06:34:16] <@%kyuu_P> The fan translation!

[2022-12-10 06:34:54] <$shypotatoboy> THIS MONTH HAS NOT BEEN SO POTATO FRIENDLY.
[2022-12-10 06:34:58] <Chriall> Wouldn't fan translations be worse, "Not supporting the official release"
[2022-12-10 06:35:03] <@%kyuu_P> So, don't read *the book* Read the short story. josabeNodders

[2022-12-10 06:35:26] <$Andinyan> Hololive or other big streamers probably wouldn‚Äôt do it without permission to avoid the risk of someone suing.
[2022-12-10 06:35:31] <LuacProg> copyright laws are a mess
[2022-12-10 06:35:48] <!%MakoFukasame> Yeah copyright law is a mess and whether or not something falls into fair use is so subjective

[2022-12-10 06:36:05] <!%MakoFukasame> If your content is 'transformative' then it counts
[2022-12-10 06:36:18] <%NekoDemon76> Copyright needs to be updated to make things like this more clear
[2022-12-10 06:36:22] <!%MakoFukasame> i.e. all the biggest streamers are committing copyright infringement all day everyday
