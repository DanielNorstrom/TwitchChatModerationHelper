[2022-12-10 18:54:25] <%Razielvj> reset cycle to 0
[2022-12-10 18:54:28] <TheIrishGuy> set cycle 0
[2022-12-10 18:54:32] <Nerudeus> 41 is not 1
[2022-12-10 18:54:34] <%cmmeth> cyce need to reset after each line
[2022-12-10 18:54:34] <@%^Moobot> You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2022-12-10 18:54:38] <$fells> because that's how it works.
[2022-12-10 18:54:39] <%chochi314> In "render" function replace "current_cycle" with "(current_cycle % 40)"
[2022-12-10 18:54:41] <+Papatim68> cyle += after newline check
[2022-12-10 18:54:45] <%Razielvj> register never goes avobee 39
[2022-12-10 18:54:54] <+dpokerdude> that
[2022-12-10 18:54:59] <neighbourovi> can we see render?
[2022-12-10 18:55:00] <TheIrishGuy> just to desplay it
[2022-12-10 18:55:00] <%Smithii> Don't reset cycle. But scoot over the pixels. Pixel 0-39 in each line
[2022-12-10 18:55:12] <Entrymissing> it's screen coordinates so you need to reset to 0
[2022-12-10 18:55:17] <%cmmeth> cycle != position
[2022-12-10 18:55:17] <$fells> each new line starts at 0. and you compare the value of cycle N with the position in the line.
[2022-12-10 18:55:31] <+stormblaz> do it
[2022-12-10 18:55:36] <neighbourovi> GG

[2022-12-10 18:56:25] <@%$Apparentthreat> so it makes sense that it resets
[2022-12-10 18:56:27] <neighbourovi> @Giantwaffle did you do the yesterday problem?
[2022-12-10 18:56:27] <Myekos> no, imagine setting up that problem from reverse

[2022-12-10 18:59:49] <%DaemonSzyman> Thats pretty sick gameplay for a ps3
[2022-12-10 18:59:53] <Tiny_Goliath> you should show the first boss battle for that
[2022-12-10 19:00:00] <%$Mandorake> that sounds sick
[2022-12-10 19:00:09] <WalrusPug> prbably more sekiro than souls
[2022-12-10 19:00:14] <%DX_Plates> @ninopanda Bruh when I left Eve I was doing dread bombs. Dropping dreads into enemy territory trying to kill a super. 10B isk that is a one one jump most likely
[2022-12-10 19:00:24] <+stormblaz> like healthy leaks or shady leaks
[2022-12-10 19:00:51] <%DaemonSzyman> Kinda war thunder tank style?

[2022-12-10 19:02:15] <%DX_Plates> ninopanda Yea my Titan actually got blow up, but there was a server error and I was in two systems at the same time. When I exited the jump tunnel I was alive, but I have a kill report in another system.

[2022-12-10 19:03:24] <@%ninopanda> @OrangeW2 dude if you seen my code for today, you would throw up.  it is soooo bad
[2022-12-10 19:03:26] <%maccabeus> @DX_Plates that was a hell of a night, I was one of the guys who never made it through in the first place

[2022-12-10 19:03:36] <%DX_Plates> @ninopanda It was a one time thing, the larest Titan battle in the game. We jump in so many ship we desync'd the entire node.

[2022-12-10 19:34:20] <suikerfeestje> 1 ad section or only 1 seperate ad?
[2022-12-10 19:34:22] <%DaemonSzyman> I heard they change those contracts pretty often, is that right?
[2022-12-10 19:34:23] <+stormblaz> 1 ad is very low ad density
[2022-12-10 19:34:26] <%$Mandorake> time for TOP OF THE HOUR ad
[2022-12-10 19:34:26] <%+Thegrinch6> we would support you
[2022-12-10 19:34:33] <%+thecodealive_original> won't you need a pipe splitter or new water pump?

[2022-12-10 19:34:37] <$Stillglade> that is honestly one of the reasons I love this stream
[2022-12-10 19:34:38] <+stormblaz> AHAH Bait and switch
[2022-12-10 19:34:42] <%+J0hanAndersson> @Mandorake azan stream? lysSus
[2022-12-10 19:34:43] <%brewerdc> Some streamers have like 8 ads ever 20 minutes
[2022-12-10 19:34:44] <Sotales> as long as it isn't a 1, 5 minute ad
[2022-12-10 19:34:45] <ehsanpo> HeyGuys
[2022-12-10 19:34:48] <suikerfeestje> You have 2k watchers regular so i guess they want it

[2022-12-10 19:34:57] <Caritien> At least you have the balls to say no. One of my more favorable streamers sold out for ads to just play automatically

[2022-12-10 19:35:00] <ProtazLV> @Giantwaffle any plans to play Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-10 19:35:01] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-10 19:35:05] <%LUCIFER_RA> up to 2 min per hour is manageable
[2022-12-10 19:35:10] <+Cpt_Golfz> waffleSPINFASTER
[2022-12-10 19:35:11] <+Frogg_butt> would you be able to choose when the ad would be played or would it be random once per hour?
[2022-12-10 19:35:12] <%$Mandorake> a certain other website does that and its fine
[2022-12-10 19:35:12] <+Kudasauce> I just don't understand why Twitch doesn't embrace different ad techniques like skips, banners, etc
[2022-12-10 19:35:12] <bambulehto> did hydroneer get farming update?!
[2022-12-10 19:35:15] <suikerfeestje> More people who f5 till they have a 5sec skip add on YT?
[2022-12-10 19:35:15] <YourLittlePuppy> yeah, that would be cool
[2022-12-10 19:35:18] <Caritien> I'd rather have a banner under the video pop up.
[2022-12-10 19:35:20] <ReubenlI> i hate the add blocks the whole stream
[2022-12-10 19:35:21] <+stormblaz> well, ads that you skip yr makes nothing
[2022-12-10 19:35:22] <Amraki> silent ads on the side wouldn't be so bad
[2022-12-10 19:35:25] <%Karnaxx> Turbo is the real solution
[2022-12-10 19:35:26] <%$Mandorake> @Kudasauce they do banner ads
[2022-12-10 19:35:32] <daedraheartcollector> YT premium is wonderfull
[2022-12-10 19:35:33] <+stormblaz> if you skip the ad cost is removed
[2022-12-10 19:35:34] <%DaemonSzyman> to be fair, lately youtube ads have been crazy. Been getting double 20 second unskippable ads
[2022-12-10 19:35:34] <suikerfeestje> They have banner adds
[2022-12-10 19:35:38] <ba_nanananananana> give me banner ads any day. But missing out on content is idiotic
[2022-12-10 19:35:38] <xCC___> holy shit, i just unfollowed a streamer who was running like a 1 minute ad every 10 minutes
[2022-12-10 19:35:39] <%BadLa> banner ads on the video arent bad
[2022-12-10 19:35:43] <%LUCIFER_RA> there are banners showing up under the stream
[2022-12-10 19:35:45] <%+KamiSkript> @daedraheartcollector it is
[2022-12-10 19:35:45] <+stormblaz> yeap banner and sound only ads
[2022-12-10 19:35:51] <+Kudasauce> I've literally never seen those weird
[2022-12-10 19:35:51] <Aomtte> Banner add are often blocked
[2022-12-10 19:35:53] <+SlyBananaMan> I swear ads pop when you want to see what's happening next on stream like the plot twist of a game and an ad pops
[2022-12-10 19:35:55] <%+Jaded_Parrot> i think ads hurt the streamer in the long run as if you watch more than one streamer you may as well just get turbo which takes the sub away from the streamer especially if youre a lurker
[2022-12-10 19:35:59] <hisdue> chat ads where you have to spam the brand to get it to go away TrollDespair
[2022-12-10 19:35:59] <Francisco_Scaramanga> turbo
[2022-12-10 19:36:00] <bambulehto> did hydroneer update come out already chat?
[2022-12-10 19:36:04] <xymenez> just add the possibility to go back to where ad started
[2022-12-10 19:36:07] <%sam1390> I just hate that they keep showing me french ads cause im canadian but cant get them to stop
[2022-12-10 19:36:14] <ba_nanananananana> Twitch really managed to make video ads worse than TV.
[2022-12-10 19:36:15] <The_Holas> i hate that you get like 1-2 same ads every hours for like month or 2 ...
[2022-12-10 19:36:15] <%DaemonSzyman> Itchyyy
[2022-12-10 19:36:16] <suikerfeestje> @jaded_parrot + people dont join when they get greeted by a 8add break
[2022-12-10 19:36:16] <+Invariantly> @sam1390 haha same
[2022-12-10 19:36:17] <%$Mandorake> no itchy
[2022-12-10 19:36:20] <Chasemi> imagine not having adblock in 2022
[2022-12-10 19:36:34] <%$Mandorake> @Chasemi when adblock breaks its so annoying
[2022-12-10 19:36:34] <satyasann> caturday? milton is back? PauseChamp
[2022-12-10 19:36:40] <%+DDPrime> they need to fix the volume. I watch you as background, loud ads are the main reasons I got adblock
[2022-12-10 19:36:41] <%+Jaded_Parrot> i straight up leave a streamer if i get mid roll ads
[2022-12-10 19:36:51] <%LUCIFER_RA> i google stupid things i don't need just so they keep giving me ads for it danEvil waste your money
[2022-12-10 19:37:09] <AmericanTax> It's 1:2 rounded up?
[2022-12-10 19:37:11] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> watering can is the first thing I would buy with the tokens
[2022-12-10 19:37:11] <Amenophiz> 1.15 is 2 1.38 is 3
[2022-12-10 19:37:18] <+Gh0st1979> X 2 rounded up
[2022-12-10 19:37:18] <%brewerdc> Each mater is different
[2022-12-10 19:37:24] <%+Jaded_Parrot> mid roll ads on live content just baffles me as a model
[2022-12-10 19:37:27] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> 3 is the value
[2022-12-10 19:37:33] <Amenophiz> from x to Y wieth is 1 coin
[2022-12-10 19:37:43] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> seriously I wouldnt sell them, only do quests for the tokens
[2022-12-10 19:37:46] <+Frogg_butt> Maybe it's like between 2 numbers
[2022-12-10 19:37:50] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> they only grow once
[2022-12-10 19:37:51] <%$Mandorake> tomatos should keep growing
[2022-12-10 19:38:04] <%$Mandorake> based on real life
[2022-12-10 19:38:04] <%chochi314> It can be 1H per 0.5 and than rounded
[2022-12-10 19:38:08] <glove_17> tomato keep producing
[2022-12-10 19:38:19] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> I havent seen a tomato plant produce more than once
[2022-12-10 19:38:22] <%thestoicjohn> half pond to 1 and rounded to nearest half?
[2022-12-10 19:38:46] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> I have left a tomato plant grow for like an hour after harvesting and never got another harvest
[2022-12-10 19:38:47] <Amraki> clicky clacky
[2022-12-10 19:38:59] <%Renny_S> no you dont

[2022-12-10 19:39:13] <%Tenkaichi500> agreed
[2022-12-10 19:39:13] <Amraki> just get another mic just for keyboard

[2022-12-10 19:39:42] <%Allmostdone> just get an app that makes the keyboard sound
[2022-12-10 19:39:43] <%+slyjedi> Didnât u put bands on your keys?
[2022-12-10 19:39:43] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> sometimes a tomato will give you 2 seeds
[2022-12-10 19:39:47] <%+grandmaMax> It's FARMIN SEASON! Looking forward to seeing a large farm in a few hours
[2022-12-10 19:39:53] <Myekos> yes
[2022-12-10 19:39:54] <%DaemonSzyman> ye
[2022-12-10 19:39:59] <%Beufff> so is this farm sim now and no more mining?
[2022-12-10 19:40:05] <%$Mandorake> PogChamp dev
[2022-12-10 19:40:12] <The_Holas> i bet its down
[2022-12-10 19:40:19] <%+grandmaMax> Uh, its rounded to nearest int. You can stack up multiple cut veg piles
[2022-12-10 19:40:25] <half_winged_devil> it could be 9,4
[2022-12-10 19:40:27] <Myekos> add 10 to find out
[2022-12-10 19:40:50] <%+grandmaMax> Yeah, you need to cut them down. Maybe use a few veg to spawn more seed bags with the mill
[2022-12-10 19:40:54] <Aomtte> 2 carrots yes
[2022-12-10 19:40:58] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> TOLD YOU!
[2022-12-10 19:41:18] <%+grandmaMax> Seed bags also can stack together for easy transportation :D
[2022-12-10 19:41:39] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> max, why is the sprinkler so damn expensive?
[2022-12-10 19:41:46] <suikerfeestje> So in this case you get 2carrots profit for each one planted
[2022-12-10 19:41:53] <%+grandmaMax> Funny that - you've gotta *farm* the seed bags in the farming update
[2022-12-10 19:41:55] <%DaemonSzyman> Theres a reddit for that
[2022-12-10 19:41:57] <Caech> cbt
[2022-12-10 19:41:58] <%42424242424242424242> put your hand in there NOW

[2022-12-10 19:42:08] <%+grandmaMax> I also hope the irony isn't lost on anyone that we released a farming update.... in the middle of winter.

[2022-12-10 19:45:08] <%TimeShift_Gaming> @pavalolo yes

[2022-12-10 19:45:34] <%Winstonrocks> did you water your plants?
[2022-12-10 19:45:38] <%TimeShift_Gaming> Woah, reply is broke. didn't show I actually replied until I sent another message
[2022-12-10 19:46:00] <Amenophiz> can you set a drip over the plants for auto water ?
[2022-12-10 19:46:27] <%+grandmaMax> The watering can can do multiple, or a sprinkler. Both purchasable with tokens
[2022-12-10 19:46:38] <%+grandmaMax> I'll stop backseating now
[2022-12-10 19:46:57] <suikerfeestje> Why do you have that water setup Waffle?

[2022-12-10 19:47:42] <YourLittlePuppy> why to use a case at this point LUL

[2022-12-10 19:47:43] <@%$Apparentthreat> my noctua air cooler almost didn't fit in my case pepeLaugh
[2022-12-10 19:47:49] <HippoFromAquarium> airflow can be issue LUL
[2022-12-10 19:47:57] <Flaaf> That's what I'm gonna do, except using a dremel on the GPU back panel plate instead, saving my case @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-10 19:48:00] <%+grandmaMax> Where is tip button?
[2022-12-10 19:48:21] <Amraki> *waffle is not responding*
[2022-12-10 19:48:37] <+Mfdtgamer> cant you just take the backplate off?
[2022-12-10 19:48:43] <HippoFromAquarium> but why using dremel on back plate?  when you take it off
[2022-12-10 19:48:47] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> @grandmaMax is yield effected by how often I water? like if I don't water them immediately will they produce less?

[2022-12-10 19:49:00] <%+grandmaMax> @BrokeAsAJoke88 nope
[2022-12-10 19:49:03] <%Allmostdone> why use a case at all. Just build the compuer into a desk

[2022-12-10 19:49:28] <Flaaf> @Mfdtgamer If I take off the back panel plate I can't screw the gpu to lock it

[2022-12-10 19:54:22] <HostileLogOut> @Giantwaffle ngl not that many people want to optimize their models and wont pay lol.
[2022-12-10 19:54:36] <%+xavier2119> that sounds awful lol
[2022-12-10 19:54:37] <@%$Apparentthreat> is one of those OrangeW2
[2022-12-10 19:54:51] <RoninStorm> a real business in the future... that's gonna be a HUGE industry
[2022-12-10 19:54:53] <HostileLogOut> honestly depends on how deep you want to go.
[2022-12-10 19:54:57] <%OrangeW2> @Apparentthreat wat
[2022-12-10 19:55:03] <JamesySmithy> what's the benefit of the crops in this?
[2022-12-10 19:55:08] <HostileLogOut> try optimizing all models to like below 4 materials etc
[2022-12-10 19:55:11] <myMeshell> as a new player, this game is difficult to figure out how to do things
[2022-12-10 19:55:16] <@%$Apparentthreat> i dunno. i thought you helped waffle with some model stuff but maybe just randomly
[2022-12-10 19:55:25] <+kenshin2666> what kind of equipment does one need to do VR model optimizing
[2022-12-10 19:55:27] <Sotales> are the tomato plants too close together? not sure if that is a thing in this game

[2022-12-10 19:58:12] <RoflBlast> leave the shavings. they conduct electricity and will help your gpu to work faster
[2022-12-10 19:58:25] <+CorSPACE> shavings add 10hp KEKW
[2022-12-10 19:58:28] <%+xavier2119> I would wrap the gpu in a bag before dremeling. and tape the bag off where you are cutting. prevent all of that
[2022-12-10 19:58:28] <Flaaf> I tried bending it, but it didn't work. Oh, that's a good tip about the metal shavings, will definitely do that!

[2022-12-10 20:33:44] <Amenophiz> didnt the quest say chopped tomatoes in a bowl ?
[2022-12-10 20:33:59] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> you're not doing anything wrong, it takes a few
[2022-12-10 20:34:24] <BowTieGuy21> when you picked up the pot, it said in the bottom right you needed 3 vegetables
[2022-12-10 20:34:29] <BowTieGuy21> bottom left*
[2022-12-10 20:34:33] <%+HeyItIsMeMAC> a watched pot never boils
[2022-12-10 20:34:44] <%Smithii> Waffle already got those asbestos hands :D
[2022-12-10 20:34:59] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> you need a minimum of 3 i think is what it's saying
[2022-12-10 20:35:11] <Sotales> Smithii my dad has those, i swear. my hands are like the opposite though
[2022-12-10 20:35:26] <cyberhalo> itsaid 8 tomatos... not 8 pounds of tomTOS

[2022-12-10 20:35:58] <%Smithii> PauseChamp
[2022-12-10 20:35:59] <+sc2ninja> Re you sure it's not 8 tomatoes AND a bowl?

[2022-12-10 20:36:07] <+Shadowmail> @ajman225 nope, since leagues is getting owned I am done with it for a while
[2022-12-10 20:36:15] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> you cook it like that, then when it's done you pour it into a bowl
[2022-12-10 20:36:15] <%$Mandorake> maybe try pouring whtas out into a bowl
[2022-12-10 20:36:22] <%+HeyItIsMeMAC> Prayge
[2022-12-10 20:36:26] <dylan0806> Or 3 different vegetables
[2022-12-10 20:36:27] <+scary_shinigami> you need the finished part out @Giantwaffle with the bowl
[2022-12-10 20:36:32] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> @Giantwaffle there is something to be said about the red tomato outline.. that doesnt look right
[2022-12-10 20:36:41] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> I have been making soup all morning. you're doing it correctly
[2022-12-10 20:36:42] <+scary_shinigami> maybe
[2022-12-10 20:36:43] <+scary_shinigami> KEKW
[2022-12-10 20:36:56] <%$Mandorake> you took out the tomatos right when it cooked
[2022-12-10 20:37:00] <%theragul> @Giantwaffle Do the plants regrow or do you have to replant them after harvesting?
[2022-12-10 20:37:02] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> turn it in
[2022-12-10 20:37:04] <Amenophiz> 8 bouls of soup ?
[2022-12-10 20:37:28] <Amenophiz> maybe bowl content is limited like the dirt bucket ?
[2022-12-10 20:37:35] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> no, i think you cooked it without the game registering all the tomatoes
[2022-12-10 20:37:56] <%LidlFrog> the dirt adds flavor NODDERS
[2022-12-10 20:38:02] <Aldizzert> Huh, hunh?
[2022-12-10 20:38:10] <%$Mandorake> @BrokeAsAJoke88 he kept taking the tomatos out
[2022-12-10 20:38:19] <Aldizzert> Onyon?
[2022-12-10 20:38:30] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> i'm almost positive I just cooked a soup with one big stack of chopped tomatos
[2022-12-10 20:38:44] <%$Mandorake> im not convinced you need to chop the tomatoes into 3 parts
[2022-12-10 20:39:08] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> you get it back
[2022-12-10 20:39:15] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> when you turn in a quest
[2022-12-10 20:39:34] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> i told you hours ago not to sell the soup and turn it in for quests.. its worthless
[2022-12-10 20:39:43] <%LidlFrog> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-10 20:39:56] <Amenophiz> so soup is 8x price of raw tomato ?
[2022-12-10 20:40:07] <Ensirios> that just seems unfair tbh

[2022-12-10 22:07:01] <%+LtPayback> The Dutch goalie makes the same amount of money in a year that messi makes in a week
[2022-12-10 22:07:06] <+bismarcksd> Those poor soccer players get so many injuries Sadge
[2022-12-10 22:07:11] <Hamparty> baseball didnt have a cap for a while
[2022-12-10 22:07:11] <DoodpantsDude> it goes Messi, Mahomes, and Trout are top three
[2022-12-10 22:07:12] <@%+Nexhunter> baseball has long term large contracts
[2022-12-10 22:07:14] <%+forthereals> no salary cap
[2022-12-10 22:07:15] <madman10101> probably because they get rights to merch sales
[2022-12-10 22:07:16] <%banshay3> yeah but for how much work you do boxing fucks you up disproportionatly
[2022-12-10 22:07:19] <+consensual_ASMR> i mean didnt they release that ronaldo will charge a million for a insta post or something like that
[2022-12-10 22:07:22] <+timedoggg> all sports wear down the body, cataches up to ya eventually
[2022-12-10 22:07:22] <+AmericanMeat> Lebron James signed a 98 million two year contact it was his biggest per year sum
[2022-12-10 22:07:27] <RodriCraft93> Floyd is the highest, 300M in 2015
[2022-12-10 22:07:28] <Jamswhat2> did they do a big update?
[2022-12-10 22:07:28] <%Winstonrocks> for 2022 forbus said messi was highest payed at 130 million
[2022-12-10 22:07:29] <+Raffataff> FA said footballers can't/shouldn't head the ball the day before and after a match...
[2022-12-10 22:07:29] <That_monkey_guy> @Hamparty it still doesnt
[2022-12-10 22:07:30] <@%+Nexhunter> then it will be Mbappe
[2022-12-10 22:07:34] <@%+Nexhunter> who tops right now
[2022-12-10 22:07:34] <%Helo_KiX> oh yeah guess that's sorting by total not yearly
[2022-12-10 22:07:34] <Prefer2Lurk> baseball owners are billionaires who are willing to lose money to win games
[2022-12-10 22:07:40] <Hamparty> @That_monkey_guy wow KEKW
[2022-12-10 22:07:41] <%+gman0821> Ohtani probably going to get 13 year 500 mill

[2022-12-10 22:07:57] <creamcityjjw> baseball contracts are lare
[2022-12-10 22:07:59] <creamcityjjw> large

[2022-12-10 22:08:12] <%Winstonrocks> @Nexhunter hes listed at 128 million so im not sure?
[2022-12-10 22:08:21] <%+J0hanAndersson> saved
[2022-12-10 22:08:21] <%+DemonicHell3> Michael Jordan is the top all time if you adjust for inflation.
[2022-12-10 22:08:25] <@%+Nexhunter> @Winstonrocks stupid eruo conversion sainMad
[2022-12-10 22:08:25] <%+gman0821> it's crazy baseball contracts are so big when the sport is declining
[2022-12-10 22:08:34] <RodriCraft93> @Giantwaffle  its Floyd M for sure.  300M in 2015, 285M in 2018
[2022-12-10 22:08:37] <Hamparty> @That_monkey_guy ahhhh i knew something was done with salary at some point
[2022-12-10 22:08:40] <ShionSinX> that must be hot
[2022-12-10 22:08:56] <+erose914> An NFL team's salary cap next year is projected to be about $220 million for 53 players, which is a bit under 50% of the yearly average revenue per team
[2022-12-10 22:09:02] <@%+Nexhunter> @gman0821 162 game schedule so it is not a lot per game
[2022-12-10 22:09:09] <@%+Nexhunter> @gman0821 say compared to the NFL or something
[2022-12-10 22:09:21] <DoodpantsDude> @Giantwaffle messi is 168 mill a year, Mahomes is 41mil a year, and  Trout is 35 mil a year
[2022-12-10 22:09:29] <@%+Nexhunter> Messi isn't making 500m a year
[2022-12-10 22:09:31] <%+ike2ike> isn't there a sprinkler you can get?
[2022-12-10 22:09:32] <%+gman0821> @Nexhunter right, I agree but baseball is fully guaranteed unlike nfl
[2022-12-10 22:09:34] <@%+Nexhunter> his contract is like 130m a year
[2022-12-10 22:09:37] <$fells> There is a wikipedia article on this.

[2022-12-10 22:09:41] <+consensual_ASMR> brand endorsement is huge
[2022-12-10 22:09:44] <+Mykho_us> so many contracts have incentives as well
[2022-12-10 22:09:52] <RodriCraft93> messi is 130M in 2022, thats the highest he has ever been paid
[2022-12-10 22:09:53] <@%+Nexhunter> brand endorsement is not part of the contract to think about
[2022-12-10 22:09:54] <%kaos4666> sponsorships for dure
[2022-12-10 22:09:56] <Dirmit_McFargle> Messi's contract is less with PSG than Mbappe
[2022-12-10 22:09:57] <%kaos4666> sure*

[2022-12-10 22:10:05] <simoncs> Messis contract is 168.5 mil per year, the contract is a 5 year $674 mil
[2022-12-10 22:10:06] <Dirmit_McFargle> Messi made more this year because of a signing bonus

[2022-12-10 22:25:04] <@%+Nexhunter> @Larklen it more of skin cells and that jazz not drink for me
[2022-12-10 22:25:13] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> umm, can you plant on concrete?
[2022-12-10 22:25:36] <BoulderInDisguise> a cross pipe drips out of two sides
[2022-12-10 22:25:39] <mostlylaughing> I just relocated my build into a new case and cleaned all parts after like 2 years without maintenance KEKW clean cable management and hidden storage drives feel so good

[2022-12-10 22:27:05] <%+Jayouz> Ahhh right, I thought it was mine earlier so had to mute you stream to realise it was your end lol
[2022-12-10 22:27:06] <+BrokeAsAJoke88> waffle, you could use the T pipes upside down and feed them from above, it would allow you to more densly pack the plots
[2022-12-10 22:27:08] <@%+Nexhunter> @mostlylaughing yea I'm gonna have it on my desk this time instead of the floor NODDERS
[2022-12-10 22:27:36] <%+619srt> what fans/noise is your mic picking up than?
[2022-12-10 22:27:42] <%+Jayouz> @Nexhunter I want to move mine onto my desk but think I need a new desk that's a bit stronger lol

[2022-12-10 22:28:31] <%+em_t_hed> its the color of 70s computers
[2022-12-10 22:28:33] <+HoganIs2Cool> not rgb DansGame
[2022-12-10 22:28:34] <%zebadrabbit> i use them in my server, i dont see the doodie brown
[2022-12-10 22:28:39] <%+captain_chew> isnt the fractal torrent like $200?
[2022-12-10 22:28:41] <@%+Nexhunter> RGB stuff is meh
[2022-12-10 22:28:49] <RodriCraft93> true
[2022-12-10 22:28:50] <drsnaki96> imma sit here in the corner with my molex adaptor fans at max speed 24/7
[2022-12-10 22:28:51] <$Mr_Perril> bequiet are also good fans
[2022-12-10 22:29:05] <bambulehto> i think you are cool<3
[2022-12-10 22:29:06] <GhostPengy> I have one and I hate the color LUL
[2022-12-10 22:29:14] <Thurlas> i dont care for lights in the case
[2022-12-10 22:29:19] <RodriCraft93> I have RGB, never used it. Only some white light on the Asus motherboard
[2022-12-10 22:29:19] <+bismarcksd> 70% of the stream is waffle trying to put down a pallet
[2022-12-10 22:29:23] <@%+Nexhunter> https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/north/ look at this from fractal what I'm planning a new build in NODDERS  @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-10 22:29:25] <+Skornix> i have just a black case no clear sides
[2022-12-10 22:29:25] <%+Jayouz> Some LED's are nice if the inside of your computer looks nice
[2022-12-10 22:29:42] <Linkitch> As someone who dislikes RGB lights. It's actually a challenge to find a case without a glas panel side.
[2022-12-10 22:29:51] <%+captain_chew> Just give me a slick matte black/white build and I am happy
[2022-12-10 22:29:59] <%+619srt> rgb power supply cable to match build color looks sick imo
[2022-12-10 22:30:01] <$Mr_Perril> but Giantwaffle RGB gives 50% FPS boost & lower temps by 30c !
[2022-12-10 22:30:02] <Ahzuraki> i'm loving the lian li uni fans, the modular ones. not noctua silent but still pretty silent.
[2022-12-10 22:30:04] <@%+Nexhunter> tinted glass is nice
[2022-12-10 22:30:05] <!%LordHackett> I want to try a black light design
[2022-12-10 22:30:07] <%+Jayouz> @Linkitch Try Fractal, I have an R6 which comes with and without glass

[2022-12-10 22:30:17] <ShionSinX> I put tape over my KB's lights (like the caps and numlock ones), imagine having LEDs on the inside of the PC KEKW
