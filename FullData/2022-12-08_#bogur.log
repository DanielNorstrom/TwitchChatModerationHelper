[2022-12-08 12:15:03] <@%+PigeonWho> for once I actually dont hate this patch. I dont mind it. idk why everyone is losing their shit over it
[2022-12-08 12:15:09] <etgohome090> wait mercy got a buff?
[2022-12-08 12:15:42] <+outcloak> do tank players even like doomfist
[2022-12-08 12:15:44] <%+boxur47> and rammatra sucks cock and balls
[2022-12-08 12:16:07] <%+Guts72> Support players also crying cause they're playing a horror survival game now with doomfist coming after them
[2022-12-08 12:16:11] <+jambonbeurre_1> Tracer can one clip again LUL
[2022-12-08 12:16:12] <+killaBratMax> thing is most DF players didnt even ask for that buff, and blizz gona end up nerfbatting him to the shadow realm again anyways
[2022-12-08 12:16:13] <@%+PigeonWho> i think im just happy cause tracer got buffed and number of knives increased with kiriko

[2022-12-08 12:17:31] <+virginwizard1> like a genuine balanced nerf
[2022-12-08 12:17:33] <@%+PigeonWho> hold on, did they reduce visibility in a competitive game KEKW
[2022-12-08 12:17:41] <%Waizer> @killaBratMax that's the problem, they overtune him so much and then they'll annihilate him in the midseason... all the while hog will remain untouched I bet
[2022-12-08 12:17:46] <%+boxur47> @virginwizard1 dont nerf, rework the fuck out of him.
[2022-12-08 12:17:57] <%+boxur47> he doesnt fit in the game anymore
[2022-12-08 12:18:37] <%+boxur47> just hog and moira bcs like

[2022-12-08 12:21:05] <%+Guts72> @boxur47 Yeah I think they just need to make him easier to kill. Making his heal stationary like before would be fine
[2022-12-08 12:21:47] <%+boxur47> @Guts72 nah just make his damage reduction lower or whatever but even then it doesnt matter bcs kiriko is a healbot and she has cleanse so like sex

[2022-12-08 12:26:52] <@^Nightbot> Of course bogur has a circular window! You might think it is a bad architectural design a circular window seperating the bedroom from the kitchen but it actually serves a great purpose. It allows the person on the bed to view the people in the kitchen without all the smells and sounds coming through. The circular window motives bogur to get up, be happy, and play winston Monke

[2022-12-08 13:32:33] <%+ChrisTheRookey> !circularwindow
[2022-12-08 13:32:33] <@^Nightbot> Of course bogur has a circular window! You might think it is a bad architectural design a circular window seperating the bedroom from the kitchen but it actually serves a great purpose. It allows the person on the bed to view the people in the kitchen without all the smells and sounds coming through. The circular window motives bogur to get up, be happy, and play winston Monke
[2022-12-08 13:32:39] <!%MapleRoar> Bogur tries to hide the circle window from the masses
[2022-12-08 13:32:40] <+outcloak> its a hole he punched in his wall

[2022-12-08 15:32:19] <!kiba111> i hope they rework him soon
[2022-12-08 15:32:24] <Grimstab77> Well tbf, I was 1v1ing DF players as zen last patch... Wasn't really fair

[2022-12-08 15:32:29] <+SamuraiShaf> Hog wouldnt be so awful to play against if he couldnt one shot
[2022-12-08 15:32:33] <!kiba111> they hp you gain with df is crazy now
[2022-12-08 15:33:04] <+SamuraiShaf> They should just make hook lower CD, less of a one shot and lower his dmg. Would make him more of a displacement focused tank
[2022-12-08 15:33:07] <@%saphirablue_> true, in OW1 I was about to drop out of gold cause massive lose streak, so I didnt care, went Zen and deleted Dooms KEKW
[2022-12-08 15:33:23] <!kiba111> ow devs rework hog challenge (impossible)
[2022-12-08 15:33:26] <@%saphirablue_> granted he was dps then not a tank, but it was satisfying ml7LMAO
[2022-12-08 15:33:29] <xxzelda4livexx> do you have any good tips to improve my doom skills?
[2022-12-08 15:33:36] <Grimstab77> Punch every 1.5s with kitsune rush Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:33:43] <%katmosk> @kiba111 hog cant be reworked like his design is 100 relied on hook
[2022-12-08 15:33:55] <!kiba111> he can be reworked and he will be reworked sometime

[2022-12-08 15:34:09] <@%saphirablue_> lets rework hog by deleting him EZ
[2022-12-08 15:34:21] <!kiba111> df going to tank has been great too

[2022-12-08 15:34:49] <%katmosk> yeah but like u can never rework rein cuz hes completely based on havig  hammer and sheild
[2022-12-08 15:34:57] <%katmosk> hog is xompletely based on having a hook
[2022-12-08 15:34:59] <!kiba111> hes fun and no one shots like before
[2022-12-08 15:35:09] <@^Nightbot> join bogur discord to find out his secret to being so handsome https://discord.gg/HxPvnZB !
[2022-12-08 15:35:29] <!kiba111> hog could be reworked by making his hog pull you/root you
[2022-12-08 15:35:34] <!kiba111> or just remove one shot idk
[2022-12-08 15:35:41] <+SamuraiShaf> @katmosk he can keep hook, just remove one shot and make it more of a displacement ability. Make it so hog doesnt need to one shot to get value

[2022-12-08 15:36:08] <OhGodItsOz> just give a nefred whole hog as his primary and be done with it
