[2022-12-14 02:16:19] <%mikewhited32> Acclaimed indie colony/existence sim Dwarf Fortress launched on Steam(opens in new tab) on December 6, and it's since been having a bit of a moment.  Other game developers gushed about Dwarf Fortress and its influence on launch day. Someone on the Steam forums asked if all the people reviewing the game on Steam moments after launch had been "playing free DF for 25 years and just waiting for an opportunity to pay $30?" So far, the 237 page thread is almost entirely people answering "Yes."

[2022-12-14 22:16:03] <%Randomnizer> @Knives112 Yeah, after tax it was like 1600 USD
[2022-12-14 22:16:06] <%Knives112> and the 4090 will only burn down your house if you mess up the cable management
[2022-12-14 22:16:22] <%Princlet> I wonder what the next gun will do. And what personality they will have.
