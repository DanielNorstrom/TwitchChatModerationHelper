[2022-12-28 09:29:16] <aliizsa> @Johzyn it's something with aoe overlap depending on your aoe iirc, tho i haven't played it since heist league so it might have changed

[2022-12-28 09:34:27] <TheLogicFan> The best way to start something like this is to write a proper script for it.
[2022-12-28 09:35:05] <Jellooze> actioncameras are good for that. You can place them with suctioncup mounts and stuff

[2022-12-28 09:38:29] <%mrmoopie> have u considered a camera on your head? like those bands and stuff so folks can see close ups all the time?
[2022-12-28 09:38:47] <%mrmoopie> saves money for a tripod etc.
[2022-12-28 09:38:52] <%Vosy1984> camera near the wall would be ok as well, so we see the stove and the counter

[2022-12-28 10:15:30] <@%XaiTV> yeah, the problem with that is not the fact that the unique ones exist, the problem is that they drop 100% of the time

[2022-12-28 10:15:51] <%+olivertrojahn> My boneshatter had a lot of trouble, but now im clearing it almost every time
[2022-12-28 10:15:59] <@%Andrew756> you can run more than 1 at a time?
[2022-12-28 10:16:10] <@%XaiTV> and you can't collect it on 1 build and run it on another

[2022-12-28 10:18:22] <%+buffalo_sloppy> Good morning
[2022-12-28 10:18:25] <+TheodenArratay> i will chime in here, i played a build that couldnt really run the sanctums (also skill issue) and so i ended week 1 with 0 relics, and yet full watchstones, and that basically killed the league for me because i would need to farm up a whole other character to farm relics to even start doing the boss for the league mechanic
[2022-12-28 10:18:49] <OmegaUrza> @Amanel123 anything non-melee LuL
[2022-12-28 10:19:15] <%+olivertrojahn> Or just do the league mechanic on yellow tier maps until you have good enough relics
[2022-12-28 10:19:20] <%Amanel123> @OmegaUrza xD yeah i didnt play but have watched streams xD

[2022-12-28 10:21:19] <%+razzor1> @TheodenArratay had tge same, however I started another build which easily clears Sanctum. Anf adter 2 or 3 failed and bad runs which werent fun, I now got to the point where it starts clicking.

[2022-12-28 10:21:25] <+resistyouall> @nugiyen for someone who plays ssf for the first time in a while, do you have any advice for the atlas skill tree? any "must-haves" early on?

[2022-12-28 12:58:05] <+Metatron77> @itsbirkir that tends to be true for all gem effects similar; most of the time gem quality effects that read that way will impact only that gem. Gear though, or differently worded things, can impact more than just themsevles. PoE is mechanically hyper-complex in this way, and there is no shame in asking, nor in looking up interactions on the wiki!

[2022-12-28 15:08:42] <+SlightRedeye> as an archetype
[2022-12-28 15:08:46] <@%QuackSage> true since the slam era melee hasn't had a high peek
[2022-12-28 15:08:47] <@%+DerangedM8> unless you get at the high ceiling you just play balistas honestly
[2022-12-28 15:08:53] <+SlightRedeye> and not giga bossing builds besides EA/TR
[2022-12-28 15:08:54] <@Thriefos> bows have less available hp nodes than fkn witch LUL
[2022-12-28 15:08:55] <XinLao> @nugiyen the only reason boneshatter is good is because the gem itself has rampup damage, doesn't require a lot of gear for actual good progress, and it actually benefits going into the right side of the tree for precise technique and spell suppression. the moment precise technique is removes even boneshatter will hit a bottom hole

[2022-12-28 15:11:05] <scout_approved> alot of melee builds can deal alot of dmg and have alot of defences. the problem is movement, the amount of skills you need to use and the amount of actuell dps time you have on a boss
[2022-12-28 15:11:08] <Azraelos> melee was good when it was screen wide, basically when they're not melee

[2022-12-28 15:14:25] <XinLao> @Vosy1984 Vulnerability was "broken" but the fact of the truth is that once again bleed archtype got actually nerfed again, with these changes to curses and the change to vuln. They removes 20% faster bleed, which is a BIG chunk of damage and it didn't got compensated at all
[2022-12-28 15:14:55] <Jagt_69> bleed died when they nerfed the elder mod right?

But after that it has been just nerfs after indirect nerfs after targeted nerfs etc etc

[2022-12-28 15:20:25] <XinLao> @Jagt_69 it reached now even a point where you don't even have ways to craft "proper" gear, you hardly manage to get over 700m dps, and the worst of it all is that you don't even have damage on the tree. you rely on at least 3/4 cluster jewels to actually have damage, and this is counting with good rolled basic jewels on top of it as well
