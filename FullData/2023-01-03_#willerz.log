[2023-01-03 17:52:29] <+Regulus713> @ZomBeastMode I think it is inevitable, YouTube has adopted AV1, as well as OBS, even if Twitch doesn't profit as much it would be way worse for them to be left behind, YouTube is competing on the streaming market as well and Twitch can't afford to be left behind. New snapdragon phone chipsets also support AV1

[2023-01-03 19:30:01] <BosworthsChili> SSN is a terrible idea for data privacy/data breach reasons.

[2023-01-03 19:32:24] <%$QuiGonJoel> Why not SSN? @AphantosOmma  if you get caught cheating then you will be flagged perma

[2023-01-03 19:34:56] <BosworthsChili> @QuiGonJoel The point isn't that you can obliterate cheating rings. The point is that the cure is worse than the disease.

[2023-01-03 19:38:31] <%Reap3r1G> Is it a cheater if you fight and die instantly with no sound effects or is it bugged
[2023-01-03 19:38:32] <GamingSteamz> yes an ad is playing
[2023-01-03 19:38:32] <Legit_ReapZ> What are you running now the sr?
[2023-01-03 19:38:33] <%+Galifinakis> @Trustno1diealone actually the establishment owner hires the bouncer lol
[2023-01-03 19:38:37] <+Lazerplatypus> no
[2023-01-03 19:38:41] <Legit_ReapZ> No ad
[2023-01-03 19:38:43] <+Invisible_19> i don't have ads
[2023-01-03 19:38:48] <%$QuiGonJoel> They can already do it if they wanted to @theliustv -- I'm saying that some regulation on cheating in games would be refreshing. DBstyle Da government aint all bad
[2023-01-03 19:38:48] <GamingSteamz> monkaW its being blocked
[2023-01-03 19:38:49] <bajigemap> Nice song

[2023-01-03 19:38:58] <Trustno1diealone> That‚Äôs what Im saying. The bar hires.
[2023-01-03 19:39:10] <%$MOT502> @wookme  I no how it is too be new.
[2023-01-03 19:39:11] <%$QuiGonJoel> @Trustno1diealone that's silly, the age of drinking at a bar IS REGULATED by the government
[2023-01-03 19:39:12] <%+Galifinakis> did the gov hire the owner????
[2023-01-03 19:39:28] <%+Galifinakis> actually its by the state
[2023-01-03 19:39:29] <%+theliustv> @QuiGonJoel I agree there needs to be better cheat prevention, but I don't think getting the government involved is the right call. As it was said earlier by someone, the cure (mentioned in this case the Government) is worse than the disease.

[2023-01-03 19:40:10] <%$QuiGonJoel> I think that cheating on video games online should be a criminal offense.

[2023-01-03 19:41:10] <BosworthsChili> @QuiGonJoel It should be when done for money. But you have to be a moron or evil to want the regulatory and police power necessary to eradicate cheating in all online gaming.
[2023-01-03 19:41:23] <%xgon9> @Galifinakis who urt you?
[2023-01-03 19:41:27] <%+theliustv> @QuiGonJoel Now this is a bad take lol. Cheaters in the case of tarkov have virtually no impact on society.
[2023-01-03 19:41:39] <BosworthsChili> Like -- imagine thinking you want armed government agents to come to a 15 year olds house just because he cheated against you in Tarkov.

[2023-01-03 19:42:08] <+DrakeKurthem> Cheating in tournaments sure, there's precedence for that. Look at the huge fishing tourney scandal that lead to two arrests.
[2023-01-03 19:42:12] <HamgoatTTV> my fps was half then normal until i disabled binarual audio
[2023-01-03 19:42:37] <%+theliustv> Cheating in a casual environment should definitely not be a criminal offense.
[2023-01-03 19:42:48] <+DrakeKurthem> Because they cheated. Cheating is wrong unless you're playing single player. Cheat away then.
[2023-01-03 19:42:56] <BosworthsChili> @ZStyle It's weird that you salivate over kids being gunned down.

[2023-01-03 20:34:38] <%+txnoboy> do you and des only play early wipe together
[2023-01-03 20:34:59] <%+misticalmuslim> @WillerZ any good ways you use to help Endurance leveling without focusing it?
[2023-01-03 20:35:14] <nailpickjuror> @misticalmuslim play more
[2023-01-03 20:35:29] <%jgiggles90> @misticalmuslim what i do is load into a raid, drop my backpack so i'm not overweight, run around a bit, then carry on
[2023-01-03 20:35:42] <MR___MEME> @WillerZ how you bud???

[2023-01-03 20:36:11] <%+misticalmuslim> @jgiggles90 makes sense I just realized I got lvl7 strength and eduro was 1
[2023-01-03 20:36:14] <%xgon9> I love playing with friends, but i think playing solo makes it a little easier to do what you want and howyou want without thinking about what your teammate is doing
[2023-01-03 20:36:26] <KYplottin> what can i do with a blue folder

[2023-01-03 20:36:43] <%jgiggles90> @misticalmuslim yeah my strenght always levels up way faster since loading in with a kit eearly to mid wipe you're basically overweight lol
[2023-01-03 20:36:44] <$skoobietv> you cant level endurance when ur overweight and u wont level strength when ur underweight
[2023-01-03 20:36:47] <MR___MEME> good good @WillerZ trying this 'solo' wipe out its a bit different. Hows it going for you???
[2023-01-03 20:36:57] <+super_1096> @misticalmuslim at the start of each raid, you need to fully run out your stamina bar. this gives you the best multiplier to go towards endurance. just make sure in your inventory your the weight numbers are white. if they are yellow you are leveling strength
[2023-01-03 20:36:58] <%+rubydoobers> @xgon9 yeah takes away the uncertainty of who's who
[2023-01-03 20:37:18] <%ExCAL1BURx_x> "is that laser you?, Yes. THe blue laser is you?. No. so that laser is not yours. No mine is red. FUCK"
[2023-01-03 20:37:34] <$skoobietv> also that, make sure you finish ur first 2 FULL stam bars dont jump or hit a bush
[2023-01-03 20:37:45] <%+misticalmuslim> @super_1096 thanks for the tech side of it!

[2023-01-03 21:32:41] <%Playermodd> BSG should just enable cheats in the game themselves and everyone will just cheat in the game it will be great
