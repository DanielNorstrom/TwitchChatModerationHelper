[2022-12-25 06:22:30] <%$barrakuta371> Humans are naturally social. Some may not want to admit, but we seek out comfort in the company of others. I am genuinely empathetic to how you feel. My parents split and remarried, so my sister and I have to appeal to both sides of the family every year. It never get easier. I hope at the very least you find comfort in the mods and chat, and when you visit family tomorrow. cheer200

In the end, we move on with the memories of our loved ones, and the friendships we have, of our families.

[2022-12-25 17:48:36] <@%Konotomo> Generally girls who know other girls are interested would give that away. I'd avoid it entirely. Just ask her directly.

[2022-12-25 17:49:17] <Niveksirrah> Interesting. I was wondering because I've had people ask ME for the number of other friends (guys and girls) and I always feel uncomfortable giving that out to someone I don't know
[2022-12-25 17:49:46] <@%Konotomo> Feel free to ask the girls friends for like info on what kind of date they might like or what they might be interested in! Then they will tell the girl you like you asked, and that will make you look interested and caring. moonifiedAbsolutepower moonifiedAbsolutepower moonifiedAbsolutepower moonifiedAbsolutepower moonifiedAbsolutepower Or if they don't like you, you'll find that out.

[2022-12-25 18:15:12] <BioSammich> The "friendzone" was created to shame people for not sharing feelings, and put the burden of the rejection on the opposite person. It's a cheap way to say "I was rejected, but it had nothing to do with me, it's their fault, feel bad for me"

[2022-12-25 18:15:39] <%+S1lentSymphony> Unfortunately for guys, many times those small compliments get taken the wrong way because we are so starved for positive attention. Same with giving most guys a hug or anything, because many guys are super touch starved as well. It isn't an excuse at all, but it explains a lot of misinterpreted things.
[2022-12-25 18:15:42] <@%dan_the_ninja_man> "Just be nice" is a solid rule

[2022-12-25 18:22:07] <Niveksirrah> "bro talk" Is something a lot of gals don't get. But mooni does XD
