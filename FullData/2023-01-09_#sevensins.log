[2023-01-09 10:51:29] <@%+Mike410459> No. The first Fiesta was Seven and Cereth
[2023-01-09 10:51:41] <%AngaPeeters> FF month(s) started with Cereth and Crumps. It changed to FFF when Seven got in the mix. Then Crumps left. Then Seven and BGG took over and here we are
[2023-01-09 10:51:53] <@%+Mike410459> This is the 7th Fiesta. BGG has been here for 6 of them

[2023-01-09 10:52:26] <%AngaPeeters> we don't shittalk other streamers in here, just sayin

[2023-01-09 11:51:33] <%$FFyte> it's not like Shenmue, where you can skip cutscenes on your second playthrough?
[2023-01-09 11:52:02] <%spectr0nn> the ting with GOWR and cutscenes is that its one big continous take
[2023-01-09 11:52:04] <DaRealHizza> one shot no black screens
[2023-01-09 11:52:04] <%spectr0nn> there's not cuts
[2023-01-09 11:52:15] <%$FFyte> so it's all in-game and moves you through the game
[2023-01-09 11:52:29] <DaRealHizza> yeah all cutscenes are rendered in game
[2023-01-09 11:52:54] <%spectr0nn> yeah and i imagine they keep streaming in new content as the game moves along
[2023-01-09 11:53:21] <%spectr0nn> but yeha its definitely not good for replayability or speedrunning

[2023-01-09 12:11:54] <!%+yrvengalied> you can get 2 if am not wrong
[2023-01-09 12:11:58] <%Sensei_Neal> If you do the DLC you could get 2 of them in normal mode
[2023-01-09 12:12:38] <%Sensei_Neal> I accept it, I should have left it unequipped
[2023-01-09 12:12:39] <DaRealHizza> no you have to beat in hard mode Pride & joy for gotterdammerung
[2023-01-09 12:12:40] <%XyFreak> nah they did good not locking the challenge fights behind a 2nd playthrough
[2023-01-09 12:12:43] <DaRealHizza> or weis in dlc
[2023-01-09 12:12:48] <DaRealHizza> both hard mode exlcusive bosses
[2023-01-09 12:12:48] <%Sensei_Neal> even the last boss was first try
[2023-01-09 12:13:20] <DaRealHizza> so you cant gotterdammerung in normal mode its hard mode exclusive even in DLC
[2023-01-09 12:13:29] <%Sensei_Neal> Rebirth will be too easy if they leave you with everything. I predict Yuffie steals all your stuff near the beginning
[2023-01-09 12:13:37] <%$Aurien__> apparently you can do the VR fights in hard difficulty, in normal mode

[2023-01-09 12:15:59] <%Lonefellow> I can understand it. I felt the same way when I tried KH2 Critical Mode for the first time. So damn satisfying and forces you to use every single trick in the book.

[2023-01-09 12:20:24] <%$Aurien__> if they don't have a hard mode for the rest of the new FFs going forward
[2023-01-09 12:20:33] <%$Aurien__> then they'll be dissapointing
[2023-01-09 12:20:45] <%Lonefellow> Remind me, did XV have difficulty options?
[2023-01-09 12:20:57] <%$Aurien__> normal/easy
[2023-01-09 12:21:01] <Lockehart> it almost feels like they designed the game around hard mode and just pulled mechanics back for normal.
[2023-01-09 12:21:05] <%Sensei_Neal> FF15 was trash,
[2023-01-09 12:21:05] <%Meihru> xv had easy and normal iirc
[2023-01-09 12:21:15] <Lockehart> similar to how they do it in FF14
[2023-01-09 12:21:23] <%Sensei_Neal> Way t easy if you do the side quests and fighting was over simplified
[2023-01-09 12:21:27] <Skyblueaqua> I expect rebirth to cover most of the world map though, there will be a lot more content so maybe it won't have a need for a hard mode

[2023-01-09 12:21:46] <%$Aurien__> need or no

[2023-01-09 12:22:00] <%Svinder> While I like the general idea of this Hardmode, I dislike that it removes items alltogether. I understand that   with items, it would possibly be too easy, but removing an entire aspect of the game is a bit weird. though I have no idea how to allow items and still make it this hard
[2023-01-09 12:22:07] <%$Aurien__> if they don't have it, it will automatically be more disappointing than part 1
[2023-01-09 12:22:17] <%XyFreak> i really like this rendition on the turks theme

[2023-01-09 15:35:34] <%TidusZecht> a whole 2 chapters of gold saucer Kappa
[2023-01-09 15:35:38] <dracodai> Only 1 episode of golden saucer? and here i was hoping for several.
[2023-01-09 15:35:45] <%Sensei_Neal> City of the ancients, isnt it in the prmised land?
[2023-01-09 15:35:46] <%iktasentrosi> Gold Saucer is going to be fun. I agree though, probably events in Kalm to the City of the Ancients.
[2023-01-09 15:35:50] <%+luis_sardinha> new threat 2.0 is quite a good alternative for the story line :)
[2023-01-09 15:35:56] <%Sensei_Neal> Are they not the same or at least overlapping
[2023-01-09 15:35:57] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reiwamagi Not true, Dyne talks about Marlene's mom a lot

[2023-01-09 15:36:29] <$ReiwaMagi> Doubt it will end at WEAPONS awakening.
[2023-01-09 15:36:39] <$ReiwaMagi> Likely it will be earlier
[2023-01-09 15:36:39] <%+luis_sardinha> there are some theories stating Marlene is an ancient, following the way she talked with Aeris and vice-versa
[2023-01-09 15:36:43] <%+Drakorious> oh boy, kyrie needs to accidentally fall on some sharp spikes

[2023-01-09 15:37:23] <%+Lady_Lorr> @reiwamagi He literally wants to kill his daughter so that his wife won't be alone and you get her pendant to escape the corel prison and Eleanor is not an ancient and neither is Marlene

[2023-01-09 16:35:07] <%Neobullseye> @crowdpleazer06 The whole point of Materia is so that common people can use it. So yes.

[2023-01-09 16:35:53] <crowdpleazer06> @Neobullseye so with that being the case wouldnt you equip every single person with a elemtal materia and a heal materia and could have a army of healers and damage dealers?
[2023-01-09 16:36:29] <crowdpleazer06> so say 100k fire 1 going off and 100k cures wouldnt ya like control the world with the populace alone lol

[2023-01-09 16:37:53] <crowdpleazer06> @Neobullseye ah that would make sense
[2023-01-09 16:38:04] <%Neobullseye> You can buy a ton of it for gameplay convenience, but lore-wise it's supposed to be rare.
