[2023-01-10 19:41:31] <%maxmotivated> im interested in japanese culture, for me as an outsider it looks like japan has a real misogynist problem. things like stalking are kinda normal, women have almsot no rights, and all this backwards bs. imo japan has to come a long way to become friendly enough to foreigners, to push this problems away. i mean there is stilla s3xual harrasment bar in tokiyo KEKW
