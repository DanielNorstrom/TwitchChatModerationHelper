[2023-01-05 15:12:13] <jjkwong> @DiamondFluxx The system is basically a pool of items u can get, a set of all components gets added at different points and when u get a component u reduce whats in the pool. So you technically have a lower chance of getting so many of the component, emily got 2/3 of the chains in her pool
