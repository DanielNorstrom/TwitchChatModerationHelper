[2022-12-23 08:37:51] <!%dreiinfinity> They were all supposed to form a bang train so they all get identified as one entity (wolf) once they entered each other.

[2022-12-23 08:42:38] <%darkbiacksnow> oh I remember the solution, it was to force the wolf to another person
[2022-12-23 08:42:42] <%darkbiacksnow> then kill that person
[2022-12-23 08:43:07] <@%Cetkaman> why is that a solution? Thinkge
[2022-12-23 08:43:07] <%trolsopol> but then you still die no ?
[2022-12-23 08:43:13] <%trolsopol> you're not wolf so EXPLOSION
[2022-12-23 08:43:15] <!%MisterMonsieur> sudoku? Deadlole

[2022-12-23 08:43:28] <!%ReeEle_> FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-23 08:43:33] <!%Sscuzzy> but i think the criteria is
[2022-12-23 08:43:38] <!%Sscuzzy> be a wolf at the end of the game
[2022-12-23 08:43:45] <!%Sscuzzy> and not be a sheeple
[2022-12-23 08:43:49] <%Homeless_Emperor> ye
[2022-12-23 08:43:58] <%darkbiacksnow> it always weirded me out
[2022-12-23 08:44:05] <%darkbiacksnow> that you need to look at the sheep
[2022-12-23 08:44:08] <%darkbiacksnow> to pass the wolf
[2022-12-23 08:44:13] <%darkbiacksnow> its like you're intentionally passing it
[2022-12-23 08:44:25] <!%ReeEle_> Homi FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-23 08:44:26] <%darkbiacksnow> why would you pass wolf Thinkge
[2022-12-23 08:44:29] <@%Cetkaman> what weirded me out, that his game just would be a bloodbath if not Frenn playing
[2022-12-23 08:44:35] <!%MisterMonsieur> FeelsStrongMan Homi
[2022-12-23 08:44:40] <@%Cetkaman> only makes sense with Homi
[2022-12-23 08:44:42] <!%Sscuzzy> i think thats the point of it too
[2022-12-23 08:44:47] <!%Sscuzzy> cause its a game of heart
[2022-12-23 08:44:51] <!%Sscuzzy> so its meant to be fucky
[2022-12-23 08:45:00] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah, its betrayal
[2022-12-23 08:45:02] <!%Sscuzzy> all about betrayal or
[2022-12-23 08:45:05] <@%Cetkaman> because why would you want to live without your Homi s verySadge
[2022-12-23 08:45:05] <!%Sscuzzy> sacrifices

[2022-12-23 12:35:14] <%cryobridgadier> Hi, 4k player here who reported slasher. Slasher was our position 1 faceless void. He built a mek and had around 29 healing salves in his inventory. He would chrono both teams in the middle of a fight, salve his allies, pop mek, and proceeded to yell "SLASHER'S WAY". We gave him position 1 farm so he could be a position 5. Granted, his unorthodox build worked and carried us to victory but I still felt it deserved a report.

[2022-12-23 12:51:21] <%+tegsneakers> @singsing what does kontol mean? chat told me "kontol" is snake in Indonesian, right? I told some friends at work that I liked petting kontols, and they seemed very happy. they even invited me to a kontol party this weekend, said I could take turns touching and playing with their kontols. they were grinning a lot, I didnt know Indonesians liked keeping snakes as pets too.

[2022-12-23 13:26:24] <bairdrills> True
[2022-12-23 13:26:24] <%$byukino> the dota anime would have been amazing if it actually had time to develop

[2022-12-23 13:26:53] <such_turista> the arcane fight scene was insane
[2022-12-23 13:26:54] <%altkyu_ix> an animated fight of TI would have been amazing

[2022-12-23 13:27:23] <%atonofstuff> arcane is better and i dont even know league spells\
[2022-12-23 13:27:23] <nick_nova_> still wonder how edgerunner beat arcane tho

[2022-12-23 13:29:10] <$임팩트아치 (roxhfodl2025)> @singsing i really didn't like they choose Original storyline later than use Heroes origin. that's why we love Arcane.

[2022-12-23 13:33:22] <Hjolt> @singsing the root of the problem in "adaptations" is that in any cinema uni you are taught that "illustrating" a story that exists in a book is bad. because as is that form is a perfect fit. so you have to reevalueate material. problem is people seldom know how to do it properly and it becomes fucking shit. sorry for long post.

[2022-12-23 13:42:04] <%+TheBeeArr> You know what's funny, Sing? Here in Japan they tend to remake American movies and Korean dramas with Japanese actors. They are all pretty bad compared to their source material, mostly because Japanese actors are pretty bad with scripts outside of their culture.
