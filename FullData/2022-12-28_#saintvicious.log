[2022-12-28 16:01:15] <+uldumarr> Is IE so bad because it's a lot harder to utilize the damage amp of the crits due to AD being harder  to stack as high as AP (especially after base AD nerfs last set)

[2022-12-28 21:32:31] <+ally_player> once you get into gold, you kind of have to flex off of the meta lists and eventually you find your playstyle doing that
