[2023-01-05 00:00:14] <@%Greygull> You could make it all as blueprints rather than actual designations
[2023-01-05 00:00:19] <EternalFireseal> that should work.

[2023-01-05 01:31:47] <Kos475> yeah because then if someone angers you you just laser them
[2023-01-05 01:31:47] <%Mylexsi> yeah but once the laser's in your eye then you can shoot the laser back out of your eye
[2023-01-05 01:31:48] <Madbat> Laser eyes worth, and they'll hurt for like a week at most if (very small if) it goes well

[2023-01-05 01:50:40] <%BestyVT> I think it's like 10 spaces? but you can put the storage for the workshops on the side close to the bedrooms
[2023-01-05 01:50:41] <Putnam3145> @BestyVT workshop jobs causing noise are commented out for now. if the toad or I feel cruel one day we will enable them. and yes it travels across z-level, 9x9x9 cube around the space

[2023-01-05 01:51:57] <Putnam3145> it's also the main cause of cavern agitation, so if you're seeing a lot of cavern invaders it's because you're mining nearby
[2023-01-05 01:52:03] <Putnam3145> @Nebukadnezzer yes, in the latest FOTF; it's eventually

[2023-01-05 02:02:43] <@%Greygull> also it angers elves

[2023-01-05 02:02:46] <Nebukadnezzer> makes sense to me
[2023-01-05 02:02:50] <Leud_De_Grace> For barrels I think rocks can make jars but they're heavier
[2023-01-05 02:02:52] <%ughdontmakemeregister> if you make bins out of, heh, lead, or heavy metal, you'll watch your dwarves struggle to move with them
[2023-01-05 02:02:56] <%AlmondRoll> the literal only downside is that you can't sell wood bins to elves
[2023-01-05 02:03:05] <Nebukadnezzer> we don't make moving boxes out of lead, we make them out of cardboard
[2023-01-05 02:03:08] <@%Greygull> You can just sell the contents of the wood bins to the elves though
[2023-01-05 02:03:09] <%BestyVT> yeah I dunno if different woods weigh more or not though, highwood might be heavy?
[2023-01-05 02:03:15] <%ughdontmakemeregister> if you can get featherwood thats the best bin material but it only grows in good biomes

[2023-01-05 02:03:29] <%AlmondRoll> if you're using metal bins you're using wood anyway for the fuel
[2023-01-05 02:03:32] <@%Greygull> Woods do have some variable weight
[2023-01-05 02:03:36] <%ughdontmakemeregister> @BestyVT glumprong is the heaviest wood it grows in evil biomes only though
[2023-01-05 02:03:45] <@%Greygull> The heaviest wood is apparently "blood thorn"
[2023-01-05 02:04:03] <%thatcrazycrabs> Go anger! Go go, go anger!
[2023-01-05 02:04:05] <@%Greygull> and the lightest wood is "feather"
[2023-01-05 02:04:08] <@%Greygull> because blood wood is heavier than feathers.

[2023-01-05 02:15:07] <papaPathos> dwarves search each other out now, so it doesnt matter anymore. just leave enough space in your dining hall / tavern for them to actually mingle
