[2023-01-01 18:31:14] <@^StreamElements> Do not tell the A.I. to "Pull on X banner". The A.I. will pull if he wants to. You will be muted / banned if you repeatedly do this.

[2023-01-01 18:51:46] <+mymsoup> raiden E->kazuha E->sara EQ->raiden for buffs->mona Q->raidenQ
[2023-01-01 18:51:46] <not_krazykat> HungryPaimon HungryPaimon HungryPaimon
[2023-01-01 18:51:47] <matess36> why dont you let join somebody with bennet and mona
[2023-01-01 18:51:50] <leaf_cryo> This should work what you said
[2023-01-01 18:51:51] <lokitruth> Sara q -> e -> raiden burst
[2023-01-01 18:51:55] <genshinimpact_always> My brain is officially stuck lol
[2023-01-01 18:51:56] <mage56> Hey java how are you
[2023-01-01 18:52:03] <kjh_2k9> idk, gl with what ever you do!
[2023-01-01 18:52:13] <kjh_2k9> xD
[2023-01-01 18:52:16] <candy_girl072813> how daer u
[2023-01-01 18:52:18] <platinaaa_> rotations are hard
[2023-01-01 18:52:25] <alhaitham0848> sara q -> kazuha -> mona -> raiden
[2023-01-01 18:52:26] <razynpod1> i woke up late what have i missed
[2023-01-01 18:52:29] <leaf_cryo> You take down the sheild, use kazu, then mona sara and raiden
[2023-01-01 18:52:31] <CharlieGe_> @notanararaaranara still -80%
[2023-01-01 18:52:31] <Hyper4325> trilling tales can stay off field so you can pass to raiden before starting the rotation
[2023-01-01 18:52:32] <owliguess> hyperbloom just swooshes everyting
[2023-01-01 18:52:38] <lokitruth> I think you should use dendro instead of mona
[2023-01-01 18:52:39] <alhaitham0848> sara doesnt need to do e
[2023-01-01 18:52:42] <alhaitham0848> her q applies the e buff
[2023-01-01 18:52:45] <lokitruth> Because of the aggravate buff
[2023-01-01 18:52:46] <netta_bb> dosnt sara need attack?
[2023-01-01 18:52:47] <+mymsoup> her Q triggers her c6
[2023-01-01 18:52:49] <yoimiya_main3000> Hey uhm‚Ä¶ tell me if this is weird but, I kinda got married in Genshin
[2023-01-01 18:52:49] <h8renx> Raiden e, kazuha e, kazuha q, mona q, sara q, raiden q
[2023-01-01 18:52:52] <notanararaaranara> @CharlieGe_ how much is the electro res?
[2023-01-01 18:52:52] <lokitruth> It boosts electro dmg
[2023-01-01 18:52:53] <platinaaa_> C6 Sara is different
[2023-01-01 18:52:54] <urius_b> raiden e, kazuha e, sara q, swap to raiden for buff, mona q, raiden q
[2023-01-01 18:52:55] <chicken_0v0> put noblese on sara
[2023-01-01 18:52:59] <bea_tempest1> Raiden e> kazuha e & q> Sara q & e> Mona q> raiden q

[2023-01-01 18:53:11] <yunjinc3> u got this java
[2023-01-01 18:53:11] <owliguess> yes
[2023-01-01 18:53:15] <%+snowsprin> @yoimiya_main3000 what?! Haha elaborate please!
[2023-01-01 18:53:23] <leaf_cryo> Rember after you use the q of sara to switch to raiden to get the buff
[2023-01-01 18:53:26] <Its_Mari03> YOU DO NEED E
[2023-01-01 18:53:27] <kjh_2k9> raiden e _ kujou q mona q kazuha e raiden q maybe?
[2023-01-01 18:53:28] <+mymsoup> mona ALWAYS goes last
[2023-01-01 18:53:34] <Nekocima> you have to go mona into raiden for raiden to get the buff
[2023-01-01 18:53:38] <urius_b> kazuha only needs either e or q you don‚Äôt need to do both
[2023-01-01 18:53:39] <matess36> why dont you let join somebody with bennet and mona
[2023-01-01 18:53:39] <Xuotami> Sara is confusing
[2023-01-01 18:53:42] <%+ronnie_882> @bea_tempest1 yes
[2023-01-01 18:53:43] <+mymsoup> raiden E->kazuha E->sara EQ->raiden for buffs->mona Q->raidenQ
[2023-01-01 18:53:44] <pumpkinpieplum> just use lisa her def shred is better than sara if she's not c6
[2023-01-01 18:53:45] <CharlieGe_> @notanararaaranara -80 in paralysed state, every other element is -140
[2023-01-01 18:53:46] <yoimiya_main3000> @snowsprin Like I got married in the game to an actual person
[2023-01-01 18:53:51] <genshinimpact_always> So what are we trying to do?
[2023-01-01 18:53:53] <sarmatmurt_> sara need to do e it gives atk burst gives you cr damage
[2023-01-01 18:53:55] <r_two43> all this and i bet the flower dies before raiden's burst
[2023-01-01 18:53:57] <kjh_2k9> put it in order maybe
[2023-01-01 18:53:59] <Its_Mari03> raiden E->kazuha E->sara EQ->raiden for buffs->mona Q->raidenQ
[2023-01-01 18:54:02] <h8renx> At this point lets just smash our heads into a wall
[2023-01-01 18:54:03] <platinaaa_> Raiden e > Kazuha e q > Sara q> Raiden > Mona q > Raiden q
[2023-01-01 18:54:05] <leaf_cryo> we always can do this again-
[2023-01-01 18:54:06] <kjh_2k9> ohhh...
[2023-01-01 18:54:09] <notanararaaranara> @CharlieGe_ ohh ok, tyty
[2023-01-01 18:54:16] <bea_tempest1> Then raiden e> kazuha e & q> Sara q> raiden> Mona q> reading q
[2023-01-01 18:54:22] <lokitruth> Do the perpetual mechanical array because it has negative resistance
[2023-01-01 18:54:26] <Its_Mari03> raiden E->kazuha E->sara EQ->raiden for buffs->mona Q->raidenQ.
[2023-01-01 18:54:28] <lokitruth> In weakened state
[2023-01-01 18:54:30] <pr3ttygurl_mani> raidens burst has to go last some how
[2023-01-01 18:54:30] <kingssmythe> the problem is both sara and mona in the team i think cause they give the same kind of buff but only to the character you're switching to
[2023-01-01 18:54:31] <greyincognito> Don‚Äôt think the buff‚Äôll last that long
[2023-01-01 18:54:40] <HussainLoay22> you can dash with mona
[2023-01-01 18:54:43] <platinaaa_> test it on the primo geovishap
[2023-01-01 18:54:50] <5amine5> do scara boss because it has negative res and def

[2023-01-01 18:55:56] <lokitruth> DO MECHANICAL ARRAY
[2023-01-01 18:55:59] <HussainLoay22> you can sprint with mona to break the flower thingy
[2023-01-01 18:56:03] <Sporustus> You swirled pyro
[2023-01-01 18:56:11] <Xuotami> Don't have your characters affected by pyro
[2023-01-01 18:56:12] <alhaitham0848> i think u cant do flower, cuz u always swirl pyro
[2023-01-01 18:56:16] <leaf_cryo> use raiden e i guess
[2023-01-01 18:56:19] <lokitruth> IT HAS NEGATIVE RES AND NO ELEMENT AND LOTS OF HP
[2023-01-01 18:56:20] <theapplel> The ult doesnt need to be elctro
[2023-01-01 18:56:20] <sirmax12> try strong boss this boss died fast that why didn't crit

[2023-01-01 18:56:23] <platinaaa_> it double swirls both pyro and electro
[2023-01-01 18:56:25] <cameliae_> test it on PMA so you wont mess it up with the pyro
[2023-01-01 18:56:29] <astroluvos> you use raiden e -> kazuha q immediatly

[2023-01-01 18:57:15] <5amine5> itto domain pma or scara are good for test
[2023-01-01 18:57:18] <notanararaaranara> @ronnie_882 wouldnt pma still do more dmg tho
[2023-01-01 18:57:21] <platinaaa_> yes! you can double swirls with Kazuha!
[2023-01-01 18:57:28] <candy_girl072813> are u still recooding @java
[2023-01-01 18:57:33] <sazke66> cool music
[2023-01-01 18:57:36] <kjh_2k9> is mona needed?
[2023-01-01 18:57:37] <anami_0> heyy
[2023-01-01 18:57:38] <matess36> use abyss floor 7
[2023-01-01 18:57:41] <lokitruth> Sara e buffs atk
[2023-01-01 18:57:52] <notanararaaranara> @neighbourhood_emo you tooo!
[2023-01-01 18:57:57] <+mymsoup> abyss floor 7 is good too ye
[2023-01-01 18:57:57] <lokitruth> I think you should replace Mona with dendro for aggravate buff
[2023-01-01 18:58:02] <leaf_cryo> i dont think double swirl is a thing with kazu q
[2023-01-01 18:58:03] <kingssmythe> you dony need charged atk with sara with c2, the E leaves the buff automatically on the floor
[2023-01-01 18:58:03] <5amine5> or scara boss
[2023-01-01 18:58:05] <lokitruth> And run Sara on noblesse
[2023-01-01 18:58:05] <alhaitham0848> i think use yanfei for ttds, bennet for pyro res and buff, and just remove mona lol
[2023-01-01 18:58:16] <notanararaaranara> @lokitruth mona on nobless
[2023-01-01 18:58:18] <kjh_2k9> i thought it was 20 min you need to wait for

[2023-01-01 18:58:22] <platinaaa_> no Mona is better than pyro res
[2023-01-01 18:58:37] <+mymsoup> @lokitruth nah, aggravate is a flat damage buff. It doesn't scale with how high you hit so it isn't good for nukes
[2023-01-01 18:58:38] <solojager63> u dont need to kill it now
[2023-01-01 18:58:41] <lokitruth> @notanararaaranara noblesse buffs stack I think
[2023-01-01 18:58:45] <lokitruth> So more atk
[2023-01-01 18:58:48] <solojager63> just run
[2023-01-01 18:58:49] <kjh_2k9> do you have candace on this acount?
[2023-01-01 18:58:54] <platinaaa_> @lokitruth no it doesn't stack
[2023-01-01 18:58:58] <owliguess> rhw pilwa
[2023-01-01 18:58:59] <theotherac> you need to use others bursts to get stacks for raiden

[2023-01-01 19:05:05] <shylilly_fan_hehe> coop with someone who has the scaramouche boss java
[2023-01-01 19:05:12] <yongxue8234> the electrodamage
[2023-01-01 19:05:16] <calx_illust> basically electro dmg gains crit dmg once the charatcer has sara buff
[2023-01-01 19:05:19] <platinaaa_> if a character has Sara atk buff, their electro crit dmg increases by 60%
[2023-01-01 19:05:31] <h8renx> U dont need to use E since shes C6 btw
[2023-01-01 19:05:37] <HussainLoay22> any electro damage skill get the 60% CD
[2023-01-01 19:05:40] <cameliae_> it‚Äôs better using EQ together
[2023-01-01 19:05:45] <notanararaaranara> if you do like a c6 shenhe chongyun cryo raiden plunge, with a bounty with 750% plunge atk res decrease?
[2023-01-01 19:06:10] <alhaitham0848> ok, so raiden -50%, scara -140%, PMA -40%, so scara has the most by a long shot
[2023-01-01 19:06:11] <5amine5> coop with someone who have the scara boss unlocked
[2023-01-01 19:06:16] <shylilly_fan_hehe> wait did java pull for c6 raiden
[2023-01-01 19:06:28] <+mymsoup> using E and Q together is just used in abyss because sara buffs her own burst damage with her E lol
[2023-01-01 19:06:36] <notanararaaranara> @shylilly_fan_hehe c3 r1
[2023-01-01 19:06:37] <5amine5> it's worth it for 1 mil
