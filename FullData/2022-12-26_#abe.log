[2022-12-26 23:52:10] <Elyyr__> yes, but they have to be on a coral block
[2022-12-26 23:52:11] <%+WilliCookie> Bone meal yeah

[2022-12-26 23:52:41] <%that_xix> you put it on top of coral blocks
[2022-12-26 23:52:46] <shwumph> They have to be on coral
[2022-12-26 23:52:46] <%+Taticles> On coral block
[2022-12-26 23:52:51] <+SuiteSunrise> on coral
[2022-12-26 23:52:58] <T_SaVVy_> 3x3 coral. Put it in middle and bonemeal
[2022-12-26 23:53:02] <shwumph> So the easiest way is to bonemeal them to max before picking them up from the ocean
[2022-12-26 23:53:07] VIEWERS: 363
[2022-12-26 23:53:24] <T_SaVVy_> it will spread to other coral
[2022-12-26 23:53:35] <+SuiteSunrise> so it'll have room to grow i assume
[2022-12-26 23:53:38] <%+Taticles> Can make redstone auto machines for sea pickles
