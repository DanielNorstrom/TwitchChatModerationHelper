[2022-12-03 17:21:32] <Ari_5000> @queensferra No the game sees it as being slower than everyone working on a gen each for 90 seconds
[2022-12-03 17:21:35] <fengminirl> @Queensferra i think the technical way it is, is because its going slower for you both individually but because theres 2 of you its faster? if that makes sense lol

[2022-12-03 17:25:26] <Ravomat> maybe the dc was due to something entirely unrelated to the game. unlikely but possible.

[2022-12-03 17:25:36] <7_ate_nein> only legit reason to DC is a bug or hack that doesn't allow you to play the game

[2022-12-03 17:57:33] <Kxrishima> someone camped with this killer by staying in his power and using make your choice, staying in power apparently counts as being away from the hook, so make your choice procs and the killer is still right next to your hook and just downs the exposed survivor
[2022-12-03 17:57:33] <tukiaut> Do as you please, its fine, i get that it is very frustrating sometimes

[2022-12-03 17:57:54] <Jonseredi> What killer do you usually play off-stream or do you play any? @Otzdarva
[2022-12-03 17:57:54] <Saphymew> are you talking about the ppl who realize they're playing with you during/after the match, or the snipers who are intentionally trying to ruin your experience?
[2022-12-03 17:57:56] <+Dionysus207> Have you tried to do offline streaks and compare it to live ones? @otzdarva
[2022-12-03 17:57:57] <TheRahn> I just don't understand why the streak attracts snipers
[2022-12-03 17:57:58] <OnyoNori> maybe instead of off stream, you could do huge stream delays. So we can still watch but there is no way for stream sniping
[2022-12-03 17:58:06] <+BDice42> Your sanity comes first

[2022-12-03 18:02:20] <LoopzeraSF> Why when i play survivor my teammates are potatos and when i play killer thy are p100 with 5000hours?
[2022-12-03 18:02:20] <twitchviewerTokie> i wish there was a setting to make knight's M2 a hold like spirit
[2022-12-03 18:02:23] <%Zearro> healing just seems really out of control. if it take a lot of effort for a killer to get a hit then it should take almost equal effort to heal that hit
[2022-12-03 18:02:24] <w0nderlord02> Camping and tunneling is fun , it’s a part of the game @otzdarva
[2022-12-03 18:02:25] <casual_lucy> just let Knight call Assasin and have them walk around hand in hand

[2022-12-03 18:03:53] <lvfernando> In a way it's worse to be the person not being tunneled because you just sit on gens and never get chases

[2022-12-03 18:08:24] <reynard8925> Have you ever tried running through a pallet while the carnifex is breaking it? It seems like it happens fast enough that the animation isn't done by the time you can go through.

[2022-12-03 18:08:55] <Saphymew> @ghoestie_ yeah i still think to some degree they do it because they love it, even with pokemon, there's ppl who berate every single thing they've done for the past 10 years, but i think it's because they just want the magic of when they first played to be recreated

[2022-12-03 18:11:47] <+ryo3000> @Otzdarva Imo the problem with dbd is that the "intended" gameplay expects a lot of "Play Nice", without punishing for not doing so or rewarding for doing so. Players shouldn't abuse certain things, but... why wouldn't they?
[2022-12-03 18:11:53] <Baleroc1> @thewitchbeech Curious what is the right mindset? I think it really frustrating when I'm Bronze 3 for instance, playing against Rank 1 players and killers because of my MMR, depipping if I don't play perfectly or optimal. The ranked system is really flawed

[2022-12-03 18:19:07] <bigdaddykhepri> I wouldn't be mad if they made it impossible to fully heal yourself, like only 99
[2022-12-03 18:19:12] <%Helix_D2> about 10% of your matches have atleast 3 medkits AND 1 boon

[2022-12-03 18:19:35] <Usiaeli> nurse should heal survivors :)
[2022-12-03 18:19:38] <craqkeda> Playing as killer?

[2022-12-03 18:20:01] <GeorgeWashingtonFanCam> imo nurse is balanced because if she isn't the strongest killer in the game, the game would be ptw.

[2022-12-03 18:24:09] <%DaddyF1LTH> Otz - the only reason anything happens in DBD is because you said it on video Kappa
[2022-12-03 18:24:10] <InflnityBlack> wouldn't be the first time you point out something is good/ broken and we start seeing a lot more people do it

[2022-12-03 18:24:12] <+SPT_Golden7up> @Otzdarva Yeah Otz, tell Bubbas that they don't need to camp to win surely they'll listen right? LULW
[2022-12-03 18:24:12] <paydohswife> @Otzdarva why are some of your killer profiles red and some aren't
[2022-12-03 18:24:15] <@%+stallioid> You got camping knights because knight is good at camping, not because otz made a video
[2022-12-03 18:24:17] <Szerg0n> This killer is twins v2 of course people gonna see it and camp

[2022-12-03 18:24:37] <%xYukiatsu> He literally abandoned his teammates
[2022-12-03 18:24:42] <%SirPoggy> makes the game super unfun and unchallenging for both sides when someone DCs at the first sign of trouble

[2022-12-03 18:24:45] <RilesTheMachine> @paydohswife that is legacy prestige reward, every killer before the new update he prestiged, so he has red
[2022-12-03 18:24:47] <GrimmyJunior1232> @romannblunts The devs straight-up said that camping/tunnelling/etc, while unfun on the receiving end, are necessary for the game to function.

I get tilted and frustrated and I say things I don't mean I'm trying to do better and improve as a person, but I obviously have moments where I fail I'll do better to look at the positives of the game and devs. again I just wanted to say sorry

This wouldn't quite work by simply detecting high hitrates. Instead a detection system for such cheats should compare sudden influxes of increased skill check hitrate between games (and whether they continue consistently)

[2022-12-03 18:40:46] <%+Cdognkal> I love playing Knight but you have to play so mean to make use of the power
[2022-12-03 18:40:48] <andypandy2211> Damn lets go nea, that was a good chase
[2022-12-03 18:40:48] <a_true_survivor> I probably have gotten better watching you otz than actually playing the game
[2022-12-03 18:40:50] <BenOfMilam> this is a great place to camp lol
[2022-12-03 18:40:52] <kola_play> No, it's not bug because breakable walls has some scratch-holes or how to call them. They're not the whole
[2022-12-03 18:40:53] <tater_tot_casserole> How could solo queue get buffed? Add more to basekit? Like kindred?

[2022-12-03 18:41:13] <edouard818> What was Freddy’s rework?
[2022-12-03 18:41:17] <%+silentknightkos> Honestly just give solo q Bond already and show your teammates perks
[2022-12-03 18:41:18] <vollkeinplan> they should show the killer in the lobby who is teamed up, so if I play ghostface I can dodge a 4 man
[2022-12-03 18:41:23] <Laranjow> add voice chat?
[2022-12-03 18:41:24] <@%CptCrunch_> ValzInSpanish he is too busy tunneling

[2022-12-03 18:41:35] <$DanyR> @jplaysxo Currently the advantage of voice chat is very high.
[2022-12-03 18:41:36] <%+violetmoons856> @Laranjow this would be so toxic
[2022-12-03 18:41:36] <%+Sh4dow014> status icons on the hud
[2022-12-03 18:41:38] <w0nderlord02> You have a P100 Plague , did you choose her cause she’s cute to you or are you good with her  ??? @otzdarva

[2022-12-03 18:41:43] <CrispyCoat> Do you think SWF is op or not really then if that’s the case?
[2022-12-03 18:41:44] <Zeroabrs> they should just buff kindred itself and let solo see the perks like you said instead of base kit kindred
[2022-12-03 18:41:44] <+lovewomans1312> that would be huge to see who has prove thyself and delivirence
[2022-12-03 18:41:45] <jackalfang240> being able to see my teams perks as a solo would be so good
[2022-12-03 18:41:46] <champrath> people would dodge lobbies till they find meta persk though
[2022-12-03 18:41:47] <SzamanB3> seeing perks in esc menu would be nice
[2022-12-03 18:41:47] <$MagicalMonkey100> a minor ping system for solo queue?
[2022-12-03 18:41:50] <@%CptCrunch_> @stallioid that guy clearly never put his hands on a Fromsoftware or Bethesda game. Or any RPG for the matter of fact lmao

[2022-12-03 18:41:50] <%3ggs_n_b4con> If you play solo, and only if you play solo: You can use hatch and GGNM
[2022-12-03 18:41:51] <@%ValzInSpanish> @Player2ony I would love to run around with a pokey stick giggling
[2022-12-03 18:41:56] <%Chrillbill> @w0nderlord02 She's one of his favorite killers
[2022-12-03 18:41:57] <tater_tot_casserole> Seeing my teammates perks would be so good. I feel bad when I have a totem breaking challenge, but there’s a booner in the group tismSad
[2022-12-03 18:41:58] <%+CameoDisappearance> Rather than giving solo Q special advantages I think I'd like to see the addition of pings for your team. Huge amount of SWF advantage just comes from "She's chasing me, do gens"
[2022-12-03 18:42:00] <+weaky_repz> add post game voice chat 😈😈
[2022-12-03 18:42:03] <@%CptCrunch_> Bring back old Freddy
[2022-12-03 18:42:04] <d_b_cooper__> just give solos voice chat so they are at the same level as a SWF team

[2022-12-03 18:42:19] <Qwas_Blank> i remember on old freddy everybody would go for reveal speed but big brain Otz went for range and it was so 5Head
[2022-12-03 18:42:20] <InvisiPhyre> I would love for my solo teammates to be able to see that! That's sounds amazing to play with
[2022-12-03 18:42:20] <%+ellmo24> what difference would it make to show SWFs the perks? They aready know. So in lobby if survivors perks were displayed that would be a good fix.
[2022-12-03 18:42:22] <%bhiliktika> I played spirit last night and all my matches were 4ks cus no one knew what was going on

[2022-12-03 18:44:15] <andypandy2211> Ood freddie was so oppressive as well!
[2022-12-03 18:44:16] <Benski4> @Otzdarva something as simple as a indicator that tells if team mates are at gens, running, hiding etc would improve the solo expereince a lot
[2022-12-03 18:44:20] <severity21> Was it like ghost faces stalk?
[2022-12-03 18:44:20] <%bhiliktika> @olii42o you’re probably right because those matches just felt too easy
[2022-12-03 18:44:22] <%the_oracle_> @Otzdarva how would you feel if they brought old freddy back?
[2022-12-03 18:44:24] <xCandle_> @Akamatzu used to have to switch to a mode with no attack, to be able to shock lol
[2022-12-03 18:44:25] <GrimmyJunior1232> @Otzdarva Freddy's mechanical uniqueness also caused a lot of issues for newcomers that didn't understand the counter to him, which lead to his nerf after a week.
[2022-12-03 18:44:25] <SomeDwarf> Old sonar freddy was my drug, otz, it was so satisfying pinging them in old dark swamp
[2022-12-03 18:44:26] <jackalfang240> can we all agree Billy is pretty rough to an unfun degree right now at least on console
[2022-12-03 18:44:30] <ricarlee22> Solid hit
[2022-12-03 18:44:34] <+Chrismus97> what was the video called?
[2022-12-03 18:44:35] <%$fixedice913> I think it was either the z block or paint brush that pulled into the dream world a few seconds faster

[2022-12-03 18:44:36] <Set71101> old freddy was bad but i miss him simpliy because he was more original and intersting than  new
[2022-12-03 18:44:41] <$DanyR> That hit looked very weird.
[2022-12-03 18:44:45] <%+leonardo1ita> CHAT do you remember Ninja Freddy Pog?

[2022-12-03 18:44:48] <%Chrillbill> @weaky_repz I mean, sure, but I doubt many would want to have it turned on monkaHmm
[2022-12-03 18:44:48] <the_banhammer09> it lag the moment he lunge lol
[2022-12-03 18:44:49] <%+Cdognkal> Best guard in your opinion Otz?
[2022-12-03 18:44:50] <%mexican_joker__> I started playing the game just before his rework so I didn't know how to play against him Sadge

[2022-12-03 18:44:54] <+xperack> Why you hit when you go down?
[2022-12-03 18:45:00] <%+dark9087> @Otzdarva if you used his power while facing a locker you could see if someone was hiding in there because the magic stain would become bigger
[2022-12-03 18:45:02] <uakonz> those freddy add ones were my favorite
[2022-12-03 18:45:03] <PalmerDixon> how u feel about playing on a 1.0/2.0/... LIVE version (on april fool's or so)
[2022-12-03 18:45:03] <%LisaThePainful> @saffrie19 It's been good tbh~ Hope yours is noice too! otzBlushA
[2022-12-03 18:45:09] <%xYukiatsu> So you dislike the assassin
[2022-12-03 18:45:10] <+Penguinologist_> Aww not the penguin :(
[2022-12-03 18:45:11] <DeadByFlesh_Light> xperack speed
[2022-12-03 18:45:11] <kola_play> There wsa an addon that didn't survivors wake up if they miss skill check
[2022-12-03 18:45:13] <jackalfang240> I go back and watch the ninja clown video from time to time
[2022-12-03 18:45:14] <@%^Nightbot> Wanna be a filthy cheater like Otz? Go to http://otzcheats.com to find out more! otzEZ
[2022-12-03 18:45:18] <AtreyuEdits> Hey Otz! How's it goig
[2022-12-03 18:45:21] <%reallyamazingperson> @xperack it's faster, because you get lunge speed and you recover from lunge while falling
[2022-12-03 18:45:22] <+weaky_repz> OH, i would 🤤 @chrillbill
[2022-12-03 18:45:23] <Consumer_Of_Crayons> Knight does one thing really well, making loops impossible
[2022-12-03 18:45:24] <Akamatzu> @Akamatzu oh that sounds awful HypeLUL
[2022-12-03 18:45:24] <+Player2ony> my only memories of old freddy is "the one people played to farm BP"
[2022-12-03 18:45:32] <Candies_Knots> Assassin only good for speed
[2022-12-03 18:45:34] <%+Vyse_NTV> Assassin's the worst? but what about the 4.4 speed?
[2022-12-03 18:45:36] <Rennat47> assassin is the best because he makes the funniest laugh
[2022-12-03 18:45:40] <@%CptCrunch_> I got the absolute gigachad that also dualwields BHF again
[2022-12-03 18:45:43] <SomeDwarf> I think Old Freddy was just the hit and run playstyle that old DBD wasn't ready for. People would sleep and get the hit and then get looped for 5 gens instead of letting you go until you went to a weaker tile or, even better, found your friends
[2022-12-03 18:45:43] <%+egghamm> I want a magician killer

[2022-12-03 18:45:52] <GrimmyJunior1232> @Vyse_NTV Doesn't matter if he has problems detecting you and only chases for 12 seconds
[2022-12-03 18:45:57] <%+Vyse_NTV> fair enough
[2022-12-03 18:46:00] <+xperack> DeadByFlesh_Light reallyamazingperson ty guys otzPraying

[2022-12-03 18:46:06] <GoldenSonata> i don't get how the assassin is no the one that chases the most
[2022-12-03 18:46:08] <%+ShallowRocket> how come the knight can use his guards by the hook but others are limited

[2022-12-03 18:56:24] <%paleltuma> otzLove Thank you!
[2022-12-03 18:56:24] <%destrium_dreamboy> Sadako is very dependent of the tv spawns, a bit too much
[2022-12-03 18:56:25] <@%CptCrunch_> @paleltuma thanks for showing me the trash
[2022-12-03 18:56:26] <%+CameoDisappearance> My biggest issue with Sadako is a lore thing. How come getting rid of your condemned turns off a TV? The whole point of the lore is that sharing the story is how you survive. Shouldn't that turn the TV on if you put a tape in??

[2022-12-03 19:00:29] <DireRaven41> for me playing without addons or with pretty minor ones is much funnier than olaying with good addons
[2022-12-03 19:00:30] <%+wolfspiritdl> honestly i dont see why people complain that much about blight. if a player is THAT good at a character, they deserve the down/win
[2022-12-03 19:00:30] <%ARomanticAce> @iriswinter i see, very good aroman2Axe
[2022-12-03 19:00:30] <+Nickhillcomedy> bots would at least be another body in the game which is always a plus for survivors
[2022-12-03 19:00:35] <%+TheBloatingGlobe> It's funny, because on DbD mobile, when people DC they are replaced by bots. Including the killer as far as I know.

[2022-12-03 19:00:42] <+cdw138> Does blight need an add-on rework then?
[2022-12-03 19:00:43] <%$rojizamariscos> bots are actually so good, their ai would work great with people that dc
[2022-12-03 19:00:44] <+Themillion> and allow a killed player to take control of a bot when they die

[2022-12-03 19:01:26] <Jeremiahisntmyname> Yeah for me, the biggest obstacle to a killer is how close their base kit is to the standard killer stats. It’s so much harder to play a killer with lower speed because it’s so much more punishing when you’re learning the power
[2022-12-03 19:01:26] <+ryanthewise_> sounds toxic as shit

[2022-12-03 19:01:41] <+sonecattv> We used to do that in CSGO. If we got a toxic player, we would kick him and use the bot that replaceed him
[2022-12-03 19:01:45] <+MinisterOfSpaceyStuff> Cheater dies, DCs another player, and takes them over.
[2022-12-03 19:01:46] <+xTheSwiftNinjax> @sophiuh_ Spirit has almost no restriction to her movement. Blight has a incredibly fast but restricted type of movement.

[2022-12-03 19:03:33] <%ARomanticAce> @sophiuh_ yeah, but blight (using his slams well) has a longer range at that speed than spirit has in general. i think spirit probably could be 115 without breaking the game, but it's also true that if blight *doesn't* use his slams well, it's a lot less forgiving than, say, overshooting a phase walk.

[2022-12-03 19:06:12] <Migzo> hobbHi
[2022-12-03 19:06:15] <ririnkaArt> the viewers that encourage him, guilt trip him etc are the problem and people need to talk about them more than about him
[2022-12-03 19:06:16] <forbiddencello> Survivor friend groups would make a shapeshifting killer useless @electric_fan12
[2022-12-03 19:06:16] <a_true_survivor> @a_true_survivor well i thought he was from forhonor? but i guess i was wrong
[2022-12-03 19:06:17] <%+ThisDonut> just add his name to the auto filter
[2022-12-03 19:06:19] <$Rarehunter_Aja> new Haddonfield looks great, but I miss the old layout

I’d love to see dbd ytbers to upload „f*ck up“ montages. That’d be great bc you wouldn’t feel so bad anymore when u also have a bad day.

[2022-12-03 19:11:02] <%+Humble9> kate got hit
[2022-12-03 19:11:03] <the_banhammer09> is there plans for jason voorhese to added as a killer
[2022-12-03 19:11:17] <%lordmacewick> Sadako buff idea: The more condemn a survivor has the more slowdown they have to gens and healing and whatnot
[2022-12-03 19:11:22] <PlutosProtege> is knight from ds or for honor
[2022-12-03 19:11:23] <GrimmyJunior1232> @s_mug In travel time, that's anywhere from 8 seconds ~ 19 seconds + 2 sec animation, so 10 ~ 21 seconds. So it's either pathetic or surprisingly decent.
[2022-12-03 19:11:30] <Kelsier___> do you enjoy the knights playstyle
[2022-12-03 19:11:30] <champrath> yea assasin got a hit on her
[2022-12-03 19:11:35] <grayski32> @auste_n And have the Primis crew as survivors. The COD zombies DLC would be the 1st one with 4 survivors released
[2022-12-03 19:11:36] <%+AlexanderLXIX> @PlutosProtege neither
[2022-12-03 19:11:36] <jackalfang240> @the_banhammer09 as far as we are aware no but I hope so
[2022-12-03 19:11:40] <!%itsjustTOGA> Sadako buff idea, the tv spawns 50 additional sadakos
[2022-12-03 19:11:40] <valentian> @PlutosProtege neither, they're original
[2022-12-03 19:11:41] <%almightygoots> Weird pitch, DBZ in DbD. Goku can instant transmission between gens as survivor, but Perfect Cell can absorb 1 survivor (like Tombstone)
[2022-12-03 19:11:42] <%seweropossum21> @the_banhammer09 no
[2022-12-03 19:11:46] <%Chrillbill> @PlutosProtege Original killer, apparently inspired by For Honor

[2022-12-03 19:15:19] <%+CameoDisappearance> @dislreport I think this map, like a lot of the newer designs, swings wildly on who it favors depending on RNG and which killer it is. A killer with good camp that gets a hook in the street, well, that's GG.

[2022-12-03 19:15:54] <yet_another_lucas> @Otzdarva Will you stream signalis any time soon? You are like 3 hours from finishing the game ever since the 1st stream!

[2022-12-03 19:17:04] <%+CameoDisappearance> @dislreport There's a lot of context I don't get from that, like who the survivors are, how good you are as killer, etc etc. I will say that solo Q is basically roulette, and this map benefits from coordination because of all the buildings. I can see it being rougher for solo

[2022-12-03 19:20:15] <lemurkatta> Hello Otz & chat! i live in eu and yesterday i had a match where all 4 survivors had 300+ ping and everything was 1 sec late. All other matches before and after were fine. Could they be from America or something? But how could that even happen? Like i'm sure we have a huge player base here. Is it a common issue in dbd? Or was i just unlucky? Thoughts
[2022-12-03 19:20:21] <$DanyR> So undeserved tbh.

[2022-12-03 19:36:07] <%$TheSoupStar> @Otzdarva I took a 4-5 month break from the game, and I feel like survivors bring WAY more items than they did half a year ago. I have had like 4 consecutive games where gens finish before I can walk to them. Is this a recent trend or just bad luck? I have been having an easier time winning as solo survivor than killer.

[2022-12-03 19:36:19] <%+Rlaur> @Rlaur @Varodra Any killer would just hit/down Cheryl and continue to go for the other, it would've saved like 15 seconds max, whereas she could've been on a gen for that entire chase. I think it's the wrong play everytime.

[2022-12-03 19:38:20] <thewitchbeech> since that episode of hardcore I always check there for hatch
[2022-12-03 19:38:20] <+acesound101> Wait hatch spawns that close to the edge of the map?
[2022-12-03 19:38:21] <%Lamptus> @Otzdarva Do you find low battery sounds scary?
[2022-12-03 19:38:21] <Fallen_Gabriella> Oh yeah, "spawn at main building" on this map means "spawn in the backyard".

[2022-12-03 19:38:24] <+T0schiba> Heeey Otz! Does a guard counts as a "killer" for Monstrous Shrine?

What do you think about hyperfocus removing the great skill check requirement, but it creates skill checks only 2x the size of a great skill check, the skill check increase starts immediately, spawns more skill checks, and the progress bonus is reduced to compensate?

[2022-12-03 19:55:31] <NuclearTitbit> @Otzdarva What do you think of refunding unused addons/offerings/items for bloodpoints, like 5%-10% of the cost? So they don't clog your inventory. Maybe devs can even collect data to improve unwanted addons?
[2022-12-03 19:55:34] <%$TheSoupStar> @Otzdarva I have found that if you don't have the patrol range addon, survivors can very easily just run from loop to loop to loop whenever you use your power.
[2022-12-03 19:55:35] <%revanmalicose> have you ever decided to pick a favorite at the beginning of the game and never hurt them for no reason? it's the most fun thing to do sometimes

[2022-12-03 20:05:01] <+mrhalloween311> Why does the knight have hair coming out of his helmet where his eyes should be?
[2022-12-03 20:05:04] <dragomainpath> if pokemon is a kid's game and dildos are grown people's toys... what about pokemon dildos? ._.

[2022-12-03 20:05:16] <$imahungrymf> ‘Pokemon is for kids im a grown adult i play call of duty’ is one way to show your insecurities
[2022-12-03 20:05:18] <+ForgottenGhost1988> I feels like most people I play with TTV in their name don't actually stream anymore :(
[2022-12-03 20:05:22] <%slashstr33tboy> Knight is fun but still pretty clunky in regards to input
[2022-12-03 20:05:22] <bruhblanco> callisto protocol has some problems but it's probably a solid game not my thing though
[2022-12-03 20:05:22] <josph2323> did you ever play deadspace? calisto is similar
[2022-12-03 20:05:22] <%ARomanticAce> @Its_The_Doug i still think p3 pyramid head is a forgotten powerwash simulator level, lol
[2022-12-03 20:05:24] <%RandoHawkins> @dragomainpath that's some sound logic

[2022-12-03 20:05:31] <%pillowtalk42> it’s made by the same guy who made dead space @otzdarva
[2022-12-03 20:05:31] <some1joodontknowof> Callisto seems amazing but the pc port was done poorly and for the time being it's stuttering hard
[2022-12-03 20:05:32] <@%CptCrunch_> @Otzdarva So Twins working properly and thus no longer working due to bugs was one of the annoying bugs about Knight? NOTED
[2022-12-03 20:05:33] <Nozdrum> callisto protocol is basically a less fun dead space. no horror just gore
[2022-12-03 20:05:33] <NailedMan> Knight DID get buff

You'd be surprised how often you can kick a gen, see someone hiding, then pretend to leave and let them activate dragon's grip then turn around.

[2022-12-03 20:09:39] <+sheoVAL> his adept was the hardest of all the killers for me
[2022-12-03 20:09:42] <Zydson331> imo a good buff to the knight would be to make some basic actions like destroy a pallet/wall/kick or go forward a little available to do without going into the patrol path mode but still being able to set patrol for a larger area with a different button.
[2022-12-03 20:09:42] <MouthWide0pen> actually the knight is k tier. the k is for knight

[2022-12-03 20:09:56] <%+Killercheesepuff2> I think it's because knight can sometimes guarantee hits and can interrupt healing easily so sloppy must get goof value

[2022-12-03 20:19:43] <%gnolex86> Eruption is extremely unhealthy for the game right now.

[2022-12-03 20:19:45] <Zydson331> eruption should work like pain res so its not unfair for soloq players
[2022-12-03 20:19:46] <bubblegumhand> What why did she think that would work
[2022-12-03 20:19:46] <mareacz> its been two days without you. i already missed you BibleThump TwitchUnity
[2022-12-03 20:19:47] <noskiuwu> Maybe the gen gets blocked by the entity instead of giving incapacitated?
[2022-12-03 20:19:47] <%Mystoc> why not just buff solo que so they can tell im about to go down with pings
[2022-12-03 20:19:50] <aaaiib> eruption perfectly balanced imo

[2022-12-03 20:20:02] <ButtonsTV> awe no it was a crow
[2022-12-03 20:20:03] <LambSauceTV> The incapacitate effect is a bit much
[2022-12-03 20:20:06] <josph2323> i think its reverse. its ineffective vs swf but effective vs soloq.

[2022-12-03 20:20:11] <$arok_nya> 90 sec gens feels already horrible imagine 100 seconds on gen xD

[2022-12-03 20:20:12] <crrishh> Eruption is cracked against non swf

[2022-12-03 20:20:21] <%Mystoc> add ping wheel to say what your doing
[2022-12-03 20:20:21] <DeoNone> it's still powerful against teams imo
[2022-12-03 20:20:21] <%BrokenHal> What if they added in game voice chat for survivors?
[2022-12-03 20:20:22] <ironfire286> its very annoying, yes
[2022-12-03 20:20:28] <aaaiib> anything that is good for killer = tragic and unfair
[2022-12-03 20:20:30] <mgsfan83> Yeah.....  Cause it's always easy to call out when you're about to go down.  LUL  I guess it is if you're new to the game
[2022-12-03 20:20:31] <jakob12345op> eruption is scary good
[2022-12-03 20:20:31] <Hexy_93> Tap the gen ig
[2022-12-03 20:20:32] <%+TDrog> give it a repair slow, thana style, for 20sec
[2022-12-03 20:20:32] <G1pnozOfficial> just got gf on otzdarva com, better than real
[2022-12-03 20:20:33] <bluerosiebun> Eruption needs a change not a nerf. I just dont want the devs to nerf part of it and not buff another part of it.
[2022-12-03 20:20:35] <%+kris2340k> why it doesnt damage the gen instead idk
[2022-12-03 20:20:39] <blackestbird3> @grimmyjunior1232 sounds good but not better than old Pop IMO
[2022-12-03 20:20:41] <%champrath> @otzdarva just make it 12 seconds and make the regression maybe %18? seems balanced
[2022-12-03 20:20:42] <CtrlAltDel337> how about it gives you an oppression-style skill check, that if you fail it incapacitates you for the same amount of time
[2022-12-03 20:20:43] <+LemieMelon> make blast mine stop killers from kicking gens for 10 seconds :)
[2022-12-03 20:20:44] <noskiuwu> Pain res is alright imo from both perspectives

[2022-12-03 20:45:22] <ObsidianSin> @noskiuwu because they were in such a precarious position and he wanted to use all of his power before it ran out

[2022-12-03 20:45:26] <FieldAgentReaper> @Griffures its when any hex is cleansed

[2022-12-03 20:46:11] <+DJ_Wetwilly> @bazingah_boy also, if you know the killer has franklins, you can drop your item and go back to it when you get injured
[2022-12-03 20:46:15] <%+RyznPB> theyve cleansed 3 totems and you still have Retri so yeah
[2022-12-03 20:46:18] <+lambogee> why would that be boring gameplay

[2022-12-03 20:46:51] <+RainyFaye> Just the nature of the game.
[2022-12-03 20:46:52] <noskiuwu> @SolariumGarden I know but it just encourages more of this kinda thing in the game

[2022-12-03 20:47:11] <+DJ_Wetwilly> @bazingah_boy then drop/ hide the item and go back when you need to heal.  pretty easy
[2022-12-03 20:47:13] <linkestein95> Question,  what happens if a survivor was cleansing a totem and that totem become plaything?Can they finish cleansing it or are they kicked out of it by that timer that onky the afected survivor can cleanse?

So there are blocked power in inventory when you are playing as the killer, but on the survivour side you have on the same spot switchable items, so what if there won't be blocked power icon on the killer side and you could choose the power you want to use on the killer/ For example on oni you can use his own in-game abilitty or change it on power that will help to track survivours. I know that this will be expensive but what about one killer

[2022-12-03 21:05:17] <+crowell131> The only perk I usually get value from with knight perks is nowhere to hide with occasional hubris
[2022-12-03 21:05:17] <BuriedHate> i feel like it doesnt even workmthe way its supposed to
[2022-12-03 21:05:20] <ItsMeClassics> relax theres still 3 gens left XD
[2022-12-03 21:05:23] <%itsPuch> I'm curious about nowhere to hide perk, do you think it would be essential to Gen Kicking Builds? would it be as fine as BBQ and Chili?
[2022-12-03 21:05:26] <%slashstr33tboy> Would stealth billy work with this?
[2022-12-03 21:05:29] <+T3R1O> Face the darkness always activates on oblivious survivors, so maybe i doesn't with doctor fake TR
[2022-12-03 21:05:32] <andreeinthevoid> @andreeinthevoid but int builds dont allow summons as far as i remember right?
[2022-12-03 21:05:32] <jakob12345op> are you fulltime streamer
[2022-12-03 21:05:32] <Veyrawn> i feel legion with oblivious build + face the darkness is pretty good
[2022-12-03 21:05:33] <Kenpo_KId> Its fantastic on legion
[2022-12-03 21:05:33] <GrimmyJunior1232> @Otzdarva Doc's illusion TR isn't considered a TR in any form. Only false TR that IS considered a TR for perks would be Dark Devotion

[2022-12-03 21:07:23] <a_chanel_knockoff> i only ever really notice the killer has this perk when i get to the endscreen, or when it makes survivors who have already left the match scream, which it does for some reason
[2022-12-03 21:07:23] <+king_kramp> is there a good way to counter boon heals and medkit teams?
[2022-12-03 21:07:24] <%+Logique_> @pumpkintiramisu he doesn't really need anything extra, he already has no tr in nightfall and also loses it while teleporting
[2022-12-03 21:07:24] <+Chrismus97> map offerings should prevent me from playing on a certain map
[2022-12-03 21:07:28] <Zydson331> @unlimited_mileage shattered hope has a hidden effect that makes you never play against people with boons
[2022-12-03 21:07:34] <hatman4422> @otzdarva Interesting idea, remove 1 year of survivors lifespan after kicking the boon? Should make placing it more risky
[2022-12-03 21:07:40] <%+DrMagsC> Ooooh gotcha thank you!
[2022-12-03 21:07:47] <$JingoJaden> I think that is the major problem with circle of healing. All other boons are only effective if they are near killers. Boon circle of healing is best if it is away from the killer.

[2022-12-03 21:08:37] <%NightBIayde> Wouldn't merciless storm work with face the darkness, maybe with dms so when they scream they fail the skill checks and it locks the gen. Not sure which killer this would work best on though Hmm

[2022-12-03 21:11:15] <%+Zorasknight> Seems like I'm getting higher ping matches lately as killer, I think they expanded match making to lower US killer queue times
[2022-12-03 21:11:20] <%NightBIayde> Would be interesting to see though
[2022-12-03 21:11:25] <andreeinthevoid> im pretty sure its a predatory tactic tho, maybe not a scam but not something we should ignore
[2022-12-03 21:11:29] <bazkera> the limited skins in LoL are worth alot now :-D and having a skin nobody else has is always nice in games

[2022-12-03 21:11:36] <PetroleumCrusader> I heard that those cosmetics will be back next year, is that confirmed or just something people assume?
[2022-12-03 21:11:36] <MightyLev> @Otzdarva Respectfully, I disagree: it's absolutely a scam tactic; they're saying you can buy them for non-cash *AFTER* they're no longer available to buy.

[2022-12-03 21:11:44] <PracticalRook> @Otzdarva Would dead hard be better if it had a short windup time? Force survivors to predict a hit further out?

[2022-12-03 21:12:10] <ahomelessmannamedfred> @GrimmyJunior1232 how's it going grimmy?
[2022-12-03 21:12:15] <%FalcoLambda> all DCs are map offerings but not all map offerings are DCs, or something. idk.
[2022-12-03 21:12:15] <$zesty4u> bring auto dead hard to beta
[2022-12-03 21:12:22] <$JingoJaden> I think the main problem of the perk is that it rewards survivors for bad plays, and punishes killers for good plays.
[2022-12-03 21:12:31] <jakob12345op> what do you think about pinhead
[2022-12-03 21:12:32] <%+Zorasknight> Yo @Otzdarva does hex face the darkness cause survivors to let go of gens?
[2022-12-03 21:12:34] <LumenSagee> I think limited time skins try to exploit people's fear of missing out so they'll spend money immediately rather than like waiting for their next paycheck or something
[2022-12-03 21:12:35] <josph2323> that would make it impossible to use it dodge a hit which is entire point of the perk.
[2022-12-03 21:12:38] <M7MDxMFDY> @FalcoLambda wait hol up ur actually onto something
[2022-12-03 21:12:39] <%+Logique_> @mightylev so what? they're not obligated to allow you to buy stuff with shards in the first place. they owe you nothing

[2022-12-03 21:13:00] <Kenpo_KId> Also Otz its pointless to run undying with this perk, its really hard to cleanse anyway since the location is always changing. Undying is a waste of a slot IMO. In all the games I've used this perk its been cleansed once
[2022-12-03 21:13:03] <%ARomanticAce> lmaoooo

[2022-12-03 21:19:08] <hatman4422> @torch18 I mean you should get used to knowing if you have enough distance to make it to another pallet, if you are new, its something you will quickly get used to. Best time to leave a loop is when he is kicking the pallet, doe

[2022-12-03 21:26:32] <+Travis848> @otzdarva I have an idea for the knight, what do you think about infinite patrol range but sacrifice the guard being only able to patrol it once, which rewards longer patrols and not drop down patrols in loops

[2022-12-03 21:31:43] <%+Angry_Andrea> @Otzdarva anticlimatic funny ish story, last week i asked you about DS vs the hook getting priority.... that night i started watching your 50 win streak videos and on the clown one someone asked the same question and you answered it in the vid... funny for me while watching but maybe annoying for you to answer questions over and over
[2022-12-03 21:31:43] <robensate> chase duration addon is so good, such a shame i have so little of those addons... like 20 are left, so sad

[2022-12-03 21:31:50] <+brokenf4t3> Are you recommending to pick up The Plauge after smth around 50h of playing killer? I dont have all perks, but doing pretty decent at iridescent 1
[2022-12-03 21:31:53] <jakob12345op> there should be a range to hooks in my oppinion

[2022-12-03 21:32:03] <l3vi1607> Pyramid head with I’m all hears, call of brine, eruption and a nurses calling or enduring?
[2022-12-03 21:32:12] <slavik_3248> It’s sometimes a better idea to a guard outside line of sight of a hook so it reacts to unhook and doesn’t disappear

[2022-12-03 21:49:25] <nathan12670_> @otzdarva the bots know where you are going to throw before you throw it so they always perfectly dodge . It’s more infuriating than actual people
[2022-12-03 21:49:25] <3v1l_br1ckz> like bots are good at teaching you to punish vaults. but they'll dodge even pyrahead through walls and stuff.

[2022-12-03 21:55:32] <Vivythehuntress69> It'd be cool if Bill had some Legendary skins from other Valve games like Gordon Freeman from HL or Chell from Portal

[2022-12-03 21:55:48] <The_Dark_Wall> sadako's pallet vault away grab is pretty funny @Otzdarva
[2022-12-03 21:55:48] <%+Crimok> 5 hour locker grabbing video with every killer^^
[2022-12-03 21:55:49] <%$puphyberry> @mokniker aah, I see <_> I don't see why else Hyperfocus would stop seeing use so much, Wesker is still pretty popular right
[2022-12-03 21:55:51] <Tic4tac> !streak
[2022-12-03 21:55:52] <@%^Nightbot> Otz is slowly attempting to get 50 wins in a row (3 or 4 kills) as several Killers. At the moment, he's practicing Wesker, Sadako and Dredge to bring them to 25 wins. Check the status & full rules here: https://bit.ly/2zMWXqk

[2022-12-03 21:56:11] <ghostkiller166tf> @otzdarva I think they should make all of his soldiers 1 soldier who's a combination a all 3 and you can change it's strength with add-ons

[2022-12-03 21:56:38] <darkii347> its funny how devs bring killer out line ringu and knight who are trash and then ask why no one play them

[2022-12-03 21:56:43] <%+Melessos> Hey otz have you tried pinhead with hubris ?
[2022-12-03 21:56:45] <mokniker> @puphyberry Because it was overrated. I did the math on a few average games and found it took about 10 seconds average off all gens, that's only slightly better than a brown toolbox with 2 perk slots
