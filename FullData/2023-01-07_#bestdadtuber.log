[2023-01-07 09:23:30] <%cherrimode> playing multiple roles is fun but exhausting. Escipally with costume changes
[2023-01-07 09:23:56] <%The0wlchemist> @cherrimode So true. Especially when it's a very casual kind of production, so costumes aren't designed for quick changes
[2023-01-07 09:23:57] <%cherrimode> luckily I'm good at improv
[2023-01-07 09:24:28] <%The0wlchemist> During a past production one of the main ballerinas had her tutu fall off mid-number due to quick change mishapes. She handled it like a pro though
