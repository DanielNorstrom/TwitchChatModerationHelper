[2022-12-19 16:59:52] <%+dw33z1l> Have a new drop, Dolphin's Heart, that has like a 5% drop rate. That way you can store and eat them like gapples
[2022-12-19 16:59:56] <!%4tw0ne> Or just make it so depth strider cancels grace
[2022-12-19 16:59:58] <%+xBuckeyex> we should be able to saddle mount dolphins. just sayin
[2022-12-19 17:00:02] <%GatMoose> Feeding the dolphin sounds like a euphemism
