[2022-12-23 04:18:07] <shauntungosaurus> @shauntungosaurus in order to get a crunch out of something that was once a marshmallow, you would need to burn it to ash, compress that ash into a little block, do it again like 20 times until youve got enough material, and then hydraulic press it into a brick of carbon. you will not get a crunch before that point!
