[2022-12-11 03:47:39] <%+TenEightyFifty> !yulha
[2022-12-11 03:47:39] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3
[2022-12-11 03:47:39] <%+dekupopo> Happy Holidays :)

[2022-12-11 04:10:08] <%+shloots> i voted for brazil :)
[2022-12-11 04:10:08] <%JLue> awoooo
[2022-12-11 04:10:08] <DaarkPaladinX> Yeah, I think the issue with torrent set is that not only you need really good rolls to make up for lacking the crit stat from the crit set, but it's only used in cleave teams.  A lot of bruisers usually do not want torrent because of the hp% decrease drawback.
[2022-12-11 04:10:09] <%+Xefender7> I voted Brazil for Samuh

[2022-12-11 04:10:31] <mingshi08> most people new to the ame probably voted the higher percentage cause they dont even klnow
[2022-12-11 04:10:45] <DaarkPaladinX> Even running torrent set on def% scaling bruisers may backfire on you because you lose out on hp% tankiness.

[2022-12-11 04:35:21] <%TheGameplayHub> !yulha
[2022-12-11 04:35:21] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-11 04:44:38] <+P___S> !Yulha
[2022-12-11 04:44:38] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3
[2022-12-11 04:44:41] <+alephnull7861> dudes actually picking melissa

[2022-12-11 05:08:19] <%TheGameplayHub> !yulha
[2022-12-11 05:08:19] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-11 05:26:55] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-11 06:47:57] <sleapyeagle> who would believe that once upon a time arbiter vildred was the most broken unit in the game
[2022-12-11 06:47:59] <BeeConsumer500k> aol in play and aol out of play are totally different games and the game with her in play is just infinitely worse
[2022-12-11 06:48:00] <xale1999> its probably just alot slower
[2022-12-11 06:48:03] <dyamond> no one knows, nobody picked that unit

[2022-12-11 08:04:20] <truong13594> !yulha
[2022-12-11 08:04:20] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-11 08:20:03] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-11 09:05:36] <JesterBre> My husband is big into this game and I’m trying to decide if I can get into it too. It’s the easiest game to play for him while taking care of our newborn. Lol he’d always talking about it and I’m trying to understand it more. Would it be an okay game for somewhat casual play? World Arena aside? Sorry for another question!

[2022-12-11 11:16:03] <%Pupper75> you didn't like DS1?
[2022-12-11 11:16:04] <gregguluzian> If you like bloodbourne, have you tired elden ring? It won game of the year

[2022-12-11 11:16:14] <Deaddovedonoteat> the setting in bb is so fantastic
[2022-12-11 11:16:19] <%+r_jorjo> Jena Dex build have always been the best in bloodborne cos Dex increases visceral attack dmg
[2022-12-11 11:16:19] <%Pupper75> i think it didn't age well
[2022-12-11 11:16:20] <%rein_kraus> @gregguluzian He beat it
