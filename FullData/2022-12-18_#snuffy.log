[2022-12-18 23:00:04] <ZanzibarTwitch> They sacrificed detail and lighting for raw animation power
[2022-12-18 23:00:05] <Nixulous> Its a paradox of colorful donut shapes that go faster than sound. Like some kind of weird interdimensional gods that compete forever.
[2022-12-18 23:00:06] <uknowmep> I think that was a similar scenario for the pokemon sun and moon anime
[2022-12-18 23:00:08] <!%$lugEdit> sometimes having more depth and perspective with detail bars you from moving them in weird ways
