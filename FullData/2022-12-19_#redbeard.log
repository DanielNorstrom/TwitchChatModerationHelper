[2022-12-19 11:06:30] <%+DawalHS> pool 3 dracula discard you basically play morbius on 2, lockjaw on 3, drac on 4, then cycle your discard cards on the lockjaw lane, hopefully discarding apocalypse a bunch of times, giving you a massive morbius and drac by the end of the game
[2022-12-19 11:06:30] <%+deformedpoet> oh i need to watch that show

[2022-12-19 11:43:08] <%Grognosh2> Fusion is a nuclear reaction that combines two atoms to create one or more new atoms with slightly less total mass. The difference in mass is released as energy, as described by Einstein‚Äôs famous equation, E = mc2 , where energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.
[2022-12-19 11:43:38] <%+deformedpoet> fusion is a dragonball technique actually

[2022-12-19 11:44:42] <%Grognosh2> Since the speed of light is enormous, converting just a tiny amount of mass into energy ‚Äì like what happens in fusion ‚Äì produces a similarly enormous amount of energy.
[2022-12-19 11:45:05] <%Grognosh2> ChickenPANIC
[2022-12-19 11:45:20] <@%gesticulate> the speed of light is relatively large

[2022-12-19 11:48:25] <@%gesticulate> that's one of the weirdest takes on light that I have ever read
[2022-12-19 11:49:22] <%Grognosh2> okay hold up, let's bring it back to big bang and go from there
[2022-12-19 11:49:44] <%$SFWildBill> but its true - James Webb is looking at it right now, billions of years in the past
[2022-12-19 11:50:33] <%$SFWildBill> https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/albums/72177720301006030
[2022-12-19 11:50:34] <%Grognosh2> But the start of time is 13.7 billions years in the past
[2022-12-19 11:51:50] <%$SFWildBill> Besides looking farther across space than any observatory before it, the James Webb Space Telescope has another trick up its mirrors: It can look further back in time than any other telescope, observing distant stars and galaxies as they appeared 13.5 billion years ago
[2022-12-19 11:51:59] <@%gesticulate> but that light was emitted like 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles away and nothing blocked it
[2022-12-19 11:52:35] <@%gesticulate> so light was traveling very quickly and also very far
[2022-12-19 11:52:39] <!%Refugeek> anyone finding the channel way more interesting when the strimmer is not here? KEKL
[2022-12-19 11:52:51] <@%gesticulate> tiddlyBONGOPEACH MmmHmm
[2022-12-19 11:53:08] <%$SFWildBill> NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has delivered the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe so far. Webb's First Deep Field is galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, and it is teeming with thousands of galaxies ‚Äì including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared.
[2022-12-19 11:53:23] <%$SFWildBill> Its infrared light
[2022-12-19 11:54:05] <%Grognosh2> My favourite infra is infrablue :)
[2022-12-19 11:54:30] <@%gesticulate> it was originally visible light but it's source is moving away so fast that its color shifted to IR YEP
[2022-12-19 11:54:54] <%$SFWildBill> elloTrue
[2022-12-19 11:56:05] <%$SFWildBill> Is Red so sad about 0-2 that he doesnt want to come back or is his shit still fucked
[2022-12-19 11:56:31] <@%gesticulate> I think he gave up because it's not worth restarting the stream to -300 viewers for another hour or two
[2022-12-19 11:56:52] <%$SFWildBill> makes sense
[2022-12-19 11:57:24] <%Grognosh2> More probable is that at tinder match messaged him and asked to come over at once
[2022-12-19 11:59:37] <%$SFWildBill> Who could say no
[2022-12-19 11:59:57] <@%gesticulate> I say no to red every time he asks

[2022-12-19 20:38:24] <raw_ouidy> based on this comment : Some Neutral cards will appear more or less frequently, depending on their performance in a given class

[2022-12-19 21:33:00] <%bunnyhoppor> KBB24_Mamba_Forever honestly not that bad, I wasn't able to keep track of all cards though
[2022-12-19 21:33:09] <%SilasPositioning> I dozed off a couple times but it was on!

[2022-12-19 21:33:30] <Ascate2> Problem with constructed is that it feels like 6 decks played on rotation by everyone ... I miss when players didn't know what opponent had so there were surprise choices

[2022-12-19 21:33:35] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> @bunnyhoppor yeah that's what I meant. Like keeping track of all those cards woulda given me a headache.

[2022-12-19 21:36:17] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> the fact that they buffed horror shows they literally do not care about arena at all LUL
[2022-12-19 21:36:17] <+Bugatti1990> But ull only see it 1 every 50 DKs, right? RIGHT????
[2022-12-19 21:36:21] <$jensen_poe> Just gotta hope it's rarer in drafts now
[2022-12-19 21:36:47] <%$severityhs> @south_red32 Thanks for the sub my man
[2022-12-19 21:37:18] <tryingtoexist> @KBB24_Mamba_Forever they propably lowerd chances of drafting him
[2022-12-19 21:37:36] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> the BGs changes are wild. Making the toxfin tier 6 and adding another tier 6 minion with the chef murloc guy is nuts

[2022-12-19 21:38:03] <%+dannfuller> Probably because Duels was built from the start with the idea of non-collectible cards being involved, and Arena wasn't. And re-working the code for Arena to adapt it is just time/labor prohibitive.
[2022-12-19 21:38:09] <Aztixx> 7 win as a warrior Pog arena is balanced again
[2022-12-19 21:38:09] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> its going to boil down to who hits poison in lobbies LUL

[2022-12-19 21:38:18] <%SilasPositioning> the only DK cards they said they were gonna offer less are ones that generate cards, and ones that remove and build simultaneously, so there might be even more Mali Horrs
[2022-12-19 21:38:20] <%kaenni> GL Red, what are your thoughts on patch notes?
[2022-12-19 21:38:52] <tocagandopratu> Arena got a hotfix?
[2022-12-19 21:39:00] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I keep saying they should have tier 7 minions that you have to do something specific to get and the trade off is a really powerful effect. but that would be too much fun LUL
[2022-12-19 21:39:04] <%medricx> Mage still sucks I‚Äôm so sad
[2022-12-19 21:39:09] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> late game boils down to leeroys and poison

[2022-12-19 21:40:30] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> selfless should be tier 4 for the effect in all reality
[2022-12-19 21:40:42] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> and baron and bran should be tier 6 for the amount of broken stuff they do
[2022-12-19 21:41:01] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> like a couple minions could go from 6 to 5 to make it so brann and baron are tier 6
[2022-12-19 21:41:28] <!%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> I just feel like its the same 4 comps that come about in each lobby. I am about 8k usually but I dont get to play miuch
