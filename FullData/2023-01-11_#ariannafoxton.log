[2023-01-11 02:00:13] <%Order_of_Dusk> I like tattoos and some piercings, like face tattoos are fine with me although eye tattoos make me uncomfy and inner lip tattoos are pointless imo, normal piercings like ear/nose/eyebrow/lip piercings are fine although anything like ear stretchers and cheek window piercings I don't like
