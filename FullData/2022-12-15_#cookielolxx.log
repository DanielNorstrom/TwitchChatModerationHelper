[2022-12-15 17:44:53] <butterflyfx121> @saadabarra2 Ok, it is good that you use attack move. Honestly Micro is best learned by doing more than watching. Just make sure not to ever stand still auto. Always be kiting somewhere.

[2022-12-15 17:46:48] <butterflyfx121> @saadabarra2 Honestly any micro videos that do exist might not apply to you since your key setup is different. You could try loldodgegame for dodging skillshots though.

[2022-12-15 19:48:40] <%+Syluxrox> @kd_together rule of thumb is to just never engage when she has max Q stacks, or when you have a large minion wave (which goes against what you would normally do which is why people struggle). If you engage in your own wave she can stack her Q in 2 seconds and you die.
