[2022-12-23 13:50:33] <@%mdc5000> I have the Sherman Firefly and the Challenger DS at 9,7 .

[2022-12-23 13:51:33] <!%thepotek> i mean regular tanks, is it good tech tree?
[2022-12-23 13:51:42] VIEWERS: 452
[2022-12-23 13:51:51] <@%mdc5000> The Sherman Firefly is decent,consider it more as a turreted tank destroier cause its not very fast and it has limited gun depresson .Paired with the Wyvern pack plane its a wombo combo .But grinding through tech tree is kinda slow .
[2022-12-23 13:52:11] <@%mdc5000> The regular tanks tend to suffer in begginer hands because shells have no explosive in it
[2022-12-23 13:52:28] <@%mdc5000> mostly Solid Shot which means u need to know precisely where to shoot
[2022-12-23 13:52:46] <@%mdc5000> and the repair costs are noticebly increased compared to USA/Ger/USSR
[2022-12-23 13:53:05] <!%thepotek> Hmm
[2022-12-23 13:53:12] <@%mdc5000> Otherwise prettyu slow tanks,with weak hulls and decent to good penetration and turrets
