[2022-12-20 15:51:21] <%K__Bro> I would love to see venus terraformed over mars, but both are frickin hard to do
[2022-12-20 15:51:22] <Aeliel_> I don't think you would want to live there, the conditions would be terrible and your life would be under constant threat
[2022-12-20 15:51:34] <AmoArman> bro you'd think they would pack a airduster with a mars rover
[2022-12-20 15:51:35] <D3athKai> Mars will be comfortable than Earth
[2022-12-20 15:51:42] <@%$Apparentthreat> no better time to start than now YEP
[2022-12-20 15:51:47] <TheMrTomatoMan> why not an underwater base ?
[2022-12-20 15:51:53] <+stormblaz> should we not terraform moon first???
[2022-12-20 15:51:55] <Spirevipp> kurzgesagt has a video on terraforming venus
[2022-12-20 15:51:55] <%K__Bro> venus is too much co2 ah high pressure
[2022-12-20 15:52:02] <D3athKai> with terraform, any planets will be habitable
[2022-12-20 15:52:16] <+Tackler52> stage 3 Artemis is a moon base, I feel like once we get the plan together doing it a second time wouldn't be hard.
[2022-12-20 15:52:18] <+Dodgyscouser> @LokiRulez Thanks, i think skyfactory and sevtech was about as far as i have regards to experience but that was a long time ago lol

[2022-12-20 15:52:45] <+Tackler52> also because moons gravity is so low, it makes a great launching point to explore deeper
[2022-12-20 15:52:50] <Aeliel_> agreed that a moon base would be a lot easier and useful

[2022-12-20 16:40:40] <fafuja> cool
[2022-12-20 16:40:57] <@%$Apparentthreat> trovertic lmao duh. 🤦‍♂️ my b. it still seems the quest 2 doesn't support 6e. perhaps a wifi 6 AP may still have more channels for more devices which would help
[2022-12-20 16:40:59] <PureSpider> i mean the quest 2 is not heavy, so i can't see why the new valve one would be heavier

[2022-12-20 16:42:09] <DeadMrEd> Could look better? Sure, but im of the mindset not to expect amazing quality from wireless->virtual desktop viewer, so i guess i dont look at picture quality that much @trovertic

[2022-12-20 16:45:02] <kenpetto> @giantwaffle why not use the crafting calculator?
[2022-12-20 16:45:10] <%Venxuri> Getting AE2 might be realistic, but for Autocrafting you will need to make Polyethelene, than mike be a day... 4-5 kind of thing
[2022-12-20 16:45:11] <$trovertic> @Apparentthreat also just in case.. it does need to be a physical router. trying to use a wifi 6 dongle and hotspot off you pc does not work and will cause more issues than doing wifi 5

[2022-12-20 16:46:15] <traemonsta666> @ninopanda gotcha gotcha if they can match 8 hours with that video quality and same weight im sold lol, hoping for the best. thought i missed something
[2022-12-20 16:46:19] <@%$Apparentthreat> trovertic oh really? just cuz of latency? I was wondering if someone tethers their quest 2 to their PC w/ the link thing, does the headset still lose charge? I wouldn't think USB ports could supply enough power to maintain charge

[2022-12-20 16:49:07] <$trovertic> @Apparentthreat if you do usb-c to usb-c it will lose charge quite quickly. BUT if like in my case and you have a usb extension and use a usb 3.0 to usb-c converter it will hold the charge almost forever

[2022-12-20 16:49:40] <@%$Apparentthreat> trovertic like a powered extension?
[2022-12-20 16:49:40] <@%ninopanda> @traemonsta666 yeah I am on the oculus and am looking at upgrading once I move into a bigger house
[2022-12-20 16:49:49] <+stormblaz> seemd like a lot of brain power went into making a f-16
[2022-12-20 16:49:57] <$trovertic> @Apparentthreat so... oddly enough optimal use is a usb extnesion into a converter into a link cable into your headset.

[2022-12-20 16:50:54] <Ras2709> its above
[2022-12-20 16:51:06] <@%$Apparentthreat> trovertic i mean that would make sense if the extender is powered and happens to provide the minimum v and amps. I bet there are some other extenders out there that aren't providing the minimum
[2022-12-20 16:51:12] <$trovertic> @Apparentthreat yeah pretty much. usb 3.0/2.0 provides more power than a usb-c so it acts like a middle man to supply extra power or some shit like that
[2022-12-20 16:51:14] <+xxRodeo> its at the top

[2022-12-20 16:52:47] <$trovertic> @Apparentthreat for the converter Im just using one I got off amazon from cable mod, usb 3.0 male to usb-c female
[2022-12-20 16:52:50] <$JonathanLivingstonSeagull> will you eventually have a quarry?
[2022-12-20 16:52:53] <@%ninopanda> @traemonsta666 yeah my room is a shared computer room, its a bit tight for some VR.  in the new house we are looking to make a VR room separate from the computer room.

[2022-12-20 17:06:38] <+Warbeast_0> Depending where you are, some cities are fully run by Nuclear power. They use the snow to cool off the plants
[2022-12-20 17:06:48] <%rickthe_punk> the snow on the road is plow in truck than dump in snow depot ... that was just the snow of the parking lot

[2022-12-20 17:09:30] <PrimalRain> it's crazy thinking of paying for parking where you live imo though
[2022-12-20 17:09:33] <InternetPlumber> when I lived downtown my rent was 1200/mo and the parking space was 400/mo more

[2022-12-20 17:09:46] <ThatOnneGuy> Parking ramps in downtown st paul charge $2/hr, and a lot of people rent a spot and you have to pay for the entire month, so they'd be paying about $15/day. That's $450/month... for a parking space close to work
[2022-12-20 17:09:48] <macdrai> imagine, a parking space has more economic value than a human
[2022-12-20 17:09:49] <Zoinx> wtf, we pay 60$ for a parking space where I live pretty centrally in Stockholm

[2022-12-20 17:16:40] <mahoraz> yea.....apartment that was 50k is now 150k in my country
[2022-12-20 17:16:46] <prozacco> sounds american tbh
[2022-12-20 17:16:49] <%+brenner1265> You need to apply for it yourself, it was EZ in Minnesota where I have mine

[2022-12-20 17:16:55] <PureSpider> shit's convoluted on purpose so nobody notices all the exemptions for the ultra rich

[2022-12-20 17:17:21] <Zombiexm> America wont ever have simplified taxes because too many companys and ultra wealthy benifit from it being overly complicated LUL
[2022-12-20 17:17:21] <+elric689> my house went up 450% in five years when I sold in canada. made more then my actual job during that time
[2022-12-20 17:17:24] <%+Tasar_> taxes have been monetized

[2022-12-20 17:17:46] <%+bblackfire1> @brenner1265 Bought my house back in 2014 and I think the closing people even walked me thru how to do all that mumbo jumbo.  Pretty easy from what I recall.
[2022-12-20 17:17:53] <prozacco> @PureSpider very true, but here at least i understand the contracts to buy proprty (live in EE)
[2022-12-20 17:17:57] <macdrai> if you dont have income it's useless

[2022-12-20 17:18:12] <+iHeartBlueSkies> As a financial advisor I agree :)
[2022-12-20 17:18:18] <PureSpider> ALWAYS bring in your own inspectors

[2022-12-20 17:18:28] <JimmyXQ> all planned. All this convolution will increase GDP Kappa
[2022-12-20 17:18:34] <+stormblaz> is a more expensive inspector better returns?

[2022-12-20 17:39:07] <RetreatingHairline> Would magma work and like blocking and releasing the flow?
[2022-12-20 17:39:10] <+ThePixelbrain> Pyrotheum works as well and is free
[2022-12-20 17:39:14] <%+DecoyOcelot> its later though
[2022-12-20 17:39:14] <daen0144isback> i think you can use fire water too idk if its in this modpack
[2022-12-20 17:39:17] <n00rman_> bucket of pyrotheum
[2022-12-20 17:39:17] <XxPyrooxX> does it also burn in fires tho?
[2022-12-20 17:39:17] <+ThePixelbrain> Or Fire Water yes
[2022-12-20 17:39:18] <nitroussss17> You can do it with firewater too
[2022-12-20 17:39:27] <stormzwest> you can just place a bucket of pyrotheum, it will ignite nearby blocks, then just collect them

[2022-12-20 17:40:42] <%DX_Plates> @akaCube Maybe if you only needed a couple, but I think this pack uses a TON of them, many packs use them as a base component for chips.

[2022-12-20 18:14:26] <%+DecoyOcelot> i think a redstone confuit connected to snad is the fastest

[2022-12-20 18:14:53] <+trottwood> I always use redstone conduit set with strong signal and it keeps up

[2022-12-20 18:42:15] <+T3h133t3tah> when i have that problem i tend to just bandaid it with conduit on every open side of the cane drawer so that each side pulls lmao
[2022-12-20 18:42:22] <Marcusdev94> void upgrade for the drawer most likely
[2022-12-20 18:42:28] <Skylance117> that what you calla stack overflow hehe
[2022-12-20 18:42:40] <Larskeizer> @Larskeizer After about 8 hours the burn was gone and a day later I had zero problems. But there's different types of eye laser surgery, some very quick recovery, others slower
[2022-12-20 18:42:48] <MetraUnicorn> is the drawer voided ?
[2022-12-20 18:42:51] <n00rman_> enderio painting machine is good for lighting
[2022-12-20 18:43:13] <Brakston> its not the lights from the flare that makes lag its the flare checking the area for no light source

[2022-12-20 19:12:57] <Kaylome97> i liked the sevtech ages veins, all clustered together
[2022-12-20 19:13:06] <calebhub514> I find it very satisfying to completely mine out the gregtech ore veins, just a giant square hole in the world.

[2022-12-20 19:16:36] <+jdog0616> if the card is used in your buisness you could write it off

[2022-12-20 19:16:40] <leroycs803> Friend bought a car to be under the amount of savings that would be taxable

[2022-12-20 19:17:52] <+iHeartBlueSkies> Bonuses are definitely taxable to the employee

[2022-12-20 19:17:52] <+ReedS77> A bonus is not a gift lol
[2022-12-20 19:17:54] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle only way it wouldnt be taxed is if it remained company property
[2022-12-20 19:17:55] <+CommanderUrsus> it just fell out of the computer, rigth into my hands
[2022-12-20 19:17:56] <goldenknight22> unless its cash Kappa
[2022-12-20 19:17:56] <Stormflare> they are taxed as income
[2022-12-20 19:17:57] <+ai3dunks> they are taxed and at a higher rate
[2022-12-20 19:17:59] <+iHeartBlueSkies> The employer gets a payroll deduction

[2022-12-20 19:18:10] <+jdog0616> any money recieved is income and taxed as such, with the exceptions of gambling winning (here in Ontario)
[2022-12-20 19:18:12] <%GeekJenn> What's a bonus LUL
[2022-12-20 19:18:17] <+thebubbajones1> Cash tips however are supposed to be taxed but mostly aren’t as they’re self reported
[2022-12-20 19:18:19] <satyasann> in my country there's a limit on what can't be taxed and if you exceed that it depends on how much was the excess over the limit
[2022-12-20 19:18:20] <+JacobSolo> Taxed at a higher rate too

[2022-12-20 19:18:41] <+iHeartBlueSkies> @JacobSolo Withheld on at a higher rate; the tax rate is still the same as your other income
[2022-12-20 19:18:53] <+Sentinel1_9> waffle stream gives you bonuses all year long you just choose to call them "tips" Kappa
[2022-12-20 19:18:53] <Lupic> people working in accounts be like "boss, excel requires a more powerful gpu, can we expense a few 4090s?"

[2022-12-20 19:19:28] <+ReedS77> @jezusnuts Cash is still taxxed lol. Its just it doesn't come right out of your pay. Its your responsibility to report your cash earnings and pay tax on them
[2022-12-20 19:19:31] <jayrickson87> you'll need at least 6-8 different assembly machines with programed circuita

[2022-12-20 19:19:53] <+thebubbajones1> @reeds77 can confirm pizza drivers are not reporting that number accurately
[2022-12-20 19:20:16] <mn_sisu> We have profit sharing. this year I will get 12.5% of my gross wages in a bonus. then it is taxed 60%... it kills me every time seeing how much goes to the government. @Giantwaffle

[2022-12-20 21:32:41] <+xDeadBringerx> @Giantwaffle Gallium doping is getting more common for solar panel production. Boron undergoes boron-oxygen complexes under sunlight causing light induced degradation.
[2022-12-20 21:32:43] <+okuumu> gallium apparently can be used in doping pvs for better cell lifetimes

[2022-12-20 21:38:57] <+jo_beorn> so next century? until we find more.

[2022-12-20 21:39:38] <+LegacyOfPain> i've never played factorio. is it GOAT?
[2022-12-20 21:39:49] <%InTheLittlePro> Isnt factorio an old ass game? what could they add with dlc that not already modded
[2022-12-20 21:40:02] <AlfaAnanas> is God of War your first?
[2022-12-20 21:40:07] <Kerold> FeelsWeirdMan

[2022-12-20 21:40:11] <@%$Apparentthreat> AlfaAnanas how'd you know?
[2022-12-20 21:40:12] <%+LiveType> @jo_beorn Eh, it's not so much the raw amount. It's the amount that's economically viable to extract. This is where new technologies come into play. Fracking was the new game changer of the past decade. Then you need to find a new technology

[2022-12-20 21:43:21] <+Shank_nasty> Oil doesn’t make up much of electricity generation. Natural gas is about 60%.

[2022-12-20 21:43:53] <%+LiveType> @Nexhunter Facts
[2022-12-20 21:43:54] <Kisheen> Petrochem/coal does actually emit a lot of radiation from their byproducts
[2022-12-20 21:43:55] <+CommanderUrsus> still gotta dig it out of the ground
[2022-12-20 21:43:55] <Stormflare> the problem with wind and solar as well is they cannot react quickly to changing demand on the grid. you can easily burn more fossil fuel and generate more power in a couple minutes if load is high. can't with solar/wind with current storage tech
[2022-12-20 21:43:57] <Best_of_Strategie> @Pilgrim_age  i dont say what is right but its an option
[2022-12-20 21:43:57] <@%+Nexhunter> oh no radiation is a byproduct of oil burning KEKW
