[2022-12-17 17:27:35] <borki6a> well if you studied microprocessors they do multitasking and they don't do 2 process simultaniously but they do it swithing between 2 or more
[2022-12-17 17:27:42] <JRScribe> science is uncovering some evidence that quantum behavior is involved in task switching which makes it potentially very fast indeed
