[2022-12-18 02:54:31] <+mysticrio2605> it's funny because when i play football i am very confident and play with confidence because i know it's good to play like you're better than you are, but on overwatch i play really unconfident

[2022-12-18 02:55:25] <@%ratprime66> When I play tank sometimes I stop thinking and just, smack
[2022-12-18 02:56:03] <+mysticrio2605> you see but my issue with tank is that i've never been a leader or anything like that. i play reactively solely, and i play a very technical game in all games usually based on what's going on around me
[2022-12-18 02:56:07] <%dankpips45> Play overwatch with the confidence of a diamond, but the ego of a bronze.
[2022-12-18 02:56:08] <+mysticrio2605> i never really initiate anything
[2022-12-18 02:56:39] <%CharlottePosting> I dont know how good of a comparison this is but isnt football a game of inches/spacing?  OW in some compositions i feel like rivals it

[2022-12-18 02:57:27] <+mysticrio2605> @CharlottePosting depends on the position really. if you're a defender 90% of the match is all about positioning and spacing etc. but i play as a btb midfielder and my whole game is about running up and down the pitch, making spaces and carrying the ball forward
[2022-12-18 02:57:54] <+mysticrio2605> my positioning matters but if i'm having a good game the other team should worry about spacing around me and i shouldn't be worrying about spacing others if that makes sense?

[2022-12-18 19:09:13] <%FATALHERMIT> we base our understanding of others' accents on the difference between our accent and theirs, that's why it's soo hard to understand our own accent
