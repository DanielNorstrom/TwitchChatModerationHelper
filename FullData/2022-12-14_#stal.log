[2022-12-14 10:46:55] <%Brruhv> Sometimes we make mistakes and it gets us stressed out and its fine.  Trying to make things right and improve is what we are striving for. Humans arent perfect but that doesnt mean we could try to perfect ourselves. At the end of the day ,those who are great are those who try and make things right even if it means failing again. Cheer up Stal.
