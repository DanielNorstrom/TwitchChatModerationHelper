[2023-01-08 00:49:55] <%$nemafow> I hope you can nail down the troubleshooting with little effort ezeggNaruto
[2023-01-08 00:57:28] <~%OverEzEggs> now i just fight brain worms about playing tarky
[2023-01-08 00:58:26] <%$nemafow> Honestly, dont play it if you dont want to
[2023-01-08 00:58:52] <~%OverEzEggs> it aint that i dont wanna play i just feel weird about playing anything rn
[2023-01-08 00:59:17] <%$nemafow> Well your art HAS been super good
[2023-01-08 00:59:29] <%$nemafow> So dont feel pressured
[2023-01-08 00:59:52] <%$nemafow> We all just wanna hang out with you, whatever you decide to do
[2023-01-08 01:00:40] <~%OverEzEggs> like i love streaming , but games are weird, ever  since i stopped play valorant and didddnt have that as a fall back game i just feel like ive been stuggling to figure out what i wanna stream , ive downloaded a fuck ton of games tho and wanna play random shit , but when the time comes i just - dont
[2023-01-08 01:01:05] <~%OverEzEggs> yeee and im so thankful for that , i just need to find my confidence
[2023-01-08 01:01:15] <%$nemafow> Thats a hard one
[2023-01-08 01:01:23] <%$nemafow> Have you tried playing something off stream?
[2023-01-08 01:01:58] <~%OverEzEggs> nah LMAO i havent played a game off stream baring random tarky runs in 2 years
[2023-01-08 01:02:11] <%$nemafow> I can imagine it might be a bit stressful to be able to 'perform' in a game to an audience
[2023-01-08 01:03:07] <%$nemafow> Perhaps you need to find a chill game that you can play cooperatively with Shark off stream, loosen up a little
[2023-01-08 01:03:24] <~%OverEzEggs> yeaahh prolly
[2023-01-08 01:03:45] <%$nemafow> But you are innately competitive

[2023-01-08 03:07:33] <!%$operatorviera> I think i have spent the most time in the customs map
[2023-01-08 03:07:46] <applecratem> customs was my starting map as well
[2023-01-08 03:08:07] <!%$operatorviera> and the least in labs and factory
[2023-01-08 03:08:10] <+jcd96> customs is where most of the starting tasks are
[2023-01-08 03:08:30] <+jcd96> so its kinda mandatory if you wanna quest
[2023-01-08 03:08:33] <applecratem> i generally go with factory for scav kill tasks, why? because i hate myself i guess
[2023-01-08 03:08:50] <%$nemafow> Customs is easiest map to find PVP, its why alot of people enjoy it
[2023-01-08 03:08:55] <!%$operatorviera> I think everyone has their main maps they go to when they just wanna play

[2023-01-08 04:01:36] <@%$willrob87> yeah they own the intellectual property  on it
[2023-01-08 04:01:40] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> I doubt they can, but they made those rules now so best not to touch it for now
[2023-01-08 04:01:44] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> yeah exactly they cant do that shit at all
[2023-01-08 04:01:45] <%$AbbyssalChimera> Streaming should still be kosher, since you never needed permission before
[2023-01-08 04:01:49] <%$nemafow> If they can win in court they can do whatever they want
[2023-01-08 04:01:50] <@%$SharkBiteREM> wait what?
[2023-01-08 04:01:50] <!%$operatorviera> I wonder what that means for Critical Role
[2023-01-08 04:01:56] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> tldr WotC released a new OGL it's....VERY messy grey area

[2023-01-08 04:02:14] <@%$SharkBiteREM> they straight out cant enforce that

[2023-01-08 04:02:34] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> those dnd nerds will just make a new game if they really try to do that shit
[2023-01-08 04:02:34] <%SchnozBott> Uh no they can't do that, I know some copryright law
[2023-01-08 04:02:37] <%$AbbyssalChimera> Written stuff will be draconian, but streams should be safe
[2023-01-08 04:02:38] <@%$SharkBiteREM> people barely play official dnd as is
[2023-01-08 04:02:44] <@%$SharkBiteREM> they just wont play it

[2023-01-08 04:03:01] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> I REALLY doubt they can get away with it, just not touching it is prob best to not touch it for now, at least till we see if they enforce it, and if they do, if it plays out in court if they win, somehow
[2023-01-08 04:03:01] <applecratem> like what
[2023-01-08 04:03:02] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> They can't enforce it, but they WILL go the nintendo route and bully and sue out the ass
[2023-01-08 04:03:06] <%$AbbyssalChimera> It just becomes a good reason to hop over to Pathfinder KEKW

[2023-01-08 04:03:27] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> WotC has been an awful shitshow both with D&D AND MTG
[2023-01-08 04:03:28] <@%$willrob87> heys jacc
[2023-01-08 04:03:31] <%SchnozBott> They can copyright the books themselves, and licensed media based on it, but that's it
[2023-01-08 04:03:33] <%Jaccquee> what company is being fucked up
[2023-01-08 04:03:33] <%JBookwyrm> At least  the DND half of WOTC is becoming as community friendly as MTG
[2023-01-08 04:03:34] <@%$SharkBiteREM> They already have critical role contracted
[2023-01-08 04:03:42] <@%$willrob87> ^^
[2023-01-08 04:03:44] <%$AbbyssalChimera> CR is also the BIGGEST reason 5e is so popular too
[2023-01-08 04:03:46] <@%$SharkBiteREM> they're like brand ambasadors
[2023-01-08 04:03:50] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> the dnd super fans will just create a new dnd thing like pathfinder then if they do try i bet
[2023-01-08 04:03:56] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> they're going to bully the smaller creators essentially
[2023-01-08 04:03:57] <%Stormeflame> has been for a while
[2023-01-08 04:04:06] <applecratem> i think Crit Role is objectively THE largest dnd thing out there
[2023-01-08 04:04:08] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> they've seen the money in it and want in
[2023-01-08 04:04:09] <%$nemafow> I mean, thats how Pathfinder started
[2023-01-08 04:04:09] <@%$SharkBiteREM> what, all 5 of them lmao
[2023-01-08 04:04:10] <%Jaccquee> F
[2023-01-08 04:04:11] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> they had a contract with dnd beyond which is owned by wizards of the coast so possibly?
[2023-01-08 04:04:21] <%+Elucet> Pathfinder is superior anyways, but damn
[2023-01-08 04:04:21] <Merc_20> True. No players no income
[2023-01-08 04:04:22] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> realistically what they should've done is "if you make more than 1 mil" type of shit or something idk, something less dumb
[2023-01-08 04:04:22] <%SchnozBott> This isn't that off brand for WOTC though, they do love to ruin things
[2023-01-08 04:04:27] <%Jaccquee> okee, back to painting
[2023-01-08 04:04:44] <%$AbbyssalChimera> That's all the sense
[2023-01-08 04:04:44] <@%$SharkBiteREM> like they can try
[2023-01-08 04:04:52] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> yeah those comps will prob get hit hard
[2023-01-08 04:05:05] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> I can link the most reputable post I've seen about it, I BET you they're going after creators too, they've been scummy for awhile
[2023-01-08 04:05:06] <%SchnozBott> They can't technically do that either, such works are essentially commentary
[2023-01-08 04:05:09] <%$fwpx> hey egg
[2023-01-08 04:05:11] <@%$SharkBiteREM> ok so they all remove "D&D" from their miniatures labels lmao
[2023-01-08 04:05:13] <!%$operatorviera> if we could seperate wotc from dnd that would be nice

[2023-01-08 04:05:35] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> thats still transformative from the comps cause they make like models, dice, map items and auch which isnt exclusively dnd too
[2023-01-08 04:05:47] <@%$SharkBiteREM> Literally just dont acknowledge WOTC KEKW
[2023-01-08 04:05:59] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> they can just call it "board game miniatures" or so and they can do nothing about it
[2023-01-08 04:06:00] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> Is DND even like, trademarked or anything like that?
[2023-01-08 04:06:02] <%SteazHornsby> Warhammer already did something like this before and still upholds it
[2023-01-08 04:06:06] <!%$operatorviera> No warhammer did something similar with fan films Egg
[2023-01-08 04:06:06] <@%$SharkBiteREM> rent the books at your library, scan them onto your PC
[2023-01-08 04:06:08] <@%$SharkBiteREM> ez done
[2023-01-08 04:06:31] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> dnd is trademarked by wotc technically i think
[2023-01-08 04:06:31] <%+Elucet> These guys are about to bring back a very angry Gary Gygax
[2023-01-08 04:06:34] <%SchnozBott> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[2023-01-08 04:06:39] <%Stormeflame> no but warhammer and fat shark are in hot water cause darktide console release has been delayed till tba and was supposed to release along pc on nov 31st and the only place they said that wasnt gonna happen was a couple days before launch on their reddit
[2023-01-08 04:06:39] <!%$operatorviera> cos they wanted to release their own films and wanted all fan content out of the way
[2023-01-08 04:06:48] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> the guys who created dnd made wotc right?
[2023-01-08 04:06:49] <%$AbbyssalChimera> @sharkbiterem literally what happened with 4e XD
[2023-01-08 04:06:55] <%$AbbyssalChimera> Nope
[2023-01-08 04:07:14] <%SchnozBott> WOTC's initial claim to fame was MTG

[2023-01-08 04:07:22] BITS: Touchthesky8 (100)
[2023-01-08 04:07:22] <!%Touchthesky8> The people who did Warhammer did that once with the warhammer streaming service. They went after some of the people making warhammer fan content on youtube. A massive number of youtube content creators never  forgave them for it and refuse to interact with Warhammer because of the dumb shit done by the company who owns warhammer.  They can easily end up creating some serious damage to the entire brand if they do that shit cheer100
[2023-01-08 04:07:39] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> yeah so i dont think theyll go after critical role cause they sponsor them through dnd beyond
[2023-01-08 04:07:41] <@%$willrob87> @aj_hyper_bit yes dnd is trademarked
[2023-01-08 04:07:53] <Merc_20> Why can’t they just make the game and let us play and have fun. Stop trying to control and make crazy profits
[2023-01-08 04:08:26] <!%$operatorviera> cos company Merc_20

[2023-01-08 04:08:41] <%Stormeflame> Cyberpunk dnd would be a dnd module and they would own it lol
[2023-01-08 04:08:43] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> My concern is that WotC has historically NOT GIVEN A SHIT about catching shit for things like this
[2023-01-08 04:08:49] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> pathfinders pretty popular already too
[2023-01-08 04:09:03] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> They pull scummy shit all the time in MTG

[2023-01-08 04:09:44] <@%$willrob87> the problem is Wizards of the coast claims they own the play structure style
[2023-01-08 04:09:51] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> speaking of alternatice dnd have u guys seen yhe avatar dnd game?
[2023-01-08 04:09:54] <%SchnozBott> @Touchthesky8 I see this as an absolute win, there have been way better TTRPGs since then

[2023-01-08 06:29:52] <%arandomfox> It’s a movie that is just thinly veiled enough for people to go “no, that’s not a social commentary.”
[2023-01-08 06:29:59] <monkeyooh> Starship troopers is also good
[2023-01-08 06:30:06] <!%$operatorviera> Yeah i get that Dark, i've not played last season and i've only just started to play again this season

[2023-01-08 06:30:42] <monkeyooh> 1 was enough
[2023-01-08 06:30:43] <@%$willrob87> 4 movies 2 Tv series i think
[2023-01-08 06:30:44] <%$nemafow> A tv series
[2023-01-08 06:30:51] <!%CoopKaiju> The CG one was pretty good for Starship Trooper
[2023-01-08 06:30:54] <%arandomfox> It was a book before all that.
[2023-01-08 06:31:02] <%$nemafow> But they different takes on the same book series

[2023-01-08 06:31:19] <%haiddon> the first movie apparently takes place only like 4 or 5 chapters through the book. like really early on
[2023-01-08 06:31:20] <%arandomfox> Where all the fascy overtones were satire to the extreme.
[2023-01-08 06:31:33] <!%$operatorviera> The OG is more of a parody of the book
[2023-01-08 06:31:37] <%$nemafow> The movies are ultra violent, the series is not
