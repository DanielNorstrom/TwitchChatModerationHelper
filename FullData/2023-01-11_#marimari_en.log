[2023-01-11 08:11:49] <+InfiniteZr0> Chicken pox isn't really an issue when you're younger. But apparently the older you get, the more dangerous it is.

[2023-01-11 08:12:13] <%squigily555> It's probably better to have ChickenPox as a kid than get Shingles later
[2023-01-11 08:12:17] <%n3rozer8> ive never had chickenpox

[2023-01-11 08:12:21] <%hunter_hues> we should just take all the kids and put them in a room and the ones who live thru the sickness get to come out
[2023-01-11 08:12:21] <+Erymry> Chicken pox isn't real it's just your soul trying to escape your body
[2023-01-11 08:12:23] <@%HinaBoBina> Hot shingles in your area

[2023-01-11 08:12:32] <%DaveSPV> shingles sounds like an instrument
[2023-01-11 08:12:35] <%wrythen1> bigpox hates it when children doesnt get pox
[2023-01-11 08:12:40] <+InfiniteZr0> Will the shingles protect me from the rain?

[2023-01-11 08:12:56] <%n3rozer8> its is
[2023-01-11 08:12:56] <muzzupz> I have that
[2023-01-11 08:13:03] <+nachtigalfinn> Yeah, shingles inflames the nerves and can even cause lasting bruise-like appearance on skin, except way more painful
[2023-01-11 08:13:11] <%hunter_hues> like firepunch hinaboInsane
[2023-01-11 08:13:12] <%$btsdm> man butt

[2023-01-11 08:13:18] <eggbreadz> Oh, apparently Shingles is reactivated Chickenpox.
[2023-01-11 08:13:19] <Ta11ow> because the chicken pox virus is dormant in your spinal cord, when it flares up as shingles it lights up the nerves it's living in
[2023-01-11 08:13:23] <+InfiniteZr0> Toothache is up there. A 24/7 constant dull ache that you can't do anything about until you go to a dentist
[2023-01-11 08:13:27] <mojipittan> naa, just extra-sensitive skin ... makes you wanna scratch until your skin bleeds

[2023-01-11 08:13:49] <fluffybodypillow55> In simple terms pain vs nerve pain is having a hole on the yard versus on the road.
[2023-01-11 08:13:53] <%+thekushkraken> shingles make your nerves feel like on fire
[2023-01-11 08:13:56] <UsagiiHop> sex
[2023-01-11 08:14:02] <muzzupz> it's a disorder of the nervous system or brain
[2023-01-11 08:14:16] <Ta11ow> pain is stimulus processed by nerves, nerve pain is just the nerves telling you to go fuck yourself
[2023-01-11 08:14:17] <$Jackal279> look pain is temporary but nerve pain, the nerves themselves are damaged so you'll feel pain forever

[2023-01-11 08:14:30] <mojipittan> sometimes ... I pull on it so hard, it breaks the skin ^^
[2023-01-11 08:14:33] <50shadesofbill> its like constant deep burn

[2023-01-11 08:14:48] <+nachtigalfinn> Nerve pain is like having really hot wires constantly burning throughout your body.
[2023-01-11 08:14:50] <cwakel> I had arthritis bad the last 3 years then it went away from 15 year old broken thumb
[2023-01-11 08:14:50] <%squigily555> Normal pain is when you have some damage

[2023-01-11 08:15:58] <Beef_> it is real pain because pain is there for your body to tell you to not do that

[2023-01-11 08:16:09] <%BLZbubs> i simply choose to not feel pain

[2023-01-11 08:16:24] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> gatekeep pain
[2023-01-11 08:16:26] <%agpen> nerve pain is existential, it reminds you that nothing you experience is untainted by the biology that creates it
[2023-01-11 08:16:31] <eggbreadz> Nerve pain is the worst.
[2023-01-11 08:16:31] <pig_d12> just turn 360 and walk away bro
[2023-01-11 08:16:37] <%+Wasdniak> placebos are real
[2023-01-11 08:16:38] <!%garfield1187> nerve pain is when your nerves sense pain thast shouldnt be there right?
[2023-01-11 08:16:40] <$UrdFire> if you ever got nerve pain yourself, you'll immediately be able to tell the difference, its not the same as normal pain
[2023-01-11 08:16:43] <%hunter_hues> mari are u real

[2023-01-11 08:17:13] <jIirt> so related, phantom pain is an actual term to describe pain amputees go through where they feel pain from limbs which aren't there
[2023-01-11 08:17:13] <!%garfield1187> pain is your body's built in gains goblin

[2023-01-11 09:43:33] <RagePlai> Hail the Admiral!
[2023-01-11 09:43:33] <FrostiOwl> meth is safe
[2023-01-11 09:43:39] <!%garfield1187> alc is much worse for you than lots of "hard drugs"
[2023-01-11 09:43:41] <Frank_Dreadnought> alcohol is pretty hard though
[2023-01-11 09:43:43] <%hunter_hues> ur right mari ill do meth at my family gatherings
[2023-01-11 09:43:47] <%BLZbubs> quitting drinking was the hardest thing i've ever done but it was 100% worth it
[2023-01-11 09:43:48] <!%$RJ2theLA2> ENERGY DRINKS
[2023-01-11 09:43:49] <darkrebellion34> it's bullshit
[2023-01-11 09:43:59] <!%Maethra> there are risks to everything
[2023-01-11 09:43:59] <%+Wasdniak> even caffeine
[2023-01-11 09:44:00] <+sloomy> alcohol is much worse than many many drugs, it is a drug
[2023-01-11 09:44:00] <!%garfield1187> any substance has risks
[2023-01-11 09:44:04] <%faolan123> @sun312772 hi cutie
[2023-01-11 09:44:05] <urushi> its still foreign substance in ur body yeah
[2023-01-11 09:44:06] <%+paintchip> @garfield1187 In general, addictive dispositions are believed to have a genetic component
[2023-01-11 09:44:09] <%Gashapon> it still can affect your lungs
[2023-01-11 09:44:12] <kaosmomo> alcohol is not that far from hard drugs
[2023-01-11 09:44:13] <%theredhunterr> can't say I understand with alcohol, but I 100% feel that way with cigarettes, second hand smokes smells so good I'm afraid to ever try it directly
[2023-01-11 09:44:14] <%saber_tank> stop breathing, oxygen also get you high
[2023-01-11 09:44:14] <%$basic_edition> even video games
[2023-01-11 09:44:16] <!%Maethra> thc is very safe in general but even it has risks
[2023-01-11 09:44:21] <The7thSage> @garfield1187 prob both, actions of your grandparents do affect your genes in bizarre hard to understand ways
[2023-01-11 09:44:23] <eggbreadz> What about cum
[2023-01-11 09:44:29] <silvernugg> its a cure to sadness, or boredom
[2023-01-11 09:44:30] VIEWERS: 574
[2023-01-11 09:44:34] <%$btsdm> alcohol is definitely a hard drug tho
[2023-01-11 09:44:37] <%CrumblyBits> The risk is being addicted, once u get tru with that is when u have fun
[2023-01-11 09:44:40] <freedimension> it's all about whether you're in for a good time or a long time
[2023-01-11 09:44:42] <AloofCentipede> too much water can kill you
[2023-01-11 09:44:43] <+sloomy> @theredhunterr wtf second hand smoke smells like a trash can farted
[2023-01-11 09:44:44] <+HazardPrime> My Niece friends do that shit and they are addicted as fuck

[2023-01-11 09:45:19] <+sloomy> never vape kids
[2023-01-11 09:45:21] <!%Maethra> but it was comforting before
[2023-01-11 09:45:26] <%saber_tank> i did not grow up with a smoker, but i do find it comforting depending on brand
[2023-01-11 09:45:27] <urushi> same @Maethra
[2023-01-11 09:45:28] <eggbreadz> Getting in a car with a smoker is terrible
[2023-01-11 09:45:28] <silvernugg> the smell is bad but the comforting is being around others who are stressed and dont want you to be
[2023-01-11 09:45:30] <%$btsdm> quitting is easy, i've done it hundreds of times
[2023-01-11 09:45:30] <%DaveSPV> it was badass back then
[2023-01-11 09:45:31] <jIirt> I didn't grow up around smokers, it smells nostalgic but I hate it
[2023-01-11 09:45:35] <%faolan123> docs said it was healthy
[2023-01-11 09:45:39] <%$btsdm> smoking still makes u look hella badass you gotta admit
[2023-01-11 09:45:43] <%mylon_138> i did grow up with smokers but i still find the smell annoying
[2023-01-11 09:45:47] <%luckeycat> used to be comforting but now its enraging thb
[2023-01-11 09:45:50] <catboyjoker> it's making a comeback, vaping is out and smoking is in
[2023-01-11 09:45:53] <MalignantUpper> yeah
[2023-01-11 09:45:59] <urushi> my logic when i was a kid was if im gonna be outside i wanna look cool and smoke, such a dumb fuck
[2023-01-11 09:46:01] <The7thSage> I grew up around smokers but I always rember dying around smoke
[2023-01-11 09:46:02] <FrostiOwl> that reminds me of smoking in resturants

[2023-01-11 09:46:24] <Frank_Dreadnought> many of my family members smoked and I started to smoke too with 16 but a was able to quit 12 years later
[2023-01-11 09:46:27] <KaBoooooooooooooooM> bruh the idea of me spending money on cigarettes instead of figurines is not my style

[2023-01-11 09:51:11] <silvernugg> dont clip that
[2023-01-11 09:51:14] <@%HinaBoBina> PURE METH is fine but the impurities make it bad for you
[2023-01-11 09:51:19] <%riskofjay> I take an amphetamine for ADHD
[2023-01-11 09:51:20] <Adamisfruit> Meth is an excellent combat drug

[2023-01-11 09:51:33] <%BLZbubs> you can get prescribed actual meth for adhd
[2023-01-11 09:51:36] <!%delightfully_smol> ritalin is not an amphetiamine
[2023-01-11 09:51:38] <%faolan123> your skin dies and scabs up in scale like patterns giving the look of crocodile skin hence the name
[2023-01-11 09:51:47] <%+Wasdniak> Hina on the blue stuff
[2023-01-11 09:51:47] <!%delightfully_smol> there are only three prescribable amphetiamines

[2023-01-11 09:51:50] <TheWeebest> adderal is meth
[2023-01-11 09:51:52] <!%delightfully_smol> no
[2023-01-11 09:51:53] <%$btsdm> not really

[2023-01-11 09:51:58] <!%Maethra> they're similar
[2023-01-11 09:51:58] <%luckeycat> I hated having to take ritalin
[2023-01-11 09:51:58] <@%HinaBoBina> he smol
[2023-01-11 09:51:58] <%BLZbubs> they're not the same thing, but they are similar
[2023-01-11 09:52:02] <@%HinaBoBina> hi* smol
[2023-01-11 09:52:04] <TheWeebest> its one chemical compound away from meth
[2023-01-11 09:52:04] <%$btsdm> ritalin is like cocaine that lasts a long time and adderall is like diet meth
[2023-01-11 09:52:06] <!%delightfully_smol> they function the same but they are different substances
[2023-01-11 09:52:10] <urushi> isnt adderall the drug video game pros use to do better in tournaments
[2023-01-11 09:52:11] <%riskofjay> prescribed Adderall is why I'm able to get through school
[2023-01-11 09:52:15] <!%Maethra> both make me better at life
[2023-01-11 09:52:20] <%BLZbubs> ritalin is more similar to cocaine kinda sorta
[2023-01-11 09:52:23] <+MetalTeuffel> i mean the kind of meth people cook, not the prescription kind
[2023-01-11 09:52:25] <!%delightfully_smol> adderall, vyvanse and dexadrin are the three prescribable amphetamines
[2023-01-11 09:52:27] <TheWeebest> RIP the adderall shortage
