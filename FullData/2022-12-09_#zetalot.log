[2022-12-09 14:02:13] <%+Lurkio79> @tidolar i think the prob with OTKs now is that they seem to be able to activate them so early. turn 7 and less feels unfair. OTKs should be built up over a longer game imo

[2022-12-09 14:50:27] <%$tidolar> @tidolar this sounds like a standard balancing complaint, though, not "OTKs are bad". i think they should definitely enable aggro decks a bit more to keep combo more in check, but we're 3 days into the xpac. it's hard to take any complaints too seriously right now because there's not enough evidence for anything
[2022-12-09 14:51:34] <%+Lurkio79> @tidolar i agree too early. some decks just*feel* mega unfair though, and that is important as the playing experience is everything
[2022-12-09 14:51:46] <SnorkyARC> @tictac_hs You can imagine that its a always a Denathrius COPIUM
[2022-12-09 14:52:16] <%+Lurkio79> losing to hunter OTK on turn 7 when no decisions you make have any effect feels like shit. that cant be good for anyone
[2022-12-09 14:52:20] <%$tidolar> a couple of decks always end up feeling gigabroken in the first few days of an expansion, then the meta almost always settles

[2022-12-09 15:32:29] <JakaCCC> !wincon
[2022-12-09 15:32:29] <^StreamElements> And if you're looking for a "win condition" by looking for cards that say "Win the game.", I think that's setting yourself up for disappointment. Rather, there's several ways that Priest can win games; high value control, healing synergies, big minions, Rally stuff, etc.
[2022-12-09 15:32:34] <Hachiibee> does it transform minnions after the whirlpool effect ?
