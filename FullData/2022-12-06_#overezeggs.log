[2022-12-06 01:52:52] <%patpeez> he'll probably get buffs aftre a couple weeks
[2022-12-06 01:53:02] <%deputyimasian> @patpeez thats what im thinking
[2022-12-06 01:53:04] <%TTourist> His shield cd looks like ass, he doesn’t have anything to not die
[2022-12-06 01:53:14] <%deputyimasian> either mid season or after season 2
[2022-12-06 01:53:36] <%deputyimasian> for quickplay ill play him, but in comp? not too fantastic
[2022-12-06 01:53:39] <%chrisplaces> So we'll still see a lot of Roadhog and Winton and Ram will be played by few
[2022-12-06 01:53:42] <%RatboyJon> he won't be anyone's main after the honeymoon release
[2022-12-06 01:53:46] <%Pythia_Archana> yeah he is still gonna be fun to use im sure. but higher play he may not be seen as much later on
[2022-12-06 01:54:10] VIEWERS: 276
[2022-12-06 01:54:37] <%chrisplaces> I don't think it'll be used in comp at all
[2022-12-06 01:55:00] <%patpeez> I think the penetrate could save Ram though, because when everyone is stacked on the cart in overtime I think that's going to mess a team up
[2022-12-06 01:55:01] <%chubsthewolff> also that 450 Health pool is really fucking low for a tank
[2022-12-06 01:55:19] <%deputyimasian> hes 100% a situational tank, barely even that, if his vortex doesnt get some form of a buff/ his melee isnt improved hes going to be horrible
[2022-12-06 01:55:23] <%chrisplaces> Yea just as bad as Doomfist
[2022-12-06 01:55:26] <%chubsthewolff> Like Hog has like 700 HP
[2022-12-06 01:55:36] <%Pythia_Archana> he gets armor in nemisis form right?
[2022-12-06 01:55:37] <%deputyimasian> also he has 0 armor as a tank with that little hp? thats fucking rough
[2022-12-06 01:55:42] <%chubsthewolff> Hes a nutered DPS
[2022-12-06 01:55:42] <%RatboyJon> 450 health with that crap cooldown on the shield too
[2022-12-06 01:55:54] <SchnozBott> They could buff him later, these starting stats seem rushed
[2022-12-06 01:55:55] <%chrisplaces> Yes Sigma is 650
[2022-12-06 01:56:06] <%TTourist> 450 with no armor or anything 💀
[2022-12-06 01:56:10] VIEWERS: 272
[2022-12-06 01:56:48] <%deputyimasian> yeah the fact that sigmas ult ceiling can catch a pharah more effieciently than rams vortex is rough
[2022-12-06 01:57:10] <@%AJ_Hyper_Bit> they prob planned it as a DPS and then realized they had nothing for tank or support so they were just like "quick, quick, make it a tank" KEKW
[2022-12-06 01:57:23] <%deputyimasian> he doesnt regen, it just lasts longer if he does damage with it
[2022-12-06 01:57:41] <%RatboyJon> @deputyimasian ouch
[2022-12-06 01:57:48] <%deputyimasian> you know what rammatra is? hes an off tank from overwatch 1 during 6v6 LOL

[2022-12-06 01:58:48] <%deputyimasian> LOL a 6v6 scenario, his util would be so good with the main tank, but in the 5v5 environment where tank has to be independant? hes not fantastic
