[2022-12-30 00:00:04] <@%+T1JoeMar> Max crushes it at 8am staff meetings
[2022-12-30 00:00:05] <%cope_maxi> I LOVE MAX WALDO
[2022-12-30 00:00:05] <%+GoldknightGG> I'm strongest as a top lane coach but he feels he got demoted? WHAT IS GOING ON? Lol
[2022-12-30 00:00:08] <kezio_1> I LOVE U MAX <3
[2022-12-30 00:00:11] <CripplingCranberry> LS I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.

Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.

[2022-12-30 00:13:21] <CripplingCranberry> So he is not going to stream, not going to coach and instead will be messing aroudn with girls in his bedroom. His resolve has gone down and he just wants to mess aroudn with OF girls in LA and go out to parties each week. He says NA is bad but it is beacuse of people like him who refuse to keep on going and keep on getting better, this is why the East will always be better and why coaches like Xiao Rui Lin in LDLC will find much more success.

[2022-12-30 00:13:54] <CripplingCranberry> @imls I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.

[2022-12-30 00:16:39] <thepoxyk> @imls Max said he wouldnt be efficient coach in KR bacause of the language barrier... IF truly given the opportunity would he be willing to sacrifice the time learning Korean to work with better players in some way ?
[2022-12-30 00:16:41] <Yummypower> BatChest JimmyHere really gonna go chekc him out!

[2022-12-30 00:16:42] <+Iris2c> JimmyHere
[2022-12-30 00:16:43] <CripplingCranberry> So he is not going to stream, not going to coach and instead will be messing aroudn with girls in his bedroom. His resolve has gone down and he just wants to mess aroudn with OF girls in LA and go out to parties each week. He says NA is bad but it is beacuse of people like him who refuse to keep on going and keep on getting better, this is why the East will always be better and why coaches like Xiao Rui Lin in LDLC will find much more success.  So LS, what is he going to do to make more money ?
[2022-12-30 00:16:45] <kezio_1> monkaHmm i see... .ÔΩ°oO ( SNIFFA )
[2022-12-30 00:16:47] <Yummypower> LS I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful

[2022-12-30 00:23:35] <+chunkymonkey42> sorry
[2022-12-30 00:23:36] <Th3mi5t28> @Th3mi5t28 fair
[2022-12-30 00:23:36] <+skioh3> The fact that it‚Äôs taking you so long to answer these questions makes me think that this was a rash decision and you‚Äôre 100% chasing the money which is not something that I‚Äôm shaming you for doing. But if you‚Äôre trying to lie about it by giving BS answers it‚Äôs cringe ngl.
[2022-12-30 00:23:37] <+chunkymonkey42> lol
[2022-12-30 00:23:42] <%Sparria_> why the lack of off meta drafting compared to ls's drafting?
[2022-12-30 00:23:44] <Youmotherflower> NA is doomed
[2022-12-30 00:23:45] <%+imBotched> is there a easy way to get coaches to open up for a wider view on the game? i feel like all drafts are based on what champs are ''strong'' and not answers to get an edge in the game.
[2022-12-30 00:23:49] <Alcappucino> SO MANY things :)
[2022-12-30 00:23:52] <%+Duel6> lets be honest coaches in pro teams are a joke
[2022-12-30 00:23:54] <%+onetakehoovie> @skioh3 or he's just thinking of saying the right things to say instead of blurting out the very first thought of word vomit lol

[2022-12-30 00:29:02] <CripplingCranberry> LS, please respond to the current crisis in the NA community, maybe its burnout - maybe its personal reasoning but Max should definitely explain why he is chasing the OF girls over the success of a potential top 4 worlds finish. Even Neace would not show this lack of resolve, Neace would try his hardest and cultivate NA talent and if you call him plat in KR you are just wrong because a coach doesnt play - he coaches. The neace hate is completely unjustified.

[2022-12-30 00:49:13] <CripplingCranberry> @imls I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.

[2022-12-30 01:09:05] <CripplingCranberry> LS I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.

Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.
