[2022-12-07 17:36:22] <%+Pato0ow> Maybe they can touch grass if you have a 46 hour ban KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:36:31] <LaCarreaSion> if DC, next match you run 5% slower

[2022-12-07 17:48:03] <shinybigscary> So foggy by default what?
[2022-12-07 17:48:05] <%+Pato0ow> @Scike_ Oh yeah the riding mon can glitch when you climb rocks and stuff like that and sometimes mons spawn under the ground (which cost me a shiny Sadge ) but everything is so good
[2022-12-07 17:48:36] <shinybigscary> I know, the fog is so dumb
[2022-12-07 17:48:37] <%+Pato0ow> They burn an offering to burn the map KEKW

[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%+Pato0ow> @Scike_ Yeah so I won't spoil, because it was an end game shiny, but a mon that was clipper underground attacked me, initiating a battle and then a shiny spawned, which despawned after the battle KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:49:51] <%+Pato0ow> clipped*

[2022-12-07 17:50:58] <+ravnav3000> i do it too
[2022-12-07 17:51:00] <%Pseudoskymnos> oh map offering? no mercy then hensBrows hensFine
[2022-12-07 17:51:06] <iiTzDarkLUL> i do it too
[2022-12-07 17:51:07] <%+Pato0ow> I even try harder when I get Eyrie random KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:51:07] <shinybigscary> I get a bit offended by maps
[2022-12-07 17:51:09] <%RandomTara> I do that with RPD
[2022-12-07 17:51:10] <%Chief_Ohnay> 100% I justify camping and tunneling if I see a map offering or syringe
[2022-12-07 17:51:11] <gurgelgrunz> I do too
[2022-12-07 17:51:11] <%ClussyHonks> Nah, if people send me to bad maps i always tryhard and show them
[2022-12-07 17:51:11] <%+Pato0ow> That map personally offend me KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:51:13] <+matteriess> in your opinion what's the worst map to be sent to?
[2022-12-07 17:51:13] <shinybigscary> offerings
[2022-12-07 17:51:17] <%+xploitr13> i do not give hatch or play nice at all on Map Offerings
[2022-12-07 17:51:17] <@%Ana1661> I don't ever tryhard 'cause I just don't care
[2022-12-07 17:51:17] <@%Steffano__> old haddonfield offering = 4man slug gaming otzComfy but i can't justify that anymore Sadge
[2022-12-07 17:51:19] <%+Scike_> when a map offering if brought I'll play harder- doesn't even matter which map, I just dislike the idea of map offerings
[2022-12-07 17:51:23] <inorwise> any offering tbh
[2022-12-07 17:51:29] <%+Pato0ow> @Ana1661 But you keep your stats monkaS
[2022-12-07 17:51:29] <LaCarreaSion> maybe in SWF they can manage with map offerings and coordinate well
[2022-12-07 17:51:30] <+stabstabs> It's the classic fuck around, find out. That's what a map offering does.
[2022-12-07 17:51:35] <%the_oracle_> had a weird moment the other day - both survivors and killer sent everyone to The Game KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:51:35] <%+ItsSamah> If I see a map offering I become a sweat lord
[2022-12-07 17:51:37] <%+gottlos_gaming> Def do the same thing if it is a known ez map (Game, RPD, Coldwind)
[2022-12-07 17:51:41] <iiTzDarkLUL> what about badham? @Hens333
[2022-12-07 17:51:50] <%the_oracle_> would you say dead dawg is a neutral offering?

[2022-12-07 17:52:09] <@%Ana1661> @Pato0ow I play strong build on strong killers. Also most of the time you don't need to tryhard to win in pubs
[2022-12-07 17:52:19] <%theringu> Badham is a joke
[2022-12-07 17:52:23] <%+xploitr13> If they send me to Dead Dawg, I think they are gonna try to bully at main building
[2022-12-07 17:52:24] <beereyy> people who bring preschool offerings give me bad vibes
[2022-12-07 17:52:24] <%cadxl> If i get sent to preschool i just face camp the first person i see and get 1-2K
[2022-12-07 17:52:31] <inorwise> i mean map offerings have a use tho so its more complicated than that
[2022-12-07 17:52:32] <@%Ana1661> @theringu Most of the time I'm here from start till finish hahaha
[2022-12-07 17:52:32] <+lumiinoous> literally just send me to any of the new maps im going to try my hardest to win
[2022-12-07 17:52:33] <%+Scike_> @grumblephant why do you have to? I don't use my shrouds and hatch/basement offerings either KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:52:33] <%Chief_Ohnay> if I play a game normally, no map offering, no medkits, and the survivors are getting rolled? I'll ease off the gas, engage in chases with the strongest survivors for some fun and practice, and avoid death hook survivors. Map offering or syringe? CAMP TUNNEL CAMP TUNNEL
[2022-12-07 17:52:35] <+RunaBlueRuna> with the new map i just realized u can nearly see from on site to the other

[2022-12-07 17:52:36] <%knifola> midwich hook spawns :)
[2022-12-07 17:52:38] <m101z> Saloon is fun though, just the genlock potential that's annoying
[2022-12-07 17:52:38] <%keitatakamurav3> Some people get unlucky with maps so they use map offerings to get something different
[2022-12-07 17:52:39] <atomicrow_> map offerings should be map blockers instead so u can guarantee one map to exclude

[2022-12-07 17:53:03] <inorwise> @atomicrow_ yeah this would be the best way to do it
[2022-12-07 17:53:05] <%+gottlos_gaming> Would like offerings that did the opposite instead. Reduce chance of going to Coldwind/RPD/etc..

[2022-12-07 17:55:00] <@%Ana1661> I would agree for map offerings to have like a 25% to have the map
[2022-12-07 17:55:19] <%Pseudoskymnos> maybe offerings are a way of BHVR admitting that they cant deal with the game balance as much
[2022-12-07 17:55:49] <@%Steffano__> i swear map offerings weren't 100% chance before

[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <%ClussyHonks> a while ago @sswagger21
[2022-12-07 18:14:48] <@%Ana1661> Nice phases
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <ObsidianLiger> yeah the feng
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <%GandorTheGreat> I love darkness revealed for lethal, because usually they give you same-ish start info, but darkness finds survivor also during game @Hens333
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <%Pseudoskymnos> ye leathal pretty much guarantees a down and tells where the rest is, so it might be weirdly time saving hensHmm

[2022-12-07 18:15:50] <%Chief_Ohnay> @ClussyHonks not that long ago. In 6.4.0, and maybe 6.4.1, it was still doing 2 seconds of aura reading after you hook someone when using Lethal (but not any base time from the hook like in the PTB)
[2022-12-07 18:16:03] <@%Loni1211> Ohh that one, nah the school one better NODDERS
