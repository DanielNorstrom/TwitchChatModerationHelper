[2022-12-27 06:31:07] <@%MiniKatalyst> I had a parent ask me last week for their kids friends names for a birthday in Jan.... most of his friends had already left for holidays and wouldnt get the invites. I felt teeeerrrible telling her that it is possibly too late to send out invites

[2022-12-27 06:42:35] <$Rararawr> I would actually die if I ever needed a needle anywhere other than my shoulder. I will fight back before someone draws my blood, I don't care whats wrong with me
[2022-12-27 06:42:46] <%Kardmager> Even as an adult I look away when I get blood drawn, idgaf

[2022-12-27 06:43:54] <$Rararawr> oh I was trying to fuck my brain up at the dentist. waiting around for the numbing stuff to kick in and I start looking at the tools and think "I don't want to know what sharp things are going in my mouth"
[2022-12-27 06:44:18] <@%MiniKatalyst> I've literally only just gotten on the computer after feeling nausious and praying I dont have gastro for the past 24hrs

[2022-12-27 06:45:13] <%Kardmager> I did have a case when a dentist assistant almost poke my eye with the cleaner tool because she wasn’t paying attention

[2022-12-27 06:45:32] <Boveip> the initial poke is alot but I think not numb enough is far worse

[2022-12-27 06:46:18] <$Rararawr> the thing that fucked me up at the dentist was I knew I was getting a tooth pulled, and was incredibly anxious before it, and then he did some cavities.
[2022-12-27 06:46:34] <$Rararawr> it was the 3rd time I got very anxious about it that it was the tooth pulling appointment
[2022-12-27 06:46:36] <%Kardmager> Rip beavers, should take care of them
[2022-12-27 06:46:42] <$Rararawr> and I was out of the building in under half an hour
[2022-12-27 06:47:06] <%Lakart> I think that depends on the tooth, sometimes that shit don't wanna leave.
[2022-12-27 06:47:19] <%+Lunar_Lucy> Wisdom teeth are the problematic ones

[2022-12-27 06:47:54] <%Lakart> The dentist had to fight my left one lmao
[2022-12-27 06:48:01] <+thunderdan11> when i got all 4 wisdom teeth pulled at the same time i was given a choice of being knocked out and not, i instantly chose to be knocked out so i wouldnt have to deal with it
[2022-12-27 06:48:20] <@%MiniKatalyst> last time I had local anaesthetic I was getting an ingrown nail cut and my Dr put like 4/5 doses in and it still wouldnt numb the area. He was trying to cut the nail and I was squealling more than the children getting needles in the office next door
[2022-12-27 06:48:23] <%Lakart> Yeah I was originally gonna get put under and then I showed up and he went "you know it'll be way quicker if we do it awake" so I went for it
[2022-12-27 06:48:28] <ShadowsparksTV> The sounds of hearing your own tooth being crushed and pulled out is wild.
[2022-12-27 06:49:10] <Boveip> ^ I don't think I'd want to hear it. our skull acoustics are.. weird
[2022-12-27 06:49:11] <+thunderdan11> and im very nty about that sound/feeling

[2022-12-27 06:50:05] <%+Lunar_Lucy> It depends if your teeth are out and pullable or if they are too far below or stuck or whatever

[2022-12-27 07:18:14] <ShowtimeTylers> they hate them mostly because careless owners allow children to have access to their weapons
[2022-12-27 07:18:28] <%+Lunar_Lucy> In the end the gun is just anther tool. And some people should not be handed certain tools.

[2022-12-27 07:19:57] <+JonathanTech> Thing is, gun laws only hurt law abiding citizens. The criminals won’t be stopped by any of the laws

[2022-12-27 07:30:22] <+acecobalt> Shouldn't countries without guns have much lower suicide rate then?
[2022-12-27 07:30:39] <MaydaySunnyside> The biggest problem I feel like is that a lot of people just aren't willing to entertain the attempt. Okay, let's say the waiting period doesn't help, for example. What exactly does that hurt? beside gun business?
[2022-12-27 07:30:41] <+justfaytal> suicide isn't restricted to guns?

[2022-12-27 07:31:10] <+JonathanTech> The waiting period becomes a problem when it’s the person that is seeking their first gun for self protection because they’re likely to be target for the crimes of passion or abuse

[2022-12-27 08:40:31] <+Teeras101> but like if i kill a wild pig i take it to a pressure wash car wash and spray it with tire degreaser then soap and then the high pressure was just to get the mud and musk off

[2022-12-27 08:42:23] <ShowtimeTylers> I read that bear meat either tastes fishy or sweet depending on what they eat, and the fishy taste is really hard to get rid of
[2022-12-27 08:42:34] <%+Usinji> @DumpsterGravy lol yeah it does
[2022-12-27 08:42:38] <CommunismForDummies> one too many stories about greased hogs

[2022-12-27 08:42:58] <%K9kroz> You just have to cage the hog and feed it. When it is happy, you can kill it without the panic musk
[2022-12-27 08:43:04] <+Teeras101> i mean its pressure washed with plenty water before its cleaned
[2022-12-27 08:43:10] <%Darmanimon> germaphobes typically trust cleaning chemicals over having anything even remotely dirty, my clean freak boss used to wash his apples with soap

[2022-12-27 09:05:13] <+LeksiW> have you killed a moose yet?
[2022-12-27 09:05:46] <+LeksiW> that could be a nice goal, to get yourself some moose
[2022-12-27 09:05:46] <%K9kroz> There are Meese?
[2022-12-27 09:05:48] <Tsarok> are moose scarier than bears?
[2022-12-27 09:05:50] <max1hundred> I've as of today found all of the specialty rifles
[2022-12-27 09:05:54] <smorcing1993> @Richard_Hammer  hi SMOrc, so what is this game end goal?

[2022-12-27 09:08:55] <+LeksiW> lots of people have been asking for this and their finally giving us an item this coming year
[2022-12-27 09:09:01] <%Darmanimon> adding first nation people's cultural elements and crafting recipes seems like a neat idea if well executed
[2022-12-27 09:09:15] <+LeksiW> do you have the expansion? Tales from the Far Territories
[2022-12-27 09:09:18] <$Rararawr> I feel like I should be the one answering this as my streets are snow but I own neither of these things
[2022-12-27 09:09:26] <+LeksiW> it'll be in the expansion
[2022-12-27 09:09:46] <+LeksiW> the expansion includes 2 new zones, 1 quite large and challenging

[2022-12-27 09:30:42] <EngeltheFallen> i gave up cable ten years ago
[2022-12-27 09:30:43] <%Dyrk> the way twitch runs ads, might as well be back to TV
[2022-12-27 09:30:49] <%EpicPumaNess> I'd much rather play a video game, then watch TV

[2022-12-27 09:31:28] <EngeltheFallen> no need for a green screen really
[2022-12-27 09:31:30] <$stringSlaps> i think enough people out there would rather listen to real people talking rather than watch tv, the gameplay is a bonus

[2022-12-27 09:32:04] <ThatLittleRedBird> greenscreen is out of fashion, it's all about having a big open room behind you to pop off and run around in

[2022-12-27 09:33:06] <+LeksiW> what's your main gaming genre?
[2022-12-27 09:33:30] <jfine4all> I think the biggest attraction on twitch right now is games streamers can play with their viewers
[2022-12-27 09:33:32] <+TheMM42> If you decided to try and attract new viewers what would you try?

[2022-12-27 09:36:57] <%Spurpshub> there's definitely people who wouldn't have made it without promotion from other streamers
[2022-12-27 09:37:03] <Stonan> If only you could burn this many calories sleeping.
[2022-12-27 09:37:08] <%+Destrina> If you don't have the streaming je ne sais quoi, you don't have it and nothing can help you.

[2022-12-27 09:37:34] <%Lakart> I follow some people who have been doing it as long or longer than Dick and put in way more actual "effort" who still get jack shit for views in comparison.

[2022-12-27 09:43:21] <%EpicPumaNess> That's why I can't get into streaming, I'm super bad at talking, let alone when I've got noone to converse with

[2022-12-27 09:43:24] <Deleroth> LUL one of the reasons why I have so many hours watching you is exactly that. you're not the hypecaster sort that youtubers tend to be
[2022-12-27 09:43:31] <%$templarofflame> ive seen you like 1-2 times on my day time streams like billy1kirby

[2022-12-27 09:43:45] <%EpicPumaNess> @Deleroth fr, I hate the 'hype' streamers they're so fucking annoying imo
[2022-12-27 09:43:46] <ThatLittleRedBird> I would be the same way, I can talk for hours, but I need the other people to feed me the initial spark

[2022-12-27 09:45:35] <%Lakart> He just got so big he didn't actually have to play games anymore, he could just rant endlessly with a game paused in the background.
[2022-12-27 09:45:38] <+usernameguy> he had a really intense shtick, must've been hard
[2022-12-27 09:45:54] <%+LeksiW> yup

[2022-12-27 09:46:56] <Deleroth> @eEKBAh yeah recently, for years his schtick has been the same, even when he didn't stream for a year he wasn't blowing up his channel like he did recently
[2022-12-27 09:46:59] <%+LeksiW> like you start sad and you finish happy
[2022-12-27 09:47:02] <Autodestructive> @poopbeast give it time... first 3 months you look like shit, then go to the barber, they're gonna get rid of most of it, but leave a nice and clean facial hair layer... then go from there, just grow that thing slowly

[2022-12-27 09:48:31] <%+eEKBAh> @Deleroth I guess depends how you define recent. I had to stop following him about 2 years ago because I couldn't watch his depression spiral
[2022-12-27 09:48:34] <Tewma2> Also depends how many hours you have to dedicate to work. I work about 4-5 hours a day and it rarely feels like work these days.
[2022-12-27 09:48:39] <%+LeksiW> gorgeous sun
[2022-12-27 09:48:43] <%EpicPumaNess> its like me going to the gym, the hardest part is getting there, but once I'm there, I'm ready to go
[2022-12-27 09:48:51] <ShowtimeTylers> It’s nice that you enjoy streaming but the fact is that it’s an extremely volatile occupation. This could all go away over night
[2022-12-27 09:48:53] <+usernameguy> Agree; but I insist on having fun at jobs lately, somehow, though
[2022-12-27 09:48:55] <!%+RevBanger> yea
[2022-12-27 09:49:02] <ShowtimeTylers> I agree with that

[2022-12-27 09:49:26] <+snakepissdiablo_> yeah when you turn your passion into a career it losing something

[2022-12-27 09:49:29] <ShowtimeTylers> That’s why it took me so long to find a job I liked

[2022-12-27 10:32:35] <Krolja> @ChromeViper I learned REAL quick how unaccepting my small town of 1200 people was. Most of the stuff I grew up with centered around religion more than race, though
[2022-12-27 10:32:43] <$ranDOmbaNdGirl> one of my first experiences with racism was in the 3rd grade when a girl kept trying to convince me I had black blood. I was then forced to go to her birthday party.

[2022-12-27 10:43:46] <+snakepissdiablo_> if Elon didn't get government subsidies he wouldn't be able to be afloat he actually has a bunch of fishy ties to the US government propping him up for a while

[2022-12-27 10:45:03] <+gravbike> i don't care if they are billionaires, i just want them to stay in their little castles and stop prancing around looking for attention constantly
[2022-12-27 10:45:05] <+xAlaskanxBearx> Can we make a Cult of Dick?
[2022-12-27 10:45:10] <%+BubbatheScrub> I mean, the thing about billionaires is they're just as squishy and weak as anyone else that's never worked a day in their life.

[2022-12-27 10:45:37] <%alwiro> @tyrolia_valerian even further. exchange the word celebrity with hero/saint/entity and it goes back to the very beginning.

[2022-12-27 10:45:48] <+snakepissdiablo_> lol gates bezos and musks parents were all very rich and basically funded their startup businesses🤣🤣🤣
[2022-12-27 10:45:50] <$kewtyp> I think what you said earlier applies to Musk worship too for sure, money = success, and people go gaga for success
[2022-12-27 10:46:03] <evil_din> there is nothing you can do about it, so why worry
[2022-12-27 10:46:07] <%KiddProQuo> He's a polarizing figure more now than he was six months ago. If you are pro or against him, a lot of people will make up their mind about you based on that. So I think people who want to defend him have leaned into doing it irrationally.
[2022-12-27 10:46:07] <+xAlaskanxBearx> Chat, he didn’t say we couldn’t start a cult for him...
[2022-12-27 10:46:10] <%KiddProQuo> Like that guy.

[2022-12-27 10:47:16] <%Spurpshub> i mean... 1 million adjusted for inflation may be a lot more than you think it is.
[2022-12-27 10:47:22] <%Dyrk> is it a sex cult?

[2022-12-27 11:15:40] <%Dyrk> my grandfather made head cheese, tongue doesn't seem so bad
[2022-12-27 11:15:47] <thorggrim83> @gravbike  U should try BullPenis then Kreygasm
[2022-12-27 11:15:49] <nightperson1> Would get them at a taco truck near my home and from time to time the tongue was gross
[2022-12-27 11:16:00] <+Teeras101> do you eat hummas
[2022-12-27 11:16:13] <+Teeras101> i recently just tried it and its awesome
[2022-12-27 11:16:15] <%Spurpshub> i got pigs trotters once from a chinese takeaway. i don't get it
[2022-12-27 11:16:19] <%Spurpshub> no redeeming qualities
[2022-12-27 11:16:24] <+Derminion> I used to eat cow tongue burgers and I didn't even realize it was tongue until someone told me
[2022-12-27 11:16:26] <strobbens> @strobbens We export like 70% of what we produce full stop

[2022-12-27 11:17:09] <+Teeras101> @EnigmaticRepose i dont care for blood
[2022-12-27 11:17:11] <+justlikemikeyj> I’ve always looked at this game and thought of playing it.  Is there an Endgame?  Or just survive?
[2022-12-27 11:17:19] <%alwiro> @strobbens that is quite interesting. over here in germany whatever is left of meatproduction usually makes it's way into farm/fishfood
[2022-12-27 11:17:46] <+Teeras101> i dont care for the irony taste that is blood
[2022-12-27 11:17:53] <nightperson1> I draw my food line with blood sausage
[2022-12-27 11:17:59] <$JudgementSenshi> Wonder if they fixed the softlocks from the story mode
[2022-12-27 11:18:03] <yamiangelous> I mean outside of meat....look at the kinda other stuff that's had bad info spread about it like MSG for instance.
[2022-12-27 11:18:04] <%Dyrk> derivative12 it's a mixture of body parts thrown into the skull and cooked until it's gelatinized
[2022-12-27 11:18:14] <thorggrim83> @justlikemikeyj  Theres a Story with bossbattles dialogue ect
[2022-12-27 11:18:19] <EnigmaticRepose> @Teeras101 haggis doesn't have blood as an ingredient pretty sure
[2022-12-27 11:18:19] <+Teeras101> MSG is wonderful
[2022-12-27 11:18:25] <%Spurpshub> the bear boss battle is odd

[2022-12-27 11:20:14] <+Teeras101> @Spurpshub you can always use amazon
