[2022-12-31 19:22:48] <@%^StreamElements> It is the 2020 Oscars and Tom Hanks stands at the podium to announce Best Actor. “Boy,” he says, “we got a real competition this year! Johnny Depp, Leo DiCaprio, George Clooney, anyone could win!” The world holds its breath to see who will win the most prestigious acting award in the world. “Wow!” says Hanks. “I don’t believe it! The winner is Feno in his ‘Unsponsered’ Raid shadow legends stream!”
