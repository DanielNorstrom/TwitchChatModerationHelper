[2022-12-24 10:51:41] <Gerwich> "Concerning the dormouse's name, etymonline says "long-tailed Old World rodent noted for its state of semi-hibernation in winter, early 15c., possibly from Anglo-French dormouse 'tending to be dormant' (from stem of dormir 'to sleep,' see dormant), with the second element mistaken for mouse; or perhaps it is from a Middle English dialectal compound of mouse (n.) and Middle French dormir. French dormeuse, fem. of dormeur 'sleeper' is attested only from 17c."" This is a dingdang pokemon name

[2022-12-24 11:50:08] <%+Admiral_PopnFresh> Matcha is much less plant-flavored than loose leaf tea
[2022-12-24 11:50:09] <cloffbug> matcha is a very special taste. it goes well with almost anything but its also very tea'y
[2022-12-24 11:50:26] <%Atchinson> with matcha you drink the whole plant instead of of just the broth so it tastes even more like grass

[2022-12-24 12:44:21] <Turret49> It's not that bad, it's just slow to get around in it
[2022-12-24 12:44:21] <Dvoraki> its not that bad now but it was hard when I was 7
[2022-12-24 12:44:22] <+masumi_tv> This temple is pretty ok on the 3DS tbh
[2022-12-24 12:44:27] <%Snowytales> froot is is a frog themed lich now
[2022-12-24 12:44:28] <$Namington2D> cut and rigged in live2d
[2022-12-24 12:44:29] <i_am_jessa> She's a lich but she's been in chibi mode with cute frog outfit for awhile
[2022-12-24 12:44:37] <Foldedmetal> @Namington2D but have they ever done it with a real person
[2022-12-24 12:44:38] VIEWERS: 295
[2022-12-24 12:44:46] <%jimmy_mapp> @Namington2D I'd love to see that
[2022-12-24 12:44:49] <Foldedmetal> Live2D rig a photo of Abraham lincoln
[2022-12-24 12:44:57] <nossnitro102> Blue Tektites I believe is the name.
[2022-12-24 12:44:59] <Turret49> Tektites?
[2022-12-24 12:45:18] <skubagator> after the Hank Hill vtuber, IDK what you could even do to push the envelope further
[2022-12-24 12:45:24] <Foldedmetal> yeah but that's goodjared
[2022-12-24 12:45:26] <$Namington2D> i possess the skills to do that maybe... giruteAWoozy
[2022-12-24 12:45:34] <%godot_was_here> why yes!
[2022-12-24 12:45:35] <Duckels> hank is on twitch now?
[2022-12-24 12:45:35] <%Yimes__> Yep
[2022-12-24 12:45:35] <%mauno_mau> Yeah
[2022-12-24 12:45:36] <VelourDoge> Yeeeeah
[2022-12-24 12:45:37] <Turret49> Yes
[2022-12-24 12:45:37] <%godot_was_here> how could you tell
[2022-12-24 12:45:39] <skubagator> yes
[2022-12-24 12:45:40] <nossnitro102> YEP!
[2022-12-24 12:45:42] <Masuyuu> mhm
[2022-12-24 12:45:42] <%zeritoot> yup
[2022-12-24 12:45:43] <skubagator> it's very annoying
[2022-12-24 12:45:43] <CalebHorusVT> Have fun :)
[2022-12-24 12:45:45] <nossnitro102> CONSTANTLY!
[2022-12-24 12:45:46] <%Atchinson> that's one of them
[2022-12-24 12:45:46] <%Cakesenemy> Also a huge part of the issues
[2022-12-24 12:45:46] <+SASVULTURE> Shes a psychic she can see the future
[2022-12-24 12:45:46] <%SkeletonDance_> sigbirdBirdheh
[2022-12-24 12:45:48] <Foldedmetal> game design good :)
[2022-12-24 12:45:50] <turgaul> this is the top gripe

[2022-12-24 12:45:52] <%jimmy_mapp> clauviThumbsup
[2022-12-24 12:45:56] <Duckels> one of just a few issues
[2022-12-24 12:45:56] <$Namington2D> OoT3D let you bind it to a button
[2022-12-24 12:45:58] <nossnitro102> EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
[2022-12-24 12:45:59] <%MaverickCameron> it's actually the boot temple
[2022-12-24 12:46:01] <+masumi_tv> The 3DS version fixed this
[2022-12-24 12:46:05] <%Yimes__> They should have made it an item clauviPout
[2022-12-24 12:46:07] <cloffbug> i think there is a remake or a mod that makes the iron boots a hotkey item because the original is so tedious
[2022-12-24 12:46:09] <%BlueBlazeGX> There are mods that make it tons less tedious. Even in the 3DS version, theres a button right on the bottom screen instead fo it
[2022-12-24 12:46:25] <%Atchinson> the 3ds version made the boots a c-button item
[2022-12-24 12:46:31] <i_am_jessa> Just macro it geegaNODDERS
[2022-12-24 12:46:31] <$Namington2D> it's preeeetty bad

[2022-12-24 12:46:38] VIEWERS: 288
[2022-12-24 12:46:44] <skubagator> in some other zelda games they made iron boots an item so you don't need to pause to take them off, but yeah....

[2022-12-24 12:46:50] <+masumi_tv> airiCOPIUM not that bad
[2022-12-24 12:47:09] <%godot_was_here> it is, in point of fact, that bad

[2022-12-24 12:47:38] <%BlueBlazeGX> @SkeletonDance_ Did it involve a single key, per chance?
