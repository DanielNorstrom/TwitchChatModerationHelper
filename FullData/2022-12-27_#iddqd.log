[2022-12-27 10:32:31] <%+mademedothis_> does quick scope shoot faster
[2022-12-27 10:32:33] <Clapts> The thing about quick scoping that I don't like is that it makes you shoot slower so I rarely do it
[2022-12-27 10:32:47] <%baguet7e> ok i'll give it a shot
[2022-12-27 10:32:52] <shruggy08> i thought it was better because the triangle
[2022-12-27 10:32:53] <%Lurieh> isn't there a little delay to quick scoping though?
[2022-12-27 10:32:58] <%crocodile69420> depending on the range it could hit the target quicker since there's no travel time
[2022-12-27 10:33:04] <%+B_aguette_> does quickscoping vs not quickscoping actually change anything? NOTED
[2022-12-27 10:33:06] <+yayza> @mademedothis_ quick scope makes the shots hitscan i think

[2022-12-27 10:33:22] <%+tyhigh23> @Lurieh no scoiping is hitscan no scoping is projectile
[2022-12-27 10:33:23] <%crocodile69420> @B_aguette_  when ur scoped in it's hitscan, when ur not it's a projectile
[2022-12-27 10:33:27] <Baconpancake123> i can see why it might be disorienting for some people

[2022-12-27 10:33:59] <%Lurieh> @tyhigh23 yea it's hitscan, but you have to wait for the scoping animation, so a little preshoting might still be necessary

[2022-12-27 12:30:07] <beetrootman69> yeah if you cant reach monitor hz, its better to tunr on vsync and gsync in nvidia control panel, and limit fps 3-4 below monitor hz

[2022-12-27 12:30:49] <LambertExe> if you have gsync and lot latency mode enabled or ultra in nvidia drivers, just enable vsync in gmae - this will automatically cap framerate below refresh rate to prevent normal vsync from kicking in and game will use gsync instead

[2022-12-27 13:06:53] <@%+daisy82078> AAAA
[2022-12-27 13:07:02] <%ElGatoMatador> top 500 was goated
[2022-12-27 13:07:04] <@%Oshleyy> old symbols BibleThump
[2022-12-27 13:07:05] <%stursey> they look more like Pokemon gym badges LUL
[2022-12-27 13:07:07] <gtFD___> well its the same to silver thats something Kappa
[2022-12-27 13:07:10] <ninobscuram> new plat icon is the worst one
[2022-12-27 13:07:17] <Beruka> new plat is closer to gm XD at least the color
[2022-12-27 13:07:20] <%Pocketkos> Plat and diamond difference is the backlight AAAA
[2022-12-27 13:07:23] <%panohanskat> i meant new symbols in game are basically the same
[2022-12-27 13:07:25] <+aj7continue> the no outline is a design mistake 101
[2022-12-27 13:07:26] <%ElGatoMatador> @ninobscuram gm is pretty horrible too
[2022-12-27 13:07:32] <%KiraisGod> the old ones are way better
[2022-12-27 13:07:33] <Siige> they payd someone to redesign them and now they dont wanna spend more money PepeLaugh
[2022-12-27 13:07:37] <%ElGatoMatador> masters is literally the only good one
[2022-12-27 13:07:39] <%AxisZtv> like look at diamond
[2022-12-27 13:07:40] <%Hykrewl> new ones just look too dull
[2022-12-27 13:07:42] <%+AGirlCalledJim> Diamond used to literally look like a diamind... now, generic symbol
[2022-12-27 13:07:44] <%5ylvan> shadows
[2022-12-27 13:07:48] <oWither> holy shit side by side the old symbols are so much better
[2022-12-27 13:07:48] <%Kkaiiiju> thats what happens if you're going for simplicity
[2022-12-27 13:07:53] <+Smoutebollen> the old ones had 1/2/3/4/5 segments for bronze - diamond, the new ones don't seem to
[2022-12-27 13:07:56] <%+Scuffed_shoe> @iddqd Can you review a game of mine and see if I deserve higher than diamond?
[2022-12-27 13:07:56] <%CRminus> The icons whent on a diet
[2022-12-27 13:07:57] <%Goryllo> there were just cleaner
[2022-12-27 13:07:59] <wren_art> old icon is thicc NODDERS
[2022-12-27 13:08:01] <valeska143> its more minimal now
[2022-12-27 13:08:04] <Siige> they just shouldnt use nearly the same colour for plat diamond silver and gm PepeLaugh
[2022-12-27 13:08:05] <OnlyVaL> why most of new ones like same color
[2022-12-27 13:08:06] <+MasterCaxe> It's like a comic design vs a really bad Netflix Live Action Adaptation
[2022-12-27 13:08:16] <%Sanbyou> Top 500 looks like a golden turtle
[2022-12-27 13:08:18] <shruggy08> they should keep the old bronze to diamond and make the master gm and top 500 light up on the old ones
[2022-12-27 13:08:23] <+aj7continue> the new GM is literally the worst
[2022-12-27 13:08:25] <+bnwdenied> @Smoutebollen ???? they literally have 1/2/3/4/5 symbols

[2022-12-27 13:08:51] <CHICKEN2XD> High ranks are better in 2 but metal ranks are better in 1
[2022-12-27 13:08:52] <BlackSiilv3r> master and top 500 are the only solid ones from new ones everytjing else was better in old ones
[2022-12-27 13:08:53] <@%Oshleyy> detail and thickness
[2022-12-27 13:08:54] <ravenfromabyss> 2
[2022-12-27 13:08:55] <+aj7continue> no, old icons are chunky
[2022-12-27 13:08:55] <%AxisZtv> diamond was actually a diamond. Masters now just looks like gold just slightly shinier
[2022-12-27 13:08:56] <+Kavanicus> its outline and the lack of a cohesive design system
[2022-12-27 13:08:56] <ishtarwillow> 1
[2022-12-27 13:08:58] <%ElGatoMatador> i think its size
[2022-12-27 13:08:58] <%itsalchemy_> The old ones 100%
[2022-12-27 13:08:58] <Fettor> 1 is more shiny
[2022-12-27 13:08:58] <%HK_Shobu> the simplicity
[2022-12-27 13:08:59] <%+GoLoseFast1> they should make the ow2 ones have the same style as the ow1 ones and then they would look somewhat decent
[2022-12-27 13:09:04] <%TacticalPew> bigger and easier to differentiate
[2022-12-27 13:09:04] <%+Jashugan> the size also grows with the rank, unlike the new ones
[2022-12-27 13:09:04] <%Goryllo> no. the design of old ones was just much cleaner @iddqd
[2022-12-27 13:09:04] <%+SvipkeTV> It has less open space than the new one, so it looks more compact.
[2022-12-27 13:09:08] <%+cheshirelime> Ow2 symbols look downgraded
[2022-12-27 13:09:09] <%Goryllo> new ones are messy
[2022-12-27 13:09:13] <hmsood> if they werent labelled, would you be able to put the new ones in order? i couldnt
[2022-12-27 13:09:15] <semhsp> i think also there's less thickness difference so they feel more balanced
[2022-12-27 13:09:16] <+bnwdenied> bronze -> plat are alright but the rest nah
[2022-12-27 13:09:16] <%itsalchemy_> I like the old Masters, GM, and T500 so much more
[2022-12-27 13:09:17] <MrTeall> Goal 1 is for them to be recognisable and 2 doesn‚Äôt achieve that
[2022-12-27 13:09:23] <gtFD___> old glow better NODDERS
[2022-12-27 13:09:24] <%TacticalPew> classic
[2022-12-27 13:09:26] <%KiraisGod> the new ones should be bigger and bigger outline
[2022-12-27 13:09:27] <+aj7continue> almost everyone voted for old icons
[2022-12-27 13:09:29] <Graxxle> In game the colour shades look so messed up for some ranks and no one studies the shapes enough to know the rank
[2022-12-27 13:09:30] <%KiraisGod> to be ez to tell
[2022-12-27 13:09:34] <+aj7continue> that makes all of us classic
[2022-12-27 13:09:35] <%AxisZtv> doesn't matter because you can't even see them in game....
[2022-12-27 13:09:39] <%itsalchemy_> They‚Äôre just sharper
[2022-12-27 13:09:40] <%+Scuffed_shoe> @iddqd Can I have a game review?
[2022-12-27 13:09:41] <%+GoLoseFast1> plus the border with numbers makes the new ranks look even uglier
[2022-12-27 13:09:45] <%Hykrewl> GM for 2 is so ugly smh
[2022-12-27 13:09:49] <Enzo_q8i> 1 is way better
[2022-12-27 13:09:58] <+Kavanicus> the new ones feel like they are trying to do multiple different things poorly. Old ones had a cohesive system they stuck to, and they stood out more clearly
[2022-12-27 13:09:59] <%+Qffset> they're valorant-ifying the whole ranked system
[2022-12-27 13:10:03] <%KiraisGod> @iddqd tbh blizz doesnt want us to see the ranks anyway
[2022-12-27 13:10:04] <waposs> boomer..

[2022-12-27 16:15:30] <%nannakki> why aim when you can let the controller do it

[2022-12-27 16:18:44] <Fair_Squared> The turn off crossplay is cope too. If you turn it off on pc you search forever to get matches and end up in 150+ ping lobbies
[2022-12-27 16:18:44] <+iradallas> I HATE THE AIM ASSIST, NOT THE VIDEO

[2022-12-27 16:20:02] <niko2shae> atleast on overwatch controller kids dont get AA
[2022-12-27 16:20:05] <%+gomattzilla> sorta, most teams have bangalore bc smoke cancels aim assist lol
[2022-12-27 16:20:06] <Imperius_AZN> 1 controller, 2 mnk or you dont win
[2022-12-27 16:20:08] <v1nuka> the smg aim assist is just insane in apex
[2022-12-27 16:20:10] <+x0efj3m> they gotta keep the controller playerbase somehow
[2022-12-27 16:20:11] <%Reifuu> controller is SO MUCH better in close quarters that it's a joke
[2022-12-27 16:20:12] <dejapoo_> you want to take advantage of AA at close range but most fights still start at long
[2022-12-27 16:20:12] <%spartanpr0ner> you have no chance against rollers but the mainpoint in playing mouse is that you have a better vision of situations

[2022-12-27 16:20:26] <%Darth_Jiggles> NODDERS the controller is there for consistency, aa works effectively through visual clutter and counters the majority of movement in apex
[2022-12-27 16:20:32] <dejapoo_> SMG on rollers is too good in apex at close range though
[2022-12-27 16:20:34] <+masterlearner21> idk but I know snipedown isn't allowed to use snipe, so I'm guessing controllers aren't allowed snipe
[2022-12-27 16:20:35] <dh1time> @niko2shae we do lol
[2022-12-27 16:20:38] <xetehx> I spent like 1k hours trying to get good at apex just to die to roller players 90% of the time Sadge

[2022-12-27 17:13:03] <Fair_Squared> lol show kiriko or ana
[2022-12-27 17:13:09] <BirdBroTV> IDD-daddy play Fortnite instead :)))))))))))))))))))))
[2022-12-27 17:13:09] <Juvenyle_> Kiriko lol
[2022-12-27 17:13:09] <eglozeatsomepotato> Mercy is "hard to play"
[2022-12-27 17:13:10] <TheRick_Astley> widow
[2022-12-27 17:13:12] <allstar_moon> I've seen videos of mercy's doing a quintuple kill, is it that easy?
[2022-12-27 17:13:12] <%NinjaFaceTV> when you play Kiriko is it similar?
[2022-12-27 17:13:13] <beeri12hh> jay3Truuuu jay3Smile jay3Smile
[2022-12-27 17:13:13] <Zeirem> Shooting her feels like shooting at the thin side of a paper towel.
[2022-12-27 17:13:16] <+burntpix3l> kirko
[2022-12-27 17:13:23] <+burntpix3l> see if her hand really plays a factor
[2022-12-27 17:13:24] <Jay__OW> seems legit
[2022-12-27 17:13:25] <Fair_Squared> genji and tracer have massive hirtboxes
[2022-12-27 17:13:26] <%+sc00basteve> How about the tiniest hb? Kiriko?
[2022-12-27 17:13:26] <allstar_moon> this is insane dude
[2022-12-27 17:13:27] <Magniitude> they just have better aim EZ
[2022-12-27 17:13:31] <MARCPN> do mercy herself
[2022-12-27 17:13:36] <%Nytan_TW> ye
[2022-12-27 17:13:37] <%Friedolf> her hand didn't save her
[2022-12-27 17:13:39] <SpinKing14> His headshot is as low as his chest too for genji
[2022-12-27 17:13:40] <+burntpix3l> aim more to the left
[2022-12-27 17:13:42] <beeri12hh> skill issue
[2022-12-27 17:13:42] <%x_LilacSky> that is actually fucked
[2022-12-27 17:13:45] <shaepukku> tracer?
[2022-12-27 17:13:46] <+burntpix3l> want to see if her hand blocks it
[2022-12-27 17:13:47] <%atrexyo_at> consider battle mercy main :)
[2022-12-27 17:13:48] <Vorkender> I wish widow had that projectile size
[2022-12-27 17:13:48] <%NinjaFaceTV> if you are Kiriko are her projectiles massive too?

[2022-12-27 17:13:58] <%+Fhyron> thw wings on mercy is a hitbox?
[2022-12-27 17:14:00] <dejapoo_> no wonder headshots seem easy for some people. i'm aiming center mass and trying to lift up into the head, they're aiming at the head but still have the same hitbox
[2022-12-27 17:14:00] <KillahPwnz> what about cassidy's hitbox? like AS Cassidy
[2022-12-27 17:14:01] <%+TSgtSeuss> Is JQ's head hitbox the size of her body with Mercy shooting?
[2022-12-27 17:14:02] <wren_art> that's why they buff the ammo it's the most important thing for Mercy Kappa
