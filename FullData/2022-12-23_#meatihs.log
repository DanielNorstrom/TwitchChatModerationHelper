[2022-12-23 00:18:10] <lutero94> Mild tonsillitis often doesn't need any treatment. However, it is important to drink plenty of water. Paracetamol or ibuprofen will help to ease pain, headache and high temperature. Gargles, lozenges and sprays may help to soothe a sore throat but they do not shorten the illness.

[2022-12-23 00:18:38] <+balansero87> If you have a sore tonsil and are feeling ill, it is important to take care of yourself and get plenty of rest. Here are some steps you can take to feel better:  Drink plenty of fluids: Water, juice, and broth can help to soothe your throat and keep you hydrated.  Eat soothing foods: Soft, bland foods like soup, yogurt, and mashed potatoes can be easier on your sore throat.  Take over-the-counter pain medication: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help to reduce pain and inflammation.  Avoid

[2022-12-23 00:19:06] <HunterPiazza> Mild tonsillitis often doesn't need any treatment. However, it is important to drink plenty of water. Paracetamol or ibuprofen will help to ease pain, headache and high temperature. Gargles, lozenges and sprays may help to soothe a sore throat but they do not shorten the illness.

[2022-12-23 02:47:10] <nachowelas> cubelock goat deck
[2022-12-23 02:47:11] <Halluzinate1> doomguard + cube :)
[2022-12-23 02:47:11] <authorJeMac> I like charge
[2022-12-23 02:47:14] <ShawarmaSellerU> because of Cubelock
[2022-12-23 02:47:15] <Divvix> Same reason they nerfed mr smite :)
[2022-12-23 02:47:18] <smoby06> do they?
[2022-12-23 02:47:19] <ArgentinaCampeon181222> all my homies love doomguard
[2022-12-23 02:47:25] <hojden> they hate charge in warlock but curses are fine
[2022-12-23 02:47:28] <smoby06> the players hated mr smite and galvangar lol
[2022-12-23 02:47:29] <Halluzinate1> i miss mr "i am in charge" patches :(
[2022-12-23 02:47:30] <+Lunarb00mer> Blizzard hates charge but makes a class with a charge hero power
[2022-12-23 02:47:31] <burpu24> people dont like charge look mr smite
[2022-12-23 02:47:39] <achooh00> doomgurad cube ez
[2022-12-23 02:47:41] <cloister0> blizzard printed the downgraded doomguard after a decade EleGiggle
[2022-12-23 02:47:45] <+darthmijas> @meatihs they decided to tune down on charge at that time. then they printed a 6/6 give charge to all ;)
[2022-12-23 02:47:56] <golem123_> Scyte + quest is better than classic dh quest?
[2022-12-23 02:47:59] <ejvald> in the combination of cube and warlock dk, doomguard wasn't really fun to face
[2022-12-23 02:48:00] <Divvix> mr smite did nothing wrong
[2022-12-23 02:48:05] <hojden> mr smite was something else

[2022-12-23 02:48:45] <+darthmijas> Mr smite's only fault was it coming from the finished quest.
