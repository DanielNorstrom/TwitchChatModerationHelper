[2023-01-01 20:11:30] <csoulides> you can upgrade
[2023-01-01 20:11:31] <+LtAscott> you can upgrade in game but its hard and expensive

[2023-01-01 20:12:52] <Blaasram1> @kevinsredz  so its worth to buy more exspensive game? and what is the difference between usec oe bear? does it make a difference for like in game expreriance
[2023-01-01 20:12:54] <cropd_> @Deathmatch46 35min q on scav haha
[2023-01-01 20:13:28] <%KevinSredz> @Blaasram1 only makes a difference on Lighthouse against rogues currently. They are more friendly towards BEAR. But other than that its just cosmetic difference and starting gear.

[2023-01-01 20:13:52] <%KevinSredz> @Blaasram1 if you want an easier more convenient time, buy the more expensive versions. Cheaper = more grind
[2023-01-01 20:14:04] <+LtAscott> @cosmic_pp its spring

[2023-01-01 20:14:32] <Blaasram1> @kevinsredz  what class is advised other starting weapons with differnce stats (like better stats or not)
[2023-01-01 20:14:40] <WalkinJunk> late spring is best
[2023-01-01 20:14:44] <%Dragonlord54> @Blaasram1 You get more stuff with the better editions of the game gamma container which is 3x3, more inventory space, more rep with traders and such, or for faction its just preference BEAR is russian and USEC is english, however on the lighthouse map the rogue ai are more linent toward USEC as BEAR gets shot on sight
[2023-01-01 20:14:50] <%KevinSredz> @Blaasram1 no difference. Its just AK or M4
[2023-01-01 20:15:09] <%+cosmic_pp> @cosmic_pp you would be correct i was baiting lol

[2023-01-01 20:18:07] <%KevinSredz> @Blaasram1 you can buy standard edition... then later pay the difference for EOD or other version, and the upgrades get updated on your account
[2023-01-01 20:18:12] <%+Justsaywhn> FACTS! Literally early wipe gunfights are so enjoyable to watch. its not just a 1 tap everytime

[2023-01-01 20:18:16] <%KevinSredz> so you can upgade mid-wipe if you want

[2023-01-01 20:37:55] <heimvartheapprentice> @junglejake I love the designated marksman and the gorka pants 😎 bear ftw
[2023-01-01 20:37:58] <%YinYangSparty> yeah thats been a thing for as long as i have been playing for like 2 years
[2023-01-01 20:38:04] <%+junglejake> @Day_Dot fr. all the usec early clothes suckkkk
[2023-01-01 20:38:28] <%+junglejake> @heimvartheapprentice ive always gone usec and now its like hmmmmmmmm maybe not worth
[2023-01-01 20:39:11] <+SnoopDotSnail> I would just like to be able to play streets lol - Laggiest mess and crashes

[2023-01-01 20:40:03] <nsn_strike> I'm assuming the answer would be no considering how long its been, but is that weapon balance podcast with nikita from like 6 months ago ever going to happen? feels like you're the only person with a platform who wants more realistic recoil.
[2023-01-01 20:40:21] <heimvartheapprentice> I cannot wait for body armor areas dude let me hit a man in the ear and not have it dmg his helmet plz @junglejake welllll I mean there's a bug with bears that's making them louder so the drip is almost not worth it 😂
[2023-01-01 20:40:33] <$tonyzeee> Thoughts on cold plunges? They seem to really be in right now

[2023-01-01 20:41:41] <ADEN0SINE> thats heavy for a gun my fully decked AR doesnt even come close to that
[2023-01-01 20:41:42] <%+Broku92> ya, i wish attachments didn't make the gun
[2023-01-01 20:41:51] <Vonkv> i hope they remake gunplay and consider bullets damage, velocity and recoil
[2023-01-01 20:41:55] <bmac1572> I remember like 3 years ago recoil was a lot less. Then the community complained and BSG raised all guns recoil.
[2023-01-01 20:42:06] <Tristan6511> Nice to see you playing Tarkov again !
[2023-01-01 20:42:09] <nsn_strike> yep I agree with you, I just wish this could be brought to nikita
[2023-01-01 20:42:13] <heimvartheapprentice> I think we all support this 😂 we're all kinda tired of the recoil in this game

[2023-01-01 20:43:17] <+Silksojo> I think the biggest peeve I have with the recoil is how its just an enormous initial kick, it doesn't climb or recoil in a way that feels reasonable lol

I have a 70% survival rate and all my deaths are to scavs either through bushes and trees or from 80 plus meters away. my friends and I go for pvp now and avoid scavs in all cases now because is insane
[2023-01-01 20:44:40] <heimvartheapprentice> @junglejake yeah I'm the only friend in my friend group who goes bear they all gave me a fair warning

[2023-01-01 21:24:05] <Bozcape> It's nice of you to show people that you shouldn't actually give up in the game if you lose every run KEKW
[2023-01-01 21:24:07] <@%SamuraiSavv> I've always told my friends to just play the map. Quests will get done when they get done.
[2023-01-01 21:24:13] <@%SamuraiSavv> And we survive most raids.
[2023-01-01 21:24:15] <renodemron> this is why speed run is not fun in this game

[2023-01-01 21:24:45] <+LegolasX1234> Aside from audio bugs and streets running poorly I'm really enjoying this wipe
[2023-01-01 21:24:51] <+GILBZ09> @SamuraiSavv Questing gives so much more XP though, slow's down progress if you're not questing, especially if you're not a 8 hr a day player

[2023-01-01 21:32:42] <@%Ripper203> @holyfrenzyoffline It's rarer in this but when you do get VOIP interactions they are quite unique. I find Scav to be more VOIP heavy

[2023-01-01 23:02:18] <de_charny> I would like to see the value of loot behind locked rooms be "dynamic" based off of demand. start of wipe X% of locked rooms have high tier loot. as those rooms get looted they go to mid tier and then low tier. the initially low tier locked rooms become higher value if the demand for them is low. this way there is a cycle of which rooms & keys are valuable based off of player demand.
[2023-01-01 23:02:20] <@%Mrshilka> thats because their bloodline is weak @ForsaikenRedskye NODDERS

[2023-01-01 23:13:26] <+Prexal> @jAmzye thats cause they added a whole new map?
[2023-01-01 23:13:35] <SomaVision> A lot of these things could be decent skill options. Instead of allowing people to make 6 ft vertical leaps. Allow for these types of things
[2023-01-01 23:13:35] <+graydaemon> @jAmzye why would they release a new map then

[2023-01-01 23:51:51] <@%^Nightbot> Okay Klean, that's the last straw, you always complain about people cheesing skills and running meta gear and now you're promoting going into raid with nothing and waiting at Scav Lands all raid for a Scav, like, that's how the game is supposed to be played? Okay bro, have fun being a hypocrite.
