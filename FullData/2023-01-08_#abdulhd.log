If you are not a subscriber and have a Twitch Turbo you won't see any ads on any twitch channel and still count into ad revenue for the streamer! So imagine how much you can support your favorite streamer just by having Turbo!! twitch.tv/turbo

[2023-01-08 16:25:28] <@%^StreamElements> @Bowladslol The Pipe is called Midwakh, and it is used to smoke Dokha. Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

[2023-01-08 17:10:20] <jbelux> @AbdulHD  alot of money in charity  is spend on salary of the ceo- peopele who run the ting and like 10-25% go to peopele who need help

[2023-01-08 17:12:16] <jbelux> @AbdulHD alot of money in charity is spend on salary of the ceo- peopele who run the ting and like 10-25% go to peopele who need help
[2023-01-08 17:12:19] <+Discombe> True
[2023-01-08 17:12:25] <%NumarkHD> jokers really
[2023-01-08 17:12:26] <+Seetherrr> Like if a charity can raise $1m with no marketing, but if they spend $1m on marketing they raise $10m that's potentially a lot more money going to the people that need it.  Just different ways to look at it.
[2023-01-08 17:12:30] <hardcorelvl> exactly
[2023-01-08 17:12:39] <+bladetricks> a lot of people that run charities get an executive wage lol

[2023-01-08 17:13:26] <SmokinSoda> @Seetherrr no, bc they get tax refund and fuck the taxpayer
[2023-01-08 17:13:29] <trollfriendly> Like I know money creates greed right but where do we stop? People know no bounds for the greed of money that will see there OWN family for $100k

[2023-01-08 17:13:34] <+Seetherrr> Definitely a ton of shady charities though that are just meant to enrich the people at the top
[2023-01-08 17:13:36] <%IamGoco> @bladetricks It's simple, they wouldn't get a CEO/CFO type leader with experience if they were not paying the CEO wage.

[2023-01-08 17:14:29] <%+Cruzito_1987> let's not keep putting a negative connotation on charities because there are positive ones it there

[2023-01-08 17:14:48] <trollfriendly> I'm poor asf I would be just happy with owing my own house lol Theae idiots have money for 50+houses and still not happy
[2023-01-08 17:14:51] <hardcorelvl> I don't get that you have money that can potentially set you for life but you still go hustle for more by scamming people of the little they have

Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

[2023-01-08 18:57:55] <@%^StreamElements> @communication101 The Pipe is called Midwakh, and it is used to smoke Dokha. Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

[2023-01-08 21:30:52] <@%^StreamElements> @stander2400 with Twitch Turbo you can support your favorite streamer even if you're not subscribed to them!! If you are not a subscriber and have a Twitch Turbo you won't see any ads on any twitch channel and still count into ad revenue for the streamer! So imagine how much you can support your favorite streamer just by having Turbo!! twitch.tv/turbo
