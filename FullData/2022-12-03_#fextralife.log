[2022-12-03 03:42:07] <NomadicBe> 3/5 is pretty bad for a  AAA game at $60+.
[2022-12-03 03:42:20] <dovakiinthegreat> the boss battles are about being perfect and getting one tapped

[2022-12-03 14:18:52] <TheEnhas> It's more like Chimera Squad than XCOM 2 and it's still much different than even that
