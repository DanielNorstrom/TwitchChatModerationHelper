[2022-12-08 16:40:49] <+kdlutz> Would highly recommend sery_bot if you're worried about that type of thing. It's been amazing for the streams i mod for
[2022-12-08 16:40:57] <QerQa_> i do that as well, i talk first and catch a vibe and maybe follow after
[2022-12-08 16:41:00] <%$Teeel1> worse is the ones with a follow for x minutes before chatting
[2022-12-08 16:41:02] <Crimzan4> LUL Yeah no offense HAHA
