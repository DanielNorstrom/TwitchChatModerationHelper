[2023-01-03 16:38:58] <+Fromac40n9> being born near the equator doesnt affect you growing up?
[2023-01-03 16:39:03] <%BrokenWeeble> "work less earn more" sounds better LUL
[2023-01-03 16:39:09] <%+Cwarner312> they are ambiguous traits that most ppl can identify with
[2023-01-03 16:39:09] <luckypuki1> something is happening though you just don't know enough about it and who to take it from because there is too many people who aproach it as frauds

[2023-01-03 16:39:24] <luckypuki1> approach
[2023-01-03 16:39:25] <Tobin> so the question is how long would you "go with it" if things got further

[2023-01-03 16:46:58] <Pissfoot> my father is a physics doctor, he was into astrology and did it seriously for 2 years, enough time for him to realise it was bunch of horseshit. There were always several ways to interpret the signs .. like "ooh according to Venus position he will have a great day but according to Mercury he is gonna break a leg"
[2023-01-03 16:47:00] <Zardak123> @manu23318 alchemy is just historic chemistry

[2023-01-03 18:19:58] <@%$heavymetalrules> if they were hot
[2023-01-03 18:20:06] <errantchaos> Think of it this way. Vampires are predators. So they need to be good looking to attract their prey. Then there is they way they drain blood. A bite to the neck. This is generally an intimate act, so a lot vampire lore leans into this and vampires become sexy.
[2023-01-03 18:20:07] <+GGsMostly> i thought you were saying hooves and tail is a no on sex for you

[2023-01-03 18:42:47] <Kupru91> I know also people who do not like modern movies. They find irritating that the plot comes so sudden and unexpected, even though hints have been there all the time. They feel that they have been fooled
