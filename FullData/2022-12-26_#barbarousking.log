[2022-12-26 00:00:15] <%$corignis> maybe Bilbo's voluntary separation from the ring actually severed its connection to him unlike Smeagol who just lost it?

[2022-12-26 00:54:54] <%Saxtirical> Do you think doom eternal has too much stuff to manage to the point where it detracts a bit from the fun? Alt fires, punch, belch, chainsaw, dash, sword, grenade etc.

[2022-12-26 14:53:01] <LBRJuxta> Rift Walkers is the worst squad in the game
[2022-12-26 14:53:05] <Neniuel> Just think this is normal difficult and still two higher, normal feels like most others hardest difficulty
[2022-12-26 14:53:06] <alicekhaajiit> ohhhh they added dlc?
[2022-12-26 14:53:11] <%vesipera> It scales the difficulty
[2022-12-26 14:53:12] <%manfred_bratwurst> they did add DLC
[2022-12-26 14:53:19] <%+RaDazio98> there is something ont the plane
[2022-12-26 14:53:19] <%Kroxin> Is that Barb?
[2022-12-26 14:53:22] <%wilky37> the added content DLC was like 6 months ago
[2022-12-26 14:53:26] <%spudbeaty> He said hold this timeline, is this some sort of time travel plot?
[2022-12-26 14:53:28] <%$azrael_dr> oof, defend the train is one of the tougher missions
[2022-12-26 14:53:31] <%SamuraiPoet88> @cjryzer Good Heckin Mornin Dood doodShake distH Hope you're well Amigo.
[2022-12-26 14:53:33] <%$trizgo> the islands do scale to the order you play them in
[2022-12-26 14:53:33] <%+bliek22112> you have an upgrade to give to the jet
[2022-12-26 14:53:35] <%$judithprietht> train missions are hard
[2022-12-26 14:53:35] <%vesipera> So if you do the 1st island last, it is more difficult
[2022-12-26 14:53:37] <%manfred_bratwurst> NODDERS
[2022-12-26 14:53:42] <Alfonso_Khan> that only means this is going to end really bad NODDERS
[2022-12-26 14:53:44] <%thejumpingmouse> Cool jet
[2022-12-26 14:53:46] <%+driveonparkways> the islands are more or less equal, gotta look at the enemy variety on each
[2022-12-26 14:53:50] <%numynu> train mission Madge
[2022-12-26 14:53:51] <%$cinemario> i got screwed so many times on the train missions
[2022-12-26 14:53:52] <%wilky37> @spudbeaty it's a reference to the fact that as a roguelike game, we repeatedly play different "runs"
[2022-12-26 14:53:53] <+regg202> @Kroxin I just got here and was thinking the same...even the glasses were the same
[2022-12-26 14:54:02] <eniak0km> do you plan to play Armored Core?

[2022-12-26 14:54:39] <%rabidwombat311> this is the Smoke Bomb squad
[2022-12-26 14:54:40] <%+CJRyzer> @samuraipoet88 I am doing better, had a bit of the sickness the last couple of days but feeling better. Hope you had a good holiday!
[2022-12-26 14:54:43] <Neniuel> Smoke is strong
[2022-12-26 14:54:45] <%vesipera> Smoke stops attacks
[2022-12-26 14:54:50] <%The_Edwardioe> This is my favorite set of units
[2022-12-26 14:54:53] <%+Bay82> that plane's attack is down thrust?
[2022-12-26 14:54:55] <%manfred_bratwurst> YEP
[2022-12-26 14:54:55] <%+bliek22112> smoke enemis can't attack its stronger than it look
[2022-12-26 14:54:57] <%+RaDazio98> yep
[2022-12-26 14:55:01] <%$cinemario> smoke prevents attacking all units
[2022-12-26 14:55:02] <+edited156> These are maybe my favorite squad.
[2022-12-26 14:55:03] <%thejumpingmouse> Smoke cancels attack, just like it does to you too

[2022-12-26 14:55:12] <%fall3nPhD> yeah smoke stops unit attacks
[2022-12-26 14:55:13] <%wilky37> @spudbeaty the game also allows you to "reuse" one pilot from the prior run (the guy in the jet plane here) so yeah they kinda do time travel
[2022-12-26 14:55:13] <%+cyeager332> I never attack when I smoke either
[2022-12-26 14:55:19] <%$trizgo> it's the heavy CC squad
[2022-12-26 14:55:22] <%$azrael_dr> and in this squad smoke also deals damage along with disabling them
[2022-12-26 14:55:22] <%+RaDazio98> this smoke squad is good
[2022-12-26 14:55:22] <Zombology> catJAM

[2022-12-26 15:22:44] <JonTanti> it's definitely easier than ftl, but it's hard to see where the snowball to lose starts from in this game sometimes

[2022-12-26 17:51:55] <%+26fury> cats kill too much animals outside

[2022-12-26 17:52:07] <%Eli_the_Argonian> yeah outdoor cats are a bad idea in general
[2022-12-26 17:52:07] <%+toughToes> @jimbobsandwich, makes sense
[2022-12-26 17:52:07] <%+WhiskeyWood> The shelter mad us sign  that we wouldn’t let my daughters cat out.
[2022-12-26 17:52:09] <%OneForTheMoney123> Barb you get any cool gifts?
[2022-12-26 17:52:11] <+edlike> Yeah cat’s should not be outside. I used to think different but there’s so many reasons to keep them safe and happy indoors
[2022-12-26 17:52:14] <%alucard835> outdoor cats live a lot less than indoor ones too
[2022-12-26 17:52:16] <%Mad_KatK> I've currently got an extra cat cause someone let their cat out into this damn blizzard so I am keeping it for now
[2022-12-26 17:52:22] <%+GaimeGuy> you can let cats outside when we restore the coyote and wolf populations
[2022-12-26 17:52:24] <%$snoops_kush> not when it's this cold
[2022-12-26 17:52:24] <$toymachinesh> good

[2022-12-26 17:52:28] <FingerlessTom> outdoor cars are pests are far as I'm concerned. I love my 2 cats but it's irresponsible for so many reasons to let them out
[2022-12-26 17:52:29] <%Joopelson> failsChokes
[2022-12-26 17:52:37] <%Exotic_Potato_> I would let my cats out but I live in Charlotte and everyone here drives like a maniac
[2022-12-26 17:52:39] <$toymachinesh> we have harnesses for the cats but they don't really like them
[2022-12-26 17:52:47] <$Tsuzuriko> Same here, not only is it dangerous for the cat as it can get sick or injured, but also an asshole thing to do as it can bring problems to other people. It's negligence
[2022-12-26 17:52:50] <Nameless_Nevermore> we built a Catio for them to go in and out of but no free roam
[2022-12-26 17:52:52] <%+kagenokurai> My cats can go in the garden, but we fenced them in

[2022-12-26 17:55:04] <%kacyraeclark> Thanks for being a constant in my life since my husband passed just over 2 years ago. I discovered your stream shortly after losing him and I can honestly say you’ve helped me continue to move forward. Also, we are birthday twins which makes us awesome. Merry all the things, Barb.
[2022-12-26 17:55:05] <%O_Luke> I'm allergic to cats, so a cat that's inside all the time is worse for my allergies.

[2022-12-26 18:40:07] <$jamwerd16> I don't go into a comic book movie NOT expecting comic book tropes.
[2022-12-26 18:40:08] <%zorkreturns> I can stomach the occasional lone superhero movie but whenever they bring multiple heroes into the same movie it just gets worse and worse.

[2022-12-26 18:40:13] <%Mr_Gowen> I loved the MCU, pretty much everything after Endgame has been disappointing to me.  I've accepted that it likely won't change.

[2022-12-26 18:40:15] <%Electrolith> I finally watched The Suicide Squad a couple nights ago. That was pretty fucking cool, especially for DC.

[2022-12-26 18:40:25] <Adagiotal> Dennis Villeneuve can fuck off too
[2022-12-26 18:40:28] <%Surreal3k> Hollywood is risk adverse. Marvel prints money so you'll keep getting those movies for a while.

[2022-12-26 18:49:58] <%Missing_Node> The series isn't to tell more Addams Family stories. It's to get millennial white women who identify with Wednesday to tune in.

[2022-12-26 19:02:14] <%boozie703> :)
[2022-12-26 19:02:18] <+Metro2003> hi Barb, why kill first goomba?
[2022-12-26 19:02:18] <%samuraichameleon> people don't seem to like weir's second book artemis, but i found it pretty enjoyable too
[2022-12-26 19:02:20] <%Jomo7> Artemis by Weir is kind of a turd.  But Hail Mary was solid
[2022-12-26 19:02:27] <%$nycvega> i agree the levels really come into their own the deeper into the hack you get NODDERS
[2022-12-26 19:02:37] <%ropeaderp> project hail mary
[2022-12-26 19:02:43] <%$mordborne> @Zaiz_En the first half of that movie is great and then kinda falls apart
[2022-12-26 19:02:49] <%tuxedocat0> Project Hail Mary?
[2022-12-26 19:02:53] <%tuxedocat0> it's a lot of fun

[2022-12-26 19:03:08] <%Nymh79> Yeah. Project Hail Mary was fun.
[2022-12-26 19:03:11] <%boozie703> This is the shell hack that will revolutionize all future shell hack making.

[2022-12-26 19:09:29] <%$DarkSlash88> @devetr I've played a lot of the other ones, and my community hyped me up for it. I found the story all over the place, and most of the systems tedious and not well implemented. Overall felt like a lot of interesting ideas that weren't fleshed out well enough.

[2022-12-26 19:58:44] <%+MarMar0326> @devetr I would say if you have a PC, no. All Xbox games come out on PC. I like having one so I can game in my living room, while my PC is in my office. But thats my situation.
