[2023-01-08 22:53:39] <@%xsolus> when i go back to sleep again after my main sleep i remember my dream a lot more often after that
[2023-01-08 22:53:42] <Rustedstring> The worst nightmares happen during naps...
[2023-01-08 22:53:50] <@%achievementguy> @xsolus yeah same
[2023-01-08 22:53:51] <gorillafinn> so true
[2023-01-08 22:53:52] <%hectop4scal> that is something I've experienced, I had a really bad insomnia period a few years ago where I would only be able to sleep like maybe 2 hours at a time, dreamt a lot more than usual
[2023-01-08 22:53:57] <cockablaze> life is a night mare!!!!! !
[2023-01-08 22:54:03] <!%$bobobubug> just lay down on your back if you want a lucid dream :) since i think it is triggered by something on the back idfk i remember reading that tho

[2023-01-08 22:54:46] <@%achievementguy> @bobobubug that is also true, sleeping on the back does make you dream more I think

[2023-01-08 22:56:57] <%bitelemons> i can read i think
[2023-01-08 22:57:07] <!%$bobobubug> maybe its visualization ability (ego)
