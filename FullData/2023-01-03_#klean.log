[2023-01-03 00:15:37] <+Hardie1247> Klean, how would you feel about them changing the way invisible scav snipers work, so that they fire a warning shot closeby, then speak over a loudspeaker for say 5-10 seconds, if you dont leave after their warning message, they fire a fatal shot?
[2023-01-03 00:15:45] <The_Murz> @Klean why do you do the money spread out like that instead of a wallet?

[2023-01-03 00:33:43] <+OlBoyGoose> @nevcogold Just spoke to Veritas in Tweaks chat and he's doing testing....he says that Binaural doesn't work period, so leave it off to avoid performance issues. But sound overall is in the worst state it's ever been

[2023-01-03 00:34:04] <+Zezzku> revoltsin It also might need a proper lenght barrel, I know some of the handguards conflict due to barrel lenght

[2023-01-03 00:34:30] <+Zezzku> They will say it fits in the gun but thats because it fits the receiver and not the barrel

[2023-01-03 01:12:05] <%+stuntedsights> Bc2 is in my top fav games
[2023-01-03 01:12:08] <%BSDilly> Only thing I’ve noticed on battlebit is there is a lot of sweating with people jumping around corners and flying around the place, movement can get a bit whacky
[2023-01-03 01:12:10] <%+kevsabot> I miss BF BC2 and Vietnam, was such a vibe. Single player was so fun too
[2023-01-03 01:12:10] <%KyleIronheart> You and Drewski
[2023-01-03 01:12:13] <%KrackinWise313> Another great thing about battlebit the devs are actually making sure it isnt broken before it releases
[2023-01-03 01:12:14] <prozak995> I still play anomaly because of you
[2023-01-03 01:12:15] <%iLuminaye> sadly got delayed till december 2023
[2023-01-03 01:12:15] <+flipflapweenrslap> I miss the Bad Company 2 Vietnam expansion that shit was amazing

[2023-01-03 01:13:02] <%RollerMobbed> @klean I found out about anomaly because of you, it was good to find out about it because I was still playing Last day mod
[2023-01-03 01:13:02] <pushbackbetter> shame
[2023-01-03 01:13:03] <%Coach_Duke> Stalker streams were such a vibe
[2023-01-03 01:13:09] <+Alecgator17> battlebit does look very fun, honestly after all the games Ive ever played, gameplay is FAR more important

[2023-01-03 01:13:35] <prozak995> @Klean will you be streaming Stalker 2 when it releases?
[2023-01-03 01:13:54] <%Coach_Duke> No offense to the tarkov audience, but the Stalker chat was one of the best vibes here ^^

[2023-01-03 01:24:36] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean is it a webcam? if so check if auto exposure is on, set it to a manual lower value. If it's DSLR/mirrorless camera, check shutterspeed / shoot mode? or could be overheat.
[2023-01-03 01:24:45] <%+Guzaus> I had an issue with auto exposure on my cam, it would lower the framerate when it raised exposure

[2023-01-03 01:26:02] <@%SpottedTango> it wouldn't be iso change, it would be shutterspeed that would cause that. Auto settings could be turning down the shutterspeed to keep iso low.

[2023-01-03 01:39:07] <+Ulceredegenoux> @TSvassilev it would also add opportunity as a scav sometime fighting against other scav... if they are against your gang
[2023-01-03 01:39:27] <%+aamef> @TSvassilev Or like what if scavs could "agree" to fight? Like western duel/fast draw stuff. Basically if you both want some loot, you can fight over it without the risk of penalty LUL

[2023-01-03 01:39:44] <TSvassilev> @Ulceredegenoux there was a great suggestion here yesterday - scav should be random map. I would add that scavs should have an opportunity to camp PMC extracts and exfil themselves
[2023-01-03 01:39:44] <+Ulceredegenoux> warzone can fuck up people so it can surely create violent civil gangs

[2023-01-03 01:41:07] <TSvassilev> @Ulceredegenoux scav are literally yelling "get out of here, this is our spot". a gang should be able to take control of a region
[2023-01-03 01:41:52] <+Ulceredegenoux> @TSvassilev this could be interesting in the future IF tarkov become open world. adding event where scav gangs or pmcs gang old a fort or a spot
[2023-01-03 01:41:54] <TSvassilev> @Ulceredegenoux streamers already organize those, but better match making would be nice

[2023-01-03 01:43:51] <BattleriteBestGame> woods scav is great for village with v exit, tons of loot there
[2023-01-03 01:43:57] <%+KARMERICAN> that feeling though of scavving back into the raid you died on would be gone tho :(
[2023-01-03 01:44:01] <+carnage424> shoreline is my least favorite map, its way to slow imo
[2023-01-03 01:44:02] <razzmatazzer> I scav shoreline for hidden caches you sir need to keep these thoughts to yourself

[2023-01-03 01:44:12] <%SabolToothTiger> and it would help with scav killing quests
[2023-01-03 01:44:25] <+Ulceredegenoux> is someone in tarkov have done an entire wipe only doing scav runs? like not using pmc at all? i dont know if any content creator have done that yet

[2023-01-03 01:50:24] <tsiigaaja> Low karma scavs should look different from high karma scavs

[2023-01-03 01:51:05] <bajadaniel> I do love Klean the goofy guy hes always talking about something interesting
[2023-01-03 01:51:10] <%+GL0CKenspeil> my issues with the scavs is that they do things that no player could do
[2023-01-03 01:51:16] <TSvassilev> tarkov scavs watch as you bleed and cough blood
[2023-01-03 01:51:19] <+carnage424> like hunt showdowns aiming,
[2023-01-03 01:51:23] <tsiigaaja> Like your character in the loading screen
[2023-01-03 01:51:31] <%holyfrenzyoffline> thats y i like dayz system for it
[2023-01-03 01:51:35] <SevenTruths> High and Low ready would nice
[2023-01-03 01:51:39] <%+dizzyhippydrake> having a weapin readied shoudl SLOWLY take stam
[2023-01-03 01:51:40] <TSvassilev> everyone pointing a gun in your face when they look at you @Klean
[2023-01-03 01:51:40] <pablolaflame1> Im surpised they havent added it
[2023-01-03 01:51:46] <%Draco_BT> strength too. Can't hold a weapon at aim all the time
[2023-01-03 01:51:49] <coke212> yes low ready and point shoot like dayz @Klean
[2023-01-03 01:51:49] <%dksan1211> @Klean  I see you dont have eftsettings with dlss, I just bought new pc with 3070 dont know what settings dlss on or off
[2023-01-03 01:51:57] <%DespiseTheirLies> kleanSip
[2023-01-03 01:52:13] <tsiigaaja> It's hard to make realistic weapon sway without it feeling like shit in game
[2023-01-03 01:52:21] <+HotelTwoFive> I agree with you, but do you think they can do this without making it feel clunky?
[2023-01-03 01:52:28] <theredwings13> even COD has those mechanics lol
[2023-01-03 01:52:34] <%Draco_BT> Right!
[2023-01-03 01:52:37] <%dksan1211> @Klean  bilinear audio off?
[2023-01-03 01:52:39] VIEWERS: 1 962
[2023-01-03 01:52:41] <+Robbeh27> instead of adding stuff maybe they should fix desync audio and optimize the maps alot better. we got a gym though which is amazing.....
[2023-01-03 01:52:47] <%+dizzyhippydrake> yah that would help immersion alot
[2023-01-03 01:52:52] <%holyfrenzyoffline> and it slows u too
[2023-01-03 01:53:00] <Kdragsnes> Would be cool to have low and high ready
[2023-01-03 01:53:10] <TSvassilev> @Robbeh27 why not both? @Robbeh27
[2023-01-03 01:53:18] <%dksan1211> @Klean  dlss ? have 3070 nvidia first time duno settings you have old settings
[2023-01-03 01:53:19] <psyxopathis_69> also will be cool if they add scavs or bosses that are moving from one side to the other side of the map
[2023-01-03 01:53:24] <KennySWISS> mosin with 0 ergo would be brutal to use
[2023-01-03 01:53:26] <%Draco_BT> rest weapons on ledges
[2023-01-03 01:53:33] <%+daryl52> 100% and lower movement speed
[2023-01-03 01:53:45] <bajadaniel> if they removed i doubt its coming back
[2023-01-03 01:53:46] <LionheArtPC> I think they removed because of hatchlings
[2023-01-03 01:53:47] <+Robbeh27> because they obviously struggle to do both audio is worse than 3 wipes ago lol
[2023-01-03 01:53:51] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @Robbeh27 theres multiple teams working on multiple projects though too
[2023-01-03 01:54:00] <prozak995> @Draco_BT Iv been waiting for this for so long

[2023-01-03 01:54:55] <+Robbeh27> regarding audio
[2023-01-03 01:54:57] <LionheArtPC> but they should add bashing to counter that I guess
[2023-01-03 01:54:59] <JamesonBlunts> those fights were soooo fun
[2023-01-03 01:55:03] <%dksan1211> @Klean dlss ? have 3070 nvidia first time duno settings you have old settings
[2023-01-03 01:55:12] <molignol> i agree
[2023-01-03 01:55:29] <%holyfrenzyoffline> or u could run smg to counter that i think that would make smgs run more
[2023-01-03 01:55:34] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @Robbeh27 because they switched to a whole new system. it does suck ass tho

[2023-01-03 01:56:39] <@%SpottedTango> it's the old dlss 2 method, not the new shiny 2.5

[2023-01-03 01:58:51] <%KevinSredz> it would also make running suppressors even more risky in CQB because it extends your weapon length
[2023-01-03 01:58:58] <%KevinSredz> more pros n cons
[2023-01-03 01:59:27] <TSvassilev> @KevinSredz suppressors are OP now imho

[2023-01-03 02:11:40] <salle_> I just have seen your stream and wanted to say that I thought you were super adorable. you don’t know me at all and i know it’s kinda weird. I just thought maybe it’d be fun to roleplay with you as your online gf maybe? I know you’re straight. I’m a boy that’s why I was saying roleplay.. this isn’t a troll. again, I know it’s really random and weird. I’m sorry. It would just be a fun online relationship - nothing serious and I could donate to you and your stream and support you

[2023-01-03 02:30:51] <razzmatazzer> because anyone can just mag dump and pay zero attention to the shots. Actually putting rounds on target means your learning

[2023-01-03 02:31:36] <%KrackinWise313> @KevinSredz Its from being tired from pumpin iron in the gym PepeLaugh
[2023-01-03 02:31:38] <+Devil_Ferret> io gotta admit, it's because of you that i mostly run semi auto because of your thoughts on it, other than the occasional rip of full auto at close quarters

[2023-01-03 02:32:04] <TSvassilev> @razzmatazzer and you should be able to master guns and recoil in the hideout, but here we are @razzmatazzer
[2023-01-03 02:32:11] <+yowch1> thinking i'm gonna get a sennheiser, anything to say about your setup?

[2023-01-03 02:32:22] <+mall_rats> @Devil_Ferret Same here, its the best way to play imo
[2023-01-03 02:32:22] <NatsuoYumi> would be nice if u could repair ur weapon personally with little trade offs, like for example ur a bear and can repair russian weapons better cuz of the faction and knowledge u would maybe have but you would be worse at repairing the american weapons
[2023-01-03 02:32:53] <1batlchip> gtg take care and hope you have a great stream @klean
[2023-01-03 02:32:57] <razzmatazzer> I mean yeah that makes sense and it's not far fetched either. Introduce a mini game similar to how the gym works and make it actually cost ammo

[2023-01-03 02:34:30] <renodemron> no the 25

[2023-01-03 02:34:45] <%KrackinWise313> yeah I think 25's are the meta

[2023-01-03 02:35:00] <prozak995> na 25 does less damage and has more recoil
[2023-01-03 02:35:06] <woke__smeed> it is shrap 10
[2023-01-03 02:35:13] <renodemron> buy dw u shoot on the leg anyway KEKW
[2023-01-03 02:35:26] <prozak995> yea 25 is faster
[2023-01-03 02:35:35] <renodemron> Yep
[2023-01-03 02:35:49] <The_Murz> That's 100% a Kentucky Ballistics gun. seqKEK
[2023-01-03 02:35:50] <TheL0neGunmen> You still gotta aim real high with that gun?

[2023-01-03 02:35:57] <ThePrumos> 153 shotty with flechettes are my goto for early wipe since 4 wipes. so much dmg and shreds every armor in a few shots

[2023-01-03 02:50:02] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean WHY then does BSG justify not allowing viewmodel FOV change? model consistancy?
[2023-01-03 02:50:10] <Tehnk> @Klean does the shattering on the screen with that helmet match per round hit?

[2023-01-03 02:54:52] <+Devil_Ferret> lower FOV also lowers the visible recoil on any scoped weapon, whereas a higher FOV lowers visible recoil on any weapon with a reflex optic like an EOTECH or Aimpoint
[2023-01-03 02:54:53] <%veryrarejosh> it looks so much better with the pistol

[2023-01-03 02:55:06] <Altoption> They just need to separate the viewmodel fov from the world fov and then even the sights won't be too small on some guns, I don't see any problems with it other than that monkaHmm

[2023-01-03 02:56:21] <sharpshootn> yee
[2023-01-03 02:56:29] <%KrackinWise313> You should have the option to change it imo
[2023-01-03 02:56:29] <Pendy131> If you aim at your feet and do that trick it looks like low ready.
[2023-01-03 02:56:29] <MattonixTV> this needs to be what it looks like normally
[2023-01-03 02:56:41] <+food726> yo
[2023-01-03 02:56:43] <%HJinks> what if after you blind fire you try to free look and then use tab while pressing the aim button?
[2023-01-03 02:56:46] <Altoption> @Jurgenaut2 Will be like the freelooking, so scopes will look pretty small unfortunately
[2023-01-03 02:56:48] <%HJinks> same result?
[2023-01-03 02:56:50] <+SIUL8R_> Keep doing the same. It bugs out the entire viewmodel. Do it a couple more times KEKW
[2023-01-03 02:56:52] <Secondthefirst> thats should be awesome with some of those guns that cover half of your screen
[2023-01-03 02:56:55] <%veryrarejosh> bsg said they'll never include that in the game, or just that they think it looks like shit?

[2023-01-03 02:58:08] <%LegitBanana_> Nikita pls
[2023-01-03 02:58:09] <@%SpottedTango> omg. proper aiming
[2023-01-03 02:58:15] <suomij> You can also evade shots by locking your characters head down but you can see forward

[2023-01-03 02:58:27] <tsiigaaja> @Klean I like the aesthetic but aiming can be a bit harder with some irons

[2023-01-03 02:58:32] <@%SpottedTango> Think about what? No idea what you're talking about Kapp
[2023-01-03 02:58:36] <%Kuez> @justcarbunkle When ADSing the FOV doesn't change.
[2023-01-03 02:58:38] <%holyfrenzyoffline> now do it with a long scope

[2023-01-03 02:59:20] <%KrackinWise313> it should be an option for sure
[2023-01-03 02:59:20] <trapys> Options are always a positive
[2023-01-03 02:59:29] <+Matraxxs> Some games have that option now
[2023-01-03 02:59:39] <%+Driskey_> when I ADS in RL though my FOV zooms... sike
[2023-01-03 02:59:43] <Altoption> The viewmodels would need to be changed tho, since scopes and sights are too small like this, or a lazy fix would be to only zoom it in with more than 1x scopes
[2023-01-03 02:59:46] <suomij> You can also pop your head down but you can see forward
[2023-01-03 03:00:07] <%+cykaq49> @Matraxxs it should honestly be just be for everyone, no options

[2023-01-03 03:12:12] <1wilsonn> anyone know how to get rid of really laggy menu? my game runs smooth ingame but menu lags out for like 30secs at a time
[2023-01-03 03:12:16] <ThePrumos> @yaojin312022 people are just playing more than you LUL klean is lvl 26
[2023-01-03 03:12:27] <GilLavender> i just tried that and if you look like all the way left while free looking and then hit tab you can see your shoulder

[2023-01-03 03:12:37] <%LegitBanana_> I can see my shoulder while holding a rifle high ready irl so it seems realistic to me

[2023-01-03 03:13:12] <%ColeChiIls> @Ragedend Look into the Sig, aero, and other common AR10s. Alot of them are cheaper and lighter then the MDR
[2023-01-03 03:13:17] <@%SpottedTango> What about the based HCAR?
[2023-01-03 03:13:19] <ThePrumos> @yaojin312022 was he farming raiders ?
[2023-01-03 03:13:29] <Ragedend> and i've heard desert tech puts a sick trigger in it stock.

[2023-01-03 03:43:11] <@%SpottedTango> no idea if windows 11 might also have a performance it, I have no idea, but it wouldn't surprise me.
[2023-01-03 03:43:11] <HayblinkinTV> Anyone have a good map to scav on that qont take 30min que?

[2023-01-03 03:43:24] <%+aamef> Found armor repair kit on my scav, should my pulse be high trying to extract or are they common/easy to get? LUL

[2023-01-03 03:43:43] <trapys> @FrostyyTheSnowThug on my 3600 it gave me like 2fps or so, but that might have been placebo aswell

[2023-01-03 03:43:59] <ThePrumos> @HayblinkinTV switch servers from auto to every server below 100 ping. should fix long que times
[2023-01-03 03:43:59] <tsiigaaja> @aamef Not common, you wanna survive with that. Cheap ass armor repairs. Need lavatory lvl 1 or 2 though I think to use it
[2023-01-03 03:43:59] <+BootyGrabBro> After a 15 minute wait for street scav the lag was horrendous. customs pmc was butter
[2023-01-03 03:44:07] <%ColeChiIls> Wtf is the Veritas Mordhau incident
[2023-01-03 03:44:27] <%+apuhlii> i am wondering also @ColeChiIls

[2023-01-03 03:44:35] <sweatyswampsoldier> @HayblinkinTV Factory is fastest for building scav rep, just run straight to extract. Reserve is best for scav loot, but dangerous.  And Woods is a bit slower to queue but is considerably safer than most other maps.

[2023-01-03 03:58:18] <beanmann35> some games have affected or independant fov

[2023-01-03 03:58:37] <trapys> the camera recoil reduction makes me worried....

[2023-01-03 03:58:51] <beanmann35> so freelook + inventory?
[2023-01-03 03:58:52] <allb3ast> So you play at 50 fov you said
[2023-01-03 03:58:57] <allb3ast> Or in the middle
[2023-01-03 03:59:00] <suomij> Try it with the new smg
[2023-01-03 03:59:04] <@%SpottedTango> @Boub0ule my guess is he actively doesn't want people to be able to do this.

[2023-01-03 03:59:28] <%Boub0ule> @SpottedTango yeah true, but as klean said it's kinda more realistic ya know
[2023-01-03 03:59:30] <%+MTReese_> @beanmann35 freelook, find the center of your screen, then tab

[2023-01-03 04:00:07] <beanmann35> it feels more realistic honestly
[2023-01-03 04:00:11] <Altoption> @trapys The reduction just comes with the higher fov, happens in every fps in which you can alter the ads fov
[2023-01-03 04:00:15] <%potatosacman> Way more natural
[2023-01-03 04:00:15] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean lower FOV = closer to screen - aka FOV is decreasing, not increasing!
[2023-01-03 04:00:16] <+AlekH34> he’s a bills player & he dropped limb on the field in mnf and got cpr and was taken off the field from an ambulance.. wasn’t breathing on his own. so sad

[2023-01-03 04:21:46] <%BSDilly> @siddo__ He 100% lost the legs, that snow plow on his insta is a beast
[2023-01-03 04:22:11] <%potatosacman> It’s such a game changer and so simple too
[2023-01-03 04:22:16] <tsiigaaja> In my game prototype its like this but you can toggle with ALT
[2023-01-03 04:22:24] <tsiigaaja> Lol literally what you just said
[2023-01-03 04:22:34] <%+bobbyboosef> What setting is Klean talking about?
[2023-01-03 04:22:38] <%ocelot536> i just killed a pmc on woods as a scav with the 1 shot 762x54 rifle with that FOV thing lol
[2023-01-03 04:22:51] <%SupraVT> something like dayz zoom?
[2023-01-03 04:23:00] <allb3ast> That’s why you see people aim in and look down to see closer basically
[2023-01-03 04:23:02] <@%SpottedTango> just like dayz
[2023-01-03 04:23:02] <tsiigaaja> @bobbyboosef Theres this way to press Tab while free looking to lock the FOV to  a high FOV when aiming

[2023-01-03 04:39:39] <+snowcrackerz> how do you change that?
[2023-01-03 04:39:44] <Toons11> and it is still teh same recoil etc it just looks less

[2023-01-03 04:40:19] <%+KARMERICAN> @Klean can you show Fov glitch + 60fov on the LPVO again?
[2023-01-03 04:40:28] <+Weirell> @Klean have you told Sacriel42 about this 'feature'?

[2023-01-03 04:40:42] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean you keep saying "Increase FOV" when you mean Decrease FOV, you wanna do another take or should I clip that?
[2023-01-03 04:40:43] <%+Dejnio> @Klean Can you forward that idea to Nikita? Maybe he will implement this feature down the line. It would be pretty sick.

[2023-01-03 04:41:24] <+Jawln> Have you had the strange glitch where hitting bushes does not make noise or is it just me?

[2023-01-03 04:41:51] <siddo__> @Klean do you think tarkov would ever add click on nightvision for scopes?
[2023-01-03 04:41:52] <%+oATLANTICo> How long will the glitch stay
[2023-01-03 04:41:58] <%+TheVixx> yea, would be nice for it to default to no squint, and then have a squint button
[2023-01-03 04:42:02] <suomij> I use it to snipe, it helps you look around without being  adsd
[2023-01-03 04:42:04] <+ValiantScar> its ADS fov, like they have in battlfield

[2023-01-03 04:52:27] <siddo__> i woudl personally like a middle ground, just a small decrease in FOV like you are sligthly leaning forward to ADS
[2023-01-03 04:52:27] <%SupraVT> kinda like how extensive gamma's gun/fov
[2023-01-03 04:52:28] <%BSDilly> If you made a video explaining your slower playstyle in abit more detail i'd say it would pop, its a very likeable playstyle and not one many even think is possible

[2023-01-03 04:52:55] <+EpochZ_Grahame> It's either they remove it or most people have to use it or be at a disadvantage ofc
[2023-01-03 04:53:02] <real_evin> lotta other games have the option to control the FOV change when ADSing
[2023-01-03 04:53:06] <Respect_> if there's a cheek weld, maybe that justifies it as a design decision but for point shooting seems odd to force.

[2023-01-03 04:53:50] <%+TheVixx> Can you do it @ 63 FoV since most folks are on that one?
[2023-01-03 04:53:55] <%ColeChiIls> @Klean show like a pistol, rifle, and scoped dmr
[2023-01-03 04:53:59] <siddo__> @Respect_ yeah i think the fov decreasing sligthly like leaning forwards makes sense, but in tarkov he basically inhales the gun especially with zoomed optics
[2023-01-03 04:53:59] <Toons11> having the sniper scope and a pistol are really good to show
[2023-01-03 04:54:02] <Toons11> yee

[2023-01-03 04:57:56] <%fig__jam> @CHADIVORE Just free look again
[2023-01-03 04:58:24] <CHADIVORE> not to sound like a dick, but you mean FOV decreases, right?
[2023-01-03 04:58:35] <%ColeChiIls> @Klean LUL leave the recoil part out. Thatll def get it fixed asap
[2023-01-03 04:58:36] <%LegitBanana_> yes
[2023-01-03 04:58:41] <Matt_isBeast> yep, thats what he means lol
[2023-01-03 04:58:45] <+Zezzku> CHADIVORE Yes he mean decreases
[2023-01-03 04:58:45] <%+mahhndo> Jeesus that looks 10x better
[2023-01-03 04:58:56] <siddo__> @ColeChiIls it doesnt decrease recoil tho, just makes it looks less annoying
[2023-01-03 04:59:00] <%MrGreyv> It's increase in Kleanenese
[2023-01-03 04:59:05] <MoonRoccs> this spot on, it feels like the PMC puts his eye on the scope all the time
[2023-01-03 04:59:06] <%+mahhndo> I love how Ready or Not made ADS , seeing that in tarkov would be absolutely Pog
[2023-01-03 04:59:26] <%Nasty_Nate91> @mahhndo RON ads is great

[2023-01-03 04:59:31] <CHADIVORE> Yeah that makes reticles sharper
[2023-01-03 04:59:39] <%ColeChiIls> @siddo__ I know. Doesnt matter tho as it is an advantage. COD had a huge debate about this a while back
[2023-01-03 04:59:52] <SdStance> so is this kind of a glitch or intentional for the game?
[2023-01-03 04:59:57] <%+Bows0108> im stoked to have options
[2023-01-03 04:59:57] <%ColeChiIls> @siddo__ wider fov, less camera recoil both let you track better
[2023-01-03 04:59:59] <Tnrdle> willerAltynFeller
[2023-01-03 05:00:03] <+Xyclonius> Thats actually much better for me than the way they have it
[2023-01-03 05:00:03] <CHADIVORE> it's a glitch
[2023-01-03 05:00:16] <%BSDilly> Class

[2023-01-03 05:00:18] <for3xx> o wow
[2023-01-03 05:00:20] <matjeli> they should just change the FOV to what you are displaying here, it looks so much more natural
[2023-01-03 05:00:25] <SdStance> man i wish it wasnt a glitch that looks so much better

[2023-01-03 05:04:02] <+Magnius_HC> @Klean Yo, did BSG fix the fragmentation bug if the ammo had under 17 pen? It seems like alot of the pen chances and frag chances were changed.

[2023-01-03 05:05:57] <+AgyntSmyth> The point to make to win over BSG is this is realistic.  Zoomed in ADS is like closing one eye, not zoomed in is like proper both eyes open shooting and the proper way to use optics and even mechanical sights.
[2023-01-03 05:06:07] <@%SpottedTango> i didn't know about the upload though, that's nice

[2023-01-03 05:28:39] <%+bigassbeaver69> to do the dehydration quest i should just use painkillers right?
[2023-01-03 05:28:49] <%Nasty_Nate91> @bigassbeaver69 mayo works really well
[2023-01-03 05:29:05] <%+moosE3knucklE> i spent 5 mins searching each bag to get to then end and see nothing hahaha i was like bruh
[2023-01-03 05:29:08] <%Dragonlord54> @bigassbeaver69 chuck a jar of mayo works better
[2023-01-03 05:29:14] <%+bigassbeaver69> @bigassbeaver69 no mayo kleanRIP
[2023-01-03 05:29:20] <%+aamef> @bigassbeaver69 I couldn't find mayo so I just did some painkillers at the end of the raid when my hydration was a low %% worked nice
[2023-01-03 05:29:20] <%Dragonlord54> and then pop a propital to negate the damage

[2023-01-03 06:08:28] <%Suspicious_Potatoes> I really like how it doesn't change your normal fov. I wish more games did that, especially in tactical fps games
[2023-01-03 06:08:48] <BeinionOnTwitch> hey guys
[2023-01-03 06:09:41] <velhottaja> Yeah, this should actually be a real feature you could change or toggle in game

[2023-01-03 06:10:18] <ReindeerPolice> Oh ok cool, I thought someone in chat mentioned it. It’s so good! @spottedtango
[2023-01-03 06:10:19] <+deltagoatactual> yeah like ads+whatever key drops your fov back
[2023-01-03 06:10:36] <+deltagoatactual> if it's realism they want you can 100% do that irl
[2023-01-03 06:10:36] <%+DraX_Core> just finished watching the new video. that is really nice i do wish I could turn off the fov zoom

[2023-01-03 06:12:38] <Altoption> That gives me some hope they might actually implement this Pog
[2023-01-03 06:12:47] <pablolaflame1> would love to see the Bren in this game

[2023-01-03 06:12:59] <%Miltop1G> @brentonbazz or add dayZ like hold breath system
[2023-01-03 06:13:00] <+AntoniusJD> @Altoption why would it give you hope? they removed it last time
[2023-01-03 06:13:13] <brentonbazz> @Miltop1G yeah that would be cool

[2023-01-03 06:13:54] <Altoption> @AntoniusJD Because it's not as extreme and doesn't make the viewmodel look stupid which is probably the main reason they removed the earlier bug
[2023-01-03 06:13:57] <%Miltop1G> I think that will be better if you ask me @leonatorx1298
[2023-01-03 06:14:00] <HuskiestNinja> Its essentially selecting whether or not your FOV is affected or unaffected upon ADS on COD/Warzone. Hopefully can and will be implemented easily and quickly.
[2023-01-03 06:14:16] <%Koffiekoekje> To be fair I need a second keyboard if they keep adding new keybindings
[2023-01-03 06:14:34] <+AntoniusJD> @Altoption Gotcha! I hope you're right tbh cause it's great
[2023-01-03 06:14:35] <%Koffiekoekje> But hold breath would be ok
[2023-01-03 06:14:40] <%+DraX_Core> so to stop the fov zoom. I scope in > free look > then press tab while free looking?
[2023-01-03 06:14:45] <%KevinSredz> @Koffiekoekje make use of the double click/continuous settings where you can
[2023-01-03 06:14:45] <pablolaflame1> So im guessing new nods werent added this wipe
[2023-01-03 06:14:51] <%+TheYellaKing> from a spectating perspective that shit looks way more natural with the ADS
[2023-01-03 06:15:03] <brentonbazz> I feel like increasing the fov actually takes away from the immersion
[2023-01-03 06:15:04] <Altoption> @AntoniusJD Yeah feels like a different game almost LUL

[2023-01-03 06:31:32] <%Thewaterlord27> I feel like it’s a bug.

[2023-01-03 06:38:54] <T_Hennyy> @Klean how would you define one being better than the other than "this one" is great and "this one" is bad, what makes it bad?
[2023-01-03 06:38:59] <SevenTruths> Give a chance for you to trip and be knocked prone if running in free aim XD
[2023-01-03 06:39:01] <+ryanthewise_> Running across hallways is a movement problem
[2023-01-03 06:39:03] <%themissing8> Have they confirmed they are adding postures? Like high and low ready?

[2023-01-03 06:46:17] <+Andcef> @Andcef really the entire movement system is pretty borked, you can play any other fps and you can make very small micro adjustments in position from just tapping, there is a bit of acceleration and deceleration. in tarkov it just seems like you go from a stop to full speed and then full stop, really choppy

[2023-01-03 07:20:41] <+That_Absolute_Unit> @suspicious_potatoes The audio seems insanely bad. I’m surprised more people aren’t talking about it if they’re experiencing what I am

If my rig is full, and I'm gonna have to drop it anyway, why would you slow reload? It would clearly communicate that I've dropped a mag. No brainer! New FOV feature good tho thanks BSG!

[2023-01-03 07:48:28] <%ionuji> honestly a much needed change as a setting
[2023-01-03 07:48:42] <%ionuji> like a keybind in arma
[2023-01-03 07:49:13] <%ForsaikenRedskye> it does and no very many people utilize prone leaning either so, it wouldn't be a big issue.

[2023-01-03 07:50:32] <CoL3> ^
[2023-01-03 07:50:37] <@%SpottedTango> @SamuraiSavv I run the 5800x and the 3080 underwater myself, awesome hardware! got those both cooled just fine on a single thick 360mm
[2023-01-03 07:50:43] <+Zezzku> @Klean What I really want, is that when you use a PSO type scope, you could still look under it and use the iron sights
[2023-01-03 07:50:47] <%ForsaikenRedskye> yeah, that's how they have it in Star Citizen as well... you just roll over instead of leaning
[2023-01-03 07:50:49] <0PYR3X> at least reroll the update for audio it is just unacceptable
[2023-01-03 07:51:21] <%ionuji> not everyone is having audio issues
[2023-01-03 07:51:26] <%ionuji> so rerolling wouldn't help

[2023-01-03 07:51:55] <@%SamuraiSavv> @SpottedTango I need to take a look at my temps again to make sure everything is running fine but yeah. I have a 3070ti in mine. Only thing for me is that sometimes i notice a slight screen tear. Idk what could be causing it. It's not often but it does happen.
[2023-01-03 07:52:11] <0PYR3X> @ionuji because you think the audio is fine right now ?
[2023-01-03 07:52:11] <@%SamuraiSavv> Idk if something is fucked with a setting somewhere.

[2023-01-03 07:52:25] <+BoyThatsMyMeat> That ADS trick you showed earlier actually really helps. Especially with shotguns
[2023-01-03 07:52:46] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @SamuraiSavv free sync or g-sync could be causing it maybe? seq1
[2023-01-03 07:52:48] <caspases> What trick, would you explain @BoyThatsMyMeat
[2023-01-03 07:52:49] <+archaicl3gacy> Some people are saying to turn off biurnial audio. That helping anyone out?
[2023-01-03 07:52:50] <%ionuji> @0PYR3X just to reiterate, my audio is really really good WITHOUT binaural, however all my friends are complaining about bad audio
[2023-01-03 07:53:18] <0_FREEZER_0> How does something like that even get through testing?
[2023-01-03 07:53:23] <@%SpottedTango> I mean, you'll get screen tearing when framerates of devices and GPU's are out of sync no matter what. G-sync, Freesync, V-Sync or a framerate lock should sort it.
[2023-01-03 07:53:26] <vCrye> 5950 x3d ryzen and 3080ti 64gb of ram getting about 80-100 fps on customs is that normal? I feel like my old setup did that, running 1440p for ref
[2023-01-03 07:53:32] <@%SpottedTango> @SamuraiSavv
[2023-01-03 07:53:37] <@%SamuraiSavv> @ForsaikenRedskye I'll have to take a look. Pretty sure it's not on. I have a 32" 144hz samsung monitor. I made sure it's set to 144 fps and that the settings in the nvidia control pannel is also set to 144.
[2023-01-03 07:53:39] <%ionuji> @0_FREEZER_0 just like any other bug, happens to some not to all
[2023-01-03 07:53:50] <+BoyThatsMyMeat> @caspases He put a video explaining it on his twitter
[2023-01-03 07:53:54] <@%SamuraiSavv> Interesting

[2023-01-03 07:54:30] <@%SamuraiSavv> Hm.
[2023-01-03 07:54:43] <@%SpottedTango> @SamuraiSavv if you dip under or too far over 144 with syncing off, or outside of the freesync/g-sync target ranges, ou'll still get tears

[2023-01-03 07:55:20] <0PYR3X> @ionuji removing binaural helps to remove lags, but both audios are really bad right now even without. Theres absolutely no vertical at all. People in front of you sound so close but they are far away, you can hear thru 3 floors (with voip too) Idk men I cant believe you not experiencing theses problems.
[2023-01-03 07:55:24] <%ForsaikenRedskye> seq1 cause i get that too when i have freesync on with my monitor but on in the AMD software
[2023-01-03 07:55:26] <cribbageboard> how do you do the free look?
[2023-01-03 07:55:30] <@%SamuraiSavv> @SpottedTango Ok. Figured. Like I said, doesn't happen often. With my old parts, it was constant because they were fried LUL

[2023-01-03 08:07:44] <@%SamuraiSavv> I find it odd that the free look had a weird lock on it. Like you don't move the mount at a certain speed, your guy freaks out and won't free look.

[2023-01-03 17:32:50] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> I'll try upscaling it to 1440p for this next video
[2023-01-03 17:32:51] <%Dev_24> also its a feature in a lot of FPS games today so I dont see why they dont add it.
[2023-01-03 17:32:54] <UEemperor> @RatPhd Youtube videos are up to 1080p resolution. If you render it in a higher res, you will keep some of the source resolution, even with youtubes compression.

[2023-01-03 17:34:12] <UEemperor> @JoshuaGuzz never used twitch so i dont know how it works.  What i do for mine is upscale the render resolution, and it helps quite a bit. Feel free to send a msg on DC later.
[2023-01-03 17:34:17] <%Dev_24> does the FOV bug go away when you freelook?
[2023-01-03 17:34:19] <+LegaIizeRanch> @Dev_24 huh, okay thanks

[2023-01-03 17:34:36] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> @LegaIizeRanch your covert movement skill is low level and you're most likely in the yellow weight which makes you louder

[2023-01-03 17:35:20] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> @JoshuaGuzz there isn't a lot of motion, that helps a lot with the bitrate
[2023-01-03 17:35:35] <UEemperor> @RatPhd dont get me wrong im not smashing the last one, im saying its always 1080p, and it loses some of its clarity. Ive had that happen on my vids as well.

[2023-01-03 17:36:12] <%+RatPhd> @UEemperor Clarity is not entirely resolution, though. Some of the quality loss is due to compression, especially when he does night raids

[2023-01-03 17:37:13] <UEemperor> @RatPhd yeah, absolutely. But it still is helpful to upscale the vid in the renderer/video editor while also keeping it as source as possible, and it WILL help show more even with compression.

[2023-01-03 17:38:53] <%+RatPhd> @UEemperor I am not sure upscaling a compressed video is going to do much though really. It sounds like the VOD comes from Twitch and is downloaded, it isn't a recording directly from the source
[2023-01-03 17:39:00] <paytso108> always wondered why there isn't a level 1 body armor like some airsoft cardboard garbage or something

[2023-01-03 17:39:28] <UEemperor> @RatPhd yeah thats what im not clear about how it works. If its so, then yeah its what it is. Still, worth a try.
[2023-01-03 17:39:37] <+GILBZ09> Does the FOV bug stop working after a raid?
[2023-01-03 17:40:08] <%veryrarejosh> @GILBZ09 you gotta do it every raid

[2023-01-03 17:48:47] <overstoff> @Zetta_OG if you freelook to the right until it zooms out, then center your screen as you press tab, it will lock the zoomed out fov to your ads

[2023-01-03 18:12:40] <+CptBrainlag> @FatherOwens most available starter weapons are garbage and suck to use
[2023-01-03 18:12:43] <qaim__> in between
[2023-01-03 18:12:44] <%ekozaur> @jura7 So the "splinter cell" refers to a sub-division of an agency.
[2023-01-03 18:12:45] <trojanmcbean> I think they need 2 development teams, a patch team and a content team.
[2023-01-03 18:12:52] <cosiek11> I want dynamic economy, where things can become more scarce etc.
[2023-01-03 18:12:55] <+TRWilly> what's this an ads bug?
[2023-01-03 18:12:58] <+LaTutta> Your bug vod is popping off so it might be thing soon #coopium
[2023-01-03 18:12:59] <zyn_g0d> that bug should be added as a feature i seen your video last night!
[2023-01-03 18:13:00] <%+Ergotic33> i mean 5 head yee but early wipe is so much fun dude
[2023-01-03 18:13:02] <semistupidd> the dysnc in this game makes pvp really unenjoyable to me, plus getting one tap by scavs
[2023-01-03 18:13:05] <%ElPonete> Do you think they can introruce voulting how the maps are build rigth now? Or maybe they have to rework them?
[2023-01-03 18:13:08] <+FatherOwens> @CptBrainlag i think all weapons/gear should be avail at level 1,, to everyone.  but make them harder to get (barter only)

[2023-01-03 18:22:01] <+Zetta_OG> has anyone tried the HAGS thing for FPS that was all over reddit?
[2023-01-03 18:22:02] <zyn_g0d> looks so good with scope ^
[2023-01-03 18:22:09] <semistupidd> they'll be fast to patch that but not other things lmao
[2023-01-03 18:22:18] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> I remember a few patches ago there was a bug that made something feel way better and then they removed it...
[2023-01-03 18:22:19] <%ToxikToad> Sup Klean how’s it hangin today my guy

[2023-01-03 18:22:32] <killernik> is the stuff you you get at start of wipe worth playing with or is it better to vendor it and invest i something else?
[2023-01-03 18:23:00] <buddhacheesa> @killernik Most of it is great to have and use tbh.
[2023-01-03 18:23:01] <semistupidd> @killernik the paca is good for start

[2023-01-03 18:23:22] <wenomdaddy> hey klean
[2023-01-03 18:23:23] <+CptBrainlag> What I probably hate most about this game is that the gunplay just feels so goddamn floaty and unweildy
[2023-01-03 18:23:50] <+CptBrainlag> it's so hard to stay on target if you're not laying still somewhere since you shoot like one shot and the scope blocks the enemy
[2023-01-03 18:23:59] <hightierdog> ddg waiting room
[2023-01-03 18:23:59] <+mariophysx> to be fair, you wouldnt aim your gun from half a metre away, you just dont do it, it feels way more natural if it zooms in tbh
[2023-01-03 18:24:03] <sneulv1> in arma freelook was good for not revealing ur position by limiting char model movement. and for looking around when running.
[2023-01-03 18:24:03] <%+FrostyyTheSnowThug> could just go to the tange in the hideout

[2023-01-03 18:24:47] <+VladuFTW> freeLook.m_XAxis.Value = 0, freeLook.m_YAxis.Value = 0 problem fixed :P
[2023-01-03 18:24:47] <%jjbkilla> does it help with the fps when you do that?
[2023-01-03 18:24:53] <+vngeleyes> independent/affected fov slider like cod. looks way more natural
[2023-01-03 18:24:54] <%ToxikToad> More natural who’s eyes zoom in when you ads irl???
[2023-01-03 18:24:57] <Rymdflicka> makes LPVOs way better IMO
[2023-01-03 18:25:14] <%wubnoxious> looks more natural seeing your arms too. now normally it looks like my dude has his head tilted up LUL

[2023-01-03 18:25:30] <%ElPonete> And what do you think about include some fast walk? Not sprint, something in between walk and sprint? I saw a lot of Special force and the move faster when AIM
[2023-01-03 18:25:30] <%+ZayneD420> what am i using
[2023-01-03 18:25:31] <+UltimoScottishh> That's niceeee man

[2023-01-03 18:25:55] <+FatherOwens> IRL thats how you look thru a scope initially. you dont press your face so close once you aim
[2023-01-03 18:25:56] <+duckduckati> Just watched your FOV vid, nice. Just wondered what your settings are on now? looked good in the video
[2023-01-03 18:25:56] <semistupidd> @florio7 nah its a bug

[2023-01-03 18:26:19] <+mariophysx> @ToxikToad u dont seem to understand - if you move your eyes closer to the scope you obviously can see less around and more of the scope, it feels like "zooming in"

[2023-01-03 18:26:45] <killernik> its very nasty when the FOV changes when you ads, much easier to keep track of targets when its constant
[2023-01-03 18:26:54] <+mariophysx> @ToxikToad dunno if you ever held a gun, it just feels more natural to me
[2023-01-03 18:27:02] <+FatherOwens> Do we know if that bug was introduced in latest patch? or did we just discover it

[2023-01-03 18:28:26] <%ElPonete> And what do you think about include some fast walk? something in between walk and sprint? i ve seen that in RL, the soldiers clean rooms faster when Aim.
[2023-01-03 18:28:30] <+FatherOwens> @SevenTruths scavs buffed this patch i believe

[2023-01-03 18:31:55] <%jjbkilla> if you lower your overall visibility in settings it help with the lagginess on streets and bring your fps up a little

[2023-01-03 22:50:09] <%+GotJuh> @TenkiKeyboard i think he upgraded to 660s, and theyre only 150ohm so most DACs are fine with em'
[2023-01-03 22:50:17] <%+Rorviticus> if this works maybe veritas should know about it to do some testing of his own??

[2023-01-03 22:51:08] <%RyseUpGaming> ask if it effects headphones the same way as it will affect iems
[2023-01-03 22:51:20] <CholThemAll> can anyone please explain what they're doing here overall? Would that work for everybody, or thats hardware specific?

[2023-01-03 22:51:48] <stellarb> BBoomer
[2023-01-03 22:52:03] <%+GotJuh> DTS isnt doing anything that a virtual surround application does, so if you guys have DACs most of the software for those have a virtualizer. SO i would check out your stuff before making a purchase imo.
[2023-01-03 22:52:08] <%$trickypig> what is this program called?
[2023-01-03 22:52:12] <ItsTvang> they are turning on a surround software on the PCs for binaural audio to work optimally
[2023-01-03 22:52:18] <%+AttemptedPants> DTS Unbound
[2023-01-03 22:52:20] <CholThemAll> @FatherOwens appreciate the answer man. Do you know if it is hardware specific?
[2023-01-03 22:52:24] <%+QuickStrik33> i was tryin this out with the THX surround on and made a huge difference
[2023-01-03 22:52:35] <XtremeGucci> i use binaurel audio with dolby atmos i usually get 100 to 115 fps i do feel like the sound is a bit wonky at times like i hear stuff im not suppose to

[2023-01-03 22:52:44] <overstoff> so turn on dts and binaural?

[2023-01-03 22:52:52] <+FatherOwens> @CholThemAll nah  dont think so, its software you download. it may be sound-card dependent but if you have modern hardware, should be ok
[2023-01-03 22:52:58] <ItsTvang> nope they are buying a DTS Surround
[2023-01-03 22:53:24] <Bailz94> Download deez
[2023-01-03 22:53:30] <tsiigaaja> Surround sound software doesn't give you actual 3D sound if its not integrated into the game

[2023-01-03 22:53:48] <overstoff> cool, but still have binaural enabled in game I guess?

[2023-01-03 22:59:54] <%+GotJuh> @JoshuaGuzz Because that's the "Center" speaker being virtualized since its sound coming from your character
[2023-01-03 22:59:58] <SilverCyberFox> damn those steps are quiet wtf
[2023-01-03 22:59:59] <%+FallenLemin> I  think thats how footsteps should be

[2023-01-03 23:00:21] <%+Weizenbeir> already sounds better, just a little like the sounds is infront of you
[2023-01-03 23:00:22] <%Ayomeer> Hutch's sound is pretty different. He's using DTS: Headphone X while Klean is using DTS: X. Dunno if he also has different ingame headphones though

[2023-01-03 23:01:08] <ItsTvang> Klean do u have compression or "loudness equalization" on?

[2023-01-03 23:01:46] <%Ayomeer> @Ayomeer There was a bit of a misunderstanding there. He said Headphone X when Hutch clarified but when klean was asking he just said X so he chose X
[2023-01-03 23:01:51] <Saro4president> binaural testing?
[2023-01-03 23:02:03] <ItsTvang> testing surround software with binaural on
[2023-01-03 23:02:10] <Saro4president> or irl stuff testing?

[2023-01-03 23:02:20] <%masterhenkie> @Ayomeer Yeah I bought the same one that Klean bought
[2023-01-03 23:02:25] <+Technical_13> Klean's audio sounds way different
[2023-01-03 23:02:28] <+Technical_13> than hutches

[2023-01-03 23:02:43] <Niibler> @Klean you and Hutch are using different things
[2023-01-03 23:02:43] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> @Klean try making some noises behind you
[2023-01-03 23:02:48] <%+FallenLemin> the sounds are placing correctly
[2023-01-03 23:02:50] <Goldie_Gun> would be cool if the sound in game just was passable.
[2023-01-03 23:02:58] <%zielis_the_noodle> Try it on interchange ? @Klean
[2023-01-03 23:02:58] <EZmethod> DTS sound unbound
[2023-01-03 23:03:01] <Renny_UK> Your sound are way different to Hutch's
[2023-01-03 23:03:04] <+CallMeVasily> vertical audio better with this ya think
[2023-01-03 23:03:13] <Niibler> @Klean you and Hutch are using different versions already
[2023-01-03 23:03:13] <ItsTvang> test vertical audio
[2023-01-03 23:03:30] <%+GotJuh> @tsiigaaja If the surround virtualizer works good. testing to see if there is more directional audio rather than the typical muddy sound
[2023-01-03 23:03:31] <%+DraX_Core> @Klean different versions
[2023-01-03 23:03:35] <%Ayomeer> @CallMeVasily feel like that stuff is gonna be more dependent on how well teh audio occlusion zones are placed
[2023-01-03 23:03:35] <loot_boxxx> @CallMeVasily there is no vertical audio this will clear things up but is not going to rebuild tha audio engine.
[2023-01-03 23:03:42] <+Technical_13> Hutch's audio sounds WAY better
[2023-01-03 23:03:46] <Saphyroth> Planatronics has an amazing digital surround, just checked and its the same thing in essence. So who ever has planatronics headset ya dont need dts.
[2023-01-03 23:03:54] <Niibler> someone tell @Klean to use HEADPHONE X
[2023-01-03 23:04:00] <tsiigaaja> @GotJuh Hmm alright. Im very skeptical about this kinda stuff. How would the surround software know where the sound originates from?
[2023-01-03 23:04:10] <tsiigaaja> Like front or back
[2023-01-03 23:04:14] <loot_boxxx> @Klean should try dif comtacs
[2023-01-03 23:04:20] <%Ayomeer> Oh nevermind then
[2023-01-03 23:04:23] <+SaltyCorncob> shouldbnt be able to hear footsteps through walls and stuff

[2023-01-03 23:04:58] <+Technical_13> someone tell Klean to listen to Hutch's audio, his sounds way better
[2023-01-03 23:05:01] <+demonic2580> i thought binural was to be turned off because of fps issues tried and cofirmed?
[2023-01-03 23:05:02] <%+DraX_Core> !partner
[2023-01-03 23:05:03] <GRAVitized> Sounds hollow, centered. All of it.
[2023-01-03 23:05:06] <sweeney1> isn't this just virtualized surround sound?
[2023-01-03 23:05:13] <%RichyLovy> Lest listen to Paul Allen sound.

[2023-01-03 23:05:31] <%revcasy> @demonic2580 it is still screwed up yeah
[2023-01-03 23:05:36] <%masterhenkie> That's cool
[2023-01-03 23:05:47] <%+GotJuh> @tsiigaaja because the game makes noises that originate from the "noise maker" that bounces towards the player much like how sound is in real life, so what the virtualizer does is pick up that sound a plays it to the correct speaker in the soundscape
[2023-01-03 23:06:06] <+zool162> probably sounds different to them than it does to us
[2023-01-03 23:06:08] <Schniebel> what are they testing?
[2023-01-03 23:06:12] <Saro4president> binaural its on btw guys?

[2023-01-03 23:06:32] <tsiigaaja> @GotJuh But the virtualizer does not have actual data about where the sound source is in the game scene right?

[2023-01-03 23:13:15] <kangtaum> chat you can try dts for 2 weeks trial
[2023-01-03 23:13:21] <+EzPickenz1> Klean you can search for your specific headphone they might have a tune for it in DTS
[2023-01-03 23:13:27] <kangtaum> #ad
[2023-01-03 23:13:27] <+chapel> what was the setting that @Klean changed that was causing his to sound different?
[2023-01-03 23:13:29] <JPSMO> coop mode
[2023-01-03 23:13:31] <+Fuzam88> dont you have to enable coop mode or is that only host?
[2023-01-03 23:13:34] <+Redemption99> @sauzynugletzx just a lot of people scaving so harder to find a match

[2023-01-03 23:13:44] <+Vultic> What is dts?
[2023-01-03 23:13:49] <%$Deezil_Wood> Does Customs use the new audio engine?  I'm curious how this tweak affects the legacy audio.
[2023-01-03 23:13:59] <EZmethod> @Klean turn on spawn in one spot

[2023-01-03 23:14:51] <shiverpk> offline raids?
[2023-01-03 23:14:53] <%$Deezil_Wood> Windows Sonic will make it sound like that.
[2023-01-03 23:14:58] <ItsTvang> are we testing with binaural off rn?
[2023-01-03 23:15:05] <ItsTvang> or just sonic studio off
[2023-01-03 23:15:08] <+Vultic> @kangtaum Is that what they downloaded?
[2023-01-03 23:15:09] <%+Weizenbeir> do you really have to reset the game every 4 games or so with this audio set up?

[2023-01-03 23:15:33] <kangtaum> @Vultic yea in windows store dts unbound
[2023-01-03 23:15:37] <EZmethod> or will buy it
[2023-01-03 23:15:44] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> Issue: wouldn't we need examples under the same conditions without DTS to make this an actual test?
[2023-01-03 23:15:46] <+FuLLyReKTT> isnt there something Rengar said about offline co-op will always register your party members footsteps VS online other players.
[2023-01-03 23:15:51] <tsiigaaja> Just play woods, no audio occlusion issues lol
[2023-01-03 23:15:54] <tsiigaaja> No walls
[2023-01-03 23:15:54] <%+Bows0108> lmao " if we can get the most basic audio found in any other game, it will be a miracle"
[2023-01-03 23:15:57] <+Vultic> @kangtaum Sweet! Thank ya!
[2023-01-03 23:15:57] <ItsTvang> @Weizenbeir with binaural on, at all, causes a memory leak and reduces performance
[2023-01-03 23:15:59] <%$Deezil_Wood> @ItsTvang Binaural on and DTS HeadphonesX plugin.
[2023-01-03 23:15:59] <tsiigaaja> No floors
[2023-01-03 23:16:07] <+karnyvekz> So, the current idea is: binaural audio on, and have DTS Sound Unbound installed/enabled?
[2023-01-03 23:16:09] <EntropyB> You could also compare Windows Sonic vs DTS with binaural on

[2023-01-03 23:16:18] <Agarthan> for a game that is so heavily focused on audio queues it's inexcusable that the sound mapping is shit @Klean
[2023-01-03 23:16:28] <EZmethod> @Klean this dts works without bi audio?
[2023-01-03 23:16:36] <$tonyzeee> Did my first cold plunge today dude🥶🥶🥶
[2023-01-03 23:16:43] <kangtaum> @Vultic also u will need to enable spatial sound in windows, right click on icon with volume(bottom right corner) :)
[2023-01-03 23:16:45] <ItsTvang> @karnyvekz they are testing with DTS. u can try others like dolby or window sonic

[2023-01-03 23:17:32] <EntropyB> @klean you guys should also wear the same headset in game
[2023-01-03 23:17:34] <+TheSaltSlingingHasher> I have the same issue you have, not crisp like Hutch's
[2023-01-03 23:17:36] <EntropyB> if you arent already

[2023-01-03 23:17:55] <Renny_UK> Hutch's definitely sounds better - as you said, a little fish tanky
[2023-01-03 23:18:02] <%Ayomeer> @EZmethod restart game after every raid for now Sadge
[2023-01-03 23:18:14] <kangtaum> @Vultic and then you can pick one of codecs to use, one is free sonic windows something, and other is this dts headphone x
[2023-01-03 23:18:28] <Agarthan> i have senns sound does sound a little fish tanky

[2023-01-03 23:22:05] <loot_boxxx> @EZmethod it is not going to give you any audio you wouldnt get before its only going to help with clarity and depth it does no t change how the in game audio engine functions thats up to bsg to fix
[2023-01-03 23:22:08] <%RyseUpGaming> in my dts

[2023-01-03 23:22:49] <%AmoryWars> 3rd is way quieter than 2nd
[2023-01-03 23:22:50] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> Like Left and Right yeah I think I can hear the improvements, but vertically, I don't really see a difference. The CONTEXT CLUES from positioning and the Occlusions zones definitely still play the most part I feel like.
[2023-01-03 23:22:51] <Agarthan> it's missing mids/lows
[2023-01-03 23:22:51] <EZmethod> @Saro4president agreed
[2023-01-03 23:23:01] <QuestionmarkTimes2> they actually fixed vertical sounds at the cost of 40fps
[2023-01-03 23:23:04] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> Well I guess I wouldn't be able to see
[2023-01-03 23:23:05] <Saphyroth> To be fair binaural without any extras sounds a lot better with vertical audio issue is how it makes the game run.. :(
[2023-01-03 23:23:07] <Agarthan> it got significantly quieter

[2023-01-03 23:25:08] <%Ayomeer> @EZmethod How is his offline raid fps relevant to you?
[2023-01-03 23:25:14] <GRAVitized> Audio is like ice cream flavors... Change my mind.

[2023-01-03 23:25:22] <daz_enners> yours is sounding better than Hutch's
[2023-01-03 23:25:24] <Box_043> your audio is much better than hutch's
[2023-01-03 23:25:25] <+XenoShade8> its different

[2023-01-03 23:25:37] <+Bloodfallzz> Do this...Turn around and face the door. Have him run behind you on first, then have him run on 2nd
[2023-01-03 23:25:44] <Agarthan> may be you have better headphones too
[2023-01-03 23:25:48] <mister__47> Reserve bunkers are the true test
[2023-01-03 23:25:51] <+jonnyboiyoi> does klean have binaural on or off?
[2023-01-03 23:25:53] <%+GotJuh> LOL we are taking audio experience from a half deaf guy XDDD
[2023-01-03 23:25:54] <%+dizzyhippydrake> and its the program that makes it better?
[2023-01-03 23:25:57] <Agarthan> high fidelity phones always make a huge difference
[2023-01-03 23:25:58] <+XenoShade8> yours is way more obvious than hutches. Hutches still has a few spots where it sounds too loud
[2023-01-03 23:26:02] <%Booglelele> wait so hutchs binaural is on on kleans is off
[2023-01-03 23:26:05] <FishHoook> would this fix that one bunker where you can fire in it and not hear shit 1ft outside it?
[2023-01-03 23:26:06] <%+apuhlii> @jonnyboiyoi its on
[2023-01-03 23:26:07] <%shmoe_shman> on headphone x, did Klean select Spacious or Balance for Spatial Mode?
[2023-01-03 23:26:10] <%ArcticHusky> chat what are they testing righ now?

[2023-01-03 23:26:55] <%5cavlive5matt3r> Are they testing binaural?
[2023-01-03 23:26:57] <%+Bows0108> this is great but think about how messed up it is that they have to do this to get proper sound...
[2023-01-03 23:27:08] <+aarontxx> what are they adjusting?
[2023-01-03 23:27:10] <babe_harris> what changed with the sound?
[2023-01-03 23:27:14] <GRAVitized> It's Tarkov Science.
[2023-01-03 23:27:16] <mister__47> @aarontxx audio
[2023-01-03 23:27:17] <pablolaflame1> what yall doing exactly?
[2023-01-03 23:27:23] <+runosrevenge> well this a if you know you know type of situation.
[2023-01-03 23:27:27] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Bows0108 I think Veritas once said there is no quick fix but they have to rebuild from the ground up. But I could be wrong
[2023-01-03 23:27:28] <%+PapaToasty> This could be big advantage
[2023-01-03 23:27:30] <rudyboi> klean breaking fov and now audio kleanReee

[2023-01-03 23:27:34] <%ArcticHusky> @elmate715 what is dts audio?
[2023-01-03 23:27:39] <Box_043> what are klean's audio settings because his are so much better than hutch's
[2023-01-03 23:27:40] <trapys> @GRAVitized this is very far away from science ^^
[2023-01-03 23:27:41] <+effusivemind> they are testing a software to adjust sound
[2023-01-03 23:27:42] <%Ayomeer> They're testing a third party program to improve the occulus audio, chat
[2023-01-03 23:27:55] <Chris114> this is not needed for us that suck at eft  lol but its cool
[2023-01-03 23:28:04] <+A_BootyBandito> What rounds do the underbarrel on the ak use, the 40mm that used to have no real purpose?
[2023-01-03 23:28:09] <pablolaflame1> @Ayomeer is it having good results?
[2023-01-03 23:28:12] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Ayomeer Regardless of binaural? Because many people can't use it. It's bugged.
[2023-01-03 23:28:13] <kangtaum> dts balanced or spacious tho 🤔
[2023-01-03 23:28:17] <+XenoShade8> Klean, Hutch still has some issues with clear sound when above. You do not, as soon as he is above you its obvious. When you are above him its not
[2023-01-03 23:28:19] <%$trickypig> @pablolaflame1 yes pretty sure
[2023-01-03 23:28:23] <EvanWolf> basically the stairwell sounds all the same
[2023-01-03 23:28:32] <%tomc1k> when he right on top of you sounds get buggy
[2023-01-03 23:28:34] <prozak995> Veritas showed in his video that any sound enhancements like DTS or surround sound will fuck up the sounds
[2023-01-03 23:28:36] <%+GotJuh> We all like to judge BSG but it's not as simple as people make it seem to adjust and code for the soundscape that EFT has. A LOT of games struggle with vertical audio
[2023-01-03 23:28:40] <%+IR0GUE_> So Tarkov can be released?
[2023-01-03 23:28:41] <%tomc1k> if you were a bit further it would sound better
[2023-01-03 23:28:46] <jsack1519> can you post what settings are on twitter?
[2023-01-03 23:28:50] <EZmethod> gun shots sounds like in eft raid 4 ep

[2023-01-03 23:28:56] <%Ayomeer> @pablolaflame1 seems pretty good, but can't fix the issues caused by occlusion zones, namely the stairwell issue
[2023-01-03 23:29:03] <rudyboi> the casing sounmds
[2023-01-03 23:29:04] <%Ayomeer> @5cavlive5matt3r It's for use with binaural
[2023-01-03 23:29:09] <Aloomiii> what about nade on second and third 🤔 ?
[2023-01-03 23:29:10] <%wubnoxious> @prozak995 true but that was also with steam audio and binural on, good to at least test this
[2023-01-03 23:29:14] <kangtaum> @prozak995 any of his video is outdated this patch we have new sound versioun
[2023-01-03 23:29:15] <+elmate715> @prozak995 Fuck up in what way?

[2023-01-03 23:29:32] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @5cavlive5matt3r I can't use it or the game will stutter
[2023-01-03 23:29:46] <prozak995> @prozak995 its not outdated, he litterally said in his last stream it still applies
[2023-01-03 23:29:48] <+StopDropNRofl> @rudyboi It's built into Windows, so no.
[2023-01-03 23:29:56] <Chris114> try talking with in game @Klean

[2023-01-03 23:30:24] <%Ayomeer> @rudyboi nah the program just takes what the game puts out and post-processes it.
[2023-01-03 23:30:24] <Saro4president> @rudyboi no lol how audio can be cheat

[2023-01-03 23:30:53] <Agarthan> you prob just need to tweak your mixer settings klean
[2023-01-03 23:30:56] <+wikidus_> you have comtacs off
[2023-01-03 23:30:56] <Saro4president> @The_Homie_Vendetta nop unfortunately
[2023-01-03 23:30:56] <+Menacingshot> is does kinda fish tank, but yours seems way more accurate than his
[2023-01-03 23:31:01] <%ceesidd> @The_Homie_Vendetta worse if you use binaural audio
[2023-01-03 23:31:03] <rudyboi> streamception

[2023-01-03 23:31:24] <%+FallenLemin> sounds same to me
[2023-01-03 23:31:25] <Agarthan> his had a little more mid/low than yours
[2023-01-03 23:31:25] <EZmethod> what's the source video in the first place? what they talking about?
[2023-01-03 23:31:31] <ShadowTempa> sounds better to me but both sound accurate
[2023-01-03 23:31:31] <Chris114> i agree
[2023-01-03 23:31:31] <%+Rorviticus> your sounds like the audio stacked or something
[2023-01-03 23:31:31] <@%Ripper203> The fishtank thing depends on your tacs when I was testing with DTS
[2023-01-03 23:31:33] <AyeGavMF> nah yoru audio on stream is dissapated

[2023-01-03 23:31:39] <Box_043> 2nd and 3rd floor footsteps sounded really similar on Hutch's audio but Klean's are way more distinct
[2023-01-03 23:31:40] <%wubnoxious> no
[2023-01-03 23:31:41] <ItsPixelWolf> Yes
[2023-01-03 23:31:43] <%wubnoxious> it wouldnt
[2023-01-03 23:31:45] <%+dizzyhippydrake> it would be the sound card no?
[2023-01-03 23:31:45] <slickhitta> fuck sake
[2023-01-03 23:31:46] <trapys> he means ingame i think
[2023-01-03 23:31:47] <%+Comrade_Sneak> No, your headphones should not matter
[2023-01-03 23:31:47] <kangtaum> maybe different soundboards
[2023-01-03 23:31:48] <+StopDropNRofl> Your stream output is super tinny in comparison to hutch's without headphones on
[2023-01-03 23:31:49] <JPSMO> dif base muffling

[2023-01-03 23:32:05] <+in40rmant> Your headphones shouldn't effect our audio.
[2023-01-03 23:32:05] <+Czmmorgan> something is not right. the audio on ur stream is def dfifferent than others ive been in today
[2023-01-03 23:32:08] <brick______> think he means in game headphones.

[2023-01-03 23:34:15] <+sL1MTman> have hutch listen to your stream @Klean
[2023-01-03 23:34:25] <Agarthan> your mixer still does sound a little weird on the mid/low end there's not much compression from those shots
[2023-01-03 23:34:38] <+GILBZ09> What's DTS?
[2023-01-03 23:34:52] VIEWERS: 1 945
[2023-01-03 23:35:17] <+sltenoo> Dolby something something
[2023-01-03 23:35:27] <AyeGavMF> because your audio is routed through a seperate interface its gonan sound different to stream
[2023-01-03 23:35:30] <loot_boxxx> @Agarthan does he even give us compression?
[2023-01-03 23:35:32] <EZmethod> @GILBZ09 DTS sound unbound

[2023-01-03 23:37:26] <%+sovvagn> so what if I use ATMOS not DTS?
[2023-01-03 23:37:39] <ShadowTempa> I prefer Atmos buddy
[2023-01-03 23:37:46] <ShadowTempa> sounds better than this IMO

[2023-01-03 23:38:01] <ItsTvang> i believe dolby atmos vs DTS is subjective
[2023-01-03 23:38:02] <+Overcast22> Sounds worse to me
[2023-01-03 23:38:06] <%RyseUpGaming> for my audio the dts makes the ambient sounds sound super weird

[2023-01-03 23:39:00] <+Overcast22> I have always been under the impression to never use any of these audio softwares for fps games
[2023-01-03 23:39:00] <%rareAesthetic> I found the new audio to have better positional but worse distance. they could be 10m or 100m idk

[2023-01-03 23:39:57] <+aarontxx> @PutinIsSmallAndBald The code for this game wasnt built to have this type of game for it.

[2023-01-03 23:40:03] <+StegTTV> @Klean i had this issue with my goxlr, i think the problem was in windows sound settings, the device was set to the wrong hertz
[2023-01-03 23:40:11] <PutinIsSmallAndBald> @aarontxx then why the fuck make such code
[2023-01-03 23:40:24] <%Ayomeer> @Overcast22 the reason this is relevant for tarkov is because of the occulus audio it uses now. This software is made for the specific type of encoding it uses, apparently
[2023-01-03 23:40:26] <PutinIsSmallAndBald> @aarontxx literally had 0 fucking audio in d2 right now
