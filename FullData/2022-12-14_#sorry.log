[2022-12-14 00:34:34] <%ab_Rogue> when I make ramen, unless I buy specific flavor, I buy the generic brick noodles and season it myself, I use chicken stock, and I add canned chicken while I'm doing the seasoning of the broth
[2022-12-14 00:34:43] <%ab_Rogue> but anyway I'm going to lurk and listen and work
[2022-12-14 00:34:44] <sir_llewellyn> surprisingly warm

[2022-12-14 00:35:43] <%ab_Rogue> rotisserie chicken is definitely a good idea. a quick way to make ramen creamier is unironically sliced cheese

[2022-12-14 21:46:42] <%LauraGlatz> I mean people talk allot at the start then it calms down and silence takes over and thats fine
[2022-12-14 21:46:49] <%jackjumbo> like im talking about a game and i hear a minute long slurp over the mic
[2022-12-14 21:47:27] <%takeoutthethrash> thats pro advice kinda just try and make yourself laugh
