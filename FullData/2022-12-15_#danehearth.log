[2022-12-15 17:07:53] <skysoul8> its because they had 10 mana i guess
[2022-12-15 17:07:55] <%$10TC> Do you think there are other angles to building a concoction rogue deck aside from miracle and this one?

[2022-12-15 17:40:34] <Vagus> Is it just me, or does the whole game just shudder every once in a while?
[2022-12-15 17:40:42] <Vagus> Like the screen just vibrates slightly
[2022-12-15 17:41:12] <HegelianCope> shudderwock background radiation from 2018
[2022-12-15 17:41:27] <%+dumbgamerboy> Arcane Bolt 🤓
[2022-12-15 17:41:32] <$SpykoNukov> @Vagus yeah when dmg are dealt, depending on how much the screen shake
[2022-12-15 17:41:44] <Vagus> SpykoNukov I mean outside of that
[2022-12-15 17:41:56] <$SpykoNukov> ah then idk
[2022-12-15 17:42:01] <Vagus> It shudders ever so slightly when nothing happens
[2022-12-15 17:42:06] <common_pepe_meme> this new loatheb card seems quite good
[2022-12-15 17:42:09] <Vagus> I've noticed it started with the new update
[2022-12-15 17:42:14] <%$10TC> Yeah mine does that too @Vagus
[2022-12-15 17:42:16] <meghdut> loatheb is a-ok
[2022-12-15 17:42:23] <%+dumbgamerboy> loatheb most broken card in the set
[2022-12-15 17:42:42] <skysoul8> fuck that one druid in particular
[2022-12-15 17:42:44] <Vagus> 10TC ok so im not crazy thank god
[2022-12-15 17:42:53] <DameNightmare> not many nax cards are used
[2022-12-15 17:43:03] <HegelianCope> loatheb most wholesome boi
[2022-12-15 17:43:09] <SilentStorm_0001> dk in wild? KEKWait
[2022-12-15 17:43:34] <%agentJN52> they need to add a new loatheb sometime. "loatheb the loathesome" or some shit
[2022-12-15 17:44:06] <DameNightmare> i didnt relaize dk had a ferocious roar. you can win with trash just liek druid or shaman
[2022-12-15 17:44:32] <+BotIsTrash_> what about green
[2022-12-15 17:44:50] <%$10TC> what other win conditions does rogue have in wild?
[2022-12-15 17:45:12] <common_pepe_meme> D: it wasn't death knight?!?
[2022-12-15 17:45:31] <$SpykoNukov> @10TC miracle
[2022-12-15 17:45:48] <common_pepe_meme> @10TC pillager, mine, edwin
[2022-12-15 17:46:13] <shopherodobrasil> yes double ilusion is the way to stop him
[2022-12-15 17:46:29] <vadim65ru> Oi Mate!
[2022-12-15 17:46:52] <$SpykoNukov> why not shadowstep the loatheb ?
[2022-12-15 17:47:52] <meghdut> muh value
[2022-12-15 17:48:09] <shopherodobrasil> nice turn
[2022-12-15 17:48:23] <$SpykoNukov> welp guess they aren't playing for the next 5 turs LUL
[2022-12-15 17:48:26] <%$grognardish> evenin' lad, hope it's going well
[2022-12-15 17:48:35] <p1alemdar> now he is like fuck I shoulda kill that loatheb
[2022-12-15 17:48:53] <Torontomike416> Don’t u like win the game ? Why is he trying lol
[2022-12-15 17:49:03] <$SpykoNukov> @danehearth I've noticed that you don't shadowstep loatheb sometime, like there t5 or in one of your latest video. Why is that ? is 5 more dmg worth the risk of loosing that wincon ?
[2022-12-15 17:49:33] <shopherodobrasil> @p1alemdar yes kill every tech card in board

[2022-12-15 17:50:00] VIEWERS: 393
[2022-12-15 17:50:18] <%+dumbgamerboy> nearly everyone at legend is playing a known card list, if you know your loatheb blocks all possible answers its 5 free damage
[2022-12-15 17:50:48] <V1PMONKEY> it wasn't tho he could have killed it
[2022-12-15 17:51:03] <planetfunk64> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-15 17:51:03] <$SpykoNukov> but right there loatheb lived only because of a missplay. idk I guess I'm too cautious ?
[2022-12-15 17:51:05] <%+dumbgamerboy> clearly had other priorities then
[2022-12-15 17:51:31] <shopherodobrasil> wrong choce
[2022-12-15 17:51:34] <shopherodobrasil> choice*
[2022-12-15 17:51:57] <%+dumbgamerboy> It's been 84 years
[2022-12-15 17:52:49] <$SpykoNukov> anyway, that deck seems really fun to play, I'm only missing scabb, guess I'll craft it if discolock get nerfed
[2022-12-15 17:53:50] <%+dumbgamerboy> did they nerf disco?
[2022-12-15 17:53:57] <$SpykoNukov> "potion of fuck you in particular"
[2022-12-15 17:54:01] <$SpykoNukov> no I said "if"
[2022-12-15 17:54:41] <%agentJN52> i would think its worth to smack with weapon instead so you can keep the stealth on the ghost
[2022-12-15 17:54:43] <HegelianCope> the devs are prolly playing it on ladder and thinking it's fun
[2022-12-15 17:54:57] <PeYceBall> potions is oldschool, now we have cocs YEP
[2022-12-15 17:54:58] <blissteringcold> are all potions possible to get combined twice like deal 3 damage one ? e.g. draw 2 cards twice ?
[2022-12-15 17:55:05] <$SpykoNukov> yep
[2022-12-15 17:55:11] <%+dumbgamerboy> yes
[2022-12-15 17:55:19] <$SpykoNukov> there's even a succes to get all 15 possible combo
[2022-12-15 17:55:22] <$SpykoNukov> was a bitch to get
[2022-12-15 17:55:37] <shopherodobrasil> he wants to kill you
[2022-12-15 17:55:48] <PeYceBall> @SpykoNukov just be lucky lol 4Head
[2022-12-15 17:55:54] <PeYceBall> or abuse putricide
[2022-12-15 17:55:55] <+lindhop> unofficial words from devs is belt is supposed to be able to give 2 of the same but is bugged.  will be fixed
[2022-12-15 17:56:14] <%+dumbgamerboy> source: I made it up
[2022-12-15 17:56:28] <+lindhop> source J_alex stream where he said gallon said
[2022-12-15 17:56:45] <$SpykoNukov> @SpykoNukov you can also abuse rtandom generate with the one drop and bounce, and play potion you already played all combo to try and get new combo
[2022-12-15 17:56:45] <HegelianCope> gallon deez nuts
[2022-12-15 17:56:47] <%+dumbgamerboy> J alex makes things up all the time
[2022-12-15 17:57:02] <shopherodobrasil> armor vendor + vanish
[2022-12-15 17:57:09] <blissteringcold> also i think the ghost from the location should be sthealthed for 1 turn only
[2022-12-15 17:57:40] <FardHast> Is it even better if pot gave 2 same ones? Seems like a downside, cause it means less likely to get the one you want.
[2022-12-15 17:58:07] <%+dumbgamerboy> J alex really wants 3 damage twice though
[2022-12-15 17:58:51] <shopherodobrasil> 6 times no draw
[2022-12-15 17:58:51] <%UmbraDeath> rogue needs a legendary minion that puts a random concoction in your hand for each concoction you've played this game
[2022-12-15 17:58:52] <Dannyvinicius> two of the same is even stronger LUL
[2022-12-15 17:58:59] <Dannyvinicius> two mana sprint

[2022-12-15 18:00:08] <FardHast> see? you'll have a chance for a sprint, but less chance for a draw 2

[2022-12-15 19:25:51] <Chidory994> is ghost strike better than the 1 mana dredge, combo: draw 1 card

[2022-12-15 19:33:18] <%Dijoxin> must say, the design for patchwerk is really in keeping with his wow mechanics
[2022-12-15 19:33:21] <zmears> theoritcally there is a first card i guess
[2022-12-15 19:33:50] <zmears> @Dijoxin I agree he made me want to cry in WoW too I think
[2022-12-15 19:34:12] <%+dumbgamerboy> well a lot of classic cards are just identical or slightly modified wow tcg cards
[2022-12-15 19:34:26] <%$10TC> blood reno probably
[2022-12-15 19:34:29] <%+dumbgamerboy> so you'd have to go back at least that far to find out what the first card was

[2022-12-15 19:38:32] <%+dumbgamerboy> deathstalker rexxar is one of the only cards they've ever kept the effect evergreen on

[2022-12-15 19:44:04] <zmears> infinite malygos my god this is a tuber
[2022-12-15 19:44:10] <%+dumbgamerboy> white eyes was such a cool card
[2022-12-15 19:44:30] <Harps__> you can win the game with that alone
[2022-12-15 19:44:35] <Chidory994> improved arcane missiles @danehearth
[2022-12-15 19:44:40] <KingOfBarbies> flamestrike, fireball, frostbolt, frost nova
[2022-12-15 19:44:54] <KingOfBarbies> and missiles
[2022-12-15 19:45:07] <souljazz> and poly
[2022-12-15 19:45:26] <+Guidoxten> i think he gives 1 mana iceblock?
[2022-12-15 19:45:35] <+Guidoxten> or im tripping
[2022-12-15 19:45:38] <KingOfBarbies> there's no ice block
[2022-12-15 19:46:05] <zmears> dang this reminded me that I miss poly in standard
[2022-12-15 19:46:29] <%+dumbgamerboy> jellyfish poly is a better card
[2022-12-15 19:46:44] <KingOfBarbies> starfish is mostly better for standard since d/r rogue is the main culprit
[2022-12-15 19:46:52] <zmears> yeah but I like the funny sheep
[2022-12-15 19:47:09] <%+dumbgamerboy> 🐑

[2022-12-15 19:47:42] <Harps__> the polymorph sheep part was probably the only good bit of the warcraft movie
[2022-12-15 19:48:15] <zmears> @Harps__  dont remind me of that movie oh god
[2022-12-15 19:50:26] <DieLabtecMan> Concotions turned out to be pretty good
[2022-12-15 19:52:47] <fntstc_raconteur> does cloak of shadows's stealth 'until your next turn' not stay through time warp extra turns?

[2022-12-15 19:55:22] <SnarfPHD> @danehearth Have you thought about using Scourge Illusionist, Kobold Illusionist, and Masked Reveler to make a rogue deck that has an unkillable board?
[2022-12-15 19:56:13] <+Ipreferbagels> so true
[2022-12-15 19:56:44] <SnarfPHD> I thought about crafting it but wanted your thoughts on it.

[2022-12-15 20:05:50] <zmears> yeah i've learnt that the hard way too, guess its becaise you have to add the card before it transforms

[2022-12-15 20:09:39] <PeYceBall> I need to kill brann... Well killing the opponent also works EZ
[2022-12-15 20:09:54] <blatancy1989> Really cool the synergies. Good job
[2022-12-15 20:11:00] <blatancy1989> What does mean Manathrist? Means that the effect is done when you have 4 mana?
[2022-12-15 20:11:08] <%+dumbgamerboy> did reynad's game ever come out? he swore it would be this year
[2022-12-15 20:11:15] <shopherodobrasil> loatheb will be good against him
[2022-12-15 20:11:19] <blatancy1989> Thank you sir
[2022-12-15 20:11:45] <%Mikazaan> Its like the omega cards from boomsday
[2022-12-15 20:11:53] <%+PrimoBrand> manathrist is also not a battlecry
[2022-12-15 20:12:18] <shopherodobrasil> scabs good
[2022-12-15 20:12:19] <blatancy1989> @PrimoBrand YEP, is just the effect. Not countable as a battlecry.
[2022-12-15 20:12:43] <blatancy1989> @PrimoBrand The text flavor should be: Manathrist and Battlecry: Bla bla bla
[2022-12-15 20:12:56] <%+PrimoBrand> people seems to misunderstood that @blatancy1989
[2022-12-15 20:13:08] <blatancy1989> @PrimoBrand yep

[2022-12-15 20:22:45] <%+PrimoBrand> OG Nemsy is fine. dunno why she gets 10+ Warlock skins
[2022-12-15 20:23:13] <shopherodobrasil> my hand is always bad against this disco lock
[2022-12-15 20:24:11] <%$ToaTawlee> does disco lock beat even shaman?
[2022-12-15 20:24:26] <%+PrimoBrand> yes, it's favored
[2022-12-15 20:24:30] <%$ToaTawlee> oof
[2022-12-15 20:24:36] <%$ToaTawlee> thanks
[2022-12-15 20:24:50] <%+PrimoBrand> worst matchup is drawing badly as discolock tbh
[2022-12-15 20:24:56] <%+PrimoBrand> LUL
[2022-12-15 20:24:58] <%$ToaTawlee> LUL
[2022-12-15 20:25:02] <luciusXIV> he has cata
[2022-12-15 20:25:09] <+Eggs_Benny> I built a Reno Renethal Control Bomb Warrior list with the intention of countering discolock, and im 3-0 against them so far. Such a good feeling to shut them down :D
[2022-12-15 20:25:53] <Rasshidan> He discarded 1 Cata last turn
[2022-12-15 20:26:07] <%+PrimoBrand> by the time you start bombing they you should be almost dead. good that it is working for you @eggs_benny
[2022-12-15 20:26:34] <+Eggs_Benny> bombs are for when theyve drawn theyre whole deck, and armor, reno, and board clears survive the bursts
[2022-12-15 20:26:43] <%+PrimoBrand> barrage is such a over the top card for the deck
[2022-12-15 20:26:51] <Rasshidan> Swindle into Step
[2022-12-15 20:27:12] <Rasshidan> monkaS
[2022-12-15 20:27:39] <%$Takkon> I really hope they ban tome, or just nerf imp finally.  I even see this a ton in gold rank.
[2022-12-15 20:28:01] <%$Takkon> I think its time for imp to get the apprentice treament
[2022-12-15 20:28:07] <%$Takkon> its only a matter of time
[2022-12-15 20:28:09] <+Eggs_Benny> what would a good imp nerf be? It would still be good at 2 mana
[2022-12-15 20:28:18] <%$Takkon> 4 mana
[2022-12-15 20:29:11] <%UmbraDeath> triHmm
[2022-12-15 20:30:08] <luciusXIV> prep prep coin is better
[2022-12-15 20:30:08] <zmears> imp will be give your discard minions +1 attack
[2022-12-15 20:30:30] <whiteworm20> @UmbraDeath Hello djinL
[2022-12-15 20:30:35] <%+PrimoBrand> tome nerf/ban might make the deck more fair, same for barrage. the biggest problem the deck has right now is the amount of pressure + board clearing it can do so it just beat control and aggro easily
[2022-12-15 20:30:47] <%+PrimoBrand> copying out barrage makes the deck nuts
[2022-12-15 20:31:13] <%$Takkon> gutting imp is future proof.  Banning tome is just a bandaid.
[2022-12-15 20:31:15] <+mattkk12> @Eggs_Benny the first card you discard each turn, draw a card
[2022-12-15 20:32:01] <+DontRead_0> !decklist
[2022-12-15 20:32:01] <@^Nightbot> DontRead_0, do you mean !dicklist or !ducklist? Kappa
[2022-12-15 20:32:55] <luciusXIV> why only one shadowcaster ?
[2022-12-15 20:33:02] <%+PrimoBrand> yeah but... in a world where both tome and hand of guldan exists, I dunno if tackling the imp is the best approach
[2022-12-15 20:33:44] <%+PrimoBrand> it would slows down a bit, but not that much i think
[2022-12-15 20:33:50] <+mattkk12> @PrimoBrand how is tome the problem though?
[2022-12-15 20:34:12] <shopherodobrasil> poor mage
[2022-12-15 20:34:26] <%+PrimoBrand> its a problem by copying out hand of guldan + barrages @mattkk12
[2022-12-15 20:34:48] <%DevilDestiny> @PrimoBrand value of getting discard cards effects and reusing them. so you actually not discarding stuff but shuffling your hand
[2022-12-15 20:34:55] <+mattkk12> @PrimoBrand so you just described how other cards are the issue
[2022-12-15 20:35:10] <%+PrimoBrand> ?
[2022-12-15 20:35:22] <luciusXIV> he only has 1 lotheb in hand surely a rougue cant generate more
[2022-12-15 20:35:33] <+Eggs_Benny> @Eggs_Benny I like that, not a crippling nerf but solves the problem
[2022-12-15 20:35:50] <%+dumbgamerboy> daneHappy
