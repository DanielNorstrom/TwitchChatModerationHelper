With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse.

And its faith is an instrument of deception. It is naught but a cobweb of lies. To believe in Eorzea is to believe in nothing. In Eorzea, the beast tribes often summon gods to fight in their stead--though your comrades only rarely respond in kind. Which is strange, is it not?

[2022-12-21 16:02:27] <%petterikettunen> You can say that I was born to be a Twitch channel mod. I catch a glimpse of copypasta, the adrenaline starts pumping. A whiff of drama, I snap into duty. My streamer calls for a chat ban, I erase that motherfucker from the history books of this channel. There is no !command I won‚Äôt code, no timeout I won‚Äôt give, no Twitch laws I won‚Äôt overlook, and no order I won‚Äôt obey to make my streamer happy. And if you become his problem, well, I‚Äôm sorry to say that I‚Äôll become yours.

[2022-12-21 16:02:34] <kanikwami> Nor is this unknown to your masters. Which prompts the question: Why do they cling to these false deities? What drives even men of learning--even the great Louisoix--to grovel at their feet? The answer? Your masters lack the strength to do otherwise! For the world of man to mean anything, man must own the world. To this end, he hath fought ever to raise himself through conflict--to grow rich through conquest.

[2022-12-21 16:03:28] <kanikwami> Knowing this, but a single path is open to the impotent ruler--that of false worship. A path which leads to enervation and death. Only a man of power can rightly steer the course of civilization. And in this land of creeping mendacity, that one truth will prove its salvation. Come, champion of Eorzea, face me! Your defeat shall serve as proof of my readiness to rule! It is only right that I should take your realm. For none among you has the power to stop me!

[2022-12-21 16:12:39] <%petterikettunen> The FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.
[2022-12-21 16:12:41] <%petterikettunen> The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

[2022-12-21 17:08:05] <lucas9322> maybe ask for something for when you wake up
[2022-12-21 17:08:05] <%HemilyTiger> Before I got diagnosed I really struggled with sleeping, where I'd be up for 24 hours straight, then sleep for 20 hours straight, and still be tired as fark when I got up.
[2022-12-21 17:08:07] <%+LittleHelper> Best Pringles Flavour? Kinda tossing between Sour Cream & Onion and Salt & Vinegar.
[2022-12-21 17:08:22] <%8bitkitten> I love salt & vinegar and pickle chips

[2022-12-21 17:08:40] <%Boaty7321> I've always thought of crepes as sweet

[2022-12-21 17:08:52] <Uncle_Zwamp> Well you can fill crepes with what you want
[2022-12-21 17:09:05] <%HemilyTiger> I was 34 when I got diagnosed with ADHD, and was told because of ADHD I've technically never been fully rested.
[2022-12-21 17:09:13] <%raddiation_elf> Classic flavor pringles are better for me, can't tolerate the others
[2022-12-21 17:09:14] <%onigirilastfan> if you have adhd. drink an energy that will calm you down and help you sleep

[2022-12-21 17:09:23] <%Boaty7321> Yep, ADHD is one of those things where you think you're normal until you find out you're kind of not
[2022-12-21 17:09:35] <%Pralius> Savory crepes got me through college. best food truck on campus
[2022-12-21 17:09:36] <%SmaViking> this chat is making me wonder if getting adhd meds would actually help my sleep too
[2022-12-21 17:09:37] <ChrisKriegs> oh, I could use one of those for small model paint bottles
[2022-12-21 17:09:38] <%luckyblock98twitch> I once had two sweet things in a crepe, probably strawberries and blueberries, and was out cold
[2022-12-21 17:09:40] <KimiVerdure> That'd be me with autism and a few other things. My partner is also autistic, and finally finding someone else who does the same things, and realising why, really helped
[2022-12-21 17:09:44] <%+LittleHelper> Had my diagnoses done young and things really didn't improve the more that was known
[2022-12-21 17:09:46] <Uncle_Zwamp> Are you guys on adhd drugs? adderall/ritalin?
[2022-12-21 17:09:47] <$Ace_Headhunter_> I wish i could get diagnose but it's too expensive and i know there is something wrong with me.

[2022-12-21 17:11:28] <Uncle_Zwamp> I was 38 when I was diagnosed, had to pay $4k to see a specialist to get my diagnosis. Will start my drug trials in january, I sure hope it works, cause at the moment I am just a husk that cant do anything.
[2022-12-21 17:11:32] <%raddiation_elf> @Sien_Krisblin Seems like a generalized problem everywhere
[2022-12-21 17:11:33] <GiggleSquidi> Same here
[2022-12-21 17:11:35] <Manamari> @Ace_Headhunter_ same... I know there's -something- going on with my brain (probably multiple things, tbh), but testing for adults is obscenely expensive
[2022-12-21 17:11:42] <%$chanman691839> Hi chat
[2022-12-21 17:11:45] <%+LittleHelper> Being diagnosed for stuff here just feels like they slap on a gold star, get told 'you tried' and just having the world wait for you to curl up and pass.

[2022-12-21 17:12:14] <%HemilyTiger> As a Norwegian they're progressive in trying to figure stuff out, but as I went to school in the 90s... and the teachers were near retirement age at my school... my ADHD went undiscovered.
[2022-12-21 17:12:21] <KimiVerdure> The worst I found with being later diagnosed is suddenly being offered help and support, and feeling like you can't take it, because you've gone without it up until now, and you feel guilty about taking it.
[2022-12-21 17:12:22] <%Mastermegabyte> and you have to be careful on how you approach your doctor about your suspicion of having undiagnosed ADHD. I already had one or two phychs just dismiss my claims. Saying that it is depression. I call it "why not both?"
[2022-12-21 17:12:30] <%Pralius> sympathy is unfortunately lacking in modern medacine

[2022-12-21 17:12:55] <Manamari> I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid, but at some point adults decided I "grew out of it" and I just believed them, but as I've gotten older I've realized that was probably bullshit
[2022-12-21 17:13:06] <%onigirilastfan> well the adhd meds is a profitable narcotic
[2022-12-21 17:13:12] <%+LittleHelper> I wish people would stop pretending they cared, stalling for time and instead just told me straight up they didn't know how to help.
[2022-12-21 17:13:20] <%raddiation_elf> Medicine protocols also make pacient-doctor relationships non empathical
[2022-12-21 17:13:20] <%Boaty7321> Yeah, our health system is pretty decent, but sometimes you don't get a medical professional that cares until you go through a few of them
[2022-12-21 17:13:23] <%onigirilastfan> alot of people would fake it to sell it

[2022-12-21 17:15:11] <%onigirilastfan> adhd is more chemical than mental lol.

[2022-12-21 17:15:40] <%+soggybiscuit00> with being diagnosed so late it sucks because atm it is just in the in-between of schooling and the real world. so it feels like im just wasting time away when i dont know what to do with myself lol
[2022-12-21 17:15:46] <%onigirilastfan> Ritalin causes stunted growth loss of appetite depression and hallucinations

[2022-12-21 17:17:28] <Manamari> @onigirilastfan idk if they were aware of that stuff back when I was taking it, but out of those, it might've been loss of appetite that my parents were concerned with

[2022-12-21 17:19:26] <Manamari> because it didn't start until I moved to one of the worst places for allergies in the country
[2022-12-21 17:19:29] <%ichigo1692> Yup, and tbh I wouldn't mind since I've been having to deal with it for years
[2022-12-21 17:19:38] <%HemilyTiger> I only recently discovered that when it's quiet there's a constant sound in my ears, I don't like quiet so I'd not really noticed... but might explain why I don't like quiet.

[2022-12-21 17:23:15] <%kyulen742> i've had Haruka's streams on while i've slept the last few nights, it's way more comfy than i expected

[2022-12-21 17:23:18] <%HemilyTiger> I think I'm also undiagnosed on the autism spectrum, so I struggle with social interactions, so interviews are just... weird and awkward.
[2022-12-21 17:23:22] <%Spikee439> I don't have experience in working hotels but my management experience in retail helps me....I guess
[2022-12-21 17:23:27] <%blitzart15> Hiya guys hows your days

[2022-12-21 17:25:05] <+Indeliblerock> I always like to view interviews as conversations, it‚Äôs much easier to make a good impression that way

[2022-12-21 17:25:57] <+Tweed7315> My solution to imposter syndrome is to know everyone else is an imposter too.
[2022-12-21 17:26:13] <%kyulen742> i always feel like i'm bullshitting everything at my job, i don't ever completely feel like i know what i'm doing, even though i've worked at the place for years

[2022-12-21 17:28:44] <%+LittleHelper> Did a short trial with a place many years ago - they put me in a position I had to tell them I was suited for or comfortable with so the manager gave me a toothbrush, told me to get on my hands and knees and clean dishwashers on the shop floor whilst the place was open for business. Even with just a toothbrush I was good but support was telling me I was being abused. Now I have trust issues.
[2022-12-21 17:28:46] <Manamari> I cut it way too close with getting Christmas gifts for my parents... they're set to get here on Friday and we're supposed to get a hard freeze, so there might be delays

[2022-12-21 17:29:05] <Manamari> they'll understand if the stuff gets here late, but I'd still feel bad
[2022-12-21 17:29:08] <%megalodonwolf001> Speaking of work your voice is a major help. I do hope that you can get to sleep soon.
[2022-12-21 17:29:12] <%HemilyTiger> holy carp... the prices on that train, they paid as much for a private room on the train as a Big Mac costs here in Norway...

[2022-12-21 17:30:20] <%$laseraces> my position has changed managers like 4 times over the past few years, really lucky the current one is the "as long as shit gets done" mindset
[2022-12-21 17:30:20] <%$Asulex1> haruchiHeart
[2022-12-21 17:30:21] <%macadamiannut_joe> Usually the people that want power are the ones that are also gonna abuse it

[2022-12-21 17:30:33] <%Boaty7321> I much prefer to be a worker bee, am not interested in being a manager
[2022-12-21 17:30:38] <%raddiation_elf> Sadly people treat others as obstacles, competition and numbers
[2022-12-21 17:30:38] <+Indeliblerock> If your nerves scream, that‚Äôs a good reason to leave

[2022-12-21 17:30:47] <KimiVerdure> My old job destroyed my mental health, I had to do the manager job, even though I was not manager. I won best in the region for my title, but it just soul destroyed me, and I had to leave. I was good at it, but it was too much to handle for long periods of time. Plus on my feet 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

[2022-12-21 17:30:52] <%8bitkitten> yeah I've worked jobs that are way too strict about that, like, as a customer I don't give a shit, I understand if soeone just needs a moment in the back to check something
[2022-12-21 17:30:52] <%HemilyTiger> I've been lucky with folks I worked for, my old boss at the paint shop still calls me now and then to check how I'm doing, and it's almost 10 years since I worked there.

[2022-12-21 17:31:53] <%+SelphiusAeterna> i 100% welcome robots taking over the stressful mind numbing soul succking  jobs
[2022-12-21 17:32:03] <%Mellisbaker> I think everyone needs at least 1 year in the service industry so they get some insight on customers and how to treat people in general. Too many entitled karens out there that think stuff just magically works out there.
[2022-12-21 17:32:07] <%kyulen742> i work retail, it sucks and i would have no problem with robots taking over my job. I'd much rather work a job where i don't have to be around people so often IRL

[2022-12-21 17:33:25] <KimiVerdure> We were supposed to be a soft selling company. My manager was nice but spread thing,a nd the assistant manager was a nightmare. I was taught to lock up, and the first day I did it I was completely on my own with 3 new staff, and had only been there a few months myself.
[2022-12-21 17:33:26] <%raddiation_elf> @Mellisbaker ....Does not help some cultures keep making people mentally ill and don't get treatment, so then the customers are the anger release treatment

[2022-12-21 17:34:59] <%Boaty7321> Bottom line, the corporate world generally doesn't give a shit about humans, thus it's a good idea to get very good friends/family members around you to keep your spirits up
[2022-12-21 17:35:00] <%onigirilastfan> not many know about steel
[2022-12-21 17:35:01] <+Indeliblerock> Corporations never want to pay for the actual position, I work in software development and I see it constantly that people take on positions that aren‚Äôt paid what they‚Äôre worth

[2022-12-21 17:35:18] <%Xzaven> not sure if this only applies to where I live, but the most common cause here for quitting a job is the boss/manager, with 2/3 people saying that was the cause. That tells you a lot
[2022-12-21 17:35:20] <%HemilyTiger> you often hear weird stories from work life too, like the one about a guy who applied for a job as a coder, but got declined as they wanted someone with 5 years of experience in a specific coding language, the guy who applied invented the coding language 2 years ago.

[2022-12-21 17:44:13] <%+LachesisArkwight> But I guess similar.
[2022-12-21 17:44:39] <%+Sien_Krisblin> I couldnt stomach Natto. Apparently its a genetic thing, similar to corriander (cilantro) tasting like soap to some people
[2022-12-21 17:44:48] <+wolfishly__> It has a soy sauce like flavor, but the texture is most people's complaints

[2022-12-21 17:46:10] <%Mellisbaker> So I only got one complaint about aussie food. Musk sticks, WHY! They are so gross, like stale fondant icing.
[2022-12-21 17:46:20] <lucas9322> so it's like vanilla
[2022-12-21 17:46:22] <ragingbull214> I hate grilled cheese

[2022-12-21 17:46:51] <%Boaty7321> Vegemite is one of those things that is both an acquired taste, and a small amount goes a loooong way
[2022-12-21 17:46:53] <Manamari> yeah, i have texture issues with some foods... i think the most notable ones are raw tomatoes and meatloaf

[2022-12-21 17:47:27] <+wolfishly__> Soy sauce is just fermented soy beans in bins. Natto is soy sauce fermented in wheat. The goop is the wheat.

[2022-12-21 18:09:13] <dragonfriend7738> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch.
[2022-12-21 18:09:18] <%Pralius> HUHH

[2022-12-21 18:09:33] <dragonfriend7738> But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind.

[2022-12-21 20:51:27] <Lamango> Ash wouldn't know what sex is.
[2022-12-21 20:51:31] <%wolfpackmn> I love the blue tint in her hair so much

[2022-12-21 20:51:47] <%thekingrulz9090> Ash is super dense LOL
[2022-12-21 20:51:49] <DiabloHydra> I mean Ash snd Serena kissed in X and Y, no cap
[2022-12-21 20:51:50] <%arbiter58> The only problem with Riko being Ash's daughter is how many people fighting over who the mom is.
[2022-12-21 20:51:51] <KimiVerdure> Her hair clip is the symbol from Ash's original hat, which is a cute touch
[2022-12-21 20:51:54] <%nic1984kekwfathead> ash is too dense to notice girls

[2022-12-21 20:52:05] <%Lee_The_Limey> Ash would only make a child if his pokemon befitted from it somehow Kappa
[2022-12-21 20:52:05] <%$Northstar690> Ash is denser than a black hole crated by a gardivoir
[2022-12-21 20:52:05] <%YunruWithATopHat> I think Riko is Misty and May's daughter

[2022-12-21 20:53:05] <%nic1984kekwfathead> i hope ash gets a cameo or a going sway scene
[2022-12-21 20:53:07] <%scorcher117> @harukakaribu So I wasn‚Äôt fully paying attention, what were you saying about Ash before the pokemon league thing?
[2022-12-21 20:53:10] <DiabloHydra> Are Pikachu replacement in the new anime is Sprigatito apparently
[2022-12-21 20:53:11] <%CanadianEspeon> What if they made Eevee the mascot instead?
[2022-12-21 20:53:12] <%YunruWithATopHat> Eevee would make a cute mascot
[2022-12-21 20:53:15] <%Lee_The_Limey> I think they prob want a fresh mascot for Pokemon moving forward  too

While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch.
