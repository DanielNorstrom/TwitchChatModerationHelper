[2023-01-05 00:33:38] <%$iwerewolve> Quick, before barb gets here, anyone know about log-transformed dependent variables in linear regressions?
[2023-01-05 00:33:50] <%$yasarumit> I totally missed the entire rando, tell me he didn't finished it Sadge
[2023-01-05 00:34:21] <%PiemanIowa> Only has one soul and the vessel. He's continuing it tomorrow.
[2023-01-05 00:34:50] <@%$Kindredmsg> ^ will resume tomorrow in the morning stream
[2023-01-05 00:35:00] <%$yasarumit> Nice! Thanks barbLove So depending on tonight's game I can just say hi and go bye bye to watch the vod KEKLEO
[2023-01-05 00:35:27] <%$iwerewolve> I almost beat loop hero today NotLikeThis
[2023-01-05 00:35:36] <%$iwerewolve> The last 25% of that fourth act is brutal
[2023-01-05 00:35:37] <%$yasarumit> I assume it wouldn't be the first thing in the morning
[2023-01-05 00:35:48] <%$iwerewolve> @yasarumit first thing has been loop hero and romhacks lately
[2023-01-05 00:36:05] <@%$Kindredmsg> might be another moon magic night veiShrug
[2023-01-05 00:36:10] <%$yasarumit> Or maybe Crossword and then rando Jebaited
[2023-01-05 00:36:35] <%$iwerewolve> "Moon. Magic.... Do I need to set down my controller and get a beer?" Best puzzle solve ever
[2023-01-05 00:36:54] <%$yasarumit> That shit was so funny I'm so glad I was there live
[2023-01-05 00:37:03] <%$Nytdreamer> That makes me sad. I was hoping the rando would be on the weekend. Can't watch it aweekday mornings FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-05 00:37:14] <%$iwerewolve> @yasarumit Me too, he almost said it sooooo many times but just missed it KEKW
[2023-01-05 00:37:34] <%$iwerewolve> @Nytdreamer VOD?  It's usually SMWRPG music so it isn't deleted
[2023-01-05 00:37:54] <%$yasarumit> Tbf it is totally normal for a a casual guy like Smoke who isn't even playing Mario at all usually, let alone the rom hacks
[2023-01-05 00:38:26] <%$Nytdreamer> Eh, just prefer to watch live. Plus gamba barbBet
[2023-01-05 00:38:31] <%$iwerewolve> @yasarumit I think he legit said "Lunar Magic" at one point talking about how romhacks are made and didn't put it together.  Tbf I couldn't have done it.
[2023-01-05 00:38:33] <%$yasarumit> Yeah I'm gonna watch today's vod and it's gonna be great apart from the urge of chatting Sadge
[2023-01-05 00:39:00] <%$iwerewolve> @yasarumit That's why I don't watch VODs, they remind me how alone we all are in life. Like looking at a society long gone

[2023-01-05 01:46:55] <LiLLMentaL> my 18 year old son plays rocket league, the skill cap is Much larger than I would have expected. there are some very difficult niche mechanics
[2023-01-05 01:47:00] <%Gruntiatus> if you can turn your brain off and enjoy fall guys, you can definitely have a good time playing rocket league

[2023-01-05 02:58:39] <thorggrim83> The more Mountains/forests/rivers does increase ur odds on the boss fight. U dont need to fill ur map with spawners

[2023-01-05 03:20:47] <%corignis> @Zw1ggy is that the development that would have given us the ranged class?
[2023-01-05 03:20:47] <%+Glick_Wick> this is a Russian dev, and Steam has halted payments to all devs as part of sanctions, so yeah this game is dead for now

[2023-01-05 03:21:38] <%$Zw1ggy> @corignis afaik it was gonna be a big update, they went from a patch to a full blown update. So I would guess 1-2 more classes

[2023-01-05 03:50:23] <%Antnydoom> @Antnydoom thats so funny, i feel the exact same way - i think its the nostalgia of seinfeld for me
[2023-01-05 03:50:25] <%Rosisson> I never watched any episode tbh (and I'm 28 before someone calls me a kid) it's also a lot less prevalent outside the US
[2023-01-05 03:50:29] <%$ChooobaFuccstick> My girlfriend hates it, and honestly it’s a bit of a red flag
[2023-01-05 03:50:29] <dracorosa_> The older I got the funnier sienfled became for me
[2023-01-05 03:50:31] <%Kingsgrave_> Ive tried to watch seinfeld but I never really got into it. Maybe I just missed out on growing up with it. I prefer curb.
[2023-01-05 03:50:32] <%$GlaceonYo> Skeleman level is too good

[2023-01-05 03:51:40] <BahamutOdin> “Not that’s there’s anything wrong with that.”
[2023-01-05 03:51:44] <%$anthor_of_rhoads> it holds up pretty well but Curb is an improvement in almost every way. Larry > Jerry

[2023-01-05 03:53:06] <%umbra00> i think malcolm in the middle is a good one for all ages, young people connect with malcom or dewey, teens with reese or francis, and adults with hal and lois
[2023-01-05 03:53:07] <%nasagivii> @dalesiov17 as a kid i didnt get it, but it wasnt a bad show. I liked kramer cause he was so out there, but as i grew up and started to understand it i loved it
[2023-01-05 03:53:13] <%eternally_serene> I just rewatched the whole series and the humor still stands. My wife just actually bought the kramer painting as a joke for for christmas
[2023-01-05 03:53:14] <PrinceKaro> just making the boss stronger by waiting
[2023-01-05 03:53:19] <ballpoint_man> I personally think Seinfeld is a little overrated. It's funny, but not fantastic. Of 90's sitcoms, I liked Frazier more.

[2023-01-05 03:55:03] <%MetalExplosions> watchtowers set up around the camp really help with stopping the boss stuff popping up, and with killing the boss itself
[2023-01-05 03:55:04] <salemthecat_> @ItzEcks Zelda 2 is definitely divisive-- you either love it or hate it

[2023-01-05 04:01:08] <+TheRastopher> I like Zelda 2. I would actually be okay with a new side scrolling Zelda game.
[2023-01-05 04:01:08] <+BairnONessie> enemy spawning too, though that was any game of that gen.

[2023-01-05 04:01:35] <Varsidian> a lot of people mentioned different legitimate reasons, seems to be plenty but I think it's a case of the FromSoft situation of Sekiro and Dark Souls

[2023-01-05 04:01:54] <%+cjbarb7> Like banjo kazooie nuts and bolts, it aint a banjo game but could survive on a different IP
[2023-01-05 04:01:58] <%Rocky210420> honestly people are still stuck on the difference of gameplay type the first game and to Zelda 2
[2023-01-05 04:01:59] <%ye11owTV> people said the same thing about Spore vs Darkspore. Darkspore had completely different gameplay, but it was a fine game

[2023-01-05 04:02:04] <%$Xandarius> Zelda 2 was made without the knowledge that Zelda 1 would be the template of other zelda games.

[2023-01-05 04:02:42] <%Whyeverso> It was different from Zelda 1 in a way that Zelda 1 fans didn't like, basically. There were already a lot of side-scrolling hack and slash games so it seemed like it had lost some of its charm.

[2023-01-05 04:42:11] <%AttackTeam_> not really, the closest i've seen to this is a random game on some games website but it's a lot more watered down

[2023-01-05 04:54:27] <%$azrael_dr> It depends on the loop that generates
[2023-01-05 04:54:37] <%AttackTeam_> some of the secret bosses are really specific
[2023-01-05 04:54:37] <%MadHellaLikely> @BarbarousKing im pretty sure theres tile combos you havent done yet

[2023-01-05 04:54:53] <%Kraelan> The bonuses from the river stack on a single tile so squiggling your rivers gets you more.

[2023-01-05 04:57:51] <%RubTheDucky> He allowed himself to be killed by humans because of his sympathy for them.
[2023-01-05 04:57:51] <%Khatun_> so true
[2023-01-05 04:57:52] <%$cinemario> Omega tried to become Sigma but he became Beta instead

[2023-01-05 04:58:06] <%CS_Hague> Oh man, you are missing out
[2023-01-05 04:58:06] <GuyMcBrofist> A human killed god and that pissed him off so he decided to unmake everything
[2023-01-05 04:58:08] <Mr_indieperson> you should try it
[2023-01-05 04:58:09] <%$udeechee_> macawKojima
[2023-01-05 04:58:12] <%CS_Hague> That game is a masterpiece
[2023-01-05 04:58:12] <%Dante_Draco> TLDR: God made everything. Some scrub got scared, and tried to stab him. God was like Okay, and died. Then as dead god decided to destroy everything. You kill Dead god he goes back to being alive.

[2023-01-05 04:58:36] <%rabidwombat311> the secret bosses are not intuitive

[2023-01-05 16:24:00] <%CarbonAxiom> @darkapocalyptica When the game first came out he didn't think it would make for a good randomizer, but the way the ER randomizer was designed means that you need to find all the Great Runes to beat the game so it's more like DS1 randomizer

[2023-01-05 16:27:36] <%CarbonAxiom> @oreo_cadester It's very different from the other Souls games. ER experience doesn't help at all with it. I think if you play any of the Dark Souls games you would find it a bit easier than Elden Ring overall

[2023-01-05 16:59:29] <salemthecat_> @BarbarousKing the romans stole the greek gods from the greek and just reappropriated it as their own

[2023-01-05 16:59:30] <%Vbraille> Mormonism is polytheistic. They believe in the trinity as equal gods. I know it’s not hugely popular, but it’s western and it’s there

[2023-01-05 16:59:45] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> The Romans took syncretization very seriously. A lot of what we currently think of as Roman gods were not originally Roman
[2023-01-05 16:59:45] <%$lazerhawkerotica> They absorbed a lot of local religions as well
[2023-01-05 16:59:45] <%aewheros> They even identified the german/norse gods with the roman ones. Odin = Mercury

[2023-01-05 17:09:33] <%fight_this> when you play through elden ring you really wonder
[2023-01-05 17:09:33] <ObadiahTheSlim> Dark Souls 1 had so many connections between the different areas that you wouldn't really get if you could just teleport like in the later ones.
[2023-01-05 17:09:37] <albanaster> the worst example of that is the one outside of Gwyndolins boss fight
[2023-01-05 17:09:37] <baronh2o> dark souls 1 would have been better had it been polished and finished post Anor Londo.
[2023-01-05 17:09:38] <%Buflen> i liked that it forced me to walk around, i learned the map better, compared to DS3
[2023-01-05 17:09:39] <%PonysPlace> I DO like that they hold it back until after andor londo though

[2023-01-05 17:09:52] <%Azur85> Just a bonfire in New Londo would be good

[2023-01-05 17:09:57] <%+thedaringpastry> Did anyone see the new Dark Souls 3 mod Archthrones 15 min video that just got released yesterday?
[2023-01-05 17:09:59] <%Hlantian> Bonfire rando doesn't sound too hard to make, you'd just need to preset a bunch of locations bonfires could spawn in, but idk
[2023-01-05 17:10:03] <%$BobAwesome> I still think Dark Souls 1 has the best world though.

[2023-01-05 17:10:27] <Skrzelik> Bonefire warp is an excuse for bad level design

[2023-01-05 17:10:33] <%PapaNug> i think the lack of warping bonfires was there to help guide the player to the right areas, without overwhelming the player

[2023-01-05 17:11:56] <%Michalcok> running back to just run back is stupid
[2023-01-05 17:11:56] <%+Chicken87> It is strange when devs start the game with a cool idea then never use it again
[2023-01-05 17:11:57] <Mush23> and then you forget your ring

[2023-01-05 17:13:19] <%+quelthalin> I'm pretty sure that going from O&S almost directly to Gwyn would improve DS1
[2023-01-05 17:13:19] <%Wonk0> thats an interesting sound
[2023-01-05 17:13:20] <%+Kristoph_Darkstorm> someones trying to bring the castle down
[2023-01-05 17:13:20] <%+GINandTyler> This game needs summons Kappa
[2023-01-05 17:13:21] <%$The_Mammon_Machine> Miyazaki took a risk with this game including the entire Mario RPG soundtrack but i think it paid off

[2023-01-05 17:13:33] <%Zombie_State> DS3 is backloaded
[2023-01-05 17:13:33] <%brandbool> except fire giant
[2023-01-05 17:13:34] <Spinjump19> the back half of DS3 is great
[2023-01-05 17:13:36] <%DeNarm> I feel like DS3 is better later on
[2023-01-05 17:13:37] <%zombiepatches> the last half of elden ring is the same boss form the first half x2
[2023-01-05 17:13:38] <%Acy37> I still feel like it's weaker towards the end
[2023-01-05 17:13:38] <%higHChloride> until the Elden Beast

[2023-01-05 17:13:40] <%MrMightyMouse> DS3 DLC was fantastic
[2023-01-05 17:13:41] <%Taazdingus> balance was a little shit towards the end
[2023-01-05 17:13:41] <%$GameFillip> sekiro frontloads some terrible shit and then gets awesome after chained ogre
[2023-01-05 17:13:41] <%Zombie_State> and Sekiro is very evenly spread
[2023-01-05 17:13:42] <%Taazdingus> still fun though
[2023-01-05 17:13:43] <%$Puikoko> Sekiro's back half - chef's kiss. Sekiro's front half - chef's kiss.
[2023-01-05 17:13:44] <%+Hyper_Snake> the end game difficulty spike in elden ring was dumb as hell
[2023-01-05 17:13:44] <%+Con_fusedDX> I thought the snow areas were less inspired in ER
[2023-01-05 17:13:44] <Varsidian> Moghs palace is absolute garbo
[2023-01-05 17:13:46] <%+Sayfritt> Elden beast best beast
[2023-01-05 17:13:46] <+WatermelonWillface> Bloodborne isn't front loaded
[2023-01-05 17:13:48] <Abrageen> SEKIRO was amazing
[2023-01-05 17:13:49] <%Buflen> last section in the snow is bad compared to the beginning
[2023-01-05 17:13:49] <%foryourhealth> Late game BB god tier

[2023-01-05 17:13:54] <%SmilezForMiles> I think the last few bosses in elden ring sucked
[2023-01-05 17:13:56] <%+rman500> the loch ness monster in ER was terrible
[2023-01-05 17:13:57] <%$reservoir_dawgs> There’s no bed of chaos in elden ring…it was honestly consistently great throughout
[2023-01-05 17:13:57] <%+dcboizero> it has to happen

[2023-01-05 17:14:05] <%+GaimeGuy> NIHIL
[2023-01-05 17:14:08] <%+Lord_Suiadan> Slave Knight Gale is one of my favorite From Bosses
[2023-01-05 17:14:08] <%$Eldarrok> Elden ring started to go a little down once you got to the fire giant
[2023-01-05 17:14:10] <ObadiahTheSlim> The way you just teleported to a new area after lighting the tree on fire was dumb as fuck and outta nowhere
[2023-01-05 17:14:12] <%Hlantian> I barely even notice the screen shake in souls, but in games like Celeste or Gungeon it makes the game unwatchable
[2023-01-05 17:14:12] <%$SelBadger> that area was so fucking miserable
[2023-01-05 17:14:13] <%DeNarm> DS3 DLC are great. the ringed city kiiiiicked my ass
[2023-01-05 17:14:14] <%bigern22> Most games are front loaded. Once you level up so much, it's generally not as good.

[2023-01-05 17:18:09] <%Whyeverso> Almost every FF game is its own world, there are very few sequels
[2023-01-05 17:18:09] <%$trevxor> It has a lot of relations to Ivalice, which is Final Fantasy Tactics and FF12

[2023-01-05 17:18:15] <%+Thrilllho> some fan theories connect some of the games together, but ff is an anthology series

[2023-01-05 17:18:19] <Mr_Reynolds15> The respiratory and breathing problems were pretty aweful
[2023-01-05 17:18:20] <%Cristophlyz> @barbarousking 14 is basically a giant MMO homage to all the Final Fantasy games, but the current expansion is leaning heavily into SNES Final Fantasy 2
[2023-01-05 17:18:21] <%Demagus3> @casteia there are implications that 7 and 10 are connected but that's way down the FF iceberg
[2023-01-05 17:18:22] <%$AsteriskX> 14 is
[2023-01-05 17:18:22] <%CarbonAxiom> @casteia And Vagrant Story also takes place in it apparently

[2023-01-05 17:18:30] <%renzokuken777> That's not exactly true, but most are their own story
[2023-01-05 17:18:30] <attackpengu> Kinda
[2023-01-05 17:18:30] <%OffDutyBill> 14 is set in a world that is at least similar to 12
[2023-01-05 17:18:31] <%PapaNug> very light connections if any. most aren't connected

[2023-01-05 17:55:25] <%BelAirJeff> From Wikipedia
[2023-01-05 17:55:26] <%Nymh79> Jhonen Vasquez, the guy that made Invader Zim, wrote a hilarious short comic about exactly that topic.
[2023-01-05 17:55:27] <%BelAirJeff> According to character writer Jimmy Palmiotti, “Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said “Every issue, I’m going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like, “Hey, what’s with the tits?” And that’s where they stopped. True story.”

[2023-01-05 18:02:38] <JakbenImble> Demon Souls combat has always looked very stiff and basic to me

[2023-01-05 18:02:39] <%+Technophile82> demon's souls remake was my first souls game. loved it
[2023-01-05 18:02:40] <%Acy37> agreed, the difficulty was a lot from the level design changes, and it's not like 1 is a walk in the park, you still needed to learn enemy locations
[2023-01-05 18:02:41] <+WatermelonWillface> ds1 is barely better than DeS imo

[2023-01-05 18:13:32] <%Vbraille> @odym82 That’s solidly incorrect. There are just as many subgenres to electronic music as there are genres of other music, and while some can sound similar, most are pretty distinctly different. Some sound like robots having sex, other is melodic and peaceful, some is high bpm, some is low and minimal. There’s a ton of variety within that umbrella

[2023-01-05 18:47:14] <@%deejay4am> @BelAirJeff I think this is from Metal Hellsinger, but Disturbed might have worked on some of the tracks yeah

[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <%Qwertyui606> alot of people probably never heard of the game
[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <riverhill86> This Metal Hellsinger soundtrack is really damn good
[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <%+QuartzB_> exactly why doom got stiffed too
[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> those people are wrong
[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <%theBonestorm> OOOOBANG 100% deserved that award
[2023-01-05 18:47:29] <%Miets> @saucyboy7 that game came out 6 years ago
[2023-01-05 18:47:32] <%renzokuken777> I think it didn't because the Game Awards are meaningless
[2023-01-05 18:47:32] <%AlinksPast> @Miets true
[2023-01-05 18:47:32] <%+jwowillo> Metal appeals to people who stopped developing mentally when they turned 14
[2023-01-05 18:47:32] <%Shiverwarp> Totally need to play BPM and Metal Hellsinger
[2023-01-05 18:47:33] <%Kaediryni> those ppl have good taste
[2023-01-05 18:47:33] <%$CleoChu> i feel like a lot of people didnt care much for that game in comparison

[2023-01-05 18:47:39] <%$saucyboy7> @Miets on steam awards
[2023-01-05 18:47:40] <%DeNarm> Metal has so much variety and so much to offer
[2023-01-05 18:47:40] <%JOHUshy> Metal is not for everyone
[2023-01-05 18:47:40] <%koozietime> to quote my mom "why do they have to yell?"
[2023-01-05 18:47:41] <%$Metallichepe> @selbadger this isn't him, this is dark tranquility singer
[2023-01-05 18:47:44] <%renzokuken777> and it's all a paid thing for AAA companies to shine
[2023-01-05 18:47:46] <%InfiniteLimit314> this metal sucks

[2023-01-05 18:47:49] <%+QuartzB_> i dont care for metal and even I can appreciate the album
[2023-01-05 18:47:50] <%dogemaster500> what soundtrack is this?
[2023-01-05 18:47:50] <%$The_Wollyhops> TBH Some metal does sound like someone gargling diarrhea
[2023-01-05 18:47:53] <%$EE02targz> Game wards is a joke full of recency bias
[2023-01-05 18:47:54] <%DregBasher> @jwowillo here's that attention you ordered
[2023-01-05 18:47:56] <%+coffeecorrupts> i have metalhead friends who only listen to metal. so there's some balance at least

[2023-01-05 18:48:11] <%Qu_Marsh> TMNT Shredders Revenge was another really good soundtrack from 2022 that should have gotten a nom
[2023-01-05 18:48:14] <%PAm5089> I love how metal is part of life in Finland
[2023-01-05 18:48:16] <%simms56> Metal in general hasn’t been mainstream marketable since like 2004 unfortunately. Was a MTV main feature  in the late 90s and early 2000s
[2023-01-05 18:48:16] <+texaspoontappa99> @coffeecorrupts what kind of metal?
[2023-01-05 18:48:16] <riverhill86> Sounds like Alissa White-Gluz's vocals
[2023-01-05 18:48:18] <%$SelBadger> @Metallichepe yeah, somebody asked if this was disturbed, I was pointing out it sounds nothing like them
[2023-01-05 18:48:19] <%OldSocksAndShoes> this metal is not great, but

[2023-01-05 18:48:21] <%steves_garage> the other problem is for people who don't know metal that well, its also hard to judge whats good and bad metal
[2023-01-05 18:48:21] <+BillJitsu_> love seeing Barb getting into metal

[2023-01-05 18:48:24] <%+Thrilllho> I think they need more categories for music awards. Like score and soundtrack as separate entries. Or maybe one for licensed music.
[2023-01-05 18:48:24] <%SevenF1re> kalameet has orange charred ring and final soul has bed of chaos

[2023-01-05 18:51:18] <+texaspoontappa99> @texaspoontappa99 Top  for me, they have maintained their sound without every album sounding the same like most hardcore bands.  Amazing accomplishment
[2023-01-05 18:51:19] <%$EE02targz> Jet Set radio is one of my favorite osts
[2023-01-05 18:51:20] <%doubled49> The Tony Hawk games got me into a ton of music when I was a kid

[2023-01-05 18:51:23] <%+agchee> J5 hasn't put out an album in like a decade. But the artists are still making stuff individually.
[2023-01-05 18:51:24] <+Carte422> Dragula was the All Star of video games

[2023-01-05 18:51:31] <%raphrodisiac_> Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 was similar for me in terms of introductions to music I liked a lot
[2023-01-05 18:51:32] <%staticmew> rob zombie had a few on Twisted Metal 3
[2023-01-05 18:51:32] <%Whyeverso> I first heard Dragula from Twisted Metal Black I think

[2023-01-05 19:50:18] <Toast_with_some_cinnamon> is ragnarok really that much more okay?

[2023-01-05 19:54:21] <%Joypen> it is
[2023-01-05 19:54:21] <%Azur85> ER is so confusing
[2023-01-05 19:54:21] <%blueskytreb82> Elden Ring fall damage is arbitrary
[2023-01-05 19:54:22] <lokeil_> fall damage in ds1 is pretty good
[2023-01-05 19:54:22] <%+penguinfarm> ER is pretty forgiving, but it's either no damage or you die
[2023-01-05 19:54:23] <%alucard835> can farm all those souls OOOO

[2023-01-05 19:54:27] <%+Lord_Suiadan> Elden Ring fall damage is inconsistent
[2023-01-05 19:54:27] <Prime_Globular> not very linear
[2023-01-05 19:54:28] <%+MentallyInept> 0 to 100 real quick
[2023-01-05 19:54:31] <%shamusyea> this looks like a cheese place to farm souls
[2023-01-05 19:54:32] <trickeyfish> DS2 is great. I love it
[2023-01-05 19:54:32] <Verniy> elden ring fall damage feels jank because the length between "no damage" and "dead" is so small
[2023-01-05 19:54:32] <%HeyMisterJack> catJAM
[2023-01-05 19:54:33] <%zombiepatches> lol, its not a ghost that takes your soul when you fall 6 but not 5 feet

[2023-01-05 19:54:35] <%+LuvaHiney> When I first saw this game, I thought it was Elden Ring.. so similar

[2023-01-05 19:54:43] <%Azur85> kratosJuice
[2023-01-05 19:54:43] <%Seda_Give> The scale in which you take damage but dont die in EldenRing is like 3 inches
[2023-01-05 19:54:45] <trickeyfish> I know, I'm one of the few
[2023-01-05 19:54:45] <%SomeRagamuffin> Elden Ring screwed up by skipping straight from 50% damage to instant death
[2023-01-05 19:54:46] <%vesipera> Worst was that they changed the way you slide down ladders in DS2, made me drop into my death multiple times in the beginning
[2023-01-05 19:54:46] <%acaran_> Because ER has super small range between 0 fall damage and length. Its like 5 meters.

[2023-01-05 19:54:54] <%saigio> 50 feet is fine, 50 feet and one inch is lethal
[2023-01-05 19:54:55] <%+KaladinCos> the fall damage when you do a mid air jump with torrent makes no sense

[2023-01-05 19:54:56] <%owoWobo> at least you have the cat ring in ER Kappa
[2023-01-05 19:54:57] <%thejumpingmouse> Your dex determines fall damage so it changes over the course of the game, making estimating damage difficult
[2023-01-05 19:54:57] <%Solghettoguy> one would think it would improve..... it did not
[2023-01-05 19:54:59] <%Mr_Panda> makes me think of Godskin apostles

[2023-01-05 20:22:20] <%SinfulC> Sekiro feels a bit slower and more rhythmic than DS3, but that's not exactly a souls game.
[2023-01-05 20:22:21] <%HelmsDeepnest> Eldener Ring
[2023-01-05 20:22:21] <%+carrwreq> Demon Souls doesn't fall  into the category?
[2023-01-05 20:22:21] <KOOLSM0KE> do you think the bosses feel clunkier or the actual character?
[2023-01-05 20:22:22] <%Mr_Panda> maybe BB2
[2023-01-05 20:22:23] <%aliveohiosky> the lag on the roll in elden ring made it feel much more sluggish than ds3
[2023-01-05 20:22:23] <%$Bloody_Raw> Light Souls
[2023-01-05 20:22:24] <%+ProxyOT> there are less I frames in Elden Ring because the roll animation is faster
[2023-01-05 20:22:27] <Vyrlokar> They're done with Dark Souls until they're short on cash

[2023-01-05 20:23:07] <baddragonprincess> it feels slow when you run away all the time

[2023-01-05 20:23:10] <%ShowtimeTylers> different, but not slow imo
[2023-01-05 20:23:16] <%+rudefrog> I hope AC is good

[2023-01-05 20:23:17] <%+FoolishOneGames> I think you do way more attacking in Senior to break posture
[2023-01-05 20:23:25] <%scssquatch> sekiro feels very fast to me
[2023-01-05 20:23:25] <%JOHUshy> Sekiro is a rhythm game
[2023-01-05 20:23:28] <KOOLSM0KE> @Azur85 how you play makes the game defensive. If you play it like a souls game, sure.

[2023-01-05 20:26:53] <%blueskytreb82> That's in every Souls game, but there are just fewer weapons in Bloodborne
[2023-01-05 20:26:57] <%Rocky210420> what's your favorite souls game overall
[2023-01-05 20:26:57] <%sergeant_sly> late afternoon BARB!!!!
[2023-01-05 20:27:00] <%meetreality> @barbarousking have you tried doing the werewolf skip to open up other weapons?
[2023-01-05 20:27:01] <%aliveohiosky> speed running to the DLC for the good weapons is the way NODDERS
[2023-01-05 20:27:01] <%+FoolishOneGames> I hate that one of the bosses is buried in the chalices
[2023-01-05 20:27:14] <$Drummerman921> If you don't find it in the next hour is it time to panic? KEKW
[2023-01-05 20:27:14] <%simms56> The nightmare area kind of really took away from how good I thought the game was
[2023-01-05 20:27:14] <%ShowtimeTylers> @canadianplatypus its actually really not that hard, to my understanding it just requires tweaking a few files. Its just rumored that they have lost the original data to go back and change it

[2023-01-05 20:27:21] <%meetreality> yeah that one

[2023-01-05 21:09:18] <%aliveohiosky> the first 3 seasons were fuccking great

[2023-01-05 21:56:13] <Rhinoceritis> They would say no, but really yes. The purpose of the republican party is to strangle the government so it can't tax rich people
[2023-01-05 21:56:13] <@%$deejay4am> If it goes on through today, doesn't a forced recess happen and Biden can do recess appointments? I think they don't want this
