[2022-12-07 04:22:37] <%SwitchOfChaos> The aim assist in apex is a slow drag that is most prevalent during long distance shooting. It can't keep up well in close range fights because its such a slow drag. So in order for aim assist to be a real assist while on controller the player needs to be at mid to long range

[2022-12-07 04:27:18] <%SwitchOfChaos> Close range apex its kind of a detriment to be honest especially with how important movement is in apex aim assist will automatically lock on to the closest target which is great for dealing as much damage as possible when there are a lot of targets all at once. It isn't as great for securing kills or keeping up with the movement of a single squad of players
