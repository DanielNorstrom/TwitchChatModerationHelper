[2023-01-05 08:56:44] <BeardedWingman> Do we know if launch speed has anything to do with length of time on the map screen?
[2023-01-05 08:56:54] <+FlapjacksHOTNREADY> you trying to launch yourself far or the car?
[2023-01-05 08:57:29] <BeardedWingman> He's going for CarOnTheMoon%
[2023-01-05 08:58:02] <BeardedWingman> You're definitely getting more consistent launches than the other night I think

[2023-01-05 09:49:20] <@StinkyTreen> Also RIP
[2023-01-05 09:49:21] <crattik> some of these Amok movies aren't even directly  about Amok. Check out this 2017 movie synopsis: "A man is murdered, but the person responsible avoids being discovered and arrested. A few years later a police inspector suspects he has found evidence in a newly-published book entitled "Amok"."

[2023-01-05 09:53:30] <Beastmister> Amok strikes me as very familiar to Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants", deliberately omitting many details for the purpose of vague interpretation.

[2023-01-05 10:35:15] <Locopengu1337> So you need to him 27 times. In the Chest - This means, ~5x Reload
[2023-01-05 10:35:15] <TheSandmanFables> 1 miss means an extra reload anyway, might as well go for body
[2023-01-05 10:35:24] <Locopengu1337> Headshot does how much?
[2023-01-05 10:36:14] <TheSandmanFables> there was a goggle doc i saw a couple days ago, can't find it now
[2023-01-05 10:36:24] <Locopengu1337> Okay, only Headshots = 4x Reload. only Chest = 5x. So i would prefer NOT to headshot all the time because you miss a shit ton of bullets trying to hit the head for just 1 reload?
[2023-01-05 10:36:32] <Lidawano> 35 for waist and 34 everywhere else I believe?
[2023-01-05 10:36:52] <Locopengu1337> Doesnt make any sense if you ask me
[2023-01-05 10:37:11] <Locopengu1337> Maybe a god like shroud could go for headshots only :D

[2023-01-05 10:45:16] <Locopengu1337> So my theory is correct. ONLY in the beginning. Shoot - wait around 1 second - keep shooting
[2023-01-05 10:45:31] <Locopengu1337> @TheSandmanFables Ah no i dont, we have to wait for max to try again
[2023-01-05 10:45:33] <NovaSpectre_> im still in awe that this was released 2 months ago and not in 2002
[2023-01-05 10:46:06] <TheSandmanFables> even if im wrong about the window, taking beat to fire the next shot leads to fewer misses so it might be worth

[2023-01-05 11:51:07] <+irrationalwife> what's the disconnect between the car launching vs the player? has anyone figured that out?
[2023-01-05 11:51:17] <+irrationalwife> or is that the key?
[2023-01-05 11:51:18] <gracefulartorias> probably not and if they do moist said he will extend the challenge for a day if there are hidden skips @oachelous
[2023-01-05 11:51:19] <FriesNl> This game actually would definitely be better if they had two categories, launch% being one and if the bounty was for non launch% only LUL

[2023-01-05 11:59:12] <deer92> it doenst even matter since the rule is if there is new strat in the winning run, the competition gets extended
[2023-01-05 11:59:28] <shadowk222> @eosphoros_sorohpsoe but if it's easy to execute someone could beat you with like a one day extension, if you had to grind for it in secret like the launches it is obvious you were lying

[2023-01-05 13:57:56] <Archaius> but i think its only worth doing if u do another launcher afterwards which is rng

[2023-01-05 15:23:41] <+mizori__> its kinda sad that at this moment the run only depends on the RNG of those 2 skips
[2023-01-05 15:23:54] <%LeonardoWyrnist> at least cone and cock are somehow consistent right? its just plank rng KEKWHD
[2023-01-05 15:24:09] <%+YamaJuugo> Cone and mansion skip saves how much?
[2023-01-05 15:24:12] <+xGroooVy> so are runners now just brute-forcing runs and hoping they get the flings
[2023-01-05 15:24:16] <RileyRunsIt> yeah 25: is very possible with good execution cone and log
[2023-01-05 15:24:34] <%Healer_BTW> @xGroooVy yup, basically
[2023-01-05 15:24:37] <Archaius> i mean us till have to be a top runner for the skips to matter, but yeah between the best runners rng is gonna make the diffrence most likely
[2023-01-05 15:24:47] VIEWERS: 875
[2023-01-05 15:24:51] <Frookie12> is crane, cone skip?

[2023-01-05 15:25:18] <RileyRunsIt> cone is pretty consistent which is nice
[2023-01-05 15:25:28] <espyism> Who has the best time right now?
[2023-01-05 15:25:39] <SerithTheSly> Or find a new skip, but I'm guessing any other skips likely will be just as fucked PrideLaugh

[2023-01-05 15:25:55] <Archaius> yeah but all the skips that come right after the cone are pure rng i think @RileyRunsIt
[2023-01-05 15:26:07] <%+YamaJuugo> If that‚Äôs the case your run would need to be a sub28 to hit sub26 with these skips I guess
[2023-01-05 15:26:47] VIEWERS: 875
[2023-01-05 15:26:56] <Archaius> u cant win by finding a new skip tho, if someone hides a skip until close to the end then the deadline is gonna get extended

[2023-01-05 15:27:12] <Archaius> yeah ofc
