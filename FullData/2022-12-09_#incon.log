She ended up getting adopted by someone that ended up going traveling and she's been with the group ever since.

[2022-12-09 17:20:43] <%Raxiuss> you ever tried to change a number in this game? one second you're adjusting ability values and the next Vulcan turret crashes the Portuguese client @Incon
[2022-12-09 17:21:13] <%oiskeyp0iskey> itll be 3501 putting you in bronze
[2022-12-09 17:21:14] <%+TruePlewd> with your spaghetti the code is, the elo cap number is probably tied to something strange and raising will don something weird like make Kuzen true Kaiju size
[2022-12-09 17:21:19] <%+verictalosson> raising ELO cap actually sells off their stock options so

[2022-12-09 17:21:34] <@%$air2jodran3> I was gonna say maybe getting to 10k MMR would break the game but they could just change the cap to 9,999 so idk

[2022-12-09 17:22:38] <%oiskeyp0iskey> lets be honest, smite is coded with random variable names, that they have to look up when they want to change something
