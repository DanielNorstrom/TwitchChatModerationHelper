[2023-01-10 03:05:56] <%Nutzzz96> @Cetkaman, initially it was supposed to be a dlc for HK with hornet as playable char, but then it became so yuge, they just decided that it should be a game by itself and then for delaying they just said they wanted to work on it more
[2023-01-10 03:06:08] <%Nutzzz96> wasnt satisfactory what they had uptill that point

[2023-01-10 06:46:47] <@%Skwishi> I think my jaw would hurt
[2023-01-10 06:46:52] <!%xrossdelta> the guy ask for the wife to get naked for thousand

[2023-01-10 06:48:21] <@%Skwishi> you'd need practise first
[2023-01-10 06:48:25] <%Nutzzz96> Thinkge
[2023-01-10 06:48:28] <@%julliant> I think it's less of size and more of how long they take
[2023-01-10 06:48:31] <%+hongyi90> I can't suck on lolipops and popsicles for more than 5 mins, i would end up biting through halfway because my jaw feels sore
[2023-01-10 06:48:31] <@%Cetkaman> he already said that he will try to figure something out FeelsStrongMan
[2023-01-10 06:48:33] <@%julliant> Thinkge

[2023-01-10 06:49:05] <!Kyyuna> NODDERS
[2023-01-10 06:49:20] <!%xrossdelta> whats more insulting? suck for 2hours and not CUM or suck for 2hours and not even hard
[2023-01-10 06:50:07] <%Ji04> 2nd one 100%
[2023-01-10 06:50:10] <x3Stealer> @xrossdelta not hard
[2023-01-10 06:50:24] <!%xrossdelta> Thinkge
[2023-01-10 06:50:32] <@%julliant> This is the offline chat topics i sub for
[2023-01-10 06:50:34] <%Ji04> but then again i must ask why are you sucking someone impotent?
[2023-01-10 06:50:53] <!%LinLin_nn> julliant feels like home okey
[2023-01-10 06:50:56] <@%julliant> Maybe not impotent but desensitised
[2023-01-10 06:50:59] <!%xrossdelta> yea but like what if he is impotent when u are sucking him not others Thinkge
[2023-01-10 06:51:05] <@%Skwishi> not hard would be an massive hit to the ego
[2023-01-10 06:51:11] <@%Cetkaman> how do you not get hard after 2 hours of stimulation hmmMeeting
[2023-01-10 06:51:15] <!%LinLin_nn> Tru
[2023-01-10 06:51:28] <!%LinLin_nn> Not CUM means they suck at sucking
[2023-01-10 06:51:31] <@%Cetkaman> it must be intentional at that point no?
[2023-01-10 06:51:34] <@%Skwishi> not true
[2023-01-10 06:51:39] <!%xrossdelta> i dont think i will get hard at someone i really dont like Hmm
[2023-01-10 06:51:40] <@%Skwishi> not hard means not good
[2023-01-10 06:51:48] <@%julliant> Maybe the guy is straight afterall  so you dont only need to suck but also dress up
[2023-01-10 06:51:51] <@%Skwishi> not cum could just be they are great at teasing
[2023-01-10 06:51:54] <@%julliant> HotFemboy
[2023-01-10 06:51:58] <@%Skwishi> especially if they are still hard

[2023-01-10 06:52:34] <%Ji04> is hatefuck a thing?
[2023-01-10 06:52:36] <@%Cetkaman> i member seeing a japanese game show where they tested if a gay porn star could make a straight one cum with sucking Hmm
[2023-01-10 06:52:40] <!Kyyuna> Hmm yes
[2023-01-10 06:52:57] <!%Yolovsky> game show Thinkge

[2023-01-10 06:53:06] <@%julliant> Im sure it is even though i cannot understand
[2023-01-10 06:53:09] <@%Cetkaman> but they covered the guy sucking so the one being sucked did not see him just knew that it was a guy
[2023-01-10 06:53:17] <!Kyyuna> ya there was a theory on that
[2023-01-10 06:53:24] <@%julliant> If it's a person i severely dislike i dont see how i can even get hard
[2023-01-10 06:53:34] <@%Cetkaman> and he got hard despite trying not to iirc
[2023-01-10 06:53:35] <!Kyyuna> just turn it around 4Head
[2023-01-10 06:53:59] <%Ji04> either way a good time 10/10 would be Gayge
[2023-01-10 06:54:00] <!%LinLin_nn> So stimulation > preference?
[2023-01-10 06:54:05] <@%julliant> I guess it's like masturbating cause it's technically a man's hand
[2023-01-10 06:54:42] <@%julliant> Plus the dude can just use imagination
[2023-01-10 06:54:51] <@%julliant> If he's a weeb just pretend it's a femboy

[2023-01-10 08:07:43] <@%hatduck_> TIL about this guy
[2023-01-10 08:07:44] <@%hatduck_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsewang_Norbu
[2023-01-10 08:08:19] <@%hatduck_> protested by self immolation in front of the Potala Palace in Tibet
[2023-01-10 08:08:34] <@%hatduck_> and china suppressed his death news Sadge
[2023-01-10 08:10:02] <@%julliant> Sadge
[2023-01-10 08:10:05] <@%Cetkaman> Sadge
[2023-01-10 08:10:08] <@%julliant> china gonna china
[2023-01-10 08:10:15] <@%julliant> but it seems more things are leaking out these days
[2023-01-10 08:10:24] <%Ji04> "Voice of America's Tibetan channel reported in May 2022 that Norbu's father, Choegyen, committed suicide after being threatened and harassed by the Chinese police"
[2023-01-10 08:10:32] <@%hatduck_> a lot of things have been leaking out for a long time
[2023-01-10 08:10:34] <@%hatduck_> but wcyd
[2023-01-10 08:10:35] <@%Cetkaman> did not even know about the self-immolation protest form Thinkge
[2023-01-10 08:10:40] <@%hatduck_> what
[2023-01-10 08:10:40] <%Ji04> so did he protessed or harassed until suicide?
[2023-01-10 08:10:45] <@%hatduck_> u didnt know about self immolation
[2023-01-10 08:10:50] <@%hatduck_> havent u seen this image
[2023-01-10 08:10:50] <@%Cetkaman> NOP
[2023-01-10 08:11:00] <@%Cetkaman> i mean i knew that some monk did it

[2023-01-10 08:11:15] <@%Cetkaman> but not that multiple people did since then
[2023-01-10 08:11:25] <@%hatduck_> what a legendary picture
[2023-01-10 08:12:02] <!%xrossdelta> Norbu died on 25 February 2022 by self-immolation, after having set fire to himself outside the Potala Palace in Lhasa. He was the 158th Tibetan to die in this manner since 2009.
[2023-01-10 08:12:04] <%Ji04> the saddest thing is its not enough to move enough people to act
[2023-01-10 08:12:07] <!%xrossdelta> i would say
[2023-01-10 08:12:09] <@%julliant> there were some recent riots about fireworks ban or something in china
[2023-01-10 08:12:10] <!%xrossdelta> 158 is alot
[2023-01-10 08:12:15] <!%xrossdelta> monkaGIGA
[2023-01-10 08:12:43] <@%Cetkaman> yeah i saw that, but i did not know it was like a form of buddhist protest
[2023-01-10 08:12:54] <@%Cetkaman> thought it was an isolated case Scaredge
[2023-01-10 08:13:07] <@%hatduck_> not just buddhist
[2023-01-10 08:13:50] <%Nutzzz96> shame on people that bring such suffering to others smhmyhead

[2023-01-10 08:14:34] <%+o1nk3rs_> @julliant it's fun and games until they roll out the tanks
[2023-01-10 08:15:39] <@%julliant> depends on the size of the movement i guess
[2023-01-10 08:16:00] <@%julliant> if it's more centralized it's easy but if many provinces simultaneously it will be hard
[2023-01-10 08:16:29] <%Nutzzz96> thats hard
[2023-01-10 08:16:32] <%Nutzzz96> cause people are selfish

You allow only what you want to allow, based off of your standards, not even the proprietor's. Tolerating bullies based on subscription status. Funny how the abusers are quickest to play victim over the internet. Open up your eyes. "banned for harassing viewers" by confronting two bullies personally and leaving it out of public affair.
