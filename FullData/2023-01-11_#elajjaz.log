[2023-01-11 10:35:02] <%Pandushe> waiting to see if disillusioned adventurers or w/e isnt garbage isekai before i commit
[2023-01-11 10:35:25] <%Quifenadine> i like it so far
[2023-01-11 10:35:28] <%AwakenedGarou> its not even isekai ? HUH
[2023-01-11 10:35:30] <%Pandushe> watching anos innit
[2023-01-11 10:35:40] <%Quifenadine> yeah also its not isekai
[2023-01-11 10:35:46] <%Quifenadine> its fantasy
[2023-01-11 10:35:47] <%Pandushe> bruh whatever

[2023-01-11 10:36:15] <%Quifenadine> handyman reincarnated one is pretty good
[2023-01-11 10:36:16] <%Pandushe> its not following the typical isekai formula of having someone getting isekaied but that shit is isekai
[2023-01-11 10:36:17] <%Quifenadine> humor isekai
[2023-01-11 10:36:23] <%Quifenadine> Bitch
[2023-01-11 10:36:26] <%Quifenadine> its not isekai

[2023-01-11 10:36:33] <%Quifenadine> if you go by that logic
[2023-01-11 10:36:47] <%Quifenadine> then isekai is actually just fantasy anime but changing worlds
[2023-01-11 10:36:56] <%Pandushe> pretty much innit
[2023-01-11 10:37:08] <%Quifenadine> they are pretty much the same genre
[2023-01-11 10:37:18] <%Quifenadine> except for the reincarnation schtick
[2023-01-11 10:37:36] <%Pandushe> its just lazy authors making up garbage world where they dont want to make up a power system

[2023-01-11 10:38:17] <%Quifenadine> i just like isekai mostly because 80% of them are power trip
[2023-01-11 10:38:20] <%Pandushe> isekai kinda lost its meaning when it become this saturated
[2023-01-11 10:38:34] <%Quifenadine> but speaking about isekai

[2023-01-11 10:55:06] <%SlavioAraragi> COME ON
[2023-01-11 10:55:16] <%Pandushe> OPM s2 was also good imo, people shit on it, rightfully i think it had major flaws, but overall i was satisfied, maybe it just takes very little to make me happy 4Shrug
[2023-01-11 10:55:18] <%SlavioAraragi> when it comes to actual battles? One of the betters on the market nowadays NODDERS
[2023-01-11 10:55:42] <%Quifenadine> opm s2 was good, people shot themselves in the food expecting s1 level of animation though
[2023-01-11 10:55:46] <%SlavioAraragi> that one fight in S3 was SO WELL animated like DAMN
[2023-01-11 10:55:46] <%Quifenadine> foot*
[2023-01-11 10:56:11] <%Pandushe> i think high profile case like OPM deserved better animation, downgrading is not acceptable
[2023-01-11 10:56:11] <%$Tyrael109> HUHH
[2023-01-11 10:56:29] <%Quifenadine> wasnt opm s1 like a giga special case
[2023-01-11 10:56:32] <%SlavioAraragi> plus Mob Psycho has the best track that makes kazoo sound dope LUL take that anime soundtracks ElaLoser
[2023-01-11 10:56:39] <%Quifenadine> where they pulled giga strings to get like gigachad animators
[2023-01-11 10:56:44] <%Pandushe> was it special? idk
[2023-01-11 10:56:51] <%Quifenadine> i think it was
[2023-01-11 10:56:55] <%$HappiSmyle> Dunno. For me it was the story that went dank FeelsDankMan
[2023-01-11 10:56:55] <%Pandushe> it was just different studio for s2
[2023-01-11 10:57:01] <%Quifenadine> well that too
[2023-01-11 10:57:04] <%$HappiSmyle> on the other hand - I don't remember it well
[2023-01-11 10:57:05] <%SlavioAraragi> I mean if they did that for season 1 and not 2, it's the studio's fault LUL
[2023-01-11 10:57:09] <%HEIL_MODS_> chat elp i cant Bruhge
[2023-01-11 10:57:21] <%Pandushe> fucking bullshit how JC didnt go with their A teams for OPM

[2023-01-11 10:57:28] <%Quifenadine> well ofc
[2023-01-11 10:57:32] <%Quifenadine> danmachi makes more money for them pandush
[2023-01-11 10:57:37] <%SlavioAraragi> the community was expacting certain level of quality which they couldn't deliver LUL it's their fault LUL
[2023-01-11 10:57:46] <%Pandushe> does it
[2023-01-11 10:57:51] <%Quifenadine> i think so
[2023-01-11 10:58:04] <%Pandushe> id say OPM is bigger than danmachi
[2023-01-11 10:58:17] <%SlavioAraragi> what's danmachi elaHmm
[2023-01-11 10:58:20] <%Quifenadine> 4Shrug
[2023-01-11 10:58:32] <%Quifenadine> im just going by what ive heard and i think its believable enough
[2023-01-11 10:58:35] <%Pandushe> but like railgun / index teams shoulda did OPM instead of whoever
[2023-01-11 10:58:36] <%AwakenedGarou> is it wrong to pick up girls in dungeon or whatever its calleed

[2023-01-11 11:20:20] <%$HappiSmyle> I don't remember world configs elaGa
[2023-01-11 11:20:21] <%AwakenedGarou> you mean hardcore or whatever?
[2023-01-11 11:20:33] <%AwakenedGarou> hardmode is post wall of flesh I guess
[2023-01-11 11:21:04] <%$HappiSmyle> Ah... you mean world is not past certain boss?
[2023-01-11 11:21:15] <%$HappiSmyle> I don't remember shit from Terraria elaGa
[2023-01-11 11:21:46] <%AwakenedGarou> Hardmode, as its name suggests, is essentially a more difficult version of the initial world. A world permanently converts to Hardmode after the Wall of Flesh boss is defeated for the first time. Hardmode grants players new challenges and gives them much more content to explore. Chateg
[2023-01-11 11:21:55] <%AwakenedGarou> Hardmode adds two new biomes to the world that will appear and function upon converting: The Hallow and the Underground Hallow. Along with The Corruption, The Crimson, and their Underground versions, they will spread continuously and at a steady pace in Hardmode. They may eventually overtake the entire world if not dealt with properly. Chateg

[2023-01-11 13:39:22] <%Grom_mash> meh
[2023-01-11 13:39:49] <%Grom_mash> in history of football, strikers are never the best player 90% of the time
[2023-01-11 13:39:53] <%tami_sv> well, it depends of MCity UCL performance
[2023-01-11 13:39:56] <%Grom_mash> its really rare
[2023-01-11 13:40:28] <%Grom_mash> usually attacking midfielders/wingers are best players in the world most of the time
[2023-01-11 13:40:34] <%Grom_mash> maradona, pele, messi all that
[2023-01-11 13:40:34] <%tami_sv> Strikers aren't key players, but great classic strikers like him always cool, it's rare nowadays
[2023-01-11 13:40:38] <%Grom_mash> none of them are strikers
[2023-01-11 13:41:00] <%tami_sv> Grom_mash I think most moon2GIGA players are defending mf/centerbacks
[2023-01-11 13:41:01] <%Grom_mash> because you have more control of the game from lil bit back
[2023-01-11 13:41:07] <%zoibergOne> strike deez nuts docUnpleased
