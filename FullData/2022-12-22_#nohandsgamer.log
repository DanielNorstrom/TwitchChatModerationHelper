[2022-12-22 00:26:56] <%haoxus_wayne> is this deck more fun, or the frost dk

[2022-12-22 00:28:45] <RonMexicoHS> that's ok, I'll be biased enough for both of us
[2022-12-22 00:28:52] <+StuffedVulture> have you considered not running Shockspitters in your Shockspitter Hunter deck?

[2022-12-22 00:29:36] <5ftHax> weapons are myths apparently
[2022-12-22 00:29:55] <%haoxus_wayne> in a game of hearthstone, you scam or be scammed
[2022-12-22 00:29:55] <RonMexicoHS> I think this list is questionable fwiw, I run 6 weapons in mine
[2022-12-22 00:30:26] <RonMexicoHS> lol excellent point
[2022-12-22 00:30:26] <%$doomlordduck> @RonMexicoHS my list is even better it runs 7 weapons
[2022-12-22 00:30:27] <Jimmy_Page_> 4 seems enough
[2022-12-22 00:30:35] <%+ucdchris1> i think this shockspitter card is to expensive may we cut it Kappa
[2022-12-22 00:30:36] <RonMexicoHS> I love having all weapons in hand and nothing else though
[2022-12-22 00:30:40] <5ftHax> but what if we run 5 weapons :)
[2022-12-22 00:30:50] <RonMexicoHS> @RonMexicoHS that's nutty! can we make it 8?

[2022-12-22 00:33:23] <+StuffedVulture> the solution to the weapon problem is clear: add Sunwell so we can randomly generate a Warrior spell to give us a weapon
[2022-12-22 00:33:24] <Jumbokcin> everyone asking to cut shockspitter doesnt understand why this deck is strong

[2022-12-22 02:59:27] <UncorruptGG> renathal is -5 health. but every deck plays astalor which is +5 health. 40 card decks are the same and 30 card decks are +5 health. average deck health is higher now than in nathria

Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-22 05:53:35] <+vrpatel82> 100% true statement: the game is better when Rogue is  good
[2022-12-22 05:53:51] <%+Xeath5> yeah because if rogue isnt "good" its busted

[2022-12-22 07:05:53] <+DebatableAwesome> I think blizzard has gotten a little too comfortable consistently nerfing decks that aren’t power outliers imo
[2022-12-22 07:05:54] <bizjeet5> check this game out when u have time if curious
[2022-12-22 07:06:06] VIEWERS: 1 076
[2022-12-22 07:06:11] <bizjeet5> the netherdrake is a test card rest of the list is standard svalna 30
[2022-12-22 07:06:22] <smilingsaint> people already hate frostwyrm.  snowfall was much better than that
[2022-12-22 07:06:24] <+Dallaen> Remember when control warrior got nerfed and it wasn't even that oppressive. Sadly if you reverted all those nerfs the deck would be underpowered in the game today.
[2022-12-22 07:06:27] <@%+InsomAtLaw> @NoHandsGamer blizzard should have hired me to run hsesports instead of abar, thoughts?
[2022-12-22 07:06:41] <chromat1> If it was a spell similar to the new DK card stronk but ok
[2022-12-22 07:06:44] <@%lass_leah> oof
[2022-12-22 07:06:44] <%+Xeath5> @bizjeet5 premature concede from the enemy
[2022-12-22 07:06:51] <bizjeet5> haha yea
[2022-12-22 07:06:59] <@%+InsomAtLaw> he can be a good dude and still not be good at his job
[2022-12-22 07:07:01] <+chuuwire> Sounds like something blizzard would do is nerf frostwyrm cuz it reminds them of snowfall KEKW
[2022-12-22 07:07:05] <bizjeet5> he was cooked
[2022-12-22 07:07:07] <+AdlerXI> guys is Anub Rekhan still worth crafting ?
[2022-12-22 07:07:28] <grimBleeper> Kappa the culture that steals breast milk?
[2022-12-22 07:07:33] <%breakfast_boi21> What's the culture of blizzard?
[2022-12-22 07:07:37] <+chuuwire> @AdlerXI pretty sure you still run it in any ramp deck
[2022-12-22 07:07:44] <%+Xeath5> embracing cheating @breakfast_boi21
[2022-12-22 07:07:44] <@%+InsomAtLaw> i agree that i might be a bit too combative for blizzard culture, even if that's what they need KEKLEO
[2022-12-22 07:07:48] <ShellBasher1> You mean OUR breastmilk?
[2022-12-22 07:08:06] <@%lass_leah> Id get fired from Blizzard for yelling any anyone who'd listen to make more Starcraft games

[2022-12-22 07:08:54] <bizjeet5> usually ppl wait it out tho
[2022-12-22 07:09:14] <%+Xeath5> if you fail you die
[2022-12-22 07:09:15] <chromat1> Is this deck so much better than regular beast hunter?
[2022-12-22 07:09:20] <%+Xeath5> so waiting is always right
[2022-12-22 07:09:27] <%+Xeath5> @bizjeet5
[2022-12-22 07:09:46] <%breakfast_boi21> I've seen many people lose to themselves with that deck
[2022-12-22 07:09:50] <+StuffedVulture> holy hell those animations
[2022-12-22 07:09:58] <bizjeet5> I could have killed off just discovers there not even playing the cards lol
[2022-12-22 07:09:58] <randomer22> Astalor should be a beast, thoughts?
[2022-12-22 07:10:03] <+rdulivemod> i dislike manathirst so much
[2022-12-22 07:10:06] <+chuuwire> @chromat1 I think it's the nerf to renathal. not much reason to play 30 beast hunter when you can just spitter them in 30
