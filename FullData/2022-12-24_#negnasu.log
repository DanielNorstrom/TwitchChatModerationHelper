[2022-12-24 04:03:15] <%$RTSAvalanche> When my mum was like 15 she went to the city to see a music band - the trains were cancelled.. so by luck she was able to call her neighbours who told her parents to pick her up - b'coz her parents didn't yet have a phone... my mum aint that old, it's just technology has only been he for a relatively short time
[2022-12-24 04:03:21] <%t0rashii> and you also think it’s neat how you see the changing of technology in media like movies? like how you see cellphones used decades ago and now smartphones being used? idk why I find it neat

[2022-12-24 04:06:38] <%+Dragoon790> Yeah. Not sure if it's still a thing, but I found them years ago when I was looking for a new phone. Sony Experia phones (at that time) were from Japan and wouldn't work with US mobile phone networks. Would have been a great alternative to Samsung.
