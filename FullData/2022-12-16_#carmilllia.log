[2022-12-16 05:22:07] <kraken_guy> Okay so it will take time, but sometime in the game you will have the option to go to harv‚Äôs island. There will be a point in time where there is a camp like area in the back once you donate enough bells, one of the shopkeepers that will attend this camp can help you customize things, like a beach chair.
[2022-12-16 05:22:55] <%Late_Night_Vision> this game can be VERY roundabout

[2022-12-16 05:23:50] <kraken_guy> Yes the downside is that it will take time, but the upside is that shopkeepers that visit your island can show up at camp so you don‚Äôt have to wait. Excluding the turnips
