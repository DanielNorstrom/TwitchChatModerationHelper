[2022-12-27 14:16:02] <%viktor_mehl> im happy with finally upgrading my GTX 1060 you are upgrading a PC that would work fine for the next 10 years lol
[2022-12-27 14:16:11] <W1ll1amK1rby> how far has tommy got in valhiem?
[2022-12-27 14:16:27] <%grokberg> I expect someone to build the tower of Babel this stream
[2022-12-27 14:16:38] <%viktor_mehl> @TommyKayLIVE what is your current graphics card?
[2022-12-27 14:16:39] <%prolhty> Chatting
[2022-12-27 14:16:45] <%+Marian_Bros> you will need to change motherboard if you change to new processor
[2022-12-27 14:17:09] <%grokberg> Different sockets for different processors
[2022-12-27 14:17:16] <%iteryn> power bills @TommyKayLIVE

[2022-12-27 14:17:22] <%dave_grb> yes
[2022-12-27 14:17:24] <%ahmedskulj10> Yep 3090 is fine af
[2022-12-27 14:17:25] <Moist613> @TommyKayLIVE If youre getting a new mother board aswell you could Transfer to AMD Which imo is better than Intel atm
[2022-12-27 14:17:25] <%+Marian_Bros> 3039 is good
[2022-12-27 14:17:26] <%viktor_mehl> 3090 is already overkill now KEKW
[2022-12-27 14:17:32] <%+ZeKaiserYa> @tommykaylive want a new processor? get the new intel pentium II processor
[2022-12-27 14:17:33] <!%+Bence9811> yeah it's "fine"

[2022-12-27 14:17:43] <%dave_grb> 3090 is enough for some more years
[2022-12-27 14:17:43] <%Feedbackgaming> 4000's have avi encoder support that twitch is gonna support 'some day'
[2022-12-27 14:18:04] <%gabor_774> Hi chat
[2022-12-27 14:18:04] <KingGeraint> Also, Tommy is a 1080p gamer, so 4000 series is totally overkill
[2022-12-27 14:18:12] <%viktor_mehl> @dave_grb many years lol
[2022-12-27 14:18:17] <%+Marian_Bros> DDR4 IS strill fine
[2022-12-27 14:18:24] <%iteryn> DDR5 is still early adopter phase
[2022-12-27 14:18:27] <%ahmedskulj10> ddr5 ram is not needed currently in my opinion
[2022-12-27 14:18:29] <ApplePieAlive> the only good spec the 4090 gives is tax write of +
[2022-12-27 14:18:35] <%viktor_mehl> yea 32gb DDR4 is fine
[2022-12-27 14:18:36] <%dave_grb> DDR5 is too Young IMO wait a Bit more
[2022-12-27 14:18:36] <%iteryn> 64GB RAM is nice KEKW
[2022-12-27 14:18:47] <%bl4ckh4wk1907> 128GB? KEKW

[2022-12-27 14:19:16] <%viktor_mehl> @TommyKayLIVE 32GB of DDR4 is more than enough

[2022-12-27 15:19:16] <laphahahaha> @TommyKayLIVE There is no definitive answer to this question as opinions vary. Some people argue that movies can be bad because of the impact they have on society and the messages they can send. For example, some movies may glorify violence, promote unhealthy relationships, or contain questionable values. Additionally, some movies may contain objectionable content that may not be suitable for all viewers.

[2022-12-27 15:36:07] <zoomerboomer124> @TommyKayLIVE Investing into the water industry can be a risky venture. Water is a finite resource, and in many areas, water is becoming increasingly scarce due to drought, overuse, and pollution. This can lead to supply shortages, which can reduce the value of investments.

Democracy encourages peaceful resolution of conflicts, as citizens can voice their opinions and work together to find solutions to problems.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in "advanced" countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.

[2022-12-27 16:18:02] <dasdadsdadsadsasd> @TommyKayLIVE Tommy I want to give you a few tips for Valheim, I have 3k hours in it. Build a base and upgrade it with better materials to increase your defenses. Complete quests and explore dungeons to find powerful items and rewards. Join a clan or start your own to help you survive and progress further in the game.

[2022-12-27 18:13:18] <%GeminiRedheart> search up "runners knee"
[2022-12-27 18:13:21] <%TimtheT4nk> jogging is terrible for the joints, go for a swim instead
[2022-12-27 18:13:22] <%GeminiRedheart> might be similar to what you got
[2022-12-27 18:13:22] <ApplePieAlive> @Overlord277 same
[2022-12-27 18:13:36] <%Dylanmeh> it's getting worse because it needs to rest

[2022-12-27 18:14:43] <@%Shekel____> lol he is so short his legs don't reach the floor he needs a box
[2022-12-27 18:14:50] <northican> when i had knee problem i had to take pills and put knee support like wrap cloth around knee to make both bones push bit more away from each other so they dont rub on each other that creates inflation and water collects between bone.
[2022-12-27 18:14:51] <%weirdfancypants> Tommy have you thought about a standing desk>
