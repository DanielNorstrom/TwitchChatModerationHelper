[2023-01-10 02:56:12] <Astral_Cannibal> The new event in Hunt lets you self revive as a solo, too.

[2023-01-10 05:25:09] <+LissXIV> New FFXIV patch in 6 hours. This is my waiting room
[2023-01-10 05:25:10] <%Faebianna> the only thing I'd change about the MtG video game is... when you scroll over an effect, it gives you a hud definition of the effect, like kick or first strike, etc and maybe an option for an example.

[2023-01-10 06:27:33] <%woodzy_0> commander is the "hang out with the bro's and play casual magic" game mode.
[2023-01-10 06:27:39] <%BertoChromatic> I WISH MTGA had Commander.
[2023-01-10 06:27:40] <+Conkwell> commander is my main mode. historic brawl is what they call it on arena
[2023-01-10 06:27:44] <+regent_raven> commander is fun when people dont know what they are doing, otherwise its just inf combo decks that take forever to play
[2023-01-10 06:27:46] <pecoto> Commander is literally a SUPER nerd format.  Like be prepared for INFINITE combos and shenanigans of cards no one EVER heard of before.  Ridiculous stuff, mostly.
[2023-01-10 06:27:57] <Jaeberwok> @Sequisha if you're interested, untap.gg has a twitch extension that allows chat to read your cards
[2023-01-10 06:27:59] <Fishnet83> @The_Murz Nope. only one
[2023-01-10 06:28:04] <BongFIeshlightCombo> do they have commander on this? i thought it was 60 decks only
[2023-01-10 06:28:13] <%+skuzzo> @The_Murz No, each one triggers independently.
[2023-01-10 06:28:16] <%The_Murz> that's a shame

[2023-01-10 06:28:26] <%Sad___People> Isn‚Äôt it called historic brawl in arena? @bertochromatic
[2023-01-10 06:28:34] <%woodzy_0> @regent_raven yeah, or they destroy you on turn 4. Thats why it is important to know what power level your deck is at and play with ppl with similar level.
[2023-01-10 06:28:41] <%+metagrassdx> Mtga has historic brawl, its 100 card ckmmander but they allow planeswalkers as commanders
[2023-01-10 06:28:43] <+Conkwell> @BongFIeshlightCombo yeah. brawl is commander but only standard sets. 60. historic brawl is commander with everything on arena. 100

[2023-01-10 06:29:01] <%Gavly> they have commander on arena?

[2023-01-10 06:29:05] <%Straata0123> isn't a -1 -1 death for a 1/1
[2023-01-10 06:29:08] <%BertoChromatic> @Sad___People Historic Brawl is 1v1 and only cards on Arena. Comander if 4players FFA with most cards in magic.
[2023-01-10 06:29:12] <just_some_pvp> you can use the instant after they delcare block
[2023-01-10 06:29:13] <pecoto> Plainswalkers should have NEVER been added to the game.

[2023-01-10 07:28:15] <+regent_raven> @CaffeineAndBullets exactly magic works in "blocks" of 3 sets. Once a set rotates out the cards from that set arent legal in most formats. Some formats extend back further but only 1 really lets you use any card minus a few banned ones
[2023-01-10 07:28:24] <+MasterDub1> "insta-win" would be situational most likely.

[2023-01-10 10:39:49] <MidnightMagicHut> @TeddyBundy_ What format have you been enjoying? Historic will show you what the meanest decks on Arena can do, pretty much the same with Explorer. Standard is an ok starting point as a new player, less cards, so less overwhelming. MY bet is most players would suggest a 40 card format, I just personally am not into draft. Draft is a good way to learn though.

[2023-01-10 11:27:34] <MidnightMagicHut> ..and tbf some archetypes are generally more or less powerful. That can change with the printing of one new card though.
