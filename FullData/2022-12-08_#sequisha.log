[2022-12-08 21:30:28] <Steroidbrucie> i think new world should try to get more company pvp stuff into the game. for now its just wars and influence which is not really motivating
[2022-12-08 21:30:33] <%+intriguedguest> i mean, aren't there 3 exits
[2022-12-08 21:30:52] <Triandkilmi> OPR is a joke... the rewards are laughable umbral wise and they take so long or are just a pure blowout not in your favor
[2022-12-08 21:31:01] <Steroidbrucie> i think taking over the fort e.g. could also be a company pvp thing
[2022-12-08 21:31:14] <Steroidbrucie> which guarantees the bfuf for a few days or something
[2022-12-08 21:31:23] <%$Rogue_XD> @TypeG i have my left eye on it. in one of the other discords, there is the NW announcement bot that updates from the officiial forum. When i see them update it.. i can post it in company chat and our discord if you'd like

[2022-12-08 21:31:49] <Babyeekz> yeah prob
[2022-12-08 21:32:00] <%+Sprynx007> what can fix spawn camping is if they place 2 repeater turrets at top of the spawn that auto attacks the enemy team and deals 10% flat damage per hit  KEKW

[2022-12-08 23:52:18] <%JohnDoeRadio> @Sequisha the fix for DF is to window capture in OBS as a source so ir recognizes the window.  just fyi.  no pressure.
[2022-12-08 23:52:25] <VicRamen> was it double bound?

[2022-12-08 23:53:34] <%iamCodec> This reminds me of Paragon. Anyone remember that? I thought this idea for a game in this genre is pretty neat
[2022-12-08 23:53:38] <vDriska> It took me like two games to learn that you can hold the RMB to aim that pull, lol
[2022-12-08 23:53:44] <%D0lphinLundgren> Now we're gaming

[2022-12-08 23:54:47] <%The_Despotian> what if a Transformer F'ed a W40k Space Marine... then fell into League of Legends, but 3D
[2022-12-08 23:55:05] <+BobbyJee> yeah its like : Fault , overprime and predecessor lol

[2022-12-08 23:58:22] <Oukeef> Predecessor > Overprime in my opinion
[2022-12-08 23:58:27] <%+Clron_Defiler> What happened to Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-08 23:58:27] <+wilkinator93> pred>op
[2022-12-08 23:58:27] <+MicktheFly> What do you prefer about Pred over Prime
[2022-12-08 23:58:28] <Oukeef> Much smoother gameplay
[2022-12-08 23:58:31] <%nineshadowsvici> paragon was my favorite game of all time can't wait to play this
[2022-12-08 23:58:32] <bekie1> Oh shit, I've been playing overprime so automatically typed it LUL
[2022-12-08 23:58:39] <BorderTownBricks> about to try overprime
[2022-12-08 23:58:42] <+Yumtastical> Predecessor, which unironically is the successor to Paragon.
[2022-12-08 23:58:44] <BorderTownBricks> let's see
[2022-12-08 23:58:44] <+wilkinator93> @MicktheFly op is a brawler, no moba
[2022-12-08 23:58:48] <@%Leminnz> Lmao
[2022-12-08 23:58:51] <Oukeef> Smoother game, not a money grab, Much closer to OG paragon
[2022-12-08 23:59:19] <@%WeThePeople> This does look pretty cool
[2022-12-08 23:59:20] <+MicktheFly> @wilkinator93 preciate it
[2022-12-08 23:59:21] <%+joshmutiny> wait there's other iterations of paragon?
[2022-12-08 23:59:32] <%ButteredGoods> @Ciron_Defiler issues with display settings/capture
[2022-12-08 23:59:32] <bekie1> I prefer overprime at the moment simply cause they have more characters
[2022-12-08 23:59:36] <@%WeThePeople> !s oukeef
[2022-12-08 23:59:37] <@%^Nightbot> Check out oukeef at twitch.tv/oukeef - oukeef was last playing Predecessor!
