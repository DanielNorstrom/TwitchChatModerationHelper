[2023-01-05 11:48:48] <@^Nightbot> wrong channel, this is Kyedae's Twitch. Please refrain from asking excessive questions about TenZ as it is disrespectful to the streamer, and if you want them answered they are most likely on his social medias. Repeated asking will result in bans.

[2023-01-05 11:51:53] <arthemlive> @pokeslash_ i had the same problem for 6 months and I was so confused since my pc and Internet provider were both good. 6 months of YT videos but no fix. Then I found out that wifi uses 2.4GHz band and a new 5GHz band. Bluetooth devices also use 2.4GHz frequency so Bluetooth devices can interfere with your Internet. By default your pc uses 2.4GHz frequency so I would suggest changing it to 5GHz. Fixed my issue

[2023-01-05 17:15:47] <+Nicos1603> @lileggaf agree asf
[2023-01-05 17:15:47] <demondevil_> Tarik's just "studying" the video
[2023-01-05 17:15:47] <hansoriiii> " After seeing Valorant's posts the past few days, players started speculating that the next map will be in South Korea. This theory began when they heard K-pop playing in the video featuring Fade, which was later confirmed to be a song by K-pop singer and streamer Jae Park (also known as eaJ). "

[2023-01-05 18:46:14] <@^Nightbot> Ping (Packet Internet Groper) is a method for determining communication latency between two networks. Simply put, ping is a method of determining latency or the amount of time it takes for data to travel between two devices or across a network. As communication latency decreases, communication effectiveness improves. A low ping time is critical in situations where the timely delivery of data is more important than the quantity and quality of the desired information.
