[2022-12-27 09:41:24] <shatteredblade89> @jellybeanbethany i love me some pasta... with alfredo or a CRAP ton of cheese. I tend to make some homemade mac n cheese with my own pasta
[2022-12-27 09:41:41] <jellybeanbethany> @shatteredblade89 when i say healthy i mean make good habits like researching good portion sizes make sure you do still get all nutrients needed

[2022-12-27 09:42:00] <%+cheeky_b52> @shatteredblade89 I know everyones different, and this isnt #ad but going with a meal prep service ( i use factor) has helped me tremendously. Just having healthy meals in a portioned manner helped me police my eating habits and that alone has made a huge difference in just the past 8 months. and i severely lack self control.
[2022-12-27 09:42:03] <shatteredblade89> Oh i know. right now i eat anything thats made sadly
[2022-12-27 09:42:06] <jellybeanbethany> @shatteredblade89 PASTA IS THE BEST
[2022-12-27 09:42:35] <shatteredblade89> @cheeky_b52 sadly most meal prep places are expensive af. too much that i cant afford
[2022-12-27 09:43:05] <jellybeanbethany> @cheeky_b52 i‚Äôve heard that! i like cooking my own and as shattered said i can‚Äôt afford that

[2022-12-27 09:43:45] <shatteredblade89> It doesnt help that i eat when im bored, sad, or angry either
[2022-12-27 09:43:49] <shatteredblade89> im a heavy emotional eater

[2022-12-27 09:44:25] <jellybeanbethany> @shatteredblade89 i like sweets but when i have sweet i want salty and it‚Äôs a chain that was my issue
[2022-12-27 09:44:31] <shatteredblade89> @Bulfwyne iv been having to do that a lot lately. Most of my meals are fillers like potatoes, or salads lately

[2022-12-27 09:46:01] <%+cheeky_b52> @shatteredblade89 I feel that. My mother is in a similar boat, and she's been prepping her own meals basing them off how factor sets up their meals and she's been going well. I am however a lazy ass so i just pay the money. It'll cost you time (self prep) or money. Hardest part is getting started and the ravenous hunger for the first couple weeks. if you power through that I think you'll do well. I've never been so consistently violently hangry until i adjusted to the new diet
[2022-12-27 09:46:04] <jellybeanbethany> @immahoodieninja GOOD MORNING

[2022-12-27 09:50:02] <shatteredblade89> there was a point i ate only potatoes for a month. idk why but i REALLY loved potatoes.
[2022-12-27 09:50:20] <shatteredblade89> i bought a 50lb bag for the month and i lost about 21 pounds

[2022-12-27 09:51:36] <%+cheeky_b52> @shatteredblade89 best of luck with it. first couple weeks are the hardest. I shoot for a daily sub 2k calorie total, i try to go for a slight calorie deficit but keep it balanced so you still get enough nutrients. You WILL feel so much better and have more energy, I promise. I felt like i was on monster 24/7 with the natural energy going from eating like a college student to a healthy diet.

[2022-12-27 11:04:26] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.

[2022-12-27 16:35:24] <@%nmussa> !np
[2022-12-27 16:35:24] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.
[2022-12-27 16:35:30] <@%nmussa> There are plenty of other servers of FiveM though
[2022-12-27 16:35:33] <@%^StreamElements> Support Curvyelephant as a full-time streamer by subscribing! Benefits include stuff like sweet emotes and a sexy badge. https://www.twitch.tv/curvyelephant/subscribe | Sub for free with Amazon Prime: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
