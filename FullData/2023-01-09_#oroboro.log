[2023-01-09 03:45:30] <!%$Mohl97> @Rinsl0r did you have to use the shoulder buttons to strafe and look up and down? That's a sure sign of being one of the older games
[2023-01-09 03:45:48] <$xSHARKPUNCHx> if only it ran well on ps3
[2023-01-09 03:45:53] <+Myhtraas> running at 120km/h lol
[2023-01-09 03:45:58] <StormGuard0> bruh how are you running this?
[2023-01-09 03:46:01] <SoundReaver> Emulation has improved immensely over the years.
[2023-01-09 03:46:18] <!%$Mohl97> not even half a year ago the emulator had trouble getting AC textures to work
[2023-01-09 03:46:56] <!%$Mohl97> you can download the updates for this one easily at least
[2023-01-09 03:46:58] <phantom_cavalry1> heyyyyyyyy!

[2023-01-09 03:48:32] <!%$Mohl97> @Rinsl0r I don't think 3 or silent line give you any missions like that too early, and they don't have much of a cutscene, so I'm guessing you played 2.
[2023-01-09 03:48:48] <SoundReaver> Whole salvo fired
[2023-01-09 03:48:57] <!%$Mohl97> missiles are great in this one tho oro

[2023-01-09 03:49:46] <%fearofcorners_music> That techno was from the game?

[2023-01-09 03:50:20] <!%Ebonslayer> Do you know if this is one of the PS3 games with game speed tied to framerate?
[2023-01-09 03:50:21] <!%$Mohl97> yeah, thought I'd at least see if I could narrow down a specific game

[2023-01-09 04:17:28] <!%$Mohl97> honestly after having played through 2 to silent line, I kinda like how those play more than 4 and for answer. There's a sort of deliberateness to it and your movement's more refined feeling, between having to learn bunny hops and such

[2023-01-09 04:18:48] <+KaiserSchnitzel> @siegfriedwolfz no it will be nothing like Elden Ring, at all

[2023-01-09 05:04:40] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> lockspeed doesn't matter as much as range for some weapons

[2023-01-09 06:09:08] <%spahooly> @spahooly lol probably
[2023-01-09 06:09:16] <SwiftBee_> @spahooly wat the beebea1Stare
[2023-01-09 06:09:20] <%AbyssCuda> @AbyssCuda 6 and 7 are both good
[2023-01-09 06:09:22] <Koji104> I think Armored Core 1 and 3 have a 1st person mode
[2023-01-09 06:09:28] <Nenod> destroy america D:
[2023-01-09 06:09:52] <Koji104> lits kinda an easter egg and you gotta do some button combo each time
[2023-01-09 06:09:59] <confusedbiscuit5> Oh this is much easier

[2023-01-09 06:10:07] <%Orhka> I just got Patch to give up
[2023-01-09 06:10:11] <confusedbiscuit5> So go fire fire
[2023-01-09 06:10:17] <MoistHeinous> it would be cool if armored core had player invasions atpNinja
[2023-01-09 06:10:19] <%Orhka> should I go for it ?
[2023-01-09 06:10:33] <Ferakin> Yeeees
[2023-01-09 06:10:42] <%Orhka> Armored Core Co-op would be so fun
[2023-01-09 06:10:44] <%vindicator> @MoistHeinous It technically does it's called hard mode
[2023-01-09 06:10:46] <%Orhka> with some really hard missions
[2023-01-09 06:10:47] <!%$Mohl97> @Koji104 either 3 or silent line lets you just turn on first person in the cockpit settings
[2023-01-09 06:10:53] <confusedbiscuit5> @MoistHeinous as a veteran AC player, I would enjoy that. I'd be pissed about getting my butt bladed by another AC when I've got no ammo.
[2023-01-09 06:11:10] <confusedbiscuit5> @Mohl97 IIRC 3, Silent Line, and AC 1 can do that
[2023-01-09 06:11:20] <BlueRye42> @Orhka fromsoft already said ac6 wont have coop single player id guess they are focusing on making single player content polished like sekiro
[2023-01-09 06:11:25] <!%$Mohl97> for answer has co-op btw
[2023-01-09 06:11:33] <confusedbiscuit5> @BlueRye42 ah well. A man can dream
[2023-01-09 06:11:35] <MoistHeinous> @vindicator no one ever invaded me then no1CRY
[2023-01-09 06:11:37] <%Orhka> I know, but a guy can dream @BlueRye42
[2023-01-09 06:11:51] <Lazyman310> AC5VD had co-op missions
[2023-01-09 06:11:52] <!%$Mohl97> not sure what missions you can do it for, but it's definitely there
[2023-01-09 06:11:58] <confusedbiscuit5> I mean if they made free dlc to employ co op. That'd be great.

[2023-01-09 06:12:07] <MoistHeinous> 5 had that weird scanning thing
[2023-01-09 06:12:14] <%Orhka> I never had friends to paly 5 with Sadge
[2023-01-09 06:12:16] <%AbyssCuda> collision dmg i mean
[2023-01-09 06:12:18] <confusedbiscuit5> It's okay Oro. 5 was directed by the Chrome Hounds  and stuff LUL
[2023-01-09 06:12:21] <Koji104> I got into V when it was super dead
[2023-01-09 06:12:29] <BlueRye42> yeah not a fan of constantly switching to scan mode in v
[2023-01-09 06:12:31] <+sskfbsts> You think Miyzaki is going to bless us with another GOTY with AC6?
[2023-01-09 06:12:35] <confusedbiscuit5> @Koji104 same. but i ended up being a mercenary for a lot of people.
[2023-01-09 06:12:37] <woodlandfell> WHOA ARMORED CORE
[2023-01-09 06:12:40] <!%$StryfeDragon> My main issue with 5 was having to switch to Scan mode in order to have EN regen worth a damn
[2023-01-09 06:12:48] <Ferakin> I feel like people conflate 5 and Verdict Day a lot, too
[2023-01-09 06:12:51] <+CokexLogic> plus, the jumping, didn't use up your generator
[2023-01-09 06:12:52] <Lazyman310> yeah you nearly can't emulate it :(
[2023-01-09 06:12:53] <!%$Mohl97> @confusedbiscuit5 I guarantee you they'll leave the entire souls multiplayer code in the game. They did that for sekiro and you can play that online because of it
[2023-01-09 06:12:54] <Ferakin> VD is definitely better than 5
[2023-01-09 06:12:59] <%Orhka> ACV emulation on Xenia is nonexistent
[2023-01-09 06:13:10] <%Orhka> dunno about the one you use
[2023-01-09 06:13:15] <!%$Mohl97> I got verdict day to run, but the framerate was bad
[2023-01-09 06:13:22] <confusedbiscuit5> @Mohl97 here's hoping. Because if there was a chance for co op. I would like to dive int oti LUL
[2023-01-09 06:13:26] <%vindicator> AFAIK the Armored Core Discord guys actually play ACV on consoles still
[2023-01-09 06:13:27] <!%Ebonslayer> I wonder how it must feel seeing a mech the size of a house flying around.
[2023-01-09 06:13:35] <%mistahmistah> at least you can buy verdict day digitally pvpSK
[2023-01-09 06:13:37] <MoistHeinous> armored core 3 had the first person view which was cool
[2023-01-09 06:13:40] <+Peculer> armored core 3 is goated
[2023-01-09 06:13:42] <+Lawliiit> I really loved AC2 and 3
[2023-01-09 06:13:42] <confusedbiscuit5> Oro, out of all the Gen 3 armored cores. Do not touch Last Raven until you have gotten used to Gen 3.
[2023-01-09 06:13:50] <!%$Mohl97> the old games all emulate pretty well
[2023-01-09 06:13:53] <%vindicator> Play Last Raven first LUL
[2023-01-09 06:13:58] <NeroIscariot12> Oh dude the PS2 games are goated. I have put so much time in Nexus and Last Raven
[2023-01-09 06:14:03] <confusedbiscuit5> Last Raven is the game where Miyazaki who did the planning threw every single curve ball he could find

[2023-01-09 06:14:09] <Lazyman310> I love that AC4FA has 3 good playthroughs goin for it at least with the endings
[2023-01-09 06:14:10] <!%$Mohl97> also as biscuit said don't play last raven first that game will fuck you
[2023-01-09 06:14:19] <%vindicator> You have not known pain until you play Last Raven
[2023-01-09 06:14:30] <MoistHeinous> I liked last raven. I guess I'm in the minority
[2023-01-09 06:14:37] <MoistHeinous> atpNinja
[2023-01-09 06:14:43] <%vindicator> It's not that it's a bad game

[2023-01-09 06:15:01] <%vindicator> By like an order of magnitude
[2023-01-09 06:15:10] <MoistHeinous> I loved last raven's arena

[2023-01-09 06:17:03] <%vindicator> Yeah you have to beat the game like three times to get every mission
[2023-01-09 06:17:08] <+Bl4z31n> I dont remember the name but those scatter missiles ones are good
[2023-01-09 06:17:08] <%Orhka> 2nd play through unlocks Orca and the rest

[2023-01-09 06:18:38] <Lazyman310> it will work you just need a set of missiles to launch with it
[2023-01-09 06:18:46] <confusedbiscuit5> AS missiles just yeet everything out
[2023-01-09 06:18:50] <Lazyman310> like a shoulder mounted missile set

[2023-01-09 06:18:57] <confusedbiscuit5> That shits expensive
[2023-01-09 06:18:59] <%vindicator> @Oroboro Any missiles aside from relation missiles will work independently

[2023-01-09 06:23:52] <zekoyoga> yoo white glint
[2023-01-09 06:23:55] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> ryu is in the other mission cause localization is good 4Head

[2023-01-09 06:24:11] <!%Ebonslayer> Isn't this the player character from AC4?
[2023-01-09 06:24:19] <%vindicator> @Ebonslayer Yes
[2023-01-09 06:24:21] <Ferakin> Kasumi Sumika is your operator in this game, that one girl you beat up in 4's arena
[2023-01-09 06:24:29] <!%Ebonslayer> Huh.
[2023-01-09 06:24:34] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> @Ebonslayer yes, Fiona is the girl in that pilot's ear
[2023-01-09 06:24:35] <zekoyoga> White glint pilot is a girl??
[2023-01-09 06:24:38] <!%$Mohl97> @Orhka I'm trying to imagine mechs doing toggle escapes now
[2023-01-09 06:24:45] <Ferakin> Also Otz talking shit about chain boosting in this fight is so salty and dumb
[2023-01-09 06:24:47] <%vindicator> Also it's in official lore that White Glint isn't dead
[2023-01-09 06:24:52] <Koji104> @zekoyoga no
[2023-01-09 06:24:57] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> @zekoyoga no, the girl is his operator, same as the girl who tells you when your health is low
[2023-01-09 06:24:57] <%vindicator> @zekoyoga No, they screwed up the localization
[2023-01-09 06:25:00] <%Orhka> @Mohl97 dead angling too
[2023-01-09 06:25:03] <oValtorious> ???
[2023-01-09 06:25:06] <MoistHeinous> @vindicator o so hard mode is not cannon?
[2023-01-09 06:25:06] <!%Ebonslayer> Too much DbD.
[2023-01-09 06:25:07] <zekoyoga> ah i see thanks
[2023-01-09 06:25:28] <!%$Mohl97> oh would you look at the time, it's job o'clock
[2023-01-09 06:25:31] <%vindicator> @MoistHeinous It's outside of the game where it's explained
[2023-01-09 06:25:39] <oValtorious> Super feminine voice how is glint not female
[2023-01-09 06:25:44] <MoistHeinous> @vindicator nodders
[2023-01-09 06:25:48] <!%$Mohl97> @oValtorious that's his handler
[2023-01-09 06:25:52] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> @oValtorious the girl is his operator, same as the girl who tells you when your health is low
[2023-01-09 06:25:59] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> white glint's pilot doesn't talk
[2023-01-09 06:26:04] <Ferakin> @oValtorious My guy, that's the mission control girl from 4, not the pilot of the robot
[2023-01-09 06:26:06] VIEWERS: 507
[2023-01-09 06:26:13] <%vindicator> Also White Glint doesn't take damage until after Otsdarva goes down
[2023-01-09 06:26:14] <%Orhka> @oValtorious the pilot is mute, the person speaking is their "person in the chair"
[2023-01-09 06:26:17] <oValtorious> O
[2023-01-09 06:26:24] <oValtorious> Ty
[2023-01-09 06:26:26] <zekoyoga> oh so they're implying White Glint pilot is you from 4?
[2023-01-09 06:26:31] <Koji104> yes
[2023-01-09 06:26:34] <Ferakin> Oh yeah, he super is
[2023-01-09 06:26:35] <glorious_geo> time to rebuild
[2023-01-09 06:26:36] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> @zekoyoga yes
[2023-01-09 06:26:37] <confusedbiscuit5> @zekoyoga yes. Fiona took him away.
[2023-01-09 06:26:40] <Senzoku17> WutFace
[2023-01-09 06:26:40] <!%$Mohl97> @zekoyoga they outright state it somewhere
[2023-01-09 06:26:44] <Ferakin> Thats why his big dick energy is exploding out of him
[2023-01-09 06:26:46] <zekoyoga> i see, interesting
[2023-01-09 06:26:59] <Lazyman310> so yeah a reminder, relation missiles need hand or back missiles to launch with I believe
[2023-01-09 06:27:09] <NeroIscariot12> The MC of the previous game coming to bitchslap you will never not be hype
[2023-01-09 06:27:10] <!%$Mohl97> wouldn't be the first time they do that too, 2 has you fight Master of Arena's protag too
[2023-01-09 06:27:16] <%vindicator> Yeah, he took on Joshua O'Brien's AC name because they were allies/rivals back in 4
[2023-01-09 06:27:16] <MoistHeinous> howitzers atpNinja
[2023-01-09 06:27:21] <%Orhka> in their bio
[2023-01-09 06:27:30] <%vindicator> Basically the most dangerous pilot on the planet, that's why they won't send anybody alone to fight him
[2023-01-09 06:27:30] <!%$StryfeDragon> Shoot harder
[2023-01-09 06:27:32] <!%$Mohl97> more missiles
[2023-01-09 06:27:36] <+Bl4z31n> be better

[2023-01-09 06:27:44] <Ferakin> Just blade him, ez
[2023-01-09 06:27:47] <confusedbiscuit5> WG is not an easy fight.
[2023-01-09 06:27:49] <azuraru> just don't die LUL
[2023-01-09 06:27:49] <glorious_geo> dual machine guns
[2023-01-09 06:27:49] <ShatteredIce> hit them and don't get hit
[2023-01-09 06:27:51] <%Orhka> this level has hard Red vs Gold vibes in Pokemon Gold
[2023-01-09 06:27:54] <%Nirouku01> get gud
[2023-01-09 06:27:54] <confusedbiscuit5> So its normal to just redo fights
[2023-01-09 06:27:57] <Koji104> he takes on the name white glint in memory of Joshura the original white glint who you fight as 4's final boss
[2023-01-09 06:27:59] <!%$Mohl97> like seriously just slather his ass with missiles
[2023-01-09 06:28:04] <kygen> machine gun rifle combo for constant pressure?
[2023-01-09 06:28:05] <%thotacon_tv> DUAL GATS
[2023-01-09 06:28:05] <Lazyman310> in my last playthrough I literally missile spammed, hand missiles, back missiles, and relation missiles, with an fcs that was good for my missiles lmao

[2023-01-09 06:28:27] <%Nirouku01> if I remember I went with a overheat build which slowed him down
[2023-01-09 06:28:33] <MoistHeinous> the karasawa no1OOP
[2023-01-09 06:28:35] <Straata0123> all of them
[2023-01-09 06:28:37] <!%$Mohl97> if you have large missiles those are good
[2023-01-09 06:28:40] <%AbyssCuda> missiles on your missiles
[2023-01-09 06:28:41] <+CokexLogic> the hands missiles, were howitzers?
[2023-01-09 06:28:42] <+Bl4z31n> dual Canopus Kappa
[2023-01-09 06:28:49] <Lazyman310> there's a back missile that is really long and chain launches that I liked
[2023-01-09 06:29:05] <Lazyman310> an osage missile I think
[2023-01-09 06:29:05] <!%$Mohl97> the kojima missile was stupid strong but that needed you to s-rank some mission I believe
[2023-01-09 06:29:06] <Koji104> get a vermillion and a VTF
[2023-01-09 06:29:06] <%vindicator> VTF is usually the best for this
[2023-01-09 06:29:08] <LanceMcDonald> hahaha oh god we doing debugGIGAZAKI 's first video game? is this PS3 or 360?
[2023-01-09 06:29:13] <+LeCaptainFlynn> VTF are great
[2023-01-09 06:29:14] <+Bl4z31n> scatters are good or VTF?
[2023-01-09 06:29:19] <+Bl4z31n> Its been a while
[2023-01-09 06:29:23] <%Orhka> they should bring back finding weapons and parts in missions
[2023-01-09 06:29:29] <!%$Mohl97> I like scatter missiles,tbh
[2023-01-09 06:29:35] <LanceMcDonald> did you see how bad this runs on real PS3? I tweeted a clip its like 3fps in explosions
[2023-01-09 06:29:40] <Koji104> VTF exploded when there closes
[2023-01-09 06:29:40] <BlueRye42> debugPregazaki
[2023-01-09 06:29:48] <%Nirouku01> gamefaqs says twin machine guns work the best
[2023-01-09 06:29:55] <Ferakin> Somehow the 360 ran the 4/FA games better than PS3
[2023-01-09 06:30:02] <LanceMcDonald> hahahah i had never played this until the day before the AC6 announcement, it was ROUGH
[2023-01-09 06:30:11] VIEWERS: 522
[2023-01-09 06:30:14] <Lazyman310> if you can get up close without getting Assault Armor'd machine guns do melt
[2023-01-09 06:30:32] <%thotacon_tv> I had a dual gatling gun build that made this game easy as shit
[2023-01-09 06:30:33] <%huntera18> Goodnight y’all gotta be up at 4 fml
[2023-01-09 06:30:36] <LanceMcDonald> yeah i knew AC6 was gonna be announced the next day lol so i decided to try it out for the first time
[2023-01-09 06:30:41] <%mistahmistah> @Ferakin 360 seemed to run multiplats better a lot of the time
[2023-01-09 06:30:45] <%Orhka> wait
[2023-01-09 06:30:47] <%Orhka> YOU KNEW???
[2023-01-09 06:30:48] <LanceMcDonald> apparently it runs ok on 360 yeah
[2023-01-09 06:30:51] <%vindicator> 360 was God's console
[2023-01-09 06:31:00] <%Orhka> I played it on 360, never had any problems
[2023-01-09 06:31:05] <MoistHeinous> yeah 360 worked pretty good
[2023-01-09 06:31:06] <Ferakin> Basically the PS3 was the most laughably designed console ever
[2023-01-09 06:31:08] <+Bl4z31n> it ran fine on 360 but not PS3 idk why
[2023-01-09 06:31:08] <!%$Mohl97> I did dual machineguns at first but settled on what's basically just an old armored core loadout LUL
[2023-01-09 06:31:13] <!%Ebonslayer> If he told you he would've had to kill you.
[2023-01-09 06:31:15] <Ferakin> Its why MGS4 will never be ported forward ever
[2023-01-09 06:31:30] <Lazyman310> yeah you just have to remember to TURN THEM ON before you launch the back missile
[2023-01-09 06:31:32] <%vindicator> @Ferakin They really overhyped its processing power and then no developer knew how to use it properly
[2023-01-09 06:31:35] <%mistahmistah> @Ferakin don't kill my small bit of hope pvpSK
[2023-01-09 06:31:35] <woodlandfell> did you check fextralife
[2023-01-09 06:31:39] <Lazyman310> my controls had it as pressing circle/b
[2023-01-09 06:31:48] <NeroIscariot12> @Bl4z31n PS3 was notoriously hard to develop for. much a less a then pooor as fuck company like FromSoft
[2023-01-09 06:31:56] <%vindicator> Fuck Fextralife all my homies hate Fextralife
[2023-01-09 06:32:00] <Lazyman310> you got it 😎
[2023-01-09 06:32:05] <LanceMcDonald> tbh tho i was barely able to play this game. i couldn't really get far at all. The PS2 games i checked out more recently were way more approachablew

[2023-01-09 06:32:37] <Lazyman310> ac4/fa are known for being fast af, so that can make these games much harder
[2023-01-09 06:32:53] <%vindicator> I saw a Dark Souls player get filtered by the lowest order matches it was hard to watch
[2023-01-09 06:32:55] <%Orhka> yeah this mission is a vibe check for sure
[2023-01-09 06:33:09] <%Orhka> wasnt the previous mission the "easy" escort mission?
[2023-01-09 06:33:14] <%AbyssCuda> that damage tho
[2023-01-09 06:33:17] <!%$Mohl97> @vindicator I saw a bloodborne speedrunner get filtered by village khezu in rise once, that was hilarious
[2023-01-09 06:33:21] <Ferakin> I find it endlessly ironic that Dark Souls got famous for being "hard" but this game is the actual true test of skill and the internet never cared
[2023-01-09 06:33:22] <glorious_geo> dayum
[2023-01-09 06:33:23] <SpiritsRiseR2> Oro playing the GOAT?
[2023-01-09 06:33:23] <zekoyoga> interesting how the og fanbase kinda split up between before and after AC4, just my casual observation btw
[2023-01-09 06:33:25] <Koji104> Otz just getting stuck in a wall don't worry Kappa

[2023-01-09 06:34:01] <zekoyoga> ring out is so 2006
[2023-01-09 06:34:11] <Lazyman310> @zekoyoga no you are correct, many loved the fast paced combat of 4 while others preferred the slower gameplay of before
[2023-01-09 06:34:11] VIEWERS: 511
[2023-01-09 06:34:22] <%+direwolfnotinbed> this mission is to preserve the cradles but fuck you if you go out of bounds
[2023-01-09 06:34:23] <LanceMcDonald> in the design docs for Bloodborne they say Patches "originated in Demon's Souls". Japan Studio just pretending AC doesnt exist lol
[2023-01-09 06:34:34] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> @Ferakin marketing goes a long way, when your game is called "prepare to die" people get all high and mighty when they beat it
[2023-01-09 06:34:40] <SoundReaver> Rank one atpNinja
[2023-01-09 06:34:49] <Ferakin> Even the earlier AC games were pretty fast for mecha games, it's just that 4/FA were such a massive leap forward in speed
[2023-01-09 06:34:59] <MoistHeinous> getting some good shots in
[2023-01-09 06:34:59] <zekoyoga> @Lazyman310 i see, i wonder if Fromsoft will use AC4 speed or somewhere in the middle
[2023-01-09 06:35:02] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> if this game was called "get mouthfucked with rifle bullets and missiles" people would've known probably LUL
[2023-01-09 06:35:05] <zekoyoga> for AC6
[2023-01-09 06:35:07] <LanceMcDonald> by the way, the matchmaking for this game online still works
[2023-01-09 06:35:07] <glorious_geo> niceee
[2023-01-09 06:35:09] <%vindicator> 4/FA went full Gundam
[2023-01-09 06:35:12] <!%$Mohl97> @Lazyman310 I personally like both. They could do some monster hunter kinda stuff where they alternate between games of one style and the other
[2023-01-09 06:35:23] <Lazyman310> I think it will be slightly slower than 4/FA but close, same director I think
[2023-01-09 06:35:25] <%AbyssCuda> dude just tanking those hits
[2023-01-09 06:35:34] <MoistHeinous> the overboost one white glint so good
[2023-01-09 06:35:43] <!%$Mohl97> @LanceMcDonald yeah, I'm pretty sure it just runs off the most basic of PSN shit so it even works with emulated PSN. Castlevania Harmony of Despair is the same
[2023-01-09 06:35:53] <Lazyman310> @mohl97 I also love both, can't beat the mech customization either way ❤️
[2023-01-09 06:35:59] <%thotacon_tv> @MoistHeinous its orgasmic to activate
[2023-01-09 06:36:08] <LanceMcDonald> @Mohl97 yeah PSN supplied basic "matchmaking service" with no actual servers so as long as the PSN itself stays up, so does this I guess.
[2023-01-09 06:36:11] VIEWERS: 538
[2023-01-09 06:36:16] <zekoyoga> yeah Monster Hunter style where every style of combat you prefered is valid is good, tho MH itself is getting faster nowaday lol

[2023-01-09 06:40:34] <%Orhka> all those Kojima particles
[2023-01-09 06:40:42] <zekoyoga> just like real life
[2023-01-09 06:40:55] <+leon_kennedy> I used that one in AC4 but idk when you get it here
[2023-01-09 06:41:17] <!%Ebonslayer> Isn't there a part that grants infinite energy?
[2023-01-09 06:41:28] <Ferakin> Yeah it's called Regulation 1.5

[2023-01-09 06:42:44] <%Orhka> unironically, playing Ace Combat made me better at this game
[2023-01-09 06:42:45] <Ferakin> In 4 Rayleonard parts are the shit, 10 years later they're shit tier
[2023-01-09 06:43:05] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> don't forget to use your tuning and dump it into energy regen/capacity
[2023-01-09 06:43:05] <%vindicator> Virtue is still one of the best main boosters in FA
[2023-01-09 06:43:19] <Koji104> But the Lancel tho :(

[2023-01-09 06:44:42] <Ferakin> Honestly, Rayleonard looking like the most Formula 1 race car ever and having the worst energy problems is on point

[2023-01-09 07:22:57] <!%$Mohl97> honestly my only problem with SL is that there's just so many freaking hidden parts. like here's the standard "defend the AC part transport" mission except aside from the part to steal there's also one for getting a bunch of kills, another for doing it with minimal transport damage and a third one just laying around, and goddamn every mission has this
[2023-01-09 07:23:01] <%Orhka> it didnt show any damage
[2023-01-09 07:23:05] <Tylerjsmith97> congratulations.ya played yourself
[2023-01-09 07:23:34] <!%$Mohl97> like, I'm pretty sure there's only two missions in silent line that don't have hidden parts in them, and one of those is the final mission
[2023-01-09 07:23:46] <Koji104> I didn't even know about that

[2023-01-09 07:26:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @Mohl97 MOONLIGHT is more like MLGS than Moonveil.

[2023-01-09 07:30:52] <%Orhka> I always end up with like 4 missions missing

[2023-01-09 07:31:22] <Koji104> I just wish you wren't locked into the league ending for the 1st playthrough
[2023-01-09 07:31:26] <MoistHeinous> like rail guns?

[2023-01-09 07:31:49] <Tortuosa> go dual dragon slayers for the rest of the order matches

[2023-01-09 07:35:06] <+Saruman______> You know always wondered why the league set up orca in the first place only to try and stop them, or was the resistance more lead by the leagues ravens then the league itself?

[2023-01-09 07:36:06] <Ferakin> It's kinda neat that the League path ends with you defying the League, and vice versa with ORCA
[2023-01-09 07:36:17] <%Orhka> @Saruman______ they world is dying and they need access to Space, but the satellites in orbit limit them being able to do that
[2023-01-09 07:36:18] <%vindicator> If you want good light legs go with SOLUH, LATONA, or LAHIRE
[2023-01-09 07:36:21] <+Saruman______> Yea but it wasn't just Wynne, it was her, Roy, Roadie, it was most of the ravens
[2023-01-09 07:36:22] <Koji104> I've always thought it was orca hiring lynx/ravens who don't like the league just to wipe them out

[2023-01-09 07:54:23] <%Orhka> and dodge his grenades
[2023-01-09 07:54:25] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> it helps to know how to dodge missiles correctly too
[2023-01-09 07:54:26] VIEWERS: 539
[2023-01-09 07:54:27] <Koji104> you can sell them back for full price
[2023-01-09 07:54:29] <Tylerjsmith97> ok that sound when you're close to death makes me think a car door is open outside @oroboro
[2023-01-09 07:54:33] <Soonset> Oh man, used to have those missile dodge patterns memorized from pvp

[2023-01-09 07:56:40] <%Orhka> now gotta do the rest of the game on hard
[2023-01-09 07:56:41] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> at last
[2023-01-09 07:56:42] <froobz> this mission  PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 07:56:44] <Ferakin> "Your client is GA America, which means this mission is based and red pilled."
[2023-01-09 07:57:03] <Koji104> he called her ass goofy bruh
[2023-01-09 07:57:07] <%+direwolfnotinbed> "equip a radar you dumb noob"
[2023-01-09 07:57:08] <%Orhka> never forget GA Europe
[2023-01-09 07:57:08] <+Bl4z31n> merrygate is based
[2023-01-09 07:57:14] <Soonset> I miss this game so much. I'm excited to see them resurrect the series
[2023-01-09 07:57:14] <confusedbiscuit5> Smiley's greaattt
[2023-01-09 07:57:24] <froobz> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 07:57:30] <%+direwolfnotinbed> celebrity ash's dialogue for this is great
[2023-01-09 07:57:37] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> money means nothing get help
[2023-01-09 07:57:48] <+Mister_Nef_Nef> the npcs have funny dialogue too
[2023-01-09 07:57:48] <%Orhka> welcome to the mission where Red Rum carries and Starka tries to 1 shot you
[2023-01-09 07:57:53] <!%Ebonslayer> Muh frames.
[2023-01-09 07:58:02] <+Bl4z31n> nope :)
[2023-01-09 07:58:02] <confusedbiscuit5> no Red Rum is a shotgun
[2023-01-09 07:58:06] <+Bl4z31n> shotgun
[2023-01-09 07:58:07] <%+direwolfnotinbed> starka has a piledriver
[2023-01-09 07:58:08] <%Orhka> Starka is literally a cheeser
[2023-01-09 07:58:08] <obese_pterodactyl> blade is essential
[2023-01-09 07:58:13] <confusedbiscuit5> Red Rum uses the slug gun that rrips your Primal armor to shreds
[2023-01-09 07:58:15] <Koji104> He pile drives you in the dick
[2023-01-09 07:58:20] <confusedbiscuit5> so you become a glroified paper weight
[2023-01-09 07:58:26] VIEWERS: 583
[2023-01-09 07:58:34] <froobz> not to mention red rum always circles behind you
[2023-01-09 07:59:00] <glorious_geo> dead
[2023-01-09 07:59:08] <%Orhka> GA dog, Im gunna make you bleed
[2023-01-09 07:59:21] <kygen> I think one has an anti pa shotgun
[2023-01-09 07:59:37] <Koji104> might be because of the fog?
[2023-01-09 07:59:46] <confusedbiscuit5> @kygen starka with the slug gun
[2023-01-09 07:59:50] <confusedbiscuit5> that slug gun hurts
[2023-01-09 08:00:01] <confusedbiscuit5> if you take one hit it can strip your PA offf
[2023-01-09 08:00:08] <%+direwolfnotinbed> it's all he has basically, except for a rifle PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 08:00:10] <%vindicator> KAMAL is genuinely one of the best back weapons in the game
[2023-01-09 08:00:17] <!%$Mohl97> I didn't have this framerate issue when I played with the clown-vomit textures, maybe the lag's from loading three AC paintjobs?
[2023-01-09 08:00:26] VIEWERS: 574
[2023-01-09 08:00:39] <froobz> i never had this issue either
[2023-01-09 08:00:49] <%Orhka> if thats the issue maybe fun mission is a no go
[2023-01-09 08:01:01] <%+direwolfnotinbed> the emulator probably doesn't load the level in completely so it skips for the first 10 secs
[2023-01-09 08:01:04] <MatraTheEternal> It looked like it was just the intro speech lagging it.
[2023-01-09 08:01:26] <MatraTheEternal> Yeah, it's the speech.
[2023-01-09 08:01:38] <MatraTheEternal> The second they started talking again, it lagged.
[2023-01-09 08:01:38] <azuraru> red rum hitting that lag switch
[2023-01-09 08:01:42] <Koji104> yoo the dialouge box is lagging the game
[2023-01-09 08:01:47] <phuhqueKarai> Got some solid damage in that time.
[2023-01-09 08:02:08] <glorious_geo> blammed
