[2023-01-02 11:11:01] <%felirx> the talent doesn't work while flying so you need to wait on the ground
[2023-01-02 11:11:02] <Sadbe> yeah the 10% after gathering isnt enough i find myself waiting for vigor
[2023-01-02 11:11:04] <%+Braggardt> I just want more dragonflying mounts. Give me my Galakras proto-drake back Madge
[2023-01-02 11:11:07] <+coffeethefreshmaker> the talent needs to give a flat amount of vigor, not a % increase
[2023-01-02 11:11:08] <Kyprax> If the biggest complaint about dragonriding is that you can’t do it whilst you aren’t at your computer then they did a good job
[2023-01-02 11:11:11] <+leiyee> its annoying for gathering compared to flying, but compared to any other expac recently its still a lot better, since you can actually fly. AND you dont dismount...
[2023-01-02 11:11:15] <Lewsea> It's really only an issue if you're trying to gather in Azure Span. Gather in OP and there are no issues at all

[2023-01-02 11:11:25] <kazurath> The talent only restores vigor if you're on the ground. If it restored it while moving, or all at once, that would be much better.

[2023-01-02 11:29:24] <+Semikatyri> @laidback_landro so we don't run the same 8 dungeons the whole expansion
[2023-01-02 11:29:35] <%Geri_0123> @laidback_landro I guess more variety throughout the expansion, not the same ones for 2 years
[2023-01-02 11:29:47] <+Semikatyri> @laidback_landro it's actually a good way to bring variety into the dungeon pool
[2023-01-02 11:30:00] <+matsuri2057> @laidback_landro It means season 2 will be 8 completely different dungeons, which also means completely different loot. I think its a great idea personally

[2023-01-02 11:41:05] <morgott21> Is Preach tanking in battle stance?
[2023-01-02 11:41:07] <morgott21> is it better?
[2023-01-02 11:41:09] <%Zoervleisj> el depleto nodders
[2023-01-02 11:41:43] <+Sprinklerz> @morgott21 it makes you do more dmg and you dont realy need the extra dmg reduction from tank stance
[2023-01-02 11:41:53] <Thomas_Bont> @morgott21 alot of people opt out of defensive stance if its overkill, or if they have the tier set, because damage dealth grants ignore pain
[2023-01-02 11:42:00] <%Succath> Tanking in battle stance is more DPS less defence. if you can handle it its fine.
[2023-01-02 11:42:01] <shytam> I hope it's about lunch
[2023-01-02 11:42:06] <%$FoxonSilverfur> Defensive stance is actually kind of useless. Warriors are that strong

[2023-01-02 12:21:39] <+thomassax> pulling big in this dung is only bad if your kicks are bad. Lots of spells to stop
[2023-01-02 12:21:41] <%+bowza_> I find most pulls arent so much that the tank is in giga danger its how long can the group stay alive lmao
[2023-01-02 12:21:46] <+MrTRage> Your limit or the healers? xd

[2023-01-02 12:40:49] <Gaphill> @Saitouakira and the biggest problem with pugs is everyone slamming their aoe stun on the same pack at the same time
[2023-01-02 12:40:50] <ramneson> yeah SBG is free and Ruby is hell
[2023-01-02 12:40:59] <Jarlan23> this boss here is annoying because she does so many mechanics that its hard to actually do dmg to her
[2023-01-02 12:41:08] <%Dragonnan> I learned what kills me in dungeons and it always feels bad. It's my skill level not getting better in the last 6 years whatsoever, lolz

[2023-01-02 12:42:40] <Cimexis> I have a very consistent track record when it comes to not killing the trash at the other side, in that they consistently get pulled during the bossfight :P
[2023-01-02 12:42:46] <%+Kyletyldesley> atleast the floor isnt the same colour as the swirlies on this boss
[2023-01-02 12:42:47] <nykolasrage> Thundering is a dumb affix. I said it.

[2023-01-02 12:56:27] <%JakeStoney> @Mordwyl and you match the opposite color of yours to clear it
[2023-01-02 12:56:40] <%JakeStoney> otherwise you get a fat stun / dmg
[2023-01-02 12:56:43] <helafix696> why stay in this room?
[2023-01-02 12:56:48] <%Assirra> it's just a charge
[2023-01-02 12:57:11] <%Mordwyl> @JakeStoney Is it hard to do without the addon? I'm not fond of using these kinds
[2023-01-02 12:57:17] <mk__9> so many anti sanguine mobs in this season. mobs straight up refuse to move alkXD
[2023-01-02 12:57:21] <lochnezz1> yeah @Preachlfw I thought it was a tauntable spell. but no. its whoever is targeted gets hit.
[2023-01-02 12:57:30] <%JakeStoney> honestly the addon just makes it slightly easier and everyone else uses it so its expected @Mordwyl
[2023-01-02 12:57:38] VIEWERS: 3 547
[2023-01-02 12:57:38] <%JakeStoney> but no it's easy to do without the addon tbh
[2023-01-02 12:57:50] <CrerisRs> @JakeStoney you get a spell model above your head, a ball or a tornado, but its much easier to see a chatbox with blue square/red X compared to a tornado above someones head
[2023-01-02 12:57:53] <%JakeStoney> the debuff also give you dmg up so i have one that has a timer so i can minmax it
[2023-01-02 12:57:57] <+ConcernedGaming> Sanguine week I think its better to stay in the room. But non Sanguine if you move them to the Hallway you can avoid the traps, and the frogs cant jump as far away
[2023-01-02 12:58:06] <littlebluechair> These mobs you can tank in a corner to let ranged (if you have ranged) LoS the charge
[2023-01-02 12:58:08] <CrerisRs> so yes its doable without the chat thingie, but kinda harder to find ppl to clear on
[2023-01-02 12:58:10] <ramneson> NODDERS you need more %
[2023-01-02 12:58:19] <Grasshoppa117> u are the weakest link
[2023-01-02 12:58:20] <%+DieselDonkey> 2% off
[2023-01-02 12:58:33] <%felirx> one guard on the lizard boss?
[2023-01-02 12:58:37] <%felirx> and the patrol

[2023-01-02 12:58:40] <%+Wakuiy> Did you take any lashers in first room?
[2023-01-02 12:58:42] <%Mordwyl> @JakeStoney Mike never did E4S did he? It has a similar unique mechanic throughout the fight
[2023-01-02 12:58:44] <Jarlan23> by the second boss
[2023-01-02 12:58:49] <+lissa2_> the visuals are kinda annoyingly similar imo, but its not impossible. they get crazy similar close to the end tho

[2023-01-02 12:59:41] <%Mordwyl> Wouldn't it be easier to bait the puddles in one spot?
[2023-01-02 12:59:56] <+Delifes> then the exploding damage rips you
[2023-01-02 12:59:59] <plebmas> You cant bait in one spot
[2023-01-02 12:59:59] <+lissa2_> it going off hurts a good bit, stacking will kill you

[2023-01-02 13:00:19] <CrerisRs> @Mordwyl circle around you indicates it will do aoe damage around you, so if 2 ppl stand on top of each other you will cleave each other doing more dmg
[2023-01-02 13:00:19] <+nalkinpro> Is this one of those Korean streams?
[2023-01-02 13:00:20] <%Assirra> you can't jump off?

[2023-01-02 13:00:37] <+AtomJar> you did the skip at the start which basically means you have to pull everything to make count in this dungeon. can't miss that pat

[2023-01-02 13:04:02] <theri92> 1st comes fast
[2023-01-02 13:04:06] <+HekticFox> its a spell queue thing, especially if the beam is vanished
[2023-01-02 13:04:08] <%JakeStoney> the last affix i thought was interesting was the nyalotha one awakened i think

[2023-01-02 13:07:02] <+lissa2_> it still limits the range where they can spawn i think, relatively
[2023-01-02 13:07:05] <CrerisRs> no it worked fine
[2023-01-02 13:07:14] <%Mordwyl> @happysmile42 Depends what you like
[2023-01-02 13:07:15] <CrerisRs> the room would be a giant clusterfuck if the boss was in the middle
[2023-01-02 13:07:17] <+lissa2_> the change in slow duration was a good change for sure
[2023-01-02 13:07:17] <%felirx> oh no, they brough balls to tank
[2023-01-02 13:07:20] <lochnezz1> You did get them all close to the boss, instead of out on the edge of the other side of the room @Preachlfw
[2023-01-02 13:07:21] <+xPauL___> aaaaaand enter the balls

[2023-01-02 13:07:39] <%Assirra> @Jarlan23 they could adjust the spikes or something. The slow is just fucking annoying. Especially as a healer and people are in Narnia
[2023-01-02 13:07:50] <NotLevos> all these elemental dragons and stuff really feel like cata 2.0

[2023-01-02 13:08:43] <%+Wakuiy> There it is
[2023-01-02 13:08:43] <%CipansR> KEKL
[2023-01-02 13:08:44] <+Teddsan> this boss is so frustrating
[2023-01-02 13:08:44] <haahdek> Yeah that is why I hate this boss
[2023-01-02 13:08:47] <+lissa2_> yep
[2023-01-02 13:08:48] <%jadefoxyz> yeah it followes
[2023-01-02 13:08:49] <mk__9> @lissa2_ i feel like only healer (maybe tank?) can generate threat in them
[2023-01-02 13:08:49] <@%Bohya_> yeah they follow
[2023-01-02 13:08:51] <nosek121> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-02 13:08:52] <mk__9> but not sure
[2023-01-02 13:08:52] <%+KyaranAmanore> beware of the balls
[2023-01-02 13:08:52] <+Hyphixsys> KEKW
[2023-01-02 13:08:53] <Yaani> dont move to get debuff off you
[2023-01-02 13:08:54] <Fistulingus> Fuck those orbs.
[2023-01-02 13:08:55] <+BigstrongboiTV> was waiting for that. this boss sucks
[2023-01-02 13:08:55] <%JakeStoney> its a sneaky boss
[2023-01-02 13:08:56] <Jarlan23> if you were a dwarf you couldve stoneformed the slow off
[2023-01-02 13:08:57] <Sadbe> balls lock on to someone if they close when they spwan
[2023-01-02 13:08:57] <%felirx> just play prot paladin and freedom KEKW
[2023-01-02 13:08:59] <+lissa2_> they chase someone
[2023-01-02 13:09:00] <+silentkillervgc> yeah they follow the balls
[2023-01-02 13:09:01] <@%Bohya_> they do follow if you get close
[2023-01-02 13:09:01] <Exsyf> They actually stop following you when you stop moving
[2023-01-02 13:09:02] <%$sim967> that happens, it's worse when they train your healer
[2023-01-02 13:09:03] <%Neilotha> they react to healing agro
[2023-01-02 13:09:04] <@%Bohya_> afaik
[2023-01-02 13:09:05] <%JakeStoney> it follows you then stops sometimes
[2023-01-02 13:09:06] <+lissa2_> its healer/tank generally
[2023-01-02 13:09:07] <%+Wakuiy> It's some form of threat table yeah
[2023-01-02 13:09:08] <morgott21> the slow mechanic sucks
[2023-01-02 13:09:10] <Benjvdm> homing testicles
[2023-01-02 13:09:14] <+lissa2_> i dunno how it works precisely, some kinda healing threat table
[2023-01-02 13:09:14] <+purewinds> i like to move him along the wall away from the orbies
[2023-01-02 13:09:16] <+lissa2_> i think
[2023-01-02 13:09:16] <TaikunGaming> it follows when min x range
[2023-01-02 13:09:17] <Yaani> try not to move
[2023-01-02 13:09:20] <+Hyphixsys> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-02 13:09:21] <+Teddsan> u have to move to other corner after 3rd breath @Preachlfw
[2023-01-02 13:09:21] <Cimexis> They switch between following and just hovering from what I've seen
[2023-01-02 13:09:21] <Ithrowmagic_> if they remove the slow on this boss it would be fine
[2023-01-02 13:09:22] <+silentkillervgc> balls usually follow the tank/healer
[2023-01-02 13:09:23] <%CipansR> COPIUM
[2023-01-02 13:09:25] <+xPauL___> i guess youll wipe some more times on that
[2023-01-02 13:09:30] <+Sir_Raknas> they following healing
[2023-01-02 13:09:33] <lochnezz1> @Preachlfw it makes the knockback knock ur dps a lower distance so they dont have to rush over and make the orbs move
[2023-01-02 13:09:36] <lochnezz1> if u stick to the wall
[2023-01-02 13:09:38] <Ocdman182> its follows heals and tanks more you can move during storming buff easier tw

[2023-01-02 13:09:53] <melethron123> mystic raider failed to time the key? blizz nerf pls
[2023-01-02 13:09:55] <Yaani> just dont move to get the debuff off you
[2023-01-02 13:09:56] <Pen_on_Fire> Nobody nows what exaclty the reason is afaik
[2023-01-02 13:09:58] <belledelphinebathwater> @VipMalis lies
[2023-01-02 13:10:00] <Pen_on_Fire> knows
[2023-01-02 13:10:01] <+Banjo586> @Preachlfw i see tanks just move along the wall with the boss
[2023-01-02 13:10:02] <Yaani> and they dont follow than
[2023-01-02 13:10:02] <viczz88> director of Final Fantasy 9 is teasing us on SE website. WHAT IS HE PLANNING??!!!
[2023-01-02 13:10:03] <%felirx> it's nothing but crackpot theories
[2023-01-02 13:10:06] <%+vinnybearUS> no potion or food buff for a 16 ?
[2023-01-02 13:10:08] <lochnezz1> Moving makes them move, who they follow isnt related to moving
[2023-01-02 13:10:11] <Mr_scorpie> I did it last night. i got none of them. i was confused

[2023-01-02 13:10:21] <%Raidensoul> It Follows was a great education movie about STIs
[2023-01-02 13:10:23] <+lissa2_> yeah the exact mechanic isnt really known it just seems to consistently follow tank/healer
[2023-01-02 13:10:24] <+CrimsonChaord> I would just move like 20 yards here and there between debuff expirations and leap if ur real scared
[2023-01-02 13:10:28] <+nalkinpro> They follow the best hairline, I’m always safe
[2023-01-02 13:10:30] <aboveanbeyond7> It’s based off the stacks of the slow debuff. Higher stacks = more likely they focus you.
[2023-01-02 13:10:34] <iscamog> @viczz88 wdym?
[2023-01-02 13:10:37] <%muzuq> mornin' mike

[2023-01-02 13:11:03] <%Assirra> Naowh once could make them stack perfectly, he got a clip on his twitter
[2023-01-02 13:11:11] <haahdek> @aboveanbeyond7 definitely not true, had orbs follow me around for a whole Chi-ji (when I have no stacks at all)
[2023-01-02 13:11:14] <+silentkillervgc> druid and paladin are like only healer that kinda ignore the stacks of movement
[2023-01-02 13:11:18] <+Teddsan> this bosses movement debuff is the most god awful idea to ever be brought to wow
[2023-01-02 13:11:35] <belledelphinebathwater> @silentkillervgc ehh shaman?

[2023-01-02 13:44:46] <Ridsyx> you are supposed to trigger one more spirit before or after 2nd boss
[2023-01-02 13:44:46] <kuromebro> you need to either kill an elemental before the first boss, kill the patrolling exhumer after the 2nd boss or play the double spider standalone pack before 3rd boss
[2023-01-02 13:44:55] <Baddrood> I start pulling if the tank doesn't pull enough
[2023-01-02 13:44:58] <Armdel> unless its a premade, tank pulls
[2023-01-02 13:45:02] <%Assirra> Tank might be new and not confident though

[2023-01-02 14:10:44] <+Duryen> the big add needs to die fast, otherwise the overlap of the bleed and the toxins from the small adds will def kill you.
[2023-01-02 14:10:46] <+Spuddington_Bear> the circle takes like 5 seconds to actually dispell, so move the adds after it dies
[2023-01-02 14:10:46] <%doimos89> strategy is wait for like 2 nerfs to the boss and then it's gonna be doable :D

Branch spawns before small ones do, so I (as a healer) usually prefer it when group manages to burst down the Branch before the small adds spawn. Can get a bit sketch if it dies during swirlies though.

[2023-01-02 14:27:12] <%JakeStoney> jade / shadowmoon / court are easiest
[2023-01-02 14:27:16] <+Riot_Blacktimus> only hard part of CoS is last boss
[2023-01-02 14:27:20] <%JakeStoney> shadowmoon is exceptionally easy
[2023-01-02 14:27:28] <%+Bashiel> @Kell94 in combat timer that spawns the puddles, if you stand in puddle you're stunned, everyone in group get a charge, it gives a damage buff until timer runs out on the buff, if you dont clear your charge by running to opposite one before the end you're stunned
[2023-01-02 14:27:28] <+Freestyle20> 40 deaths??? lol

[2023-01-02 15:01:53] <Crimpson> The one thing I noticed they did with several bosses this expansion is made several boss arenas twice the size.  Good for having more room, but sucks for healers since people like to stay at max range and out of their heals
