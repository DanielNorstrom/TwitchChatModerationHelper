[2022-12-21 15:55:02] <%+Nuck39> Streamers should talk to their girlfriend beforte they start streaming. Talking to her while streaming, unless you put other content on and take the camera off you, is extremely bad manners and disgusting. "Streaming is a real job!" It is. But most streamers dont treat it like a real job. Between failing to make schedules, acting in a way that would be considered unprofessional, constantly calling off, etc etc. Content creation can be a real job. But most dont treat it as one.

[2022-12-21 16:52:57] <+Flappy_Gums> Catacombs have glovewort, caves have smithing stones as a general rule. Sum caves are visible on the map others are hidden and you will have to explore to find them.

[2022-12-21 19:02:44] <%MitosisDNB> if you're not on heals, you hold down on the d-pad and it takes you straight to heals

[2022-12-21 19:02:51] <%Codexnecro> if you press & hold for a second or two it goes directly

[2022-12-21 19:15:04] <%MitosisDNB> satisfaction of beating a tough boss is so good

[2022-12-21 19:15:11] <+RJACE_> you can see hours played in the save menu
[2022-12-21 19:15:11] <+RyuSpirit_> if you want to play with friends, do the seamless coop mod
[2022-12-21 19:15:11] <Dr4gonb0rn_> my first was 224 hours

[2022-12-21 19:15:25] <%+Jessy103> people aren't keen on souls games cos they think they're too hard but they're as easy or as hard as you want them to be
[2022-12-21 19:15:28] <%+AJ_Tupman> I can’t, my disability won’t let me do multiple key presses at once, and I can’t use a controller.
[2022-12-21 19:15:29] <meechall> believe it or not, i was just playing anthem lmao
[2022-12-21 19:15:32] <%rincon805> is it controller highly recommended?

[2022-12-21 19:15:55] <+Loki57_> @rincon805 recommend controller but ive heard this is the best souls game for m+kb so far
[2022-12-21 19:15:59] <%ZCrimes> its not hard at all. this game is easier as other souls
[2022-12-21 19:15:59] <Kerozinn_> consecrated snowfields almost made me drop the game lol
[2022-12-21 19:15:59] <%Royce55> rincon805 most would say so, I like kbm tho
[2022-12-21 19:15:59] <!%+xT1TANx> you pick things up so fast
