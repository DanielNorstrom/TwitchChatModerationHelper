[2022-12-21 16:46:17] <%Sh1mped> @Faide you could mantle the 3rd level to get to the top faster
[2022-12-21 16:46:24] <blue7355608> @dkm_entityx basically a script or file that acts as a macro, a button that does a mechanic for you like superglide without any skill

[2022-12-21 16:47:23] <spiritualwolf81> Do you use the zipline as a boost and superglide after the mantle? it's interesting to see but I'm clueless asf lol
[2022-12-21 16:47:27] <+stusssss_> Top of the climb is the key
[2022-12-21 16:47:28] <%lumiii8> do you prefer mantle or elite jumps?
[2022-12-21 16:47:28] <purple_boyr> @unkownr12  u welcome

[2022-12-21 16:47:43] <blue7355608> @spiritualwolf81 its not a superglide
[2022-12-21 16:47:45] <%DrPitus> @spiritualwolf81 its basically a superjump on the zip
[2022-12-21 16:47:47] <yung_sleazyy> @moe_x19 to avoid dead slide give yur sprint a reset before uu slide again

[2022-12-21 17:01:31] <%number1deadslider> @Faide you're wrong. if you climb too high you will hit the head and lose the vertical momentum of your super jump. most of your attemps are failing because of this already.

[2022-12-21 17:05:36] <%number1deadslider> @Faide Most of your attemps are failing because you climb too high. Mantle Jumping doesn't require climbing that high. Quite opposite actually, if you climb too high you will hit your head on the ceiling and lose your vertical momentum.

[2022-12-21 18:30:55] <@%RipCr0w_97> If they're gonna buff wraith just make her Q a near instant Q, so like reduce the delay before she enters phase. Cause you want that speed boost
[2022-12-21 18:30:59] <!%+rSoSwayy> still balanced

[2022-12-21 19:19:19] <%+Alucard_BT> @kula_lala On lower fps for sure, you can make it even easier by doing a command in config file to lower it by a second to make the superglides more consistent. Too lazy for it tho lol

[2022-12-21 19:22:18] <%+Alucard_BT> @kula_lala It is, go watch thevilinside he elaborates on it. But you just have to get the timing down. So obviously it's consistent once you know the flow of the animation :p
