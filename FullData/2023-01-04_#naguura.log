[2023-01-04 13:09:30] <+ch3ddarost> sim told me to have two pure haste green gems
[2023-01-04 13:09:31] <MrRox1337> doesn't lariat still sim the best regardless?
[2023-01-04 13:09:32] <%+Hyppotilus> go for crit, crits are always fun LUL
[2023-01-04 13:09:38] <snaggpitt> @Naguura thanks for the detailed answer. Would it be possible to do if it was not lariat?
[2023-01-04 13:09:41] <Shiftere> could you manual sim stat weights, then add that stat baseline to stats, then re sim statweight to see if it changes
[2023-01-04 13:10:11] <%+Kyuyan> Isn't stat weight sim broken?
[2023-01-04 13:10:14] <+seamuscg> I had no idea gems "procced" i thought the stats were just there lol

[2023-01-04 13:11:09] <MagnusQ8> i guess if you're a "proc" based spec you go for the proc on lariat but if you're a "CD" based spec you go for the more stable gem bonus

[2023-01-04 13:11:40] <+xfreakYx93> so what about some player have the same 3 gems. is the buff just reseting or you get it 3 times?
[2023-01-04 13:11:54] <+omqju> @seamuscg the gems themselves don't procc, its the necklace that proccs a buff with a stat depending on the gem you have equipped
[2023-01-04 13:11:56] <Shiftere> it tells you your immediate value per point, so you would have to sim every point

[2023-01-04 13:29:40] <+Moai> so you take the socket
[2023-01-04 13:29:44] <+beckto> you will eventually get the socket though
[2023-01-04 13:29:55] <Pro2Tabletop> feels bad

[2023-01-04 13:30:15] <+beckto> yes
[2023-01-04 13:30:19] <%+Twistoflemon> that feels really bad and I just took a slight upgrade
[2023-01-04 13:30:36] <vishu_tw> think going for the sockets is something you should do when you are almost bis right else not worth?
[2023-01-04 13:30:37] <+flockzy> I understand it just fine.  It's not exactly complicated.  lol.
[2023-01-04 13:30:40] <+beckto> Do you need the upgrade asap?
[2023-01-04 13:30:47] <+dancingfalcon> And i think that‘s cause ysemeralds are earth-gems… the ysemeralds give me mastery and haste.
[2023-01-04 13:30:52] <%+Kyuyan> @dancingfalcon if they're Earth ysemeralds, they proc mastery. Earth procs mastery
[2023-01-04 13:30:57] <+Xulu_> Having the alternative reward from the vault as the only way of getting socket upgrades is the problem IMO.

[2023-01-04 13:31:09] <+Moai> the socket makes so if the vault is garbanzo you still get something
[2023-01-04 13:31:10] <Patrikhg> i prefered when we farmed sockets and not getting them from vaults
[2023-01-04 13:31:12] <drunce> or 7th lol
[2023-01-04 13:31:22] <Calphurnious> I noticed on one of my not geared characters they get only 2 tokens too. What item level do you get 6 tokens at?
[2023-01-04 13:31:26] <%+Twistoflemon> lol
[2023-01-04 13:31:30] <ronannwow> hi @naguura I watched your video guide on Yt about balance is the guide ok for now or it will be another update? ty
[2023-01-04 13:31:33] <+Failtris> I DONT WANT SOCKETS NODDERS
[2023-01-04 13:31:35] <+OffBeatOddity> You're stupid skermzBats
[2023-01-04 13:31:41] <+Moai> you are greedy :)
[2023-01-04 13:31:47] <+beckto> you have a beneficial idea....but the argument is valid
[2023-01-04 13:31:48] <%NaturalJoel> I want free tokens
[2023-01-04 13:31:50] <nagkinn> that would be to easy and blizz don't like us getting stuff easily
[2023-01-04 13:31:52] <+Rainloop> what does token do
[2023-01-04 13:31:54] <+nilbusmaximus> @Calphurnious its based on choices you have. 2 tokens per piece of loot in vault, up to the 6
[2023-01-04 13:31:59] <Darklott> I hope they actually add getting 2 choices from the vault as catch up later then you can get tokens and an item every week
[2023-01-04 13:32:04] <vishu_tw> I'm stupid => selfknowledge is the first step to move forward!
[2023-01-04 13:32:05] <TraXaut> ye you dumb, let me suffer in piece for more weeks when i open my vault
[2023-01-04 13:32:05] <+OffBeatOddity> skermzOughta c'mon, put 'em up
[2023-01-04 13:32:10] <MattPascual> The vault is also so generous
[2023-01-04 13:32:11] <+flockzy> Who was insulting her?  That's not nice. O:
