[2022-12-09 12:16:05] <@^StreamElements>* Please do NOT backseat. Although this may not be a NP rule, it is 1. annoying to tell someone how to RP (please apply to the server to RP yourself) but 2. it could lead to !meta information which could then result in Jay getting a ban from the server. Backseating can/will result in timeouts or bans.
