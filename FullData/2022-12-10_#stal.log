[2022-12-10 09:52:00] <%BowlingBobby> They liked the new WoW expansion because it took elements of gameplay from Guild Wars 2 Madge and I said what I said
[2022-12-10 09:52:04] <%gama41> the story is all over the place sadly
[2022-12-10 09:52:11] <%OdinDuh> skip cutscnes etc level speedrun

[2022-12-10 13:23:57] <Snowwraith> A lot of Korean games tone down the grind when localising it, sometimes not well.
[2022-12-10 13:23:57] <%beepboopA2> and its anime this gotta be a gacha stalalaLMAO
[2022-12-10 13:23:58] <@%Laww__> i just dont understand why they region block

[2022-12-10 13:24:03] <%bellcross321> publisher means their words have weight, if they say "make it pay to win" the devs will ahve no choice but to do so
[2022-12-10 13:24:08] <!%SateLight_ed> i'm just gonna stick to JP ver i think
[2022-12-10 13:24:09] <@%Laww__> if they region block u from this game stal i will fight them
[2022-12-10 13:24:10] <%Krilwya> well we gotta wait and see I really hope gear is only grind and no p2w or p2f cause it takes years to reach decent gear
[2022-12-10 13:24:15] <restartdreamertv> @beepboopA2 its not gacha more like battlepass ^^
[2022-12-10 13:24:17] <%Resuta_Ri> eng lost ark just lesser p2w

[2022-12-10 13:54:58] <%valfayr> @Narnun its "a bit more" than that my dude lol
[2022-12-10 13:55:12] <%$JoshCraze> First horizon best horizon anyway

[2022-12-10 13:55:34] <!%SateLight_ed> they direct where the game will lean towards
[2022-12-10 13:55:37] <Snowwraith> It just wants to be The Oscars so it's a "Direction" award like a Director award.
[2022-12-10 13:55:40] <@%Laww__> the translator is so nervous
[2022-12-10 13:55:44] <%thargonian> its like film direction
[2022-12-10 13:55:48] <%SkibolPatryk> is it like what the game aims for?
[2022-12-10 13:55:55] <%$CocoSG> is like aesthetic and executions
[2022-12-10 13:56:03] <%$JoshCraze> I mean horizon just rips off farcry so.... farcry devs should probably get the reward if it won stalalaLMAO

[2022-12-10 13:56:12] <Narnun> Direction is the view you are offer, so everything in terms of art+gameplay
[2022-12-10 13:56:12] <HeidahnConrad> well this is kind of a burn on a already scorched area for horizon cuz they dissed elden ring's UI
[2022-12-10 13:56:14] <%valfayr> yea that too stal
[2022-12-10 13:56:15] <@%Laww__> execution is a good way to explain it

[2022-12-10 14:00:23] <%xbawbx> @fryden_ true but both are still triple AAA titles that can hold their own. Forbidden West just didn't live up to Zero Dawn imo.
[2022-12-10 14:00:25] <Narnun> It's quite complex
[2022-12-10 14:00:26] <%ThermiThorus> with heavy focus on customization

Unfortunately, this life is not sustainable anymore.. I decided to look for a job in the city and found out COVID is a thing. This can't be it.. that's impossible! I'm scared, terrified and unemployed. I resort to a life on the internet as a VTuber.. with a voice changer. Yes, it is fake. My entire life is a lie just like Chi.

[2022-12-10 20:10:52] <%Raikyr_> you can have an off hand melee or shield
[2022-12-10 20:11:04] <%MishaMerina> can't you do that with a shortbow too?
[2022-12-10 20:11:05] <%Keld__> stalalaBoomer I'll make it I brought my walking stick
[2022-12-10 20:11:15] <%Raikyr_> Shortbow was 2 handed I think
[2022-12-10 20:11:34] <%Matthies7> Realistically it can also be fired more accurately much faster than a normal bow, but turn based games sort generally negate that when an action is your turn no matter what
[2022-12-10 20:11:38] <%MishaMerina> rally? I thought for sure the flying guy uses an axe and shortbow?
