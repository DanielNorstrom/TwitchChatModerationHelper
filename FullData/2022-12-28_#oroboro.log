[2022-12-28 04:09:56] <Coiling_Oracle> @KungFuAndrew not in the sense that usually means, and no. it's a roguelite, not an rpg really. so you're going to do runs gradually getting stronger. what sets this game apart is that it has a huge amount of dialogue for between runs
[2022-12-28 04:09:57] <nola_epeeist> @KungFuAndrew You have to beat bosses each run. The game has a ton of content. You'll have maxed out all the upgrades before you finish the full story. But I don't know if all the deaths needed to complete the story count a grinding.

[2022-12-28 04:44:37] <TheGazingStar> deflects projectiles by dashing, it's basically more i-frames and it's super fun to use
[2022-12-28 04:44:38] <dbabcock74> It deflects as you dash
[2022-12-28 04:44:44] <+Auvreanea> The main reason you usually dodge is to get away from projectiles, which would now deflect

[2022-12-28 05:08:16] <SteveSketches> @KungFuAndrew And the gods also start using their unique brands of mumbo jumbo to mess with you while you fight the mobs.  That's why the mobs had shields, athena was protecting them.
[2022-12-28 05:08:17] <ARowanAshen> The dash
[2022-12-28 05:08:18] <KBTonthree> so just dash

[2022-12-28 05:08:19] <zehdre> Your abilities "that deflect". So if you dash through someone.
[2022-12-28 05:08:19] <%keeran8894> @KungFuAndrew yes, but also the god that you enraged helps the mobs. you might've noticed some of those enemies had a shield? that was athena booning them

[2022-12-28 05:15:23] <LabyrinthianCorn> @KungFuAndrew When you're first starting out, a little bit. But when you get good you can make a powerful build out of pretty much any RNG. And there are a lot of ways to strategize steer the RNG as well
[2022-12-28 05:15:32] <+ASAP_Smash1> @KungFuAndrew I mean you'll always get good stuff, but the build oro has right now is ungu bunga.
[2022-12-28 05:15:36] <7stringarmy> i think i got hydra second or 3rd try once i started using bow
[2022-12-28 05:15:39] <bobthemutant> 3 diamonds to make a pickaxe
[2022-12-28 05:15:41] <zehdre> @KungFuAndrew Not always. Builds can always get strong once you know what to take and it comes down to skill, but early on it can be a bit random.
[2022-12-28 05:15:43] <7stringarmy> i hated bow at first but now its one of my favs
[2022-12-28 05:15:50] <%KungFuAndrew> Thank you again chat oroHeart Super helpful!

[2022-12-28 05:16:08] <Zreaper_> I liked bow alot initially and then I liked the aspects even more
[2022-12-28 05:16:10] <SteveSketches> @KungFuAndrew The RNG is part of the fun.  At first it pressures you, then you start fighting back, and then eventually you learn how to exploit it for all it's worth.

[2022-12-28 05:16:18] <nola_epeeist> healing 10% health per chamber is 30% healing over 3 chambers
[2022-12-28 05:16:18] <%rav3n1473> @oroboro next boss is a bitch, good luck I died to him more then anything else. Recommend getting anything that improves speed/dash speed good luck!
[2022-12-28 05:16:22] <!%KayleNikita> my one complaint is here
[2022-12-28 05:16:23] <+The_NightShader> Oro that's what i thought too but those are really good
[2022-12-28 05:16:31] <Foo_Man_Shu> its fine, strimmer is god gamer :)
[2022-12-28 05:16:34] <%KungFuAndrew> @SteveSketches I'm usually not a fan of that sort of thing, but I'm enjoying watching at least
[2022-12-28 05:16:35] <+ASAP_Smash1> Heartbreak strike + divine dash is just a flat damage buff that can be upgraded with an invulnerable dash.

[2022-12-28 05:19:45] <%KungFuAndrew> @EdgarAlanBroLIVE I think most of us feel that way about souls games if we see a first-timer, not weird at all
[2022-12-28 05:19:50] <Zreaper_> there is RNG but even just 1 good boon can carry you through an entire run

[2022-12-28 05:24:49] <zxthed> affirmation, yea
[2022-12-28 05:24:50] <!%TheBiqBadWolf> diff league is strong
[2022-12-28 05:24:51] <%KungFuAndrew> What his "cast" is that his special?
[2022-12-28 05:24:51] <It_Is_A_Moose> Not bad.

[2022-12-28 05:25:05] <nola_epeeist> @KungFuAndrew That's the red stones he throws sometimes
[2022-12-28 05:25:08] <+Auvreanea> 3 would be good with bronze skin
[2022-12-28 05:25:11] <SteveSketches> Different League
[2022-12-28 05:25:12] <%mythmakroxymore> You probably used your luck on hp grabs
[2022-12-28 05:25:13] <%Kaine_san> different league = 45% damage reduction kinda crazy
[2022-12-28 05:25:13] <%keeran8894> i mean, will you get even MORE HP?
[2022-12-28 05:25:13] <%EdgarAlanBroLIVE> nab that shit
[2022-12-28 05:25:15] <GoddamnWizard> @KungFuAndrew it's like his spell ability, he has none right now
[2022-12-28 05:25:15] <%rav3n1473> You get different league you probs beat game I trust in you
[2022-12-28 05:25:17] <zehdre> Go with your gut
[2022-12-28 05:25:17] <%KungFuAndrew> @KungFuAndrew Gotcha!
[2022-12-28 05:25:18] <LabyrinthianCorn> Would that stack with the 5% from earlier?
[2022-12-28 05:25:22] <zxthed> nah its not too late
[2022-12-28 05:25:23] <Aruvella> Life Affirmation is a great pic here
[2022-12-28 05:25:26] <gladosinthemoon> 2
[2022-12-28 05:25:27] <Zreaper_> Both are good. Life Affirmation earlier on would have been insane
[2022-12-28 05:25:29] <SteveSketches> It stacks.
[2022-12-28 05:25:29] <WraithX23> @KungFuAndrew special is the alternate weapon attack. the bow has an arrow barrage/volley type attack
[2022-12-28 05:25:29] <%KungFuAndrew> @GoddamnWizard Thank you, also your name is epic :D
[2022-12-28 05:25:30] <gladosinthemoon> 3
[2022-12-28 05:25:30] <+ASAP_Smash1> yeah you have been getting a lot of vigor, might synergize better with life aff.
[2022-12-28 05:25:30] <%rav3n1473> I believe in the oro
[2022-12-28 05:25:33] <%+Zudah_Head> you need to actually gain health items for life affirmation to work.
[2022-12-28 05:25:38] <%EdgarAlanBroLIVE> imma mald
[2022-12-28 05:25:39] <karyotic> Definitely not too late
[2022-12-28 05:25:43] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> the game gives you more of stuff you have synergy for iirc
[2022-12-28 05:25:47] [Notification] KungFuAndrew gifted a Tier 1 sub to GoddamnWizard! They have given 92 Gift Subs in the channel!
[2022-12-28 05:25:49] <%rav3n1473> I’d do different league but life is also good
[2022-12-28 05:25:55] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> should get plenty of health
[2022-12-28 05:25:56] <ARowanAshen> oh hard decision here but it’s all you
[2022-12-28 05:25:59] <%rav3n1473> And it is epic
[2022-12-28 05:26:02] <%GoddamnWizard> @KungFuAndrew Thanks!
[2022-12-28 05:26:05] <%KungFuAndrew> I just wanted to hear you say that lmfao
[2022-12-28 05:26:08] <BraverThunder9> go life
[2022-12-28 05:26:10] <!%TheBiqBadWolf> They're both really strong @Oroboro I think diff league is better tho
[2022-12-28 05:26:12] <multibacking> you still have one life, so life affirmation can help to have more HP after losing that life
[2022-12-28 05:26:13] <%vitriolicjunior> 2
[2022-12-28 05:26:14] <%KungFuAndrew> @GoddamnWizard I was sold on the name LUL
[2022-12-28 05:26:16] <%rav3n1473> But it’s better early game in my opinion
[2022-12-28 05:26:17] <+mtldry> not too late for more health upgrade

[2022-12-28 05:26:30] <%mythmakroxymore> 3 is good whether the run goes long or shorter. 2 is better the earlier you  get it
[2022-12-28 05:26:32] <DuoScratch> Life affermation now, cuz purple is rare, and different league fish later for a rarer one.
[2022-12-28 05:26:45] <+ASAP_Smash1> diff league, good choice.
[2022-12-28 05:26:46] <mrboogie86> its an epic
[2022-12-28 05:26:53] <zehdre> Epic PogU
[2022-12-28 05:26:59] <%vitriolicjunior> you can sell it later
[2022-12-28 05:27:00] <%+Zudah_Head> it being epic only matters if he can gain use out of it
[2022-12-28 05:27:02] <!%Sir__Nova> could also risk taking 2, and try selling it fo big bucks
[2022-12-28 05:27:08] <%+HungryGrunty> 10% of 330 doh
[2022-12-28 05:27:11] <%keeran8894> do you want to get more HP? or more efficient use of the HP?
[2022-12-28 05:27:20] <%rav3n1473> @oroboro don’t get a lot of life chances late game. Very specific
[2022-12-28 05:27:23] <+ASAP_Smash1> @Sir__Nova yeah thats actually a g ood idea
[2022-12-28 05:27:25] <kombushi> life affermation for the sustain. it's in the name!
[2022-12-28 05:27:27] <%Kaine_san> if you dont find any more heart chambers it kinda sucks
[2022-12-28 05:27:32] <SteveSketches> A strong choice.
[2022-12-28 05:27:33] <!AuroraUnit486> yeah epic rarity is nice and all but it doesnt matter if your rng ends up bad and you get no more hp ups
[2022-12-28 05:27:34] <%rav3n1473> Yessss
[2022-12-28 05:27:35] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> healing is usually unreliable in this game in my experience, besides the sword upgrade

[2022-12-28 05:44:33] <%rav3n1473> @oroboro ha I knew you’d say that with my awesome reverse psychology I knew I’d get you to talk to them all. Psh read you like a book oro
[2022-12-28 05:44:35] <7stringarmy> lets see how oro runs some shit builds
[2022-12-28 05:44:37] <%OptPlaysGames> @oroboro should we answer your questions like that or is that backseating? oroLUL
[2022-12-28 05:44:43] <!%KayleNikita> for my doubt of you getting that far
[2022-12-28 05:44:44] <+snibbro> Did he gift skelly yet?
[2022-12-28 05:44:49] <%KungFuAndrew> @SteveSketches There's definitely a lot of enthusiasm for this game in chat, for sure!
[2022-12-28 05:45:00] <nola_epeeist> The codex keeps track of who you have already given a gift to (they'll have 1 heart)
[2022-12-28 05:45:11] <%everypopisanemergency> PvE stream??
[2022-12-28 05:45:12] <%SteveSketches> sketchyShrug It's a roguelike for people that don't like roguelikes.
[2022-12-28 05:45:15] <+ASAP_Smash1> oro going to be thirsting for that heartbreak strike from now on.
[2022-12-28 05:45:17] <!%KayleNikita> dude, for a 4th run, that was NUTS
[2022-12-28 05:45:30] <%SteveSketches> Even when you lose you get rewarded with excellent dialogue, story, and fabulous art and music.
[2022-12-28 05:45:38] <7stringarmy> that was easily an endgame build, it was so strong
[2022-12-28 05:45:44] <%keeran8894> @KungFuAndrew i understand that, but the game is a rogue like, every run you unlock new stuff to try, new builds and every one is meant to be quick, like 20 mins-ish it's addicting. a lot more fun than you think, it's not so much a chore, but more like "what is the next run going to be like!? :D "
[2022-12-28 05:45:49] <powerless_imp0> rogue lites are the main thing I play aside from elden ring at this point. So addicting
[2022-12-28 05:45:53] <Ceomin> This game makes every other roguelike on the genre worse by comparison. They just cant compete
[2022-12-28 05:46:00] <Coiling_Oracle> Sadge
[2022-12-28 05:46:13] <powerless_imp0> agh Hades' voice actor is so damn good
[2022-12-28 05:46:21] <Regretful> This game is great at full price and it does go on sale too
[2022-12-28 05:46:25] VIEWERS: 658
[2022-12-28 05:46:28] <Cerberex> free money
[2022-12-28 05:46:31] <%GoddamnWizard> Yeah, gold is one time only so great
[2022-12-28 05:46:32] <%KungFuAndrew> @keeran8894 I get you! I'm not a fan of that type of gameplay. rogue legacy hammered it out of me with it's late-game grind. But it's fun to watch!
[2022-12-28 05:46:34] <!%KayleNikita> yep
[2022-12-28 05:46:36] <powerless_imp0> that is a very valuable one yes
[2022-12-28 05:46:39] <%$TheSortingHelmet> FUCK YEAH HADES
[2022-12-28 05:46:40] <%SteveSketches> Keepsake shuffling is a core mechanic.  Very fun.
[2022-12-28 05:46:44] <!%TheBiqBadWolf> I didn't get my first clear till like 23 or 25 lol, so that far for your 4th run is insane @Oroboro
[2022-12-28 05:46:52] <DuoScratch> extra challenge for extra stuff
[2022-12-28 05:46:53] <%SteveSketches> Infernal Troves are also fun.
[2022-12-28 05:46:56] <+DjDonkeySausage> Get the keepsake
[2022-12-28 05:47:02] <+DjDonkeySausage> It’s worth
[2022-12-28 05:47:08] <%+xPoppinSmokex> glad you jumped on this one.
[2022-12-28 05:47:09] <%SteveSketches> This game's just fun, okay?  All the choices are good.
[2022-12-28 05:47:13] <%mythmakroxymore> Infernal troves award Gems, Darkness, Healing and Money if you beat them fast enough.
[2022-12-28 05:47:18] <%Pogarithmic> Both are good bawkSanta
[2022-12-28 05:47:18] <%rav3n1473> @oroboro what weapons have you gotten to play with so far?
[2022-12-28 05:47:23] <nola_epeeist> It's like 1 gem room on a run to get the other one. so it's not a big deal either way
[2022-12-28 05:47:36] <%mythmakroxymore> Why is she over there?
[2022-12-28 05:47:39] <+ASAP_Smash1> Meg is HAWT

[2022-12-28 05:47:52] <7stringarmy> those runs where you only get 1 upgrade in the first whole zone are fun
[2022-12-28 05:47:54] <%mythmakroxymore> SHE CALLED YOU OUT FOR LOSING
[2022-12-28 05:48:13] <%KungFuAndrew> I used to know a woman that sounded just like Meg, minus the distortion of course
[2022-12-28 05:48:18] <@%Pallydan9K> seems everyone does that

[2022-12-28 05:48:55] <Regretful> I recommend Dion's special when you get a chance
[2022-12-28 05:49:00] <%+xPoppinSmokex> you can stack the casts

[2022-12-28 05:49:31] <%Rattlecan_AZ> Each will cost more as you level them.
[2022-12-28 05:49:35] <crimsonconflict> first playthrough for real?

[2022-12-28 05:49:36] <%rav3n1473> @oroboro yelling at us like he’s not mad, just disappointed
[2022-12-28 05:49:43] <%mythmakroxymore> Even Crush Shot is fine in the end
[2022-12-28 05:49:43] <%keeran8894> it IS cast oriented, but would also be useful even if unupgraded, i think. You'd be able to debuff a boss and then go to town with regular attacks
[2022-12-28 05:49:48] <%+xPoppinSmokex> damn i want to jump back into hades now

[2022-12-28 05:51:52] <!%KayleNikita> @Regretful sorry if i sounded offputting, just the game has specific wording and oro gets confused enough on his own LUL
[2022-12-28 05:51:58] <crimsonconflict> true..cant believe you haven't played til now
[2022-12-28 05:51:58] <Regretful> I believe it recommends controller when launching it @ASAP_Smash1
[2022-12-28 05:52:04] <%Rattlecan_AZ> check the sparkling box
[2022-12-28 05:52:08] <7stringarmy> a lot of people prefer controller I think, but i just like keyboard more than controlers
[2022-12-28 05:52:08] <boogalyboo> how was the hades battle at the end i missed it

[2022-12-28 05:55:57] <%+N7_Indra> Ares boons are def a bit different from everyone else
[2022-12-28 05:55:58] <%$TheSortingHelmet> blade rift op
[2022-12-28 05:56:03] <%mythmakroxymore> Blades are ticks of damage, cursed are a delayed burst of damage.
[2022-12-28 05:56:03] <+dm_jesse> is this 2d Elden ring?

[2022-12-28 05:56:10] <!%TheBiqBadWolf> @KayleNikita Oh yea, I know that the boons were strong, he had an actual clear build I would go for lol. But I'm saying that I used the next weapon he hasn't unlocked a ton, not knowing how bad they were
[2022-12-28 05:56:16] <%mythmakroxymore> Both have vastly diff. Synergy

[2022-12-28 05:58:31] <nola_epeeist> @N7_Indra that is definitely not true. Go watch a fresh file speedrun and you'll see what I mean. Plus his cast means you can't stick a boss with boiling blood. So you give up boss damage for enemy damage. So it's a tradeoff.
[2022-12-28 05:58:31] <!%TheBiqBadWolf> Those were my favorite weapon, but I didn't know how bad they were back then lol

[2022-12-28 06:25:21] <Hooded_Lay> @Pazetic_Ocean Keepsakes, and some mirror stuff may help, but it's mostly from keepsakes.

[2022-12-28 07:01:42] <!%KayleNikita> ambrosia
[2022-12-28 07:01:42] <nola_epeeist> can get darkness easier than ambrosia
[2022-12-28 07:01:44] <LabyrinthianCorn> ambrosia is very scarce
[2022-12-28 07:01:45] <!%xperimentalsubject> I would keep Ambrosia
[2022-12-28 07:01:50] <Regretful> oh it's ambrosia nvm keep
[2022-12-28 07:01:51] <zxthed> ambrosia-you'll get more eventually
[2022-12-28 07:01:51] <smokeythekitkat> It's a very good deal now, and it'll be a while before you can use Ambrosia
[2022-12-28 07:01:52] <%dustbuni> its for gifting to gods
[2022-12-28 07:01:52] <!%xperimentalsubject> It's the Minotaur Boss drop
[2022-12-28 07:01:54] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> Ambrosia are really hard to get later on
[2022-12-28 07:01:57] <%keeran8894> you give ambrosia to get to people to like you. not wirth IMO
[2022-12-28 07:01:58] <%OptPlaysGames> it’s tempting but ambrosia is rare
[2022-12-28 07:01:59] <%beau_xo> i think darkness is more valuable at this point in the game tho
[2022-12-28 07:02:02] <SuburbanSocrates> Ambrosia is important for reasons that would be a spoiler.

[2022-12-28 07:03:02] <Legionofbacon> Or you could just not die, its like infinite death's defiance.
[2022-12-28 07:03:03] <smokeythekitkat> Yup, could be the difference between a dub and a death
[2022-12-28 07:03:05] <smokeythekitkat> I say worth
[2022-12-28 07:03:07] <7stringarmy> otherwise its totally not worth
[2022-12-28 07:03:09] <%keeran8894> i mean amrbosia is not that rare later on...
[2022-12-28 07:03:10] <%beau_xo> you can get ambrosia back through limited offers as well

[2022-12-28 07:03:30] <+DanG519> U can trade 2 diamonds for ambrosia
[2022-12-28 07:03:31] <kingpinxxx> a normal gamer may find it worth it...but ur the god gamer
[2022-12-28 07:03:32] <SuburbanSocrates> It's a lot of grinding to get everything. Once you get good at the game, the grind gets faster.
[2022-12-28 07:03:34] <7stringarmy> just gitgud, no need for death defiance
[2022-12-28 07:03:36] <%Benny_EFSS> I think its worth, there are ways to get guranteed ambro later
[2022-12-28 07:03:43] <%radish_n> the darkness trade is really good

[2022-12-28 07:05:58] <%Benny_EFSS> shield is fun tho. spear is good too
[2022-12-28 07:05:58] <+snibbro> Spear was my first win

[2022-12-28 07:06:12] <7stringarmy> long reach on it too
[2022-12-28 07:06:17] <gabs_hp> spear dash attack is great
[2022-12-28 07:06:35] <%beau_xo> skewer and recall is awesome gameplay
[2022-12-28 07:06:37] <%+N7_Indra> Spear is a carry weapon tbh oroLUL

[2022-12-28 07:06:53] <%+N7_Indra> A lot of people I know got their first wins with the spear
[2022-12-28 07:06:54] <7stringarmy> the spear throw is good with the right build
[2022-12-28 07:07:00] <%+Dazitup> sad but true FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-28 07:07:03] <Alextreides> this weapon is amazing
[2022-12-28 07:07:05] <+Sir_robothy> also recalling the spear does backstab damage
[2022-12-28 07:07:10] <Legionofbacon> Compared to all the other weapons, yes, sword sucks.
[2022-12-28 07:07:16] <+ASAP_Smash1> spear recall has a lot of backstab perks too
[2022-12-28 07:07:16] <thesacredwalrus> Spear is cracked
[2022-12-28 07:07:17] <7stringarmy> spear is 2nd favorite weapon, I love it
[2022-12-28 07:07:19] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> sword is the best weapon imo actually
[2022-12-28 07:07:21] <%Pogarithmic> I wanted to love the spear, but I couldn't really get it to work as well as other weps
[2022-12-28 07:07:28] <smokeythekitkat> Screw the purple, use the spear!!
[2022-12-28 07:07:29] <+snibbro> Fresh start runs with sword are so cool tho
[2022-12-28 07:07:29] <!%KayleNikita> i was never a big fan of it
[2022-12-28 07:07:30] <!%xperimentalsubject> COPIUM
[2022-12-28 07:07:31] <%+Dazitup> the spear acts like it has hammer buffs already. then you get hammer buff for it and your just like O_O
[2022-12-28 07:07:34] <%+N7_Indra> Sword sucks but later on you can make the sword SUPER fucking good imo
[2022-12-28 07:07:35] <nola_epeeist> @Legionofbacon There are worse
[2022-12-28 07:07:36] <+The_NightShader> idk about that
[2022-12-28 07:07:37] <+wingledank> spear is great but i like other weapons than sword
[2022-12-28 07:07:39] <7stringarmy> sword is one of my least favorite weapons

[2022-12-28 07:07:54] <Aruvella> Spear is great in its own right.
[2022-12-28 07:07:54] <ZelaznyWilk> the spear throw is almost no brain build with right boons
[2022-12-28 07:07:59] <!%xperimentalsubject> Carry Bow time
[2022-12-28 07:08:01] <+aaron4125> All you need to do with the sword is dash atk twice then special then repeat
[2022-12-28 07:08:01] <Aruvella> A lot less to worry about build wise.
[2022-12-28 07:08:05] <%$TheSortingHelmet> Spoilers chat Spoilers no spoilers
[2022-12-28 07:08:12] <%radish_n> the better sword combo is special dash attack and then it pumps
[2022-12-28 07:08:24] <%Syoxin> Shield is really fun
[2022-12-28 07:08:25] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> sword special builds are pretty insane too
[2022-12-28 07:08:27] <ARowanAshen> I think it comes to preference in the end

[2022-12-28 07:38:10] <+TheAssumingMage> pick the fish
[2022-12-28 07:38:11] <YamiXx> oh man LUL

[2022-12-28 07:38:15] <PungentMango> PepeLaugh surely you dont anger the king of gods
[2022-12-28 07:38:15] <+Foo18> pos will murder you if you pick zuess
[2022-12-28 07:38:16] <powerless_imp0> feesj
[2022-12-28 07:38:16] <+ASAP_Smash1> go with zues so you can actually get something good
[2022-12-28 07:38:16] <+Nevarato> poseidon agro is tough to deal with
[2022-12-28 07:38:18] <+Darigazz> pick zeus so you don't have to fight against the lightning
[2022-12-28 07:38:18] <LabyrinthianCorn> chat talking crazy on Zeus dash
[2022-12-28 07:38:20] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> poseidon is harder to dodge iirc
[2022-12-28 07:38:22] <+aelxrd> ZUUS
[2022-12-28 07:38:24] <carrmig> poseidon trial is harder, pick poseidon imo
[2022-12-28 07:38:26] <Legionofbacon> I would do Zeus
[2022-12-28 07:38:27] <+Nevarato> pick poseidon
[2022-12-28 07:38:29] <raoh05> PepeLaugh
[2022-12-28 07:38:29] <%cuttyriver420> zeus
[2022-12-28 07:38:30] <7stringarmy> dont ilsten to chat
[2022-12-28 07:38:35] <crimsonconflict> Zeus would do you
[2022-12-28 07:38:35] <+Foo18> posiedon wrath will destroy your dash spam
[2022-12-28 07:38:37] <%keeran8894> i would do poseidon and deal with Zeus later
[2022-12-28 07:38:39] <%Pogarithmic> Zeus is amazing if you get a ton of Zeus boons. but otherwise, is a little meh
[2022-12-28 07:38:40] <%+N7_Indra> Pick Poseidon first its easier to deal with Zeus's shit

[2022-12-28 07:39:23] <Gebrant> I love the water dash
[2022-12-28 07:39:24] <%keeran8894> usually REPLACING one boon for anotehr gives a huge boost to rarity, but also angers the other god
[2022-12-28 07:39:26] <+ASAP_Smash1> 1
[2022-12-28 07:39:28] <7stringarmy> dash isnt the best with a bow lol
[2022-12-28 07:39:34] <nola_epeeist> dash good, but treasure helpful. And hydraulic outstanding

[2022-12-28 07:40:03] <+aelxrd> not only did he choose poseidon first, he replaced zeus's gift. i'd be pissed to tbh
[2022-12-28 07:40:04] <dagrotus> this dash is much stronger
[2022-12-28 07:40:07] <+ASAP_Smash1> tidal dash is aight with bow because it can get enemies off you

[2022-12-28 07:51:30] <nola_epeeist> @mrtapdawg I find it funny because chat can't do math. Lots of this stuff can be calculated and has an answer. But people be like "Oro do the thing I like that improves your build by 4% instead of the of the thing that helps by 50%"
[2022-12-28 07:51:30] <%keeran8894> so about the second one... how much slower does it charge tho??

[2022-12-28 07:51:54] <Gebrant> but your instinct seems to be to charge right on them lol
[2022-12-28 07:52:06] <thesacredwalrus> @keeran8894 probably like 66 percent slower
[2022-12-28 07:52:08] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> looks like it shows you the distance, seems really far...
[2022-12-28 07:52:37] <zxthed> point blank is much more reliable than sniper shot

[2022-12-28 07:53:07] <%+rnblaze> @keeran8894 Noticeably more, but the damage boos t + splash damage make up for it. Plus w/ this dash build it won't matter much

[2022-12-28 07:54:31] <powerless_imp0> I think there's a line on the charge bar that lets you know what the distance for the buff is?
[2022-12-28 07:54:34] <%Benny_EFSS> there is a visual indication
[2022-12-28 07:54:38] <crimsonconflict> yeah sniper shot is bleh

[2022-12-28 07:54:40] <nola_epeeist> @Jaylangis Oro's decisions fine. I'm triggered by the bad advice in chat by people who can't do basic math.
[2022-12-28 07:54:45] <!%Sir__Nova> @oroboro Hold up a second, hold the charge, I think there is a line that shows where the effect starts

[2022-12-28 08:05:03] <Thumbdrives> 3 is trhe best one
[2022-12-28 08:05:04] <Legionofbacon> free damage
[2022-12-28 08:05:05] <%Pogarithmic> Support Fire PogChampius
[2022-12-28 08:05:05] <dagrotus> 3 is broken ye
[2022-12-28 08:05:05] <Gebrant> oh yeah
[2022-12-28 08:05:08] <%OptPlaysGames> support fire is really good
[2022-12-28 08:05:09] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> or 2
[2022-12-28 08:05:10] <+Jaylangis> 3 is basically plasma shrimp in RoR2
[2022-12-28 08:05:14] <+ASAP_Smash1> 3
[2022-12-28 08:05:16] <%$MrPwner911> support fire is pretty good
[2022-12-28 08:05:17] <Thumbdrives> trust
[2022-12-28 08:05:17] <+Jaylangis> except worse
[2022-12-28 08:05:18] <%Pogarithmic> Less great for this build
[2022-12-28 08:05:18] <yepboomer> that will work on ytour spread attack as well
[2022-12-28 08:05:20] <crimsonconflict> it's good for fast builds
[2022-12-28 08:05:21] <Thumbdrives> its good af
[2022-12-28 08:05:22] <!%xperimentalsubject> It's still worth NODDERS
[2022-12-28 08:05:22] <+Nevarato> 3 is only good if u use ur special attack
[2022-12-28 08:05:23] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> 2 is best call imo
[2022-12-28 08:05:26] <nola_epeeist> chat can't math
[2022-12-28 08:05:27] <%beau_xo> 3 feels good and looks cool
[2022-12-28 08:05:29] <%+rnblaze> bruh, hit with attack
[2022-12-28 08:05:30] <Thumbdrives> yes
[2022-12-28 08:05:31] <sennoh> 3 is not good for this build, call is better support
[2022-12-28 08:05:31] <SkeletalJester> 3 hands down
[2022-12-28 08:05:37] <%$MrPwner911> stiil good, same w/ 2
[2022-12-28 08:05:38] <Aruvella> You'll get use out of 3
[2022-12-28 08:05:41] <dagrotus> when you hit
[2022-12-28 08:05:41] <+The_Loch_Ness_M0nster> Try it with special
[2022-12-28 08:05:41] <7stringarmy> you'l;l still get more out of 3 than the others I think
[2022-12-28 08:05:42] <+stonehandsmagee> better than never using your call lol
[2022-12-28 08:05:43] <alylucky> both good
[2022-12-28 08:05:44] <Legionofbacon> I mean you don't like using call anyways
[2022-12-28 08:05:45] <%SleepySlee> Aight completely new playthrough of Hades? I'm sittin my butt down here for the night lol
[2022-12-28 08:05:49] <WyvernLink> all of these are good for you right now
[2022-12-28 08:05:50] <dthmagnet> do you have a call? if not, maybe take the call
[2022-12-28 08:05:51] <dagrotus> so if you hit multiple you fire multiple
[2022-12-28 08:05:51] <nola_epeeist> grab what you want
[2022-12-28 08:05:53] <%vitriolicjunior> try it
[2022-12-28 08:05:53] <+Jaylangis> you barely use your call
[2022-12-28 08:05:54] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> 3 good with special
[2022-12-28 08:05:54] <Alextreides> all are ok
[2022-12-28 08:06:00] <Thumbdrives> 3 is SSS tier across the board
[2022-12-28 08:06:02] <!%xperimentalsubject> 1k damage Call at full gauge
[2022-12-28 08:06:04] <+stonehandsmagee> arts call is nice tho ngl
[2022-12-28 08:06:05] <%OptPlaysGames> 321
[2022-12-28 08:06:05] <%GoddamnWizard> Just a reminder you can stick your cast in the boss to make them take even MORE damage
[2022-12-28 08:06:06] <powerless_imp0> it's free damage ultimately, at no cost to you
[2022-12-28 08:06:07] <nola_epeeist> you have to grab them all at least once at some point
[2022-12-28 08:06:08] <multibacking> @SleepySlee he just started.
[2022-12-28 08:06:12] <BobWeAdaBbyItsABoy> you take call if you dont have call. everything is broken if you upgrade it
[2022-12-28 08:06:23] <BobWeAdaBbyItsABoy> 3 is only broken if you have fast fire
[2022-12-28 08:06:25] <+The_Loch_Ness_M0nster> your boon works with special
[2022-12-28 08:06:28] <+jPhamPham> EZ
[2022-12-28 08:06:30] <%gortonimo> this game is deceptively difficult
[2022-12-28 08:06:32] <SkeletalJester> The cast is good, but charge meter vs free damage for attacking.
