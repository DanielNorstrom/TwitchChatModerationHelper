[2023-01-11 13:23:09] <%rainysama_> modCheck yelan
[2023-01-11 13:23:18] <nerfying> is 165 er with favonius enough
[2023-01-11 13:23:28] <%RandomNlcknamee> depends on your team comp
[2023-01-11 13:23:34] <%notNoctuua> !idp
[2023-01-11 13:23:47] <%RandomNlcknamee> and whether you're funneling energy for Yelan or not
[2023-01-11 13:24:05] <%RandomNlcknamee> but I'd say 150% ER is enough for C0 if you know what you're doing
[2023-01-11 13:24:07] <nerfying> i mean i want to use her on that tartaglia team, and bennet uses favonius too so 2 favonius in the team
[2023-01-11 13:24:21] <+kamioxz> i'd do more offensive weapon on her tho, but i'd say 165 er is good

[2023-01-11 13:38:59] <nerfying> ill die on the hill that most of 5 star weapons are broken

[2023-01-11 13:40:15] <nerfying> i mean if u think about it its almost impossible to beat someone in dmg if someone has a 5 star weapon and half decent artifacts
[2023-01-11 13:41:20] <%hawichii> i mean there is some where you obv can beat
[2023-01-11 13:41:40] <nerfying> if u have 4 star f2p weapons its almost impossible

[2023-01-11 13:42:08] <nerfying> im talking about crit weapons i should have said that
[2023-01-11 13:42:35] <%RandomNlcknamee> @nerfying, akasha leaderboard doesn't consider the weapon YOU have or you're using, only consider the artifacts and the theoretical dmg with a specific weapon
[2023-01-11 13:43:29] <nerfying> im not talking about akasha just in general, if someone has a 5 star crit weapon from limited its almost impossible to reach their character stat
