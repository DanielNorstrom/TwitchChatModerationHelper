[2023-01-02 11:48:08] <AntipainK> Just the raid rewards are not enough by a large margin. Leg books are so expensive, not to mention honing your alts taking a lot of gold...

[2023-01-02 14:58:28] <Furi321> they need to add a support where a % of ur damage heals the group
[2023-01-02 14:58:32] <ExGh0ost> would be awesome if we had more engravings tho but that would prob skyrockter dp's damage
[2023-01-02 14:58:33] <+daxxi26> yep I love support in all games, but in this game I dont have the feeling to getting more powerfull with my team, I'm just seeing me as a  save potion option

[2023-01-02 18:49:52] <%wolder1305> or same goes with heals

[2023-01-02 18:50:08] <+PointBlvnk> exactly
[2023-01-02 18:50:12] <+TwoPillows> does support need better visual feedback for themselves? how much damage they've blocked or something would be cool
[2023-01-02 18:50:18] <niosse93> or a character glow if buffed

[2023-01-02 18:50:36] <charli_hs> like an aura
[2023-01-02 18:50:37] <JiLotus> characters do get bubbles or effects
[2023-01-02 18:50:38] <+arcanegast> Macros have that
[2023-01-02 18:50:40] <+NotToxicNear> I only know i get buffed because 1 day in NA the battle text got enlarged and i never fixed it so in big text i see the buff lol
[2023-01-02 18:50:41] <Dessari> weak aura kek
[2023-01-02 18:50:42] <Yushiamo> Should the buff damage (the numbers), not show up on the attacker but the buffer. So the support can see big numbers
[2023-01-02 18:50:43] <%Butterman2141> I've seen some games where the supps see the extra dmg as small grey numbers so they know how much dmg they're adding to the raid
[2023-01-02 18:50:46] <%NovaB0mb> The HUD overall just needs more customizability and more options to show/tell these kinds of things
[2023-01-02 18:50:48] <Matts0_> yea needs graphic indicator
[2023-01-02 18:50:51] <yoromichi> YEP agreed
[2023-01-02 18:50:51] <%wolder1305> macro texts are only used to some point otherwise team doesnt know

[2023-01-02 18:51:07] <yoromichi> Even some debuffs from enemies can't be noticed sometimes
[2023-01-02 18:51:11] <%+thiezzy> I usually see the buffs when i get debuff or something

[2023-01-02 18:52:01] <layfon_god98> Just do like what league does, they have 'debuff' bars above the characters when they get CC'ed. So LAO can have 'buff bars' instead with the corresponding text
[2023-01-02 18:52:15] <iron2033> basically you want a weakauras :x

[2023-01-02 19:13:11] <%NovaB0mb> I feel like Arcana would be hard to change. If you lean too hard into the card rng, then it becomes too inconsistent
[2023-01-02 19:13:12] <mindpilgrim> now it becomes interesting
[2023-01-02 19:13:16] <charli_hs> arcana is indeed the hardest class

[2023-01-02 19:30:12] <xAzurrr> Surge is better about 20% when u play is perfect and u know the raid - Re is much better for new players and if u normal to good - i  played both i play 6 blades surge is much more punishing and re imo is better for bus

[2023-01-02 20:21:30] <@%+Shikiro> I unbanned him
[2023-01-02 20:21:31] <ap__varus> @ap__varus yes thats why most burst classes are also better than dps classes. which is exactly my point lol

[2023-01-02 20:21:50] <mel_mk2> cmooooooooon bro can we get a fucking opinion on my main too
[2023-01-02 20:21:55] <sta1os> Shock is harder to rob damage away from when boss phases constantly. On average the damage is similar.
[2023-01-02 20:21:56] <%lostsoulz1010> he might have to refresh
[2023-01-02 20:21:58] <OnlyDoggiee> Chatting my class is better Chatting this list is wrong Chatting my opinion matters more then KR Vet
[2023-01-02 20:22:00] <mel_mk2> I want your opinion

[2023-01-02 20:22:04] <loggylaggy> i thought it might be bad if he dps you out the same way as tai and shock
[2023-01-02 20:22:07] <%monts18> for me this is accurate
[2023-01-02 20:22:13] <+ppbfx> people are now scared of your fat finger :)

[2023-01-02 20:22:18] <+hedgehog_d_sonic> idk one of the people in my guild plays shock and still mvps over there other members in their static by alot
[2023-01-02 20:22:21] <+designation1> no offence but ive came into this stream asked 4 questions and ive learned nothing in 15 mins
[2023-01-02 20:22:21] <+trg50> all NA can pretty much say niothing as this tier list applies to KR and not NA
[2023-01-02 20:22:23] <+holybabyjesuss> Why is Mayhem getting gatekept?
[2023-01-02 20:22:24] <Hiczilla> I think it would be productive to compare gunlancer damage to the rest as well

[2023-01-02 20:22:27] <+mrfunknsunshine> i think all classes come down to skill imo
[2023-01-02 20:22:28] <loggylaggy> Shock is much better then tai im scrapper main

[2023-01-02 20:24:43] <TotallyNotNoodle> @hedgehog_d_sonic what about scouter vs reaper? Kappa
[2023-01-02 20:24:44] <+LingRanLi> imo tai feels strong because the floor is high, so its strong in the average group due to ease of play and uptime. But the ceiling is not as high so in really strong groups where everybody pushes ceiling its harder to do high damage relative to everyone else
[2023-01-02 20:24:46] <+designation1> What does everyone think will get buffed the most?
[2023-01-02 20:24:51] <jimpix9822> @hedgehog_d_sonic yeah even my scouter with 1500 and two level 9 gems get gate keep some times in brel unless i tell i do prokel for them
[2023-01-02 20:24:55] <@%+Shikiro> Tai has a bit more upkeep than Shock, but is faster and easier to get to places

[2023-01-02 20:25:42] <+hedgehog_d_sonic> @TotallyNotNoodle this is just from what ive seen it could be enitrely different it also depends they could just be gatekeeping you for better synergy which also happens
[2023-01-02 20:25:58] <+designation1> if berserkers gets buffed how do you think they will change it?
[2023-01-02 20:26:03] <+LingRanLi> imo tai feels strong because the floor is high, so its strong in the average group due to ease of play and uptime.

[2023-01-02 20:27:37] <TotallyNotNoodle> @hedgehog_d_sonic nah it's mostly about class discrimination, pugs has really poor knowledge of class synergies
[2023-01-02 20:27:37] <loggylaggy> it can’t beat the tai shock in a real dps race, even when atropine is used the difference is huge atk im sorry if im upset u
[2023-01-02 20:27:37] <%monts18> for me this is accurate

[2023-01-02 20:29:35] <%+littlefedora> i believe that those classes like shock or igniter, when you talk about the damage pie, if you miss something or you dont sync up with others, they are worst compared do consistant damage, because you dont have to worry much about damage windows
[2023-01-02 20:29:38] <+Pwndalicious> @mel_mk2 ye exactly, casue most transform cheese with 9/10 gems right now

[2023-01-02 20:31:22] <KlashCool> do you think transformation class are gonna get buffed ? if gatekept
[2023-01-02 20:31:33] <sta1os> Transformation classes are just reliable

[2023-01-02 20:32:01] <jeppexxx> i personally dont rly take scouter, scouter seems to be lacking damage of the ones ive seen
[2023-01-02 20:32:02] <eloose> i think nowadays gatekeeping is based on other things like experience and iLvL more than class specific in my case

[2023-01-02 20:32:18] <+legendofeggfriedrice> AT scouter needs more buff
