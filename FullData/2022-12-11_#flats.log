[2022-12-11 00:57:50] <ShowerBastard> @uvmac1 in low elo the "tierlist" of heroes is way different
[2022-12-11 00:57:50] <+baconbootyboi> your testing that gorillas mental fortitude rn
[2022-12-11 00:57:52] <harrow129> that dragon...
[2022-12-11 00:57:53] <kazuli_> they say the same thing
[2022-12-11 00:57:56] <alfabr09> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[2022-12-11 00:57:59] <talon824> @uvmac1 Especially at low tiers he’s not bad. The issue with bastion is #1 he is massive. At higher tiers, people with good aim will exploit his massive hitbox to kill him regardless of his above average Hp. And 2, he’s largely predictable. His nade jump is his only mobility and is exceedingly hard to use consistently, and his turret form, while strong, can’t bypass cover that higher players use
[2022-12-11 00:58:17] <harrow129> did no one notice that dragon???????????????
[2022-12-11 00:58:51] <WellbeWelloff> no

You spoke so eloquently about Overwatch and the state it’s in, I could tell in your emotional honesty that you really care about the game/community. I wish that you could help be on the dev creative team and help bring some of that art back to the game. Anyways just wanted to say I see you and thank you for your effort.

[2022-12-11 01:30:44] <estriel_> So i just saw your video about the Tank meta, and couldnt you argue that now you just have to be decent at more tanks instead of just playing a handful?
[2022-12-11 01:30:44] <+PresetThrust> @igoodvibe i have use all tanks besides ram, i use hog on enviromental maps but im useless with winton and everyone else besides hog to be honest. is there someone youd reccommend for this season?
[2022-12-11 01:30:44] <viera___> i'm not saying bad stuff anymore
[2022-12-11 01:30:45] <%+Pizzariuz> I mean it man they screw up S3 I might just leave
[2022-12-11 01:30:45] <SirVecchi0> @talon824 thanks, i doub i will ever reach level 45 so fast by playing 8 games at night if I'm lucky
[2022-12-11 01:30:48] <goonie1401> Hi flats hope you're doing well :)
[2022-12-11 01:30:50] <%Tazikol> @Tazikol they are still people no need to be disrespectful and rude
[2022-12-11 01:30:52] <pikari__> so from what im hearing is she got buffed

[2022-12-11 01:30:59] <talon824> Sojourn is ridiculous in so many ways. For instance, if you are in a 1v1 with her as a 200hp hero, she just needs 30 rail charge to kill you with a headshot.
[2022-12-11 01:31:06] <$OkamiChanSenpai> I'm ngl 6 ads is a bit freaking extreme woopsCringe woopsCringe woopsCringe
[2022-12-11 01:31:08] <ShowerBastard> worst part is you cant even just play casual gamesmodes and arcade because even in FFA and No Limits etc, its all hog

[2022-12-11 02:31:25] <jordan4847A> @oharock widow, hazno, soujorn, hell even kiriko all use that factor and i think theyre fun to play around, but i also dont see the point in a hook that doesnt one shot
[2022-12-11 02:31:27] <%$TeaHauss> NOTED cheese
[2022-12-11 02:31:29] <%Tunt_Life> i think i still have a clean record in chat
[2022-12-11 02:31:37] <%mchsraider> cleanse is so not fun
[2022-12-11 02:31:50] <@%AwCrap> Somehow Tunt does in fact have a clean record
[2022-12-11 02:31:53] <Richie364> @DragonShinobi i guess in low elo if u cant rely on supports soldier is nice
[2022-12-11 02:31:57] <jordan4847A> @oharock its a good skillshot, weve had 6 years of practice
[2022-12-11 02:32:02] <%$TeaHauss> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 02:32:02] <oharock> @jordan4847A the difference is that they need to hit headshots, and they have low hp
[2022-12-11 02:32:11] <@%AwCrap> Clearly the most wholesome one
[2022-12-11 02:32:11] <%mchsraider> I watched a frozen Orisa stand up and walk out of the freeze
