[2022-12-09 16:28:56] <%+Falkentavio> oh yeah, since spawncamping and driving out is kind of meta in some ranks, it should count as a loss, not a leave. I can anchor and get sunk as well for easy loose rep, driving out is not faster.
[2022-12-09 16:28:57] <@%MsThorns> Death Stranding is fucking weird.

[2022-12-09 16:40:07] <%+Shayru_ALG> patch notes Beard - Following player feedback and internal review, the amount of Allegiance required to progress beyond level 100 with the Guardians of Fortune and Servants of the Flame has been increased.  Our intention with the level 1000 rewards was to create a long-term reward for skilled players to strive towards, and recent changes made will help boost that challenge and make the accomplishment truly reflective of players’ efforts in the Battle for the Sea of Thieves.

[2022-12-09 16:41:59] <FearlessJake> You should be able to sell the flags the same way as athena in each outpost. Which i personally consider a bug.

[2022-12-09 16:44:26] <%RockinPodunk> @Mentozz it took me a sec to find it, but this is on the SoT website support page, posted last week: "Our skill-based matchmaking is based on a system that monitors the outcome of a battle and then adjusts the ranking of the crew accordingly. So if you win a battle, your matchmaking ranking will rise. Though if you lose, it will fall."
[2022-12-09 16:44:30] <%TheMinishLink> Omg its Josh!

[2022-12-09 17:59:55] <+cmdrdean> once your in a fight your in it, the only way out is to win or lose
[2022-12-09 17:59:56] <%+Metz____> Vanilla Crown Royal is a year-round product and it's also very good.  That that Salted Carmel is amazing!
[2022-12-09 18:00:03] <Mylykky> most of the rums taste like bad moonshine

[2022-12-09 18:00:07] <$BeardyNyps> Monkey shoulder is like a bourbon
[2022-12-09 18:00:09] <WeaponizedKarma> Kraken has a coffee flavor that drinks well by itself.
[2022-12-09 18:00:13] <%+XXShadowSaix> I don't know if you have it where you are what about Bundaberg Rum

[2022-12-09 18:01:31] <+Adamantium13> Mix them all together and have a long island iced tea. Delicious!
[2022-12-09 18:01:34] <WeaponizedKarma> I'll drink dark rum straight. not white or clear rums
[2022-12-09 18:01:37] <%JinxedCosplay> I'm the kind of weirdo who shots tequila for fun

[2022-12-09 18:01:59] <+hiddensquid2525> different gins can make it pretty good on its own
[2022-12-09 18:01:59] <%+DoobyUK> you know Gin and Tonic came about as a way to make Tonic drinkable (it was a malaria treatment)
[2022-12-09 18:02:01] <%Renegade__Mr> @The_Great_Rafiki yeh its odd how they exactly the same, 1 just has juniper
[2022-12-09 18:02:02] <%Kato_Kiyomasa> If you’re going to do shots imo it’s purpose is to just get drunk so you may as well down the cheapest crap you can.
[2022-12-09 18:02:03] <%+Sandrafufufu> I love Tequila rose legcGgz
