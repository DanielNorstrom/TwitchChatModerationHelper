[2023-01-04 15:41:32] <%Sprinklethelichking> maybe its slower then vampire survior and doesn't have as satisying sounds and what not
[2023-01-04 15:41:35] <%Tzsen> it's a lot more of an optimisation and numbers game than the others, so you need to want that
[2023-01-04 15:41:52] <+Nyxceris> im not super into it either and for me it's because all the weapons are quite similar at the end of the day. They slice or they shoot. Whereas like, VS, the differences between the weapon effects are wild
