At that point why even use the pad? just use a controller, its exactly the same level as playing ddr. either do it correctly or dont do it. otherwise you are just saying " i managed to trigger all the arrows, so i played ddr right?" do you wanna play ddr? or just trigger the arrows? they arent the same damn thing.

[2022-12-28 02:24:59] <@%ThorW> For very free variety in moves, just style swordmaster and use some circle button presses
[2022-12-28 02:24:59] <%Strayx> I mean you can do the same on Nero
[2022-12-28 02:25:03] <sleepydantezzz> tho it does depend on what you doing for style tho
[2022-12-28 02:25:04] <%Deevohh> i hate playing nero because of that sole reason
[2022-12-28 02:25:09] <%Strayx> YOu were just focused on playing Nero well
[2022-12-28 02:25:11] <%CanonFang_> i think nero is the hardest character since you have to play a rhythm game with him

Unholy vespers & spellbinder, Thunder loop & duplicator, Gorgeous moon, candelabrador and empty tome. The cooldowns are so short, and the effects are so long, that they basically never end, and with the very large area, I can pretty much chill and let death kill me.

THATS NOT PLAYING VAMPIRE SURVIVORS. standing in a corner and not moving your character is not playing god damn VS. At that point why run the game? just watch a video, its exactly the same level as playing vs. either do it correctly or dont do it. otherwise you are just saying " i managed to kill all the enemies, so i played VS right?" do you wanna play VS? or just kill death? they arent the same damn thing.

[2022-12-28 20:50:28] <MeasuringEight> I saw exactly 1.09441 square inches of a girls shoulder today, I immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending, earth shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen EVERYONE in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever had, or ever will produce shot out SO HARD that my dick was ripped apart by my √úbernut, accelerating to 5% of the speed of light by the time it left my urethra.

[2022-12-28 21:25:09] <@%Draconyite> reason people use both rings+arrows is arrows give you the cape capping dmg done to you, and rings for lancet which halves enemy hp. Reaper hp is based on your lvl or w/e so lancet cuts the time down to a manageable limit
[2022-12-28 21:25:11] <%icid> killing reaper counts as at least a 31min run, was changed because of these missions
