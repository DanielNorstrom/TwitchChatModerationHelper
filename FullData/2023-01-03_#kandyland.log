[2023-01-03 10:44:02] <+Brian_Mac_Kilpatrick_> @Kandyland If an elevator starts to fall, there are brakes that activate.
[2023-01-03 10:44:11] <bobsapp2> Most of the girls who approach me is because they wanted to trade up from their current bf. Its a valid strategy
[2023-01-03 10:44:31] <mobagod333> @Brian_Mac_Kilpatrick_ mechanical brakes?
[2023-01-03 10:44:50] <pacman_Bot> I haven't met any human in any country who jumped in elevators, unless maybe 10 yrs old
