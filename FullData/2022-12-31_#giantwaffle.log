[2022-12-31 19:08:20] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-31 19:08:20] <%rickthe_punk> a good coffee machine is like 1k and over

[2022-12-31 20:08:45] <+vapo213> at this point a prebuild vom Domions or Wendys would be a massiv upgrade KEK

[2022-12-31 20:38:24] <dylan0806> Waffle is like Linus making ram
[2022-12-31 20:38:25] <ItsTommySon> download it
[2022-12-31 20:38:26] <RetreatingHairline> Is that what people mean when they say download more ram.
[2022-12-31 20:38:29] <+WhoAmIErik> @Waffle4Goodness yes, id recommend it. Otherwise any of the ATM packs
[2022-12-31 20:38:38] <Waffle4Goodness> okay cool thanks
[2022-12-31 20:38:40] <+stickman_02> His ram is already incompatible

[2022-12-31 20:39:04] <%+Purecrew> why havent you guys made a big clean room lol
[2022-12-31 20:39:10] <+stormblaz> Do you all think well get a new version of USB port soon
[2022-12-31 20:39:14] <Kascade418> Do what that one guy did, mount google drive as swap space
[2022-12-31 20:39:21] <FinnYellowbelly> protip: install another cpu under the motherboard, the case acts as a heatsink 2x the power!
[2022-12-31 20:39:23] <dylan0806> And then pati realize he doesn’t have Xmp enabled
[2022-12-31 20:39:23] <%+theRealWesty84> To realistically complete the pack how many 24hr streams would you have needed to do?
[2022-12-31 20:39:29] <+stormblaz> will usb be replaced by type C cables?

[2022-12-31 20:40:12] <SheepsAholy> you also have usb 3.1
[2022-12-31 20:40:21] <+stormblaz> USB C isnt it a lot faster
[2022-12-31 20:40:22] <%Dagmoo> @theRealWesty84 the group on the sub server has 4 people instead of 2 and has played more than twice as many hours as waffle and they arent done yet
[2022-12-31 20:40:29] <+slayerman_x> nothing like having 10 usb-c to usb-a dongles in order to use your mouse and keyboard
[2022-12-31 20:40:37] <+stickman_02> I need like 12 usb ports on my pc atm I have so many cables
[2022-12-31 20:40:49] <Wazepas> aka the "universal" part of USB pepeLaugh
[2022-12-31 20:40:51] <+stormblaz> are you happy Apple was forced by EU to fully be usb c?
[2022-12-31 20:40:56] <+Spiderti> The U is for Universal
[2022-12-31 20:40:59] <+Gamernxc> isn’t there different types of usb-c
[2022-12-31 20:41:05] <+stormblaz> mini hdmi
[2022-12-31 20:41:10] <+ItsSABER_> Yeah smaller, reversible, higher throughput
[2022-12-31 20:41:12] <+Face_32> is USB-C future proof? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-31 20:41:14] <+stormblaz> can usb c transfer sound and video?
[2022-12-31 20:41:15] <%Dizz1227> @stormblaz Bold of you to assume Apple wont just go full wireless charging
[2022-12-31 20:41:15] <axeraider15> C as a connector is fine.. but as a 'speed' the version can still vary
[2022-12-31 20:41:15] <InternetPlumber> always trust the printer people to fuck up a standard
[2022-12-31 20:41:19] <+Spiderti> The weird type for printers damn you
[2022-12-31 20:41:29] <%cheppard> type b?
[2022-12-31 20:41:30] <+stormblaz> But can USB C be the same as HDMI?

[2022-12-31 20:53:10] <+stormblaz> what mobo?
[2022-12-31 20:53:15] <calebhub514> man I remember when 32 gigs of DDR4 would be like 400 dollars, bad times those were
[2022-12-31 20:53:15] <BuLLeT_LV> 32 for 80 is decent :D
[2022-12-31 20:53:17] <$ShadowBlade72> It's a decent build honestly. It'll serve him well for the price.
[2022-12-31 20:53:26] <%mechoriet> can the mobo hold 2 nvme's tho?
[2022-12-31 20:53:30] <SheepsAholy> does he have 2 nvme slots?

[2022-12-31 20:53:50] <+flagnarok> last longer

[2022-12-31 20:53:56] <+Shadowmail> Heat Sink no included. Hmmmmm
[2022-12-31 20:53:56] <RefiixGaming> 13600k is super good
[2022-12-31 20:53:59] <SeriousPotatoBot> widePepeLaugh I remember paying £80 for a single 8GB 2400mhz ddr4 dim back in 2017
[2022-12-31 20:54:01] <ryanstringer1> 170 for the case should look at 1st player sp9 its a clean case
[2022-12-31 20:54:04] <UZMeNow> @Giantwaffle Check the cooler
[2022-12-31 20:54:04] <Skorpio1> depends on the use case, 13600k is slightly better
[2022-12-31 20:54:08] <+Zyie> I think going for an AMD 5800X3D with AMD mobo is better, especially if he's going to keep it for 10+ years like current one. It's also better for gaming than that CPU.
[2022-12-31 20:54:08] <+Shank_nasty> Problem is with 13 gen you want to change motherboard
[2022-12-31 20:54:09] <%+daedmissica0> this does
[2022-12-31 20:54:10] <+stormblaz> is he using his old cooler
[2022-12-31 20:54:10] <+Sentinel1_9> @giantwaffle rhe e is rhe overclocking one since has a k cpu might as well
[2022-12-31 20:54:17] <sneakyHoovy> Box YEP cooler
[2022-12-31 20:54:17] <%+daedmissica0> you can with this
[2022-12-31 20:54:22] <+stormblaz> you dont need K
[2022-12-31 20:54:23] <RefiixGaming> yes
[2022-12-31 20:54:24] <+flagnarok> 13600k is nicer but you aren't getting the reliability or affordability
[2022-12-31 20:54:24] <Skorpio1> same price I think
[2022-12-31 20:54:25] <sheepiez> Lian Li case is better than an NZXT
[2022-12-31 20:54:25] <+stormblaz> if u dont ovrrclock
[2022-12-31 20:54:29] <%cheppard> does he have a cooler?
[2022-12-31 20:54:30] <dylan0806> Or if you need additional hardware KEKW
[2022-12-31 20:54:33] <+stormblaz> ohhh ks yea
[2022-12-31 20:54:34] <RefiixGaming> If its retail price
[2022-12-31 20:54:35] <RoninStorm> passmark benchmark it
[2022-12-31 20:54:35] <$Stillglade> it would be same basic cost to go to 13600 but then you can get the ddr5 version of the mobo
[2022-12-31 20:54:37] <RefiixGaming> than fs
[2022-12-31 20:54:37] <+AyayaPRlME> does he have cooler?
[2022-12-31 20:54:38] <%Trollsamaa> PCPP isnt perfect but it does help a lot....
[2022-12-31 20:54:41] <+Zyie> K = overclockable, don't need it
[2022-12-31 20:54:42] <+stormblaz> yea if u dont overclock u dont need it
[2022-12-31 20:54:44] <MrWarsai> 13600k is like $30-50 more
[2022-12-31 20:54:49] <%Winstonrocks> why not get the ddr5 version motherboard
[2022-12-31 20:54:49] <+Shank_nasty> K is unlocked, ks is binned
[2022-12-31 20:54:51] <%+wonly> does the 3080 fit in a mid tower case?
[2022-12-31 20:54:54] <CoolReal> K also have higher clocks
[2022-12-31 20:54:55] <%iliketrains0605> K is overclock F is no graphics
[2022-12-31 20:54:56] <%+theflyingamerican74> KEKW
[2022-12-31 20:54:57] <%mechoriet> k = unlocked ks = factory overclocked or something
[2022-12-31 20:55:01] <+flagnarok> 12k is much more reliable and will last way longer than 13k because you'll end up abusing the overclock
[2022-12-31 20:55:09] <CoolReal> Need a cooler
[2022-12-31 20:55:09] <$Stillglade> K allows overclock, F has no Graphics
[2022-12-31 20:55:09] <kaggez> K is over clok enablet. KS is binned
[2022-12-31 20:55:09] <%Winstonrocks> its the same price

[2022-12-31 20:55:53] <+Thr0h> H115i
[2022-12-31 20:55:56] <+Zyie> I would go for a Noctua DH-15, just as effective in cooling, but cheaper

[2022-12-31 20:56:18] <%mechoriet> I mean the watercoolers are all the same just the shroud is different
[2022-12-31 20:56:18] <ryanstringer1> i built my pc for £1200 and if he goes for a cheaper case he could bump up something else
[2022-12-31 20:56:18] <+Dynamic1237> I don't really like the CM liquid cooler, it doesn't have RGB controller, it is a physical button (At least some of them do)
[2022-12-31 20:56:19] <+AyayaPRlME> Be quiet, Arctic and corsair are probably best

[2022-12-31 20:57:35] <$ShadowBlade72> Surprisingly I dropped ~5 degrees switching from an AIO to the NH-D15.  Nothing major, but also no risk of the pump running dry or leaking.

[2022-12-31 21:24:51] <%DrHax_> Are the drones high enough in the air so their rotor noises arent annoying as fuck?
[2022-12-31 21:24:53] <+DERFI3000> have you tried the pico 4?
[2022-12-31 21:25:04] <%GeekJenn> I’ve never had motion sickness except playing VR

[2022-12-31 21:25:29] <iloveplants> easy solution, add in a process to stabilize before you push it to the headset
[2022-12-31 21:25:29] <%GeekJenn> Yeah it was playing a FPS
[2022-12-31 21:25:29] <%CJS7070> VR legs yeah

[2022-12-31 21:26:18] <ffstyke> have u tried NMS VR?
[2022-12-31 21:26:19] <$ShadowBlade72> I've got my VR legs as well, but I appreciated that VRC added the tunnel vision mode to help new people.

[2022-12-31 21:26:26] <%CJS7070> If SteamVR crashes and I'm still moving but the display is frozen that fucks me up
[2022-12-31 21:26:26] <+ZyrnUwU> Playing VR actually made it easier to ride rollercoasters IRL for me

[2022-12-31 21:26:50] <%+timbit123> the worst ls when you move your head but headset doesn't follow
[2022-12-31 21:26:50] <%Arimil> I like head bobbing KEKW
[2022-12-31 21:27:05] <%Arimil> It feels weird to me with it off, feels like I'm ice skating everywhere.
[2022-12-31 21:27:10] <$ShadowBlade72> Yeah, it blurs your peripheral vision when you move in VRC to help you focus and try to prevent motion sickness.
[2022-12-31 21:27:16] <%+619srt> LUL
[2022-12-31 21:27:27] <%DrHax_> I couldnt watch i.e. God of War streams because of the mild bobbing, its already too much for me DansGame

[2022-12-31 21:27:34] <%TimmyVRC> Waffle try continuous walking where you walk straight in VR but you're walking circles in your play space. That was the most sick I've ever gotten in VR

[2022-12-31 23:39:29] <Kondarx> can also use atlauncher if you dont like curseforge
[2022-12-31 23:39:37] <DaddyDiddy> when i get creative tank i tore down 95% of my base because I no longer needed all the long lines of chem reactors and stuff @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-31 23:39:40] <+Sentinel1_9> nither does ci
[2022-12-31 23:39:41] <$Stillglade> you might need to go find that computercraft program you wrote a few years ago for creative tank liquid swapping
[2022-12-31 23:39:47] <%Dagmoo> if you dont look what Ci is doing then you cant be disappointed
[2022-12-31 23:40:02] <%DaemonSzyman> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-31 23:40:05] <kane1941> you have EV line?
[2022-12-31 23:40:16] <%+619srt> will that mod pack with the gamepass version of mc? Anybody know?
[2022-12-31 23:40:19] <%Winstonrocks> down stairs in the corner
[2022-12-31 23:40:26] <$ShadowBlade72> I thought it was in the clean room at one point, but I can't remember.
[2022-12-31 23:40:31] <+CommanderUrsus> what was on the other side of the clean room?
[2022-12-31 23:40:34] <%LurkerNr5> it might be on hv wire put down instead of another machine
[2022-12-31 23:40:37] <%maccabeus> @619srt it's a java modpack, gamepass is probably bedrock

[2022-12-31 23:40:54] <%Winstonrocks> along the wall of unautomated machines?
[2022-12-31 23:40:58] <%LurkerNr5> in a corner maybe
[2022-12-31 23:40:59] <DaddyDiddy> yes
[2022-12-31 23:41:03] <DaddyDiddy> you can't just put IV into it
[2022-12-31 23:41:03] <B0atyMcBoatface> cant you just use the interface thingy? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-31 23:41:04] <kane1941> why would it, it can accept up to EV
[2022-12-31 23:41:06] <%+619srt> @619srt its both? So that mean it will work PauseChamp
[2022-12-31 23:41:18] <DaddyDiddy> you can put up to EV into it but not higher,
[2022-12-31 23:41:18] <+CommanderUrsus> huh
[2022-12-31 23:41:22] <%LurkerNr5> I think you might have placed it instead of a chemical machine
[2022-12-31 23:41:22] <+mytz3> @619srt Yeah just sign in with your microsoft account in the launcher
[2022-12-31 23:41:38] <DaddyDiddy> hover over it and hit "Y" it should do the find thingy like T does for items @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-31 23:41:38] <%+619srt> thanks dooders
[2022-12-31 23:41:45] <%Dagmoo> i could be wrong but i dont think you made assembler
[2022-12-31 23:41:49] <%Dagmoo> 3
[2022-12-31 23:42:02] <+Zyie> @619srt Yeah, you get access to both versions of MC through game pass, so you can play the modpack if you want through that.
[2022-12-31 23:42:03] <kane1941> what you needed it for?
[2022-12-31 23:42:04] <%Dagmoo> i think you made assembler 2
[2022-12-31 23:42:05] <CoolReal> @619srt You will need to use the java version but login with the microsoft account
[2022-12-31 23:42:07] <Niceyyy> you have not made it mate
[2022-12-31 23:42:24] <%+619srt> this probably not the modpack to start your first time in minecraft correct?
[2022-12-31 23:42:32] <CoolReal> 100% not
[2022-12-31 23:42:41] <Niceyyy> dang xD
[2022-12-31 23:42:42] <DaddyDiddy> do not play gregtech for your introduction into modded, not a great idea @619srt
[2022-12-31 23:42:47] <+BobTaco21> @619srt Yeah no
[2022-12-31 23:42:50] <+FowD8> i think in community edition it won't blow up, the cable will just burn up (unless you don't use a cable and put it right next to it) @Giantwaffle

[2022-12-31 23:42:53] <CoolReal> It's his first introduction to the game LULW
[2022-12-31 23:42:55] <%+619srt> Sadge
[2022-12-31 23:42:56] <Niceyyy> xD
[2022-12-31 23:43:15] <DaddyDiddy> play like stoneblock or sky factory
[2022-12-31 23:43:15] <SheepsAholy> thats a great idea actually
[2022-12-31 23:43:15] <JBrown> yeah start with Nascar KKona
[2022-12-31 23:43:18] <%maccabeus> FTB University, Skyblock, and Enigmatica are all more appropriate starter packs imo
[2022-12-31 23:43:18] <%Dagmoo> @619srt yeah everyone has been suggesting FTB Academy for first time modded
[2022-12-31 23:43:19] <%+619srt> looks like soo much fun
[2022-12-31 23:43:28] <+CommanderUrsus> I mean you should at least beat vanilla first
[2022-12-31 23:43:33] <DaddyDiddy> i mean you can give it a go but you're not going to have a fun time @619srt
[2022-12-31 23:43:34] <%+619srt> NOTED will look into that.
[2022-12-31 23:43:36] <CoolReal> I'd say playing vanilla for a bit would be better LULW
[2022-12-31 23:43:45] <kane1941> are SMDs automated?
[2022-12-31 23:43:55] <%+619srt> Vanilla looks boring af to me

[2022-12-31 23:44:39] <Bulltank> I dont play vanilla minecraft at all
[2022-12-31 23:44:43] <SheepsAholy> I never played vanilla Mc, Gregtech was my first
[2022-12-31 23:44:49] <%DiStegro> That's me, one day I'll touch vanilla
[2022-12-31 23:44:50] <DaddyDiddy> vanilla minecraft has made a lot of improvements over the years but its no where as fun as modded
[2022-12-31 23:44:55] VIEWERS: 2 162
[2022-12-31 23:45:01] <+BobTaco21> Vanilla is fun every now and again when I want to make mega builds but now modded is my go to
[2022-12-31 23:45:07] <+iDiezALot> I did like 2 hours of vanilla, graduated to skyblock and from then on pretty much only Modded
[2022-12-31 23:45:08] <Bulltank> The problem with not knowing vanilla is all the tricks from vanilla
[2022-12-31 23:45:24] <+Zyie> I've never played fully vanilla MC, always played either modpacks, or "vanilla" with a number of mods I added myself
[2022-12-31 23:45:25] <gikei> figuring out automation in vanilla is fun imo
[2022-12-31 23:45:30] <+suicidebolt> I just bought and went head long into this mod as the first Minecraft I have ever done and it has been fun so far
[2022-12-31 23:45:32] <Ratlanta> with one tank you can make infinite tanks
[2022-12-31 23:45:34] <DaddyDiddy> nah you get infinite creative quantum tanks
[2022-12-31 23:45:40] <Ratlanta> you'll have a tank for every fluid
[2022-12-31 23:46:03] <DaddyDiddy> the creative tank data is made from the heart of the universe
[2022-12-31 23:46:13] <kane1941> its a mold that doesnt get consumed

[2022-12-31 23:46:44] <LethalBro> NC = not consumed in the recipe

[2022-12-31 23:47:51] <DaddyDiddy> you get to UHV circuits before you even get to the tier 10 micro miner so you'll make all the circuits and what not

[2022-12-31 23:50:52] <DaddyDiddy> you only need PBI for like all the asslines recipes and advanced SMD capacitors and what not so you're gonna need a super tank full at least
