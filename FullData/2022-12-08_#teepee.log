[2022-12-08 15:09:04] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP has always played Warzone on PC. Typically he plays with a controller, but switches to MKB often to keep the game feeling new. He made the switch to PC for better frames and better FOV | - !ibp | - !specs | for more info | #sponsored |

[2022-12-08 15:41:09] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-08 16:05:55] <%dawightloadz> the key is not to be a “sentinel” 😂
[2022-12-08 16:05:56] <%+Vinman1006> more people can run a marathon than win 5 Warzone games in a row LOL
[2022-12-08 16:05:56] <%+tatergrater6> it helps when you are playing with the talent on your team (minus maven). I'd like to see you try and when with my boys lol

[2022-12-08 16:06:22] <$Original_spooon> I could definitely train for a marathon in shorter time than getting good enough to win 5 Warzone games in a row

[2022-12-08 16:06:40] <reigntheft> if you think about a marathon lasts a long time and with this grind for a nuke in warzone lasts a long time also so i agree with him @teepee
[2022-12-08 16:06:41] <%+speckto3> Just rat center circle and kill the last squad or two

[2022-12-08 16:08:08] <+WINK_Gaming04> What does the nuke challenge entail ?
[2022-12-08 16:08:08] <%STRINGER____> Better marathon comparison: Anyone can run one. Not very many people can get it  done in under 3 hours
[2022-12-08 16:08:11] <%abramsmech1789> if you have a group of people who are good shooters and know what they are doing, getting wins is totally doable
[2022-12-08 16:08:11] <%+cogs26> @teepee then it would be a marathon - the hard part is putting together 26 individual miles - not hard to run 1 but when you put a string together like that (similar to winning 5) it’s exponentially harder

[2022-12-08 16:09:59] <%+AndrewReise> @WINK_Gaming04 5 wins in a row, then in the next game a special contract appears on the map. you have to grab radioactive elements. the first puts crown on your head that everyone sees. the second does damage to you every 2 seconds. the third scrambles your map. and then you have to use them to arm the nuke. once armed, everyone sees the site and is notified they have to stop you or they lose the game

[2022-12-08 16:15:07] <@%OpTicJadson> @m1ndful1games technically yes only because someone can pick them up and sabotage

[2022-12-08 17:24:30] <@%^Streamlabs> Teep has not switched his input, he plays both KBM and controller. Typically he switches when it gets stale. His movement feels better on controller, but his shot feels better on mouse. He’s roughly a 70% - 30% split favoring controller. To tell what he is using, look under his spare plates, if "Y" (controller) if 4 (KBM). teepMnk

Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-08 18:19:28] <%PaintSplats> I think Blackout woulda stuck around longer if it wasnt pay to play
[2022-12-08 18:19:28] <%+bwildcat96> it was good because they nailed all aspects of it

[2022-12-08 18:19:34] <%+coachbone10> @Sirupywarrior not currently, win streak is a 0
[2022-12-08 18:19:42] <Kranjos> Remember when we had stats for each mode in the Blackout Beta. Yet 3 years after Warzone has been a thing, we still don't have it (and no stats for Warzone 2 period)
[2022-12-08 18:19:42] <%antwan_barca> No buybacks on Blackout was bad though.
[2022-12-08 18:19:47] <@%kyote7667> Blackout was a shit show at the start
[2022-12-08 18:19:47] <%+gimme_dat_> Would love blackout with a gulag and buy back system

[2022-12-08 18:19:48] <+RuggedxGhost> because it was free
[2022-12-08 18:19:48] <%+Brochacho37> cuz it was free to play
[2022-12-08 18:19:50] <%randosia> So was the win streak yesterday a record?
[2022-12-08 18:19:51] <%+crimsonbls> probably because it was free lol
[2022-12-08 18:19:53] <%DBLAIS31> Because no one had to pay for Warzone...

[2022-12-08 18:19:58] <%irie_society> If it was free to play it would be different

[2022-12-08 18:20:04] <jimiwins> H1z1 and blackout died for our BRs today
[2022-12-08 18:20:05] <+paresh01> Do you mute with your roller?
[2022-12-08 18:20:06] <%+dotatron11> what part of the US has the sweatiest servers do you think
[2022-12-08 18:20:06] <$Hoerzy10> If blackout was free, it would have taken off
[2022-12-08 18:20:08] <%+SirThicccolas> Warzone was cross play though. Blackout wasn’t cross plat so it lost the player base
[2022-12-08 18:20:09] <noodlepuffed> If Blackout was free to play and cross console.
[2022-12-08 18:20:09] <%+NaClControl> covid too
[2022-12-08 18:20:11] <%+cyounger11g> free to play plus during a global pandemic lol
[2022-12-08 18:20:12] <%Jasetheace2> It's a shame Blackout wasn't released at the start of the pandemic and f2p, would have been a bit of a different story

[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <%hammy_man_> @AdultNinja Yeah I have been doing that. Got gold pistols and RPK but that is about it. Most of my AR's are close.
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <%$mriener12> The answer is the pandemic
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <jmoose22> It also helped there were locked downs and everyone had nothing to do lol
[2022-12-08 18:20:15] <+Maniacdpm> covid
[2022-12-08 18:20:16] <GRXKX7X> It was Because if Ccovid
[2022-12-08 18:20:17] <%+The_Rosko> Covid def accelerated its popularity
[2022-12-08 18:20:18] <dmcdougal> pandemic timing helped WZ too I think
[2022-12-08 18:20:18] <+LittleNicky17> Didn't cross play come out for WZ1 too?
[2022-12-08 18:20:22] <%+tylerdurdin1> Cross play and F2P
[2022-12-08 18:20:22] <%jcdaddy925> Naw I love it no backs made the win much better when you clutched with just two on the squad
[2022-12-08 18:20:22] <+DarthLee77> Timing for WZ1 was amazing with the lockdown for Covid
[2022-12-08 18:20:22] <%+mahnster406> WZ1 was FTP and cross platform!
[2022-12-08 18:20:22] <%DVS27t> blackout wasn't cross platform either
[2022-12-08 18:20:23] <+jmars2814> Cross play makes a big difference
[2022-12-08 18:20:24] <GRXKX7X> Covidf
[2022-12-08 18:20:25] <%+k100danny> I’m glad they don’t have grapples in this game
[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <@%kyote7667> No cross play didn’t help
[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <+VibrantTV_> yes
[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <opexcuseme> yup
[2022-12-08 18:20:28] <%nauticaln8y> Yep
[2022-12-08 18:20:28] <+scoobs2020> and it came out for lockdown
[2022-12-08 18:20:28] <%+tritttycent> yes just got pop up
[2022-12-08 18:20:29] <%+motor_2> not sure

[2022-12-08 18:20:31] <mikey_2291> Competitive blackout was the goat though
[2022-12-08 18:20:31] <%cynful3> Yes it is true
[2022-12-08 18:20:33] <+paresh01> Yes

[2022-12-08 18:20:34] <%+JadovskiLB> warzone 2 is free to play? but i guess to level and get the guns
[2022-12-08 18:20:34] <%jcdaddy925> updated last night
[2022-12-08 18:20:34] <%+MiggyMxG> @incognino nope. Hardpoint sitting behind doors and near the point helped. When they see riot shield they don’t know what to do haha
[2022-12-08 18:20:35] <%+shenaenae_laquieffa> YES
[2022-12-08 18:20:35] <%+Brochacho37> yeah, because it was ahead of it's time.... crossplay wasn't really a thing yet
[2022-12-08 18:20:36] <%+coachbone10> @antwan_barca forced you to play your life a little more though, not ego chall for a third-party though
[2022-12-08 18:20:38] <+dudeimgeorge> you are all my dads
[2022-12-08 18:20:38] <+gr8dane92> should help with crashing too
[2022-12-08 18:20:39] <%+flamingobirdo> Yooooooo Teeeeeep, it’s been a while
[2022-12-08 18:20:42] <%+da_benbino> I think the sole reason Warzone got as big as it was, was covid!
[2022-12-08 18:20:43] <+MetaGamess> blackout was also competing with peak fortnite
[2022-12-08 18:20:44] <%$HerdsDaGoon> Last week was the first time I played CoD since Blackout came out. Now Im addicted again
[2022-12-08 18:20:46] <%$samous97> Blackout just needed a buy back system
[2022-12-08 18:20:47] <%Alacardias> @TeePee There is a Hearthstone stream RDU who love to play Warzone but he says he sucks at it. Maybe you could reach out to him and show him the ropes! ;)
[2022-12-08 18:20:50] <%itsPistoIPete> I don't recall a bunch of hackers in blackout either
[2022-12-08 18:20:52] <%incognino> @MiggyMxG yup they lose their minds
[2022-12-08 18:20:52] <%$waxxxman007> doing the dl now
[2022-12-08 18:20:53] <+gr8dane92> they suggested new drivers for less crashing
[2022-12-08 18:20:53] <%TheBoogieMan235> Cross platform, usable pc version, and free to play definitely made warzone 1 more popular
[2022-12-08 18:20:55] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @TeePee dont use yet, initial reviews are not good will keep posted
[2022-12-08 18:20:56] <+dudeimgeorge> @da_benbino 100000%
[2022-12-08 18:20:58] <+MavrixGaming> Just checked your net worth on google and you making some serious Ps! Good work
[2022-12-08 18:20:59] <+VibrantTV_> for portal rtx
[2022-12-08 18:21:00] <IIBASSIl> fingers crossed it helps with crashing
[2022-12-08 18:21:01] <%+FRESH_BUSINESS> I think it being free sucks. If people paid for it, they may take it a little more seriously instead of trolling the whole fucking game.
[2022-12-08 18:21:02] <%hammy_man_> 527.56 is newest... looking for notes

[2022-12-08 18:22:31] <HamNoble> he was comparing blackout and wz1, the former not being free to play
[2022-12-08 18:22:36] <Cockney_womble> The devs have said most of the stability issues people are having is down to not using the latest gpu drivers

[2022-12-08 18:24:11] <+Larokey> looking forward to the inevitable akimbo pistol nerf. just like the last 5 times an akimbo pistol needed a nerf
[2022-12-08 18:24:11] <ttyholub> the AI are gross

[2022-12-08 18:24:30] <+SwaggedWaffle> the amount of time you spend with ground loot isnt long. just buy your gun or get a loadout and get your skin. @malibujp
[2022-12-08 18:24:31] <$ElijahKaty> teep you should try out the elden ring coliseum enbRespect
[2022-12-08 18:24:37] <%+hammertime135> I think WZ was more popular because it had lower TTK, easier looting (no bag), and buybacks. I'd love blackout 2 w/ a buy station. That would be perfect.

[2022-12-08 18:25:24] <MagicaIRadical> @hammertime135 you mean higher ttk?

[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <@%kyote7667> @hammertime135  more popular? More playing this now, and bought the mp than ever ? Or do you mean just bitching?
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <+jahwitdasmoke> They’ll probably nerf the pistols and RPK and that’s it

[2022-12-08 18:27:46] <+dudeimgeorge> they need to raise the ttk in this game
[2022-12-08 18:27:53] <+Larokey> I think the RPK might survive a balance patch, they usually let the OP long range guns stick around for longer. the pistols are insane for not even needing Overkill

[2022-12-08 18:37:17] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-08 18:49:52] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-08 22:53:22] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-08 23:40:57] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info
