[2022-12-07 12:55:22] <%Robinhoodrs07> 3rd person FPS style MOBA just came out on the 1st.
[2022-12-07 12:55:27] <%Arthusii> Terror is a great counter carry in certain situations but can be niche and also 6% of playerbase has enough brain to play him
[2022-12-07 12:56:38] <%Arthusii> Smite was fab but they are killing it for my a bit with the amount of retarded licensed skin deals. It looks like a clown show now...

[2022-12-07 13:01:19] <%Arthusii> It's literally GODS from different pantheons of the world. A clash of gods in an arena. How badass is that you ask? You can test your skills as Hades, Greek god of the underworld against Ra, Egyptian the god of the sun

[2022-12-07 13:04:24] <%Arthusii> I feel like qop got left behind when they reworked midlaners and spellcaster scaling and she is still the old school midlaner where she slaps early/mid game and then falls off a cliff.

[2022-12-07 15:47:53] <%Bushy0> can some explain why they hate the new portal thing? from my understanding of how its worded you only lose home if you leave from portal into a BZ after TPing from an HO

[2022-12-07 15:49:25] <tediitaro> lewpac, what happen if the terri is launched but stay unclaimed after the 30min, will it be open to anyone to claim it?

[2022-12-07 15:55:33] <MrVenum> yea i seen loads of 8 point something guys in there
[2022-12-07 15:56:04] <MrVenum> bloody annoying as can't get any cheats and rarely get a turbulant whisp
[2022-12-07 15:56:14] <MrVenum> is a joke tbh
[2022-12-07 15:56:22] <%Bushy0> ask for us please cause seems like no reason LUL
[2022-12-07 15:56:24] <TheBasicConcept> Is "old patch gear" still relevant in todays patch or does gear get outdated in new, big patch?
[2022-12-07 15:56:29] <%mavenun> that was i was looking for..
[2022-12-07 15:56:43] <%mavenun> 4 hour maintennace and no patch
[2022-12-07 15:56:53] <TheBasicConcept> So, in WoW the gear is irrelevant with new expansions
[2022-12-07 15:56:56] <TheBasicConcept> how is it in albion?
[2022-12-07 15:57:17] <@%+Cleatus_VanDamme> @TheBasicConcept I recommend trashing everything post patch and crafting all new stuff to get correct stats Kappa

[2022-12-07 15:57:31] <MrVenum> so no spiders or rare boss mobs in non lethals ?
[2022-12-07 15:57:31] VIEWERS: 425
[2022-12-07 15:57:32] <%n1vlem> @TheBasicConcept that is not an issue at all
[2022-12-07 15:57:54] <%n1vlem> Also gear isn't really permanent in this game. It's normal to buy new gear 10 times in a day
[2022-12-07 15:58:08] <%Bushy0> @MrVenum you can get the t4 artifacts in YZ mist, i am fairly certain there is no spiders in YZ unless something changed i am unaware of
[2022-12-07 15:58:16] <TheBasicConcept> Awesome!
[2022-12-07 15:58:25] <%PlexasAideron> gear is a consumable in albion
[2022-12-07 15:58:36] <%Bushy0> the turbo juice and chest spawn there tho
[2022-12-07 15:58:59] <%Bushy0> i didnt wanna type it out LUL
