[2022-12-22 11:30:35] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.

[2022-12-22 14:09:10] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.
