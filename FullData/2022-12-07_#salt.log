[2022-12-07 17:40:46] <rawtek91> your own lucky click is about skip animation :D

[2022-12-07 17:42:57] <%+Jamesanna77> I was watching a Pistanity clip when you hit that PEN acc on the skip. EZ mode!
[2022-12-07 17:43:37] <rawtek91> bs control your click when animation is on, thats why i prefer with no animation, so its your perfect tap
