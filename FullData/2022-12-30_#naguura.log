[2022-12-30 14:36:46] <%CeriusTV> @Naguura  There is an overall alpha setting, set this to a lower value, like seethrough. Then the in range settings to higher value. That shoud fix it ^^

[2022-12-30 14:44:14] <Frankpolard> literally every current MMO lets you swap talents / spec / job whenever you want. adding some kind of arbitrary zone where its allowed doesnt make it more difficult, it just wastes time.

[2022-12-30 14:45:04] <bootymcboatface22> like aggro should only be taken away from a tank by a tank.
[2022-12-30 14:45:04] <TranquilizingShot> @cosworth1977 You can't change it in combat, in BG/arena when the battle has started, and not in M+ when the timer is started. It's honestly not as "free" as it may seem. It's just super convenient now

[2022-12-30 14:45:27] <+Galdek> yea spending gold to change talents is super hard!
[2022-12-30 14:45:31] <Jonesy4> I just want to play the game and have fun, I don't want to play 5d chess when it comes to changing talens
[2022-12-30 14:45:36] <lazorbeamz1> Thnx for the clearification. Guess i need to do that during My game later 🤣🤣
[2022-12-30 14:45:42] <cosworth1977> ahhhh
[2022-12-30 14:45:54] <k1wadawg> @Jonesy4 then google "Boomkin m+ talents" and copy, not that deep bro

[2022-12-30 14:47:19] <Jonesy4> yal got me wrong, this sytem is better. i'm saying having some system around an item or a cap to amount of talent changing is the 5d chess lol

[2022-12-30 14:47:22] <Henariii> yeah i think its abit easier
[2022-12-30 14:47:25] <brotdassbernd> if oyu just want to play 1 talent tree, you can....
[2022-12-30 14:47:26] <+Skylli> when you start to swap them frequently. you know you are tweaking this and this.
[2022-12-30 14:47:37] <toretorpedx> Dragonflight is nothing compared to covenants and leggo in Shadowlands.
[2022-12-30 14:47:41] <%Tenivir> I would say the talent tree looks a lot scarier now when you first make an alt, all these new spells and so many talents thrown at you right away
[2022-12-30 14:47:42] <+Skylli> and it goes easier and easier
[2022-12-30 14:47:46] <%Tenivir> kinda need guides for alts

[2022-12-30 14:49:32] <Sasow> :O
[2022-12-30 14:49:45] <+itschloe002> None of it was 5d chess, most of it was all fake choice anyway because it was just black and white which was good and which was bad
[2022-12-30 14:49:49] <%watermel0n92> @Naguura, i think the best way to learn the talent tree is by leveling from zero Nerdge

[2022-12-30 14:51:36] <vitykp> And then there was corruption for a single patch lol

[2022-12-30 14:51:46] <+Skylli> @leetboy23 you are using the condition tab of the WA.
[2022-12-30 14:51:56] <toretorpedx> Does it matter if you buy Bronze, silver or gold Primal Molten Alloy when crafting a weapon?
[2022-12-30 14:52:10] <+cinnamints> @itschloe002 Not necessarily. I've always geared/talented farming toons totally differently than dungeon or raid toons. "Good" was very different depending on intended purpose.
[2022-12-30 14:52:18] <leetboy23> @Skylli yea i actually figured that much out but then couldnt get anywhere from there lmao

[2022-12-30 14:52:50] <+Skylli> @leetboy23 you can create a weak aura from WA template. select what you want to track and at the end WA ask you what kind of behavior you want

[2022-12-30 14:52:55] <%+McShloven> I started out just copying then I started looking into talents.  It's been fun learning all the synergies between everything and it really helps when you know how stuff works together.
[2022-12-30 14:52:58] <cyarinn_> It's not really 5D chess if you can read at an elementary school level. Just read the tooltips. Blizzard has made it easier than ever to be able to play the way you want to play.
[2022-12-30 14:53:03] <+sim967> Don’t even have to do that, can let Blizz select your talents.  Don’t have to interact with the UI at all
[2022-12-30 14:53:03] <droopydorf> Yeah this expansion is still pretty sic so far!
[2022-12-30 14:53:18] <droopydorf> I’m enjoying all that you can do and I don’t feel rushed

[2022-12-30 14:53:58] <%Tenivir> craft orders and profession knowledge etc is the confusing part of the expac

[2022-12-30 14:54:10] <buffkenobi> @Naguura the whole game coming from shadowlands can be overwhelming at first, but with some research and just passively playing, you pick it up

[2022-12-30 14:55:38] <+Skylli> so it feels great but you have to understand that
[2022-12-30 14:55:39] <%Tareah> i feel like i'm behind for sure - because it feels like i need them all to get the option end rewards to be the best .. like the way to upgrade gear item you can get from top renown but that means i have to do all the quests

[2022-12-30 15:27:12] <%+LtJenkins> @NotNamedWell If you want to make armor for yourself then don't worry about cost. They made the crafting gear very good this tier. Like comparable to mythic raiding. But the window to make the best stuff is like right now and crashing fast.

[2022-12-30 15:28:05] <%+LtJenkins> @NotNamedWell So I think it depends on what you want to do. If your goal is to make money, it will take a long time to break even on the initial investment. Throwing mats on the AH is generally worth it for a long time.

[2022-12-30 15:33:06] <%$Stricken79> @Reloe 5k!?!? I'll take one!
[2022-12-30 15:33:07] <perkalerk> i saw lariat recipe already down to 750k on my server
[2022-12-30 15:33:12] <NotNamedWell> @Naguura so i am verry casual warrior, i just go mining/blacksmithing then to get me some crafted items? or 2 gathering prof's to collect money to buy gear?

[2022-12-30 15:33:32] <+dangershot9209> But what is the best way to farm primal chaos then for crafted gear?
[2022-12-30 15:33:38] <@%Kuroz> it's littlewigs
[2022-12-30 15:33:39] <@%Kuroz> not a wa
[2022-12-30 15:33:50] <+Pewpewdeada> Sick, people have been randomly telling me there's a limit of 5 crafted items for some reason
[2022-12-30 15:33:51] <starke02> you also cant convert crafted item into tier piece
[2022-12-30 15:33:54] <%+Naynee> What to craft with your Third spark? Droptimizer in raidbots has a section for Epic Crafted Gear to check what’s best for your character. You can also add an Alchemical Food Pouch as a embellishment that doesn’t take up a slot for a food buff that persists through death.

[2022-12-30 15:33:59] <%AJzz> food buffone doesnt count
[2022-12-30 15:34:01] <%+LtJenkins> @Naguura I think you missed part of the discussion. The question asked was what professions should someone do if they were looking to make money. I agree the crafted gear is very good but probably too late to get started if the goal is to make money with crafted gear.
[2022-12-30 15:34:08] <Back_To_Styx> funny thing is that the food one doesnt count for the 2
[2022-12-30 15:34:18] <%+toonz2380> the food one doesent count as embelishment? i heard somthing like that.
[2022-12-30 15:34:22] <+Moophus> 3?
[2022-12-30 15:34:25] <+mario_kart6> You can have the food buff embellishment on the ring, it doesn't count towards the 2 embellishments @Naguura
[2022-12-30 15:34:26] <Back_To_Styx> y it doesnt count
[2022-12-30 15:34:28] <+Moophus> I thought it was 2 :o
[2022-12-30 15:34:35] <+Pewpewdeada> Yeah so at some point down the line with more sparks we can pretty much just fully craft gear an alt
[2022-12-30 15:34:37] <NotNamedWell> @LtJenkins well actually what is best for me to get as a casual in progression for my character :D
[2022-12-30 15:34:37] <+Moophus> I have to catch up clearly missed 1

[2022-12-30 15:35:24] <+Xulu_> Do they still recommend you have 3 diff stat gems in your lariat or is that no longer a thing? Looking at my last raid logs the buffs never overlapped, so it didn't seem worth it.

[2022-12-30 15:35:41] <%Reloe> the thing with professions is that you have an entry cost before you can even start making a profit
[2022-12-30 15:36:05] <+Caz1_> Maybe they will add more embellishments later on
[2022-12-30 15:36:18] <Livsie> Do you think when a new tier comes out it will cost sparks to upgrade the gear past 418?
[2022-12-30 15:36:18] <%Diogle> how are you supposed to get your crafting skill up in future patches for further upgrades?
[2022-12-30 15:36:21] <ghamrawy123> Is the expansion out yet?

[2022-12-30 15:36:27] <perkalerk> the one thing i don't like about gathering profs is how much money you make is tied to finding the titan touched nodes...usually 50% of the money i get is from awakened orders
[2022-12-30 15:36:34] <%+WeaselMuffin> pretty sure i applied to this group too and im quite glad they declined me

[2022-12-30 15:46:36] <FluffyDooom> At least on our server, it's just a big price for the craft, then they re-craft for free until rank 5 (for lariat)

[2022-12-30 15:46:42] <Livsie> Part of why the prices are so high is probably because we're paying for "finding" a crafter. I imagine in a few months all crafting will be done through a crafting discord or something
[2022-12-30 15:46:45] <%Limdaer> @Naguura I dont get that either, because they can money from resourcefulness procs

[2022-12-30 15:47:07] <Thalittleboy> aint nobody working for free
[2022-12-30 15:47:08] <+Kogg> it costs 5 mettle every recraft
[2022-12-30 15:47:09] <+Shrugal> But if you don't the RNG is on the crafter, not on you
[2022-12-30 15:47:10] <%+LtJenkins> @FluffyDooom That's what the person did for me for my neck. Guarantee rank 4, but then said they would refract for free until rank 5
[2022-12-30 15:47:10] <%Limdaer> You need their mats
[2022-12-30 15:47:12] <nomondeath> do not have to send it back
[2022-12-30 15:47:17] <nomondeath> he can chose to recraft
[2022-12-30 15:47:17] <%Reloe> if you want to provide the materials I need to send it back for each recraft

[2022-12-30 15:47:38] <BLACKFOOT_TN> I wish someone whose a Plater god would do a YT video explaining everything in a "For Dummy's" level.
[2022-12-30 15:47:39] <%Thac0iswhac0> I had a crafter charge 5k, then every one after they asked for 1sp until they hit 5 for me :)  that's somebody that will get my business again
[2022-12-30 15:47:45] <%Limdaer> Yeah that is what he means by "sending back"
[2022-12-30 15:47:47] <@%Kuroz> @mataou1450 it's sub only on discord
[2022-12-30 15:47:51] <%Reloe> I can recraft myself until it procs to 5 before I complete the order
[2022-12-30 15:47:55] <+Banjo586> the crafter can choose to recraft with their mats
[2022-12-30 15:47:56] <%Reloe> it just starts using my own mats then
[2022-12-30 15:47:57] <+Kogg> we can keep recrafting
[2022-12-30 15:47:59] <%+Velanthos> you can do either, the crafter can recraft but they use mettle so they typically dont.
[2022-12-30 15:48:00] <+MadBarber44> because the finger with wich he click hursts in time with every recraft VoHiYo
[2022-12-30 15:48:01] <%nevernude1> Why not just get the r5 proc on the first craft?
[2022-12-30 15:48:06] <maldozerr> they have an option to recraft with their own mats before completing order
[2022-12-30 15:48:09] <FluffyDooom> Well, if you just recraft on the initial order, you spend your own metle. So you have to have them re-send to spend their metle
[2022-12-30 15:48:21] <mataou1450> @mataou1450 thanks
[2022-12-30 15:48:26] <%Reloe> they just need to provide a system where the consumer can send a bulk of mats
[2022-12-30 15:48:32] <+ycobra123> they have an option to recraft without sending back, if the crafter recrafts, it spends their own mettle
[2022-12-30 15:48:33] <%Limdaer> I mean.. standing there 10 minutes and recrafting something for free... LUL

[2022-12-30 15:48:44] <soge131> @Naguura , the crafter can choose to not finish the order and keep recrafting it until rank 5 but then you are the one that provides further reagents and mettle
[2022-12-30 15:48:45] <+Banjo586> for bad rng
[2022-12-30 15:48:48] <davy_> I also really want min quality public orders YEP
[2022-12-30 15:48:53] <+Draczyl> I think the crafting system would be better if you could also see people's spec and proc %s as it's a lot of whispers and trust right now
[2022-12-30 15:48:54] <Critzor> is mettle unlimited?
[2022-12-30 15:49:00] <%gerryblue> no crit
[2022-12-30 15:49:03] <+Moophus> Does the original crafter have to be the person who re-crafts it or can anyone else do it?
[2022-12-30 15:49:07] <%gerryblue> im out of it all the time
[2022-12-30 15:49:18] VIEWERS: 3 121
[2022-12-30 15:49:21] <%+Velanthos> I normally just charge an extra fee to recraft until proc, like an average of 5 craft costs so i can just recraft and send it back R5
[2022-12-30 15:49:29] <BLACKFOOT_TN> I public work ordered 2 different lariat necks. Both came back 5 star.
[2022-12-30 15:49:32] <%Tareah> i don't like the way we are already being abused by crafters for the initial craft too. i put in a personal order for the Lariat and paid high price.. all my mats and wanted rank 5 but was only given rank 4
[2022-12-30 15:49:34] <%Reloe> like I have a lot of people sending in their necks over night for example when they don't need it. Now if I were to send it back when it doesn't hit r5, it's gonna take until the next day. otherwise both people have to be available at the same time and that's just a mess
[2022-12-30 15:50:00] <+y0rge> i only wish they add qualkity option for public order not only private
[2022-12-30 15:50:08] <%Reloe> + a lot of consumers literally don't have any mettle for the recrafts cuz they don't touch the system
[2022-12-30 15:50:11] <karuzo1g> is there a way to import your plater profile?

[2022-12-30 16:30:29] <+Banjo586> i think it has to do with the adds, the size of it

[2022-12-30 16:51:44] <Sparklefartz> @charactersilver convoke is ST builds
[2022-12-30 16:51:46] <Jacksprat47> they know they have a dr, right?
[2022-12-30 16:52:12] <+RyanMeese> why does every good player have their secondary stats displayed like that, seems fairly useless to me
[2022-12-30 16:52:19] <MiguelicusTheGreat> do you use bigwigs or dbm?
[2022-12-30 16:52:25] <@%Kuroz> bigwigs

[2022-12-30 16:56:58] <%+CoffeeCoffeeCoffeehouse> and surv?
[2022-12-30 16:56:58] <Sparklefartz> top runs all have a diff 3rd dps
[2022-12-30 16:57:01] <nixuxas> you also need a lust class, so either evoker healer or enhancement shaman

[2022-12-30 16:57:19] <Sparklefartz> the marksmen hit harder

[2022-12-30 16:57:23] <Sparklefartz> for sure
[2022-12-30 16:57:26] <KinRL> we never pulled those in legion
[2022-12-30 16:57:32] <+RyanMeese> @gnome1614 no, there are 4 new dungeons and 4 old dungeons in m+ right now
[2022-12-30 16:57:32] <Sparklefartz> ^^ also that

[2022-12-30 16:57:52] <gnome1614> @RyanMeese gotcha thanks
[2022-12-30 16:57:58] <+oggokogok> I think a lot of people have also forgotten how to deal with penetrating shot, because you had to pull some in the hallways :D
[2022-12-30 16:58:04] <Sparklefartz> all top m+ runs have prot warrior, Rogue, DH and either an evoker OR a druid healer mostly druids tho
[2022-12-30 16:58:09] <%blonk369> for the leap - only 1 person leaves group?
[2022-12-30 16:58:09] <loggylaggy> do u think hunter better than druid for m+ ?
[2022-12-30 16:58:12] <Brisch_> for me the biggest difference is CoS in the start area it feels so much smaller because somehow the aggro range is different now HMMM
[2022-12-30 16:58:16] <generaljosh721> what weak aura is in the bottom left that is showing the spells casted?
[2022-12-30 16:58:17] <Jacksprat47> double vanish

[2022-12-30 16:58:22] <sleepykaye1> vanish is up very often for outlaw
[2022-12-30 16:58:26] <Jacksprat47> I'd guess
[2022-12-30 16:58:28] <Sparklefartz> HOV changed waaaaaaay more than COS
[2022-12-30 16:58:28] <+RyanMeese> hunter is bad for high keys because we can't survive all the raid dmg lol

[2022-12-30 16:58:34] <+Kethris> outlaw can reset vanish really fast
[2022-12-30 16:58:34] <EdwardLivingston> outlaw can get its cd down to vanish every one natty
[2022-12-30 16:58:35] <sleepykaye1> there is no  double vanish in outlaw.

[2022-12-30 17:28:23] <Sparklefartz> for $200 USD ill give you her plater profile KappaRoss
[2022-12-30 17:28:23] <%Kevin_Arvoo> did that whisper come through btw? ^^ different server etc
[2022-12-30 17:28:25] <Allacros> can you please share your plater profile looks clean tbh
[2022-12-30 17:28:27] <%+LtJenkins> Looking up and down only works so much though. That's my biggest problem. If you're fighting like 10 mobs a bunch will overlap at the top regardless. Might need to change to how you have it where they're allowed to go off screen

[2022-12-30 17:29:55] <Sparklefartz> theres a opacity mod for plater that will put it ON screen if its casting
[2022-12-30 17:29:57] <+Markkloezken> since df the original wow setup with no overlapping overlaps now in the top of the screen and this makes me crazy
[2022-12-30 17:29:59] <%Kevin_Arvoo> we play boomie, who cares about that cast anyway? LUL
[2022-12-30 17:30:07] <+Buzzbee34> seems like they would move less that way, always chasing kiting nameplates

[2022-12-30 17:30:26] <%+LtJenkins> True. But now with how I have them overlapping. an important cast might be blocked by another nameplate because it's overlapping at the top of the screen. Which I feel has gotten me into more trouble.

[2022-12-30 17:33:20] <%+LtJenkins> My understanding of the nameplates is their "order" from bottom to top is based on the mob's position and distance. Is there a way to prioritize a mob so its name plate is always at the bottom of a stack of nameplates?

[2022-12-30 18:06:39] <%paingretzky> @silicone522 some can make with out 3 star diamond, ask the crafter, it can save you a lot of money
[2022-12-30 18:06:47] <+Minzen94> someone here can tell me why go from 25% haste to 18% when i switch in boomie form ? oO and mastery goes up
[2022-12-30 18:07:01] <+Koleigh9> In a few weeks you'll get R5 w/ R1 mats.

[2022-12-30 18:07:02] <Sparklefartz> Vengeful on thrall NA has a high rank5 craft just saying
[2022-12-30 18:07:26] <Milenkan> Plus the recraft mats are very cheap compared to the original. I.E. no diamond needed for recraft.
[2022-12-30 18:07:33] <%warryvibe> pugPls pugPls pugPls
[2022-12-30 18:07:49] <+silicone522> solid info.

[2022-12-30 18:08:06] <chungagunga> i can do r5 with 2* diamond and rest 3* :)
[2022-12-30 18:08:09] <Audi_6> ur probably gonna have to recraft anyways, right? why not just use rank 2 on initial item
[2022-12-30 18:08:09] <PeterPanSmackMan> how does that affect the recraft (using lower mats for initial)
[2022-12-30 18:08:11] <furyii67> if the crafter can get a 5 max craft off 2 star mats it wont matter
[2022-12-30 18:08:12] <%+kritkat1> i miss when i didn't need a flowchart for crafting
[2022-12-30 18:08:13] <+Lam_69> u think 1 pt in umbral is better than 2 pts balance of all things?
[2022-12-30 18:08:15] <chungagunga> people like saving the gold :P
[2022-12-30 18:08:23] <+tsyakaz> crafting full rank 5 is completely luck based with inspiration right now tbh
[2022-12-30 18:08:24] <HairClog> Crafting is going to be a new class you can take in university.

[2022-12-30 19:13:02] <@%^StreamElements> Naguura is the first healer I have seen so far who actually understands her role and is good. She understands that a healer's task is to HEAL, which is why the role name is HEALER. She never deals any damage, because she is not a DAMAGE DEALER role. Hopefully the rest of the healers will catch onto that.

[2022-12-30 19:58:58] <+RainyXDSN> bruh you're gating yourself out of a lot of good shows by not watching anime
[2022-12-30 19:59:00] <+deadrythmix> watch the withcer blood origin mini series, its 4 episodes but they are not bad
[2022-12-30 19:59:01] <%+ajmb97> @Naguura idk if you caught any of the RWF but it was pretty entertaining Kappa Kappa

[2022-12-30 19:59:32] <+biggo0fy> The Peripheral
[2022-12-30 19:59:34] <Algfader> @Naguura Ghosts NA version  (UK version is better tho)
[2022-12-30 19:59:39] <+whiskytrix> its not good
[2022-12-30 19:59:39] <DisGuysLife> That was pretty good, Witcher blood orgin
[2022-12-30 19:59:40] <@%itsClubby> Guys the witcher origin isn't new it only came out a few days ago come on
[2022-12-30 19:59:41] <+Manjoe81> the reviews are horrid
[2022-12-30 19:59:41] <GarretHawke> Blood origin is like bad fan fiction, worse than rings of power
[2022-12-30 19:59:44] <DisGuysLife> Just finished it
[2022-12-30 19:59:45] <drewj_el> theres really not to many good new shows out
[2022-12-30 19:59:45] <BlackTyle> the new witcher spin off is so bad
[2022-12-30 19:59:45] <ali_farlig> Have you seen alice in borderland?
[2022-12-30 19:59:48] <R0seblue> @whiskytrix it is not prequel
[2022-12-30 19:59:50] <+shych00> Blood Origins if you have some time to kill
[2022-12-30 19:59:52] <@%Kuroz> Chatting @Schattenwahn
[2022-12-30 19:59:57] <Archiduss> It's a big step down from the witcher show. Lower budget, and sloppy writing. Uninteresting characters.

[2022-12-30 20:00:12] <HypnosTheHero> Alice in borderland is really good
[2022-12-30 20:00:16] <+whiskytrix> @R0seblue its literally about the origin of witchers. how is that not a prequel?
[2022-12-30 20:00:20] <+Schneidel> you should try to watch Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, those are good animes, for no anime watchers SeemsGood
[2022-12-30 20:00:23] <dese_dese> Carnival row is really good
[2022-12-30 20:00:25] <drewj_el> @Kjempebikkja only when you have nothing else to use

[2022-12-30 20:01:23] <orglethurpp> am i dumb? what is that boomkin form?
[2022-12-30 20:01:24] <BadBurdie> carnival row is fantasy
[2022-12-30 20:01:25] <+emozombiemonkey> Good taste.
[2022-12-30 20:01:27] <%+FafferUK> The Americans is one of the best shows i've watched
[2022-12-30 20:01:27] <DisGuysLife> Cabinet of curiosities was really interesting, low budget tho
[2022-12-30 20:01:28] <+shych00> The Americans?
[2022-12-30 20:01:31] <+owie_tv> it's anime, but I'm not typically into anime and really enjoyed cyberpunk 2077 series
[2022-12-30 20:01:32] <%+Jnxz> Emily in Paris

[2022-12-30 20:01:38] <drewj_el> jack reacher?
[2022-12-30 20:01:44] <BadBurdie> Emily in Paris is my guilty pleasure
[2022-12-30 20:01:45] <HypnosTheHero> The sandman was good
[2022-12-30 20:01:48] <Mr__Flibble_> Justified is old, but sooo good

[2022-12-30 20:02:08] <BlackTyle> 1899
[2022-12-30 20:02:08] <+Shifty41> Apple TV has some bangers. Severance, For All Mankind, Mythic Quest are all excellent
[2022-12-30 20:02:08] <BadBurdie> cara delivigne plays a fairy in carnival row and it's definitely dark
