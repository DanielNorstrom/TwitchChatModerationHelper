[2022-12-15 17:34:13] <!%smokey750> Cheer200 to prove if there is an infinite number of primes, let's assume it is finite and multiply them all together to make a number with a factorization including all primes. if the gcd of two numbers is 1, then these numbers are coprime and have no primes in common. I'll skip to tell you this means you can add or subtract 1 from any number to get a new number that is coprime. so add 1 to the earlier number, and its guaranteed to have only new primes. thus by contradiction, primes are infinite

[2022-12-15 17:39:14] <%$tallpaul84> The Twitch prime sub knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the prime sub from a position where it is to a position where it isn't   Kappa200

[2022-12-15 19:26:44] <!%$DeePick> Cheer200 What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard.

She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
