[2022-12-31 03:33:53] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-31 16:53:20] <WabbitInvictus> @tartgaliar34 It's an mmr or SR based system, in the background is a value that goes up and down depending on whether or not you win. The amount you get is also multiplied by your stats in game so higher states equals more rank "points" and low stats means you get basically nothing. Means you basically can't be carried to higher ranks.

[2022-12-31 17:17:04] <just_gomi> timing and focus
[2022-12-31 17:17:05] <WabbitInvictus> Hog's ult absolutely obliterates a fortified orisa cause she can't get pushed back
[2022-12-31 17:17:05] <%$wasabiroot> without her cooldowns orisa is dead
[2022-12-31 17:17:08] <%+YeetLoaf_Gaming> Sombra is her only counter, but nobody would do ot

[2022-12-31 17:18:17] <WabbitInvictus> I mean orisa is a big target and not very mobile, so zarya won't miss

[2022-12-31 17:25:54] <+bananabread_88> she def needs a buff. She is probably the most fun tank to play yet is essentially a throw pick in the current meta
[2022-12-31 17:25:57] <Shangoshi> i feel like lowering shift cd on junkerqueen by 2 seconds or 3 will make her most played
[2022-12-31 17:25:58] <alignedcornet19> JQ just feels like a really good offtank
[2022-12-31 17:25:59] <+Frostyvy> do you ever get sick of heavy sustain comps (like bap/kiriko) because it feels like nothing dies

[2022-12-31 17:26:03] <%Wonton_Sushi> I think JQ gun should fire a giant mega slug. That will help her DPS output.

[2022-12-31 17:38:03] <+OtelDeraj> I think one of two things need to happen. Either remove the 50 heal and lower the invuln on suzu to .1 second. OR lower the cooldown on suzu and make it a single target ability. I think having a cleanse in the game is good, but it shouldn't just casually heal 250 and cleans the entire team and give them invulnerability.

[2022-12-31 17:38:30] <bygraceonly> Suzu counters other ults tho
[2022-12-31 17:38:31] <OverlordDavid> i could see two knife charges at least
[2022-12-31 17:38:39] <+joolyin4> What is an alec
[2022-12-31 17:38:40] <+TheIceMan9304> you're like the only person streaming right now on twitch
[2022-12-31 17:38:40] <+luxury______0> idk why my phone autocorrected to carico
[2022-12-31 17:38:45] <Panath_> @mamattra 5 is armor
[2022-12-31 17:38:46] <wnderr> @sellingpepsi I mean  she got buffed, everyone recognizes that she is strong this patch, it's hardly an unpopular opinion
[2022-12-31 17:38:49] <+v3ter4n> @emongg make the bleed from her ult do more damage
[2022-12-31 17:38:54] <j_koh> imagine if i culd just suzu ramatra ult and its over
[2022-12-31 17:38:56] <Wizblam> Suzu cooldown should be increased
[2022-12-31 17:38:56] <Shangoshi> i think max range on e with rein swing, makes it feel more natural to play and hit
[2022-12-31 17:38:59] <viljarkt> Hello
[2022-12-31 17:39:04] <$GOODESTEREST> hi
[2022-12-31 17:39:08] <%blubsabunny> lmao
[2022-12-31 17:39:12] <Shangoshi> right now it feels to much like punch range
[2022-12-31 17:39:14] <Panath_> hes not moving back
[2022-12-31 17:39:18] <+JohnTheCat25> Suzu should be single target and not AOE
[2022-12-31 17:39:19] <+Sakeriel> But invalidating a characters kit by selectively changing ability interactions is avoiding the issue and would add to consistency issues.

[2022-12-31 17:39:47] <+Cake_Shot> Does carnage heal more than gracie or is all bleed 1.25
[2022-12-31 17:39:49] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> @j_koh well they're talking about increasing suzu to last for 4 or 5 seconds, so that would be able to counter a full ramattra ult
[2022-12-31 17:39:50] <wnderr> @luxury______0 her swift step cleanses because that's a mechanic that all similar abilities have in common (reaper, moira, sombra etc)

[2022-12-31 17:40:14] <robmygob> i think junker queen, at least in terms of fun is one of the best designed heroes in the game. its just her little survivability makes her a little less fun

[2022-12-31 17:40:31] <%Lloyder_> did u know genji can deflect her axe atk we should nerf him
[2022-12-31 17:40:31] <RastyBhobooty> mabe te could add a fix pattern for the shotgun so that reduce te random pellet and give her more range the damage it's fine
[2022-12-31 17:40:32] <+Tookiegrl20> Can you explain Lucio?

[2022-12-31 17:41:05] <+hiimfatter> there should be a concept similar to league of legend's "grievous wounds". jq's ult's should apply "grievous wounds" That slow down the rate of healing/effect of cleanse etc.

[2022-12-31 17:46:01] <messhy09> Reins really good on my silver ranked matched, just pin and smash enemies
[2022-12-31 17:46:05] <maccabe> And maybe firestrike buff

[2022-12-31 17:46:16] <Bepponji> he is a slow brawler, if you think related to other tanks
[2022-12-31 17:46:16] <+rnowill> His cooldowns just needs to be more defensive like orisa. Maybe give him a harden ability
[2022-12-31 17:46:17] <%Lloyder_> @Lloyder_ my legs hurt i have to hold the huge sheild i cannot just walk too

[2022-12-31 17:46:45] <ChatoGuy1> i think it genuinely depends on that a certain play style and not so much of what hero does better. heroes just makes it easier for certain play styles to do better

[2022-12-31 17:50:22] <wnderr> 2CP was kinda fun on attack and a horrible bore on defense IMO
[2022-12-31 17:50:25] <%laurent_of_vere_vi> also most of them were  lore related
[2022-12-31 17:50:26] <%+YeetLoaf_Gaming> 2 CP is better in 5v5
[2022-12-31 17:50:27] <Ski751> after trying it in arcade 2 cp seems like ether defend first point its a steamroll

[2022-12-31 17:50:56] <sapphirestarr164> so to hit orisa javelin you need to aim to the left
[2022-12-31 17:50:56] <Ski751> I hope  they revert that change, it shoudln't go through shields
[2022-12-31 17:51:02] <TrueStoryOW> thats A pretty dumb part of it

[2022-12-31 17:51:30] <AveryBrown14> Roadhog is too fat. Thats his problem
[2022-12-31 17:51:30] <wnderr> I was expecting them to just rework most 2CP maps into payload maps, I'd be down with that
[2022-12-31 17:51:31] <KrlOnTwitch> is his system clock always visible? :-)

[2022-12-31 17:52:31] <+bcdank> orisa is less aggravating
[2022-12-31 17:52:33] <+lazorbheemz> atleast with orisa you have a chance to try and fight back rather than just straight up one shot for hog
[2022-12-31 17:52:36] <Ski751> Orisa should only be immune to soft cc during fortifty
[2022-12-31 17:52:37] <%Lloyder_> i guess u havent been pinned in a corner by the spin with nothing u can do
[2022-12-31 17:52:42] <uptightpanic70> @Peekiimon facts

[2022-12-31 17:52:50] <ilkat06> It‚Äôs really satisfying hooking people tho
[2022-12-31 17:53:15] <%blubsabunny> nice
[2022-12-31 17:53:17] <TrueStoryOW> if ur dps werent doing as much that hog could get away with playing like that

[2022-12-31 17:53:34] <OverlordDavid> Orisa cant one shot in the way that hog can, she is much less infuriating
[2022-12-31 17:53:42] <ilkat06> @emongg yeah I get that true
[2022-12-31 17:53:42] <Wizblam> Hog's always been my favorite, I don't want him to get reworked, the hook is everything to me
[2022-12-31 17:53:44] <%$DeIta9> I love how he's YAPPP ing and murdering the other team at the same time KEKW

[2022-12-31 17:53:50] <%Culein_> Hook should remain, thats fun, but maybe nor be able to shoot right after

[2022-12-31 17:54:03] <messhy09> I don't really play shooters, I play RPGs and Hack n Slash, but I really enjoyed overwatch, I can play characters that doesn't need aiming like Reinhardt, Winston, Torbjorn and Moira
[2022-12-31 17:54:06] <Peekiimon> Instead of hooking people in he will bounce them back with his belly üòå

[2022-12-31 17:54:36] <+just_hutch> Hog should be able to wall climb that would balance him

[2022-12-31 17:59:10] <WabbitInvictus> @Shangoshi Not really they just need to give us more heroes
[2022-12-31 17:59:11] <greedygreenbird> Controversial opinion. I don't think support in a super bad spot right now. All 8 are somewhat viable.
[2022-12-31 17:59:13] <+bananabread_88> suzu cooldown needs to be longer maybe? Not really fair how long Baptiste cage cooldown is compared to Kirko
[2022-12-31 17:59:15] <2ty15> @andiewastaken Ana is the counter to hog, but Kiriko is the counter to Ana. So Hog doesn't have counters
[2022-12-31 17:59:18] <WabbitInvictus> 8 supports and 11 tanks is not balanced

[2022-12-31 18:00:09] <RavenStormfall> My problem with the community and the game in general is that everyone is too afraid of anything being remotely good unless it suits their own interests. It's fine to have strong characters, just have fun and add more of it so there isn't so much crying for needless nerfs.
[2022-12-31 18:00:11] <bygraceonly> Ana used to counter hog, next  best  thing  is Zen  but you still need a fair amount  of focus

[2022-12-31 18:01:50] <PayneofTrain> Ana actually counters hog in bronze because Bronze Kirikos don't ever use suzu on their tank
[2022-12-31 18:01:53] <evnoga09> I heard Flats say that maybe they could rework Hog and shorten hook cooldown. He said they could make changes to where Hogs play style is more about repositioning people rather than one shotting.

[2022-12-31 18:02:10] <OverlordDavid> hog should get full stunned out of his ult like Sigma can be
[2022-12-31 18:02:11] <WabbitInvictus> And as an ana main I can say you will never be able to sleep a good kiriko
[2022-12-31 18:02:14] <messhy09> nope, Kiriko uses Suzu for healing on my Silver Ranked matches not for cleansing, they do try though but most of the time  the timing is not right

[2022-12-31 18:02:47] <$rhettthejet> Thoughts on Torb getting a hammer buff?
[2022-12-31 18:02:48] <+InterruptingA10> @sunny_boy17 for me being a support main, my main frustration is my DPS not actually killing anything, leaving me to die to actually competent DPS.

[2022-12-31 18:03:02] <Julicapo100> maybe change to a less affected tank?

[2022-12-31 18:03:14] <sapphirestarr164> what if they increase the cool down for suzu.
[2022-12-31 18:03:16] <WabbitInvictus> @satanten Still very weak since every other support has a get out of jail card but he doesn't
[2022-12-31 18:03:17] <PuxkVainglory> @sunny_boy17 play zen kill things yourself thats what i do
[2022-12-31 18:03:19] <%stephstephy> lol @julicapo100 do less?
[2022-12-31 18:03:20] <andiewastaken> i feel like suzu should have a cooldown similar to bap's cooldowns since its so strong, no?
[2022-12-31 18:03:21] <Empress_Quail> that is a rlly cute orisa skin
[2022-12-31 18:03:35] <andiewastaken> i think 12-15 seconds would be better
[2022-12-31 18:03:35] <WabbitInvictus> But apart from survivability he obliterates people

[2022-12-31 18:03:56] <+shallowthought> play support like a crappier dps and you can occasionally diff
[2022-12-31 18:04:03] <genetic_lemon> baptiste is the best support to solo queue because you can actually deal damage too...kiriko also.
[2022-12-31 18:04:03] <+nuudles_18> that was on kiriko
[2022-12-31 18:04:21] <+Twizx_> Javelin kills are so satisfying lol
[2022-12-31 18:04:30] <andiewastaken> zen is really only good if you have another support that can dish out a TON of healing to make up for his low healing output
[2022-12-31 18:04:34] <bygraceonly> Discord counters a ton of stuff if your team  will protect  you lol
[2022-12-31 18:04:34] <astruzipg> i literally solo queue with mercy

[2022-12-31 18:04:41] <+InterruptingA10> @andiewastaken ana gets two things to shut down people, kiriko gets one cleanse. I think the issue is elsewhere, like Hog just being that good
[2022-12-31 18:04:43] <lucas46g> I hope they just revert the orisa damage falloff off and don‚Äôt nerf anything else because she will prob be nerfed
[2022-12-31 18:04:46] <astruzipg> high heals just to love
[2022-12-31 18:04:48] <+shallowthought> but trying to play a pure support in 5v5 straight up doesn't work
[2022-12-31 18:04:49] <WabbitInvictus> @genetic_lemon I would say bap is the third best option first two being kiriko and mercy

[2022-12-31 18:09:50] <WabbitInvictus> @iliketoeatpineapples Rein is good to damage boost actually as I think it lets him two shot most squishies, hanzo is a mid tier pick and widow is as well. Although at that point if you're playing hanzo, widow and rein you've most likely lost

[2022-12-31 18:11:19] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @WabbitInvictus you're coping if you think rein is good to damage boost  KEKW   the only situation that mercy is good in a whole game is when you're whole team is rolling the other team even if the only thing that is needed from mercy is her res and ult

[2022-12-31 18:11:54] <%Nennai> @dasdardly best think you can do is to keep endorsing others, and just be pleasent to play with. it's harder now to maintain because you cant endorse the enemy team anymore

[2022-12-31 18:14:12] <+InterruptingA10> @iliketoeatpineapples agreed, the 1 tank change was a sea change and i like it. It actually gives ebb and flow to fights rather than "oh our tank is dead, heres the other tank while the first respawns"
[2022-12-31 18:14:15] <%$zenb0tta> Kiriko really has high utility/effectiveness at high ranks. She‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve hit a new career high of GM4 and briefly Top 500.

[2022-12-31 18:14:23] <TheOneMartial> give orisa bongo with damage reduction instead of fortify as an ability, gives more counter play to the enemy while orisa can still protect herself

[2022-12-31 18:17:25] <evnoga09> I heard Flats say that maybe they could rework Hog and shorten hook cooldown. He said they could make changes to where Hogs play style is more about repositioning people rather than one shotting. He said they could potentially make it to where you could hook people and pull them behind you.

[2022-12-31 18:19:02] <narwhalpod> hello
[2022-12-31 18:19:02] <+saltrules23> i had no idea that went through shields
[2022-12-31 18:19:04] <uni_Mafuyu> Thank you so much for the explanation!
[2022-12-31 18:19:08] <+naaasch> i think they should give Junker Queen partial healing reduction to her bleeding attacks
[2022-12-31 18:19:19] <+shmagey9380> !watchtime
[2022-12-31 18:19:29] <+goatphish> what if zen could assign more than one healing orbs (ex: 3) but there would be 3 fewer orbs available for charge up damage? it would add a lot of flexibility
[2022-12-31 18:19:38] <cjfm101> been away from OW2 since Ram, is his ult strong? if you stay tethered it is forever right?
[2022-12-31 18:19:43] <%blubsabunny> that dude messes my team uo fr
[2022-12-31 18:19:43] <watchesdragons> Do you add in the quick melee in nemesis?
[2022-12-31 18:19:53] <SunsetSpark> that would be a nightmare
[2022-12-31 18:19:55] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @alignedcornet19 unfortunately my friend, don't. it will just left you disappointed. also if blizz decided to bring back lootboxes, be prepared for the RNG of obtaining good cosmetics to be so random  LUL
[2022-12-31 18:19:59] <%Lloyder_> so junkqueens bleed dont reduce healing i thought it did?
[2022-12-31 18:20:00] <narwhalpod> how long of a stream u going to do
[2022-12-31 18:20:02] <BITNNWasTaken> !watchtime
[2022-12-31 18:20:02] <maccabe> JQ can proc a lot of bleed
[2022-12-31 18:20:03] <+Redmeteorite> if it was it would have to be a longer cooldown
[2022-12-31 18:20:06] <Ultra_Lide> do you know that ram punch skill? the one makes you can punch really fast
[2022-12-31 18:20:12] <shottie817> whats mortal strike?

[2022-12-31 18:20:59] <Ultra_Lide> so this one can block at same time?
[2022-12-31 18:21:01] <wnderr> @iliketoeatpineapples lootboxes in overwatch were one of the least predatory monetization methods of any modern game

[2022-12-31 18:21:16] <br00ks2710> Is hanzo still worth palying???

[2022-12-31 18:21:37] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @wnderr true but remember that it's now F2P. blizz will definitely succumb to that F2P RNG lootbox style.

[2022-12-31 18:26:15] <doximanman> it helps to know how many people died but its better to know WHO exactly died, a dps dying is more winnable than the tank dying

You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops/inventory

[2022-12-31 18:37:38] <evnoga09> I heard Flats say that maybe they could rework Hog and shorten hook cooldown. He said they could make changes to where Hogs play style is more about repositioning people rather than one shotting. He said they could potentially make it to where you could hook people and pull them behind you.

[2022-12-31 19:05:34] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @beetlevoice2771 sigma's pretty bad against winston and rein. although when it comes to rein, as long as you keep your distance from him, you can punish him. dps will be flankers like tracer and i think reaper can also punish him but if you play your cooldowns right, you can kill reaper or always calls out his teleport and shift

[2022-12-31 19:11:16] <%Lloyder_> now ask how many like push LUL
[2022-12-31 19:11:17] <%bambamu_> if they reworked hanamura into a payload or hybrid map i'll be happy
[2022-12-31 19:11:18] <dogwater_5> why not
[2022-12-31 19:11:20] <a_spudulike> It's good for 5v5 stacks or ACTUAL teams
[2022-12-31 19:11:22] <+naaasch> is numbani coming back??
[2022-12-31 19:11:23] <dogwater_5> ?
[2022-12-31 19:11:26] <Nakl89> I'd rather just be allowed to install OW1 again lol
[2022-12-31 19:11:26] <maccabe> How do you feel about map rotations each season? I miss Numbani
[2022-12-31 19:11:33] <+mrpicklebeen> @XxGingerNinjax play around them
[2022-12-31 19:11:34] <UsernameTooLong> it doesnt play well in 5v5, it's essentially death match
[2022-12-31 19:11:40] <BoxByJihi_> weirdly enough i like 2cp better then push
[2022-12-31 19:11:41] <+Derciusz> LuvPeekR LuvPeekR

[2022-12-31 19:11:46] <AN_AWKWARD_SILENCE> remember 2CP with mercy's entire team res ult lul
[2022-12-31 19:11:53] <CassiHikari> Emong, los a bot with a bot with Rama ult
[2022-12-31 19:11:55] <abradoll> and 2cp had the worst snowballing
[2022-12-31 19:11:56] <%+jet4sale> 2nd point you needed to win 3 team fight in a row LUL
[2022-12-31 19:11:58] <+XxGingerNinjax> @mrpicklebeen I can‚Äôt when they all split up and play all around the map tho
[2022-12-31 19:12:03] <%+omnideoist> Hanamura is very iconic, remake map TANTIES
[2022-12-31 19:12:06] <%Nennai> having map roations when there's only 3-5 maps per gamemode is pointless
[2022-12-31 19:12:07] <xOkabeRintaro> is ramatra good against hog?
[2022-12-31 19:12:12] <%$TnT_06> ive played rialto like 4 times this season
[2022-12-31 19:12:15] <%notthemarvelousmike> I actually don't think I've gotten Kings Row in like 3 days
[2022-12-31 19:12:17] <ChronoAura> I got the Shambali map 1 time, in an 8 hour session.
[2022-12-31 19:12:18] <tracuz1> 2cp is so trash, glad it's gone but I do miss the maps
[2022-12-31 19:12:18] <UsernameTooLong> zumbani what map is that? sounds like a myth
[2022-12-31 19:12:24] <dogwater_5> why not they bring 2cp and push
[2022-12-31 19:12:27] <samepuddle> I think push would be better with more balanced matchmaking. While map control on them is critical winning 2 team fights in a row guarantees u that first checkpoint which then handicaps u for test of match

[2022-12-31 19:12:28] <+Falver1> @xOkabeRintaro nope
[2022-12-31 19:12:31] <maccabe> Yeah I hate it so much
[2022-12-31 19:12:31] <MattGx_> playing against widow + mercy while attacking would be miserable with one less tank
[2022-12-31 19:12:33] <+mrpicklebeen> @XxGingerNinjax thats tough. use team chat and ask for specific plays

[2022-12-31 19:14:32] <UsernameTooLong> yeah the 2cp in the pubs was awful to watch. fun watch but awful for the players
[2022-12-31 19:14:38] <%N30NxL1T3x> plant them in the ground emongW
[2022-12-31 19:14:39] <Bennjii__> Imagine 2cp with ramattra or new Orisa ult LUL
[2022-12-31 19:14:39] <+BuildingValhalla> hey what mouse sensitivity do yall use?
[2022-12-31 19:14:40] <Ag3L3s> What about Widening The Map And Less Choke Points
[2022-12-31 19:14:40] <CassiHikari> Hanamura is also the most fun thing in the world to say
[2022-12-31 19:14:44] <ChronoAura> Choke point design was a mistake in 2CP maps.
[2022-12-31 19:14:47] <+Aces_High_76> Expand the 2 cp maps to include a 3rd point, and make it 3 point control.

[2022-12-31 19:15:01] <wastedneko> lmao i always left paris, especially on attack bc i already knew the orisa/torb/sym or junkrat were gonna hold us all game
[2022-12-31 19:15:04] <cjfm101> I remember when there was no hero limit just run 6 Dva's into first point annubis
[2022-12-31 19:15:10] <sotman224> but we dont know, how are those maps with just 1 tank, they should give them a chance after the new team comp
[2022-12-31 19:15:11] <scopezQC> 15min queue fun game

[2022-12-31 19:15:21] <+naaasch> i think i'd play a self-healing tank in low elo and try to get picks
[2022-12-31 19:15:22] <%notthemarvelousmike> not the hogmaker
[2022-12-31 19:15:22] <samepuddle> Sniper tanks r rough to watch and play with

[2022-12-31 19:15:29] <Nathinai> I mean what's the difference between 2 cp and cap the point tho .... It feels a bit the same to me
[2022-12-31 19:15:31] <%Nennai> @wastedneko honestly that chke point can do rot in a dumpster
[2022-12-31 19:15:33] <%$Kidritch> cohhNotes  w-widow..hog
[2022-12-31 19:15:33] <%Rachel3107> Yep they don‚Äôt push on lower ranks or push wayyy too much

[2022-12-31 19:15:48] <8pigguy> I love this emote
[2022-12-31 19:15:55] <Ag3L3s> True
[2022-12-31 19:15:57] <%DriverSim> Whoever spams the choke better usually wins
[2022-12-31 19:15:59] <%+jet4sale> let me tell you, LHC played the same way
[2022-12-31 19:16:01] <ChronoAura> 2CP in 5v5 was literally Tank Bullying simulator.
[2022-12-31 19:16:03] <cjfm101> @Vent_YeahManThatsCool hehe yea
[2022-12-31 19:16:03] <%+kettledkorn> I got a feeling the next tank might be a sniper
[2022-12-31 19:16:04] <%+jet4sale> LUL
[2022-12-31 19:16:08] <%Nennai> and less cc
[2022-12-31 19:16:09] <Nakl89> that sounds like a balance issue and not a mode issue lol
[2022-12-31 19:16:09] <JerryGuy> But why pick ball stall when you can pick doom
[2022-12-31 19:16:15] <+Arnii115> Agree
[2022-12-31 19:16:20] <+AGOFF1> I hate the new ranking system in ow the 7 wins or 20 losses or whatever it is.. seems stupid not knowing your rank
[2022-12-31 19:16:26] <+WillHalo4Fun> why dont they just make ram ult end at some point
[2022-12-31 19:16:31] <cjfm101> I want more supports :(
[2022-12-31 19:16:36] <DrDoomMDPhD> Are tanks too strong compared to dps and support? @emongg

[2022-12-31 19:17:47] <beetlevoice2771> as a tank and the enemy widow is terrorizing my team, do i have to play winston / dva to pressure them or leave it to my dps as its "not my job"?
[2022-12-31 19:17:50] <DemonStrate86> I like the "Sit and Ride" time with Ramattra.
[2022-12-31 19:17:52] <%ne0n_black> anubis first is soooooo good tho
[2022-12-31 19:17:55] <JerryGuy> is ball getting buffed any time soon?

[2022-12-31 19:18:06] <n0skun0ss0> What if they added more points to 2cp maps and treat it like a domination style gamemode?
[2022-12-31 19:18:07] <+pennypasta3> 8-7s? omg i got sick of the map by 4-5 lol
[2022-12-31 19:18:13] <busser22> its this coming week i think
[2022-12-31 19:18:14] <ChronoAura> Can't wait for the Junker Queen buffs.
[2022-12-31 19:18:18] <%Nennai> @beetlevoice2771 if no one is pressuring them, you will have to do it - otherwise nobody is

[2022-12-31 19:18:37] <+pennypasta3> thats fair lol
[2022-12-31 19:18:40] <Nakl89> oh yea
[2022-12-31 19:18:45] <%DriverSim> My favorite thing about 2cp was when there was a clear better team and the map ended in 3 minutes
[2022-12-31 19:18:52] <+pennypasta3> @DriverSim lmao
[2022-12-31 19:18:55] <Toddlesworth> basically its like enjoying when it rains in your prison cell so you can drink the water that pools on the ground
[2022-12-31 19:18:55] <%Lloyder_> what do u think of no push in comp?
[2022-12-31 19:18:58] VIEWERS: 11¬†956
[2022-12-31 19:19:00] <luazri> it was mostly 2-1 for me

[2022-12-31 19:19:17] <%Nennai> 2-0, 2-1s
[2022-12-31 19:19:18] <abradoll> imo the biggest problem with 2 cp is the absurd snowballing, the game can often be decided based on the first team fight
[2022-12-31 19:19:22] <+enreves> Nothing more fun than 45 min draws YEP

[2022-12-31 19:20:48] <%Nennai> @beetlevoice2771 sometimes it do be like that, but I feel with ow2 the idea is to try to ignore the other tank, and kill the backline - otherwise that tank probably isnt dying anyway
[2022-12-31 19:20:49] <Toddlesworth> we got this team KEKW
[2022-12-31 19:20:51] <+Aqua_Phobix> anything u can do as 1 person tho?

[2022-12-31 19:21:09] <Ominath> I don't think I've played a game recently that didn't have a hog as the tank.
[2022-12-31 19:21:10] <%bkrocks29> game
[2022-12-31 19:21:13] <%NightRemedy> Hog has always been hog... it's Kiriko that is enabling him so hard now

[2022-12-31 19:21:20] <+naaasch> @Aqua_Phobix in low elos i'd give priority to orisa since she has higher survivabilty
[2022-12-31 19:21:20] <Bepponji> Hog is the classic DPS check of a boss in a mmorpg. but you can never reach the suggested lvl neither ilvl to have a match with it

[2022-12-31 19:21:24] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> @Aqua_Phobix either kill their supports with 1 shot heroes and then target focus hog, or excellent target focus

[2022-12-31 19:22:04] <+Squirrelbits4u> Isn't hog losing his one shot hook?
[2022-12-31 19:22:04] <%ne0n_black> @Aqua_Phobix you can deny every single hook on hog with your cooldowns. Even if a teammate gets hooked if you walk into the hog with spin it will block the follow up damage. The problem is that you're never killing the hog (and the hog is never killing you) and you're absolutely hopeless at killing the enemy dps on orisa
[2022-12-31 19:22:05] <grey_tew_tuff> e

[2022-12-31 19:59:17] <maxlakhman> Why is English only???
[2022-12-31 19:59:19] <ChronoAura> What if you do what the Hog did, 2 matches ago? just walk past the Orisa?
[2022-12-31 19:59:19] <+Bubba7021> the whole team has to shoot him when he's ulting or he destroys
[2022-12-31 19:59:19] <borborygmusattack> @Josejayrivas naturally they want to win more...its about who is the strongest too
[2022-12-31 19:59:20] <Josejayrivas> i like zarya to dive the supports

[2022-12-31 19:59:32] <%ne0n_black> @Josejayrivas yeah he's solid no doubt! You're gonna struggle into certain comps, though, and as you rank up the enemy team will know what to do. Bastion struggles against pharah/mercy and tanks like dva, orisa, and sig who have time based damage mitigation (instead of health based like a shield or raw hp)
[2022-12-31 19:59:39] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @maxlakhman hard to moderate if there's a lot of languages

[2022-12-31 20:09:52] <%$TheNastyFridge> @xwalmart I think the problem with Rein is that he's exclusively short-range, and he can only do one thing at a time - while other heroes can mitigate damage and still do damage. So Rein gets often outranged AND outdamaged by other tanks

[2022-12-31 20:24:32] <@%^StreamElements> Halvalla_, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2022-12-31 20:39:23] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @Chitma_Pance ah i see. i though you were asking as to why the enemy team is always on top of that map. well in their case as to why are going for the top is to take away that advantage. so let's say that they did what you want and force to go to that point, they'll get pick off first because they enemy team has the high ground advantage. this isn't silver/gold that you can just "walk" to point
[2022-12-31 20:39:26] <%+pennypasta3> @pennypasta3 @Nennai thats interesting. Cause i went from hardstuck 2750 to now mid diamond with hardly any effort

[2022-12-31 22:33:01] <%+omnideoist> @peachhhice_ also right click is good because of one shotting more often, not only because you can shoot down a choke for a kill. so if you're fighting a sig, rein, etc., volley shield instead of left click. you can burst someone down if they drop shield. try to charge at someone behind the shield too. like aim for the person behind shield, not the tank
