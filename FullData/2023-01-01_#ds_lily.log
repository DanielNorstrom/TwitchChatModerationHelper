[2023-01-01 00:06:30] <sadrobot526> 800 eggs perday   20 years 365 x 20  7300 days * 800  After about two years the queen starts to produce males and females who begin to  leave and start other colonies. Usually in a carpenter ant colony there i only one queen  6570 of those years the queen makes male and female ie more queens   10 to 20 a day are female   5.84 million in eggs from one queen in 20 years doesn't seems rightbutwhatever   total beings is like 767 billion spawned from one queen in20 years

[2023-01-01 18:15:19] <Ftom14cat> all the wall outlets in a room usually share a 20 amp breaker. A space heater alone probably runs 10+ of those amps, so with an older computer you would be close to maxing out the breaker

[2023-01-01 18:18:41] <UnboundSouls> the way chaos damage normally works is that it ignores your energy shield and hits life directly
[2023-01-01 18:18:44] <Saintgein> Chaos damage normally bypasses energy shield.

[2023-01-01 19:56:47] <TheBestJoe> probably only cast
[2023-01-01 19:56:53] <%polibidophlin> it works if the phrasing is "casts despair on hit" it does not work if the phrasing is "apply despair on hit"
[2023-01-01 19:56:55] <TheBestJoe> on hit is a 'trigger' which is distinctly not cast
[2023-01-01 19:57:15] <%majesticdolphin> ^

[2023-01-01 21:35:22] <+Slamrish> Are you taking advantage of the differences your mental makeup or are you trying to play the game everyone that doesn't have ADHD have?
[2023-01-01 21:35:37] <+ethhill1> They're finding ADHD is a syndrome:  a group of symptoms.  Any individiual may have some or all of them.  They're also finding a lot of overlap with autism.

[2023-01-01 21:39:11] <+lordsmite> Yeah I think a lot of people show symptoms that indicate adhd but its not full blown
[2023-01-01 21:39:14] <Kantyash> you should try taking meds and the response will tell you a lot Lily LUL
[2023-01-01 21:39:15] <%+Citruss_PUNCH> everyone thought that

[2023-01-01 21:43:41] <Feels2k> Like anything, you develop a psuedo dependancy and your brain no longer produces a sufficient amount of a subset of chemicals due to its reliance on the external source
[2023-01-01 21:43:41] <%majesticdolphin> the block chain is super different
[2023-01-01 21:43:44] <%Useless_Eater> Hmm yeah tiny differences can mean A LOT
[2023-01-01 21:43:47] <rixaN_> yea its big
