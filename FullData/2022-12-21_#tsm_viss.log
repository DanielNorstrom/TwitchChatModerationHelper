[2022-12-21 16:12:58] <JJomrx> good starting point, with good loot
[2022-12-21 16:13:01] <+ZeroCool70> I agree what you are saying about bullies but I also think that driving around in a car like that is kind of weak game play. But grats on the win if that’s how you want to win I guess.
[2022-12-21 16:13:14] <%jd933> @TSM_Viss I feel like people who started with early fortnite, PUBG or Arma really learned the value of looting and strategy.  People who joined BR with Apex/Warzone just think it's TDM still and if you're not fighting in 3 min "you're a coward".  Apex player since it came out and solo queueing has become impossible recently
[2022-12-21 16:13:35] <%+Nordhauser> @ZeroCool70 there's about 9 counters in the game for vehicles and none were used on him, poor reasoning there

[2022-12-21 16:14:59] <%Ninj4doggy> @monsderrman leave em bro... they ain't gonna listen to anyone.. it's a waste of time... I have tried irl
[2022-12-21 16:15:05] <%jd933> It's so dumb to me like why not check a couple extra buildings or pods when you have a f tier loadout or you'll be on mic saying I have a P2020 still let me find a real gun and your team is pushing then mic lights up "why aren't you fighting" LUL I told you have patience
[2022-12-21 16:15:11] <%+Kreeped> Yeah, driving is loud and actually attracts players. Staying mobile is great and he hunts people down as necessary, its 1 strategy in the sea of many, winnings what matters.
