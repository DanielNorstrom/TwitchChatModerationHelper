[2023-01-02 16:05:22] <Finnen78> @Kandyland and you can do this with the majority of objects/people in finnish... its like when swedes put "en" or "ett" before a word or bending it from Hund to Hunden... we finns just go a wee bit further. to properly learn finnish you need to learn about 6-7 cases of the finnish language, there is like 15-18 cases. :)

[2023-01-02 18:16:52] <%Shanzul> Yeah I am playing it now. So far I like it better than BFA and Shadowlands. The profession system feels intuitive. The flying has a dynamic system. Love the dungeons and the zones with the music.

[2023-01-02 18:19:54] <%Oretobar> the pvp progression system back then was so bad - you were basically forced to play more than anyone else on the server to get to the highest rank, so I played 16+ hours per day for like 14 weeks until I got it LUL
