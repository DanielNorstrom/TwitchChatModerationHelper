[2022-12-16 10:43:05] <%ttkartemis> I mean, technically Zeus gave his approval for Hades to marry Persephony... he just didn't tell that to Persephone

[2022-12-16 10:43:38] <Karsusthemad> To be fair... the Persephone case was more Zeus giving his brother a bride... and it's technically built upon a far older myth lost to time
[2022-12-16 10:43:44] <%ThatOneSwordGuy> Zeus was the one behind the persephone yoink
[2022-12-16 10:43:49] <mikks_wav> Keep in mind when these myths were written though
[2022-12-16 10:43:52] <therealaaron_> @raigeki55 I like Dionysus but thats bc I learnt about him whilst learning about Pompeii
[2022-12-16 10:44:01] <%+rikunort> same voice actor as zaggy
[2022-12-16 10:44:05] <mikks_wav> like its fucked up by our standards, yes, but there are themes at play that should color the interpretation
[2022-12-16 10:44:06] <%Scathlile> Entirely depends on which iteration of the story you listen to. Some it's kidnap, some he was approved to be with her by her father (Zeus) and they only eloped because Demeter didn't approve

[2022-12-16 10:47:02] <mikks_wav> @mikks_wav I do not speak greek, much less ANCIENT greek, but this is just how mythologies go lol
[2022-12-16 10:47:03] <%+Dumbass_Gremlin> @mikks_wav Especially since a lot of our knowledge and the commonly used stories of Greek mythology comes from Ovid's Metamorphesis (since its the most collected version and accessible version and got used as such) as if he wasn't a full on Roman poet that wrote Metamorphesis as a thinly veiled criticism of roman politicians in which he compared them to gods and used the gods to speak on the shit they did
[2022-12-16 10:47:05] <%ThatOneSwordGuy> she can be very op

[2022-12-16 11:33:03] <%raigeki55> Hermes's are mostly supportive, he doesn't have offensive boons like the other gods. Regardless of run though, you will always have a chance of running into Hermes. Everyone else is randomized, he's a constant. Probably has something to do with nature as a Psychopomp

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[2022-12-16 15:32:36] <@%TheMoenia> Cheer100 i looked this up and now you have to suffer along with me. A penis fracture differs from other fractures in the body because the penis has no bones. During an erection, the penis is engorged with blood that fills two cylinders (corpora cavernosa). If an engorged penis is bent suddenly or forcefully, the trauma can rupture the outer lining of one of the two cylinders (tunica albuginea). This can result in a penis fracture.
