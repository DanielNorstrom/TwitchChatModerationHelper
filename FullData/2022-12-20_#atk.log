[2022-12-20 10:16:25] <zel777> kuku isn't immune right?

[2022-12-20 10:16:46] <+Henryjaw> actually true

[2022-12-20 10:17:13] <@%+Shikiro> imagine if GLs and Destroyers could have 100% taunted
[2022-12-20 10:17:17] <ikigami_ikigai> supports and gunlancers are always welcome for a party
[2022-12-20 10:17:19] <zel777> cause i swear i saw our destro taunt kuku during basic pattern in g3, and he ended up taunting flame tower too and it didn't spit flame
[2022-12-20 10:17:31] <BigBeeBEAR> Well thank you guys for the information o/
[2022-12-20 10:17:33] <+Henryjaw> heavy armor bard with rhapsody
[2022-12-20 10:17:55] <+Henryjaw> literal tank
[2022-12-20 10:18:08] <%+the_pikahu> well dps classes are also mandatory lol
[2022-12-20 10:18:14] <+AntipainK> Well, I wished they had made more of such synergies, instead of this "1 effect on some skill"
[2022-12-20 10:18:17] <%+Ryougui> @zel777 taunt only works for that tower
[2022-12-20 10:18:30] <+Henryjaw> wait wtf
[2022-12-20 10:18:33] <macenkrace> you're not forced, you can go without support, it's just harder
[2022-12-20 10:18:37] <%+the_pikahu> and much more dps players
[2022-12-20 10:18:41] <@%+Shikiro> @zel777 kukul can't be taunted can confirm. but the flame tower I'd have to try out
[2022-12-20 10:18:43] <zel777> @Ryougui ahh
[2022-12-20 10:18:44] <+Henryjaw> 21:3 really i never really counted
[2022-12-20 10:18:50] <%+JinXv> @macenkrace when progging on ilevel content, its mandatory.
[2022-12-20 10:18:51] <+Henryjaw> theres 21 dps jobs?
[2022-12-20 10:18:56] <+Henryjaw> damn
[2022-12-20 10:19:06] <@%+Shikiro> 3dps 1 support

[2022-12-20 10:19:12] <+AntipainK> Playing without a support makes you realize how many people don't actually know the boss mechanics
[2022-12-20 10:19:26] <%+dreweezyy> @zel777 taunt disables flame tower for sure
[2022-12-20 10:19:26] <%+kuroauggyyy> u can taunt flame tower and it reset the flame spitting out
[2022-12-20 10:19:37] <+ForeverSleepDeprived> Thanks for your guides ATK! Cleared gate 6 today and feel very thankful I didn't have to do it blind
[2022-12-20 10:19:49] <+AntipainK> Same thing for playing on iLvL. People just got used to tanking some attacks like its nothing
[2022-12-20 10:19:49] <kokomqfka> but for the little of us that play support it is heaven 🤣🤣
[2022-12-20 10:19:57] <zel777> ye lmao, learned that the hard way

[2022-12-20 10:20:27] <%yoohyeonisn> so always taunt the flame tower atkNoted
[2022-12-20 10:20:30] <%+n0m4d_x> isn't it an easy solution for low support players to make support affect the 2 parties? @ATK
[2022-12-20 10:20:33] <+hermiowne> yearning is too op
[2022-12-20 10:20:34] <+Henryjaw> they made support madatory

[2022-12-20 10:21:28] <+mattyydubzz> is there a title you get from completing south vern adventure tome?
[2022-12-20 10:21:30] <+lagnumber> All you need is 4x3 lmao
[2022-12-20 10:21:33] <%+JinXv> i see supports using tier 2 gems at clown/brel KEKW
[2022-12-20 10:21:33] <+Henryjaw> yea dude
[2022-12-20 10:21:41] <zel777> only thing that was pricey for my bard was class engraving, ...240k gold for 20, but everything else was cheap
[2022-12-20 10:21:43] <+okkkken> getting into brel with 3x3 and legendary acc : )
[2022-12-20 10:21:50] <%TobisawaMisaki> true

[2022-12-20 10:22:03] <%+the_pikahu> yeah i wish there was more effective support progression
[2022-12-20 10:22:05] <+Henryjaw> im going to make more paladins
[2022-12-20 10:22:20] <+galadrielkenobi> I recently got 4x3+1 on my bard. feels nice
[2022-12-20 10:22:32] <+srbotero> For me its boring i like seeing power
[2022-12-20 10:22:41] <ikigami_ikigai> yeah Smoge
[2022-12-20 10:22:41] <%duboo777> its boring, but I made one for my static so we can rotate supports
[2022-12-20 10:22:42] <+srbotero> Thats why i have 0 supports in 14 characters
[2022-12-20 10:22:45] <zel777> Ngl i just do latest content clear with Bard, after progging that i go clear on dps and have a much easier time
[2022-12-20 10:22:46] <kokomqfka> just die harder LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-20 10:22:47] <%+Ryougui> i enjoy my blue gl and my supports
[2022-12-20 10:22:48] <+AntipainK> I wanted to make Paladin as my 2nd support, but I hate his gameplay and I don't want to have duplicate classes
[2022-12-20 10:22:54] <ExGh0ost> but thats our role tho Sadge
[2022-12-20 10:23:05] <%+JinXv> i guess pally dps buff gets higher the higher the weapon?
[2022-12-20 10:23:09] <+lagnumber> Yeah, you only hone for ilvl to play in higher raids for supp

[2022-12-20 10:23:40] <zel777> @duboo777 did that with my static too, easy supps for 3 kukus a week, only have to get 1 dps from pug each time
[2022-12-20 10:23:51] <@%+Shikiro> @its_dominec i got my 4x3 set up on my bard for under 50k gold. i think that's cheap
[2022-12-20 10:24:04] <@%+Shikiro> full relic accessories
[2022-12-20 10:24:08] <Cylozs> my mates always say they have the biggest numbers with my pala so its fun for me
[2022-12-20 10:24:11] <kokomqfka> @jinxv i am with paly and at 1490 and with dps build it is hard to do trhon ...
[2022-12-20 10:24:15] <+deusnoctis1985> hey ATK , does chaos gate 1520 rewards differ a lot from 1490 ?
[2022-12-20 10:24:21] <+hermiowne> @deusnoctis1985 not that different
[2022-12-20 10:24:24] <+hermiowne> more shards tho
[2022-12-20 10:24:25] <Nevan56> they should make avery class dps and every class with supp abilities, and importat is make partys with diferens classes that provide diferent supp sinergies
[2022-12-20 10:24:27] <its_dominec> @Shikiro try 5x3 its so expn
[2022-12-20 10:24:33] <Thaemine> the issue is also  there are only 3  visually distinct supports... in game like WoW or LoL people play support just because the character looks cool to them even though they would probably prefer DPS role more
[2022-12-20 10:24:44] <%duboo777> @duboo777 yeah, no stress every week to find supports haha
[2022-12-20 10:24:48] <Cylozs> @Nevan56 gl balancing that
[2022-12-20 10:24:55] <DevilishDeva> I have fun playing with good supports that coordinate buffs... but most supports just seem to be chip damage avoidance
[2022-12-20 10:25:07] <%+the_pikahu> In LoL there are "supports" that deal more damage than carries haha
[2022-12-20 10:25:10] <+deusnoctis1985> @hermiowne shards are good :)
[2022-12-20 10:25:11] <+mynamepandu> wait, whats happening to support? Support main here. do i need to change classes or smth?

[2022-12-20 10:25:19] <Nevan56> bns have every class dps and works
[2022-12-20 10:25:26] <evenchuly> Old fistweaver in WoW was like that
[2022-12-20 10:25:32] <+hermiowne> deusnoctis1985 yeah and if you think about it, youre gonna farm that 1520 for 3 months, so it adds up
[2022-12-20 10:25:32] <+Henryjaw> like in ffxiv
[2022-12-20 10:25:33] <+AntipainK> dps bard with proper engravings actually does a decent amount of dps
[2022-12-20 10:25:44] <+Alleaera> Would 80% dps be too much for a support though?
[2022-12-20 10:25:47] <zel777> apparently ff14 has a sage class that does dmg but also supports
[2022-12-20 10:25:47] <%+dreweezyy> @mynamepandu no, play more supports atkOk
[2022-12-20 10:25:54] <+Lundi15> thats why I like GL cause I can give some shields but aslso dps
[2022-12-20 10:26:02] <+Noxianne> Like in ff xiv, you can do solo things easy with the healers class
[2022-12-20 10:26:02] <Runtrains> stoopzz said it last night, a disc priest support style would be nice
[2022-12-20 10:26:08] <+Henryjaw> healer deal like 30-40% of dps’s damage output
[2022-12-20 10:26:20] <+Noxianne> @runtrains yeah please that’s my Favourite class
[2022-12-20 10:26:25] <+hermiowne> @Runtrains he streamed last night?
[2022-12-20 10:26:35] <%+the_pikahu> he was on saint's stream
[2022-12-20 10:26:40] <+hermiowne> ah fair
[2022-12-20 10:26:43] <+galadrielkenobi> for me if Im support I don't wanna dps
[2022-12-20 10:26:47] <Runtrains> @hermiowne he was just in call doing akkan with the boiz
[2022-12-20 10:26:50] <+mynamepandu> @dreweezyy ok, i just hyper express another paladin, dont tell me i wasted it, if not sadge
[2022-12-20 10:26:53] <+Alleaera> @Noxianne That's one of the major upsides with FF14 healers tbh, we feel like we can still do something if there's no healing needed.
[2022-12-20 10:27:17] <+galadrielkenobi> sainSip

[2022-12-20 10:27:28] <@%+Shikiro> I just looked I can get a 5x3 set up with about 200-250k gold which isn't that bad
[2022-12-20 10:27:28] <+mrbrigthsid3> people saying supports are boring are the worst. they don't try to use damage reduction skills in time, they don't counter, they don't try to buff parties during damage windows. support is only boring if you're making it to be. try being better
[2022-12-20 10:27:28] <!%LustKR> they should make yearning less op
[2022-12-20 10:27:31] <ikigami_ikigai> supps are vital
[2022-12-20 10:27:33] <raivorino> make every class can shield and heal ok

[2022-12-20 10:27:46] <HBShock> They just need to incentivize playing a support. How they do that, I dunno.
[2022-12-20 10:27:46] <zel777> but yearning nerf would be a nerf to every class?
[2022-12-20 10:27:50] <+Henryjaw> even in wow, in highest diffculty content, healers are expected to deal damage too

[2022-12-20 10:30:39] <%+the_pikahu> but you can have a dps player convert to yearning

[2022-12-20 10:31:00] <zel777> latest content support is fun, but any old overgeared hw content as supp is watching other people have fun

[2022-12-20 12:02:24] <6151512> no
[2022-12-20 12:02:52] <+LilZombieBoy> How is paladin not the best support since he doesnt need people to stand in a puddle for dmg at all?
[2022-12-20 12:03:16] <inst1nctCS> his heals are worse
[2022-12-20 12:03:25] <6151512> @LilZombieBoy he is in hell modes OpieOP
[2022-12-20 12:03:32] <+Slyarliss> 13k heals every 30 seconds is bad ?
[2022-12-20 12:03:33] <+Slyarliss> wtf
[2022-12-20 12:03:34] <inst1nctCS> So id rather take a bard to prog runs not palas

[2022-12-20 12:04:01] <inst1nctCS> good bard has 1 bar heal in the same time and it is 50k
[2022-12-20 12:04:08] <Seanthedemiurge> Paladin >bard
[2022-12-20 12:04:11] <+Slyarliss> and that heal happens every 5 minutes
[2022-12-20 12:04:17] <6151512> paladin is waaaay better for prog
[2022-12-20 12:04:23] <+Slyarliss> sorry i rather have 13k evey 30 seconds than 50k every 3 minutes
[2022-12-20 12:04:30] <inst1nctCS> huh
[2022-12-20 12:04:40] <inst1nctCS> do you actually play a bard and know how long it takes to fill one bar xD
[2022-12-20 12:04:41] <koyanskayar> dps artist
[2022-12-20 12:04:46] <inst1nctCS> It is max 1 min
[2022-12-20 12:04:46] <Seanthedemiurge> especially dps paladin Kappa
[2022-12-20 12:04:48] <inst1nctCS> if you are bad
[2022-12-20 12:04:51] <+Slyarliss> its not 1 min
[2022-12-20 12:04:52] <+Slyarliss> LMFASO
[2022-12-20 12:05:02] <+Slyarliss> i seen bards they take 3-5 mins per heal
[2022-12-20 12:05:07] <Raeinor> y'all debating which support is better as if you get to choose when a 3x3 andy with no hands applies to your party and you accept him anyway Chatting
[2022-12-20 12:05:08] <+Slyarliss> hence they call it out when heal is dropping
[2022-12-20 12:05:10] <%yoohyeonisn> peepoBox
[2022-12-20 12:05:10] <+MisterGreatness> Bard shields have higher uptime than paladin, and her heals are much faster than 3 mins
[2022-12-20 12:05:11] <inst1nctCS> then they are bad
[2022-12-20 12:05:16] <+hoefrog> HUH

[2022-12-20 12:06:11] <ItsMeTZh> I prefer A support, but there's none Sadge
[2022-12-20 12:06:11] <+Slyarliss> regardless brel showed us how bad our support situation is
[2022-12-20 12:06:21] <+Gafiam> Bards can give damage buffs when party don't need heals, unlike Paladin, Paladin always heal independently of what they can do besides that xD
[2022-12-20 12:06:28] <+LilZombieBoy> oof.  Was it bad?  Im not high enough ilvl yet

[2022-12-20 12:07:52] <Seanthedemiurge> yeah i only have one support i play and its a paladin
[2022-12-20 12:07:53] <+LilZombieBoy> If there where 6 different supports id probably play 4 or 6

[2022-12-20 12:08:22] <+Gafiam> @ExGh0ost I believe the cheapest to do this week is 1 piece to +21 and rush the item you upgrade to brel gear, but the chapest one for real is to wait for a second piece to upgrade to brel gear
[2022-12-20 12:08:24] <Seanthedemiurge> u get instantly accepted when u play dps ur competing with every other dps
[2022-12-20 12:08:26] <+Valk543> I feel like sups dont even get inspected

[2022-12-20 12:08:51] <+LilZombieBoy> Artist chaos clear is better than bard right?  Bard chaos is the only reason I haven't made one on my new region
[2022-12-20 12:08:51] <+Slyarliss> its actualy easy way to homework with a suport

[2022-12-20 15:01:03] <+mattyydubzz> tower was fun the first time lol
[2022-12-20 15:01:08] <+akujousarasimp> tower needs to disappear
[2022-12-20 15:01:10] <SilkyThokks> i have to grind tower cause people hating on my low roster level
[2022-12-20 15:01:11] <+osbertooo> its cool until you die
[2022-12-20 15:01:14] <Savage_hr> I only like Tower once I'm vastly overgeared for it LOL
[2022-12-20 15:01:18] <%+Mistressapocalypse> did it once and never again
[2022-12-20 15:01:18] <Snaizzz> but after the 3rd char tower i just MrDestructoid
[2022-12-20 15:01:19] <jojoh70> i think t1 tower was fun for first time but the other towers are just annoying and too much imo
[2022-12-20 15:01:20] <+leandrolplp> is there a reason to do tower more than once? wtf
[2022-12-20 15:01:21] <+akujousarasimp> it's the bane of any lost ark player
[2022-12-20 15:01:28] <mothoncrack> stagger is worse
[2022-12-20 15:01:28] <Asmii> stagger worse
[2022-12-20 15:01:37] <Dessari> tower is solo
[2022-12-20 15:01:39] <QuentoD3> still tower YEP
[2022-12-20 15:01:39] <%Skarmory95> tower worse if you are bard

[2022-12-20 15:01:43] <+akujousarasimp> there's like 150 stages of tower
[2022-12-20 15:01:44] <sunnyowoo> clearing t2 tower while u were t2 is actually nightmare
[2022-12-20 15:01:44] <+MeruCL> One is ur fault, the second one is all fault
[2022-12-20 15:01:45] <Asmii> tower is your own mistake
[2022-12-20 15:01:48] <+akujousarasimp> it's pure hell
[2022-12-20 15:01:57] <Sinkersos> In tower you might be underpowered
[2022-12-20 15:02:00] <+FatalStrats> the stagger isn;t solely your fault, but you feel worse because tower is just you
[2022-12-20 15:02:02] <DIRTSPITTER> group stagger
[2022-12-20 15:02:06] <NukeMastah> im clueless, only hv 2 g1-g4 and 3 g1-g2 chars
[2022-12-20 15:02:06] <%pietastypie> tower is the game's mistake

[2022-12-20 15:03:57] <%+raxiyeen> @Nubzaru this guy doesnt know much, early on most of the damage comes from charming set, only swap to other sets after you have good tripods and gems

[2022-12-20 15:04:03] <%+Nalysea> Or cheat orbs with wei or one person baits the orbs and you don't use wei.

[2022-12-20 15:07:11] <+boilermakker> the problem with these is that you are thinking of them all when you're like 1600. think about people messing up valtan when he was new and you were 1445 no relic gear
