[2023-01-03 00:37:57] <%JurgenRapp> damn DSR is brutal
[2023-01-03 00:52:34] <%drzaius30> Zepla is breaking LUL
[2023-01-03 01:02:39] <%JurgenRapp> she is
[2023-01-03 01:03:56] <%JurgenRapp> but that's just how it is, but doing something so hard for 8 hours
[2023-01-03 01:04:19] <%JurgenRapp> wouldn't it be better to do like 3h 2h break and 2h again
[2023-01-03 01:04:19] <%drzaius30> everyday for a week LUL
[2023-01-03 01:04:52] <%drzaius30> the mechanics need to be beaten into you
[2023-01-03 01:04:59] <%drzaius30> its really the only way
[2023-01-03 01:05:18] <%JurgenRapp> yeah but sometimes the brain needs some time to do the programming?
[2023-01-03 01:05:38] <%JurgenRapp> a rest day to let all the information sink in
[2023-01-03 01:06:02] <%JurgenRapp> but they probably know what they are doing :)
[2023-01-03 01:06:21] <%drzaius30> Also trying to get it done before 6.3
[2023-01-03 01:06:38] <%JurgenRapp> yeah and some of the other people most get back to work
[2023-01-03 01:06:49] <%JurgenRapp> so that was the big thing I think
[2023-01-03 01:06:50] <%drzaius30> she has a week zeplaQblank
[2023-01-03 01:07:23] <%JurgenRapp> They are pretty close so they should be able to do it I take it
[2023-01-03 01:07:23] <%drzaius30> zeplaQsleep
[2023-01-03 01:08:09] <%JurgenRapp> Oh no i was getting food, will they continue tomorrow
[2023-01-03 01:08:10] <%drzaius30> Final phase is a victory lap according to everyone is cleared
[2023-01-03 01:08:20] <%drzaius30> who has *
[2023-01-03 01:08:38] <%drzaius30> @JurgenRapp Ye
[2023-01-03 01:08:41] <%JurgenRapp> yeah they *should* be able to do it then
[2023-01-03 01:09:50] <%JurgenRapp> It is good content, it's like the mage towers, but I guess it's not for everyone
[2023-01-03 01:10:10] <%JurgenRapp> to see someone doing the same thing over and over :D
[2023-01-03 01:11:18] <%drzaius30> DSR was a bit different to most raids in terms of viewership
[2023-01-03 01:11:39] <drzaius30> they usually have high viewership initially
[2023-01-03 01:12:01] <%drzaius30> DSR stayed high the whole time cause the story stuff
[2023-01-03 01:12:45] <%drzaius30> alternate timeline Heavensward was pretty hype
[2023-01-03 01:14:40] <%JurgenRapp> Yeah I don't know anything about the story, I just like see how they figure things out and make progress.
[2023-01-03 01:16:34] <%JurgenRapp> That something that day one looks impossible is just a little roadbump on day 3
[2023-01-03 01:18:31] <%JurgenRapp> but yeah peepoSleep

[2023-01-03 01:23:22] <~%AnnieFuchsia> if anyone else needs maruuk rep Im in a raid farming hunts, found them in LFG
[2023-01-03 01:27:00] <%Collnaris> i might later, what is their name in LFG?
[2023-01-03 01:27:55] <~%AnnieFuchsia> Grand Hunt 24/7
[2023-01-03 01:32:27] <%OJ_Hype> did a bit of that earlier
[2023-01-03 01:32:38] <%OJ_Hype> gets draining fast though
[2023-01-03 01:32:58] <%+Chryterion> You can sit afk while doing those?
[2023-01-03 01:33:12] <%OJ_Hype> they kick afkers usually
[2023-01-03 01:33:19] <%OJ_Hype> at least the group i was in
[2023-01-03 01:33:45] <%+Chryterion> What's the benefit then, getting tags on the rares in WM?
[2023-01-03 01:34:11] <%PneumaWHU> More people = stages finish faster
[2023-01-03 01:34:15] <%PneumaWHU> So more hunts done
[2023-01-03 01:34:22] <%+Chryterion> Yeah
[2023-01-03 01:34:47] <%Collnaris> is the group wm on or off?
[2023-01-03 01:35:04] <%+Chryterion> WM on I guess?
[2023-01-03 01:40:24] <%+Chryterion> It's wm off btw

[2023-01-03 13:54:34] <%JurgenRapp> well you never know when it's gonna start storming again so better to just stay in cover
[2023-01-03 13:55:01] <%JurgenRapp> clever  catPeek
[2023-01-03 13:56:17] <@%Mongbat25> I never watch the news so technically she does know the weather better than me LUL
[2023-01-03 13:59:39] <%JurgenRapp> didn't you have a massive winter storm, perhaps more on the way
[2023-01-03 14:02:16] <@%Mongbat25> hm yea phone says that was a 60% chance and there is a 98% chance in 3-4 hours Hmmm
[2023-01-03 14:03:06] <%JurgenRapp> Flash Flood Warning and tornado watch, you guys have crazy weather
[2023-01-03 14:04:12] <%JurgenRapp> I just looked at some random warnings at (https://www.weather.gov/)
[2023-01-03 14:05:03] <@%Mongbat25> !weather Ashland City
[2023-01-03 14:05:03] <@%^Nightbot> Weather for Ashland City: Conditions are Cloudy with a temperature of 66F (19C). The wind is blowing from the SSW at 11mph (18km/h) and the current humidity is 89%.
[2023-01-03 14:10:05] <%JurgenRapp> what does TORNADO WATCH mean?
[2023-01-03 14:10:12] <%JurgenRapp> it sounds kinda bad
[2023-01-03 14:10:30] <%JurgenRapp> we don't have that in sweden
[2023-01-03 14:11:26] <%JurgenRapp> I think the cat is doing the right thing
[2023-01-03 14:13:05] <@%Mongbat25> A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form. so good to be alert vs a tornado watch one has already been spotted in said areas I think
[2023-01-03 14:13:16] <@%Mongbat25> vs a warning i meant
[2023-01-03 14:17:55] <%JurgenRapp> Clearly the cat knows EXTENDED TORNADO WATCH 6 UNTIL 11 AM CST THIS MORNING IN NASHVILLE.

[2023-01-03 15:35:52] <%PanicRush> you can, as long as you arent using embelishments on everything

[2023-01-03 15:43:31] <%Makkan780> that mount is something you should buy from a rep vendor for 5k gold

[2023-01-03 15:44:10] <%Bitfrost9> the mount does look cool imo. it just doesn't look good as a M+ equivalent to the dragon gladiator gets.
[2023-01-03 15:44:13] <Jpreme4> Raiders get rasz skin, pvpers get highland glad skin and viscous, ksm get blue turd :)

[2023-01-03 15:45:52] <%Turbopumper> would be cool if they gave dragon customizations instead, like the raid and pvp ones

[2023-01-03 16:05:04] <%+achoourn> Do you think a decent amount of players will receive the heartbreaker rocket on love is in the air?
[2023-01-03 16:05:13] <%Taylor131313> how did you get locked 4 times in 15 seconds pepeWTF what the shit
[2023-01-03 16:05:14] <%bYTEfROG> @deango99 you have two frames on top of the nameplate, frame 1 and 2, that can have different sizes plus a "buff special" on the right side. there may be an option to make one aura larger with mods

[2023-01-03 16:37:07] <TheLemenHead> @majster_cygan isn't that how long queues are? lol. Leavers punishment should be like mobas where if you leave a certain number you have to go through probation matches
[2023-01-03 16:37:09] <%Turbopumper> so it's better to lose rating than mmr? monkaHmm

[2023-01-03 16:38:32] <%Collnaris> @Taylor131313 it should penalize more than solo shuffle imo
[2023-01-03 16:38:38] <%Morgonbladet> with higher mmr than CR you can play 3-3 and gain rating but if they are the same you gain 0

[2023-01-03 17:06:18] <%Taylor131313> getting some proper pulls on heroic razsageth this week would be cool
[2023-01-03 17:06:21] <%Mirkooo> I assume most people still need tier pieces tho
[2023-01-03 17:06:24] <%epicpockettroll> brood is rough

[2023-01-03 17:07:26] <%Sne4ky79> last heroic went quite smooth though @Taylor131313 but brood looks quite rough
[2023-01-03 17:07:52] <%Taylor131313> the problem with brood is that tanks need to learn the pathing
[2023-01-03 17:07:54] <%Bloodmatch> brood can be rough but once a path is formed and group are made for adds just a matter of repeat remember
[2023-01-03 17:07:58] <%OJ_Hype> do you get dragonscale rep from these?
[2023-01-03 17:08:16] <+Reimore> use dragon quest too clear hands ^^

[2023-01-03 17:09:33] <%Sne4ky79> @Bloodmatch i remember you all talked about the pathing on brood
[2023-01-03 17:10:07] <%Bloodmatch> hc brood has more eggs

[2023-01-03 17:26:49] <Rolaz> what penalty in LoL for leaving soloq? i think its quite harsh if you leave too many games
[2023-01-03 17:26:56] VIEWERS: 986
[2023-01-03 17:26:57] <%Makkan780> they should lose like 2x the rating as if they lost every game
[2023-01-03 17:27:03] <%Collnaris> i'd type to them a strongly worded letter
[2023-01-03 17:27:05] <%leftylafter> Did I even say Hi
[2023-01-03 17:27:06] <%Sne4ky79> i would feel so tilted after ppl leave after so many matches
[2023-01-03 17:27:12] <TheLemenHead> @Rolaz Thats what I was thinking too - I never wanted to leave LoL games

[2023-01-03 17:27:47] <%Taylor131313> if you lose rating and your MMR is still high, you're gonna win the points you lost if you win next game

[2023-01-03 17:28:45] <%Makkan780> could also have a stacking penalty for requeue liek 1day 1week 1 months
[2023-01-03 17:28:51] <%Taylor131313> Annie they should change it so you lose only MMR if you leave, enjoy getting +1 points for the next 10 wins GIGACHAD

[2023-01-03 17:30:31] <%PanicRush> thats how it is in league with leaving or dodging queue
[2023-01-03 17:30:32] <%Collnaris> they should be able to check the games though
