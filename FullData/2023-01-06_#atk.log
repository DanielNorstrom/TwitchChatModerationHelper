[2023-01-06 05:47:17] <+PenndragonPrime> it brought up more questions
[2023-01-06 05:47:24] <ShayZenDraq> @Kaizeo_ rave was before fairy tail
[2023-01-06 05:47:32] <%+Kaizeo_> ShayZenDraq yes i know
[2023-01-06 05:47:49] <%+Kaizeo_> im asking if fairy tail was out while rave was ongoing
[2023-01-06 05:48:04] <%+Kaizeo_> cuz im assuming he rushed rave ending cuz fairy tail was more popular, hence the abrupt ending
[2023-01-06 05:48:10] <ShayZenDraq> @Kaizeo_ no it wasnt. fairy started 2006. rave ended in 2005 (manga)

[2023-01-06 07:02:47] <+shoraaaa> honestly if they only changed shield shock to steal counter from bash and increased the range tripod to make it usable i would have been happy, using that skill over the red one would have been decent dps increase
[2023-01-06 07:02:47] <BobTheBlobFishLive> you didnt have barricade on :O
[2023-01-06 07:02:52] <ZetYokai> go crit and hallucination for memes

[2023-01-06 07:03:44] <%ArcadeAndro> i think you can protect certin boss mech maybe
[2023-01-06 07:03:47] <%Fallen_Oni> I cant imagine a point of the raid using that X to do dmg
[2023-01-06 07:03:52] <+S5un> No shields again
[2023-01-06 07:03:57] <torms17> maybe just to encourage GL players to actually use X @ATK
[2023-01-06 07:03:57] <OneAutumnLeaf68> 55 Pog
[2023-01-06 07:04:01] <+geityy> actually not bad
[2023-01-06 07:04:05] <+Willhaus> maybe to offset your non dps time while u do X
[2023-01-06 07:04:08] <garrands_> it refunds gauges when you block damage
[2023-01-06 07:04:10] <+boladragao> idk its worth to change the shield
[2023-01-06 07:04:18] <+geityy> can you add rune to X skill?
[2023-01-06 07:04:18] <%TreysoonTV> i guess its for save the mates and the dmg comes after dont cancle it
[2023-01-06 07:04:18] <%+the_pikahu> yeah you def don't shout first
[2023-01-06 07:04:18] <Parad1gm___> Im so happy damage luck isn't completely random
[2023-01-06 07:04:24] <+hpp3> can you just x as soon as you are at 20%
[2023-01-06 07:04:24] <%TreysoonTV> its only an extra
[2023-01-06 07:04:25] <+shoraaaa> @Fallen_Oni valtan triple spear move maybe lol if someone couldnt get into the safe zone fast enough
[2023-01-06 07:04:25] <torms17> not worth the gem slot IMO coz of long cooldown
[2023-01-06 07:04:25] <Gaucherie> save your squishy friends
[2023-01-06 07:04:26] <HiroTachii> 55 mill and 30% extra if you protect poeple

[2023-01-06 07:04:31] <+ronn13who> use surge cannon with blue gunalncer?
[2023-01-06 07:04:32] <Jambeeast> might be for pep
[2023-01-06 07:04:33] <+shoraaaa> it seems rather useless
[2023-01-06 07:04:34] <Jambeeast> pvp
[2023-01-06 07:04:37] <AhhRan> so its like counter gunlance for blue that does damage?
[2023-01-06 07:04:41] <+Mars__Jupiter> i think in a real raid u basically guaranteed to get a bit back at least
[2023-01-06 07:04:42] <@%+Shikiro> maybe it's a lot better if you save peeps
[2023-01-06 07:04:42] <kasaiseigyo> i think they add it for a counter mech maybe in the future
[2023-01-06 07:04:43] <xxnekrozxx> maybe when people run away and you need to catch up
[2023-01-06 07:04:43] <sta1os> its utility first
[2023-01-06 07:04:47] <HoopsBlazing> Guy did he go over red lancer yet?
[2023-01-06 07:04:48] <sta1os> damage second
[2023-01-06 07:04:49] <%+genogar> counter gunlance/rhapsody
[2023-01-06 07:04:50] <HoopsBlazing> Or just blue so far
[2023-01-06 07:04:57] <@%+Shikiro> Red is just Number gains
[2023-01-06 07:05:03] <+cl0wndown> Maybe with lvl 3 class it does more
[2023-01-06 07:05:04] <+ronn13who> can u try surge cannon with spec build?
[2023-01-06 07:05:06] <garrands_> so blue got an extra skill
[2023-01-06 07:05:10] <+Retrac752> red skills got animation updates
[2023-01-06 07:05:10] <%ArcadeAndro> its does a lot of dmg though maybe worth to try in raids
[2023-01-06 07:05:12] <+smellyivan> did he already test red?
[2023-01-06 07:05:12] <torms17> @Jambeeast this makes more sense. Prep for Rowen POGCRAZY

[2023-01-06 07:12:21] <%+the_pikahu> maybe i should go to red, I don't think I ever used the x skill in my life

[2023-01-06 07:14:39] <0xMiguelx0> you can play swift halluc. Actually pretty good
[2023-01-06 07:14:55] <+hpp3> you just cast lightning before bash
[2023-01-06 07:15:08] <+shoraaaa> bash shield bash thunderoblt leap attack
[2023-01-06 07:15:10] <%+genogar> blue's identity can let hell parties push dps through boss attacks maybe
[2023-01-06 07:15:10] <+phillipfrompayroll> if quick prep bash -> leap -> gt -> shield bash
[2023-01-06 07:15:10] <sta1os> mash skills in bash window
[2023-01-06 07:15:14] <xeap> that wont make up 5m ds chat OMEGALUL

[2023-01-06 07:15:15] <sta1os> rinse repeat
[2023-01-06 07:15:16] <%+the_pikahu> maybe you go quick prep on leap, and go bash -> shield bash -> leap -> tb -> auto -> bash -> shield bash -> leap -> shield charnge -> repeat
[2023-01-06 07:15:17] <zDoremon> at least you can fit all skills in bash window now
[2023-01-06 07:15:24] <+shoraaaa> if you have cd reduction tripod on leap you cant get it back aon chaarge
[2023-01-06 07:15:26] <Tkova> I can fit Shield Charge, Lightning and Leap into a bash
[2023-01-06 07:15:27] <+Mav_OnAir> what if u change Stats in 1500 spec and 800+ crit ?
[2023-01-06 07:15:27] <Tkova> BEFORE

[2023-01-06 07:15:35] <+hpp3> imo rotation doesn't really matter as long as lightning and charge are always in bash
[2023-01-06 07:15:40] <%TreysoonTV> do you have armor break tripod on shieldbash?
[2023-01-06 07:15:43] <ZetYokai> @Mav_OnAir spec scaling too big

[2023-01-06 07:15:59] <andredablio> shout gives more damage to skills without head attack now tho, you can use taunt and bash
[2023-01-06 07:16:08] <Aznlox> you're missing 12% from combat readiness engraving
[2023-01-06 07:16:20] <waadejr> true blue gl suck

[2023-01-06 07:16:33] <%+the_pikahu> yeah i think they really needed to change CR engraving too

[2023-01-06 07:16:41] <+LILBEEFY> U missing  stab stat
[2023-01-06 07:16:44] <xeap> just play blue with destruction set, does no dmg either way  KEKL
[2023-01-06 07:16:47] <Makavelit0t0> @ATK you forget 1 thing, blue gunlancer does more dmg the longer the fight goes. and im blue, i think it still strong
[2023-01-06 07:16:50] <Synergyxox> you are simming 100% head attack in trixion and saying blue is bad :clown:
[2023-01-06 07:16:51] <+shoraaaa> the only time i see x skill being useful is valtans triple anchor attack when ppl cant get into that safe zone, utterly useless
[2023-01-06 07:16:51] <%+genogar> i think x skill might have uses in hell mode to push dps for the party
[2023-01-06 07:16:52] <MangoMosh> did they change gunlancer animations?
[2023-01-06 07:16:55] <%+dreweezyy> play what you like atkNoted
[2023-01-06 07:16:57] <Kuujoe36> is bash still the same, must hit enemy to active it the buff?
[2023-01-06 07:17:04] <+hpp3> I think they expect blue GL to actually use X now
[2023-01-06 07:17:10] <alexkai20> Blue is for new raid and red is for when you have moreexperiance on raid
[2023-01-06 07:17:14] <+hpp3> like they want blue GL to be more supportive
[2023-01-06 07:17:14] <torms17> has he showcased red? I got here kinda late
[2023-01-06 07:17:16] <@%+Shikiro> @Kuujoe36 no it's on hitting the skill now don't have to hit enemy
[2023-01-06 07:17:23] <+Trazynt> did you tested red with full swift crit
[2023-01-06 07:17:24] <Tkova> That doesn't synergise either way
[2023-01-06 07:17:38] <%TreysoonTV> yeah they only changed red
[2023-01-06 07:17:41] <%TreysoonTV> thats true
[2023-01-06 07:17:42] <Tkova> That's like 90% HM only
[2023-01-06 07:17:42] <+flame_lz> Blue didn't lose any synergy, only positional skill in Blue GL is shield bash
[2023-01-06 07:17:51] <+flame_lz> They gain 1% damage
[2023-01-06 07:17:58] <Lundaris> LET EM KNOW
[2023-01-06 07:18:01] <+phillipfrompayroll> guardian thunderbolt got 2 lines of tripods buffed
[2023-01-06 07:18:03] <+phillipfrompayroll> not 1 though
[2023-01-06 07:18:04] <Synergyxox> you sim 100% head attack and say blue is worse than red, actually cooked
[2023-01-06 07:18:09] <Lundaris> like how are they telling a kr vet who plays GL like the fuck
[2023-01-06 07:18:11] <+hpp3> they want you to save people with X skill
[2023-01-06 07:18:15] <+Justri24> xdd
[2023-01-06 07:18:15] <Aznlox> blue gained 1% from shout synergy lmao

[2023-01-06 07:19:02] <%TreysoonTV> blue gl still worst dps thats true KEKW
[2023-01-06 07:19:02] <+hpp3> the new X might actually be really good now
[2023-01-06 07:19:05] <zDoremon> only change that is kinda big is guardian thunderbolt tripod
[2023-01-06 07:19:05] <khaled_k_> lancer Is better now
[2023-01-06 07:19:05] <Tkova> it's more of a fill skill considering the cooldown is so long

[2023-01-06 07:20:43] <ZetYokai> the dot on leap looks big
[2023-01-06 07:20:44] <Nigerianbucket> That thing misses so much
[2023-01-06 07:20:51] <sekkysekky> how long was the X cooldown to use again?
[2023-01-06 07:20:57] <sta1os> blue is even more comfortable now
[2023-01-06 07:20:57] <+phillipfrompayroll> smilegate killed the back attack synergy comps though which is the best thing

[2023-01-06 07:23:17] <Bu1baa> @ATK I'm just curious on about support shortage. If people know about the support shortage and everyone wants a support in their party, why does everyone jack up the support engravings + accs? Wouldn't this further discourage making support characters?
[2023-01-06 07:23:17] <+rensgambit> this blue GL main is holding up our review ;(

[2023-01-06 07:26:39] <Show_nl> ya but how much of the dps pie did u gain ?
[2023-01-06 07:26:42] <khaled_k_> ptr will come to EU NA soon?
[2023-01-06 07:26:45] <Goraato> Gunlancer is MORE THAN DAMAGE!
[2023-01-06 07:26:50] <sta1os> in mandatory skills
[2023-01-06 07:26:53] <%+the_pikahu> it's a buff but it's not enough

[2023-01-06 07:27:00] <+Imbaslap> the only win is gunlancers give hitmaster class 1% more dmg synergy lol
[2023-01-06 07:27:02] <+racc_i_am> Can you clarify the changes to Gunlancer awakening? Google translate didn't make sense
[2023-01-06 07:27:12] <sta1os> KEKL
[2023-01-06 07:27:13] <dualchineseblade> monkaW
[2023-01-06 07:27:17] <%TekuMehku> I do 1% more dmg now Smadge
[2023-01-06 07:27:18] <%ArcadeAndro> @Imbaslap true
[2023-01-06 07:27:18] <+MintLucidify> would be like wrestling in the mud
[2023-01-06 07:27:18] <dualchineseblade> peepoBlush I play gl
[2023-01-06 07:27:19] <+S5un> As a blue main, I’ll just be happy with the damage buff. No blue would ever argue that they do more than red.
[2023-01-06 07:27:28] <+S5un> We’re just high uptime damage and utility
[2023-01-06 07:27:29] <Bu1baa> But yeah, if people want to charge an arm and leg for support, why complain? It feels like they're shooting themselves in the foot
[2023-01-06 07:27:31] <NathanWearsPants> nothing about gameplay was changed and it sucks
[2023-01-06 07:27:31] <%TreysoonTV> do your stagger do the counter get mvp with 10% dmg KEKW
[2023-01-06 07:27:32] <Tkova> I mean 9% synergy and 12% armor reduction
[2023-01-06 07:27:39] <+TheRoaringGun> there a link to this update?
[2023-01-06 07:27:41] <Tkova> still pretty sick
[2023-01-06 07:27:44] <+Mars__Jupiter> shield charge not head from prev balance
[2023-01-06 07:27:49] <+Khaswi> i don't know... i still think blue would due more damage... it's pure physics....
[2023-01-06 07:27:50] <+Babyfreezer23> but just like the bard damage but, its simply giving these support classes some more damage pie even if their main job is not damage
[2023-01-06 07:27:55] <Shyrshadi> !ptr
[2023-01-06 07:27:55] <+shoraaaa> honestly if they have the means to remove x skill on red lancer they should change shit around ofr blue to benefit it more
[2023-01-06 07:27:55] <@^StreamElements> https://lostark.game.onstove.com/News/TesterNotice/Views/24?page=1&searchtype=0&searchtext=
[2023-01-06 07:27:56] <+hpp3> I kinda just wish they would buff shield shock to be counter
[2023-01-06 07:28:01] <+lRedDog> 9% is now 5%
[2023-01-06 07:28:02] <Tkova> I mean if they made them both Head Attack that'd be sick af tbh
[2023-01-06 07:28:06] <+S5un> Better than a nerf or a negative rework
[2023-01-06 07:28:07] <%+genogar> i want to see the shield refund in action, but can't test it in trixion
[2023-01-06 07:28:08] <khaled_k_> just skip it and see gs geting buffs
[2023-01-06 07:28:09] <%ArcadeAndro> yea that 1% dmg increase is great for hitmasters
[2023-01-06 07:28:12] <ShayZenDraq> @Bu1baa first point: havin 5x3 on a support is just on you. you dont have to. all dd's HAVE TO have 5x3. you spending money on 5x3 and decided it for your own, all dd's are getting forced to. you complain about having to pay so much gold and you just dont have to. you want to.
[2023-01-06 07:28:23] <BladesNSpades> but the non positional dmg synergy got buffed (although just 1%) and head/back got nerfed
[2023-01-06 07:28:24] <+Imbaslap> i just want lvl 3 blue engraving be worth something
[2023-01-06 07:28:26] <ShayZenDraq> @Bu1baa second point: there is no second point. :3
[2023-01-06 07:28:28] <Goraato> Imagine Gunlancer with all his utilities and big damage. It wouldn’t be fair
[2023-01-06 07:28:30] <+TotalMadness_> @Tkova you'd have to change to entropy and I think mana would be an issue
[2023-01-06 07:28:33] <Alsum21> guage isnt an issue on blue tho
[2023-01-06 07:28:38] <+Retrac752> i think gl is a great class, its only weakness is damage is too low, now damage was buffed a bit, so im happy

[2023-01-06 07:28:44] <sta1os> Red has better utility because of swiftness
[2023-01-06 07:28:45] <Nigerianbucket> X skill gives meter back based on damage prevented?
[2023-01-06 07:28:45] <fiendartisanisqtaf> overall changes to GL tasted pretty bitter but I am an entropy enjoyer what can I say
[2023-01-06 07:28:51] <%+the_pikahu> i play blue cuz i need time to eat lunch :)
[2023-01-06 07:28:52] <Tkova> @Tkova Yea 100% we'd have to spam food
[2023-01-06 07:28:53] <%TreysoonTV> i have build blue and have blue tripods thats the reason for me why i dont play red
[2023-01-06 07:28:56] <%AyeJSuave> RIPBOZO
[2023-01-06 07:28:59] <+Imbaslap> TLDR, shield bash change is nice
[2023-01-06 07:28:59] <+racc_i_am> Can you clarify the changes to Gunlancer awakening?
[2023-01-06 07:29:00] <sta1os> but they are still relatively similar
[2023-01-06 07:29:02] <Tkova> I run out of mana in 1 rotation either way
[2023-01-06 07:29:05] <+GearBoxed> exp lancer nerfed smoge
[2023-01-06 07:29:05] <skyepsilon> sounds bout right
[2023-01-06 07:29:06] <Bu1baa> You say you don't need 5x3 on support bard. But when akkan comes rolling around. 5x3 becomes mandatory
[2023-01-06 07:29:06] <+Blazn_45> playing gunlance for dmg? just play hammer boy
[2023-01-06 07:29:08] <+Mav_OnAir> i mean u can pop X and instant get gauge back with shout or something
[2023-01-06 07:29:08] <Aznlox> too much entropy class in my roster already lmao
[2023-01-06 07:29:08] <+Justri24> u have to manage ur shield better in red so maybe that is a problem for them KEKW
[2023-01-06 07:29:08] <+bananadogenthusiast> gigachad red bussers rise
[2023-01-06 07:29:19] <Tkova> Red has more utility anyways O_o
[2023-01-06 07:29:20] <+pumqkins> WHEN I THINK OF GL I THINK OF SYNERGY N NOW ITS NERFED MY BACK ATTACK ROSTER WILL MISS U GL
[2023-01-06 07:29:22] <ZenithWho> @Bu1baa not rlly, thats just drops or vital
[2023-01-06 07:29:27] <+evenchuly> How many skills in red do you think you could get in one bash?
[2023-01-06 07:29:30] <+Imbaslap> and the ready attack tripod on bash applies not based on hit, but on skill activation
[2023-01-06 07:29:32] <Tkova> Has the same stagger with more weak point
[2023-01-06 07:29:36] <dualchineseblade> NOTED
[2023-01-06 07:29:36] <+Frgmnt> I think some people might just try to avoid red because they don't like the style of needing to use supercharge skills
[2023-01-06 07:29:36] <+Imbaslap> so if u pepega miss the boss u still get ready attack
[2023-01-06 07:29:43] <+cl0wndown> If the shield refills a lot based off dmg blocked it might be spammable in game making it a real dps skill @atk
[2023-01-06 07:29:45] <mrinvoker16> good damage buffs for gl... could be a little bit more % tho...
[2023-01-06 07:29:46] <SalemVendetta> sounds like Maokai's old ult
[2023-01-06 07:29:47] <sta1os> GIGACHAD
[2023-01-06 07:29:49] <Yasmarrr> can you test it with the boss attacking you?
[2023-01-06 07:29:49] <OnlyDoggiee> Workin on red tripods slowly so, probably swap with ancient
[2023-01-06 07:29:50] <torms17> Im just happy about the Bash QOL. Thats a huge W. I play both Blue and Red btw
[2023-01-06 07:29:53] <Shyrshadi> the meter return is nice too
[2023-01-06 07:29:55] <@%+Shikiro> @Bu1baa You only need 4x3 at endgame KEKW
[2023-01-06 07:29:55] <+TotalMadness_> @evenchuly you can add dash upperfire as a 3rd
[2023-01-06 07:29:56] <+shoraaaa> so can you test out the x skill dmg in prokel? maybe it will wrok in there
[2023-01-06 07:29:58] <%ArcadeAndro> i wanna see that 100m
[2023-01-06 07:29:59] <+Dovaz> but your not attacking during that defense
[2023-01-06 07:30:04] <+evenchuly> @evenchuly Nice!

[2023-01-06 07:30:21] <pluscutmoon> what was old maokai ult again?
[2023-01-06 07:30:28] <Tkova> X also doesnt' just gimp your dmg anymore
[2023-01-06 07:30:28] <+jtop_> as a blue, im not seeing ENOUGH to make me switch.
[2023-01-06 07:30:28] <Yasmarrr> can you show the x with the boss attacking you?
[2023-01-06 07:30:32] <+S5un> I hear you ATK, do you king.
[2023-01-06 07:30:36] <ZenithWho> @pluscutmoon it was like
[2023-01-06 07:30:37] <%+the_pikahu> ah red pill beats out blue pill again, ATK is the protagonist
[2023-01-06 07:30:38] <+Tetraxe> @pluscutmoon dmg reduction in circle, stores that reduced damage, and deals damage once you pop it
[2023-01-06 07:30:38] <ZenithWho> some circle thing
[2023-01-06 07:30:39] <+sirgreatsword> i got my 9/7 stone on blue so i cant go red
[2023-01-06 07:30:41] <+TotalMadness_> @pluscutmoon took reduced damage and dealt more damage the more damage he reduced

[2023-01-06 07:32:12] <+hpp3> I don't think it's as bad as you say. red > blue before patch, both got buffs, now red still > blue, but blue should still be dealing like 5-10% more than before patch

[2023-01-06 08:10:53] <%yoohyeonisn> oh yeah new skill
[2023-01-06 08:10:56] <Nanyiro> the problem now is that you cannot charge the hawk instantly, so to start they gave him a lot of critical damage to death strike
[2023-01-06 08:10:59] <+Imbaslap> not sure if you saw it but they buffed the basic attack dmg of the hawk by like 200%
[2023-01-06 08:11:18] <+Imbaslap> dunno if that helps LC
[2023-01-06 08:11:19] <+pumqkins> @Edwardt20 aracana imo hawkeye one of the most boring classes

[2023-01-06 08:18:55] <SolrSpark> @SalemVendetta one skill change... I'd say zerker is probably the most changed, but SS did well as well
[2023-01-06 08:19:00] <Dimby> Does that mean you can use more dps skills since the gauge skills you gain over time
[2023-01-06 08:19:05] <SalemVendetta> after rework arcana took a while for mains to figure it out

[2023-01-06 08:23:03] <+giahuy52> you can build gauge with bird out I think

[2023-01-06 08:23:17] <%DarkHobox> no

[2023-01-06 08:23:24] <%DarkHobox> both specs generate

[2023-01-06 08:36:01] <Finn_Gourmet> the playstyle is to stay the hawk up all the time
[2023-01-06 08:36:06] <Aznlox> also the new spec scaling, you have to keep the hawk out
[2023-01-06 08:36:08] <Shyrshadi> maybe use the skill, send the hawk, resummon hawk b4 using the skill?
[2023-01-06 08:36:12] <%DarkHobox> not just the tripod. spec now also scales damage while you have hawk out

[2023-01-06 08:57:52] <+Ghistriam> @luga227 they changed it too i think
[2023-01-06 08:57:52] <%kuro03011> So more dmg early in fight and do less for below 50%
[2023-01-06 08:57:52] <+Elyzabete> he said scouter not gs
[2023-01-06 08:57:56] <halk_boy> what did you do with the sharpshoter?
[2023-01-06 08:58:09] <pureeugene> straight up buff lol
[2023-01-06 08:58:10] <%wolder1305> NOTED
[2023-01-06 08:58:22] <+Sandman27> Its no longer 4 shots i think
[2023-01-06 08:58:25] <luga227> @luga227 3 shots in stead of 4 now, so QOL
[2023-01-06 08:58:26] <zercy03> i mean it just makes gs better for prog party
[2023-01-06 08:58:28] <+Sandman27> Its 3 shots with 2nd one applying the buff
[2023-01-06 08:58:32] <+Sandman27> But you lose a shot
[2023-01-06 08:58:46] <pureeugene> only -10% for other half of battle, but +45% for 1st half
[2023-01-06 08:58:51] <+nonax85> @Sandman27 the second shot was buffed to compensate
[2023-01-06 08:58:54] <pureeugene> straight up mathematically buffed
[2023-01-06 08:58:59] <RoseHoshy> so focus shot went from norm - norm - special - proc special (big dmg) to norm - special - norm - proc special (big dmg)?
[2023-01-06 08:59:04] <thenotsocoolkid> appreciate you checking on it ATK, thanks

[2023-01-06 08:59:46] <%wolder1305> how is it so far mr atk
[2023-01-06 08:59:47] <Adrian10198> was the sharpshooter a buff or a nerf? i am hard to understand
[2023-01-06 08:59:51] <RoseHoshy> @RoseHoshy wait it went down to 3 shot?
[2023-01-06 08:59:52] <+KHubes> yellow only not normal i mean
[2023-01-06 08:59:58] <RoseHoshy> pog crazy
[2023-01-06 09:00:01] <AdrianCa95> @pureeugene is 30 plus 45, so 75% overall
[2023-01-06 09:00:04] <pureeugene> @pureeugene sry i mean thats the other skill my bad

[2023-01-06 09:01:21] <+Imbaslap> having a dmg increase at the start of the fight is worth

[2023-01-06 09:01:52] <Kurenboi> yep
[2023-01-06 09:01:54] <Kurenboi> its phat now
[2023-01-06 09:01:57] <LawdGoons> only fires 2 now
[2023-01-06 09:01:57] <+Sandman27> Its correct
[2023-01-06 09:01:57] <+nonax85> 3 shots instead of 4 Pog
[2023-01-06 09:02:00] <Plurmorant> is it just shorter no O_O
[2023-01-06 09:02:02] <+XSteelblaze> is it even possible to test tripod of under 50% hp
[2023-01-06 09:02:03] <+Sandman27> Its 3 shots with 2nd one applying the buff
[2023-01-06 09:02:05] <LawdGoons> 3*
[2023-01-06 09:02:08] <luga227> Pog
[2023-01-06 09:02:08] <Eden_TheCat> so what happended to focussedd shot ?
[2023-01-06 09:02:09] <+Sandman27> But you lose a shot

[2023-01-06 09:02:18] <+nonax85> @Sandman27 which is compensated for
[2023-01-06 09:02:19] <LawdGoons> they ajusted the damage i believe
[2023-01-06 09:02:20] <+Ghistriam> Pog
[2023-01-06 09:02:22] <+Imbaslap> quicker dps window nice
[2023-01-06 09:02:52] <+507Blankz> Anyone have the link of the balance changes?
[2023-01-06 09:02:52] <+luminus1995> @sandman27 the 3rd shot did no dmg, only to tag the boss

[2023-01-06 09:03:07] <+Hetsu___> YEP double tap seems still better
[2023-01-06 09:03:10] <+nonax85> it's 45% before execution mode and 75% after isn't it?
[2023-01-06 09:03:11] <pureeugene> so 3 shots is terrible for TTH? PepeHands
[2023-01-06 09:03:16] <Kurenboi> the other one is nicer for aoe
[2023-01-06 09:03:26] <rtHzenhow> and you use fast aim now right?
[2023-01-06 09:03:26] <superkioro> Will the increased warlord tripods change the jump attack gameplay?
[2023-01-06 09:03:30] <vamPhyro> I have many
[2023-01-06 09:03:33] <+Sethyboy0> Do we know if the execution bonus is additive or multiplicative?
[2023-01-06 09:03:41] <zercy03> can you try checking for quikc finish too
[2023-01-06 09:03:48] <+Sethyboy0> You'd think it would be additive but then the sorc tripods are multiplicative
[2023-01-06 09:04:21] <+NotBisu> what classes have been talked about
[2023-01-06 09:04:23] <maxseven77> can we open his notes?

[2023-01-06 09:06:01] <+Sandman27> Looks so good
[2023-01-06 09:06:05] <+Imbaslap> the PS change is great for TTH
[2023-01-06 09:06:14] <+Imbaslap> fatty openers
[2023-01-06 09:06:15] <+Amatekrasu> it seems stronger, as it takes less number of skill shots with the change on a constant boss health
[2023-01-06 09:06:26] <+Vityra> i'm dumb at math but how does the 45% and 30% calculate vs 95%
[2023-01-06 09:06:26] <+Imbaslap> and FS
[2023-01-06 09:06:41] <IcceColdd> isn't that associated with a specific tripod?
[2023-01-06 09:06:42] <+CripplinDebt> they moved some damage from less than 50% to before 50% but overall its a little less damage :(

[2023-01-06 09:07:19] <%wolder1305> heres the notes
[2023-01-06 09:07:19] <NathanWearsPants> FINALLY, no more only critting awakening twice in a week
[2023-01-06 09:07:26] <+Imbaslap> 2 rifle dps tripod changes and TTH buff for awakening so its still a buff. and MS change helps too for QOL
[2023-01-06 09:07:36] <%+boxxy_gg> thx
[2023-01-06 09:07:47] <+Imbaslap> making it more reliable as TTH
[2023-01-06 09:07:53] <pureeugene> @Imbaslap is the 4 to 3 shots lesser total damage?
[2023-01-06 09:07:56] <kyuub1i1> BASED Dev's
[2023-01-06 09:07:57] <Eden_TheCat> so the new tripot on foccused shot is op or nah
[2023-01-06 09:08:03] <Eden_TheCat> ??
[2023-01-06 09:08:09] <+Imbaslap> its just easier to land it and you get more dmg at start of fights instead loaded at sub 50% hp
[2023-01-06 09:08:18] <+Imbaslap> its nice for TTH
[2023-01-06 09:08:18] <%feond> @ATK do u ever take the bleed on Perfect shot instead of paralys immunity? 󠀀
[2023-01-06 09:08:22] <kyuub1i1> @Eden_TheCat nothing is "op" on gs but it's great QoL
[2023-01-06 09:08:27] <+nonax85> people are throwing around a 15% overall buff for perfect shot
[2023-01-06 09:08:30] <+Imbaslap> and awakening now gets 45% crit
[2023-01-06 09:08:32] <+Sandman27> The dmg below 50% is slightly lower, but overall will be higher
[2023-01-06 09:08:33] <+Imbaslap> so u get a FAT opener
[2023-01-06 09:08:35] <+Imbaslap> like igniter

[2023-01-06 09:12:05] <%seaky81> Good morning, are the changes for Evolutionary Scouter good or bbad?
[2023-01-06 09:12:37] <%Tfortyone> I feel good for the past 1-2 patches, instead of nerfing godtier  classes to the ground, they instead make the weaker ones better overall
[2023-01-06 09:12:48] <+Imbaslap> ya it was super smodge being full spec and the 45% crit didnt apply to the awakening
[2023-01-06 09:12:54] <+pumqkins> @Pemife 4%~ dmg increase for both specs
[2023-01-06 09:12:56] <+Imbaslap> glad they changed

[2023-01-06 09:45:53] <Callisto3> punishing strike feels faster
[2023-01-06 09:46:01] <+Sarcueidre> Explosion worth to go for Reflux instant cast?
[2023-01-06 09:46:20] <Snaizzz> yeah we replacing frost call with explode now
[2023-01-06 09:46:27] <Floxner> critflux using explosion now? or swiftflux?
[2023-01-06 09:46:38] <bagermatt> Grudge?
[2023-01-06 09:46:40] <+Sandman27> No Grudge?
[2023-01-06 09:46:40] <Callisto3> i think both
[2023-01-06 09:46:42] <IcceColdd> no grudge?
[2023-01-06 09:46:45] <Snaizzz> both version tbh
[2023-01-06 09:46:47] <tragivre> they change some engraving?
[2023-01-06 09:47:04] <%+the_pikahu> you need rime arrow otherwise good
[2023-01-06 09:47:25] <Floxner> but if you run the piano reflux, frost call is must i think?

[2023-01-06 09:47:43] <%+the_pikahu> I don't run frost call on piano, it's only needed for meter regen
[2023-01-06 09:47:47] <Snaizzz> not needed anyway > more dps skill
[2023-01-06 09:47:50] <+Sarcueidre> @Snaizzz how do you maintant boundless with criflux without Frost Call
[2023-01-06 09:48:13] <Floxner> ^
[2023-01-06 09:48:16] <+Sandman27> Does Reflux use explosion?
[2023-01-06 09:48:28] <Floxner> or just go Casting reflux
[2023-01-06 09:48:31] <Asiandinghy> use shield at lvl 1
[2023-01-06 09:48:32] <Callisto3> its instant cast now
[2023-01-06 09:48:32] <Floxner> KEKL
[2023-01-06 09:48:35] <+Sarcueidre> I am debating which skill we should replace for Explosion
[2023-01-06 09:48:41] <%+the_pikahu> reflux can use explosion, but before you had to do the casting version and animation cancel using rime arrow
[2023-01-06 09:48:50] <+Patmvrc88> Hey Chat. I missed GL. Do CR need 3 now or still 1 engraving?
[2023-01-06 09:48:50] <+ChadWall> frost call as well
[2023-01-06 09:49:12] <WizemanLAB> @wineblue support DB viable now? KEKW
[2023-01-06 09:49:22] <Snaizzz> really not sure about crit version, unless u run more like a split stats and nto full crit
[2023-01-06 09:49:27] VIEWERS: 1 559
[2023-01-06 09:49:29] <%+the_pikahu> the new normal cast explosion is at 40% at ~1 sec cast time vs weak point at 60% at 1.5 sec cast time, so around the same dps just more convenient
[2023-01-06 09:49:35] <+ChadWall> instead of doomsday
[2023-01-06 09:49:35] <musamaycry> show deadeye next we are the outcast few lol
[2023-01-06 09:49:37] <nasjoied> doomsday
[2023-01-06 09:49:39] <%+rekamisama> no doomsday
[2023-01-06 09:49:41] <+Sandman27> you dont use doomsday
[2023-01-06 09:49:43] <+Sandman27> On insta cast
[2023-01-06 09:49:44] <+Ghistriam> @musamaycry already did i think
[2023-01-06 09:49:54] <Callisto3> you changed rime arrow or not?
[2023-01-06 09:49:54] <Jarosella> swift reflux need no doomsday
[2023-01-06 09:49:55] <Snaizzz> some version have DD
[2023-01-06 09:49:56] <ironwg> this is wrong build for swifness btw

[2023-01-06 09:50:13] <polemos4> fps KEKG
[2023-01-06 09:50:15] <+trophyv> reflux is 36% of KR
[2023-01-06 09:50:17] <+Sandman27> Casting version can do Doomsday explosion and Pushishing with all out attack
[2023-01-06 09:50:33] <Snaizzz> no one play casting reflux those
[2023-01-06 09:50:45] <Snaizzz> either Igniter or instant cast mostly
[2023-01-06 09:50:46] <IcceColdd> why no grudge on this build?
[2023-01-06 09:50:47] <%yoohyeonisn> holy apam wtf
[2023-01-06 09:50:48] <+Sarcueidre> i am playing crireflux tho
[2023-01-06 09:50:54] <TubeCat89> can you test with crit/swift and grudge?
[2023-01-06 09:51:08] <Floxner> but TBF, if you are running legion raid, casting reflux have higher dmg because he does mini burst between cutscene and mec?
[2023-01-06 09:51:10] <%+rekamisama> i think the new skill is better for crit reflux

[2023-01-06 09:51:15] <+Patmvrc88> Hey Chat. I missed GL. Do CR need 3 now or still 1 engraving?
[2023-01-06 09:51:17] <Floxner> rather than just swiftflux
[2023-01-06 09:51:21] <naster25> keen blunt?
[2023-01-06 09:51:22] <kasaiseigyo> atkR

[2023-01-06 09:51:30] <Erenshia> is kbw even good when u barely crits
[2023-01-06 09:51:33] <%+the_pikahu> yeah KBW prob not efficient at that crit
[2023-01-06 09:51:59] <Snaizzz> @Floxner yeah your dps will be more inline with something like a GS if u do casting
[2023-01-06 09:52:05] <TubeCat89> maybe use a bit more crit and not use raid captain might feel better no sure tho
[2023-01-06 09:52:05] <+Sandman27> Prob go HM instead of KBW?
[2023-01-06 09:52:24] <polemos4> WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-06 09:52:26] <kdotjames> explosion still has slow animation sadge
[2023-01-06 09:52:35] <Floxner> @Snaizzz yep, but critflux is higher than casting reflux in raid imo
[2023-01-06 09:52:38] <Floxner> also
[2023-01-06 09:52:46] <tamtamrane> 1 surge EZ
[2023-01-06 09:52:49] <TubeCat89> i think also dont need to use Magick Amp tripods if you dont use kbw
[2023-01-06 09:52:53] <Callisto3> yeah animation of explosion still sucks
[2023-01-06 09:53:06] <Snaizzz> @Floxner casting could just be crit flux too
[2023-01-06 09:53:06] <%+the_pikahu> yeah i prob won't use explosion, but the other buffs are nice
[2023-01-06 09:53:17] <gislae> can prob test Reflux/Grudge/HM/Adre/KBW as critflux
[2023-01-06 09:53:25] <Shaileyeu> what is the animation of explosion now?

[2023-01-06 09:53:35] <Floxner> @Snaizzz but casting you need AOA but critflux you can replace it KBW
[2023-01-06 09:53:35] <Snaizzz> pretty sure with new crit damage trypod now u do more damage
[2023-01-06 09:53:43] <+okasem> How’s critflux looking with the new buffs?
[2023-01-06 09:53:46] <vasnishkay> safeplay
[2023-01-06 09:54:08] <+Sandman27> What do you think about arcana still being the same strength?
[2023-01-06 09:54:21] <Snaizzz> tbh AOA technically a better damage am if u can keep all the channeling skill on kd compare to kbw
[2023-01-06 09:54:23] <+Sandman27> The difficulty justifies the dmg?
[2023-01-06 09:54:31] <+EvilTrickz> just got here which classes did he go through?
[2023-01-06 09:54:41] <lucasrukasus> ATK the Overdrive skill is a charge skill?
[2023-01-06 09:54:44] <Snaizzz> in testing

[2023-01-06 09:55:24] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Sandman27 the answer is yes, cuz it's either you are floor pov or you do smoge dmg if you don't know what your are doing

[2023-01-06 09:55:35] <%seaky81> Entropy any changes?
[2023-01-06 09:55:36] <Floxner> but your overall dps is lower than critflux because AOA only affect 3 skill, but if you use kbw / adren your oeverall dmg and miniburst is more higher

[2023-01-06 10:11:58] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> only one skill
[2023-01-06 10:11:59] <vxrion21> it lost when you out of persona
[2023-01-06 10:12:00] <+Vityra> so it's just to cast the red skill?
[2023-01-06 10:12:00] <+methionyl> this is how lunar works
[2023-01-06 10:12:02] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> that's how it works
[2023-01-06 10:12:05] <vxrion21> try use one skill
[2023-01-06 10:12:07] <vasnishkay> it's only in persona mode
[2023-01-06 10:12:09] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> you can only use one red skill when you use persona
[2023-01-06 10:12:13] <sta1os> your ambush skill only
[2023-01-06 10:12:14] <+Ghistriam> isnt persona when you turn invisible with the clone ?
[2023-01-06 10:12:16] <hik04> its for the 1 red skill right
[2023-01-06 10:12:16] <Erenshia> basically it buff your next red skill aspd
[2023-01-06 10:12:18] <sta1os> gets a speed up
[2023-01-06 10:12:23] <+trophyv> it turns off before skill is casted at least when memo did it
[2023-01-06 10:12:24] <immkamm> yea

[2023-01-06 10:16:18] <%+Synchronose> maybe the shadow clone attacks faster COPIUM

[2023-01-06 10:17:17] <+bhyun2> its the clone that gets the 10% LOL
[2023-01-06 10:17:17] <+NecrodomX> their idea was to increase the atk speed during persona mode XD but u get out of that once u use a skill- this makes no sense overall and could not be considered a buff or QOL - think it was better to have the atk speed active for max of 2 sec
[2023-01-06 10:17:20] <+damnnam> you can animation cancel before the back dash goes all the way now
[2023-01-06 10:17:23] <InFerNal52525> ATK what item lvl is next guardian raid after caliligos?
[2023-01-06 10:17:27] <%akkanbanshee> I think some1 was right, the clone has more attack speed CorgiDerp
[2023-01-06 10:17:29] <immkamm> back to the gate now reaper
[2023-01-06 10:17:29] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> Actually the buff is for her Ghost xD
[2023-01-06 10:17:31] <하제하제 (seohaje)> some videos already out with the attack speed working fine on red skills
[2023-01-06 10:17:31] <Erenshia> tbh they should just include the 10% aspd to the Lunar engravings
[2023-01-06 10:17:32] <vasnishkay> it shoud be work the same as lunar buff

[2023-01-06 10:19:18] <ShinONll> should be atleast a 3-5sec buff after pressing red skill for it to work properly
[2023-01-06 10:19:24] <+damnnam> try using red skill before persona back dash goes all the way, you can cancel some of it i think

[2023-01-06 10:24:54] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Ghistriam it's fine don't worry i'm the same as you, as long as you get a crit battery in your group it will outperform an adrenaline user

[2023-01-06 10:25:29] <saikodemon> I dont see why entropy classes shud get nerfed when the most frequent MVPs are non-positional
[2023-01-06 10:25:30] <Callisto3> they just tuned back att down a little

[2023-01-06 10:26:01] <dc2_r> Anyone have the link for the balance patch
[2023-01-06 10:26:15] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Ghistriam cuz that's the only difference you can technically do, or i guess go RElvl1 Cursed lvl 2 or 3 and Adrenaline lvl 2 or 3 kinda odd but i don't think the difference will be that big
[2023-01-06 10:26:17] <%+the_pikahu> Nerf entropy only if you play with GL and DB tho. granted which is a lot of the time.
[2023-01-06 10:26:20] <+Ghistriam> @Lord_Alucard_XIII well, im thinking maybe now KB, Adre 2 and RE 1 might be better

[2023-01-06 10:28:21] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Ghistriam honestly i don't think i'll need to change mine at all, i think the preformance will be overall the same regardless what build you pick, there is just more options
[2023-01-06 10:28:26] <%andredablio> red gunlancer lost in synergy but gained a little 4% buff, didn't changed as much

[2023-01-06 10:30:50] <sta1os> gunlancer saving grace is that it is still double damage synergy.
[2023-01-06 10:31:05] <+trophyv> Essentially all entropy classes got nerfed besides from Reaper...
[2023-01-06 10:31:18] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Ghistriam i feel like more spec won't change that much to how the class plays anymore, you still need 2 to 3 skills to hit to get all your 3 bubbles
[2023-01-06 10:31:20] <sta1os> reaper perfect suppression and deadeye
[2023-01-06 10:31:24] <+Ashelor> yeah but tbh reaper was bit behind on dmg anyway
[2023-01-06 10:31:29] <Callisto3> control glaivier got buff aswell

[2023-01-06 10:32:21] <+Ashelor> Also only red skills got buffed on Reaper
[2023-01-06 10:32:25] <sta1os> so the weaker entropy classes got compensated
[2023-01-06 10:32:26] <Lord_Alucard_XIII> @Ghistriam only on surge , the rest is unchanged
[2023-01-06 10:32:32] <veLnoOM> why 4%?? isnt it 8% cause it stacks GL and DB syn or am i wrong??
[2023-01-06 10:32:42] <onigor> isnt it 9+3=12 and 5+4=9 so we lost 3% on entropy classes?
[2023-01-06 10:32:45] <+luminus1995> @ATK also you don't have to hit bash for ATK buff

[2023-01-06 10:37:12] <+NecrodomX> so does that mean RE will need RE3 instead of what some people us (RE1 with Adre 2) ?
[2023-01-06 10:37:17] <TheClipBeat> are you telling me igniter stays the same and summoner gets nerfed?
