[2023-01-09 06:28:57] <@^Nightbot> I'm not very happy with the loot changes overall, I think they were pretty silly along with the butchering of harvest progression. We'll have to see how buffed the changes are after the patch. As a solo player it's going to be very hard for me to tell the difference.

You’re very arrogant, belittling and a prick to most your viewers. Maybe stop streaming you don’t seem to enjoy it by the way you interact with most your viewers good luck with ur streams

[2023-01-09 16:01:50] <%Aeloa> @Pohx I have spent around 200c in Essenses so far on my Glorious Plate. Still not a great roll lol. Do you also try to use Annulmetns and Slams if you see something good?
[2023-01-09 16:02:15] <treez1337> passive tree gives us 90% convertion phys to fire. Should i craft 25% conversion on my gloves to make it 100%? (using explode sceptre)
[2023-01-09 16:02:19] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Aeloa if its not fractured then expect to spend some more
[2023-01-09 16:02:25] <@%lemoncoolers> @treez1337 90% is enough

[2023-01-09 16:04:25] <@%lemoncoolers> @treez1337 what craft? are you using asenaths?
[2023-01-09 16:04:45] <@%lemoncoolers> there is no interaction between melding and loreweave lol
[2023-01-09 16:04:53] <%Aeloa> @Pohx Thank you will try. I was going to get a different Fracture but they have really shot up in price.
[2023-01-09 16:04:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> well like we got on the topic of melding cause willy is playing ruthless and kripp dropped a melding in ruthless. so i was like "oh all kripp needs is 60 unique rings" took me a solid 15 minutes to realize my mistake Despairge

[2023-01-09 16:05:14] <treez1337> @lemoncoolers no, using explode sceptre. Craft is: 25% of phys damage converted to fire damge
[2023-01-09 16:05:18] <@%GoGoLoThirty> it was bedtime for sure
[2023-01-09 16:05:31] <rony6634> @Pohx rf helmet base still not found yet ?
[2023-01-09 16:06:03] <@%lemoncoolers> @treez1337 It's hard for me to believe you have nothing better to craft but if that's truly the case then of course, it's a no brainer. Do what you like.

[2023-01-09 16:26:03] <@%GoGoLoThirty> you can friends and then swap later too, if you want more ties
[2023-01-09 16:26:06] <RustlingTV> correct swap option is very rare so best is to demote him to rank 0 and wait for someone to introduce him there

[2023-01-09 16:29:29] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lighteasyweight rarity is for getting +magic, +rare, +unique stuff

[2023-01-09 16:32:20] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lighteasyweight right now i am playing MF tornado shot using wandering path and delirium/harvest. eventually when i get turbo map pool from wandering path i will swap over to juicing strongboxes and skittering/divine deli orbs

[2023-01-09 16:35:31] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lighteasyweight basically you do 11 favoured of the map u want, 1 of the next best connected map you can sell or run quickly, and then get 100% connected drop chance and some map duplication with wandering path. most ppl pair it with harvest quant and growing hordes to make small profit while they build their map pool

[2023-01-09 16:37:32] <omid__79> how important is rarity in ssf? never played
[2023-01-09 16:37:55] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @omid__79 depends what youre doing. lots of builds can benefit from a bit of rarity sprinkled on top for free
[2023-01-09 16:38:33] <@%GoGoLoThirty> plenty of mf guides say if you dont have a big budget (which certainly applies to most ssf gaming) then youre better off with a normal strong build with just a few affixes as rarity
[2023-01-09 16:38:44] <@%ShinnyChicken> I still think you need mageblood for it to be tanky, I got inspired by your occultist LL RF - made something similar

[2023-01-09 19:04:23] <@%lemoncoolers> There's no "priority". Loreweave doesn't increase or decrease your res. It just sets it to that amount. No two ways about it. It negates any increases or decreases because it forces them to be exactly that. @Lyvcan

[2023-01-09 20:54:05] <tatiantel7> The_DutchLion there's a quest line once you get to yellow tier maps to witness eater/exarch type maps and you just follow the quest text and it will eventually lead you into t16s and once you complete the tutorial beginner fights you should have 2 voidstones relatively easily

[2023-01-09 21:06:40] <BLUcorp> I'm not really good at avoiding stuff, so I really don't like sanctum that much.
[2023-01-09 21:06:40] <+jay_g_1337> same here... still mapping for me is best^^
[2023-01-09 21:06:47] <Maxiuxs> how about rf inq delving
[2023-01-09 21:06:56] <Goodluckmode> is sanctum going to stay next patch

[2023-01-09 21:07:03] <%+ArcticIceFox> The 8% endurance charge damage on disciple of unyielding...does that stack with the jugg ascendancy? sorry, didnt seen an annoint section on website

[2023-01-09 21:08:41] <+OvidiuHGF> thats op
[2023-01-09 21:09:08] <adolebitque> Eh you're 460/250 ur doing great anyway
[2023-01-09 21:09:10] <+Cosmovagabond> @ArcticIceFox the most efficient annoint is always chrisma or whipser of doom since one of them gives you additional aura, one gives you huge damage boost with addition curse (flam + elem weak). But they are expensive, so if you are short of golden oil or chaos orb just go w/e you think it's best
[2023-01-09 21:09:22] <+DutyMarv> ur RF Build is they first time for me to get this far into the game SSF (98 35% now), only stuff i havent dont is Feared and Ubers. I love it

[2023-01-09 21:54:44] <hornelch> no worries <3 The single cluster has Melding already and I am looking for the next step. Keep doing what you're doing!

[2023-01-09 22:10:06] <+Medrugal> hey Pohx, one question? with the crown of eyes, spell damage also applies to attack damage at 150% value does that only mean the % increased spell damage or also the added damage to spells like 50-220 added lightning damage to spells?

[2023-01-09 22:52:00] <%+Cosmovagabond> Pohx, you think it's possible to intergrade blackflame into your build? most mobs have lower chaos res
[2023-01-09 22:52:08] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @kikyo109 if you want money + xp lots of ppl enjoying either infinite sustain harvest with wandering path, OR breach/legion juicing dunes
[2023-01-09 22:52:31] <%+Cosmovagabond> blackflame converts all ignite to chaos damage over time
[2023-01-09 22:52:47] <%+Cosmovagabond> so all the fire multi still applies
[2023-01-09 22:52:49] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah i dont think this build is doing a significant enough amount of ignite scaling
[2023-01-09 22:53:07] <@%lemoncoolers> @Cosmovagabond RF isn't ignite damage
[2023-01-09 22:53:11] <%+kikyo109> @kikyo109 thanks. im at the stage now with my rf i need divine orbs to purchase as im super new to crafting

[2023-01-09 22:53:19] <@%GoGoLoThirty> fire trap hits hard we just arent crit and arent grabbing that much ignite chance, so its more than just slapping the item
[2023-01-09 22:53:28] <%+Cosmovagabond> @Cosmovagabond ohhhhhhh
[2023-01-09 22:53:38] <@%lemoncoolers> also DoT can't be converted
[2023-01-09 22:53:50] <linusno> would you recommend rf ocultist?
[2023-01-09 22:53:56] <%+Cosmovagabond> dang it, thought i came up with a good idea hahhaha
[2023-01-09 22:53:59] <@%lemoncoolers> @linusno no
[2023-01-09 22:54:00] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah DoT being totally unable to convert is slightly hidden as a mech, definitely important to know
[2023-01-09 22:54:59] <%+Cosmovagabond> @GoGoLoThirty tbh RF as a skill itself is very confusing to understand
[2023-01-09 22:55:13] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @GoGoLoThirty yeah it has some quirks leftover from back in the day
