[2022-12-31 01:00:17] <+Ang3lis> Hey Hikaru! You're really the only Chess guy I watch so I could only send this to you. I noticed something during the Magnus vs Rapport game. Here is ChessBase Indias YouTube that I watched it on. https://youtu.be/Vw_PmYd1jh8   If you watch in the two moves after 8:27 it looks like Magnus makes an illegal move that no one noticed. or maybe I'm just a scrub and don't know about it. Maybe I'll see a video from you on it. take care man!!

[2022-12-31 17:29:46] <@%^Moobot> @deluxepuppet A very good place to start to learn chess or to start to develop a plan no matter your level: https://www.chess.com/article/view/study-plan-directory?ref_id=15448422 - Another good place for video learning is the Youtube channel of Hikaru's friend Levy: https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess/
