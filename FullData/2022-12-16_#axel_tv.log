[2022-12-16 20:28:03] <@%ImSoBurr_> MrSergo15 I mean, to a degree you are right, but what I mean is they need to do more tactical stuff instead of walking backwards into doorways and shooting the walls for no reason LUL

[2022-12-16 20:31:31] <%Deathman1000> @727life but they're never going to play the game as often as someone like Axel or hell even just someone who plays this casually, they work on it all day every day can be rough to then put significant time in. They can be bad at the game and still play it you know? It's why testing in live environment is so important so people who play the shit out of the game can give the right feedback

[2022-12-16 20:34:07] <%Deathman1000> gonna be a lot of raids like this when they make labs accessible only in raid. so many people will never get to it
[2022-12-16 20:34:07] <+urlocalxanman> Do they do the 1$ traders every wipe? ive only played 3

[2022-12-16 20:36:33] <%+MrSergo15> Needing 20+ raids to find a boss ONCE does not make you want to come back, it's just annoying and since they already nerfed the shit out of boss loot, what's the point of keeping the spawns so low
[2022-12-16 20:36:45] <RoldyFTW> Only got to lvl like 30 or sth
[2022-12-16 20:36:46] <+TacticalToupee> Do you think Labs is empty because they made key cards more difficult to get?
[2022-12-16 20:36:48] <Mrjunglecat> lots of people skipped this wipe cuz it was the same as the wipe before it

[2022-12-16 20:40:03] <%Deathman1000> I think part of the game bing so dead is that theres basically nothing to do late game when most of the playerbase goes off. late game it's all about pvp and without players theres no pvp. arena should help a bit, but we need more takss/story tasks. 1.0 literally cannot come fast enough

[2022-12-16 21:01:47] <@mstrZORG> MyAvatar
[2022-12-16 21:01:50] <TekarukiteCZ> You need to take breaks and play tarkov so you aren't bored anymore but angry
[2022-12-16 21:01:57] <TekarukiteCZ> That's how I do it
[2022-12-16 21:02:01] <@%727life> nah tarky still boring PepeLaugh @mstrZORG

[2022-12-16 21:03:00] <+sinisterous_foori> i feel the same sadly, I don'"t really know what we might need in  the game to make it lively again.
[2022-12-16 21:03:04] <%Thrillpickle> What is Tarkov?  Baby don't shoot, me don't shoot me, no more

[2022-12-16 21:04:24] <@%727life> some players (such as myself) have pretty much given up on the game until a major update or Arena
[2022-12-16 21:04:30] <+sinisterous_foori> I expect it to be really an option to improve on my pvp skills

[2022-12-16 21:12:09] <@%727life> If they do drops the 29th-7th
[2022-12-16 21:12:12] <%$xBashkingx> so Wipe 22 ?
[2022-12-16 21:12:13] <%shootable> That is so far away

[2022-12-16 21:12:19] <@%727life> What's the point in wiping and then doing drops...? We already went though that
[2022-12-16 21:12:23] <+sinisterous_foori> @sinisterous_foori most surely

[2022-12-16 21:13:08] <%bfcheg> the point is to show twitchers how dumb they are
[2022-12-16 21:13:14] <NuFFeAlmighty> 727 aint 777, so not making sence makes sence
[2022-12-16 21:13:20] <+onlyfansjoku> @727life It was good people got cases and stuff too
[2022-12-16 21:13:23] <%+Thun_Dhar> the last Christmas wipe i think they did wipe then drops
[2022-12-16 21:13:24] <%+D3viat0r> How would u make the 545/39s good?  Increased their fire rate over the 762/39 more?  Or nerf 762BP?
[2022-12-16 21:13:24] <+De_Kameraden> @Axel_tv  but maybe wipe a week earlier? 22th? so we play wipe first week and then drops hit so servers dont take a massive hit by getting wipe AND twitch drop combiend?
[2022-12-16 21:13:30] <Okwonkquest> have you completed your degree?
[2022-12-16 21:13:32] <%$xBashkingx> if your do Drops and then Wipe nobody gonna watch the Streeams

[2022-12-16 21:13:41] <+mirrorstruth11> Do the drops even drop anything good though?  I thought they had to tone all that back

[2022-12-16 21:14:20] <@mstrZORG> still no kappa
[2022-12-16 21:14:22] <@%727life> My point is it's dumb to do this during wipe again, so either they are going to do it before wipe and be pointless or after and cuase issues LUL
[2022-12-16 21:14:23] <@mstrZORG> omg...
[2022-12-16 21:14:47] <@%727life> Yeah I wasn't saying it's smart

[2022-12-16 21:55:14] <+Blue_KQ> I think they are asking if partial crouching reduces it a little bit or does the effect only happen when you are fully crouched.

[2022-12-16 22:38:40] <%voxorgroso> I hope the twitch drops are decent, not some garbo cigarettes like last time LUL
[2022-12-16 22:38:48] <TigRio_XXL> is it better to play agressive than passive for a regular player ? :) @Axel_tv
[2022-12-16 22:38:49] <%bfcheg> do you get drops while watching ads?
[2022-12-16 22:38:58] <%$onkel_gigla> @voxorgroso most likley gonna be shit again

[2022-12-16 22:39:59] <+souschef2403> why would they do drops when gunna wipe anyways
[2022-12-16 22:40:29] <%Gobull4> time tho upgrade to next amd 3dx when they got release! now i have i9 9900k KEKW and is not enough
[2022-12-16 22:40:38] <%+TheFlobold> @souschef2403 they do drops after wipe
[2022-12-16 22:40:42] <+thinking223> @Axel_tv well I have 16RAM and im upgrading it to 32RAM will it increase fps or just decrease stutter?
[2022-12-16 22:40:47] <+LenDatsov> are we definitely getting streets?
[2022-12-16 22:40:48] <+souschef2403> yep nice
[2022-12-16 22:40:52] <%hintsoflime> then the drops are gonna be garbage
[2022-12-16 22:40:52] <+sneak024> best thing but streets you think/hope?
[2022-12-16 22:41:07] <%shootable> Why do people say drops kill the servers
[2022-12-16 22:41:16] <%voxorgroso> we fuckin’ with the wipe or nah ⁉️⁉️⁉️
[2022-12-16 22:41:17] <%Dastas85> is this ur highest rank in tarkov?
[2022-12-16 22:41:19] <%hintsoflime> If we dont get streets it gonna hurt tarkov a lot
[2022-12-16 22:41:19] <%+xaveir> partial streets or full streets hmmMeeting
[2022-12-16 22:41:27] <cp13lol> will u sell your gpu?
[2022-12-16 22:41:31] <%$xBashkingx> @shootable it did in the past
[2022-12-16 22:41:33] <Smoky3D> should I buy 3090 for 1k $ even though my processor will bottle neck 23% @Axel_tv
[2022-12-16 22:41:37] <phishsmokin1> I heard that labs are only available by going into the streets of tarkov? Have you heard of this?
[2022-12-16 22:41:37] <+souschef2403> i remember that
[2022-12-16 22:41:46] <+oJc_tv> @Smoky3D NO
[2022-12-16 22:41:52] <+killerprincess1995> could you explain how drops work?
[2022-12-16 22:41:55] VIEWERS: 725
[2022-12-16 22:41:57] <%$xBashkingx> @Smoky3D for 1k you can get 7900xtx/xt
[2022-12-16 22:42:01] <+f1nnanator> ya some people think u can only get onto labs by going through certain maps
[2022-12-16 22:42:02] <%+xaveir> remember that one wipe for the christmas or new years present they gave us like 1000 BP KEKW
[2022-12-16 22:42:19] <%+SteelRhythm> @xaveir That immedately luined that wipe
[2022-12-16 22:42:25] <%+SteelRhythm> ruined that wipe*
[2022-12-16 22:42:30] <%Dastas85> @Axel_tv what is ur highest rank in tarkov over all wipes?
[2022-12-16 22:42:31] <%voxorgroso> @xaveir now it’s a pack of cigarettes, take it or leave it
[2022-12-16 22:42:39] <Smoky3D> i pref nvidia, need cuda cores for work
[2022-12-16 22:42:41] <%+xaveir> Smoge taking it
[2022-12-16 22:42:48] <+sneak024> but you have to open your drops to get the next drop right?
[2022-12-16 22:42:56] <+im_boone> yeah
[2022-12-16 22:42:59] <%Gobull4> tarkov is cpu based, on what invest depends what kind of game you are gonna play
[2022-12-16 22:43:07] <Le_Tangiers> to make it simple, watch Axel and free loot
