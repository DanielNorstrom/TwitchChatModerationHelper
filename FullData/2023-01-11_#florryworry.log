[2023-01-11 14:58:26] <simonoden> Are we flipping back to catholic?
[2023-01-11 14:58:31] <%madgmm91> hei @florryworry just tuned in, are u converting back to catholic?
[2023-01-11 14:58:39] <@Maynesss> @madgmm91 not yet, for future
[2023-01-11 14:59:06] <%Tayip999> @Florryworry is there a good culture in japan to flip to then release those countries to retain cores

[2023-01-11 14:59:09] <@Maynesss> @swisshaliax exception, we don't want 500 attempts
[2023-01-11 14:59:18] <lSaVaNTl> is the Japanese gold mine event random, or is there a specific list of provinces it can target?
[2023-01-11 14:59:28] <lSaVaNTl> it seemed pretty random from what I saw
[2023-01-11 14:59:47] <n0xkappa> can someone tell me how the france war ended
[2023-01-11 14:59:55] <@Maynesss> @n0xkappa L
[2023-01-11 14:59:56] <viktor_1972> @maynesss yeah i understand that, but it kills the legitimate of this run imo
[2023-01-11 14:59:57] <%Tayip999> there is no war in ba sing se
[2023-01-11 15:00:08] <n0xkappa> @n0xkappa thanks

[2023-01-11 15:00:54] <%LordSeru> @Florryworry we don't mind! :)
[2023-01-11 15:00:54] <%nickwizzo> it's fine, we've seen that start so many times

[2023-01-11 15:01:00] <%jaeger2323> its fine
[2023-01-11 15:01:00] <Mawan> It's good
[2023-01-11 15:01:03] <%ralf9198> the beginning of this run is pretty slow anyway

[2023-01-11 15:01:04] <!%+KaiserDrakul> It's not a bird, it was science
[2023-01-11 15:01:05] <Ecoarone> I would allow birds in every run, so i'm all for it!

[2023-01-11 15:01:11] <simonoden> We really don‚Äôt mind, rather that than rewatch the start <3
[2023-01-11 15:01:12] <lSaVaNTl> I would prefer that you just go full balls
[2023-01-11 15:01:13] <efes__> I don't, it's effing insane even with (limited) birding
[2023-01-11 15:01:13] <impo997_JOJDJH> I mean 5 days of independence wars is enough YEP
[2023-01-11 15:01:16] <+Schaaafrichter> its ok. we can start 1444 tomorrow Kappa
[2023-01-11 15:01:22] <31Topsecret> It's alright Florryworry strim is no fun if you're having no fun
[2023-01-11 15:01:23] <!%+KaiserDrakul> Plus we're happy to see the run go on and not force you to reset Florryworry florryjutsAyaya

[2023-01-11 15:01:30] <Leeroyoh> i hate no balls runs
[2023-01-11 15:01:30] <Mawan> We've seen the start plenty of time already, no need to show us you can do the same thing again and again one more time
[2023-01-11 15:01:31] <%blacksarena0701> i like less birden stream
[2023-01-11 15:01:36] <viktor_1972> @stevenosan11 birding twice after france attacks him. until he found a solution so france doesn't attack him
[2023-01-11 15:01:38] <%ralf9198> no cb france lol
[2023-01-11 15:01:38] <%atticussss_> how is otto doing
[2023-01-11 15:01:48] <Bleederhosen> This music is driving me nuts\
[2023-01-11 15:01:54] <stevenosan11> ah i see thank you
[2023-01-11 15:01:56] <+HyperspacePotatos> New rule that if you see german minors in kamchatka, you get a free bird? SeemsGood
[2023-01-11 15:02:18] <%dna_factory> @Florryworry I'm playing prussia allied to Russia, France and Ottoman in normal, Of course I will mind you birding in very hard with no allies Kappa

[2023-01-11 15:02:26] <Ecoarone> @Florryworry if you do 1444 (not saying you should), please consider dropping the no balls ruleset. This type of run is interesting without arbitrary rules tacked on imo
[2023-01-11 15:02:39] <kamileo96> rip

[2023-01-11 15:03:15] <dgiggi> @Ecoarone he already said it becomes trivial with allies and loans
[2023-01-11 15:03:20] <%ralf9198> @Ecoarone i would keep them, but allow yourself a checkpoint every 10-20 years, kind of like what he did now
[2023-01-11 15:03:32] <efes__> I think as long as birding is limited (i.e., not rolling every little thing until it
[2023-01-11 15:03:40] <ketchup107> ThisIsFine

[2023-01-11 15:03:41] <%jaeger2323> too close for my comfort @Florryworry
[2023-01-11 15:03:43] <KaffeMedFika> I think the starts are the most fun
[2023-01-11 15:03:46] <@Maynesss> @Florryworry what do you think of like 25 year checkpoints for these types of runs?
[2023-01-11 15:03:52] <%Tayip999> checkpoints are definitely the best way
[2023-01-11 15:03:58] <lSaVaNTl> do it however you want king
[2023-01-11 15:04:01] <31Topsecret> Just drop the b from the balls

[2023-01-11 15:04:32] <viktor_1972> @maynesss that's cheating imo. just drop the BALLS rule in this type of runs
[2023-01-11 15:04:36] <efes__> yeah, precisely, rolling with as much as you can take is the fun part; restarting yet again is not the fun part
