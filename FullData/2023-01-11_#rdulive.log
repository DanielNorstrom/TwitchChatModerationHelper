[2023-01-11 13:55:02] <%quixoticpragmatic> @jahboy55 that’s fair. Blizzards position (which I don’t agree with) is probably that most tribes have more than one option, and they want variety to come from banned tribes more than new minions

[2023-01-11 14:27:54] <physikbar> what do you think about the new hero, kripp revealed?
[2023-01-11 14:27:54] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking. HmmmG
