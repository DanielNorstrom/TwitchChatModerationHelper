[2022-12-28 00:23:37] <%+mikolhs> @hearthanalysis Druid destroys those. I'm going to keep pushing druid lol. Pally does extremely well into druid though so it is a give and take.
[2022-12-28 00:23:43] <sonofman1930> Also scamming points when he lost.
[2022-12-28 00:23:49] <HelixFossil89> Devilsmouth it was guaranteed wasn't it?
[2022-12-28 00:23:53] <deamqe> that warlock deck has been pretty popular lately
[2022-12-28 00:24:00] <hearthanalysis> @hearthanalysis Yeah the aggro pally gets really frustrating when you get countered or your barnoness cards are kind of trash.  But I legit went straight from D5 to legend with shockspitter with 0 losses, maybe I just got lucky
[2022-12-28 00:24:10] <saddochi> @devilsmouth he played order
[2022-12-28 00:24:22] <Jiddy9106> This warlock deck is just dumb
