[2023-01-06 19:19:22] <%lazchance> EYE personally really enjoyed the Apex content
[2023-01-06 19:19:23] <%AlmightyHeadass> I think lootboxes should be implemented into the battle pass. like you get 1 per 10 levels starting at level 5
[2023-01-06 19:19:25] <%+AverageSupportPlayer> ow2 just missed the mark given how long it was hyped for. I think by season 4 they can probably have figured things out but by then it'll be too late and most of the community will be gone again
[2023-01-06 19:19:25] <+OriginalCcar> did you try out the new deathmatch mode?

[2023-01-06 19:19:26] <rabidraider19> apex as a game has went downhill so badly
[2023-01-06 19:19:26] <+ifipaan2> comp doesn’t feel rewarding because a lot of the base Quality of life changes from ow1 are gone entirely, and while the new ranked system works much better, it FEELS less rewarding. imo you should get a bunch of battle pass XP at the end of a comp season

[2023-01-06 19:19:32] <NikFlyer> Ow2 gameplay is a bit better, but literally everything else is worse than Ow1, including rewards, progressions, events, everything.
[2023-01-06 19:19:33] <+elit3member> Overwatch 1 yikes the people that only saying that is because they loved the 2 tanks where everyone in your team has their ult they all use it which makes fights last too long metroSlam
[2023-01-06 19:19:34] <%sinistersinns> Nostalgia is a difficult lens to see truth.
[2023-01-06 19:19:38] <Faxis1> i miss having to argue with your team for who was going to play support

[2023-01-06 19:19:50] <PunGolden> I liked having 2 tanks
[2023-01-06 19:19:53] <%cheerskristen> @IIplantII thanks for the gifted sub flatsH
[2023-01-06 19:19:54] <+ifipaan2> OW2 plays better but in every other regard ow1 was MUCH much better
[2023-01-06 19:19:58] <DuckGamer964> ow 1 had higher highs but lower lows imo
[2023-01-06 19:19:58] <basicroyalty> I think OW2 is hard right now, based on how they’ve pre-planned stuff. I’m just holding out for Season 3.
[2023-01-06 19:20:02] <%$atsBrew> open queue was an experience YEP

[2023-01-06 19:20:07] <Cpttazerbear> How do I convince my friend mercy/Lucio is not the best support comp every time I try he just brings up his healing numbers
[2023-01-06 19:20:07] <paulinator______> Would you play something like gta rp flats?
[2023-01-06 19:20:09] <+ifipaan2> I don’t miss open queue or the fucking STUN simulator of ow1
[2023-01-06 19:20:09] <S1ren_ow> I wish prestige tiers had something more rewarding but I get that not everyone's gonna get to them
[2023-01-06 19:20:10] <angpugemo> loot boxes will revive this game
[2023-01-06 19:20:11] <rabidraider19> @flats just make sure to take care of yourself and your mental health
[2023-01-06 19:20:11] <%+TheFlyPelican> 6 torbs though was P fun
[2023-01-06 19:20:17] <%+electric_lain> i never thought I would play OW again until I realized they added role queue
[2023-01-06 19:20:17] <Faxis1> i miss goats :))
[2023-01-06 19:20:18] <%Stonks368> Goats was a good time COPIUM  Kapp
[2023-01-06 19:20:19] <%digitalhadoken1> ah yes 1tank 4 damage 1 support.. vs goats good time
[2023-01-06 19:20:20] <+jayecks> the balance in OW2 is much more frustrating, you end up into forced picks too much because of OP heroes
[2023-01-06 19:20:22] <Raepopsicles> I would just like a better balanced 6v6, one barrier per team, would make some heroes much less frustrating to play against.
[2023-01-06 19:20:22] <mellojello47> 7v7 but each team gets 2 extra support or dps
[2023-01-06 19:20:22] <%+ierofrnk> I don’t even touch open queue
[2023-01-06 19:20:25] <Mauserek> gameplay is the most important part of the game for me so OW2 being better than OW1 gameplay-wise is enough for me
[2023-01-06 19:20:25] <%ow_sigmaeats> Open queue was very stupid when you remember goats was a thing
[2023-01-06 19:20:26] <akarbzz> ow 2 is like ow 1s inbred extra chromosomed baby

[2023-01-06 19:20:33] <SaRX6> Being honest I have only played comp properly twice since ow2 came out it just doesn't feel the same I got pissed off placing 3 ranks lower than I should, not seeing my Sr after ever game ect just doesn't hit the same it used to for me.

[2023-01-06 19:30:04] <NikFlyer> @Flats Gta rpservers are as good as admins allow them to be. Most admins REALLY hate fun and have like 5 lists of things you CAN’T do. They don’t allow freedom of expression, they always want you to play by the book, which makes no sense when RP is about freedom of roleplaying.

[2023-01-06 20:00:42] <%$atsBrew> @Hakuna_Mufasa oh jesus peepoS
[2023-01-06 20:00:42] <MoJiggyGG> Still her survivability is probably pretty low on sniper heavy maps like Circuit
[2023-01-06 20:00:54] <hanagaru> heyyy
[2023-01-06 20:00:55] <+Bajn> jq makes a statement.  confident enough in my tank abilities to play her
[2023-01-06 20:01:08] <%$atsBrew> she's a good definition of a brawl tank and I love the buffs NODDERS
[2023-01-06 20:01:11] <%victorjua14> If you use the axe on ball’s mines, they count also and lower the cooldown
[2023-01-06 20:01:13] <%hellupline> my only problem with JQ is that u need a good aim to play with her,  thats not my department
[2023-01-06 20:01:22] <%$Edatox_Sarenu> huge
[2023-01-06 20:01:22] <%Stonks368> Shes not a tempo tank, shes a fun tank YEP
[2023-01-06 20:01:30] <ReekOktober> better than emongs lmao
[2023-01-06 20:01:31] <%djzander_> she’s like orisa but more fun, as in like having cooldowns often and being able to do something constantly
[2023-01-06 20:01:41] <MoJiggyGG> @hellupline rein main I assume?
[2023-01-06 20:01:42] <Raepopsicles> My issue with her is just that she has an awful voice, otherwise she's alright kit-wise.
[2023-01-06 20:01:47] <dragonking6084> hey flats, thoughts on the new olympus mode?
[2023-01-06 20:01:48] <hanagaru> @hellupline the knife is kinda hard to hit 😭

[2023-01-06 20:02:04] <+ceilingenjoyer> JQ seems fun but I’m kinda tired of the kit complexity creep of new characters. I wish we’d get more characters as simple as Rein or Cass
[2023-01-06 20:02:04] <%apooooop> I always feel like I don't really know why my queen is making or taking space, but it seems to work so I just kinda accept it
[2023-01-06 20:02:12] <+heyimnav> @Raepopsicles her voice is the best part about her
[2023-01-06 20:02:16] <%hellupline> @MoJiggyGG I play rein orisa and hog
[2023-01-06 20:02:16] <MoJiggyGG> @raepopsicles her voice is soothing wym
[2023-01-06 20:02:17] <%$Edatox_Sarenu> @yflores21 nope. comp isnt worth it nowadays
[2023-01-06 20:02:19] <%fireblazewolf420> Junker needs a new voice line where she yells "Its time for the spinning Poop axe" Kappa

[2023-01-06 20:37:00] <%+OBS1D1ANKN1GHT> i enjoy brig depending on the map/tank
[2023-01-06 20:37:00] <Deadshot3002> jq meta sounds awesome
[2023-01-06 20:37:01] <%Godzilla12546> dude I play brig through thick and thin 610 hours I know how she works she's awsome
[2023-01-06 20:37:04] <Lord0fContagion> Brig has always been good
[2023-01-06 20:37:06] <%Seegrums> I think the brig transition would be slow - and they wouldn’t say anything

[2023-01-06 20:37:11] <Tauntaun707> They'll find an excuse
[2023-01-06 20:37:13] <masterraccoonthief> Cuz half the time they’re just impressed when I ball out but the other half it’s just “great a brig” in the chat immediately
[2023-01-06 20:37:13] <+bugsplat_> they giga buffed her guys COPIUM hear me out
[2023-01-06 20:37:15] <%Seegrums> @lord0fcontagion booooo
[2023-01-06 20:37:15] <DoctorDavid95> it depends if she's meta because of her own o because of the synergy with more powerful characters
[2023-01-06 20:37:16] <+clark_kent022> is it all going back to the dive meta again?
[2023-01-06 20:37:18] <trueblacksheep0711> no one will acknowledge that shes been amazing this whole time
[2023-01-06 20:37:19] <%Fate_Chunk> I feel like her kit has always been good, people try to play her as a tank to much and shes not that
[2023-01-06 20:37:19] <Kitizenz> Thank you for letting me know 😭 as an Ana main I was terrified
[2023-01-06 20:37:20] <masterraccoonthief> Or “pls switch brig”
[2023-01-06 20:37:22] <Lord0fContagion> and shitting on pubs who dont know how good she is
[2023-01-06 20:37:22] <Doot0Lord> you have to think how good is jq against her other matchups

[2023-01-06 20:37:25] <kaychu347> i like junker queen is it worth picking her up
[2023-01-06 20:37:26] <%a_witcher> isnt brig getting a rework next patch or was that it?
[2023-01-06 20:37:27] <%+lazorbheemz> she rein just faster

[2023-01-06 20:37:56] <Umbra_Skull> all the supports have always been strong, brig is just the "least meta" right now
[2023-01-06 20:37:57] <shombwa> FLATS DID U KNOW THAT IF U axe a fence, on jq, it counts as a entity so it males ability charge quicker, so if u axe 3 fence it recherges instantly kekw
[2023-01-06 20:37:59] <%thedogbeard> i think they should give her shield 1200 health, her 625 health and give her a longer more powerful charge ability

[2023-01-06 20:39:44] <ilovemen561> ball can weirdly be really good
[2023-01-06 20:39:45] <%a_witcher> ball is difficult to balance .. if you buff him hes OP and if hes balanced he is niche
[2023-01-06 20:39:48] <%+kazenblade29> What would you prefer one shot meta or double shield? @flats
[2023-01-06 20:39:58] <trueblacksheep0711> how far does that axe swing actually go he keeps swinging so early at far targets
[2023-01-06 20:40:12] <ilovemen561> masters is only a rank higher then diamond
[2023-01-06 20:40:12] <%ow_sigmaeats> Imma make a joke flats will love nerf rein and make him a dps
[2023-01-06 20:40:20] <%Mortemp1> did you ever test to see if the instant heal on junker queen applys the full 30 or whats left on the dot?
[2023-01-06 20:40:24] <angpugemo> no bet this time?

[2023-01-06 20:40:27] <%blueberrybench> @elemental_harper it true you have plats playing masters it low rank
[2023-01-06 20:40:27] <squeezyf1> @kazenblade29 Is That Even A Question?
[2023-01-06 20:40:28] <%a_witcher> @trueblacksheep0711 he expects for them to run into it
[2023-01-06 20:40:29] <%+ImGenemy> @trueblacksheep0711 the actual animation take literally like 2 sec so u have to
[2023-01-06 20:40:36] <ilovemen561> i bet 60 dollars he wins

[2023-01-06 20:40:42] <%+jodrajoko> I don't think every tank needs to be these meta heroes that everyone plays its ok to have niches
[2023-01-06 20:40:46] <Doot0Lord> I feel like susu influences the meta alot. I still think that ability is too much
[2023-01-06 20:40:49] <%+Zoinkdd> best supports to play with JQ? @flats
[2023-01-06 20:40:52] <felix7> hitting a knife on a dps or support feels sooooo good
[2023-01-06 20:40:54] <%sinistersinns> @imgenemy I sure hope so, Rein is my favorite tank and has been since beginning of OW1
[2023-01-06 20:40:54] <%+jodrajoko> as long as those niches aren't awful

[2023-01-06 21:02:56] <Doot0Lord> he just left
[2023-01-06 21:02:58] <bofaoyl> @uptightpanic70 i totally agree. i feel like having hanzo/widow one shot is fair cause the trade off is relatively low mobility, health and almost no sustained damage. if your widow or hanzo cant hit shots they are useless. having a high mobility character with a one shot is ass. also hog can head shot for like 280hp at the right range so if you do it right you can 1 shot torb and reaper from like 8 meters away.
[2023-01-06 21:03:01] <saddle_rocket> three games in a row with the hog counterswap ffs

[2023-01-06 21:15:38] <ilovemen561> see the reason why i stopped playing tank due to 5v5 is cuz the queue time is insane, the witch hunters are insanely hard to get away from, and nobody know how to actually heal anymore.
[2023-01-06 21:15:39] <%a_witcher> @beanieweenees77 open q is a arcade game mode and not relevant to balancing
[2023-01-06 21:15:40] <SpaceCircus_> @MartianMagic that entirely depends on the situation because you can still win games even against your counters so i would say synergies

[2023-01-06 21:21:11] <%clearqueue> these map pools are kinda dead

[2023-01-06 21:22:06] <%Waizer> @minecraftmaster125 honest answer, 1 hour or 100 hours doesn't matter. If you're having a bad run in comp... so what? People will always look to blame someone else. Comp and Qp are different so ignore the people telling you to leave and just grind and learn, but make sure you have fun

If she hits terrain at an angle she will actually slide across the terrain until the cast time is over or she is no longer blocked by the terrain.

[2023-01-06 21:55:13] <%Tazikol> @mchsraider nah, there is still a hidden mmr for qp just less acurate than comp
[2023-01-06 21:55:17] <+BetrayedFoxy> @powderdidnothingwrong Overwatch is better.

[2023-01-06 21:55:45] <%a_witcher> they need an indicator how many you hit with carnage now .. because you have to look at your cooldown icon now to see when you have it again

[2023-01-06 22:01:09] <Mauserek> @Mauserek is it separate from comp?

[2023-01-06 22:01:45] <bofaoyl> @splosh0 thats how i feel about it. it should either cleanse effects or have the invincibility but not both. maybe even a cleanse+small burst heal like baps shift or lucios amp.
[2023-01-06 22:01:47] <%Edatox_Sarenu> Axe cooldown lowers when he hits mei walls, shields, rails, monitors (like in the training range), and if you hit multiple people who have shields, then theres no cd
[2023-01-06 22:01:49] <%Tazikol> was that a brig boop ?
[2023-01-06 22:01:50] <Rob_501> Am I the only one that thinks JQ needs a buff in the healing she gets from bleeds? She still feels too squishy without a pocket imo

[2023-01-06 22:02:29] <Mauserek> @Edatox_Sarenu guess it was programmed like it counts how many entities you have hit without checking whether that entitiy is a hero or not
[2023-01-06 22:02:30] <%djzander_> @rob_501 i think this too but idk if it would be too powerful

[2023-01-06 22:03:06] <Splosh0> @bofaoyl yes i think the invincibility is what has to go. you should not be able to tp to your tank who is 1 hp and click e at your feet to save you both. very unfun and 0 brain
[2023-01-06 22:03:07] <Rob_501> Yeah don’t get me wrong I think the buffs were bad, it’s just something I always felt even before the buffs

[2023-01-06 22:03:17] <%+clownfish_of_the_cosmos> this is clearly ranked. if this was qp the other tank would go hog

[2023-01-06 22:12:31] <%TJ_0K> what I've seen for rein is just pin all over
[2023-01-06 22:12:32] <+P1exes> Does anybody even have fun in this mode?
[2023-01-06 22:12:32] <marsu5000_> widow is also so good because every one is playong phara just 1 tap
[2023-01-06 22:12:34] <%itsbiggs22> 300 is so high lol
[2023-01-06 22:12:34] <%brominn> This feels like the early event that 2 years later we look back and go "Remember that shit Greek God event?"
[2023-01-06 22:12:35] <bofaoyl> just kill the pharah /s
[2023-01-06 22:12:35] <+puttputt24_> Loooooooool
[2023-01-06 22:12:36] <%luyanami> 300 is crazy literally, it has to be 100 or 125
[2023-01-06 22:12:37] <+CapnCurt> you get a title
[2023-01-06 22:12:37] <$RaGeTW1> Blizzard showing their lack of knowledge on their own game again
[2023-01-06 22:12:39] <%+therainb0wcat03> I love how they buffed everyone and then widow is just there
[2023-01-06 22:12:42] <%Waizer> it'll only take 30 games to get 300 at this rate... easiest title ever
[2023-01-06 22:12:42] <TheCerri> Do you need 300 collectively or per hero?
[2023-01-06 22:12:43] <2simplemitchel> I got the Mercy skin and gave up. This game mode is trash lol.
[2023-01-06 22:12:46] <%Ari0n0s> Ive been enjoying lucio in this though KEKW

[2023-01-06 22:12:50] <%a_witcher> @MrDabenport one of the challenges you need to complete for the mercy skin
[2023-01-06 22:12:50] <+Rivalrun> 300 kills gets you a player title
[2023-01-06 22:12:50] <internet_crasher> omg

[2023-01-06 22:13:00] <%+nighttrainlan3> not really sure how they thought reib would be good for this mode with pharah and widow
[2023-01-06 22:13:00] <%spectreadept> Why did they think Pharah was a good idea for this mode? LUL
[2023-01-06 22:13:01] <%blueberrybench> for rein is so bad
[2023-01-06 22:13:01] <kari_sims> the grind for a recycled skin feels so disrespectful
[2023-01-06 22:13:01] <koishi_k0meiji> Just play hog and pick on the squishies?
[2023-01-06 22:13:01] <kyoka_suigetsu46> hi flats
[2023-01-06 22:13:02] <%zmagizzle> They never should have put pharah in this
[2023-01-06 22:13:02] <cjk_0221> all the squishies are able to get on high ground and the only people he can reach are tanks in which all the tanks out duel him
[2023-01-06 22:13:02] <%Stonks368> 4 pharas monkaS
[2023-01-06 22:13:04] <+sezyks> whats the title
[2023-01-06 22:13:04] <+xochino> !pc
[2023-01-06 22:13:04] <%+therainb0wcat03> You legit have to win 15 games on EACH character to get the titles… what were they thinking?
[2023-01-06 22:13:05] <%Newbasaur> they should have made rein shield deflect in this mode
[2023-01-06 22:13:05] <xavier_sck_> I gave up when I saw the challanges
[2023-01-06 22:13:07] <2simplemitchel> Phara op
[2023-01-06 22:13:08] <cjk_0221> not a balanced game mode
[2023-01-06 22:13:09] <luminar0> this mode is fun but not when u play rein lol
[2023-01-06 22:13:10] <+MyNameNafen> this mode was so overhyped
[2023-01-06 22:13:10] <%shploop_ow> it apears as if your  helping people get the title
[2023-01-06 22:13:11] <%+therainb0wcat03> This is the worse map for rein tho
[2023-01-06 22:13:14] <%Tazikol> PHARAS YEP
[2023-01-06 22:13:14] <%spectreadept> The Hades skin doesn't even make sense for her

[2023-01-06 22:13:20] <marsu5000_> 300 is actually crazy tho
[2023-01-06 22:13:20] <apotatopersona> what is rein's title for this?
[2023-01-06 22:13:22] <%jonah_ward> the best people are pharah and queen id say
[2023-01-06 22:13:22] <%+LeoMako> pharah is actually toxic in this mode
[2023-01-06 22:13:25] <internet_crasher> you need to step up your game
[2023-01-06 22:13:28] <Tenth_Shadow> I DONT KNOW WHY BLIZZARD DIDNT MAKE A GREEK SKIN FOR TORBRN AS HEPHAESTUS. NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2023-01-06 22:13:30] <+Izthatit> What would be better to carry over from this mode. Lower Charge CD or Pin Multiple people at once?
[2023-01-06 22:13:31] <%modestghost> @spectreadept you think so?

[2023-01-06 22:21:06] <Gulticent> @Gulticent I meant to say thats its more like rock, paper, scissors where some characters have advantages over other, lucio for example has the speed to move quickly on widow even if she is in her ult, a good lucio quickly quiclky move to her and stun her out of scope

[2023-01-06 22:22:46] <WabbitInvictus> This is just pain
[2023-01-06 22:22:46] <The_Zoozibble> the fact that rein can get booped in pin is so bad
[2023-01-06 22:22:46] <internet_crasher> its the pharas
[2023-01-06 22:22:48] <+Esslanotte> but hey, you get a nice title if you kill 300 enemies during your ult

[2023-01-06 22:22:52] <HexaDooD> i'm glad to see you have so much fun in this incredibly well thought out game mode!
[2023-01-06 22:22:53] <アンクルトンサン (uncletonn)> @Flats my bet is devs tried it out themselves within 1 room with beers and laughter without really trying to win then gave it us but said you have to sweat and have no friends
[2023-01-06 22:22:55] <+Pestidox> hog is also the only one with an on demand heal which is ridiculous in a mode like this
[2023-01-06 22:23:00] <Splosh0> ok but just play a different hero maybe it will be more fun
[2023-01-06 22:23:02] <TheCerri> but but but you can pin up to three people! Kappa
[2023-01-06 22:23:03] <%paleassnowx> i smell widow makers on this map

[2023-01-06 22:23:06] <%TOSwtkm> and a hog can hook pharah and lucio can boop you
[2023-01-06 22:23:07] <+Rivalrun> If it was against AI then it would be more fun imo
[2023-01-06 22:23:07] <%+therainb0wcat03> Anyway, some characters are gigabuffedand then we have rein and widow

[2023-01-06 22:24:28] <%SaintVizard> retire rein
[2023-01-06 22:24:28] <%OMNI_KreiZ> How
[2023-01-06 22:24:29] <%paleassnowx> WHY ARE THEY NOT COUNTING
[2023-01-06 22:24:30] <old_toby42069> When i played Ram in this mode, Rein almost never could successfully pin me
[2023-01-06 22:24:30] <%HypeTime99> It's because (if you remember) his pin hitbox was to big before and made people cry
[2023-01-06 22:24:31] <%+amr183> yeah that's a bug
[2023-01-06 22:24:32] <+CapnCurt> You can even hammer hit them and no cred often
[2023-01-06 22:24:35] <%Edatox_Sarenu> NO WHAT
[2023-01-06 22:24:35] <%Edatox_Sarenu> NOOOO
[2023-01-06 22:24:36] <%modestghost> NOOO
[2023-01-06 22:24:36] <%ow_sigmaeats> HUUUUUUH flatsHuh
[2023-01-06 22:24:36] <%Ari0n0s> KEKW KARMA
[2023-01-06 22:24:36] <TheCerri> Pin is fine Kappa
[2023-01-06 22:24:42] <Firetrooper_> how are mortal reins  surposed to get 500 kills?
[2023-01-06 22:24:44] <+BetrayedFoxy> @Flats It didn't give you the kill but it extended the ult duration.
[2023-01-06 22:24:44] <%$atsBrew> ThisIsFine
[2023-01-06 22:24:44] <%OMNI_KreiZ> This is the rein map
[2023-01-06 22:24:49] <thesaintsronin> Are we going for the title or just the voice line?
[2023-01-06 22:24:51] <+CapnCurt> Yeah the ram nerf in this! like huhhhh??
[2023-01-06 22:24:54] <%paleassnowx> alot of the animations in this mode are bugged i noticed
[2023-01-06 22:24:55] <marsu5000_> trolling phara KEKW
[2023-01-06 22:25:00] <%Ari0n0s> wtf she fires 3 rockets monkaX
[2023-01-06 22:25:03] <%itsbiggs22> putting fliers in this game mode is hilarious with Rein
[2023-01-06 22:25:03] <%th3r3is0nlyzuul> @thesaintsronin title
[2023-01-06 22:25:04] <+Pestidox> I think I got 8 kills as ram one game
[2023-01-06 22:25:08] <Rob_501> I think hitting them with the hammer after the ping to push them away further helps ensuring the kill
[2023-01-06 22:25:12] <%seeemaj> is funny how ram has the best title card but is probably the worst one
[2023-01-06 22:25:16] <%a_witcher> outplayed
[2023-01-06 22:25:17] <%spectreadept> They half assed the moveset of everyone in this mode. Everyone should have gotten equally crazy buffs to everything
[2023-01-06 22:25:19] <thesaintsronin> Oh
[2023-01-06 22:25:22] <+Skidzz96> They probably didnt nerf ram,mode was just made pre patch
[2023-01-06 22:25:27] <+Holyroberto> How many kills is he on?
[2023-01-06 22:25:37] <xfloleex> You guys better all be working towards the reinhardt statue
[2023-01-06 22:25:39] <aki_tari> There was no running from that
[2023-01-06 22:25:39] <%ow_sigmaeats> @flats have you ever played super smash bros melee or super smash bros ultimate
[2023-01-06 22:25:45] <%clearqueue> pin hitbox sucks ass
[2023-01-06 22:25:46] <%TOSwtkm> who does rein even counter in this gamemode?
[2023-01-06 22:25:47] <+sezyks> since you didnt get that kill he probably lost 1 for it
[2023-01-06 22:25:49] <%OMNI_KreiZ> OW make flats angry, Flats go crazy
[2023-01-06 22:25:50] <marsu5000_> @Holyroberto 9 on the top middle
[2023-01-06 22:25:52] <internet_crasher> how long are you going to play?
[2023-01-06 22:25:52] <%paleassnowx> this is a rein/lucio map for sure
[2023-01-06 22:25:54] <sungfuls> i hate this map for deathmatch
[2023-01-06 22:25:56] <Rob_501> Ramattra kinda sucks in this mode, specially with so m any hogs around
[2023-01-06 22:25:59] <%seeemaj> ramma is the worst in the gamemode
[2023-01-06 22:26:00] <%Ari0n0s> GIGACHAD  W flats though
[2023-01-06 22:26:02] <!%+Scrubbles_Ow> how does this mode work chat?
[2023-01-06 22:26:06] <%+therainb0wcat03> Rams ult is also so fucking bad
[2023-01-06 22:26:06] VIEWERS: 3 056
[2023-01-06 22:26:09] <Mixwolf851> Like his kit seems fun but then you play him and you realize it’s not fun at all
[2023-01-06 22:26:12] <Rob_501> @seeemaj agree
[2023-01-06 22:26:12] <%itsbiggs22> @Scrubbles_Ow you die
[2023-01-06 22:26:13] <fidelguevara72> ram also blows but nemi still good
[2023-01-06 22:26:14] <%$TeaHauss> MLADY scrubbles
[2023-01-06 22:26:14] <reeseyroo> i thought flats didnt like this mode
[2023-01-06 22:26:26] <A_Ducki> @Scrubbles_Ow it doesnt YEP
[2023-01-06 22:26:26] <%serginho264> @Scrubbles_Ow you die to pharrah
[2023-01-06 22:26:27] <Rob_501> Even Widowmaker feels more useful
[2023-01-06 22:26:30] <reeseyroo> why you playing
[2023-01-06 22:26:32] <reeseyroo> huh
[2023-01-06 22:26:32] <2simplemitchel> 100000% AGREED
[2023-01-06 22:26:33] <%ow_sigmaeats> Flats is just bullying
[2023-01-06 22:26:33] <+Izthatit> You farm Ult Charge from Canisters, then you roll other players with your enhanced Ult.
[2023-01-06 22:26:35] <foxyinaboxy12> same
[2023-01-06 22:26:35] <Splosh0> widow is a blast
[2023-01-06 22:26:36] <reeseyroo> ahh
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <%+amr183> AKA HOG
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <%spectreadept> Pharah is having a blast LUL
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <2simplemitchel> Massive disappointment
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <SixteenTrips> I'm sure Pharah is a blast
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <+Skidzz96> Widow is fun
[2023-01-06 22:26:39] <+Real_magikaarp> This mode is absolutely garbage compared to the last Event
[2023-01-06 22:26:40] <marsu5000_> widow is fun cause u 1 tap phara abusers
[2023-01-06 22:26:40] <+Esai_p> widow ult is very strong
[2023-01-06 22:26:41] <%sofishdekat> @Scrubbles_Ow its deathmatch and every availalbe hero has unique changes to their kit, esp while ultiing
[2023-01-06 22:26:44] <fidelguevara72> lucio
[2023-01-06 22:26:45] <ItsTheBish0p> they whiffed this being fun tdm
[2023-01-06 22:26:46] <TheDtay> jq funny asf
[2023-01-06 22:26:47] <BlitzVolfe> Vortex suck is cool and all but everybody else has hard cc or escape tools and rams like k I’ll just stand here
[2023-01-06 22:26:49] <%$atsBrew> ppCircle
[2023-01-06 22:26:49] <%paleassnowx> yeah widow/lucio/junker are way fun in this mode
[2023-01-06 22:26:51] <%+LeoMako> lucio is fun
[2023-01-06 22:26:53] <+Esai_p> JQ in this mode is poggers
[2023-01-06 22:26:55] <fidelguevara72> lucio is a blast
[2023-01-06 22:26:56] <+Izthatit> The issue is Pharah, Lucio & Widow basically dominate this mode.
[2023-01-06 22:26:59] <%fireblazewolf420> yeah this mode blows major hog Kappa
[2023-01-06 22:26:59] <internet_crasher> its the pharas that is the problem
[2023-01-06 22:27:00] <Mauserek> lucio is fun indeed
[2023-01-06 22:27:01] <%GhostshipRobot> I won my first FFA (both in this mode and first ever played) running Rein.
[2023-01-06 22:27:01] <!%+Scrubbles_Ow> @Scrubbles_Ow yeah i wasnt sure how their kits changed mainly lol
[2023-01-06 22:27:03] <TheKawaiiPandaDesu> bruh i just wanted the mercy skin this mode is booty cheeks
[2023-01-06 22:27:03] <CupcakeDono> What Title do you get?
[2023-01-06 22:27:03] <%finalfrenzy1> rein going to horizon lunar colony
[2023-01-06 22:27:04] <ChronoAura> The mode is pretty fun. Rein is good, but on certain maps & that's fine.
[2023-01-06 22:27:08] <foxyinaboxy12> it is kinda bad
[2023-01-06 22:27:10] <%Ari0n0s> LETSGO
[2023-01-06 22:27:10] <%+rowsterdc> did u see the mercy skins is a reused skin
[2023-01-06 22:27:13] <+inndi> are you going for all titles?
[2023-01-06 22:27:14] <Mauserek> even with lucio you will have problems vs widow
[2023-01-06 22:27:19] <marsu5000_> whats ia that said title
[2023-01-06 22:27:19] <%itsbiggs22> Pharah being put in is kinda a kick to the dick
[2023-01-06 22:27:19] <Jeano135> I would prefer them making more PvE events like they did with archives
[2023-01-06 22:27:19] <+sezyks> are you doing all heroes?
[2023-01-06 22:27:20] <%spectreadept> 300!?
[2023-01-06 22:27:21] <reeseyroo> thats a lot of kills
[2023-01-06 22:27:23] <%zecil42> Phara is the issue for me, others are manageable
[2023-01-06 22:27:25] <aki_tari> This is the only map rein is playable on, then?
[2023-01-06 22:27:25] <%paleassnowx> but damn you make rein look fun again
[2023-01-06 22:27:25] <Rob_501> I played a game with 3 hogs and 3 lucios today
[2023-01-06 22:27:25] <%seeemaj> ram got the best tbh
[2023-01-06 22:27:26] <Cryocian> you know Rein is in a great spot when top-fragging can still feel miserable
[2023-01-06 22:27:28] <+DiamondPolar> @Mauserek just look down
[2023-01-06 22:27:29] <%jbaby18> Whats up flats!
[2023-01-06 22:27:30] <tristigaming> I agree, this mode is doo doo, so much so that even the titles dont make up for it
[2023-01-06 22:27:30] <07pyre> @spectreadept 300 final blows
[2023-01-06 22:27:31] <%+HitokiriNyuusen> Pharah is stipid in this mode...but has the best title
[2023-01-06 22:27:31] <internet_crasher> and there is just one phara qounter
[2023-01-06 22:27:33] <%Helkazard> Rein is basically just good on colosseo and maybe Ilios
[2023-01-06 22:27:33] <Klyts> 300 kills is insane
[2023-01-06 22:27:35] <marsu5000_> @inndi id rather end my self
[2023-01-06 22:27:36] <+Chunko_Muffo> is it 300 kills or 300 ult kills?
[2023-01-06 22:27:42] <+cambray33> 300 is way to much
[2023-01-06 22:27:42] <%nightraidu> @paleassnowx literally
[2023-01-06 22:27:44] <%+HitokiriNyuusen> 300 kills
[2023-01-06 22:27:46] <+Esslanotte> 300 in the ultimate mode
[2023-01-06 22:27:46] <%spectreadept> WHAT!?
[2023-01-06 22:27:48] <%HypeTime99> HEY FLATS! just wanted to stop by and say love the stream still.
[2023-01-06 22:27:49] <%+HitokiriNyuusen> 25 ult for voice line
[2023-01-06 22:27:50] <TheCerri> lol
[2023-01-06 22:27:50] <%TOSwtkm> and the game goes to 20 kills to win chat
[2023-01-06 22:27:51] <%$atsBrew> YEP
[2023-01-06 22:27:52] <Willguy314> just win 15 times
[2023-01-06 22:27:52] <%+chicken1199> ???
[2023-01-06 22:27:55] <xfloleex> 200 or 150 would have been way enough
[2023-01-06 22:27:59] <%sofishdekat> @Scrubbles_Ow so things like lucio has unlimited ammo and if he boops someone into a wall it stuns them. Widow has a medusa passive, so if she's looking at a hero and that hero looks at them, they freeze for 1-2s
[2023-01-06 22:28:00] <Rob_501> Yeah good luck getting them 300 kills with Ram
[2023-01-06 22:28:00] <%+amr183> @Chunko_Muffo normal final blows
[2023-01-06 22:28:02] <%fireblazewolf420> pharah will be the easiest title to get
[2023-01-06 22:28:06] VIEWERS: 3 056
[2023-01-06 22:28:12] <uselesskriht> i got a lobby were we farmed everyones kills to 19 and we ended the game
[2023-01-06 22:28:13] <reeseyroo> its a pretty cool title tho
[2023-01-06 22:28:16] <!%OWGrandma> Yeah I've played like 10 games and I'm halfway there on Pharah
[2023-01-06 22:28:17] <+Esslanotte> oh normal? that's doable but still a lot
[2023-01-06 22:28:19] <tole2_> Do you know how to get the philosopher title?
[2023-01-06 22:28:21] <%paleassnowx> i got the lucio title. it was way too easy tbh
[2023-01-06 22:28:25] <%a_witcher> they want us to play this until the 19th so yeah 300
[2023-01-06 22:28:25] <%+therainb0wcat03> The thing is no one wants to play solo arcade for that long.
[2023-01-06 22:28:28] <+Izthatit> Ramattra will take approximately 100 Games to get title lol
[2023-01-06 22:28:30] <marsu5000_> i watched the new avatar today it was okay
[2023-01-06 22:28:30] <!%+Scrubbles_Ow> @Scrubbles_Ow ouuuu! rein, ram and pharah?
[2023-01-06 22:28:32] <!%OWGrandma> @tole2_ It's bonus battlepass levels
[2023-01-06 22:28:32] <@%^StreamElements> Check out Flats' YouTube channel! https://www.youtube.com/@flats_ow | Most Recent Video: How I got the Huge Rez Achievement in Overwatch 2 Competitive - https://youtu.be/AbTNXpH54IA
[2023-01-06 22:28:33] <%mchsraider> 300 kills for me would be 40 games
[2023-01-06 22:28:37] <BaddestPython28> Pharah and junker queen just run the show
[2023-01-06 22:28:38] <%+amr183> @fireblazewolf420 I got hog's title and he is the easiest since he is the most op
[2023-01-06 22:28:40] <%SonicWaveGaming1> JQ feels nice in this mode
[2023-01-06 22:28:40] <%Ari0n0s> KEKW
[2023-01-06 22:28:40] <%+therainb0wcat03> Legit I got the voice lines and will pretend the game mode doesn’t exist anymore
[2023-01-06 22:28:43] <aki_tari> unfortunate
[2023-01-06 22:28:43] <Rob_501> @tole2_ that's on level 95 of the battle pass IIRC
[2023-01-06 22:28:44] <+Pestidox> skill issue
[2023-01-06 22:28:46] <reeseyroo> i average 1 kill a game
[2023-01-06 22:28:46] <+cambray33> In this mode i either get 3 kills or i win
[2023-01-06 22:28:47] <+Holyroberto> assists should count tbh, idk why they didnt do that. 300 is too much
[2023-01-06 22:28:47] <shyjvh> also that pharah can move during her ULT is sus
[2023-01-06 22:28:50] <reeseyroo> only 300 games to go
[2023-01-06 22:28:53] <xfloleex> Technically if you manage to get a full lobby, you can just keep,
[2023-01-06 22:28:53] <%+benjiionps> i almost have the lucio title
[2023-01-06 22:28:55] <TheCerri> 300 kills for me would be about 500 games I think
[2023-01-06 22:28:55] <SixteenTrips> As a support main, Widow took me like 27
[2023-01-06 22:29:00] <marsu5000_> @BaddestPython28 also widow on ilios cause u 1 tap pharas so ez
[2023-01-06 22:29:00] <%+therainb0wcat03> @mchsraider on each character 😊
[2023-01-06 22:29:01] <sofishdekat> @Scrubbles_Ow I'm not certain on the rest of it - I think there's 7-8 heroes, I can't remember what all the different things are
[2023-01-06 22:29:07] <+DiamondPolar> JQ doesnt have her buffs from the patch notes in it :)))
[2023-01-06 22:29:13] <rowsterdc> flats is having fun
[2023-01-06 22:29:14] <xfloleex> Technically if you manage to get a full lobby, you can just keep jumping off the map to farm more elims
[2023-01-06 22:29:17] <fireblazewolf420> holy that ragdoll was so fast
[2023-01-06 22:29:21] <aki_tari> What skill issure? he's winning by 5 kills
[2023-01-06 22:29:22] <Flaptain_Jack> riiLost
[2023-01-06 22:29:27] <%+Mehhzah> I can see 300 total but per hero is nutty
[2023-01-06 22:29:28] <Splosh0> yeah widow isnt to hard in this
[2023-01-06 22:29:29] <%TOSwtkm> when everyone sees a rein they attack lol
[2023-01-06 22:29:41] <%+DxxCutter> How can rein's pin hitbox still be broken for so many years
[2023-01-06 22:29:42] <internet_crasher> what does ramattras ult do in this gamemod?
[2023-01-06 22:29:43] <caps4thewin> I’m 3 Ramatra ult kills from getting the Mercy skin
[2023-01-06 22:29:44] <jd_62q> nope

[2023-01-06 22:31:19] <uselesskriht> have u tried asking people to farm kills?
[2023-01-06 22:31:19] <%AngelFun> flatsS 300 is just so many

[2023-01-06 22:31:20] <Gulticent> On thing I hate about this game mode is how the achievements specify final blows, last night was playing the gamemode and had a game with 23 assist and 2 final blows....
[2023-01-06 22:31:21] <coumfist> is ti long to get kills in this mode or i can just one trick it
[2023-01-06 22:31:22] <%paleassnowx> they need to lower the title requirements tbh

[2023-01-06 22:48:02] <%+rowsterdc> 300 kills means that you would have to win 15 games with 20 kills, then its 7 heros, so that means you would have to win 105 as first place.
[2023-01-06 22:48:03] <%+okamiyinhe> took me 15-16...I may be a little aggressive tho lol

[2023-01-06 22:52:00] <Rob_501> Did we lose seagull?
[2023-01-06 22:52:03] <%TOSwtkm> they cant do it like old cod or other games use to and kick everyone out of the servers but naw they want to fuck you over
[2023-01-06 22:52:03] <MedusaNr1> Flat did you saw the new gamemode? it even has collectables for Rein
[2023-01-06 22:52:03] <+hotasstwink> @pandamension it depends on your mmr. some would win get +12 +24 + 33 but average gain for a win was 25 sr
[2023-01-06 22:52:06] <%itsbiggs22> QP is just comp now anyway
[2023-01-06 22:52:08] <CodesterG> I just got the bug but I didn't get a time out does that mean I still lose 50 sr?
[2023-01-06 22:52:10] <internet_crasher> its so quiet

[2023-01-06 22:52:18] <rp826> Is anyone's game acting weird?
[2023-01-06 22:52:18] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
[2023-01-06 22:52:21] <%paleassnowx> QP isnt fun. mystery heros for life

[2023-01-06 22:52:29] <TheRainbowFshy> @joyz1l yeah it can happen that you get kiked out and then ther stands applying update but the thing is when you restart the game the update wher allready applyed and because of that when you play comp youl get a penelty
[2023-01-06 22:52:33] <%blocker_17> I mean at least comp can play both sides
[2023-01-06 22:52:33] <8endrv8> My game says applying update?

[2023-01-06 22:53:28] <8endrv8> Thanks thought there was an hot fix they didn’t tell us about
[2023-01-06 22:53:29] <MackerD_> Whats up with servers?

[2023-01-06 22:53:37] <$robear91> Sorry for spam :<
[2023-01-06 22:53:38] <+ceilingenjoyer> does JQ's axe still trigger the cooldown reduction on shields?
[2023-01-06 22:53:38] <lMaryom> dude imma put music and play on the new mode cause it's getting me really crazy i hate it
[2023-01-06 22:53:43] <amcaveman> jq just mostly doesn’t stand a chance
[2023-01-06 22:53:43] <+hotasstwink> @squeezyf1 SR is skill rating. we used that in ow1 when rank was a number from 1 to 5000. now we have rank tiers that replaced sr, but we define sr as rank.
[2023-01-06 22:53:52] <enzyme43> theres an update i think
[2023-01-06 22:54:03] <TheRainbowFshy> @ceilingenjoyer no it got patched out the made a hot fix for that
