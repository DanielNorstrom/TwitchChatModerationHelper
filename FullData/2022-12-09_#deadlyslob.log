[2022-12-09 13:56:52] <+isfil> @markbart1  thats not true, rougue like exist far too long, vampire survivors only made it a bit popular
[2022-12-09 13:57:00] <cooli_can_nice> The fact that most big players went back to AOE 2 probably didn't help
[2022-12-09 13:57:00] <sdunne09> What won?
[2022-12-09 13:57:05] <+Cerenduil> Im a fan of aoe2 but man... 4 is so in Beta in terms of amount of civs.
[2022-12-09 13:57:05] <%soupdeluxe> massive fan, but im sorta lost with Hideo Kojima
[2022-12-09 13:57:11] <DagBTW> TW Warhammer 3 or AoE should have gotten it
[2022-12-09 13:57:15] <GedeonBlaze> this awards are just stupid in general
[2022-12-09 13:57:19] <claymore1m18> AOE 4 launch was really good

[2022-12-09 13:58:19] <%kermi_the_mermi> space marine 1 was awesome and i pray that 2 will be a worthy successor.
[2022-12-09 13:58:20] <claymore1m18> looks good!
[2022-12-09 13:58:30] <Omedus1337> Do people really watch the game awards for anything else besides the world premieres?
[2022-12-09 13:58:35] <+peeppuced> you should stream the first game if you get the chance

[2022-12-09 13:58:38] <%kermi_the_mermi> did u play Space marine 1 ? if no then do it on stream deadlyNice
[2022-12-09 13:58:45] <%Go6rinSrayer> The vibe is awesome but the sheer volume of lore is really daunting to a lot of people I think
[2022-12-09 13:58:50] <+Cerenduil> Nah....
[2022-12-09 13:59:01] <%soupdeluxe> any thoughts on Death Stranded 2?

[2022-12-09 14:10:19] <%Sautez_Josh> I have played more new games this year than I have in many, many years. Things I never thought to play.  Been a very interesting time learning new games and had a lot of fun.
[2022-12-09 14:10:20] <%Sl33perService> The Fighting Game Community (FGC) is it's own "hidden" gem within the gaming community. You have to experience it, but the FGC is amazing. @Deadlyslob
[2022-12-09 14:10:23] <%+g0pnik_> Amazon delivery service simulator
[2022-12-09 14:10:25] <!%Beakly_> Judas

[2022-12-09 14:10:28] <%PurpleRiboflavin> The magic shooter thing
[2022-12-09 14:10:34] <%soupdeluxe> Hideo Kojima is a genius, not many "get" his games. Its soo deep.
[2022-12-09 14:10:36] <+isfil> @Deadlyslob Remnant 2
[2022-12-09 14:10:37] <+Cerenduil> The story is the only it gets interesting but man the pacing of the gameplay its annoying
[2022-12-09 14:10:38] <%Poisonous_Oak> DS is very unique, which is quite a rare thing nowadays
[2022-12-09 14:10:38] <+r4881tm4n> did u see judas reveal looked interesting

[2022-12-09 14:10:55] <%Go6rinSrayer> Judas looked VERY Bioshock ish
[2022-12-09 14:10:55] <@%^Moobot> Sign up for the Dune: Awakening beta: https://wehy.pe/t/18/deadlyslob
[2022-12-09 14:11:02] <+Chaosshield> I didn't like Death Stranding, but I was really glad the game was made. More games need to experiment instead of being cookie cutter cinematic 3rd person rpgs or shooters
[2022-12-09 14:11:02] <%+the_dock87> @deadlyslob can always just sleep and it’ll be done cooking.
[2022-12-09 14:11:06] <V0ryn> I was surprised no Silent Hill footage

[2022-12-09 14:11:07] <+onepunchmango_> Cinematically. His game design can be questionable

[2022-12-09 14:11:49] <sdunne09> Think most of the awards are questionable at best really, like how did TLOU 2 win against Ghost of Tsushima last year for GOTY?
[2022-12-09 14:12:03] <%soupdeluxe> If you are a Hideo Kojima fan, you have to watch MGS2 retrospective on youtube from Max Derrat, its mindblowing.
[2022-12-09 14:12:17] <%hukl23> @Mossberg10 The original Metal Gear Solid on Playstation is one of my all time favorite games.

[2022-12-09 14:44:51] <%MBlack9900> Valheim has more 'realistic' structures which need to be on solid support instead of floating in the air

[2022-12-09 15:04:53] <%+Dooleyz> Absolutely 100%. However I feel like if people use it then just say thats what you do and people respect you more for it.
[2022-12-09 15:04:53] <%npc2453> Steroids literally just reduce recovery time like they are still eating and working their ass off for sure
[2022-12-09 15:04:56] <%GrndCtrl2MajTom> and it's a lifestyle. it's not just a habit.
[2022-12-09 15:05:00] <%+CaptMcAwes0me> @Beakly_ yea but look at him when we was 30 as opposed to now.  it's not possible to do what he's done w/o gear
[2022-12-09 15:05:00] <+TeflonVipers> They Don't admit to it but they don't deny it either. They just change the topic @Deadlyslob
[2022-12-09 15:05:04] <heeyysteve> bullshit not as hard...you starve yourself and work out like 3 times a day
[2022-12-09 15:05:06] <Average_jojo> they also usually only have months to get that big which would be impossible without roids
[2022-12-09 15:05:09] <Zyonito> Thet are not lazy,but hey are "cheating" his own body..and when they stop..PUFFFFFFFFFF

[2022-12-09 15:05:21] <%+treez81> They work harder actually because the gear gives them more stamina

[2022-12-09 15:06:14] <%Go6rinSrayer> Guy I worked with was an olympic level kayaker, he said to keep up with roid heads he was waking up at 1am to down 3k calories, plus eating 4 meals a  day just to have the energy to work out enough
[2022-12-09 15:06:17] <%+commandoism> @sancho_1986 because you just cant physically get any bigger without it
[2022-12-09 15:06:18] <%Giga_Bean> exactly
[2022-12-09 15:06:20] <%TheSamuelC> I think its completely fine unless you're a competing athlete in sports
[2022-12-09 15:06:21] <%+g0pnik_> @sancho_1986 because you have a genetic limit, you can go further with roids
[2022-12-09 15:06:23] <%+Desertfang77> @Deadlyslob Speakin of strength and activity... Those shoulders look pretty juiced man. Big on fitness?

[2022-12-09 15:06:39] <%+CaptMcAwes0me> @sancho_1986 because your body doesn't produce the same test, etc as it does when you're younger.  it's just not possible

[2022-12-09 16:03:08] <GoKartM0zart> there are 5-7 trader spawn points.. he will be at the first you find. So not that bad
[2022-12-09 16:03:08] <+djmadttv> Trader is always in the black forest
[2022-12-09 16:03:09] <%npc2453> The weight belt you get from the trader is sick
[2022-12-09 16:03:09] <+blondeb0nzai> hes only found in a black forest biome
[2022-12-09 16:03:10] <%+Chalkstix> trader isn't entirely random - He's in a Black Forest, and often close to one of The Elder spawnpoints
[2022-12-09 16:03:11] <+Scharlachrottt> Sell it to the merchant to buy fishing rod or fun gear. If you get close to the trader, his symbol will appear on your map at least.
[2022-12-09 16:03:12] <jpicky_> to be fair the trader is always in a certain radius of spawn

[2022-12-09 16:03:22] <%Chthonian> He has a good amount of spawn chances but once he's spawned he's the only one in the world, if that makes sense
[2022-12-09 16:03:23] <+bownamarama> hes always in the black forest. ive always found it before the second boss
[2022-12-09 16:03:25] <%+richard_b_itchy> There is a web site where it will tell you the trader location for your seed
[2022-12-09 16:03:25] <+op_freakfighter> There's a website that will generate the map of your entire world by entering your seed number.
[2022-12-09 16:03:53] <%$DADwithoutunderscores> @op_freakfighter where's the fun in that

[2022-12-09 18:07:37] <@%Mossberg10> Server Meshing POGGERS
[2022-12-09 18:07:40] <%Warcazem> 1000 players. Oooo launch day...
[2022-12-09 18:07:40] <%+hobohias> conan is from the same studio
[2022-12-09 18:07:42] <%+cprime420> DuneZ
[2022-12-09 18:07:43] <Roberto_The_Robot> sending hundreds of clones of duncan to die in my name?
[2022-12-09 18:07:44] <totally_immersed> its a reskin of ark lol
[2022-12-09 18:07:44] <%+yeezusmaybe> @deadlyslob are you a fan of the books?
[2022-12-09 18:07:45] <%+Mr_Implicit> So its about worms
[2022-12-09 18:07:48] <%SnickersBandit> sounds like lots of griefing
[2022-12-09 18:07:53] <maguatoo> @maguatoo I'm on the fence,..I really would love to pick up the expansion, but I think I need to get another year of play into Ix
[2022-12-09 18:07:56] <Blipsit> server mesh you say?
[2022-12-09 18:08:00] <%kermi_the_mermi> griefing paradies
[2022-12-09 18:08:00] <Dragonlord54> foxhole is also really dope if you never played it
[2022-12-09 18:08:02] <+0gwizard> @drazion still play swgemu form time to time
[2022-12-09 18:08:03] <%+Bpwoods> Gross. I hate how every new game these days is some pvp game tbh. Give single player story games pls
[2022-12-09 18:08:07] <%+Chalkstix> could be a smuggler outpost
[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <%+Overcast22> Hmmm
[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <+TopPopSP> thoptorcoptor
[2022-12-09 18:08:12] <%SnickersBandit> server meshing? Someone tell Chris Roberts
[2022-12-09 18:08:12] <%+Chalkstix> orni thopter
[2022-12-09 18:08:14] <GoKartM0zart> @SnickersBandit agreed... hence why I'd play hosted server... not 1000s survival MMO
[2022-12-09 18:08:14] <Madmikos> ooh spice harvesting wars? Sounds like Planetside (the first one)
[2022-12-09 18:08:18] <%+afpops> How could they waste so much water on the plants. The people will not be happy.
[2022-12-09 18:08:21] <+ahdamn930> sounds like new world
[2022-12-09 18:08:27] <!%+Duderamus> same
[2022-12-09 18:08:30] <%npc2453> immediately overrun by the no lives tbh
[2022-12-09 18:08:34] <%+rodic87> @ahdamn930 that actually probably is closer to reality
[2022-12-09 18:08:37] <%alex_in_stl> bases cause stability issues on DayZ modded servers
[2022-12-09 18:08:37] <InertiaCreep> new world isnt a survival game

[2022-12-09 18:10:12] <%$DADwithoutunderscores> The adrenaline of defending your base while you're actually on is awesome, but getting offlined is miserable
[2022-12-09 18:10:20] <EzGatrick> Im sensing a dig at Rust lmao
[2022-12-09 18:10:23] <%Drazion> @0gwizard never got into the private servers, but man that was such an awesome experience back in the day for sure, at least before NG
[2022-12-09 18:10:39] <%+moto187> Hope it’s not a rust remake

[2022-12-09 18:10:54] <%+Chalkstix> hopefully the world is huge
[2022-12-09 18:11:10] <%$DADwithoutunderscores> @moto187 this looks nothing like rust LUL
[2022-12-09 18:11:11] <+SemperGumby8> spice events?
[2022-12-09 18:11:13] <Ronybeth53> I can't with the flappy wings LUL
[2022-12-09 18:11:18] <giottoMKD> like you do in the univers, you drop the harvesters, get them out before the worm comes
[2022-12-09 18:11:18] <@%^Moobot> Hello consumer of awesome streams. Did you know that if you are an Amazon Prime member you can link you twitch account and get 1.....YES 1....free sub for a month to a streamer of you choice? So you know what to do: https://www.twitch.tv/prime
[2022-12-09 18:11:20] <+0gwizard> @drazion the best game ever imo.
[2022-12-09 18:11:20] <+ShieldWolf34> an ad during an ad lol ad seption!
[2022-12-09 18:11:21] <%red_leader1192> I always worry they'll be an ark clone Susge
[2022-12-09 18:11:22] <BluecidDream> damn spice addicts
[2022-12-09 18:11:22] <Dreddfull> it looks kinda cool
[2022-12-09 18:11:24] <%+JDsplice> maybe worm is machanic so players don't camp the same spot for too long
[2022-12-09 18:11:25] <%soupdeluxe> Not a fan of the cycle like graphics
[2022-12-09 18:11:25] <%Drazion> @0gwizard yeah man, 100%
[2022-12-09 18:11:25] <%+afpops> Do you think the player character is peeing in the suit when we see him?
[2022-12-09 18:11:25] <@%Mossberg10> who develops the Game? @Deadlyslob
[2022-12-09 18:11:27] <InertiaCreep> yer flappy wings makes no sense
[2022-12-09 18:11:27] <%$DADwithoutunderscores> @ShieldWolf34 welcome to the modern world
[2022-12-09 18:11:43] <Roberto_The_Robot> if it IS a cinematic its one of those WOW "lets fly together through the land" types
[2022-12-09 18:11:46] <+SemperGumby8> conan
[2022-12-09 18:11:47] <%+JDsplice> what engine?
