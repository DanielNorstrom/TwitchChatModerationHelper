[2023-01-07 12:18:07] <bunglinglummox> In the advanced worldgen you can affect how prevalent they are... but that can mess with your civ count since e.g. dwarf civs never colonise evil or good areas in worldgen.

[2023-01-07 12:19:58] <$ExtraBanal> @mileo_inc Hematite and magnetite are both just different forms of Iron differing by how much oxygen is bonded to them.
[2023-01-07 12:20:08] <bunglinglummox> @Draknic my last fort had a necromancer in the first migrant wave, I had to burrow him underground to stop him causing apocalypses every time there was a siege

[2023-01-07 14:52:59] <Neoderzweite> Maybe every squad member needs an armor stand and weapon rack for themselves?

[2023-01-07 14:56:17] <Quitutatur> Digging faster is purely based on their own skills at mining if i remember right
[2023-01-07 14:57:36] <%FinalCipher> higher quality pickaxes will do more damage in combat though

[2023-01-07 14:58:49] <Seve82> oh nice my named dorf would make fine addition to crossbow squad when/if you form one
[2023-01-07 14:58:57] <%FinalCipher> dwarves also like wielding nice things
[2023-01-07 14:59:29] <Neoderzweite> from my current fortress i can assure that a miner with a copper pickaxe is absolutely able to kill a swallowman in the caverns with a single strike. This game is weird
[2023-01-07 14:59:30] <verajonson> LUL  making ranged squads i have found is a real pain

[2023-01-07 15:00:08] <McMarschall> that is possible I believe monkaW
[2023-01-07 15:00:14] <Quitutatur> Really? ranged squads are pretty easy but training them would be easier to just ask them to kill all flying stuff you have around the map
[2023-01-07 15:00:24] <@TheKneecapKnabber> they do that ceriNOD
[2023-01-07 15:00:29] <McMarschall> yes, general work orders are superior in my experience rooC
[2023-01-07 15:00:31] <%FinalCipher> @Quitutatur except for tengus obviously
[2023-01-07 15:00:48] <Quitutatur> Gotta stop the government drones from spying in our dwarves
[2023-01-07 15:01:27] <%FinalCipher> actually there's a thought... if you shopped around savage biomes in various world gens you might be able to find a start near some crow men
[2023-01-07 15:01:45] VIEWERS: 268
[2023-01-07 15:02:02] <Neoderzweite> In the caverns you can find swallowmen
[2023-01-07 15:02:05] <%FinalCipher> there are crow men in some worlds but not others, it's random
[2023-01-07 15:02:11] <%FinalCipher> @Neoderzweite sus name tbh
[2023-01-07 15:02:18] <Neoderzweite> i know
[2023-01-07 15:02:29] <Neoderzweite> Swallowwomen also are a sus name
[2023-01-07 15:02:38] <McMarschall> the thing I have a problem with atm are Weredonkeys, yes you read that right rooKek
[2023-01-07 15:03:00] <%FinalCipher> there are also giant crows, but no giant crow men afaik
[2023-01-07 15:03:09] <McMarschall> they are terrifying monkaW
[2023-01-07 15:03:11] <Quitutatur> gotta make a "friendship" hospital when dealing with were
[2023-01-07 15:03:20] <Neoderzweite> i haven't run into werebeasts yet but i kinda wanna see some

[2023-01-07 15:04:03] <Neoderzweite> If we were talking about Rimworld i would say a friendship hospital is an organ harvest mkaySmile
[2023-01-07 15:04:18] <Quitutatur> individual rooms lined into a row with peepholes carved into the walls behind it along with a corridor where "friendly" Crossbow dwarves train their friendship
[2023-01-07 15:04:53] <McMarschall> rooThink but how do you see who is infected before its too late?
[2023-01-07 15:05:02] <Neoderzweite> But how do you get the were beast into the hospital?
[2023-01-07 15:05:14] <Quitutatur> everyone is infected the moment they touched the creature in my eyes
[2023-01-07 15:05:27] <%$MyrkDomolith> @McMarschall Take a look at the combat logs, see who was bitten. Specifically bitten.
[2023-01-07 15:05:43] <McMarschall> Quitutatur then that fort is lost, I had one of them go off in my tavern rooScream nyoo

[2023-01-07 15:06:03] <Quitutatur> if they don't turn... its a individual room so they can just be unforbidden

[2023-01-07 15:06:45] <McMarschall> cave entrances need to be trapped in my experience rooF
[2023-01-07 15:07:14] <Quitutatur> Forbidden doors will also stop werecreatures from leaving so you can trap them inside those individual hospital rooms
[2023-01-07 15:07:27] <McMarschall> I personally am a fan of large serrated steel disks and giant steel axeblades rooH
