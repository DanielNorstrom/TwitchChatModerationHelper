[2022-12-10 17:03:00] <@%Asimovuk> i think the hit reg fix is gonna be moving over to unreal engine 5 and using better servers
[2022-12-10 17:03:03] <%$chknwyng> Us servers can be slow, slowest is controllers only servers
[2022-12-10 17:03:04] <Thriefos> hit reg will never be fixed it will always be an issue

[2022-12-10 17:04:05] <Thriefos> but agreed on uniqueness of SoT
[2022-12-10 17:04:17] <%+conor_v> @ComputerNerd SoT probably has the most movement packets out of all games, your ship is constantly going up and down on the waves, and that is probably the primary issue
[2022-12-10 17:04:27] <TWO_DEEEE> gta online has boats, cars, jets, planes, npc traffic, cops, and players LOL way more than SOT tbh

[2022-12-10 17:05:06] <ComputerNerd> @ComputerNerd Exactly. They would have to make the waves more predictable to make any progress on that issue.
[2022-12-10 17:05:22] <shhhGGnoob> Hitreg happens even on islands

[2022-12-10 17:06:13] <ComputerNerd> shhhGGnoob and the Islands are in water. It's always part of the calculations to figure out if you're in water or on land
[2022-12-10 17:06:23] <%$chknwyng> Truly
[2022-12-10 17:06:27] <ComputerNerd> The server keeps track of all movements on the whole server.
[2022-12-10 17:06:39] <ComputerNerd> A ship on the other side of the map can cause lag for everybody else.
[2022-12-10 17:06:40] <bloo_shieldtoad> why dont they just press the fix-hitreg-button?

[2022-12-10 17:07:10] <%+conor_v> I would love for them to open-source the server code for SoT, could get some community progress going

[2022-12-10 17:07:41] <bloo_shieldtoad> @chknwyng same bro
[2022-12-10 17:07:56] <chemco> Blunderbomb-Reg./Sword-Reg./Pistol-Reg./Missing Ammo Box Promt-Reg./Any Reg. you want,We got it this update..."COME ON DOWN"  -Rare
[2022-12-10 17:07:57] <%+joshyoatcakes> Yeah the time thing needs to be removed...
[2022-12-10 17:08:06] <%$chknwyng> Doing both, level one up 10 then go to the other
[2022-12-10 17:08:30] <%$WilhelmRyghts> truth is, i stole all the "Fix the game" buttons from Rare HQ
[2022-12-10 17:08:34] <TWO_DEEEE> Rare just isnt a company that releases a PVP games yearly, they are a small studio, its more than just the waves, there are bigger games with way more going on with good hitreg, this is just rares first rodeo tech
[2022-12-10 17:08:52] <%$chknwyng> Reapers at 15, a ton harder than Athena
[2022-12-10 17:08:53] <Thriefos> i think sloop knockback nerf got reverted i'm being sent to space by chainshots
[2022-12-10 17:09:32] <%+conor_v> also, most games wait for the server to respond with a hit detection before rendering the hit-marker, SoT just renders the hit-marker when it hits client-side, hence it looks like hit registration is a much larger issue on SoT
[2022-12-10 17:09:35] <%+conor_v> yet it isn't
[2022-12-10 17:09:43] <%$chknwyng> So We’ll see a fox by 2024
[2022-12-10 17:09:52] <%$chknwyng> Look at fb tons of feedback lol
[2022-12-10 17:09:56] <TWO_DEEEE> if theres ever a SOT2, hitreg probably wont be fixed til then tbh, they probably would have to rewrite the whole game with hitreg in mind

[2022-12-10 17:10:31] <DonGrafiti> csgo had something like that
[2022-12-10 17:10:35] <%$4ngeloc> BF4 had a simillar tick rate thing
[2022-12-10 17:10:43] <%+Haloman369> csgo did it
[2022-12-10 17:11:01] <ComputerNerd> More ticks per second means more server CPU usage. Which means that the CPU is more likely to not finish in time for the next tick and can miss ticks
[2022-12-10 17:11:01] <TWO_DEEEE> Battlefield for YEARS, had server side lag, youd always die late behind cover, they didnt fix it til the end of battlefield 4s life span
[2022-12-10 17:11:08] <@%^Nightbot> Fancy yourself a hat or a T-shirt? 🧢  Check out Beard's merch shop here: https://www.shopbeardageddon.com
[2022-12-10 17:11:28] <ComputerNerd> Increasing tick rate means the CPU has to do more work.
[2022-12-10 17:11:29] <%$chknwyng> I mean I heard trinkets are messing up servers as well
[2022-12-10 17:11:29] <%+Faceless_2293> another thing with hitreg as far as I can understand is that the bullets are projectiles and sometimes if projectiles move too fast their detection can be a bit iffy. At least in unity, not sure about unreal
[2022-12-10 17:11:44] <%$4ngeloc> LUL
[2022-12-10 17:11:46] <%$chknwyng> I liked it
[2022-12-10 17:11:47] <%+Capren12> Changing the tick rate doesn’t always help. I changed the tick rate on my clock and it’s always ahead of time Kappa
[2022-12-10 17:11:56] <ComputerNerd> Aye, CPU and cache usage on the server side.
[2022-12-10 17:11:56] <%$chknwyng> Lol

[2022-12-10 17:12:10] <%+Capren12> LUL
[2022-12-10 17:12:13] <defalt0025> Tick rate is low when off the ship, when you are on your ship tick rate increases so you don't get as much hitreg.  This got proven 2 years back when someone intercepted the packets it sends to the network.
[2022-12-10 17:12:33] <HEaDbAnDhIgH> i bet half the people complaining just have shit hardware :P i hear so many xbox complainers ha
[2022-12-10 17:12:33] <ItZ_Miles> BF4 is so fun until you go against someone who hasnt stopped flying helis or planes for 6 years YEPP
[2022-12-10 17:12:36] <%$chknwyng> Good point defalt
[2022-12-10 17:12:53] <TWO_DEEEE> battlefield 4 to me was there last amazing battlefield game, battlefield 1 was alright but in the begining it lacked content
[2022-12-10 17:12:57] <ComputerNerd> Server tick rate doesn't have a big influence on the client's CPU usage. You'll get more updates from the server over any given unit of time but the client has less work to do than the server.
[2022-12-10 17:13:01] <Thriefos> @defalt0025 that doesnt make sense to me
[2022-12-10 17:13:15] <CynicalSly> classykCHEERS
[2022-12-10 17:13:19] <%+Faceless_2293> I swear rare said ages ago that they were gonna test out hitscan on insider but I don't play insider so idk if that happened or not
[2022-12-10 17:13:19] <%$4ngeloc> @TWO_DEEEE true, the last one that came out was a shame
[2022-12-10 17:13:31] <CynicalSly> i love it
[2022-12-10 17:13:35] <%+luis_cvn> do you think they will stop supporting xbox one?
[2022-12-10 17:13:41] <defalt0025> Yes sir, I think the main issue with hitreg is the distance between everyones clients, and servers not being able to send the data fast enough.  It will be fixed someday however its hard across a nested network :(
[2022-12-10 17:13:44] <ComputerNerd> Virtual machines are "paravirtualized", they run on actual hardware but they share it with other virtual machines.
[2022-12-10 17:14:04] <TWO_DEEEE> battlefield 3 had the best dogtags in the whole series
[2022-12-10 17:14:06] <%+Capren12> They should eventually stop supporting Xbox one but so many people still have them it’s not fair
[2022-12-10 17:14:35] <defalt0025> I wish I wasn't a software engineer lol its a whole big headache :(
[2022-12-10 17:14:41] <%+Faceless_2293> capren the game is built around xbox one though, so there would be no point stopping support
[2022-12-10 17:14:41] <$xWRETCHEDx> thats sucks, all those supps too
[2022-12-10 17:14:42] <%+Capren12> Try it again
[2022-12-10 17:14:46] <%+Faceless_2293> not in the near future anyway
[2022-12-10 17:14:47] <Bluemanchew> ive probably asked this before, but do people in your discord ever do the glitter beard easter egg? its the last thing i need for legend of the sea
[2022-12-10 17:14:49] <%+Capren12> It did the same for me and then it worked

[2022-12-10 17:15:15] <%+CaptainJukeman> How goes the sailing Beard?
[2022-12-10 17:15:24] <%+Faceless_2293> if you drop and reraise the hourglass then it usually fixes it

[2022-12-10 17:15:41] <+ShakeNTaake> Time to get on the next gen consoles folks
[2022-12-10 17:15:54] <%+Capren12> It’s still playable on last gen consoles. Unless they start becoming detrimental to the progress of the game I don’t think they should drop them
[2022-12-10 17:15:54] <defalt0025> @Capren12 From what I know, big changes come next year and the first xbox console might be getting dropped from support or it will have no future updates, the games health is more important than people without outdated hardware.

[2022-12-10 20:05:57] <%kellyshmo> That fire strat works well for double gunners because it always makes my guns super constipated
[2022-12-10 20:05:57] <dj111531> I left once because guy was spawn caming me for 30 mins and fixing my boat so that would suck

[2022-12-10 20:06:24] <%kellyshmo> in my experience, yes
[2022-12-10 20:06:35] <%kellyshmo> the roar causes extra desync on top of that

[2022-12-10 20:08:57] <+DelirusHex> because random sailing means random things can happen. waiting beneath the waves for a fight is boring
[2022-12-10 20:08:58] <@%agitatedsquid> every stream is just homogeneous now so i have to go to streams for people's personalities instead Kappa

[2022-12-10 20:11:30] <+hamster4sale> The matchmaking system is an AI that wants to make certain crews meet over and over again and become friends
[2022-12-10 20:11:36] <EmpereurRandy> Do you know France best country
[2022-12-10 20:11:39] <fifapanda_dylan> Is there something with hourglass matchmaking?
[2022-12-10 20:11:45] <Kobeans> no argentina won
[2022-12-10 20:11:50] <ManLikeRusko> well done guys you got LD talking about football
[2022-12-10 20:11:50] <Connorific> without a VPN or a US friend, is it possible to get on a US server as an EU?
[2022-12-10 20:11:56] <x43combul> Quick question for you, how do you stock up so much, and gain all the cannon balls in such bulk
[2022-12-10 20:11:57] <QjMiGlavata> argentina won the penalties
[2022-12-10 20:11:57] <%kellyshmo> I understand the application of the lore, but it would help answer a lot of the queue issues, mmr issues, same match issues

[2022-12-10 20:12:11] <%Troyduck> Do you know if the server is full can you still get invaded? I mean only one boat can stay on the server, so why not?
[2022-12-10 20:12:12] <%DoozyDomo> I heard someone saying that it seems to prioritize attackers v attackers, instead of attackers v defenders. do you or LD know anything about that?
[2022-12-10 20:12:31] <%Vupzy23> Its not possible to get on other location servers without vpn or friend from different locations
[2022-12-10 20:12:46] <fifapanda_dylan> Is there there something wrong with matchmaking right now. Sorry 😂
[2022-12-10 20:12:53] <GrotTrot> Quick maths
[2022-12-10 20:13:09] <%kellyshmo> or a cool friend!
[2022-12-10 20:13:14] <+DelirusHex> that would explain why they never raised the server cap back to 6 ships

[2022-12-10 20:13:24] <fifapanda_dylan> I’ve been in a sloop wait time for like 20 mins😭
[2022-12-10 20:13:27] <%+Capren12> Id love to do like a proper interview with rare and get a proper in-depth technical look into all of this to get the answers to questions like this LUL
[2022-12-10 20:13:35] <%+Rexactor> @Beardageddon if I vote on Hourglass and won't dive, it means that I will be invaded? As I'm sailing already for 1.5h and still noone invaded me

[2022-12-10 20:13:39] <%BadBobier> is there option to kik someone out of my sloop. i get sunk more troll than enemy ship...
[2022-12-10 20:13:59] <%Vupzy23> I can tell the difference between when you play on your own servers compared to someone else’s servers. Either that or your tipsy. Your movement is a bit different
[2022-12-10 20:14:03] <fifapanda_dylan> We already lowered once tho
[2022-12-10 20:14:15] <icycnote> Lol
[2022-12-10 20:14:19] <%TexasRucker> Some people astound me.
[2022-12-10 20:14:25] <fleyevision> could it be that there are just les players in the same bracket  in terms of win losses. so the more wins the lower the player pool ?
[2022-12-10 20:14:29] <%+Capren12> Ive had 0 problems with the queues and I feel lucky LUL
[2022-12-10 20:14:41] <%TexasRucker> Those are the types that call tech support and just need a reboot.
[2022-12-10 20:14:46] <%kellyshmo> Lower and reraise the hourglass?
[2022-12-10 20:14:59] <+Viscount_Xander> SoT Tech Support w/ Beard XD
[2022-12-10 20:15:13] <%kellyshmo> I have been wondering if the queues are reflective of like, 5-10 minutes prior
[2022-12-10 20:15:16] <icycnote> Reaper is def quicker
[2022-12-10 20:15:19] <fifapanda_dylan> Gotcha I’ll try switchijg
[2022-12-10 20:15:22] <%Vupzy23> More people are trying to go for Ghost Curse/Mysterious stranger stuff. So reapers always has faster que times
[2022-12-10 20:15:32] <@%agitatedsquid> it's probably just a placebo
[2022-12-10 20:15:43] <@%agitatedsquid> the time it takes you to go and lower and reraise just makes the queue move along more
[2022-12-10 20:16:01] <%DoozyDomo> honestly, i just reset the matchmaking w/o lowering and it seems to fix it fine
[2022-12-10 20:16:05] <+Whisp0012> "Have you tried turning your hourglass off and on again Sir"
[2022-12-10 20:16:09] <%+GTFOeefan> I asked them the spawn of the shrouded ghost and they said they couldnt tell me
[2022-12-10 20:16:17] <%Vupzy23> LOL
[2022-12-10 20:16:22] <%kellyshmo> Last night we saw Reaper at 10+ min and Athena at 1-2. After supping, it was flipped. I think people are switching or voting for one or the other.
[2022-12-10 20:16:40] <+Viscount_Xander> That was specific enough to make me think that you might have actually done that lol
[2022-12-10 20:16:48] <%kellyshmo> load into cannon having your teammate load in before you can for example
[2022-12-10 20:16:49] <GrotTrot> I wonder if there should be a faction that can fight anyone even their own faction. It could reduce queu times
[2022-12-10 20:17:10] <%Vupzy23> Or having to kill yourself when you spawn in dead
[2022-12-10 20:17:14] <GrotTrot> GOOOOAAAAL

[2022-12-10 20:28:38] <%Vupzy23> boxy fishing off stream is such a weird thing for me to hear.
[2022-12-10 20:28:39] <@%+DJPhoenixUK> people are toxic when you dont do what they want you to, pve players get toxic when pvp tries to disturb them, pvp players get toxic when pve players wont engage in pvp, one isn't worse than the other, they are just different playstyles. The reason you dont get toxic players in this season so much is because the pvpers WANT top PVP
[2022-12-10 20:28:39] <%+Majin_Bosko> I put them out on tuesday..but they will be picked up on wednesday ;)

[2022-12-10 21:03:15] <@%^Nightbot> Fancy yourself a hat or a T-shirt? 🧢  Check out Beard's merch shop here: https://www.shopbeardageddon.com
[2022-12-10 21:03:29] <Thriefos> @LivingPiiranha just make it 1 hit all the time problem fixed
[2022-12-10 21:03:30] <%$WilhelmRyghts> you wanna see a good fight people? https://clips.twitch.tv/SparklingHomelyDonkeyDatBoi-QwzTKFQjqbSROVIN
[2022-12-10 21:03:33] <!%kry10> Beard do you plan on getting Obi to leave a mince pie for santa and a carrot for rudolf at Christmas ?
[2022-12-10 21:03:35] <%mezza23247> @livingpiiranha couldn’t agree more. Honestly it needs a buff, sword too
[2022-12-10 21:04:03] <!%kry10> Excellent
[2022-12-10 21:04:07] <!%kry10> It’s the best
[2022-12-10 21:04:14] <+LivingPiiranha> @Thriefos Honestly I could get behind that. Im tired of it not one shotting people for me at point blank ranges
[2022-12-10 21:04:14] <devilarm247> nah one shots have no place in this game
[2022-12-10 21:04:22] <GrotTrot> Can we play Secret Santa?
[2022-12-10 21:04:28] <Thriefos> @LivingPiiranha i never one shot and always get oneshotted LUL
[2022-12-10 21:04:41] <+LivingPiiranha> Agreed. So tired of losing fights to it
[2022-12-10 21:04:45] <%kellyshmo> Smugglers spawn is dog cheeks
[2022-12-10 21:04:58] <Thriefos> @devilarm247 what do you like more dont one shot and get oneshotted .. or make it consistent
[2022-12-10 21:05:25] <%hereticc> best blundy take ive heard
[2022-12-10 21:05:25] <$Tyverus89> the blunder is inconsistent, that's my main gripe with it
[2022-12-10 21:05:28] <Thriefos> i prefer consistency than get screwed over by rng 99% of the time
[2022-12-10 21:05:46] <+LivingPiiranha> If it didnt one shot it might actually encourage people to use swords in my pirate game.
[2022-12-10 21:05:54] <jarodadams07> no fps game that everything is balanced
[2022-12-10 21:05:58] <+sirwaltonofsmeg> sup beard
[2022-12-10 21:06:04] <%+Nightfire255> The blunder just needs to be fixed and made consistent. When I shoot mine first, I shouldn't be the one laying there dead. lol
[2022-12-10 21:06:09] <+sirwaltonofsmeg> need a distract from england
[2022-12-10 21:06:22] <+666CBass> I hate getting smacked when I’m a fresh spawn. It’s like a slap in the face for no reason
[2022-12-10 21:06:24] <drewzki__> beard how would you feel about being able to use 2 guns and a sword?
[2022-12-10 21:06:29] <!%kry10> I call the Blunder the INWFB which stands for, It Never Works For Beardageddon
[2022-12-10 21:06:38] <jarodadams07> agree 100
[2022-12-10 21:06:42] <%$WilhelmRyghts> Ramming is a valid strat
[2022-12-10 21:06:43] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> They should add Shivs
[2022-12-10 21:06:51] <%+luis_cvn> did you complete the new adventure? thought it was boring
[2022-12-10 21:06:53] <%Vupzy23> Spawn camping not valid strat tho cause you get yellow bearded I believe
[2022-12-10 21:06:55] <@%+DJPhoenixUK> as i said earlier, people get penis-y when you dont play the way they want you to play
[2022-12-10 21:07:01] <%kellyshmo> I like a dagger that's a throwing knife
[2022-12-10 21:07:02] <drewzki__> sounds like fun lol
[2022-12-10 21:07:03] <Thriefos> then you get banned by mass report for ''spawncamping'' Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:07:03] <%$WilhelmRyghts> imagine dual wielding swords
[2022-12-10 21:07:07] <+LivingPiiranha> That's fair. It doesnt bother me to much but I would like more people to sword fight. Not like Im gonna stop playing over it though
[2022-12-10 21:07:11] <%+Falkentavio> Do not forget, aliances are a valid way to play
[2022-12-10 21:07:18] <Terpot_Ryhar> is the carry limit of 5 blunderbombs maybe too much?
[2022-12-10 21:07:21] <%DoozyDomo> I was thinking about the sword, pistol, and a third weapon of choice, but yeah weapons would need a rebalance for that
[2022-12-10 21:07:38] <defalt0025> we have this debate everyday, i wish people would get over it :(
[2022-12-10 21:07:57] <%mezza23247> Lol will ever happen @defalt0025
[2022-12-10 21:08:00] <defalt0025> 'ooo I got spawn camped let me go cry about it on the internets' lol
[2022-12-10 21:08:02] <%mezza23247> Never *
[2022-12-10 21:08:12] <Ceniter> also, if you try to spawncamp you are giving the other ship a chance to recover
[2022-12-10 21:08:22] <!%kry10> @sirwaltonofsmeg I recognise a RD connection there
[2022-12-10 21:08:24] <defalt0025> yeah man i get you lol its all jokes init
[2022-12-10 21:08:25] <cptn_deadface> Beard good day sir
[2022-12-10 21:08:38] <cptn_deadface> how r u
[2022-12-10 21:08:39] <%Vupzy23> We need boarding axes.
[2022-12-10 21:08:39] <%$WilhelmRyghts> non scoped flintlock rifle with a bayonet
[2022-12-10 21:08:42] <%kellyshmo> What do you mean? I think all of the weapons work perfectly all of the time
[2022-12-10 21:08:42] <@%+Raeeyore> Beard..... spoilers!
[2022-12-10 21:08:47] <+bttredwolf> What combination of weapons is the best for u?
[2022-12-10 21:08:47] <jari______> minigun
[2022-12-10 21:08:48] <@%+Raeeyore> sheeesssssssshhh
[2022-12-10 21:08:50] <Ceniter> double daggers would be amazing
[2022-12-10 21:08:54] <+LivingPiiranha> Why cant we customize our harpoons yet? I feel like they need skins as well. Thoughts? @Beardageddon
[2022-12-10 21:08:54] <%Bunny_VIB> Breaking NDA Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:08:58] <vekettaja> Ahoy there Beard!
[2022-12-10 21:08:58] <%DoozyDomo> wait, weapons are supposed to work properly? Kappa legcRared
[2022-12-10 21:09:04] <+Gyiir> Too much scope creep and power creep on weapons probably isnt good for the game.
[2022-12-10 21:09:10] <@%+DJPhoenixUK> beard breaking nda AGAIN
[2022-12-10 21:09:14] <%kellyshmo> I've never had a problem with a gun not shooting or shots not registering??
[2022-12-10 21:09:18] <%5YBREN> Customizable ship compass would be big
[2022-12-10 21:09:18] <theTooz> I'd love some kind of vehicles like a limited use glider or some kind of submarine lol
[2022-12-10 21:09:22] <%+lulucho_l> Im pretty sure the helicopter is NDA beard
[2022-12-10 21:09:32] <Thriefos> game where 99% of progress are cosmetics ... 99% cosmetics are ugly LUL
[2022-12-10 21:09:32] <%+Nightfire255> LUL
[2022-12-10 21:09:38] <Terpot_Ryhar> how about a portable cannon Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:09:38] <cptn_deadface> last day of work tomorrow and im off for a month
[2022-12-10 21:09:38] <FearlessJake> Cannonball bazookas too?
[2022-12-10 21:09:40] <drewzki__> shes cant help but look up
[2022-12-10 21:09:40] <Friendly_Llama> I think consistency would go a long way towards making combat feel better. Like the blunder having a specific spray pattern. Fixing swords hitting through block, etc.
[2022-12-10 21:09:47] <HyadesSong> Flares were added to pre-empt the heat-seaking missile update
[2022-12-10 21:09:52] <%Vupzy23> I think she was really enjoying you sitting on her face

[2022-12-10 21:11:09] <%$Iceantia> it is more realistic as those types of weapon wouldn't work perfectly all the time. especially with all that swimming
[2022-12-10 21:11:11] <Thriefos> i got one blundered ten times in one fight ... meanwhile i landed multiple blunder shots close range ads and never got one LUL
