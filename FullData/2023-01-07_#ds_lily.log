[2023-01-07 00:01:40] <%+Deitrlch> Lily is from South Dakota and has cleverly concealed her mid-western twang with american western english. Which is a further ruse to hide her english accent.
[2023-01-07 00:01:42] <%+TheMindTerrorist> If Lily was Scottish we all would be wondering what she's saying 50% of the time, would be hilarious
[2023-01-07 00:01:43] [Notification] rand0mn0te subscribed with Prime.
[2023-01-07 00:01:47] <%+Deitrlch> It was a false flag all along

[2023-01-07 00:02:37] <TheBestJoe> @KumbhaGarner what makes you think you could get enough points for that?
[2023-01-07 00:02:39] <Zarixis> actually, in the business world, we use american english instead of british english, as most people understand it better. I guess it's the most used english worldwide now

[2023-01-07 23:46:59] <+Dertadorlp> @Inharm way more target-farmable than anything else for ssf tho
[2023-01-07 23:47:02] <%Nite01> yeah but what about the beast needed for it, is it "common" enough ?
[2023-01-07 23:47:22] <+ProfessionalAtWorkHere> yo if its the watcher's eye and we take it from him, is he still the watcher?
[2023-01-07 23:47:23] <+Dertadorlp> it's not that crazy rare iirc, it goes for like a div in trade
