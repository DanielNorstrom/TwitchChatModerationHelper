[2023-01-08 17:11:19] <%ZerephTheFirst> It allows you to make monthly contributions to a person and usually there are rewards associated with each tier
[2023-01-08 17:11:32] <mushieboipan> it kinda helps the creator and in return you get something back in return on the tiers you buy
[2023-01-08 17:11:36] <%$couchtyp> you give money, creators post content - it can be either a flat subscription/month or you can pay 'per post'
[2023-01-08 17:11:49] <mushieboipan> oooo

[2023-01-08 17:25:58] <%$couchtyp> Clip Studio makers are still offering a one time payment option - and currently with a free upgrade for Clip Studio Paint V2 which will be released sometime this year - but yes, they're also offering a $0.99/month subscription now
[2023-01-08 17:26:03] <%TingleRotunda> @nexgencn The thing about CSP's monthly sub option was that you wouldn't lose access to CSP. You would just lose access to certain features following the 2.1 update, but all of the features up to 2.0 would still be accessible to you.

[2023-01-08 23:20:00] <%s1nnabun> Spanish has 5 vowel sounds, while Portuguese is leading with 9. The vowels with a nasal sound don't found in Spanish. Portuguese has much more complex phonology than Spanish with many extra sounds. And this is the one reason that Portuguese speakers have an easier time understanding spoken Spanish than vice versa.
