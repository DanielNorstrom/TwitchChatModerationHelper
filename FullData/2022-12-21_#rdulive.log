[2022-12-21 16:02:28] <%phrb27> kripp is so depressing to watch
[2022-12-21 16:02:28] <@^Streamlabs> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking. HmmmG

[2022-12-21 17:22:34] <refreshyourpage> It should summon 8 each. First kadgar increases each summon by summoning 2 additional. Then the second kad summons an additional. But you still get the initial summon

[2022-12-21 19:25:14] <ShiftyDrifter> Good afternoon @Rdulive. My name is Allen Turner, owner and CEO of Wrench (dot com). There was a mix up with our marketing department and we thought WE were sponsering you, not Wren. Soon in the mail you will receive a parcel of high quality wrenches from us at Wrench (dot com). Please feel free to keep them, as we hope to work with you in the future.

[2022-12-21 19:38:19] <%+izverceanu> the top 1% wealthiest individuals emit about 110 tons of carbon emissions per year, an extreme number dwarfed by the top .1% (467 tons) and the top .01% (2,530 tons). So all high-altitude flights aside, the wealthiest individuals still produce many times more carbon pollution in an average year than an individual in the bottom billion does in a lifetime.
