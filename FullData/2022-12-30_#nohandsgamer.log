[2022-12-30 00:06:07] <bLaZiNgShArK02> I saw meatman playing this deck, he wasn't particularly happy with the build, he was thinking about adding back the relic package
[2022-12-30 00:06:29] <hspgm> you lose one turn
[2022-12-30 00:06:48] <%vayazu2> renathal should be a permanent and separate game mode. so everyone can be happy
[2022-12-30 00:06:51] <%+Xeath5> i just saw you play a 1/1 minion on turn 6

[2022-12-30 00:08:48] <bLaZiNgShArK02> the deck definitely looked better in your hands, ig there can only be 1 true champion

[2022-12-30 00:09:13] <+helix_sky> this DH deck only 3 legendaries > better than that beast hunter with like 10 legendaries haha
[2022-12-30 00:09:19] <+danizcg> I just hit legend in classic with control Priest, pretty funny seriously
[2022-12-30 00:09:43] <ScarecrowCR> Ok grandma NoHands you need to get to bed before you start hallucinating about resource management and such
[2022-12-30 00:09:43] <McleodMenace> any reason you aren't running coordinated strike?
[2022-12-30 00:09:46] <%+Xeath5> i played like 30 games in classic with some random f2p cards
[2022-12-30 00:09:48] <+Dtkaze> Mountain bear is still ok
[2022-12-30 00:09:51] <Bilwitz> taunts are now only useful for having the other player activate your deathrattle

[2022-12-30 00:43:56] <SmokeBuddha> @Lvl_100_Magikarp i think it has more to do with their class identity. they are the tempo/burn class which is just always pretty good as long as its "balanced"

[2022-12-30 00:44:42] <modsarecringe_69> it spends mana too efficiently, it discovers outs too easily, it has too many options and ways to cheat mana

[2022-12-30 01:16:25] <ScarecrowCR> @Darwal you need a special macro that drags your mouse to the left exactl 3mm / second which starts to run  when the game is found
[2022-12-30 01:16:36] <Debatingplains3> I've been playing the Witcher 3. Some of the best side quests in gaming.
[2022-12-30 01:17:05] <%vayazu2> witcher 3 is still the best game i ever played. good recommend
[2022-12-30 01:17:14] <i_wraith_x> @debatingplains3 they almost all feel like main quests!

[2022-12-30 01:19:34] <i_wraith_x> Rogue sometimes getting those massive ghosts out early is a challenge to deal with, for sure.

[2022-12-30 02:18:14] <+lurasidone11> @NoHandsGamer They should nerf Jace to 9 mana. I think that would fix everything
[2022-12-30 02:18:18] <unknlai> actyallt the maximum is 50 csrd in deck

[2022-12-30 02:18:43] <%+slighthaze> There are two unused sides to the board... we get Two Heros and Decks each... Tag Team Match and the cards are all Wrestling related Kappa
[2022-12-30 02:18:45] <%+shanevapid> My prediction is they will nerf the shit out of dh and rogue again and frost dk and aggro mage will be the best decks - not necessarily slower

[2022-12-30 02:18:48] <BatrachosHS> attrition is the most fun deck type YEP

[2022-12-30 02:18:59] <!TheoHS_> would also be nice if decks couldnt fatigue on turn 7
[2022-12-30 02:19:01] <Bilwitz> I think renethal to 40 hp 45 cards would be interesting as an alternative, but I'm pretty sure requiring more cards for meta decks is problematic
[2022-12-30 02:19:10] <StanTehMan> we want 45 min control warrior mirrors >:(

[2022-12-30 02:23:22] <turn1concede> no kappa imo. exact lethal. beautiful.
[2022-12-30 02:23:23] <Anbuguy> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
[2022-12-30 02:23:24] <Giannhs1998> impossible, perhaps the meta is incomplete
[2022-12-30 02:23:30] <FatalVindicator> @nohandsgamer this meta is perfect for statistics tho. 100 games an hour means more data ;)

[2022-12-30 02:25:57] <patrikk808> not a cool idea, you just concede turn one with aggro or combo decks
[2022-12-30 02:26:00] <%snaktray> u just auto lose to the coin in control

[2022-12-30 02:32:19] <%+Xeath5> edwin to 2 and jace to 6 or riot
[2022-12-30 02:32:28] <mightyergoTV> their 8 drop is a really strong finisher, but the deck has no real plays leading up to that amd no real corpse synergies

[2022-12-30 02:33:09] <Anbuguy> that's why classic hearthstone back in 2013 was fun , the only mana cheating back then was millhouse and it was for your opponent KEKW
[2022-12-30 02:33:19] <lolblinny> crazy idea. you can ban a class from your ranked games kind of like in tourneys
[2022-12-30 02:33:24] <%+Xeath5> strimmer said pee elementals thihihi
[2022-12-30 02:33:25] <+aimlessgang> How about this ? At the start of game put a card into both of decks and transform both decks into sheeps when drawn
[2022-12-30 02:33:28] <astroworldhs> that 5 health is so big
[2022-12-30 02:33:30] <+aimlessgang> Best board meta
[2022-12-30 02:33:31] <%snaktray> i can't count how many games with 40 health and I win with less than 5 left
[2022-12-30 02:33:55] <Darwal> @Anbuguy and rogue, and druid, and warlock...mana cheating was going on, but it wasn't as extreme
[2022-12-30 02:34:01] <+Eudyptes151> you think 40 hp be baseline to help compensate for creep?
[2022-12-30 02:34:05] <5ftHax> not according to reddit they have all the solutions
[2022-12-30 02:34:12] <prabh23> Classic is so slow lmao, if your opponent has like a 3-4 on turn 3 you’re sweating

[2022-12-30 02:39:14] <%+GuildChatter> They literally designed for a spell-only DH.  It's an archetype they wanted.
[2022-12-30 02:39:20] <prabh23> It’ll be rush warriors time finally

[2022-12-30 02:39:35] <5ftHax> problem is then druid kinda beats everything
[2022-12-30 02:39:44] <5ftHax> bc they just kill you from 35
[2022-12-30 02:39:50] <ScarecrowCR> They will nerf the DH Quest to not reduce below 1.....calling it right here

[2022-12-30 02:42:58] <Darwal> some players like faster decks and others like slower decks. does it matter if they like something that you don't. i'm confused.
[2022-12-30 02:43:05] <+jabaturd> need 7 mana
[2022-12-30 02:43:21] <%+slighthaze> i liked naga priest :(

[2022-12-30 02:44:23] <curtarc> I mean, based on the nuking that CWarrior took when it was a high Tier 2 deck, I really don't expect any control decks to be that good anytime soon. Devs don't seem to enjoy that type of strategy
[2022-12-30 02:44:26] <arcawarchief> @NoHandsGamer where priest quest tho? <3

[2022-12-30 03:09:10] <%+irrationalwife> the bigger question is why are you playing minions
[2022-12-30 03:09:14] <FarseerMicro> because you don't use them till you need them.
[2022-12-30 03:09:31] <+piecell> Soulstealer? I think you mean souleater’s scythe
[2022-12-30 03:09:31] <Anbuguy> soulstealer is an 8 mana card , it's out of standard boundaries
[2022-12-30 03:09:38] <+reaperonetho> it's a bad thing because i'm playing rogue and they keep removing all my stealthed cards

[2022-12-30 03:24:30] <%+slighthaze> the moral of the story is don't mess with Greta Kappa
[2022-12-30 03:24:49] <%+RoboClam> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. We like having a variety of deck types but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not very fun or interactive.

[2022-12-30 03:25:05] <%ItsJustSnipe> is it ever worth playing kurtrus with this deck?
[2022-12-30 03:25:09] <%+Xeath5> @NoHandsGamer thanks for losing to warrior earlier now it gets another 12 cards nerfed for beating the best deck Kappa

[2022-12-30 03:26:22] <ioreign1> So we nerfed 14 warrior cards in horrendous ways
[2022-12-30 03:26:24] <%sirsquilliam_tentpoles> that sounds broken imo

[2022-12-30 03:26:31] <dendaihs> They will give captain rush instead of charge
[2022-12-30 03:26:33] <%vayazu2> i can see mine warlock get pre emptively nerfed with the others
[2022-12-30 03:26:35] <%rexmkh> we have also given some of warrior's armor gain to druid to make games shorter
[2022-12-30 03:26:36] <Bilwitz> Nellie's nerf is so weird. It should reduce the cost of pirates by 2-3 so that its viable but no smite
[2022-12-30 03:26:38] <+Dallaen> That's an actual possibility
[2022-12-30 03:26:38] <ScarecrowCR> just bring charge back to patches and do whatever
