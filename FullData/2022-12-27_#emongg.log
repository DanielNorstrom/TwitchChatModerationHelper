[2022-12-27 00:33:42] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-27 02:30:09] <@%^StreamElements> My favorite streamer is the Emongg guy. he is very powerfull. his special "road to masters" honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two face cams and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a joke.

[2022-12-27 05:51:00] <Grenadesniper> @emongg yallwork out at all? cause i take my deaths and multiply it by elims, and do that many pushups if i lose
[2022-12-27 05:51:03] <fatguy925> @Y09hurt Its because Korean casters are treating Esports as a sport, not a golf or chess match rooFeels
[2022-12-27 05:51:10] <%RhettOfBodom> achilios has slowed down cause he does so much valorant casting

[2022-12-27 16:27:23] <benisthebestdoggy> @zingore31223 She uses Fortify to negate the hook and can javelin/spin to make hog go out of hook range for their teammates
[2022-12-27 16:27:25] <+notorious_cid> @zingore31223 Her spear is basically a hard counter to his heal
[2022-12-27 16:27:26] <ChefPachimari> have we already done speculation on the rework?

[2022-12-27 16:33:21] <tonyhawk1026> it's not her damage, it's the same thing as pharah in the lower ranks, she's just harder to hit because she's slim and has fade. and the added bonus of it being impossible for her to miss.
[2022-12-27 16:33:23] <NikTheNarwhale> If moira dmg goes down I think her healing should go up tho

[2022-12-27 16:36:13] <DV4DISC0> Im not talking about the sleep dart or heal , like kiriko can counter ana’s whole kit, ana should be able to climb or go to high places
[2022-12-27 16:36:16] <grimmslight> if they popped ult after it could be considered as an assist since it boosts their ult cooldown
[2022-12-27 16:36:22] <+notorious_cid> Ram feels like how he was intended to play on release
[2022-12-27 16:36:27] <%greg0409> and I imagine the issue with sojourn is she still oneshots with a damage boost?

[2022-12-27 17:08:16] <%satanten> I miss the 2cp maps because they were pretty xD
[2022-12-27 17:08:17] <%$LeWitcher> Didnt think of it ever sense and happy about it
[2022-12-27 17:08:17] <BrevityL> 2CP > Push
[2022-12-27 17:08:19] <%Vagnoosvensnerg> @janonymous You can see how it goes when it's in arcade from time to time
[2022-12-27 17:08:20] <+ArsenixShirogon> I don't necessarily miss them either but also Push OMEGALUL
[2022-12-27 17:08:23] <%Nennai> NODDERS

[2022-12-27 17:08:29] <SkellOrigins> Just bring back Lunar Base Kappa
[2022-12-27 17:08:29] <%+haylee_xx> i like push much better than 2cp

[2022-12-27 17:08:31] <%N30NxL1T3x> good ol anubis
[2022-12-27 17:08:31] <%brokensand10> push is terrible as well tho
[2022-12-27 17:08:33] <%missdebbie3> :D :D
[2022-12-27 17:08:33] <%$janonymous> @Vagnoosvensnerg that's with open q rules though right
[2022-12-27 17:08:33] <%nao_ir> yep
[2022-12-27 17:08:33] <biak911> hahahaha
[2022-12-27 17:08:34] <+notorious_cid> Push is better than 2cp, though not by much
[2022-12-27 17:08:35] <+portogeezer> Paris, lunar, volskya all awful

[2022-12-27 17:08:36] <%Demoleetion> pretty much, yeah
[2022-12-27 17:08:38] <%frostkingcc> so truth
[2022-12-27 17:08:38] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> pretty accurate

[2022-12-27 17:08:43] <+TimboDrisco> @emongg would it be easier to push 2cp chokes now with tank changes?
[2022-12-27 17:08:45] <+D_Pacman> if the maps were made better would you be more open to the format
[2022-12-27 17:08:46] <KaiWonder> yeah but there was some good ones like Anubis
[2022-12-27 17:08:46] <%Nennai> I hate paris attack
[2022-12-27 17:08:46] <OllieCalico> I miss paris
[2022-12-27 17:08:46] <%+sierramarlee> TRUE KEKW
[2022-12-27 17:08:47] <+Volderok> Thats not a 2cp problem thats a map design problem. Open more areas to enter
[2022-12-27 17:08:47] <itssid_> that seems like a map issue not 2cp issue monkaHmm
[2022-12-27 17:08:50] <svartaloka> 2 cp will be not really good when there is rammatra ulti haunting
[2022-12-27 17:08:54] <$trebber> @Emongg any guess when the PvE game will come out?
[2022-12-27 17:08:54] <biak911> they can turn 2cp to hybrid
[2022-12-27 17:08:56] <LizOpTwitch> I kinda like push tbh. Walking half of the game because a Sojourn kills me every dang time
[2022-12-27 17:08:57] <%+jsapphire6> 2cp get worse with double sheild
[2022-12-27 17:08:57] <%+Damnitbinks> Minus HLC all the 2cp maps that are no longer in rotation had great looking maps. I feel bad for the designers who have their work vaulted.
[2022-12-27 17:08:57] <polseman83> 2 point Hanamura you can flank
[2022-12-27 17:09:00] <biak911> sigma map!

[2022-12-27 17:09:00] <%Vagnoosvensnerg> @janonymous I'm not too sure about that one, I don't think it is, but I could be wrong
[2022-12-27 17:09:02] <tntnew> i want those maps back
[2022-12-27 17:09:04] <jaawesome635> emongC_TK
[2022-12-27 17:09:04] <sanfloo_> 2CP????
[2022-12-27 17:09:07] <%+haylee_xx> i loved the maps not the game modes
[2022-12-27 17:09:12] <%Nennai> @Volderok NODDERS the problem is that it's much more glaring on 2cp
[2022-12-27 17:09:15] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> @hezzz24 YEAH MAN, THAT'S COOL
[2022-12-27 17:09:17] <narmiee> i hope they turn the 2cp maps into death match maps
[2022-12-27 17:09:19] <zekr000> What’s PvE
[2022-12-27 17:09:19] <%$wasabiroot> don't forget the defense broken spawn advantage on 2nd pt

[2022-12-27 17:09:30] <Czarkastik> is that a fulgore skin?
[2022-12-27 17:09:31] <%satanten> Maybe they could rework the 2cp maps to make them into 1 control map?
[2022-12-27 17:09:32] <biak911> circuit royale is a Sigma and Moira map!
[2022-12-27 17:09:40] <%Nennai> @wasabiroot that's still a thing on push tho

[2022-12-27 17:14:03] <+ArsenixShirogon> @masakiss_eucalyptus they are 2 different extremes of the same poor map design. 2cp is all chokes and push is nearly all flanks. When my friends and I quickplay on push and someone calls a flank the response is always "every angle is a flank"

[2022-12-27 18:16:01] <+cjthedjdolphin> Hog died. Self heal cooldown needs to be reduced and they need to increase the damage reduction and the amount it heals

[2022-12-27 22:04:32] <SkidMcmarxx> I'm a really good Overwatch player but the enemy Sojourn is just better. I hit all my heals, perfectly manage my abilities, and my ults are immaculate. If I had any interest in it, I could have gone pro. But I gotta tip my hat to the enemy Sojourn as she shifts up and 1-taps me across the map. "That was a nice shot" I say, as I walk back from spawn.

While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch.
