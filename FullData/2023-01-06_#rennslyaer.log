[2023-01-06 09:43:49] <@%$DuckyKatsumi> Well, at out breaks.  You can use picnic tables to reset the outbreak. So what you do is save before start, turn off auto save. Then you carefully kill 60 outbreak Pokémon.. being careful to not clear the outbreak. And after that you keep using the picnic table to reset the outbreak. Having the outbreak + the murdered Pokémon ups the  chance of a shiny appearing by a lot and even more so with a shiny charm.  @fayahl

[2023-01-06 11:50:42] <%+tomkibblez> Apparently Tinketon's shoot them out of the air, using their hammer like a golf club to smack things at them to knock them out of the sky
[2023-01-06 11:50:42] <@%+carthage67> Your first trip through here is so annoying. The paradox pokemon hardly spawn, there's random pointless dialog that is *not* voice acted and therefore fucking awful, and you can't do shit while it's going
[2023-01-06 11:50:46] <!%$PaperxRose> it be to cringe

[2023-01-06 11:53:46] <@%+carthage67> cheer100 Most of the pokemon you haven't seen will spawn later, or after you finish the story and come back a second time. Also, there's a cave here that is the perfect spot to shiny hunt normal type pokemon, but you can't get to it without your legendary transportation

[2023-01-06 12:21:36] <Hoodie__Raccoon> @Prince_Berzerk My headcannon is that centuries of humanity exposed to the unusual and awesome powers of Pokémon causes humans to slightly "evolve" the same way as the pocket monsters.

[2023-01-06 13:23:49] <Hoodie__Raccoon> I like the idea of Pokémon having vocal songs in the games. It's something I could support. In fact, hiring a popular singer is not a BAD idea on PAPER

[2023-01-06 13:25:20] <%+tomkibblez> So even though it turned out Sada was just an AI, there's a theory that the AI itself was being controlled by an unknown legendary Pokemon that has the ability to grant wishes/bring thoughts in to reality. Because Sada wanted to study the past so much, it granted her wish. And created paradox mons to match her theories of what prehistoric Pokemon were like.

[2023-01-06 13:33:57] <%+tomkibblez> Violet is arguably the more fucked up version. All of the Pokemon there have been digitized to strengthen them against some unknown threat. Whereas Sada just wants to look into to the past and see prehistoric versions of what she already knows.

[2023-01-06 13:45:40] <%$r0adspikes> So do the gym leaders just have low lvl pokemon on backup or do they have to catch a new one every so often cause of how much ass it beats?
[2023-01-06 13:45:45] <%GermxWarfare> Can’t believe dunsparce finally got an evolution and it’s that
[2023-01-06 13:45:56] <%$r0adspikes> And these are the actual main Pokemon of the guy
[2023-01-06 13:46:07] <$Tonnesofnoob> Totally didn't open stream on my phone so I could see Larry again
[2023-01-06 13:46:15] <%m_seagulI> hi ren im back
[2023-01-06 13:46:19] <%$r0adspikes> Cause within a year of constant battle a pokemon could easily hit lvl 100 technically

[2023-01-06 13:47:24] <%$r0adspikes> So they just have weak ass pokemon on standby
[2023-01-06 13:47:36] <%$r0adspikes> that's wild
[2023-01-06 13:47:52] <!%+BastenCathulhu> lol
[2023-01-06 13:48:03] <%$r0adspikes> So do they just kill the others once they get to a certain lvl
[2023-01-06 13:48:04] <%GermxWarfare> I mean I think everyone that plays Pokémon just has that one box full of low level pokemon
[2023-01-06 13:48:04] <!%+BastenCathulhu> Game glitched.
[2023-01-06 13:48:04] <dustywolfie28> Mine did the same glitch merthe4Emwheeze
[2023-01-06 13:48:15] <%animefannatsu> Because tinkaton don’t give a fuck
[2023-01-06 13:48:24] <%badumtish> Tooo strong she accidently burried herself
[2023-01-06 13:48:25] <%Sir_Flippington_The_3rd> If she wants to be in the floor she can be Kappa
[2023-01-06 13:48:32] <!%+BastenCathulhu> Tinkaton is heavy, Tinkaton broke the floor.
