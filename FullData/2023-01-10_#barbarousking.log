[2023-01-10 01:15:01] <%+play_with_matches> botw early game rules but it never really peaks

[2023-01-10 01:15:07] <%+DunlapJones> just thought overall there wasn't enough main story

[2023-01-10 01:15:18] <%HoodyXP> I didnt like the weapons breaking and lack of dungeons
[2023-01-10 01:15:20] <TheNocturus> so is this just Doom with aiming up? xd
[2023-01-10 01:15:27] <Mizeostrander> Botw is a great game, but an ok zelda game
[2023-01-10 01:15:30] <%+khilendel> I have one common criticism - not enough main dungeons - otherwise its a masterpiece.
[2023-01-10 01:15:30] <+chazzmcbad> @BarbarousKing the worst thing about BoTW is they tried to sell it twice
[2023-01-10 01:15:31] <%Lance_J> I like replaying Zelda games and BotW has low replay value, so I dont enjoy it as much
[2023-01-10 01:15:33] <%+occulus1975> the world felt very empty

[2023-01-10 01:15:45] <%$ornamentalpotat0> also the remix of the Zelda theme in the castle is incredible

[2023-01-10 01:16:44] <%+agchee> Like with most games, if you can enjoy it for what it is & not what it isn't, you'll have a good time. Lots of people wanted BotW to be different & hated it.
[2023-01-10 01:16:45] <%higHChloride> @Fail_Snail but because those interactions lacked any meaningful gameplay value, the game ended up w/ the reputation of "tech demo"

[2023-01-10 01:16:56] <%+humbleoctopus> the worst aspect of BOTW is the constant breaking of weapons. good concept but gets annoying

[2023-01-10 01:37:35] <$flemd0g> Barb I'm glad to see you enjoying quake. I loved playing this game when I was a kid.
[2023-01-10 01:37:36] <%$bossessob> Kids are developing brain matter at a higher rate, which requires glucose
[2023-01-10 01:37:38] <%ArtificialNebulae> Speaking of spicy, I made some spicy habanero apple jelly yesterday. So good!
[2023-01-10 01:37:42] <FolgersInn> Do you eat Cheetos Flaming Hots?
[2023-01-10 01:37:42] <%+khilendel> People like spicy food when they get old BECAUSE their taste buds are destroyed and spice is one of the easiest to taste.
[2023-01-10 01:37:42] <%+mykeljmoney> Cigarette smoking is probably the worst thing for damaging taste
[2023-01-10 01:37:44] <%$crizotibin> what is paky or that what you said barb?

[2023-01-10 01:38:34] <%CarbonAxiom> @angry_smurf33 This is where I stand. The weirdest thing with most people's tastes is that they heavily prefer either savory or sweet stuff, when for me it's always "I like both a lot. Just depends on the time and place"
[2023-01-10 01:38:37] <Mr_Panda> i'd like some doom music played over this

[2023-01-10 01:39:33] <%novashiles> The Ring of Shadows is a Powerup in Quake that makes the player invisible except for his eyes, lasts for 30 seconds

[2023-01-10 02:26:23] <%Crizzle777> I think it's taxed like a bonus so about 30%
[2023-01-10 02:26:23] <%valse_01> you'll get around 450million (ish) if you took the lump sump

An accountant friend I have said every year of that money is subject to changes in tax code so you could potentially be fucked in the long term. You also might die before you collect but I‚Äôm not sure on the legality of making it an inheritance or some shit

[2023-01-10 03:09:38] <%blueskytreb82> I like Fellowship because the story is more narrow than the other two

[2023-01-10 03:09:39] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Fellowship pacing is the best
[2023-01-10 03:09:41] <%$tators200> I went to a midnight showing of return of the kings. Had to piss so bad at the end
[2023-01-10 03:09:41] <%$namelessthree> The only thing that came close to fellowship is rings of power
[2023-01-10 03:09:41] <%ShowtimeTylers> for me its Two Towers, Fellowship, then Return of the King
[2023-01-10 03:09:44] <%$outlawcountrywaylon> I was blown away after seeing fellowship as a kid

[2023-01-10 03:10:12] <%+hanhuc> fellowship is written most like a movie
[2023-01-10 03:10:14] <ChildGranny> there is no movie to rule them all

[2023-01-10 03:10:16] <+thanatosia> Fellowship is the only one where I have zero issues with Peter Jacksons Changes.   I love all 3 movies, but 2 towers and RotK have things changed I hate at times  (Faramir!)
[2023-01-10 03:10:19] <%$namelessthree> I feel like rings of power came pretty close to fellowship

[2023-01-10 03:10:24] <%ShowtimeTylers> ya true Fellowship was good enough to where it could be a micro story and feel complete
[2023-01-10 03:10:25] <aern0r> The eerie atmosphere of entering Moria the first time seeing that movie was so great
[2023-01-10 03:10:26] <%$PeepTheHorror> i'm very glad i was at the lotr watch party when you did that, still one of my top series now
[2023-01-10 03:10:26] <%+evilbsavage> I always thought the 2 towers was the best.  Helms deep
[2023-01-10 03:10:28] <%mortalwombat924> I kinda wish they left in legolas just murdering a nazgul from the boat in fellowship.

[2023-01-10 03:11:18] <%ecstaticbroccoli> Fellowship was also so good because it was all new. And the casting, music, art design all hit so perfectly
[2023-01-10 03:11:19] <restraintd> multiplayer is where quake really shined
[2023-01-10 03:11:19] <KossPortaPros> has Barb played either of the System Shocks?
[2023-01-10 03:11:20] <paradox28491> didnt they just make a lotr tv show?
[2023-01-10 03:11:25] <%+Drewge> I dont understand why they cut the Fellowship extended. We lost so many good scenes

[2023-01-10 04:29:29] <+chogram> Half-Life has some puzzley stuff, so it was probably that.
[2023-01-10 04:29:32] <1metalnation> and HL2 is one of, if not the best story FPS game evermade
[2023-01-10 04:29:32] <+we_are_turok> Thats why duke nukem 64 will always ge superior... the 3d effect is TRASH

[2023-01-10 04:51:28] <@%$deejay4am> @deejay4am git's not great for binary files but it is possible to do. the ASM files are text files though, so some of it could benefit? probably more trouble than it's worth for a project like this.

[2023-01-10 04:52:47] <%AerithosTheUseless> @deejay4am It'd still be beneficial since you can have easy snapshots of the rom file, and all change history to ASM is preserved so you can see what you changed or broke.

[2023-01-10 04:52:57] <%+floppie7th> @deejay4am You lose the diff benefits but it works fine for small binaries - I use git for ECU tunes on my car and they're serialized to god knows what binary format.  I wouldn't go using it to version control large binary files, though
[2023-01-10 04:53:02] <%NotMacNamera> @deejay4am makes sense.  I started using git but seem to agree after a couple days.

[2023-01-10 05:09:20] <%Tim_fishh> the best part of fromsoft games are bosses IMO and elden ring lacks a bit here and three

[2023-01-10 05:10:22] <%ghidorahsfury> @Tim_fishh it's weird. But my favorite part of Fromsoft if exploration. Finding bosses, weird stuff in the world, I love that shit. The combat is a bonus
[2023-01-10 05:10:24] <%Zeik188> @ThudnerHwak I've considered it. Haven't actually done so yet. People ALWAYS talk about how good Sekiro is so I might try it next

[2023-01-10 05:10:57] <%$PolleyGuitar> If Elden Ring is someones entry point to From Soft Games, where would you recommend they go next within the SoulsBorne family of games?
[2023-01-10 05:11:03] <%ThudnerHwak> DS1 and BB are my faves. But if you want even more precise and demanding combat, Seki would be the way to go
[2023-01-10 05:11:06] <%NotMacNamera> @ThudnerHwak I'll give a counter opinion.  I didn't like it :)  It's a good game though.

[2023-01-10 05:14:04] <%ThudnerHwak> @NotMacNamera there were parts of Seki that I absolutely loved but also some that I didn't like at all. way more polarizing for me than other Souls games

[2023-01-10 05:16:02] <%+Mase_Face_> I think Elden Ring was a great entry point to souls games. Mimic Tear, the ability to go anywhere, leave bosses and come back, etc.That being said... Love Sekiro haha

[2023-01-10 05:31:39] <+Home_Inspector> @barbarousking what‚Äôs the name of that movie you talk about that you saw as a kid that was really fucked up?
[2023-01-10 05:31:40] <%+platinasz> Have you watched Elite Squad or God's City?
[2023-01-10 05:31:40] <%BelAirJeff> This soundtrack goes so hard

[2023-01-10 05:31:50] <%bingo2thebongo> Alice in borderland was good too
[2023-01-10 05:31:52] <salemthecat_> I used to be ok with squidgame until people started usin git as an excuse to be racist

[2023-01-10 06:07:59] <%ShowtimeTylers> better to under-indicate then over
[2023-01-10 06:08:03] <%DonkeyMintInc> No, it's a puzzleformer, don't indicate it.  The player should figure it out

[2023-01-10 15:12:26] <+kmacdone> i love the play style of grounded. definitely seems like it was intended more for group play though
[2023-01-10 15:12:27] <%$Bloody_Raw> i dont think they designed the difficulty around solo play

[2023-01-10 15:13:31] <%$trenchiest> For grounded I feel that the difficulty is too realistic for what it is.
[2023-01-10 15:13:36] <%cornsbakedgoods> grounded seems built for 4players on hard
[2023-01-10 15:13:36] <%alucard835> they didn't have any ideas so they just copy pasted everything
[2023-01-10 15:13:36] <%pnaha> my bread!
[2023-01-10 15:13:49] <%manfred_bratwurst> I suppose the add spam makes sense considering the fact that it got to account for 4 possible players but it's a weird scaling
[2023-01-10 15:14:01] <%+MegaSquishee> Grounded... bad? modCheck
[2023-01-10 15:14:01] <%+UraniumQ33> well that ties back into the old argument people have about difficulty.
[2023-01-10 15:14:06] <%LemonStir> And then it gets harder when you make a zip line that's perfectly level with the other side
[2023-01-10 15:14:06] <@%$deejay4am> "here's more dudes" isn't usually the best strat for increasing difficulty
[2023-01-10 15:14:06] <%$trenchiest> Ah, about the boss fight, yeah, they could have made the boss "futuristic" but not annoying
[2023-01-10 15:14:20] <%+CJRyzer> is that a symptom of devs expecting everyone to play with a group? I feel like that'd be kinda easy to adjust for
[2023-01-10 15:14:27] <%archang3l_media> these enemies are so stupid, they just forget to die

[2023-01-10 15:14:36] <%+CJRyzer> from the devs side
[2023-01-10 15:14:36] <%corignis> @LemonStir does creating a zipline cause more or harder enemies to spawn?
[2023-01-10 15:14:36] <%$FengWeiWay> @deejay4am unless i'ts doom LUL
[2023-01-10 15:14:36] <%$trenchiest> The ads aren't even part of the difficulty LUL
[2023-01-10 15:14:36] <%alucard835> @CJRyzer probably. makes me think of Diablo II when multiple players would join the enemies would scale up
[2023-01-10 15:14:56] <%Beeteebee> Not counting whoa mode with this statement, but Assistant Manager wasn't that hard for me once I knew the fight
[2023-01-10 15:14:59] <%+Pressors> Your damage seems pretty good

[2023-01-10 15:15:16] <%+MiloticMaster2> @CJRyzer its not that easy to adjust for, crowd control & aggro is not linear
[2023-01-10 15:15:16] <%+CJRyzer> @alucard835 in this case solo play should maybe scale down a tad?
[2023-01-10 15:15:18] <%$mDoys> Does Doom overwrite itself if you have it on attack and special, like Hangover does?
[2023-01-10 15:15:18] <%Miets> There are also mario maker levels that have 1 trick that is a VERY stupid tech that has like 5 frame perfect inputs.
[2023-01-10 15:15:36] <%LemonStir> @corignis Oh I'm totally making fun of Barb when he made that zipline that went like half a dick per hour
[2023-01-10 15:15:44] <%+MegaSquishee> So Grounded is bad is what you're saying.
[2023-01-10 15:15:48] <%$Marcupp> MadgeLate
[2023-01-10 15:15:48] <%alucard835> @CJRyzer yeah I think the issue was they expect you to play in groups and that's baseline for single player play but not tuned for higher difficulty
[2023-01-10 15:15:51] <%neverhadfun1> Sucks because at times difficulty I feel is slapped on at the end, not designed throughout.
[2023-01-10 15:15:56] <%imisgrunbula> now we need a fountain asap
[2023-01-10 15:16:04] <%+CJRyzer> @miloticmaster2 that's possibly fair
[2023-01-10 15:16:06] <HaggisBodine> got to be impending doom
[2023-01-10 15:16:08] <%FrsMns> Think the impending
[2023-01-10 15:16:12] <%+MegaSquishee> Barb would you play Grounded again?

[2023-01-10 15:16:19] <%Miets> It is pretty surprising though how much content some creators can farm out of MM2 still.
[2023-01-10 15:16:19] <%+penguinfarm> umm yeah I legit pull out a calculator for impending vs the doom itself

[2023-01-10 15:16:37] <%+UraniumQ33> I like when difficulty makes you rethink how to approach an enemy. Not just make it a "bullet" sponge or higher dmg output they do.
[2023-01-10 15:16:43] <%imisgrunbula> PeepoJuice
[2023-01-10 15:16:45] <%LemonStir> Mathematically impending doom was the right choice, although it will only be 2 extra damage
[2023-01-10 15:16:46] <%+SkoSoSy> Just ran into a room of about 15 armored boneheads that constantly regenerated each other‚Äôs hearts. I literally couldn‚Äôt kill them

[2023-01-10 17:50:12] <%+PoisonPowder> according to 10 seconds of googling, gumbo is stew served with rice, and jambalaya is cooked with rice
[2023-01-10 17:50:12] <%joshuahatcher> difference between jambalaya and gumbo: gumbo is a stew with rice served separately. jambalaya is a stew that is cooked WITH rice.

[2023-01-10 18:49:09] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> he just kept talking and talking in one long, incredibly unbroken sentence, moving from topic to topic so that no one had the chance to interrupt him. It was really quite hypnotic

[2023-01-10 18:50:32] <%+Kasumiblue> Shatner got to go into space not too long ago and he had a REALLY interesting take on seeing the Earth from that perspective
[2023-01-10 18:50:32] <+JeanVaIjean24601> everytime someone says they like TOS I imagine they just remember the movies fondly and never actually watched the series

[2023-01-10 18:50:49] <Arrowheadberto> my favorite star trek was the phantom of the menace

[2023-01-10 20:02:35] <%higHChloride> "3d bullet hell" was not something I thought was in returnal
[2023-01-10 20:02:35] <%grimmskin_77> I can comprehend Returnal better than Hades, Hades looks hype but I can't track the fella. The astronaut is front and center. I like that. Give em hell Barb barbLETSGO

[2023-01-10 21:05:31] <%darkaath14> ds2 is the perfect game
[2023-01-10 21:05:32] <%$JoeyGripps> Elden Ring had issues, but it was still GOTY over the other games
[2023-01-10 21:05:32] <%johnthegg> i played through botw and enjoyed it but it's also a game where i don't understand the hyperbole around it
[2023-01-10 21:05:33] <%$cherryghost41> I do not think it is the greatest thing of all time, but I thought it was a good game and a great continuation of the story

[2023-01-10 21:05:37] <Mr_Panda> i had more fun with elden ring than anything in the last 6-7 years, man it was a blast played blind
[2023-01-10 21:05:37] <%alucard835> Elden Ring towards the end got so exhausting with all the massive slam attacks and AOEs
[2023-01-10 21:05:38] <%beanboymatt> I feel like Elden Ring's issues are mainly nit-picky, "this could've been better if X happened" scenarios
[2023-01-10 21:05:38] <%ShowtimeTylers> I liked LOU2 but I certainly can understand why the majority of the public did not
[2023-01-10 21:05:42] <%TheOrganTrail> TLOU2 just wouldn‚Äôt end
[2023-01-10 21:05:46] <%johnthegg> @JOHUshy people make fun of horizon on twitch all the time tho
[2023-01-10 21:05:47] <%+2chickenbakes> This game really embraces the Gears of War color palette

[2023-01-10 21:06:00] <%+true_tiron321> I had the most fun of Eldenring compared to all their games but I also love open world so bias is there
[2023-01-10 21:06:01] <%+DunlapJones> I backed off until I had finished the game so I missed it, what were your issues with ragnarok?

[2023-01-10 21:09:12] <vstpnv> sony needs some old franchise revive or a new IP
[2023-01-10 21:11:30] <%schmattywinkle> Jlaw is Stefne Speedburgs best work imo

[2023-01-10 21:12:03] <%johnthegg> people probably had lower expectations for horizon even if i liked the franchise more than GoW
[2023-01-10 21:12:04] <%bizangles> Poo put his "Mind Goblin" in his best-of 2022 video

[2023-01-10 21:12:06] <+Ncorbino> If they could just improve their awful combat it would be way better
[2023-01-10 21:12:06] <%+UraniumQ33> Sometimes I think how different and more confusing would Kingdom Hearts be if Hideo Kojima did it instead.
[2023-01-10 21:12:07] <%RustiVirus> and I'm freeeeeeeee
[2023-01-10 21:12:07] <%Diegazbro> @Diegazbro yeah man, literally what i though, didn't know they killed real people, hope those actors families got a good payment for that.
[2023-01-10 21:12:08] <MatraTheEternal> That's a statement for life.
[2023-01-10 21:12:08] <%fight_this> a money shot?

[2023-01-10 21:12:10] <%CapnRookin> looking at the trailer for jedi survivor I really hope they won't jump on the backseating companion bandwagon like HFW and GOW:R
[2023-01-10 21:12:10] <%schmattywinkle> streaming must be stressful for you
[2023-01-10 21:12:12] <%$RorschachCCCLX> most people love the money shot
[2023-01-10 21:12:12] <MatraTheEternal> "I see money coming at me, I think it's a gunshot"
