[2023-01-10 06:17:46] <%BravoBigBirdZ> LOL
[2023-01-10 06:17:48] <%BravoBigBirdZ> LUL
[2023-01-10 06:17:50] <%zoime14> @dman59847 it’s a possibility
[2023-01-10 06:17:58] <%flatballer> i mean it's gonna certainly slow down since yesterday was the first day
[2023-01-10 06:18:05] <%zoime14> I mean, just gotta wait and see
[2023-01-10 06:18:18] <%flatballer> but i think it's possible to get to that place
[2023-01-10 06:18:18] <%BravoBigBirdZ> True actually but I still think alot of time
[2023-01-10 06:18:36] <%+jjmoxk> last night the timer was at 65 . ten dono an hour to keep in going seems very doable
[2023-01-10 06:18:56] <%Kurorei53> does anyone know what is her companion's name that she is holding
[2023-01-10 06:18:56] <%+jjmoxk> it
[2023-01-10 06:19:04] <%dman59847> with the wheel adding so much time this stream won't ever end
[2023-01-10 06:19:07] <%flatballer> i mean especially if the wheel keeps giving her add 5 hours lol
