[2022-12-23 17:19:33] <+Gateron> So did they actually develop this game further in the year it has been released?
[2022-12-23 17:19:34] <ApplePieAlive> Shit internet is overkill
[2022-12-23 17:19:37] <%+p2htn> german internet with a trash pc was a nightmare xD
[2022-12-23 17:19:41] <%g_naq> yep, until they get a job
[2022-12-23 17:19:41] <%Miigula> true the struggle of playing in 15fps forms character
[2022-12-23 17:19:41] <%capitano49> Shit pc was not fun LUL
[2022-12-23 17:19:47] <!%$vacerss> the time when you actually checked if you can run a game
[2022-12-23 17:19:47] <%$Kubbaa> @TommyKayLIVE i've had a gtx 960 for 7 years now.
[2022-12-23 17:19:51] <%kenzo1809> I got my first real job this year and finally bought my first PC, I value this shit so much
[2022-12-23 17:19:54] <classicLYQ> it's always good to start from the bottom and experience the entire range of things
[2022-12-23 17:20:02] <%Sweetmuff1ns> @Gateron yes took them like a full year but they released mistlands update with the new biome
[2022-12-23 17:20:02] <%frankiarrow> learning to use money is realy hard when you have enough
[2022-12-23 17:20:02] <%true_TESTUDO> Sometimes I felt like no PC was better than a shit PC LUL
[2022-12-23 17:20:04] <spaniard31> bad PC isnt the standard anymore
[2022-12-23 17:20:04] <%capitano49> I had shit pc and shit internet and shit Brian
[2022-12-23 17:20:06] <%capitano49> Brainw
[2022-12-23 17:20:10] <%Sweetmuff1ns> they have two more biomes in the roadmap for updates
[2022-12-23 17:20:10] <allyofjustice> back then it was unheard of owning games you had never played too. I almost finished every game I had as a kid
[2022-12-23 17:20:10] <%Leoncino93> @TommyKayLIVE just like the first times with Windows 98 tommykDARK
[2022-12-23 17:20:11] <ApplePieAlive> i think the optimal time to have a shitty pc is for 2 years

[2022-12-23 17:20:25] <%+sirisaac42> And the experience of buying a new game only to find out that your pc is shit.
[2022-12-23 17:20:37] <%+Marian_Bros> now people complains about 60 fps i used to play with 20 and on lowest settings and still had fun
[2022-12-23 17:20:41] <%frankiarrow> all my friends where poor, for some reason i cant lvl with people that always had everything
[2022-12-23 17:20:42] <!%$vacerss> you should earn that pc, but not for free
[2022-12-23 17:20:42] <Roelath> Just make signs at your base and write where the items go
[2022-12-23 17:20:44] <%Malsu65> nice shirt Tomy

[2022-12-23 17:27:50] <anidiot665> tommy this may be a bit hypcritical as a non-sub, but do you consider expanding the options to spend channel points?
[2022-12-23 17:27:55] <%true_TESTUDO> Is that a bow in your pants or are you happy to see me?

[2022-12-23 17:30:47] <%soyuzmultifilm> I love this game, especially the building
[2022-12-23 17:30:54] <dipsisbtw> it's much funnier when you play it with friends doe
[2022-12-23 17:31:11] <!%$vacerss> the progression is very good

[2022-12-23 17:31:20] <+ldreamptl> This game is so under rated tbh. This game mooded it so gratifying
[2022-12-23 17:31:21] <toboss07> the games graphics looks older than your old ass
[2022-12-23 17:31:41] <monkzelron> tommy if you ever want to check out a more money management strategy game. Evil bank manager.
[2022-12-23 17:31:47] <!%$vacerss> potions are really good here
[2022-12-23 17:31:51] <%dave_grb> yeah you only needed Options in hard diff
[2022-12-23 17:31:51] <ApplePieAlive> the only thing i used them for is exploiting the enchanting and potion making system
[2022-12-23 17:31:54] <%+finis__belli> skyrim has survival mode now, so you need food
[2022-12-23 17:31:56] <jimmychad> bro just asking and just joined the stream PogO
[2022-12-23 17:31:56] <%viktor_mehl> tommy your child will graduate university before TES6 comes out

[2022-12-23 17:32:06] <%true_TESTUDO> Have you played Survival Mode in Skyrim @TommyKayLIVE  ?
[2022-12-23 17:32:08] <ApplePieAlive> Terraria does that too
[2022-12-23 17:32:08] <%josh0093> poisons were good for the sneak/bow build
[2022-12-23 17:32:11] <leireeell> I love the food system
[2022-12-23 17:32:22] <bullitbreed> witcher does it really well
[2022-12-23 17:32:23] <anidiot665> The Biggest betrayel in gaming history was fallout 76, after skyrim, elder scrolls, and new vegas
[2022-12-23 17:32:24] <%dave_grb> witcher 3 did that really good with potions
[2022-12-23 17:32:26] <+ldreamptl> @toboss07 That's the thing. The creaters didnt want to make a game with 4k grapfs. Like Conan etc... They ended up making a game that is in the top 10 games in steam
[2022-12-23 17:32:33] <!%SYNTH_VIKING> Any idea what armour build you will go for? Like heavy but slow or light and mobile?
[2022-12-23 17:32:33] <%FoxSierra52> except for that one boss where you eat 80 cheese wheels mid fight
[2022-12-23 17:32:34] <!%$vacerss> you got 2 hides
[2022-12-23 17:32:35] <%true_TESTUDO> I can't play Skyrim without Survival Mode anymore. I love it so much.
[2022-12-23 17:32:36] <Vurburne> Harder to kill, more loot if killed
[2022-12-23 17:32:36] <%viktor_mehl> thats why kingdom come deliverence is so great, sad you quit in the tutorial which doesnt represent the game at all
[2022-12-23 17:32:52] <+ldreamptl> The stars are the "lvls" the higher the lvl. The more hp, dmg and drops they give
[2022-12-23 17:32:57] <%true_TESTUDO> Survival Mode makes cooking essential
[2022-12-23 17:32:58] <%freshprince0161> Elden Ring's crafting was completely pointless I feel
[2022-12-23 17:33:06] <!%$vacerss> you got 2 hides
[2022-12-23 17:33:08] <bahamut___3> same shit with fallout 4
[2022-12-23 17:33:08] <@%+wolfpoops> he gave you 2
[2022-12-23 17:33:09] <leireeell> he gave u 2
[2022-12-23 17:33:11] <Lolkovec11> @tommykaylive What?! You need every potion you can get to survive. Butyes, cooking is useless
[2022-12-23 17:33:12] <%freshprince0161> And it's really in depth so it's a bit disappointing

[2022-12-23 17:47:52] <%Redsmile1> that has more to do with how their parents brought them up

[2022-12-23 17:49:05] <+ldreamptl> @TommyKayLIVE you can create waypoints in the mini map, by pressing M and double clicking. It can help when you find things like Berries, Mushrooms and stuff like that you goingto need later
