Also, who knows what the contract he signed says. Maybe he's forced not to shove any card by contract. Maybe he get's the bounties for himself. Who knows...

[2022-12-10 01:32:01] <trckdck> @JermthewormPoker Amphetamines are detrimental to performance unless you have ADHD. But they make non-ADHD people FEEL that they perform better. And coffee only helps when adenosine starts binding to receptors in your brain (late afternoon / in the evening)

[2022-12-10 01:34:31] <trckdck> @JermthewormPoker That's true, but drinking coffee before e.g. 14-16 if you wake up at 6-8, is not waking you up anyways. Adenosine starts binding to the adenosine receptors many, many hours after being awake.

[2022-12-10 01:40:05] <trckdck> @suzanne_illy Yeah, I'm reading abt it now, and I see that it CAN cause loss in impulse control (like compulsive gambling), but he brought it up as a response to something I said about amphetamines and caffeine, so idk what his point was tbh

[2022-12-10 01:45:56] <%+dukeof007> Chat is Hikaru’s significant other…
[2022-12-10 01:45:58] <trckdck> @highrockz The minimum "fee" to play a pot in that hand/round. And one player are forced to put out this "money" (a big blind) regardless if he want's to play or not, and another is forced to put out half a big blind (a small blind). They all take turns on being the "big blind" and "small blind".

[2022-12-10 01:46:52] <CCozbe> @trckdck yes maybe because of that fact i should have played my JJ diff but the blinds go up so fast you hav eto build a stack to survive
[2022-12-10 01:46:52] <+chongliwins> many people here may not get the reference that Nemo seemingly tried to 12k scam for her boyfriend

[2022-12-10 01:47:00] <trckdck> @highrockz And we often talk about how much money people bet on each turn in big blinds. And how much totalt chips we have on the table. If you have for example under 20 big blinds (BB's), then you have little money let to play with, and you're then forced to play bad hands.
[2022-12-10 01:47:03] <yng_quikz> Where can we see the cards

[2022-12-10 01:55:39] <weknbek> @trckdck 8 outs, times two for turn and river, means 16*2.25% so yeah roughly 32%
[2022-12-10 01:55:41] <+PawnMasseur> @betenjan probably, a call wouldnt be a big mistake, too.. not 100% sure tbh
[2022-12-10 01:55:42] <+whotookkaliudus> it's not soccer

[2022-12-10 02:04:09] <%+dukeof007> The reports of my retirement have been greatly exaggerated…. Lol
[2022-12-10 02:04:09] <+principle22> cause poker you play with your own money.
[2022-12-10 02:04:10] <alistair12321> @thegreatdanton9 nah i didnt lol. but its still nothing compared to chess engine
[2022-12-10 02:04:18] <Hikaruswife> yes
[2022-12-10 02:04:19] <%1________chess_> stop folding
[2022-12-10 02:04:23] <Hulkiorra> Does it help to play poker in person to see who's bluffing?
[2022-12-10 02:04:23] <jew_gotti> @principle22 not always lol

[2022-12-10 02:04:34] <owenwafflez> Damn i missed it
[2022-12-10 02:04:37] <trckdck> @passedpawn9999 Nah, you can't, but you can calculate it. Calculate the odds for X hitting on the river. And for what cards/range of cards the opinion has, based on play in the hand or over a number of hands. Just like what your opinion does on the chess table. You cannot predict what your opinion does to a 100% degree in chess.

[2022-12-10 02:04:39] <thegreatdanton9> @alistair12321 you don’t lose a penny losing a chess game online
[2022-12-10 02:04:41] <SexPill> if you sit down at a table with 5 people assume they are all friends
[2022-12-10 02:04:42] <yogishyam> Poker is harder cuz more people loose their life to it

[2022-12-10 02:05:34] <+wachinpntdry> poker is hard wheneveryone at the table is willing to shove with any 2 cards against you for %k
[2022-12-10 02:05:37] <+whotookkaliudus> @GMHikaru to settle a bet with someone, would you consider chess to be a sport
[2022-12-10 02:05:40] <betenjan> @quasiintellectual thats only if you want to be really really really good
[2022-12-10 02:05:40] <theshorebird> Is there or can there be a gambling element like Poker to Chess?
[2022-12-10 02:05:40] <trckdck> @yogishyam Nah, that's just cause people sit down to gamble, and then there are others on the table who are not "gamblers", but "players".
[2022-12-10 02:05:46] <+namshubCR> people curious abt poker complexity should google game theory optimal poker
[2022-12-10 02:05:48] <reyteo> whos better at poker you or magnus?
[2022-12-10 02:05:52] <Rackbone> with 20bb you should definitely play less hands

[2022-12-10 02:06:04] <stilltoasty> Would you consider chess a sport or hobby
[2022-12-10 02:06:04] <%$tlingitshark> doyle brunsons super system he says to limp in with aces under the gun and wait for someone to raise then push all in,,,,lol
[2022-12-10 02:06:04] <+valyrie12> @reyteo Magnus is 2800 in poker
[2022-12-10 02:06:05] <dgilzzz> hey gm hikaru. I grind poker daily, and am a huge lurking chess fan, (watch videos before bed, etc) your assessment is very accurate! super similar, but RNG/nash equilibrium brings a different aspect
[2022-12-10 02:06:06] <SexPill> @whotookkaliudus not even close ive got way better

[2022-12-10 02:06:13] <+quasiintellectual> @GMHikaru If you had the possibility to re-skill all your points/time put in to chess in to anything else, would you do it and what would it be?
[2022-12-10 02:06:19] <Rackbone> anything close to 15bb you should start considering all in equity
[2022-12-10 02:06:21] <+wachinpntdry> fine*

[2022-12-10 02:06:40] <bigdeezyseventhreezy> You don’t need to be remotely close to the top to make a living. Some card rooms have the worst players of all time. You can easily make 100k playing small games like 2/3 NL

[2022-12-10 02:07:16] <thegreatdanton9> 79 is the best hand against AA
[2022-12-10 02:07:18] <alistair12321> you'll find a lot of that in freerolls...
[2022-12-10 02:07:21] <trckdck> If you PLAY poker, you can be guaranteed profitable if you can find, and play with, people that GAMBLE poker. If you PLAY poker vs others who PLAY poker, it's gonna be a lot harder to actually win.

[2022-12-10 02:11:27] <Lasauce101> good fold
[2022-12-10 02:11:27] <808laharl> but it's also from the loose cannon
[2022-12-10 02:11:28] <+PawnMasseur> borderline..
[2022-12-10 02:11:28] <aveo_3> fold was the correct move
[2022-12-10 02:11:29] <%benkenobi1_618> good fold
[2022-12-10 02:11:32] <8anmyr> No delay??

[2022-12-10 02:11:36] <lol_e_pop> Not a bad fold
[2022-12-10 02:11:37] <+wachinpntdry> KJ soooted... insta shove
[2022-12-10 02:11:39] <aveo_3> you have 13bbs you dont need to vs UTG
[2022-12-10 02:11:41] <okbennis11> no that is the right lay down man
[2022-12-10 02:11:43] <aveo_3> better to openshove or fold
[2022-12-10 02:11:45] <trckdck> @seun__ What did he fold, and in what position was he?
[2022-12-10 02:11:46] <luciiii90> good fold??
[2022-12-10 02:11:46] <dgilzzz> can fold vs UTG but jamming ok as well
[2022-12-10 02:11:46] <%+Leveret2> it is all about the game tree. taking exploitive ways is still easier these days in poker than in chess in I guess
[2022-12-10 02:11:48] <@%+WanderingBishop> @justinelfalconi because the marketing made it clear they were bounties, and bounties aren't guaranteed to be collected, pretty clear
[2022-12-10 02:11:53] <%benkenobi1_618> KJ gambling hand
[2022-12-10 02:11:53] <alistair12321> you have zero fold equity tho
[2022-12-10 02:11:54] <%+dukeof007> Raise by VieH…. Not setious
[2022-12-10 02:11:55] <okbennis11> KJ suited under the gun i absoutley insta fold

[2022-12-10 02:12:47] <aveo_3> With one double up, you are the 2nd-3rd biggest stack on the table. Hence you ARENT desperate. You dont need to shoved KJs vs UTG. Better find a better spot
[2022-12-10 02:12:47] <%benkenobi1_618> is a gamble against that guy
[2022-12-10 02:12:49] <okbennis11> I agree euforia
