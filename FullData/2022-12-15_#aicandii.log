[2022-12-15 16:59:22] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> you're selling it
[2022-12-15 16:59:27] <%Grissbe> you are selling 1
[2022-12-15 16:59:28] <Rai_32> negative in trade means your selling
[2022-12-15 16:59:30] <%GrayOfSloth> thats yours

[2022-12-15 17:01:50] <%GrayOfSloth> if you research fabrication you can craft components

[2022-12-15 17:05:23] <Rai_32> i think?
[2022-12-15 17:06:01] <%Grissbe> imo its worth opening ancient danger even with bows as weapons, you just need to make corridor with  some traps inside it first

[2022-12-15 17:06:46] <%Grissbe> btw you can get new people from inside of it
[2022-12-15 17:06:57] <cyanidentity> Work priority in vanilla is a bit weird to get used to for sure
[2022-12-15 17:07:09] <Legendary_V> i think you can peek in ancient dangers by deconstructing wall in the corner

[2022-12-15 17:15:44] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> there is a stat called "manipulation" which determines work speed and success rate of a lot of tasks
[2022-12-15 17:15:59] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> if they work in drakness, or injured, they have lower manipulation

[2022-12-15 17:22:46] <Ashardalonn> thick roof
[2022-12-15 17:22:47] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> basically natural roof
[2022-12-15 17:22:56] <Ashardalonn> but a support within 9 tiles and your good
[2022-12-15 17:23:11] <Ashardalonn> or was it 5?
[2022-12-15 17:23:13] <%TanyMeteor> there are 2 types of roofs: thin and thick roofs, and if the thick roof collapses a bunch of rocks spawn and your colonists could die if one of the rocks falls on them lol
[2022-12-15 17:23:15] <petricorian> projec486Wave
[2022-12-15 17:23:16] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> Walls have a like 6 tiles range where they support roof, any more and the roof collapses, and it can injured pawns under it
[2022-12-15 17:23:23] <%Grissbe> i think it was 5
[2022-12-15 17:23:41] <%Grissbe> we are talking about guys mining
[2022-12-15 17:23:42] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> yeye you're fine
[2022-12-15 17:24:04] <Ashardalonn> the storage room is fine without pillars
[2022-12-15 17:24:05] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> iirc the biggest roofed room you can do without additinal support is 13*13
[2022-12-15 17:24:12] <%TanyMeteor> yeah you'll be fine in your colony, your colony also has thin roofs around it too so worst case scenario they'll just get cut or something

[2022-12-15 17:26:10] <%shiloh_freude> yeah if you add a bill task in the cremator
[2022-12-15 17:26:10] <%TanyMeteor> gotta set up bills on the crematorium and make sure the corpses are in range
[2022-12-15 17:26:15] <%shiloh_freude> you can burn corpses

[2022-12-15 17:27:51] <%shiloh_freude> just FYI allow fresh can sometimes make pawns burn animal corpses too instead of butchering
[2022-12-15 17:27:54] <Dienwald> i would keep the corpse in the freezer for the warg to snacc on
[2022-12-15 17:27:56] <cyanidentity> Careful not to burn all your hunted animals
