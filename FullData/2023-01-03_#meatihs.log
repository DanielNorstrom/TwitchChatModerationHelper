[2023-01-03 00:00:22] <+reaperonetho> art != politics
[2023-01-03 00:00:28] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> my first thought is: he needs a mental health intervention

[2023-01-03 00:00:52] <sonofman1930> Yeah it's not good to hate another race or bring up Hitler when you don't understand what he did.
[2023-01-03 00:00:52] <+reaperonetho> wow that's the best opening hand

[2023-01-03 00:06:33] <%+oribasius> The thing with that statement "you can't hate someone for being who they are" is that it essentially simplifies to "you can't hate someone."  And that's probably a useful world view.  It does seem appropriate to call out behavior that harms other people.  Hate shouldn't come into it.  It's never useful.  Trying to understand someone and offering kindness is going to yield the best results.

[2023-01-03 00:08:08] <@DerPeetz> this is something you have to differ. if youre hating someone for what they cant change they are,youre just a douchebag...if you hate someone for what they chose to become, it can be justified and right.
[2023-01-03 00:08:17] <+noir_light> #1!
[2023-01-03 00:08:32] <rasttsar> Why do people play at #1?
[2023-01-03 00:08:40] <@%MightyKingPin> @DerPeetz why are you here and i have to run the goombas ? meatiThug meatiThug
[2023-01-03 00:08:46] <Poke_it_with_a_stick> because its january 2nd and doesn't matter
[2023-01-03 00:08:49] <Absird> It's always a choice because hate must be practiced. Frustration may occur outside of our control and affect our subconcious bias, but hate must be cultivated.
[2023-01-03 00:08:51] <sonofman1930> I;m actually trying to save lives for another reason too. So I'm going into the medical field.
[2023-01-03 00:08:52] <Hebceb8> because day 2 rank 1 is fake rank 1
[2023-01-03 00:08:52] <synesthesia171> @rasttsar why would he not play? lol
[2023-01-03 00:09:01] <+Assertonsin> hate is a strong word man

[2023-01-03 00:09:47] <Marxeyy> But the statement also implies that people are unable to change, in this case Kanye. Is it really ok to not get someone the help needed, and instead asserting that their individual autonomi should be respected?
[2023-01-03 00:10:07] <%Sevel07> @nerazzurri_ and? xd
[2023-01-03 00:10:21] <nerazzurri_> just saying thats how the hidden MMR works
[2023-01-03 00:10:38] <%Sevel07> yeah n he knows that and is playing
[2023-01-03 00:10:43] <nerazzurri_> yea
[2023-01-03 00:10:46] <+reaperonetho> it's not "hidden MMR" it's just MMR
[2023-01-03 00:10:48] <sonofman1930> I enjoy the music Kanye provided but I don't like his viewpoint about him loving hitler.
[2023-01-03 00:10:48] <rasttsar> just go next server at that point
[2023-01-03 00:10:48] <%Sevel07> what's your point
[2023-01-03 00:10:51] <LETSGO_BRANDON69> just because someone says something you don't like doesn't mean the person needs "help".

[2023-01-03 01:01:15] <+Softcorps_dn> draw 5 cards instead of 4
[2023-01-03 01:01:16] <gronkbong> nerf its draws
[2023-01-03 01:01:16] <@z_whitte> 5 draws first step
[2023-01-03 01:01:16] <%+Simylol> first stage 5 cards seems obv
[2023-01-03 01:01:18] <IdoGody> why is it 1 mana for 10 damage on average?
[2023-01-03 01:01:20] <bitbangboom> its fine
[2023-01-03 01:01:20] <!XyoJun> This is one of the worst meta, BG is better than Standard LUL
[2023-01-03 01:01:21] <@McBanterFace> first stage to 5 would be a huge nerf, makes sense
[2023-01-03 01:01:22] <%mthd4s> brand shouldnt be this strong
[2023-01-03 01:01:26] <bumbumbacsi_> its even worse its more reductions

[2023-01-03 01:01:48] <!%Carlthuzad> remember when they nerfed shaman's quest card LUL

[2023-01-03 01:01:53] VIEWERS: 1¬†375
[2023-01-03 01:01:54] <@z_whitte> but then instead of nerfing you're rebuilding the card
[2023-01-03 01:01:59] <gronkbong> is not brand the problem is that shit ton of draw that he has
[2023-01-03 01:02:14] <IdoGody> better make brand 2 and that stablizes it already by a lot, maybe 1 more little nerf but than its a in a great spot
[2023-01-03 01:02:14] <nerazzurri_> i like DH gameplay, it plays cards in its deck and plays to its outs
[2023-01-03 01:02:19] <nerazzurri_> perfect HS deck imo
[2023-01-03 01:02:41] <IcyMcSp1cy> just nerf unleash fel and warband by 1 mana and the deck is dead
[2023-01-03 01:02:42] <IdoGody> dh/rogue are amazing rn to play with

[2023-01-03 21:50:31] <@zridex> on tinder and online dating in general, women vastly outperform men. so for one night stands, women have it easier
[2023-01-03 21:50:32] <TankKommando> its easier for an handsome guy as well
[2023-01-03 21:50:32] <sampeppu> isnt tinder like 10% womem tho :D
[2023-01-03 21:50:39] <%+chuuwire> I'm going to be honest, if you're average or below average as a guy, dating apps are not going to work for you. You need to get out in the world
[2023-01-03 21:50:42] <@zridex> but i think for getting relationship, its harder for women
[2023-01-03 21:50:50] <girthySenpai> tinder is 75% bots, and that seems low
[2023-01-03 21:51:06] <bigkalos> I appreciate your opinion but every gender study has proven this.

[2023-01-03 21:56:48] <usedmonkeys650> Though the brain may be done growing in size, it does not finish developing and maturing until the mid- to late 20s. The front part of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, is one of the last brain regions to mature.

[2023-01-03 21:59:10] <@zridex> the prefrontal cortex finishes developing at 25 so you get better at executive functions, but not higher iq. your iq doesnt increase, but you get better tools to use your iq

[2023-01-03 22:01:49] <Giggle_hs> i think intelligence and wisdom are two very different things. you may be "smarter" at 20 but you're a hell of a lot less wise.

[2023-01-03 22:03:21] <Giggle_hs> @synesthesia171 i dont disagree but thats why most people at age 20 are dipshits, which is my argument

[2023-01-03 22:31:50] <FreakOTheLair> Crystalized intelligence is mastery of learned concepts, as opposed to natural talent
[2023-01-03 22:31:50] <@SteveFrenchHS> peepoClown
[2023-01-03 22:31:53] <%+oribasius> But the problem with this question about IQ peaking is that IQ measurement is largely based on speed of responses - accuracy too, but a lot of it is speed.  and I'd argue that people develop deeper critical thinking skills later in life, even if they might not be processing it as quickly.
[2023-01-03 22:31:54] <@zridex> what? its more like intelligence is a complex thing
