[2022-12-07 17:44:47] <acetic_> yeah, might feel fine SC but holy fuck i'll get randomly oneshot dashing around the map with 15% elusive

[2022-12-07 17:45:04] <bstardpriest> @betterthanyouineveryway probably better to start SRS and then switch to AW when you get necessary gear
[2022-12-07 17:45:09] <HolaBolaLOL> @n0emotes whithering step does not reset eluisive anymore
[2022-12-07 17:45:10] <Llynok> Wasp Nest might go up to like, 3 or even 4c because of Venom Gyre monkaChrist
[2022-12-07 17:45:14] <Fientelo> I feel like I missed something, wondering why frost blades doesn't seem to be on anyones table
[2022-12-07 17:45:15] <mi53ry> @n0emotes you can't reset elusive with withering step anymore so like a 30% damage nerf
[2022-12-07 17:45:15] <Xenonic_Gaming> is warcry piano the only way to play slams? i kinda wanna try volcanic fissure but idk anything about slams monkaChrist
[2022-12-07 17:45:19] <BunnyCompany> @betterthanyouineveryway yes but playstyle is not for all, only if you already played and enjoy it
[2022-12-07 17:45:20] <Davonosx> I'm thinking of going flicker strike as a starter, thoughts?
[2022-12-07 17:45:21] <n0emotes> feels ok
[2022-12-07 17:45:23] <acetic_> @itskevinb0ss pconc feels like trash on bosses, you're better off doing something else for pinnacles
[2022-12-07 17:45:24] <@%Andrew756> so fast Jebaited
[2022-12-07 17:45:29] <acetic_> though it's not impossible
[2022-12-07 17:45:34] <@%Andrew756> placebo effect
[2022-12-07 17:45:36] <RAVENDomq> hey, whatd u think chance tear or purity on ruthless its a good idea?
[2022-12-07 17:45:48] <+Tsaebahcus007> @acetic_ curse changes are huge for pconc though
[2022-12-07 17:45:49] <qimrx> what's your ascendency point taken @nugiyen ?
[2022-12-07 17:46:11] <acetic_> @acetic_ it's huge, but it's still a skill check on most pinnacles at 1m dps or so
[2022-12-07 17:46:16] <Hamazulen> aoe @qimrx
[2022-12-07 17:46:17] <Nocturnaaal> Tru face of FrankerZ

[2022-12-07 17:46:41] <+Tsaebahcus007> @acetic_ very easy to get a few mil though before u do pinnacle no?
[2022-12-07 17:46:51] <itskevinb0ss> @acetic_ yeah, that's the most important thing im worry about rn
[2022-12-07 17:46:55] <+borg77_> I really want to try a poisen flicker at some point this league
[2022-12-07 17:47:06] <tiagovash> hey @nugiyen do u think it is a good idea to have your old sub "song" as a channel point reward? i kind of miss it... gimme gimme
[2022-12-07 17:47:15] <%Enttick> do you think that the SSF experience is better this league?
[2022-12-07 17:47:19] <BunnyCompany> @Waaghbafet just play poe with your kid BabyRage
[2022-12-07 17:47:25] <dbtfmd> why are so many people going poison this league?
[2022-12-07 17:47:40] <captainlance9> I must continue my research purposes across the lands, gl with the rest of your practice run sir!
[2022-12-07 17:47:45] <%Enttick> @dbtfmd temporal chains
[2022-12-07 17:47:50] <tiagovash> oooh that's why it was gone? @nugiyen sorry i didnt know
[2022-12-07 17:47:52] <Llynok> because poison is still really good, and hex changes
[2022-12-07 17:47:53] <dbtfmd> ah
[2022-12-07 17:48:02] <playlifee> Because poisons will have 20% more dmg + temp chains
[2022-12-07 17:48:12] <captainlance9> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:48:15] <acetic_> @acetic_ yes and no, depends how fast you can get a cherubims or dendrobate, and how well you can play with ~50k ehp and no phys reduction
[2022-12-07 17:48:15] <MasterEmpun> wouldnt a quick look at shop there for a 4link be worth 10 secounds?

[2022-12-07 17:48:44] <acetic_> @itskevinb0ss if you're worried about pinnacle dps, play pconc until you get to pinnacles then evaluate market

[2022-12-07 17:49:56] <riddibundus> @nugiyen what do you recomend to play for ruthless
[2022-12-07 17:49:58] <Theorycraftertv> @XaiTV join me in trade YEP
[2022-12-07 17:50:05] <HolaBolaLOL> stay in softcore
[2022-12-07 17:50:06] <betterthanyouineveryway> I'm playing HC because league mechanic looks HC friendly
[2022-12-07 17:50:07] <@%XaiTV> @Theorycraftertv I'd rather play Ruthless
[2022-12-07 17:50:09] <Tyun1> @nugiyen hey, gonna play ruthless ?
[2022-12-07 17:50:15] <+Hoerman__> aren't the beast crafts crafting changes?
[2022-12-07 17:50:16] <acetic_> @Llynok bow whirling blades PogChamp
[2022-12-07 17:50:17] <+boringname91> Those fracture orbs could make crafting a breeze depending on drop rate
[2022-12-07 17:50:23] <Izztar> Worth it to do library for shield charge?
[2022-12-07 17:50:28] <ezce_chr42> Math behind the Plague Bearer's 20% increased max value is roughly 650 dps more at gem level 6 and roughly 1000 dps more at gem level 8. These numbers assume damage starts at max incubation value.
[2022-12-07 17:50:28] <Theorycraftertv> @XaiTV Depending on context I'd take it as a compliment KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:50:30] <spndx> what is the mapping idea? venom gyre or else?
[2022-12-07 17:50:34] <TheLogicFan> Do we know if the sanctum is only in maps? Or can we do it while leveling?
[2022-12-07 17:50:35] <Doctorvaal> how do you get regen in this build
[2022-12-07 17:50:43] <acetic_> library, if no mule
[2022-12-07 17:50:43] <+jdogg000> library
[2022-12-07 17:50:46] <mi53ry> library
[2022-12-07 17:50:57] <Dhako87> act 6 is ok
[2022-12-07 17:50:58] <captainlance9> anyways, back to my research, data must be collected elsewhere peepoRun
[2022-12-07 17:50:59] <acetic_> else i think can mule a duelist for prot totem + shield charge
[2022-12-07 17:51:07] <HolaBolaLOL> in ssf lib
[2022-12-07 17:51:15] <%JuniperAngel> @TheLogicFan Act I
[2022-12-07 17:51:23] <mi53ry> some think it's worth doing library some just go without sheild charge till act 6 and get it
[2022-12-07 17:51:24] <kaladin_althor> captainlance9 im guessing you are working on bait/no bait vid pepegeThink
[2022-12-07 17:51:25] <acetic_> you can also just drop the gem PEPW

[2022-12-07 17:52:12] <acetic_> yeah if you don't mind the free respecs, i just swap off the two nodes when i'm pathed near the chaos wheel
[2022-12-07 17:52:13] <TheLogicFan> @JuniperAngel Are you sure?
[2022-12-07 17:52:25] <spndx> isnt this banner for melee skills :?

[2022-12-07 17:52:45] <BunnyCompany> @nugiyen do you want make cab with poison scaling?
[2022-12-07 17:52:57] <HolaBolaLOL> i want the new Content.ggpk rn
[2022-12-07 17:53:05] <!%+KayH9> Nuts
[2022-12-07 17:53:16] <spndx> @spndx okay
[2022-12-07 17:53:44] <%JuniperAngel> I really want to do occultist solely because I want to play with curses, but trickster seems almost better in every way.

[2022-12-07 17:54:16] <HolaBolaLOL> why pathfinder cab instead of trickster?!
[2022-12-07 17:54:33] <tiagovash> i never did a trickster buld ever poe since 2013
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <ezce_chr42> Pathfinder can scale onslaught flasks now.
[2022-12-07 17:54:58] <+magshen> buy why
[2022-12-07 17:55:04] <@%Zizaran> hey
[2022-12-07 17:55:07] <+Tsaebahcus007> good dam good flasks good qol
[2022-12-07 17:55:07] <booishmonk> because it is good
[2022-12-07 17:55:11] <axlex2> damage, utility, survivability, extra questions from chat
[2022-12-07 17:55:11] <Swageroni_> it's weird pl ask about pathfinder given how it actually has poison related stuff to it
[2022-12-07 17:55:12] <%+DutyMarv> Zuz
[2022-12-07 17:55:18] <!%warfirev> Does it ever give you up?
[2022-12-07 17:55:22] <BunnyCompany> @nugiyen also, thought on new flasks, look op or at least very strong
[2022-12-07 17:55:22] <@%Zizaran> do you use the usb extenders u usually bring over for cooking streams or could we borrow those
[2022-12-07 17:55:30] <+Flamingrabbits> just get a mageblood tho Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:55:34] <+TheodenArratay> youre just prepping for steels new flask Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:55:34] <+squid997> @nugiyen People ask this because they want to know the Logic behind your decisions because they respect it.  They are looking to learn/be swayed
[2022-12-07 17:55:35] <%+faijasmutsi> pathfinder + divination distillate + nugi, name a more iconic trio
[2022-12-07 17:55:35] <Llynok> the free stats for doing what you're already doing
[2022-12-07 17:55:41] <%JuniperAngel> Trickster is just insane for cold DoT, especially since swift killer gives 100% 5 frenzy uptime on bosses. Polymath is insane map sustain, and then obvious trickster tankiness.
[2022-12-07 17:55:42] <+Bassxx> I always remember Nugi playing pathfinder blade vortex against malachai in red map
[2022-12-07 17:55:42] <MasterEmpun> Pathfinder/Occultist/Elementalist is my top 3 favorit ascendancy
[2022-12-07 17:55:42] <Leonelidas89> Is PC viable for endgame bosses? or need to swap to other poison skill?
