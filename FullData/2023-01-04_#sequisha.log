[2023-01-04 14:12:18] <%+Big_Labo> yeah it'll default to certain speakers
[2023-01-04 14:12:19] <aramsham> would be nice for all this if they had like an in game sound test under audio, just to make sure
[2023-01-04 14:12:24] <neeskens88> @ohhimarket saabWave

[2023-01-04 14:13:00] <kryonid> so what we just heard was windows sonic + binaural audio? Cause that sounded way better than earlier
[2023-01-04 14:13:00] <%jinxplayer> Gillendor it was, but they changed the base audio system so it is a different fucked
[2023-01-04 14:13:04] <%jinxplayer> true kooz

[2023-01-04 16:18:51] <%+VagtasticVoyage420> @Sequisha how to do the spatial fix ?
[2023-01-04 16:18:56] <%supswervey> any spatial audio plugin should work well because it adds that depth of sound the game seemed to be missing
[2023-01-04 16:19:00] <%+R1NGER> I just tuned in, what spatial fix we talking about?
[2023-01-04 16:19:11] <%JohnDoeRadio> use either. sonic works for headphones on your win pc also.
[2023-01-04 16:19:16] <CrowFlies00> So my question is: If this is the case, wouldn't they fix the audio issue if it was a mistake this patch? So buying this DTS would be wasting money right?

[2023-01-04 17:00:45] <quinnwasmighty> Was this a fix from BSG or just someone passed it around?
[2023-01-04 17:00:46] <%Drostep> Probably because most headsets now come with that software built in
[2023-01-04 17:00:46] <%+Mylifetogive> wait did we fix audio? seqPog

[2023-01-04 17:00:54] <+Lag_Spiked> wait, did they fix the sound?
[2023-01-04 17:00:54] <%NerooYamato> you need to test it in interchange which was the worse
[2023-01-04 17:00:57] <shamshamalam> how did you fix audio?
[2023-01-04 17:00:58] <%faxwell_modemus> oh hell yeah

[2023-01-04 22:15:07] <%oklahomey> @EmeraldTiger888 scav are either AI or players can roll in with a random scav loadout later in the round. players bring in their own kit
[2023-01-04 22:15:16] <+Snow_Shinobi> @EmeraldTiger888 Scavs are AI, player scavs are random loadouts the player has access to every 15 min (the time can vary)

[2023-01-04 23:06:13] <+reynolds515> @rragythevigilante the 3090 is only 2ish years old, and most people could barely get one when it was released because of the shortage. so I can't imagine games have improved so much to make them obsolete yet
