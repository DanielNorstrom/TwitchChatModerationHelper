[2023-01-06 09:24:08] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying so if the opening was played poorly but the middlegame was fine, this could still be a grandmaster game. A famous grandmaster named Magnus Carlsen sometimes plays very bad openings, which could be played by a 500 rated player on lichess. Then somehow, he still manages to win. This is evidence that openings are overrated. For people that dont know what lichess is, it is the seconds largest website for online chess.
[2023-01-06 09:24:15] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Also, don't forget that the games Magnus Carlsen plays with bad/weird openings, are played against strong grandmasters. Grandmaster is the highest title to achieve in chess. For example, a bad opening could be something like: 1. g4 d5 2. h3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6
[2023-01-06 09:24:23] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Another famous opening in the game of chess is the Bongcloud. The boncloud is known as 1. e4 e5 2. Ke2. Also there is a boncloud draw line, which was first played by Magnus Carlsen (Considerably the GOAT) against Hikaru Nakamaru (Speed chess Champion). This line goes 1. e4 e5 2. Ke2 Ke7 3. Ke1 Ke8 4. Ke2 Ke7. This has now become a so called 'meme' , which is a term used by gen Z for joke. This was Boncloud history in a nutshell
[2023-01-06 09:24:29] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Also, in chess there is a discussion about what is better; the knight or the bishop? The knight can be very strong in closed positions, which can lead from a kings indian defense, or an advance french. The bishop on the other hand, can see more squares, which makes it so usually the bishop is better in endgames, because of the open space. An endgame is the last part of the game where there are a low amount of pieces left. What do you think is better? The knight or the bishop?
[2023-01-06 09:24:34] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying There is a few different ways to end the game of chess. Most commonly, a checkmate or by flagging your opponent. Checkmate is when the king is under attack, and it is not able to get the attack blocked or move the king. Also, if the attacking piece gets captured, the danger is gone and there is no checkmate. Next up, flagging. Flagging is basically when your opponent runs out of time on the chess clock. Then you could say that you 'flagged' your opponent.

[2023-01-06 12:40:23] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying so if the opening was played poorly but the middlegame was fine, this could still be a grandmaster game. A famous grandmaster named Magnus Carlsen sometimes plays very bad openings, which could be played by a 500 rated player on lichess. Then somehow, he still manages to win. This is evidence that openings are overrated. For people that dont know what lichess is, it is the seconds largest website for online chess.
[2023-01-06 12:40:31] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Also, don't forget that the games Magnus Carlsen plays with bad/weird openings, are played against strong grandmasters. Grandmaster is the highest title to achieve in chess. For example, a bad opening could be something like: 1. g4 d5 2. h3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6
[2023-01-06 12:40:35] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Another famous opening in the game of chess is the Bongcloud. The boncloud is known as 1. e4 e5 2. Ke2. Also there is a boncloud draw line, which was first played by Magnus Carlsen (Considerably the GOAT) against Hikaru Nakamaru (Speed chess Champion). This line goes 1. e4 e5 2. Ke2 Ke7 3. Ke1 Ke8 4. Ke2 Ke7. This has now become a so called 'meme' , which is a term used by gen Z for joke. This was Boncloud history in a nutshell
[2023-01-06 12:40:42] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying Also, in chess there is a discussion about what is better; the knight or the bishop? The knight can be very strong in closed positions, which can lead from a kings indian defense, or an advance french. The bishop on the other hand, can see more squares, which makes it so usually the bishop is better in endgames, because of the open space. An endgame is the last part of the game where there are a low amount of pieces left. What do you think is better? The knight or the bishop?
[2023-01-06 12:40:45] <%CrumblyTitan> Essaying There is a few different ways to end the game of chess. Most commonly, a checkmate or by flagging your opponent. Checkmate is when the king is under attack, and it is not able to get the attack blocked or move the king. Also, if the attacking piece gets captured, the danger is gone and there is no checkmate. Next up, flagging. Flagging is basically when your opponent runs out of time on the chess clock. Then you could say that you 'flagged' your opponent.
