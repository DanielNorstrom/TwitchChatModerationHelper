[2022-12-11 01:13:38] <+Qosmo_> Corbett made legend 1 with that deck
[2022-12-11 01:13:43] <zantomun> a bunch of draw, the "discover a copy of a beast in your deck" guy, brann, and the spitter
[2022-12-11 01:13:54] <zantomun> the new manathirst draw is nice
[2022-12-11 01:14:19] <%davidmcg> bot?
[2022-12-11 01:14:29] <$SpykoNukov> yeah but my point wasn't simply the list, it's that I couldn"'t find a single indication that the deck is good in wild, especially since the nerfs, but imma keep looking
[2022-12-11 01:14:37] <$Timihash> Brilliant
[2022-12-11 01:14:50] <+WombatRingo> spitter needs to be 4

[2022-12-11 01:19:11] <zantomun> stream almost over FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-11 01:19:27] <+Qosmo_> @Timihash just play an opposition deck, it's strong against all this stereotypes, but is not fun
[2022-12-11 01:19:45] <ZoeGirl> @danehearth counterpoint: it was glowing green in his hand
[2022-12-11 01:19:47] <xhxs> i see glowy card i play
[2022-12-11 01:19:54] <@%Duje200> AAECAfHhBA/t4wT14wT+4wSC5AST5AS55gTR7QSO8QSI9gTE9gTg9gS29wS0gAW1gAWSkwUAAA== here for the duel lovers
[2022-12-11 01:19:59] <+charlesdotwin> aggreed.  also funny watching people mill a card when they had an aquatic in hand they could've tossed
[2022-12-11 01:20:02] <$SpykoNukov> yeah for some reason people seems to not get aquatic form ? I saw people play it on 0 mana at the end of their turn, and it wasn't in early rank, I was like diamond
[2022-12-11 01:20:08] <zantomun> same with big priests that have dredge and discover in hand, always dredge turn 1 instead of turn 2 to discover the 0 cost one
[2022-12-11 01:20:33] <zantomun> @SpykoNukov was it going to fatigue?
[2022-12-11 01:20:34] <+ladr0difiori> Hello! What do you think about this new rogue deck, will be nerfed?
[2022-12-11 01:21:03] <$SpykoNukov> @zantomun nah no risk of fatigue or overdraw, just fcking aquatic form at the end of t5-6
[2022-12-11 01:21:51] <$SpykoNukov> hey 1mana yeti won games back in classic, put somle respect on it
[2022-12-11 01:22:18] <umjev> @zantomun maybe they were blind
[2022-12-11 01:22:24] <Psyderman> so is manathirst just the omega mechanic from boomsday?
[2022-12-11 01:22:28] <umjev> you never know
[2022-12-11 01:22:49] <$SpykoNukov> @zantomun ahah yeah idk, didn't happened often but more than once and it really syriked me as weird
[2022-12-11 01:22:49] <umjev> @Psyderman basicially
[2022-12-11 01:22:50] <zantomun> yeah or the "upgrades at x mana" but doesnt change the card id
[2022-12-11 01:23:08] <Psyderman> weird
[2022-12-11 01:23:22] <zantomun> so i think if the card gets replayed it replays it using your current mana, and not the original card ID played
[2022-12-11 01:23:33] <zantomun> like Jace would
[2022-12-11 01:24:00] <$SpykoNukov> I think manathirst works differently than "upgrade at x" when they're replayed ? like if you play a fury rank1 then jace will replay it at this rank, even on 10, while if jace replay a manathirst it will gain the effect even if it didn't when you first played it
[2022-12-11 01:24:23] <$SpykoNukov> yea, exactly what @zantomun said
[2022-12-11 01:24:38] <DameNightmare> id play it and step
[2022-12-11 01:24:50] <DameNightmare> yu can combo wiht shark at 10
[2022-12-11 01:25:25] <+Qosmo_> too late
[2022-12-11 01:25:35] <+Onagni> was it not lethal?
[2022-12-11 01:25:40] <+Qosmo_> double branching
[2022-12-11 01:26:10] <$SpykoNukov> Kreygasm the dane combo
[2022-12-11 01:26:23] <+Onagni> shark > scabbs > astalor > shadowcaster > astalor is 32 dmg for 9 mana i think
[2022-12-11 01:26:40] <umjev> imagine paying mana for cards
[2022-12-11 01:26:48] <DameNightmare> balanced
[2022-12-11 01:26:49] <+Qosmo_> the dane's engine is On-Line
[2022-12-11 01:26:50] <$SpykoNukov> @Onagni nah alastor would only deal 8
[2022-12-11 01:26:57] <$Timihash> This haw to be a fcking bug
[2022-12-11 01:27:10] <+Onagni> @Onagni but shark would be double for 16 each right?
[2022-12-11 01:27:14] <+Guidoxten> and scabs astalor scabs?
[2022-12-11 01:27:46] <$SpykoNukov> @Onagni oh yeah, huh idk then you might be right
[2022-12-11 01:27:51] <ZoeGirl> Spirit of the shark is an undead beast now, the more you know
[2022-12-11 01:28:18] <$SpykoNukov> EZ Clap

[2022-12-11 01:28:53] <@^Nightbot> Dane has played another "last game" 204 times! Typical Dane 4Head
[2022-12-11 01:28:53] <zantomun> makes sense since theyre related to the loa
[2022-12-11 01:28:53] <$Timihash> redbeardROLL
[2022-12-11 01:28:54] <LiteraIlySatan> there's no way blizz just printed another homogenizing neutral win con after nerfing denathrius right?
[2022-12-11 01:29:06] <Atarum> broken card, that small indie company need nerf it
[2022-12-11 01:29:12] <zantomun> @literailysatan gotta sell packs
[2022-12-11 01:29:17] <$SpykoNukov> @LiteraIlySatan Alastor is way less dangerous than denat... in standard at least
[2022-12-11 01:29:18] <zantomun> theyve done this forever
[2022-12-11 01:29:32] <$SpykoNukov> isn't alastor a free legendary ?
[2022-12-11 01:29:39] <FenixDarkFlame> Alastor needs to deal 6 not 8
[2022-12-11 01:29:47] <$SpykoNukov> denat is
[2022-12-11 01:30:10] <Atarum> alastor not
[2022-12-11 01:30:13] <%GuapoPescado> well I guess alastor is on the bottom then
[2022-12-11 01:30:16] <$SpykoNukov> huh
[2022-12-11 01:30:21] <$SpykoNukov> thought it was
[2022-12-11 01:30:46] <+Qosmo_> they have done it since the very first relase
[2022-12-11 01:30:52] <ZoeGirl> casual 3 mana sprint
[2022-12-11 01:30:54] <$Timihash> Yahaar HAHAHAHA

[2022-12-11 01:31:48] <$SpykoNukov> oh yeah astalor isn't free, I got lucky then, cool I hope they nerf it (I like free dust)
