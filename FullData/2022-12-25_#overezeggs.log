[2022-12-25 02:23:44] <%+The_Cinnabun> Ok @OverEzEggs  Every Christmas Eve we would drive 30 miles out to my grandparents' house and have Christmas Eve with them. There was always lots of sandwichy foods (meats, cheeses, breads) and a couple dips. BUT - Santa wouldn't come until EVERYONE had a little bit of Oyster stew. So we had to slurp down some broth before Santa would come. Then we would go downstairs because someone had seen Santa out of THAT window, but as we were looking we'd hear bells upstairs, so we'd all run back upstairs
[2022-12-25 02:23:52] <%+The_Cinnabun> All the adults would be like OMG SANTA WAS JUST HERE

[2022-12-25 03:39:08] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> One thing I've seen a lot of like REALLY good artists suggest is doing studies of artists whose styles you like, it can be really helpful to try to replicate the style from a reference, prop not something for on stream, but maybe helpful?
[2022-12-25 03:39:17] <%AmusedBenga1> @antroz93 I prefer Hinata and Konan
[2022-12-25 03:39:20] <%$Jaccquee> No, would be a first buy
[2022-12-25 03:39:23] <$antroz93> okay so my reason for liking Tenten is a little odd. when the Naruto card game was going, the very first pack i got, she was the ONLY character card i actually got.
[2022-12-25 03:39:24] <!%operatorviera> I look foward to seeing the coloured line art

[2022-12-25 03:41:35] <%AmusedBenga1> @girlswearbeanies Sakura as a character is just...sub par. There are only a few moments in the show where she's actually useful. the rest of the time she kind of just sits on the sidelines and relies on Naruto to fix the problem.

[2022-12-25 03:42:37] <%AmusedBenga1> I mean. She trains under Tsunade. and still was useless like 90% of the time
[2022-12-25 03:42:44] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> I mean, I definitely think she's a little annoying, but her character growth arc is actually one of the most satisfying to me so far, at least from what I've watched

[2022-12-25 03:43:17] <%FallenAngel0103> she isnt useless

[2022-12-25 03:43:38] <%FallenAngel0103> not gonna get into spoils but she is NOT useless
[2022-12-25 03:43:40] VIEWERS: 217
[2022-12-25 03:43:46] <!%$CoopKaiju> I think her romance arc mega sucked, but her character arc was fine enough
[2022-12-25 03:43:47] <+Rattleboxttv> She has a classic cinematography role, her point is to be more relatable to the audience
[2022-12-25 03:43:51] <%MoltenNami> people really only call her useless because the internet has built such a funny haha useless thing for her so it's just the default to call her that
[2022-12-25 03:43:58] <%FallenAngel0103> its just that naruto and sasuke are GODS KEKW
[2022-12-25 03:44:00] <%$the_vowki> classic
[2022-12-25 03:44:03] <$girlswearbeanies> @girlswearbeanies there are just moments with her in the show i wanna cry for her like her being in love with a man that left her and her best friend does so much for her and she tries so hard just to try and help
[2022-12-25 03:44:03] <$antroz93> like Gaara and Temari wouldnt have a brother if not for her
[2022-12-25 03:44:06] <%FallenAngel0103> who can live up to fucking NARUTO
[2022-12-25 03:44:12] <%Misfit_Vandal> i wouldn't call Sakura useles, she became one of the Sanin and surpassed Tsunade as a Med Nin....not sure she is "useless"
[2022-12-25 03:44:21] <DonJuIiio> hey all, just came by to wish everyone a merry Christmas c:
[2022-12-25 03:44:22] <$girlswearbeanies> now ino however
[2022-12-25 03:44:35] <+Rattleboxttv> besides, her perspective is different

[2022-12-25 03:44:39] <+Rattleboxttv> which contributes a lot
[2022-12-25 03:44:40] <%$the_vowki> sasuke is a bitch ngl
[2022-12-25 03:44:51] <%FallenAngel0103> and she didnt have any special thing about her unlike naruto and sasuke
[2022-12-25 03:44:52] <!%operatorviera> I feel like she desevered more screen time to delevop more
[2022-12-25 03:45:05] <+Rattleboxttv> clearly the most useless character is Rock Lee
[2022-12-25 03:45:06] <+Vendramon_> id say kiba
[2022-12-25 03:45:10] <%FallenAngel0103> sasuke wasnt there 90% of the anime too KEKW
[2022-12-25 03:45:18] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> Honestly so far now that's she's learning the medical stuff she's been SUPER important to have in to help, she's also like, seriously just a normal person who's TRYING to do SOMETHING around literally the strongest people EVER, like she's annoying, but man, people can be annoying, her character arc has been SUPER satisfying
[2022-12-25 03:45:19] <%AmusedBenga1> Thats why I said 90%. that 10% was what was important. I will give her credit where its due for the training and being "normal".
[2022-12-25 03:45:20] <!%$CoopKaiju> I still think she was last to the "Naruto is good enough" train
[2022-12-25 03:45:20] <%$AToxicTwinkie> Plus her family wasn’t know to have such gifted chakra/ family traits
[2022-12-25 03:45:24] <%FallenAngel0103> ROCK LEE DESERVE HIS OWN ANIME

[2022-12-25 03:45:49] <+Vendramon_> the dug akumaru was a better character then kiba
[2022-12-25 03:45:50] <%Misfit_Vandal> how's Lee useless?.....he is one of the TOP Taijutsu users
[2022-12-25 03:45:55] <%FallenAngel0103> vow we wont spoil
[2022-12-25 03:45:58] <+Rattleboxttv> she is like Haku
[2022-12-25 03:45:58] <%MoltenNami> that's like calling someone useless because they aren't Goku
[2022-12-25 03:46:05] <%FallenAngel0103> dark hasnt either
[2022-12-25 03:46:12] <+Rattleboxttv> except haku strays from that role when it becomes clear Haku is actually pretty strong

[2022-12-25 03:46:36] <%$yaboibryeezy> fuuuuck
[2022-12-25 03:46:37] <%TaillessC> I think part of it is because she's slightly annoying but that's writer issues and because she isn't as "accomplished" as literal gods
[2022-12-25 03:46:42] <+Rattleboxttv> She is just overshadowed by neiji
[2022-12-25 03:46:49] <%FallenAngel0103> kiba was fucking useless
[2022-12-25 03:46:52] <%FallenAngel0103> bro was a furry
[2022-12-25 03:46:58] <%AmusedBenga1> I mean. They don't become "GODS" until later in the show. and don't forget at one point that Naruto was pretty much useless. Until he got proper training.
[2022-12-25 03:46:58] <+Rattleboxttv> When I called Lee useless I was just being a little shit

[2022-12-25 03:47:08] <!%$willrob87> let's be honest chi chi (gokus wife) was the real strongest in the series
[2022-12-25 03:47:09] <%Misfit_Vandal> ok, in regards of Ninja....Naruto and Sasuke are gods.....but as far as being dad's.....well
[2022-12-25 03:47:12] <$girlswearbeanies> i used to get bullied alot for comparing myself to sakura being friends with alot of men who were older then me they could do things i couldn't and i felt that weird connection hahahaha Sakura was everything i wanted to be growing up
[2022-12-25 03:47:16] <%MoltenNami> I feel like the only reason sakura is "usless" is just because she never had a funny hyper anime fight
[2022-12-25 03:47:25] <!%$CoopKaiju> If we talking hard work effort character, Lee outshines Sakura

[2022-12-25 04:42:18] <%MoltenNami> but the other one has like a mac keyboard so I image that one is for work
[2022-12-25 04:42:18] <+gothwomenenjoyer> the ultrawide could be for editing
[2022-12-25 04:42:20] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> I feel like the little white keyboard is the work one
