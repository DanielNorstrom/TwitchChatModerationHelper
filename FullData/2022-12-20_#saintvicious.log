[2022-12-20 01:24:50] <+Minimancer27> the scene at the end of rogue one with Vader was the most satifying star wars scene for me of all star wars

[2022-12-20 14:02:58] <+strawberry_wizard> they have to say they like it...because of the implication
[2022-12-20 14:03:00] <Jaydbhai> It depends on the girl really

[2022-12-20 14:03:20] <Jaydbhai> It depends on the girl
[2022-12-20 14:03:21] <+sebadurden> thats what a bronce would do
[2022-12-20 14:03:34] <empathyissue> today is a tricky relationship wise, either you get traditional girl and zero sex or you get crazy girl with huge body count and serious problems

[2022-12-20 14:04:41] <+pureTFT> because handholding is synonymous for some with commitment and shit and people are scared of that

[2022-12-20 14:04:58] <TheAlpineYeti> just talk during the movie and annoy everyone
[2022-12-20 14:04:59] <waterbottleKR> girls do that on blind dates if they dont like you

[2022-12-20 14:06:15] <Jokerfrowns> 100% my most recent date we both seemed to not be into the outdoor performance we were at - I said, "want to bail and smoke weed and chill at my place".  Went well.
[2022-12-20 14:06:16] <+Sincursus> I usually do coffee + park/somewhere to walk around for a first date.

[2022-12-20 14:08:21] <stinkydoodiediaper> Fair I guess first date thats what i did. After though we split or ya find someone else.
[2022-12-20 14:08:26] VIEWERS: 545
[2022-12-20 14:08:28] <ZenHarasaki> I think paying for the date adds a layer of implication that I typically don't want.
[2022-12-20 14:08:36] <+thigor1> Im not buying a girl drinks all night bruh, If we go for food or an event Ill pay for that but that shits expensive as fuck if they can handle their booze
[2022-12-20 14:08:51] <Bartthefartman> i remember a friend of mine told me that a guy took her out on a date and he paid but right after he told her to send him half of the bill via cashapp Kappa
[2022-12-20 14:08:52] <ZenHarasaki> Which is why I would default to cheap dates like coffee or lunch.
[2022-12-20 14:08:56] <empathyissue> then you dont date a girls who drink

[2022-12-20 15:37:58] <+orimc> It worked really well last set due to dragons being a special cost unit and being few of them but regular 4 cost are too many

[2022-12-20 16:23:36] <Xelltrix> They matter, they get your foot in the door. But they're not the only path to do that.
[2022-12-20 16:23:58] <+thigor1> you can leverage work experience just as much as a degree now, entry level bachelors/degrees helps a lot with foot in the door but if you just have a few years working a job with good references you will be fine
[2022-12-20 16:24:03] <%+joonroot> this augment seems broken

[2022-12-20 16:36:04] <+thigor1> thats like saying dudes who climb those huge towers dont put themselves at risk because they never fall, it's the inherent risk they subject themselves too which is the issue
[2022-12-20 16:36:08] <+BoostedWatty> ekoo > gp
[2022-12-20 16:36:13] <+BoostedWatty> nvm 6
[2022-12-20 16:36:22] <Xelltrix> That's not even close to the same.
[2022-12-20 16:36:36] <%+mintyhippo67> yeah climbing those towers is probably safer
[2022-12-20 16:36:39] <%+mintyhippo67> tbh
[2022-12-20 16:36:48] <Xelltrix> That's a high risk job with very high insurance premiums, electricians aren't high risk.
