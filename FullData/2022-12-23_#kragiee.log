[2022-12-23 12:25:51] <%sp33dyal> I think it's more efficient to go for his backline since they'll be busy pocketing ram though
[2022-12-23 12:26:01] <Muster_> his ult range is too big and he is too fast
[2022-12-23 12:26:13] <%sp33dyal> take some dmg from his ult as well but tracer has it rough with 150 hp
[2022-12-23 12:26:16] <+Mistahmamba> that ult does seem pretty nasty though
[2022-12-23 12:26:26] <%sp33dyal> Yeah def
[2022-12-23 12:26:30] <filipio26> @Muster_ thats not the main problem its just his block
[2022-12-23 12:26:42] <+Adrunath> @kragiee  what tank counters ramatra?
[2022-12-23 12:26:44] <petty_tendergrass> Yeah they’ll prob nerf range to offset speed boost buff
[2022-12-23 12:26:52] <filipio26> @Adrunath orisa
[2022-12-23 12:26:52] <%sp33dyal> ram is only amazing against other classes except snipers on dps
[2022-12-23 12:27:00] <+Mistahmamba> doesn't his ult make you do 50% less dmg?
[2022-12-23 12:27:01] <SadMatte> @Mistahmamba he has no health outside of gigachad form, so it forces him to use it or if he doesn't have it, he dies instantly
[2022-12-23 12:27:10] <Saxn> clean
[2022-12-23 12:27:16] <blue_laguna> how do u practice sticky? also is it always good to actually stick it or throw it on the ground depending on the situation?
[2022-12-23 12:27:19] <%sp33dyal> even against snipers i think when people get used to using his ground ability better they'll be fked as well

[2022-12-23 12:39:22] <Geoneiric> having cleanse and essentially a nano for entire team is invaluable

[2022-12-23 12:39:30] <+D_Imperor> @D_Imperor It's not Pay to win. It's a play wall
[2022-12-23 12:39:40] <%+anqzs_> this is why they need to nerf genji again
[2022-12-23 12:39:42] <Geoneiric> Personally I don't think she even needs invulnerability
[2022-12-23 12:39:43] <white_smokes> Who is better now soldier or sojourn
[2022-12-23 12:39:50] <+D_Imperor> You can get him for free but it takes a while. They gotta lower it
[2022-12-23 12:39:55] <Geoneiric> sojourn is better
[2022-12-23 12:39:55] <%+anqzs_> TrollDespair
[2022-12-23 12:39:56] <+D_Imperor> 45 is still too high
[2022-12-23 12:40:01] <akihiko80> ramattra really hurts
[2022-12-23 12:40:06] <+D_Imperor> 25-30 would be optimal IMO

[2022-12-23 12:40:16] <Geoneiric> no reason for a character to be in the battlepass
[2022-12-23 12:40:21] <Geoneiric> when the game revolves around swaps
[2022-12-23 12:40:21] <fardeen70> @D_Imperor they also lowered the level you can get him but also lowered the xp gained per match
[2022-12-23 12:40:44] <Geoneiric> integrally on a wrong level
[2022-12-23 12:40:57] <filipio26> Bro this ramattra tank form looks so goofy

[2022-12-23 12:41:25] <+D_Imperor> Free pass def feels slow but not slower IMO. Paid pass still feels the same idk. I do my dailies and weeklies and farm

[2022-12-23 12:41:42] <Geoneiric> dailies and stuff are crucial
[2022-12-23 12:42:00] <@%fwaash> you also have to land the shots PepeLaugh
[2022-12-23 12:42:10] <fardeen70> @D_Imperor i saw a vid where they showed that the xp gained per match is lowered this season
[2022-12-23 12:43:18] <+Greepine> Would u ever play in owl kragie?
[2022-12-23 12:43:27] VIEWERS: 1 111
[2022-12-23 12:44:04] <+D_Imperor> I'm not disputing what you are saying. I'm saying it doesn't feel slower TO ME since I do all my dailies and weeklies. If they do lower the character access and do the same thing with XP then I'll probably feel it even if I do dailies and weeklies
[2022-12-23 12:44:12] <+DashinGamer23> junkrat more like skillrat
[2022-12-23 12:45:12] <Geoneiric> @D_Imperor so let's just stick to the topic of the lowered battlepass xp

[2022-12-23 12:45:35] <filipio26> Your Ramattra sucks so bad
[2022-12-23 12:46:19] <+D_Imperor> @D_Imperor One week and some change on and off

[2022-12-23 12:47:03] <%sp33dyal> took me 2 weeks around the patch time to get to ramattra on the free bp with all dailys and weeklys that's why i'm asking
[2022-12-23 12:47:07] <Geoneiric> we would get the bad rammatra
[2022-12-23 12:47:09] <CassiHikari> Doesn't take long to level if you log in and do dailys+A weekly

[2022-12-23 14:35:47] <%Spitfire2k6> @zacku Nah your body has continued to make adenosine even though the caffine blocked you from feeling it, caffine doesn't wake you up. it pauses the sleepness

[2022-12-23 14:51:44] <@%^Nightbot> Hitscan is literally instantaneous, or the closest you can get it to instantaneous in the code. Since ashe doesn't hit as fast as possible, she is not a hitscan. There is nothing more to say
[2022-12-23 14:51:49] <+Octologist> @rookieh3re scoped in ana is hitscan, unscoped is projectile

[2022-12-23 14:53:11] <%+zerofl> sorry kragie not entirely correct. Hitscan is measured from whether your aim is hovering the enemy at the time you click, projectiles are well projectiles
[2022-12-23 14:53:15] <RustyRazy> Chatting
[2022-12-23 14:53:26] <%Spitfire2k6> Hitscan calculates the hit based on the target position at the time the shot is fired. Projectile doesn't it's that simple

[2022-12-23 14:54:21] <+Octologist> Ok I looked into it and apparently she IS a hitscan but has a delay from the time you click to the time the gun is fired, so the result is similar but it’s not a projectile in the same way as others

[2022-12-23 14:57:02] <%+zerofl> it litterally says hitscan on the wiki too. Hitscan can be delayed, but it does not have travel time.
[2022-12-23 14:57:02] <+Octologist> There is no travel time from when the bullet leaves the gun to when it hits the enemy, but there is a delay from the mouseclick to the gun firing

[2022-12-23 14:57:04] <TheVulgarBulgar> So she's not a hitscan

[2022-12-23 14:58:31] <@%emmy_ish> !joke
[2022-12-23 14:58:32] <rookieh3re> is bap hitsan?
[2022-12-23 14:58:32] <%zacku> soldier initially had spread instead of forced recoil
[2022-12-23 14:58:32] <@%^Nightbot> A quick shoutout to all of the sidewalks out there... Thanks for keeping me off the streets.
[2022-12-23 14:58:35] <+rinnequan> how many more wins until the next rank up?
[2022-12-23 14:58:40] <SillyAvo> thats what i thought i wonder why they gave him recoil
[2022-12-23 14:58:42] <+TheSickInfluenza> they probably did it so shes not just a better widow
[2022-12-23 14:58:42] <aBigSadPotato> Kiriko hitscan if she throws kunai hard enough

[2022-12-23 14:59:05] <El_manuelL> @kragiee the way you describe it then hitscan doesn't exist because every characters' gun takes a slight time to reach the target

[2022-12-23 14:59:12] <@%emmy_ish> @kaiber666 it's not one of nightbots best ones
[2022-12-23 14:59:12] <%zacku> he was playable with spread but the recoil made it extremely unfun
[2022-12-23 14:59:18] <spartanpr0ner> yeyeye

[2022-12-23 15:00:34] <%zacku> hHUH
[2022-12-23 15:00:38] <%+zerofl> @kragiee just explain projectiles = each bullet is a game object that travels in the air. Hitscan = instant, no bullet that travels as game object. Damage is registered instantly.
[2022-12-23 15:00:41] <spartanpr0ner> back to drilling ?

[2022-12-23 15:01:07] <SillyAvo> the floor is next
[2022-12-23 15:01:10] <HK_Shobu> are they using hitscan drills?
[2022-12-23 15:01:11] <El_manuelL> @kragiee I get it but I thought hitscan meant you didn't need to aim slightly ahead of the target if its moving (also called projectiles)
[2022-12-23 15:01:12] <+Rs_Tom> swiss cheese walls ?
[2022-12-23 15:01:15] <almondsaredope> Guys HITSCAN MEANS HIT SCAN AND PROJECTILE IS A PROJECTILES ITS IN THE NAMEE
[2022-12-23 15:01:16] <geckoEva> they want Swiss cheese walls
[2022-12-23 15:01:27] <+FFSmasher5> can you show ashe vs widow in practice range

[2022-12-23 15:02:14] <+Tetra_graph> isn't hitscan just shots that teleport to your area
[2022-12-23 15:02:17] <%+zerofl> projectiles have TRAVEL time
[2022-12-23 15:02:19] <marcusghh> google says "Hitscan in video game design, most commonly in first-person shooters, is a type of hit registration system that determines whether an object has been hit or not simply by scanning if the item used was aimed directly at its target and then applies the effects of the item instantly."
[2022-12-23 15:02:26] <%agiro01> afaik hitscan is instantenous, like a raycast, projectile has bullet travel speed
[2022-12-23 15:02:46] <%kaiber666> A lot of hitscan talk

[2022-12-23 15:03:08] <+winegodbacchus> That's a latency issue....
[2022-12-23 15:03:15] <%+zerofl> Ashe does not have travel time on her bullets no
[2022-12-23 15:03:18] <%Spitfire2k6> ^
[2022-12-23 15:03:20] <almondsaredope> He talking about ashe not hitscan heros
[2022-12-23 15:03:21] <El_manuelL> yes @kragiee but that is not the case with ashe
[2022-12-23 15:03:21] <+H_Fuller> is that latency, or travel time?
[2022-12-23 15:03:23] <VikingJackAU> ? There is no travel time with hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:03:24] <%Spitfire2k6> no it wont
[2022-12-23 15:03:28] <%+zerofl> show me
[2022-12-23 15:03:30] <FACOBSE69> bro
[2022-12-23 15:03:33] <%zacku> kephrri once said it’s not hitscan, tt’s a very fast projectile.
[2022-12-23 15:03:37] <almondsaredope> Ashe has travel time lol
[2022-12-23 15:03:37] <CoreroC> It cant be a latency issue if it's only happening to Ashe
[2022-12-23 15:03:43] <inkhearts> Congrats on the recent tournament win somnus1Wiggle
[2022-12-23 15:03:43] <+rinnequan> i swear ashe is projectile
[2022-12-23 15:03:43] <VikingJackAU> That's just a visual
[2022-12-23 15:03:50] <%agiro01> isn't it just the visual effect? it's usually different to the physics that handles hit registration
[2022-12-23 15:03:53] <%Spitfire2k6> just go into an ashe replay and slow it down
[2022-12-23 15:03:58] <%+zerofl> ok then shoot IN FRONT of someone and hit them, as you can with a PROJECTILE @kragiee
[2022-12-23 15:04:01] <VikingJackAU> That's just cosmetic effect
[2022-12-23 15:04:03] <yorandomman12> Guys do stats go toward your rank or mmr?
[2022-12-23 15:04:08] <FACOBSE69> cant tell if kragiee is trolling
[2022-12-23 15:04:09] <somnath85> then hanzo is definately not a hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:04:09] <+winegodbacchus> @kragiee You might have 1ms but there are other latency factors such as the enemy latency as well as internal server latency.
[2022-12-23 15:04:12] <GGRafufu> I searched and I read one article which kephri said something about a hyper projectile?
[2022-12-23 15:04:12] <FACOBSE69> like wtf
[2022-12-23 15:04:15] <%+zerofl> LEAD ur shot and hit a shot as ASHE @kragiee
[2022-12-23 15:04:16] VIEWERS: 1 590
[2022-12-23 15:04:17] <Theivid> but seeing the visual doesn't necesarily mean that it registers the hit later. It could still be pure hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:04:21] <yorandomman12> Do stats affect mmr and rank?*
[2022-12-23 15:04:25] <%zacku> ashe has input delay lol
[2022-12-23 15:04:26] <%+zerofl> Kragie for sure trolling
[2022-12-23 15:04:27] <almondsaredope> U can see the hitmarkers too lol, if u cant see and feel the bullet ur a beta
[2022-12-23 15:04:29] <%zacku> its been there since day 1
[2022-12-23 15:04:38] <%+zerofl> u gotta hit a target
[2022-12-23 15:04:47] <%kaiber666> Confused
[2022-12-23 15:05:02] <FACOBSE69> if it doesnt reigster its a server/latency issue not anythign to do with the bullet itself
[2022-12-23 15:05:02] <VikingJackAU> :tf:
[2022-12-23 15:05:05] <El_manuelL> @kragiee if thats the arguement, go cassidy soldier any hitscan that you consider you can still see the bullet
[2022-12-23 15:05:06] <%+zerofl> its VFX kragie
[2022-12-23 15:05:06] <+H_Fuller> oh shit
[2022-12-23 15:05:10] <+rinnequan> idk ashe shots just dont hit sometimes compared to soldier and cass
[2022-12-23 15:05:14] <%zacku> her ads is weird lol
[2022-12-23 15:05:15] <Neferu> @zerofl you actually have to. That's why her aim is different from other hitscans
[2022-12-23 15:05:17] <%kaiber666> kragie1 kragie2
[2022-12-23 15:05:21] <SamHPL_> I can't find anything recent about this, some people in 2020 said there was some experimental change that might've changed this, but I don't now
[2022-12-23 15:05:25] <+winegodbacchus> that's just a visual though. It doesn't change how the code works
[2022-12-23 15:05:28] <+H_Fuller> You've convinced me. lol
[2022-12-23 15:05:30] <%+zerofl> if u can LEAD ur shot in front of a moving target and hit it then its a projectile.
[2022-12-23 15:05:34] <%agiro01> its moving alright but isn't it just a linerenderer for visual effects? and the hit registration happened immediately
[2022-12-23 15:05:37] <+drcrazyjoker> Its a latency/visual issue, ashe is hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:05:39] <%$ketsune_tsuki> Ashe isnt hit scan
[2022-12-23 15:05:46] <GGRafufu> Can you try doing a headshot. If travel is just visual but damage took place even before that??
[2022-12-23 15:05:54] <seekersyzygy> @kragiee the bullet is only visual
[2022-12-23 15:05:55] <SillyAvo> is fast, but not instant
[2022-12-23 15:05:59] <%kaiber666> Uhhh
[2022-12-23 15:06:01] <%Spitfire2k6> What you see has no bearing on whether or not it's hitscan. that's just a visual
[2022-12-23 15:06:01] <almondsaredope> Guys u have to understand, some twitch chatters can never admit their weong sometimes
[2022-12-23 15:06:03] <rookieh3re> include cassidy and 76 in your comparison
[2022-12-23 15:06:05] <VikingJackAU> Why not shoot at a target? That's probably visual only
[2022-12-23 15:06:14] <FACOBSE69> Go into a repla ycode

[2022-12-23 15:06:30] <%+zerofl> @kragiee can u try leading a shot and land it on a moving target?

[2022-12-23 15:06:33] <El_manuelL> @kragiee if thats the arguement, go cassidy soldier any hitscan that you consider you can still see the bullet

[2022-12-23 15:07:19] <%zacku> LOL
[2022-12-23 15:07:26] <vale11111> maybe it is just an animation? the actual hitscan goes there insta?
[2022-12-23 15:07:33] <rookieh3re> @CoreroC bruh you trolling
[2022-12-23 15:07:34] <%zacku> iirc
[2022-12-23 15:07:40] <+3randonnnnn> my guess is that it is intentional
[2022-12-23 15:07:41] <%zacku> probably vods?
[2022-12-23 15:07:43] <almondsaredope> Can we have a poll? Im genuinely curious who still thinks ashe is hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:07:46] <+blancofett> @kragiee do it again but actually hit a training bot so you can slow down and show the actual hitreg
[2022-12-23 15:07:49] <%zacku> it was so long ago
[2022-12-23 15:07:51] <batcarpet121> does ashe leave a trail like widow shots do?
[2022-12-23 15:07:54] <Unicorn1s> @CoreroC I feel like you are the one trolling
[2022-12-23 15:08:12] <+3randonnnnn> would be a lot easier to hit headshots if it was truly hitscan
[2022-12-23 15:08:12] <El_manuelL> so you are saying that its not hitscan , its a projectile with the fastest speed that it appears to be hitscan?

[2022-12-23 16:10:44] <+zekutopgum> i've won 1v1's vs hog as lucio
[2022-12-23 16:10:44] <1diegow> just time his hooks
[2022-12-23 16:10:45] <Guilty_Tux> Or if you hit all your reaper headshots after he uses heal
[2022-12-23 16:10:48] <plords19> roadhog hooks across the map
[2022-12-23 16:10:48] <+OK9_> reaper?
[2022-12-23 16:10:48] <Zunair77> What bout Reaper vs Hog?
[2022-12-23 16:10:53] <+theclamdestroyer> until he hooks and 1 shots you cause you don't have kiriko
[2022-12-23 16:10:56] <+zekutopgum> reaper can def win vs hog
[2022-12-23 16:11:00] <CHICKEN2XD> @nasty__nate___ Nate you’re still nasty even in kragiee’s stream

[2022-12-23 16:11:12] <@%$nasty__nate___> @CHICKEN2XD have to stay in character
[2022-12-23 16:11:35] <+zekutopgum> @Lykud no it was just a tight space and I kept jumping above him and hit basically all headshots; lucio does a lot of damage if you hit your shots
[2022-12-23 16:11:36] <%+Estaphon> one hook and head shot from hog beats reaper EZ and reapers hit box is huge and gets hooked ez
[2022-12-23 16:11:53] <+OK9_> @Guilty_Tux yeah same, just need to dodge his hook
[2022-12-23 16:11:55] <danrfuns> lol orisa throw

[2022-12-23 16:11:58] <Guilty_Tux> Yeah use your ghost mode on hook, ez
[2022-12-23 16:12:00] <ahmetyanov> hog can oneshot him
[2022-12-23 16:12:00] <+SonhadoraArtemis> hook=shift

[2022-12-23 16:12:36] <hatem55765> tracer ?
[2022-12-23 16:12:42] <Guilty_Tux> his hook can be countered if perfect timing ghost mode when being pulled in by reaper
[2022-12-23 16:12:43] <+zekutopgum> if it's decently open and distance

[2022-12-23 16:12:54] <+Hard_Liquors> my stubbornness still feels like reaper could beat hog if you dodge the hook
[2022-12-23 16:12:54] <ahmetyanov> @zekutopgum if she stays faaaaaaaar away
[2022-12-23 16:12:56] <+OK9_> reinhart in hogs face wins though\'
[2022-12-23 16:13:00] <+MillerPC> Don't get hooked by hog challenge
[2022-12-23 16:13:06] <+MillerPC> impossible
[2022-12-23 16:13:09] <+zekutopgum> @ahmetyanov and she can with slide
[2022-12-23 16:13:12] <nebulous_au> doesnt orisa win 1v1 because spear stops heal?
[2022-12-23 16:13:19] <+menialgore_> phara out of hook range
[2022-12-23 16:13:28] <Smizzyy> Ana is helpful in the team to counter hog
[2022-12-23 16:13:42] <+MillerPC> ana is good and zen is good if you focus damage
[2022-12-23 16:13:53] <ahmetyanov> yes krag said u can win if you stay away
[2022-12-23 16:13:59] <+NechuEXE> @nebulous_au hog does more damage than orisa
[2022-12-23 16:14:16] <CHICKEN2XD> Sojourn ult is just bullshit. Ow

[2022-12-23 17:07:50] <@%$nasty__nate___> it can't go without mention that kragie also has world class mechanics
[2022-12-23 17:07:50] <SUPERMAXXED> do you use your keyboard to aim in 1v1 duels (if that makes sense)
[2022-12-23 17:08:07] <+midnitedream914> I am in diamond on console and I had to reverse my MMR to win games @kragiee

[2022-12-23 17:08:32] <batsybats117> what seperates players in GM ranks? i think mechanical skill would more or less be the same at those ranks, is it being unpredictable or something else?
[2022-12-23 17:08:34] <@%$nasty__nate___> all that time pillaging paid off

[2022-12-23 17:08:47] <+midnitedream914> @kragiee every game i had the worst tank and dps bc i was carrying most games so I woudl never get a good dps or tank so i had to start oding the least dmg on the team to start getting good teammates

[2022-12-23 19:08:39] <TeenyPeenypvt> their balancing is so questionable sometimes
[2022-12-23 19:08:42] <batsybats117> we need a 5.8 tracer
