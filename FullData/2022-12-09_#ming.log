[2022-12-09 15:42:18] <%Drexun> our central def is our weak point...both def and on the ball...when our centre backs get the ball i feel the opposition will force mistakes
[2022-12-09 15:42:18] <%DDXW> for some reason he wants Liverpool

[2022-12-09 15:42:25] <%Phoenixguide> Liverpool
[2022-12-09 15:42:26] <harry_70> If maguire doesn’t cost England a goal that means he is having a good game that’s the best you’ll get out of him
[2022-12-09 15:42:27] <%liam7100> Not real?
[2022-12-09 15:42:36] <%DDXW> he was supposed to come United but we fucked over his little brother or someshit

[2022-12-09 15:43:36] <%Drexun> thats because their mistakes are avoidable
[2022-12-09 15:43:50] <%RossoneriACE> he got a bad reputation that's why everyone ignores his good plays lol
[2022-12-09 15:43:57] <harry_70> He better deal with a ball into the box with his big head
