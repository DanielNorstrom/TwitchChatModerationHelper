[2022-12-16 06:49:11] <$BurnedAether> I think that said "Open Space" not river.
[2022-12-16 06:49:20] <%EpicPumaNess> new fort? what happened? just got bored of the other?
[2022-12-16 06:49:51] [Notification] BranLan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 92 months! [I see my button returned in time for the new fortress.]
[2022-12-16 06:49:59] <trashpandab3ar> Hey Richard and chat
[2022-12-16 06:50:03] <%EpicPumaNess> fair enough, you can employ everything you learned into this run too
[2022-12-16 06:50:03] <%Kardmager> Oh damn do dwarves hate salty misty water on their though?
[2022-12-16 06:50:37] <%+Dogvomit_> üëã
[2022-12-16 06:50:42] <%+Heroic_Platypus> oh damn, New fort, did something happen to the old one that I missed?
[2022-12-16 06:50:47] <%+DrakeCid> dark and darker playtest begins in five hours if you happen to stream that long today
[2022-12-16 06:50:52] <%DruggedYak> Yup. I'm definitely an 83 year old miner
[2022-12-16 06:50:58] <%DruggedYak> from NYC
[2022-12-16 06:50:59] <$BurnedAether> @Heroic_Platypus Lag.
[2022-12-16 06:51:07] <%+Heroic_Platypus> time to make a command
[2022-12-16 06:51:08] <ItsRender> you can try to make the max number of dwarfs 150 or 180 instead of 220max @richard_hammer
[2022-12-16 06:51:10] <%EpicPumaNess> make a command?
[2022-12-16 06:51:22] <42424242424242424242> time for a !new command (
[2022-12-16 06:51:25] <42424242424242424242> * )
[2022-12-16 06:51:33] <bdres> perpetual waterfall machine is the end game. he beat the last fort
[2022-12-16 06:51:38] <+RitualSauce> be sure to geld your animals too so lag doesn't get out of control
[2022-12-16 06:51:41] <ItsRender> but DF just gets laggy, its part of the game sadly.
[2022-12-16 06:51:45] <$ethaneus> Does Dorf run better on certain CPUs? I know it‚Äôs a single threaded game
[2022-12-16 06:51:49] <+RitualSauce> catsplosions are a huge meme
[2022-12-16 06:51:54] <+RitualSauce> for a reason
[2022-12-16 06:52:01] <ItsRender> its Simulating so much CPU's have a hard time keeping up
[2022-12-16 06:52:09] <+RitualSauce> well, if they're pets it makes the dorfs unhappy if you kill them

[2022-12-16 07:02:01] <$BurnedAether> I'm at the point of just living in my fort. I need to either start raiding people or dig deeper. We will see.
[2022-12-16 07:02:35] <%Heroic_Platypus> I feel like twitch has increased their profit margin on bits quite a bit. a new price is seems very high
[2022-12-16 07:02:40] <%Kardmager> Idk how creative I am
[2022-12-16 07:03:14] <trashpandab3ar> new fort, new potential for fun things to show up
[2022-12-16 07:03:19] <%Heroic_Platypus> also English is hard
[2022-12-16 07:03:25] <%Kardmager> Hopefully you not buying on mobile
[2022-12-16 07:04:04] <%Kardmager> Since apple/google take 30% if you buy not on pc

[2022-12-16 07:07:10] <@^Moobot> @thadeus_13 Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-16 07:07:16] <%EpicPumaNess> I stopped eating school lunch in highschool cause I would just go to  the cuilinary classroom and cook there
[2022-12-16 07:07:26] <%Heroic_Platypus> it's not stealing, it's reallocating
[2022-12-16 07:07:37] <%$eSaltcracker> depends if you get state welfare for children, thats the child's money just used by the guardian
[2022-12-16 07:07:51] <%EpicPumaNess> to be fair, my sophomore year, we got a brand new highschool in my town, to explain the classroom
[2022-12-16 07:07:55] <EngeltheFallen> if you get welfare then usually you got free lunch in school
[2022-12-16 07:08:34] <%Kardmager> Honestly all meals should be free for kids
[2022-12-16 07:08:35] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-16 07:08:42] <Ebonmourn> the time and hassle
[2022-12-16 07:08:44] <Prealia> @Richard_Hammer yep been there done that
[2022-12-16 07:09:08] <%$eSaltcracker> I had a guy he fell out with his parents and called in on the relevant department so he got all the childcare money (germany) so yeah its prob differently
[2022-12-16 07:10:08] <bdres> a lot of schools have been ending food programs. dunno why we cant just feed kids
[2022-12-16 07:10:08] <%EpicPumaNess> I'm against kids having to pay for lunch in school, only because they're basically forced to be there, but I'm not smart enough to argue the logistics
[2022-12-16 07:10:29] <%K9kroz> how far down did you start this one? @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-16 07:10:33] <%Kardmager> Starting an hour later and free breakfast shown to help kids learn/pay attention more
[2022-12-16 07:10:42] <EngeltheFallen> omg
[2022-12-16 07:10:55] <!%+krainboltgreene> i did it i got DF.
[2022-12-16 07:11:06] <!%+krainboltgreene> a decade long sober period gone
[2022-12-16 07:11:19] <%K9kroz> In Japan they get the kids to help make the food and clean the dishes after. 2 Meals a day and that "pays" for the food which also teaches kids lots of great lessons
[2022-12-16 07:11:38] <!%+krainboltgreene> Pro-tip: stay out of swamps, the ambience is bugged and it sounds like someone is constantly cumming in your ear.
[2022-12-16 07:12:14] <%K9kroz> Is Dick muted?
[2022-12-16 07:12:32] <Maki_Rollz> no
[2022-12-16 07:12:39] <trashpandab3ar> @k9kroz no, I can hear him fine
[2022-12-16 07:12:51] <!%+krainboltgreene> I can hear him.

[2022-12-16 07:13:47] <trashpandab3ar> damn, those birds are vicious
[2022-12-16 07:15:12] <%K9kroz> I couldnt hear the stream earlier. Anyone know how deep he started the fort this time
[2022-12-16 07:15:25] <!%+krainboltgreene> 14 elevation
[2022-12-16 07:15:35] <!%+krainboltgreene> It's in the top right
[2022-12-16 07:16:08] <+Cynder_Dragon> Pog, new fort time?
[2022-12-16 07:16:28] <Ebonmourn> all the giant birds
[2022-12-16 07:16:49] <+Cynder_Dragon> I'm sad I didn't watch the last because I'm playing as well and didn't want to see what late game DF looked like with 100+ dwarves
[2022-12-16 07:17:11] <%Kardmager> Gandolf pissed and sending giant birds in
[2022-12-16 07:17:29] <+Cynder_Dragon> But I can only assume Richard is basically a grand master at Dwarf Fortressing now right? Kappa

[2022-12-16 07:20:29] <GOOBERS515> Yeah learning this game is a monster. We're currently trying to turn everyone in the fort into vampires so I feel ya
[2022-12-16 07:20:40] <WishingOnAWendy> bro I'm losing my mind... I set everyone to a burrow, disabled getting things from outside the borrow, and half my dwarfs just ran outside and died trying to harvest plants outside the burrow
[2022-12-16 07:20:42] <$CockyRooster> evening everyone, glad to see a fresh run
[2022-12-16 07:20:45] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I havn't even noticed temperate as a mechanic

[2022-12-16 07:21:42] <EngeltheFallen> the ageless holes returned
[2022-12-16 07:21:50] <GOOBERS515> btw since you're starting a new fort, you might wanna try a volcano. Sounds awful but is actually easier
[2022-12-16 07:22:07] <GOOBERS515> totally fair
[2022-12-16 07:22:34] <@%BranLan> We did lose a run in under an hour
[2022-12-16 07:22:44] <GOOBERS515> haha loosing is fun so I getcha
[2022-12-16 07:23:03] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I tried starting in a Sinister area, and I died 2 minutes in as some horrid beasts slaughters my colony LUL

[2022-12-16 07:25:11] [Notification] SkyLineAce subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! [Excited for new fort]
[2022-12-16 07:25:20] <+skyorrichegg> what caused the last fort's downfall? I have been busy the last few weeks sadly and just showed up
[2022-12-16 07:25:27] <%Kardmager> Dicks last colony is still alive he wanted to do a new colony to build it better on what he learned and deal with less lag
[2022-12-16 07:25:56] <+skyorrichegg> makes sense, the true DF killer... lag
[2022-12-16 07:26:20] <%Prealia> @Richard_Hammer thanks vowels and consonants
[2022-12-16 07:26:43] <Robocurious> was the lag from population?
[2022-12-16 07:27:44] <bdres> dumping can reduce lag?
[2022-12-16 07:27:53] <Ebonmourn> dumping in magma does at least
[2022-12-16 07:28:16] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I was distracted. What game speed do you play at?
[2022-12-16 07:28:49] <equinsuocha__> you know you can start the stairs at the z level you want an scroll all the way down and click and it will build all of them
[2022-12-16 07:28:57] <%SkyLineAce> !please
[2022-12-16 07:28:57] <@^Moobot> @SkyLineAce Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-16 07:29:01] <%+Cynder_Dragon> By default it's 100, I just ask because I personally turn it down since it seems fast.

[2022-12-16 07:29:33] <%+skyorrichegg> I always thought the inconvenience was half of the appeal in DF...
[2022-12-16 07:29:59] <dingo2345> if I shut my front door, I have to talk out of my other hole
[2022-12-16 07:31:11] <IrateInitiate> any agitated giant ravens in chat?
[2022-12-16 07:31:43] <ZeroDjinn> thats so raven? Or whatever that show was called
[2022-12-16 07:32:04] <+madugami> SMOrc
[2022-12-16 07:32:18] <Jebediah_xD> uh oh what happened?
[2022-12-16 07:33:23] <%+Usinji> Did you change any of the difficulty settings this go around? Or same as last run?
[2022-12-16 07:33:43] <+SpaceGhost8> tall one
[2022-12-16 07:33:48] <%+Cynder_Dragon> pacman cave
[2022-12-16 07:33:49] <trashpandab3ar> damn, this thing is huge
[2022-12-16 07:33:52] <%+Rodum> i have a gross cave like that in my game
[2022-12-16 07:33:53] <ZeroDjinn> is that all water?
[2022-12-16 07:33:59] <+Seriack> Procedural generation. NODDERS
[2022-12-16 07:34:02] <%+Rodum> there was zero water in mine too
[2022-12-16 07:34:09] <!%+krainboltgreene> It's just open air?!
[2022-12-16 07:34:12] <!%+krainboltgreene> That's horrible.
[2022-12-16 07:34:18] <%+Cynder_Dragon> That's a CHASM
[2022-12-16 07:34:28] <!%+krainboltgreene> That dwarf must be terrified.
[2022-12-16 07:34:32] <bdres> pretty luck to get a straight shaft like that
[2022-12-16 07:34:42] <$BurnedAether> At some point I just want to turn an entire cavern into a fort. In due time.
[2022-12-16 07:34:56] <+SpaceGhost8> cave fort is on my list too
[2022-12-16 07:35:18] <trashpandab3ar> could you imagine digging and siddenly seeing a 40 story drop appear beneath you?
[2022-12-16 07:35:28] <$CATDesign> My goal is to see if I can take a nearly dead civilization, and increase their population.
[2022-12-16 07:35:32] <IrateInitiate> not beneath, it's just off to the right Kappa
[2022-12-16 07:36:15] <+Seriack> Waiting for a dwarf to drunkenly walk down those stairs and careen right off the edge.
[2022-12-16 07:36:17] <Iqunlimited> üëÄ new fort
[2022-12-16 07:36:46] <+Seriack> Welp, that stops what I was waiting for... for now.
[2022-12-16 07:37:08] <Robocurious> tall underground caves with buildings built/carved into the sides is a sick fantasy setting
[2022-12-16 07:37:41] <Ghulmeister> is this an old mineshaft from a previous draw civ?
[2022-12-16 07:37:49] <Ghulmeister> dwarf*
[2022-12-16 07:38:12] <phillymilksteak> Did you concede to FPS death or did something catastrophic happen? I know you were itching to put your knowledge towards a new fort
[2022-12-16 07:38:24] <ActsofInfamy> Do you have to put floors before you put walls when there's open air like that?
[2022-12-16 07:38:26] <ActsofInfamy> Or can walls float?
[2022-12-16 07:38:34] <ActsofInfamy> Recently bought the game, but haven't been able to play much
[2022-12-16 07:38:55] <Ghulmeister> only floors can float ^^
[2022-12-16 07:39:00] <ActsofInfamy> LuL
[2022-12-16 07:39:01] <Iqunlimited> some battle going down
[2022-12-16 07:39:19] <%+skyorrichegg> yeah I thought I was hallucinating that raven in the staircase

[2022-12-16 07:41:15] <tsiken> angwy waven biwd
[2022-12-16 07:41:22] <Maki_Rollz> it was laggy
[2022-12-16 07:43:02] <%DerekTheDeliman> lag is really bad when you start getting larger colonies, hopefully they can optimize it a bit
[2022-12-16 07:43:50] <EngeltheFallen> dick wanted to know if the holes are really ageless
[2022-12-16 07:44:12] <LorentzForces> @DerekTheDeliman historically this has gotten a bit better over every update, so likely to a degree
[2022-12-16 07:45:01] <%DerekTheDeliman> thats good to hear

[2022-12-16 07:56:59] <%Lakart> Your last colony lacked some kind of dangerous monster locked in a closet to release for population lowering times
[2022-12-16 07:57:05] <+RaffleSnaffle> why do you think it was crashing? lots of moving water?
[2022-12-16 07:57:43] <%Lakart> Diggin deep af right away eh?

[2022-12-16 08:02:35] <AmoremDei> Ah. Dig around. I didn't find my magma sea until I dug round the bottom few layers.

[2022-12-16 08:11:32] <%Lakart> A mighty wooden hatch to hold back the lava richKrappa
[2022-12-16 08:11:48] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Oh wow you dig super deep at the start, that's cool
[2022-12-16 08:12:07] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'm like 3 years in and haven't gone below -1
[2022-12-16 08:12:14] <TigerclawCZ> guys why do they say this game is more complex than rimworld?
[2022-12-16 08:12:24] <EngeltheFallen> because it is
[2022-12-16 08:12:29] <EngeltheFallen> been getting updates for 20 years
[2022-12-16 08:12:42] <Ghulmeister> this is the grandpa of rimworld
[2022-12-16 08:12:47] <Kumikurre> yep
[2022-12-16 08:12:51] <Iqunlimited> they are quite different games
[2022-12-16 08:12:54] <EngeltheFallen> for 1 unlike rimworld, you can dig down in this one
[2022-12-16 08:12:57] <Lazyman32> have you been enjoying dwarf fortress so far?
[2022-12-16 08:13:08] <+arnoldpalmerlemonade> we talking about the difference between fucking and fighting again?
[2022-12-16 08:13:14] <Lazyman32> fair
[2022-12-16 08:13:28] <EngeltheFallen> both are emergent story games in the end
[2022-12-16 08:13:47] <+TeeLeBee> did you play df before the steam release?
[2022-12-16 08:13:56] <OldButtSoup> the only feature I miss from rimworld is being able to directly control military units in combat
[2022-12-16 08:14:16] [Notification] Krotax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2022-12-16 08:14:21] <TigerclawCZ> and tell them to haul immediately :)
[2022-12-16 08:14:21] <+arnoldpalmerlemonade> yeah I wish they had a rimworld that was more starcraft control style of units
[2022-12-16 08:14:31] <Siegerolf> the ascii was just too much, i could never get into it
[2022-12-16 08:14:46] <Lazyman32> thats a deep cavern
[2022-12-16 08:14:49] <EngeltheFallen> yeah ascii df was just hard really to wrap your head around
[2022-12-16 08:14:52] <OldButtSoup> everything else I prefer DF for though
[2022-12-16 08:15:06] <Ghulmeister> you actually get used to the ascii after a while, i played it like that quite a lot
[2022-12-16 08:15:08] <Kumikurre> I played the ascii for years
[2022-12-16 08:15:15] <EngeltheFallen> looks like these guys made quite a bit of cash from this release too
[2022-12-16 08:15:16] <Iqunlimited> yeah i never used tilesets in DF
[2022-12-16 08:15:19] <Iqunlimited> ascii until this version
[2022-12-16 08:15:33] <OldButtSoup> I played the ascii version because I was too newb to know about the graphics options LUL
[2022-12-16 08:15:48] <+TeeLeBee> the learning cliff isn't as bad either in Rimworld I think
[2022-12-16 08:16:04] <Siegerolf> Tynan did a great job with Rimworld
[2022-12-16 08:16:08] <Lazyman32> gonna be interesting to see how dwarf fortress develops over the next few years
[2022-12-16 08:16:18] <EngeltheFallen> likely people who like this also like rimworld in the end
[2022-12-16 08:16:34] <Iqunlimited> blood everywhere
[2022-12-16 08:16:40] <%+Cynder_Dragon> In my case, I tried rimworld but got confused as to what to do, but this game hooked me, so I'll probably give Rimworld another good shot
[2022-12-16 08:16:49] <Lazyman32> the magic update that will be coming out in like 3 years is gonna be nuts
[2022-12-16 08:16:59] <OldButtSoup> yes I like both games too, they scratch different itches for me
[2022-12-16 08:17:08] <Siegerolf> its great to see the dwarf fortress team get some sales revenue
[2022-12-16 08:17:36] <%BGa9> i mean rimworld has an objective to it if you get confused just work toward it
[2022-12-16 08:17:45] <%BGa9> dwarf fortress is pure sandbox
[2022-12-16 08:18:03] <robertonawhim> this version helped me learn classic dwarf fortress its all transferable.  I'm super impressed with this game
[2022-12-16 08:18:09] <Ghulmeister> i felt like a pianist, using all those hotkeys back in the day ^^
[2022-12-16 08:18:32] <%TheOriginalFelord> chinese cultivation knockoff rimworld still best game
[2022-12-16 08:18:33] <robertonawhim> I'm seeing things in this game that I haven't seen in 10 years of playing
[2022-12-16 08:18:40] <phillymilksteak> oh yeah, when you got good at the hot keys, it felt nice
[2022-12-16 08:19:09] <MrFRZ> D:
[2022-12-16 08:19:14] <MrFRZ> Two dwarves died
[2022-12-16 08:19:19] <%+Cynder_Dragon> f
[2022-12-16 08:19:26] <Iqunlimited> sheesh
[2022-12-16 08:19:38] <phillymilksteak> To a gorlak or what?
[2022-12-16 08:19:51] <Kumikurre> where did those dwarves die :o
[2022-12-16 08:20:35] <Kumikurre> ah, damn cavern-dwellers getting into your fort :c

[2022-12-16 08:21:59] <%Lakart> @TheOriginalFelord agreed
[2022-12-16 08:22:18] <%Lakart> Roc in DF is 1 tile, giant monsters in cultivation sim cover whole screen
[2022-12-16 08:23:24] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'm amazed at the funny stuff that can happen in this game
[2022-12-16 08:24:04] <%SkyLineAce> wait how did 2 die
[2022-12-16 08:24:09] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I was scared of the first giant that attacked me, but was defeated by a hen, that the giant dodged into a lake and drowned
[2022-12-16 08:24:16] <%SkyLineAce> oof
[2022-12-16 08:24:45] <%Prealia> Cynder_Dragon lol

[2022-12-16 08:28:45] <ned_arb> had a 2 year old go into a strange mood and become a legendary bone carver awhile ago
[2022-12-16 08:28:49] <Kumikurre> children are decent haulers tho :D Child labour is cool
[2022-12-16 08:28:57] <Aeiren> child labour IS cool
[2022-12-16 08:29:06] <Aeiren> rimworld agrees, too
[2022-12-16 08:29:07] <$BurnedAether> @ned_arb Same! They made a bone bed worth a ton.
[2022-12-16 08:29:18] <Ghulmeister> in a colony, everyone has to help
[2022-12-16 08:29:18] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'm up to 65 people but not A SINGLE child, and I have multiple lovers/spouses who arnt having kids
[2022-12-16 08:29:42] <%+Cynder_Dragon> It's an old folks home
[2022-12-16 08:29:47] <blockington99> @Cynder_Dragon they're simply all infertile
[2022-12-16 08:30:43] <IrateInitiate> @Cynder_Dragon dwarf old or vampire old? Important distinctions.
[2022-12-16 08:30:49] <+sillydragon2003> is the blue, water? did it cave in?
[2022-12-16 08:31:01] <IrateInitiate> @sillydragon2003 the blue is air LUL
[2022-12-16 08:31:09] <%+Cynder_Dragon> @irateinitiate There's vampires in DF?

[2022-12-16 08:31:26] <Kumikurre> Must be rather stressful for your dwarves to bump into random trogdolytes when casually going up and down the deep stairs. Even worse when it happens in the unwalled sections
[2022-12-16 08:31:37] <AmoremDei> fk yeah my blacksmith just got possessed
[2022-12-16 08:33:58] <%+Cynder_Dragon> richFine
[2022-12-16 08:34:48] <Kumikurre> what a lovely place for a hospital: a warehouse full of miasma LUL
[2022-12-16 08:34:56] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'm not even gonna get a slab for that LUL
[2022-12-16 08:36:42] <+Shaggyscoots> I've had two awesome embarks that got screwed by waves of giant birds..  Really grinds my gears
[2022-12-16 08:36:51] <%+madvoid> hey dick, do you think i should look up a tutorial on youtube on how to play this game? i work a lot during the holidays and dont have a ton of time to learn new games. but coming from rimworld, this game looks amazing and packed with months if not years worth of fun
[2022-12-16 08:36:55] <%+Cynder_Dragon> How have you been faring through the work detail system? It's definitely been the most time and frustration to deal with
[2022-12-16 08:37:04] <+Shaggyscoots> Losing is fun
[2022-12-16 08:37:48] <+Shaggyscoots> @madvoid take the time to learn it, it's an amazing game.  SO unique.  I took the plunge back in ASCII and got addicted
[2022-12-16 08:38:23] <%SkyLineAce> richFine
[2022-12-16 08:38:46] <+Shaggyscoots> It's not that hard to learn now at all.
[2022-12-16 08:39:04] <+Shaggyscoots> still has a decent learning curve though
[2022-12-16 08:39:18] <%+Cynder_Dragon> There's A LOT of nuance to learn though
[2022-12-16 08:39:22] <+Shaggyscoots> ^
[2022-12-16 08:39:35] <$alpha_5h311> the only reason i wouldn't recommend it to people was the ascii interface, and now that the interface is only clunky instead of impentrable it's definitely the time to start
[2022-12-16 08:39:47] <+Shaggyscoots> Once they iron the steam version out a bit, this will be the best game ever made imo
[2022-12-16 08:40:03] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Like, every zone is built a little differently
[2022-12-16 08:40:07] <+Shaggyscoots> @alpha_5h311 agreed
[2022-12-16 08:40:30] <!%Calastigro> oh yeah, i finally got the equipment to make coffee at home; i can order some madrinas beans richHoggers
[2022-12-16 08:40:33] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I didn't realize bedrooms n other rooms should encompass the walls in the zone
[2022-12-16 08:40:54] <+Shaggyscoots> The ascii version was soo much better though.  Just learning it was... a journey.  I'm glad I took that journey though
[2022-12-16 08:41:05] <!Ellieanna> the snow is here, about 4cm so far, could potentially get up to 40cm
[2022-12-16 08:41:50] <$alpha_5h311> well from what i understand you'll be able to switch the graphics off if you want eventually
[2022-12-16 08:41:50] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-16 08:41:55] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'll definitely try Classic when it comes out, but definitely can't prefer that
[2022-12-16 08:41:59] <!Ellieanna> oh twitch, please allow us to use our prime subs on mobile ffs
[2022-12-16 08:42:11] <%+MrZev> so did the city die or did you get tired of the FPS
[2022-12-16 08:42:14] <!%Calastigro> imagine trying to explain original dwarf fortress to your grandkids
[2022-12-16 08:42:17] <!%Calastigro> you'd sound insane
[2022-12-16 08:42:37] <+Shaggyscoots> Show them some screen shots and melt their brain
[2022-12-16 08:42:58] <yukipoper> new fort new year new me
[2022-12-16 08:43:24] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I'm 2 episodes into a story about "murderedboat" it's slow right now but I heard it's good
[2022-12-16 08:43:45] <!%Calastigro> @Cynder_Dragon i thought it was boatmurdered, but yes
[2022-12-16 08:43:47] <!%Calastigro> it's real good
[2022-12-16 08:44:03] <bdres> maybe fuck around with burrows
[2022-12-16 08:44:22] <AmoremDei> "I've come to terms with your death" would be a savage insult irl.
[2022-12-16 08:45:06] <%EpicPumaNess> "Fuck them Kids"
[2022-12-16 08:45:07] <RizTheWizard> think of the children D:
[2022-12-16 08:45:33] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Rimworld: oh sweet precious thing. DF: god damn useless kids stay out there as bait
[2022-12-16 08:45:33] <CK_Zweistein> they were warned that the outside world is dangerus
[2022-12-16 08:46:26] <RizTheWizard> I blame violent media
[2022-12-16 08:46:44] <Aeiren> The children are the problem
[2022-12-16 08:46:45] <IrateInitiate> endgame baby training cages in DF are much worse than "the outdoors"
[2022-12-16 08:47:24] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Can I give a hot take? I don't like the dwarf sprites in this game. I could be conditioned by other media, but I wish they were more "stylized"
[2022-12-16 08:47:44] <IrateInitiate> easy fix, play in ASCII Kappa

[2022-12-16 08:51:19] <bdres> 0 for 2 on the bedroom layout
[2022-12-16 08:51:27] <IrateInitiate> that's a lot of cavern
[2022-12-16 08:51:33] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Look at that, a living space already designed for you
[2022-12-16 08:52:01] <IrateInitiate> found a water source, at least?

[2022-12-16 08:53:53] <+MrPayToWin> Why are you snaking out all this mining so early on? I'm new to the game, trying to learn
[2022-12-16 08:54:18] <+MrPayToWin> ahhh
[2022-12-16 08:54:28] <+MrPayToWin> I thought i was missing something
[2022-12-16 08:54:49] <%+Cynder_Dragon> The best dwarves dig the deepest holes
[2022-12-16 08:54:55] <Aeiren> this looks like troglodyte central
[2022-12-16 08:55:07] <BongTokingPeon> is there something bad on the surface? I just got out of a meeting and have had the stream muted
[2022-12-16 08:55:23] <IrateInitiate> the sun DansGame
[2022-12-16 08:55:25] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Sunlight, sunlight is bad
[2022-12-16 08:55:38] <bdres> theres a yak being chewed to death by a squirrel. its a very loud affair and its better to just be underground

[2022-12-16 08:56:13] <%+Th3_Captain> this year
[2022-12-16 08:56:49] <%+Cynder_Dragon> That's a lot of fishing and baby making
[2022-12-16 08:57:50] <+madugami> drinking amount is low
[2022-12-16 08:59:11] <+dajocon> New fort?
[2022-12-16 09:00:20] <Treize_K> How do I deal with angry birds attacking my dwarfs while they are fishing?
[2022-12-16 09:00:44] <$alpha_5h311> tell them the pigs are at the next fortress
[2022-12-16 09:00:53] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Hire a bunch of pigs and build a fort
[2022-12-16 09:01:06] <BongTokingPeon> is underground fishing a thing?
[2022-12-16 09:01:11] <bdres> @Treize_K maybe you can try building a fishing house or something
[2022-12-16 09:01:15] <CK_Zweistein> just go underground ^^
[2022-12-16 09:01:35] <%+Cynder_Dragon> @bongtokingpeon yes but still plenty dangerous
[2022-12-16 09:01:40] <+cody_han> monkaS
[2022-12-16 09:02:30] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Dwarf fishing is just like minecraft fishing. where theres water, theres fish

[2022-12-16 09:03:07] <+dajocon> It is not
[2022-12-16 09:03:23] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Well sone tiles may have none but I've made my own ponds
[2022-12-16 09:03:25] <Aeiren> How do you tell if there IS fish?
[2022-12-16 09:03:39] <+madugami> whos blood is that?
[2022-12-16 09:03:46] <Aeiren> oh, okay, LUL
[2022-12-16 09:03:47] <+dajocon> It was more obvious in classic..
[2022-12-16 09:04:01] <%+Cynder_Dragon> There will be alerts saying "no fish found in bla bla bla"
[2022-12-16 09:04:05] <+dajocon> There was an announcement when there were no fish in an area
[2022-12-16 09:04:11] <Kiyuri> What's the purple stuff on the floor?
[2022-12-16 09:04:23] <TechPriestM4R5> i had a bunch of monster slayers just afk whilst a troll rampaged through my base, any idea why?
[2022-12-16 09:04:27] <+madugami> what are aquafers?
[2022-12-16 09:04:32] <Kiyuri> Fun fun
[2022-12-16 09:04:45] <$alpha_5h311> my understanding is you only get river fish in river tiles, and other water gets you a different list of potential catches
[2022-12-16 09:04:49] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Those were spectators LUL
[2022-12-16 09:05:08] <RobotOfSilver> @madugami They spawn water endlessly

[2022-12-16 09:07:11] <%Convectt> what happend to the last fort? Death by something or the lag?

[2022-12-16 09:07:38] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Why do you get so many kids, I've never gotten more than like, 2 kids on several hour expeditions
[2022-12-16 09:07:53] <%Kardmager> Last save is still good, dick just wants fresh colony to apply what he learned and deal with less lag
[2022-12-16 09:08:39] <%Convectt> gotcha
[2022-12-16 09:08:51] <%Convectt> a fair choice tbh

[2022-12-16 09:12:12] <%Convectt> I was gonna say in their cups
[2022-12-16 09:12:20] <%Convectt> but stone tablets work too

[2022-12-16 09:17:44] <@%MiniKatalyst> is this rimworld music, or is it just giving those vibes?
[2022-12-16 09:18:00] <@%MiniKatalyst> fair
[2022-12-16 09:18:46] <Gobbe__> What a dumbass
[2022-12-16 09:18:51] <Gobbe__> Being outside and shit
[2022-12-16 09:18:56] <%SkyLineAce> found out
[2022-12-16 09:19:26] <%SkyLineAce> everyone knows dwarves live inside of mountains, not outside of them. Dumb kid.
[2022-12-16 09:19:43] <@%MiniKatalyst> wait is this a new map from yesterday?
[2022-12-16 09:20:37] <%Kardmager> New map made today
[2022-12-16 09:20:51] <@%MiniKatalyst> ive been either catching the end of your stream or falling asleep to your vods this week

[2022-12-16 09:24:38] <%EpicPumaNess> no no richard, a murder is a GROUP of Ravens, not a big Raven Kappa
[2022-12-16 09:24:41] <%Convectt> Ravens are really smart maybe it could figure out how to open that door Kappa
[2022-12-16 09:24:57] <Ghulmeister> you dont need a croc moat when you got ravens in the sky
[2022-12-16 09:26:36] <YamiCorvus> a group of crows is a murder, a group of ravens is a conspiracy :P

[2022-12-16 10:02:11] <Mr_Quackums> had a coworker 3 or 4 years ago who would always play with a tech deck.  thing was so annoying
[2022-12-16 10:02:19] <%EpicPumaNess> Anybody remember the... I don't remember what they're called, but the bean things?
[2022-12-16 10:02:20] <+rasnerr> a raven in the base?! that means you are cursed @Richard_Hammer

[2022-12-16 10:03:33] <+Peiw> i had a metal power ranger slammer. i wonder where it is
[2022-12-16 10:04:07] <%EpicPumaNess> I was poor, so by the time I got the fad item, they were out of style
[2022-12-16 10:04:09] <%SkyLineAce> yeah I had a dumb amount of pogs
[2022-12-16 10:04:17] <%SkyLineAce> and they were all so cool looking
[2022-12-16 10:04:30] <+Peiw> were? still  i think
[2022-12-16 10:04:48] <+Peiw> i did not
[2022-12-16 10:05:05] <%EpicPumaNess> the only fad that actually stuck with me growing up, is collecting cards, specifically yugioh cards, but I collect pokemon and magic in small quantities as well
[2022-12-16 10:05:09] <+Peiw> yeah i dont archery  or i could keep trying
[2022-12-16 10:05:25] <%SkyLineAce> I bought my first magic cards like two weeks ago.

[2022-12-16 10:05:32] <ToasterWings> it's impossible my phone was in my place without me putting it under that layer of paper
[2022-12-16 10:06:01] <+Peiw> time and money, considering muzzle loader though

[2022-12-16 10:06:08] <CK_Zweistein> youre dwarfs hate u ^^
[2022-12-16 10:06:17] <%Convectt> I've been thinking about getting into archery as a side hobby
[2022-12-16 10:06:22] <%Convectt> but not for hunting tho
[2022-12-16 10:06:26] <+Peiw> not here unless you are disabled
[2022-12-16 10:06:28] <+Seriack> Well, he did dig into lava and is still being hounded by ravens...
[2022-12-16 10:06:35] <ToasterWings> just gonna listen to 90s pop
[2022-12-16 10:06:51] <+Peiw> i think you can but it has to be during the "modern" firearm season
[2022-12-16 10:07:26] <%+scottish1900> Modern Crossbows are insane yeah
[2022-12-16 10:07:52] <+Peiw> muzzle loader here ia couple weeks earlier than modern so thats why it is tempting to get out before most people hunt the shit out of it
[2022-12-16 10:07:55] <ToasterWings> the way to be safe is to make impressions on people in life, silly ain't it
[2022-12-16 10:07:56] <Kamyu2> elk.. bird?

[2022-12-16 10:08:59] <%+scottish1900> Also when you say muzzle loader you don't mean musket right? LUL
[2022-12-16 10:09:07] <+Peiw> modern yes
[2022-12-16 10:09:17] <%+scottish1900> A part of me knows that muzzle loading means effectively a musket but my brain says there is just no way
[2022-12-16 10:09:20] <+Peiw> yeah i was tellign my wife about it today lol
[2022-12-16 10:09:52] <Mr_Quackums> im not up to date on my Dick Hammer extended universe lore.  is Toaster Wings a bot?

[2022-12-16 10:10:48] <+Peiw> depends when you get them and where you shoot them
[2022-12-16 10:11:00] <%+scottish1900> It has a certain smell to it but it doesn't smell bad

[2022-12-16 10:12:30] <%Convectt> prion is from eating human brains right

[2022-12-16 10:12:42] <%+scottish1900> Not really, it can come from many things
[2022-12-16 10:12:44] <%Convectt> or is there a deer version
[2022-12-16 10:12:58] <%+scottish1900> There is a version for most mammals that we know of

[2022-12-16 12:01:47] <$geek2games> Migrants are related to your starting dwarf civ you pick at the start - if your civ is low population you don't get many migrants. You can also attract more people if you trade more, since the mountain home will think you have great riches.

[2022-12-16 12:14:19] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> anyway, fuck you. the rate my poo was so good it was worth doing for free
[2022-12-16 12:14:26] <%AnxietyPrime> maybe it'll thaw in summer?
[2022-12-16 12:14:47] <%AnxietyPrime> oof
[2022-12-16 12:15:01] <+Patros__> arctic biome?
[2022-12-16 12:15:10] <MrSpy60> time to mine ice and make a fort out of the blocks rooCry
[2022-12-16 12:15:48] <+Patros__> maybe magma can solve the issue
[2022-12-16 12:16:33] <%AnxietyPrime> yeah, an incredibly complicated, unnecessary and convoluted magma pump system just to thaw out the river sounds very dwarfish tbh
[2022-12-16 12:16:36] <+Patros__> or dig down into the caves for some water
[2022-12-16 12:16:39] <%+blazeit69YOLOswag> yea, I did FeelsGoodMan

[2022-12-16 12:19:57] <Skulltag> poor miner stuck in ice
[2022-12-16 12:20:29] <+PirateBadgers> so i've only been observing df so far, can frozen rivers and such be thawed? i've not seen anyone try cirISee
[2022-12-16 12:21:04] <MrSpy60> @PirateBadgers if it the area get hot enough yeah
[2022-12-16 12:21:17] <Skulltag> I mean it is mid-winter
[2022-12-16 12:21:22] <+PirateBadgers> ahh cir3 so just takes a lot of effort i guess cirLaugh
[2022-12-16 12:21:28] <Skulltag> ohh really? xD
[2022-12-16 12:21:44] <Skulltag> I've never had a river being frozen year round
[2022-12-16 12:21:58] <%AnxietyPrime> I wonder if the temperature stuff is thought out enough that you could run like a magma pipe next to it and thaw it
[2022-12-16 12:22:31] <%AnxietyPrime> oh
[2022-12-16 12:22:59] <%AnxietyPrime> option 2: make sick ice sculptures
[2022-12-16 12:23:28] <Pompolonius> You did something to temperature in the name of fps in your last fort, right? Is that still in effect?
[2022-12-16 12:24:50] <r3nko_> Enabled temperature -> Barrel IMMEDIATELY bursts into flames
[2022-12-16 12:24:59] <RoboTiio> yea I saw a flame too
[2022-12-16 12:25:05] <RoboTiio> your whiskeys on fire
[2022-12-16 12:25:43] <RoboTiio> I thought there was fire on the barrels lol but maybe I imagined it
[2022-12-16 12:25:54] <%dream_unskilled> not the whiskey, everything but the whiskey NotLikeThis
[2022-12-16 12:25:56] <Heavy509> magma in wooden barrel? Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:25:57] <%AnxietyPrime> there was smoke down there for a second
[2022-12-16 12:25:58] <r3nko_> There was, it is fine now
[2022-12-16 12:26:01] <MrSpy60> looked like there was a smoke cloud
[2022-12-16 12:26:08] <+Patros__> apparently ice in vicinity to magma does indeed melt
[2022-12-16 12:26:10] <RoboTiio> guess it was a graphical bug if everyone isnt dead
[2022-12-16 12:28:15] <%dream_unskilled> did your game just close without any errors on the last save? Cuz I have this too sometimes and don't know why
[2022-12-16 12:28:59] <%dream_unskilled> mhh weird, I had a pop of about 120ish when it randomly decided to do it here and then, raged and made a new save
