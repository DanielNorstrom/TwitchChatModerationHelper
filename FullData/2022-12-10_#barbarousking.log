[2022-12-10 01:00:06] <%Ganongoat> In America medical care is privatized, so it being a business, you are more than capable of bargaining for better wages and benefits.
[2022-12-10 01:00:07] <%MattiaV96> my mother is a nurse, the only way she "escaped" having to work with covid is because she works at the first hospital in Italy where covid broke out and she was one of the first infected.

[2022-12-10 01:00:24] <$insomnijanek> As a student nurse and being in the care sector for 13 years, saying we don’t have a right to protest unfair pay just emphasises why we need to strike

[2022-12-10 03:06:51] <d_jolt> There's legit 80% chance that a blue shell happens in a race
[2022-12-10 03:06:54] <%Xiorx> @EngageKira Yes. Although it didn't fly until Double Dash
[2022-12-10 03:06:54] <ShowtimeTylers> I didnt think the blue shell was bad in mario kart 64, for example

[2022-12-10 03:07:11] <%+aldo_joel> in MKDD you can reaaally get far ahead
[2022-12-10 03:07:15] <$Poledra_Val> pretty sure Blue shell was introduced in mk 64

[2022-12-10 03:34:27] <%CarbonAxiom> @JustMoreZowee I've played most of the Armored Core games. IMO they each have their own problems which prevent them from being masterpieces. They do fix movement in the later games

[2022-12-10 17:38:58] <mmmmsugar> @vesipera my point was that a lot of the times, sadness or melancholy is the baseline and the good times feel fleeting while the sad times feel ever present (ie. I beat the villain! Oh but I lost my entire family)

[2022-12-10 19:30:57] <%volatile> they can't attach you unless you declare yourself a kingdom
[2022-12-10 19:31:00] <dardesh> i'm sure you will have a 500 men garrison soon
[2022-12-10 19:31:01] <%volatile> attack*
[2022-12-10 19:31:04] <%KashenCzechs> can you raise an army to defend if someone does attack?
[2022-12-10 19:31:10] <shamusyea> Fantastic hair
[2022-12-10 19:31:17] <%SinfulC> This series of games is really bad about that: As soon as they see that there is a city/town with less than 150 garrison, they just beeline for it.

[2022-12-10 19:31:46] <%+FacetiousShogun> It's going to be like realm divide.
[2022-12-10 19:31:52] <%$GreenFerret95> maybe something local?
[2022-12-10 19:32:11] <%volatile> should recruit locally so it doesn't have to run across the world, and give them enough men not to get ganked
[2022-12-10 19:32:14] <%+bradtjonas_comics> it was the MOOPS Costanza
[2022-12-10 19:32:16] <shamusyea> You need to make a recruiter party I think
[2022-12-10 19:32:18] <%gcobes> you do have towns
[2022-12-10 19:32:19] <%$GreenFerret95> @FacetiousShogun if a recruiter could recruit recruits
[2022-12-10 19:32:21] <%KashenCzechs> did that work? looked like you needed to build him a party?
[2022-12-10 19:32:24] <%LenBlowz> you did create the recruiter party

[2022-12-10 19:33:37] <%volatile> the recruiter will run around the map to recruit units you want to give them enough so looters don't gank them
[2022-12-10 19:33:39] <Shiverwarp> That sounds cool
[2022-12-10 19:33:42] <%gcobes> looks like it
[2022-12-10 19:33:43] <%Kroznok2> It's not a party without havarti Kappa
[2022-12-10 19:33:52] <Myrwynn> Yeah but that removes people from your garrison
[2022-12-10 19:34:00] <%+MarMar0326> @serenadeforte That’s a touchy subject. He did do a bingo. The final square came down to a judgement call. And Barb made the wrong call and lost all of us bread. But im not bitter about it.

[2022-12-10 20:10:28] <EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> The worst thing is that building fairgrounds is the only real way to improve loyalty, but you can't build it due to low loyalty. Good times
[2022-12-10 20:10:29] <dardesh> does you being in the city raise loyalty?

[2022-12-10 20:11:01] <EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> There are passive traits (like "parade") for certain skills that will increase loyalty if you're there

[2022-12-10 20:19:01] <EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> I think the main problem this game has is that once you reach a certain critical mass, the game doesn't really know what to do and you're stuck with a bunch of half-assed systems for diplomacy and town management while trying to put out fires everywhere

[2022-12-10 20:44:58] <%Dankey_Kangg> Death stranding had really good music
[2022-12-10 20:45:03] <%+Kodakan> pretty sure it was because of a civil war after the government tried to prohibit the production of nuggies NODDERS
[2022-12-10 20:45:04] <glow23> casualties we're made

[2022-12-10 20:45:07] <%Nice_turtle> Apocalypse was my fault
[2022-12-10 20:45:08] <%+DeNarm> nah there was a reason why corpses exploded

[2022-12-10 20:45:23] <%+FL0YDFAN> I thought death invaded the living world and your sister summoned it somehow???
[2022-12-10 20:45:37] <FPShod> oosebi
[2022-12-10 20:45:37] <%+thethorgot> you should really watch a recap, it's really clear when it's laid out in front of you MiniK
[2022-12-10 20:45:37] <%$TheMuznick> a voidout can get triggered and that leaves a giant crater
[2022-12-10 20:45:47] <roadcrewworker> i think kojjima writing is hacky af, but its also corny and funny so thats fine
[2022-12-10 20:45:50] <%$TheMuznick> I liked that they used that as an actual mechanic
[2022-12-10 20:45:56] <%Mellon_> it makes sense in the 4 hour credits KEKW
[2022-12-10 20:45:57] <%$TheCreepyDolphin> probably a few years right?

[2022-12-10 20:46:16] <%$TheMuznick> Director's Cut of Death Stranding is a big recommend for me
[2022-12-10 20:46:26] <%KoltonMcCombo> Kojima is the coolest dude ever
[2022-12-10 20:46:27] <%$jomyani> NODDERS
[2022-12-10 20:46:28] <%ppSLICK_> kojima really needs an aggressive editor
[2022-12-10 20:46:28] <%$TheMuznick> the new stuff they added was fun to play with
[2022-12-10 20:46:28] <%OOOO_Sebby> kojima has a style and he is very focused on it coming through
[2022-12-10 20:46:29] <%gabbaghoull> i think it’s intentionally that way, and it is funny and good
[2022-12-10 20:46:30] <%unifune> what does hacky mean in this context
[2022-12-10 20:46:36] <roadcrewworker> oh god yes he needs an editor so badly
[2022-12-10 20:46:38] <%$TheMuznick> NODDERS
[2022-12-10 20:46:40] <%Mellon_> needs a focuser
[2022-12-10 20:46:45] <+DRKO_> Is it possible to take some of those small towns near your city, or would that piss off that faction too much?
[2022-12-10 20:46:48] <toxicllama8> it was so good you remember none of it
[2022-12-10 20:46:51] <%+thethorgot> hacky (adj) see game of thrones
[2022-12-10 20:47:01] <%manfred_bratwurst> "this cut scene could have ended 30 minutes ago"
[2022-12-10 20:47:09] <%OOOO_Sebby> i think kojima has fun making what he makes and is unapologetic about it and good for him
[2022-12-10 20:47:10] <%SaturnsCollapsing> he gets very campy sometimes too
[2022-12-10 20:47:11] <%+DeNarm> someone who filters the really good from the weird and bad things to make like a more refined thing in the end
[2022-12-10 20:47:15] <%+Lord_Suiadan> Kojima never writes about characters favorite colors sadge
[2022-12-10 20:47:35] <FPShod> can you execute people in your city
[2022-12-10 20:47:36] <%unifune> would you consider cyberpunk 2077 hacky?
[2022-12-10 20:47:46] <%+Troll_Ascetic> I like the joke that stephen king doesn't know how to use the backspace key, and I think its kind of the same with kojima
[2022-12-10 20:47:50] <EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> Honestly, I think few modern games interest me as little as Death Stranding did
[2022-12-10 20:47:52] <%+oneamongthelost> glitchy
[2022-12-10 20:47:55] <%Jartin47> need some potatoes to go with the meat
[2022-12-10 20:47:57] <%$TripOutGaming> Was death stranding good? I just remember the meme's about being a walking simulator or something
[2022-12-10 20:48:00] <%9s_nine> are you excited for avatar 2
[2022-12-10 20:48:00] <+DOG_THE_DOG> as long as he keeps making interesting characters like quiet im all in NODDERS
[2022-12-10 20:48:02] <@%$DanTheVP> Cyberpunk 2077 is hacky cause helping the cops gets your street cred
[2022-12-10 20:48:03] <$corignis> Afternoon, bimp. Have ya executed any emperors, yet?
[2022-12-10 20:48:04] <EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> Maybe I'm being judgmental, but it seems awful to me
[2022-12-10 20:48:07] <shamusyea> Meet and bread, sandwiches for all!
[2022-12-10 20:48:13] <toxicllama8> cyberpunk is great now
[2022-12-10 20:48:13] <roadcrewworker> stephen king has said that he loves and really needs his editors tho

[2022-12-10 20:49:09] <+Clophen_> I'll probably go watch this one but I don't think i'll do the same with the next 4
[2022-12-10 20:49:16] <%Mellon_> Cult Classic now
[2022-12-10 20:49:21] <%unifune> austin powers
[2022-12-10 20:49:25] <+Jenny_F_T_B> I like that the first one the american military were terrorists
[2022-12-10 20:49:25] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> we need to return to practical effects
[2022-12-10 20:49:26] <shamusyea> One of thebest horror movies period
[2022-12-10 20:49:37] <%+DeNarm> it was weirdly satisfying to complete a bunch of settlements and roads
[2022-12-10 20:49:42] <%$corignis> Would you say Dragonheart is a cult classic?
[2022-12-10 20:49:52] <%Mellon_> KEKW
[2022-12-10 20:49:53] <%$corignis> Yep
[2022-12-10 20:49:55] <%+robbobert> i feel the same about avatar as I do about prometheus -- not a great movie, but the realization of going to/exploring/experiencing another world is what makes the movie for me. it's about the artistry
[2022-12-10 20:49:56] <%+GirthyD> most marvel earn billions and suck
[2022-12-10 20:50:00] <%gabbaghoull> Dragonheart is ass
[2022-12-10 20:50:06] <%+Troll_Ascetic> it didn't help it came out around ET, and its a very bleak take on aliens at a time when spielberg was the big thing

[2022-12-10 20:50:37] <+erniemctanker> Avatar was Ferngully 2.0
[2022-12-10 20:50:45] <restraintd> high quality props
[2022-12-10 20:50:58] <+scooty_puff_jr> I would take the practical effects like LOTR any day
[2022-12-10 20:50:58] <+zerofoot> yes, Kung Pao was a movie with amazing story and character development
[2022-12-10 20:51:00] <%WumboDude> @erniemctanker Trueing
[2022-12-10 20:51:01] <majesticfail> avatar = dances with wolves = the last samurai all 3 movies have the same plot

[2022-12-10 20:51:23] <%+harmontown89> Might be a hot take but reign of fire was a dope movie
[2022-12-10 20:51:27] <%+Troll_Ascetic> fury road did the same
[2022-12-10 20:51:28] <%$baconcopter> but what about Adam Driver???
[2022-12-10 20:51:29] <%pizzasub> Because they simply overuse CGI
[2022-12-10 20:51:29] <%manfred_bratwurst> the hobbit also failed to do that that
[2022-12-10 20:51:31] <%Taniel2Shot_> Lord of the Rings literally happened at the perfect time for CGI, not to much, but just enough to enhance
[2022-12-10 20:51:32] <%$TheMuznick> LOTR was a blend, the large shots you get with like Helms Deep and shit was CG
[2022-12-10 20:51:35] <%GravyTime> The trees were real right?
[2022-12-10 20:51:39] <%$corignis> Lord of the Rings also enjoyed a very long pre-production and planning cycle that did a LOT to make it successful
[2022-12-10 20:51:40] <%gabbaghoull> just green screen sound stage and collect the millions
[2022-12-10 20:51:44] <%Mellon_> Kung Pow is awesome
[2022-12-10 20:51:47] <Bjoll> stupid and amazing
[2022-12-10 20:51:48] <@%$DanTheVP> he does
[2022-12-10 20:51:50] <%GrandAeon> I bet Jurassic Park is still more impressive than Avatar 2 will ever be.
[2022-12-10 20:51:50] <%+Corking118> you broke a thermometer.... in my hands
[2022-12-10 20:51:50] <%exeswiss87> those red eyes scare me

[2022-12-10 20:55:32] <%AflacGoose> he wants to have some wobbly pops with the bruvs

[2022-12-10 23:05:40] <%baconinyourface> His contract for the Witcher was only for 3 seasons and apparently Netflix didn’t pony up the Superman money that dc is. Plus James Gunn running dc prolly excites him

[2022-12-10 23:06:30] <Dornhall> a lot of times studios probably wouldn't even finance something original, so you have to brand it as "halo" or whatever

[2022-12-10 23:07:33] <%volatile> after a village is captured by a new faction you can keep buying the food there to force them to starve and it will often rebel

[2022-12-10 23:07:42] <FlyingScrew> isnt there smuggling weapons or sonething
[2022-12-10 23:07:57] <%+thethorgot> um actually the MCU started with the Howard the Duck movie Nerdge
[2022-12-10 23:08:06] <%$Nanoni14> iron man 1 was really good
[2022-12-10 23:08:11] <%$wampasaurus> thats correct, he mentioned the avengers initiative at the end
[2022-12-10 23:08:14] <captain_quasar> apparently that was just the director making a nod and it turned into something huge
[2022-12-10 23:08:26] <%HumourlessPig> You can, gotta attack the linked villages to eliminate the food supply, drives Loyalty down fast.

[2022-12-10 23:08:37] <%MightyCreak> Hey @BarbarousKing, what made you replay Mount & Blade II? At the end of your last run you were pretty disappointed by the gameplay after a while

[2022-12-10 23:08:47] <%vesipera> There were 4 years between Iron man and The Avengers, you really have to build these things up
[2022-12-10 23:08:47] <%+thethorgot> @iwerewolve really? that movie was pretty average

[2022-12-10 23:54:30] <ssabackwards> Crush all rebellion!!!!
[2022-12-10 23:54:35] <%Dante_Draco> Tywin was a realist, and he was legit a VERY pragmatic and skilled ruler.
[2022-12-10 23:54:36] <%$Thrillbilly> The scenes in the book and show with Tywin and Arya showed Tywin had compassion
[2022-12-10 23:54:36] <%+TheHundaddy> ned was an idiot

[2022-12-10 23:55:26] <%$corignis> Tywin's long term plan is very bad. It's going to lead to the long-term destruction of his house, the bolton house, and the frey house.
[2022-12-10 23:55:28] <%+Ph3ster> or if their entire city is burned to ash
