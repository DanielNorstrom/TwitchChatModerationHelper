[2022-12-24 04:23:34] <%Lain_2779> The console features a seven-inch 1080p touchscreen that supports a 60Hz refresh rate, over 12 hours of battery life, as well as haptics, a gyroscope, and remappable controls. It doesn’t natively support 5G, though, nor includes a SIM card slot, so you’ll have to rely on Wi-Fi to stream anything to the console.

[2022-12-24 04:36:31] <%djuice_> Switch is based on Nvidia's hardware, and they have to wait for NVidia next mobile SOC first. Steamdeck is from AMD SOCs, just XBOX and Playstation.

[2022-12-24 04:47:07] <sshen13> Fun fact Final Fantasy was supposed to be the last game hence they call it Final, and it’s heavily inspired by gameplay of Ultima 3
[2022-12-24 04:47:17] <%+Rhuvian> @ArchSight It was named "final" because Squaresoft was going bankrupt when they released the first one. It ended up saving the company.

[2022-12-24 05:02:57] <%+Atreyu4800> yeahhh, it's one of those bundles ewwwwwww
[2022-12-24 05:02:58] <FriscoRPG> ya i hate bundles doing that
[2022-12-24 05:02:59] <Gjafar> i have that all
[2022-12-24 05:03:02] <+FattyFatPanda> they usually discount in this case
[2022-12-24 05:03:02] <%imShnaz> so steam messed that up
[2022-12-24 05:03:03] <LZanta> @LZanta oh, its hard to see that text lol
[2022-12-24 05:03:04] <$Star_Helix> it wasnt always that way but changed a few years ago
[2022-12-24 05:03:05] <akka108> Take all the monies
[2022-12-24 05:03:05] <Itz_Mango100> bundle is broken don't buy
[2022-12-24 05:03:07] <%+Val_Tom> That's weird. It generally shows what you already have and takes partial price out.
[2022-12-24 05:03:07] <+RyokoShaTV> Wow that’s stupid why is the bundle broke.
[2022-12-24 05:03:10] <bang_frkn_chow> just buy it gib us the extra Wowee
[2022-12-24 05:03:12] <%CyberAilurus> Most of them don't, I've bought bundles before too, it's a Bundle by Bundle basis
[2022-12-24 05:03:14] <rutle> Yeah some bundles do that.
[2022-12-24 05:03:15] <$zonedout36> it SHOULD discount
[2022-12-24 05:03:15] <%OldGamerJooky> steam needs its 30%
[2022-12-24 05:03:17] <$Star_Helix> sometimes it doenst double charge tho
[2022-12-24 05:03:22] <%chillarz> they be scammin
[2022-12-24 05:03:29] <+Skullcap8593> that bundle doesn't calculate correctly at all, was doing the same when I checked it
[2022-12-24 05:03:32] <FriscoRPG> some bundles are smart and dont charge though. this one is scammin @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-24 05:03:34] <JoshuaColossus> I bought many bundles with partially owned stuff, this is strange
[2022-12-24 05:03:34] <+XanianEmpire> apple wants 60%
[2022-12-24 05:03:43] <+大綿津見神 (owatatsumi)> Yeah, it's doing it for me too :/
[2022-12-24 05:03:45] <erlex248> Steam Admin here: You will "definitely" not be charged twice :)
[2022-12-24 05:03:47] <$Star_Helix> probably whatever the publisher asks for
[2022-12-24 05:03:48] <Gjafar> twos are missing
[2022-12-24 05:03:49] <Bkulan> Scummy bundle, normally you get further discounts if you already have parts of it
[2022-12-24 05:03:52] <%chillarz> insanity is a fun ride

[2022-12-24 05:06:03] <%+FunkySkunk> steam has 2 different kinda of bundles , collections and the bundles that discount owned. publishers choose how to sell it
[2022-12-24 05:06:04] <%The3Kingdoms> @BurkeBlack i believe what its doing is kinda like the Skyrim thing... every new version you buy at full price... not like buying just a DLC for it
[2022-12-24 05:06:05] <+femshepforever> DOW2 The Last Mode so great

[2022-12-24 05:06:10] <%+WastingSanity> I learned that the bundles can be broken when I went to purchase the bundle for WarHammer Fantasy I & II. I had 1 but not 2. It wanted to make me repurchase the first one again.

[2022-12-24 05:07:10] <erlex248> it's cheaper because you are buying all of it, no discount for not purchasing it as whole
[2022-12-24 05:07:10] <%KodaiRyu> pick "complete bundle" to save money @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-24 05:07:11] <!%CanHazBurritos> Is the mega bundle still less money than if you bought what you are missing unbundled?
[2022-12-24 05:07:24] <Gjafar> I have full collection but still can buy Kappa

[2022-12-24 05:07:33] <+Skullcap8593> most of the dlc for dawn of war 2 is just skins Burke after retribution and chaos rising
[2022-12-24 05:07:36] <%Barely_Einstein> Gladius is a slitherine game and the DLC is priced as such

[2022-12-24 05:08:40] <TrystnS> I noticed on two other bundles i was going to purchase recently that it seemed to no longer reduce price based on items you own. Not sure if its a glitch or steam policy change or just specific publishers

[2022-12-24 05:30:19] <$FataltheBaptist> is he doing an Inquisitor

[2022-12-24 05:30:33] <%PKM4STER> he could play a regular space marine and pull it off NODDERS
[2022-12-24 05:30:35] <CBCronin> Rogal Dorn is my guess
[2022-12-24 05:30:41] <%gobbleractually> he should be an orc
[2022-12-24 05:30:42] <$FataltheBaptist> he might do Eisenhorn

[2022-12-24 06:36:31] <%+Enigmal> Foxhunting was banned here in 2004 Burke.  Foxes aren't domestic but you do commonly see them in towns and cities at night they are not aggresive generally, but obviously very wary of humans

[2022-12-24 11:09:07] <%whydoestwitchtvhateme> a lot of people had issues with the HH novels because it changed how tall Astartes were and then said they were functionally immortal..

[2022-12-24 11:11:58] <NexusHives> Didn't the show runners say Cavill is difficult to work with?
[2022-12-24 11:11:58] <+SlimPickensZA> 40K adaptation has gotta be from a human's perspective. Most people in the Imperium don't even know what a Space Marine is. A story about a guardsman, or an inquisitor (Eisenhorn) would work the best, maybe have like an Astartes cameo to show how terrifyingly large they are etc.
[2022-12-24 11:12:03] <%jake_wu6410> @roughlife420 burkeKEKW yes
[2022-12-24 11:12:06] <%+Danidude88> Yeah

[2022-12-24 11:12:56] <+thehivemind1> It will be difficult getting the scale right without good CGI
[2022-12-24 11:12:56] <+roughlife420> oops
[2022-12-24 11:13:13] <%Rizla06> 40K seems like it would be better in anime style rather than live action
[2022-12-24 11:13:13] <%whydoestwitchtvhateme> @BurkeBlack how long until people complain for female Astartes
[2022-12-24 11:13:13] <+HouseOfPaincake> Henry Cavill left because he hated the direction the writers didn't give a shit about source material.

[2022-12-24 11:14:15] <CBCronin> They tried with figures in the past but they didn't sell, so they dropped the idea. It will happen again.
[2022-12-24 11:14:21] <%whydoestwitchtvhateme> @Malloc_III it didn't really... they just changed them to explain the true-scale minis
[2022-12-24 11:14:23] <NonNoticingSenpai> If they do, what would they do wit the Sisters of Battle. That was the whole point of them, to be the female Space Marines lol
[2022-12-24 11:14:23] <%xen_mind> if they change for money that's gr8, if they change because of PC fascist bullying them then thats terrible

[2022-12-24 11:44:53] <%xen_mind> never really understood dyson spheres, it's just a linear extrapolation of today's tech
[2022-12-24 11:45:11] <tappedoutcy> you don't need to build a complete dyson sphere for it to be worthwhile

[2022-12-24 11:45:37] <gojheera> have you played rift breaker?
[2022-12-24 11:45:43] <%+Rhuvian> I remember once reading a "largest sci-fi structures" article. The Dyson Sphere in TNG was by far the largest thing.
[2022-12-24 11:45:53] <Harmar> @xen_mind concept of basicly wrapping solar panels/power generation around a sun
[2022-12-24 11:45:58] <Mis_Las> If you use all resourses of all planets to make this sphere - not only sun BUT just WHOLE system
[2022-12-24 11:46:02] <@%A_P_P_L_E_S> @BurkeBlack you'd like riftbreaker honestly

[2022-12-24 12:30:14] <+TrockBronze> 40k on table top is rather involvedc and you will need to use things liek wahapedia and battlescribe
[2022-12-24 12:30:30] <%+Spellbot5000> GW may have been litigious and quashed any Warhammer mods for the game.

[2022-12-24 12:31:13] <+TrockBronze> with battlescribe you can make a list, then import it with yellowscribe and then apply it to the models you want. its complicated but makes sense if youy can be guided through
