[2022-12-07 18:01:40] <mikucoffee> Too young... what does that mean
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <Rarza> it's actually also amazing, IF you get in it
[2022-12-07 18:02:06] <mikucoffee> Bruh what
[2022-12-07 18:02:06] <Rarza> the high end is pretty amazing actually. but getting there... not as easy as you'd think :D
[2022-12-07 18:02:22] <mikucoffee> Young people don't get sick is such bullshit
[2022-12-07 18:02:24] <+cudez> I have Abilify maintena medication that costs 300euro per month - but I get it for free in Finland.... its basically an injection that I take 1 time per month for Psychosis
[2022-12-07 18:02:40] <mikucoffee> As a young person back when I was in elementary and such I was literally LIVING in the hospital
[2022-12-07 18:02:52] <%+aveliino88> in US the situation is pathetic considering they want to approve 840 billion military budget :D
[2022-12-07 18:03:28] <mikucoffee> @aveliino88 Aren't they like... in debt in trillions due to warfare???
[2022-12-07 18:03:48] <%+aveliino88> @aveliino88 it doesn't matter , they can add more money but the value will go down
[2022-12-07 18:04:02] <mikucoffee> The worst part I hear that medication is getting more expensive due to some bs that's happening in asia there
[2022-12-07 18:04:41] <%+aveliino88> @kuugels thats when the ''fun'' starts if u got very serious health problem, free healthcare is very limited to what they can give u
[2022-12-07 18:04:59] <+cudez> Medication is expensive if its under Patents... when med companies lose patents after 10years or so - they just add some compound to their old med and call it a "miracle" and charge tons again for it
[2022-12-07 18:05:41] <%+aveliino88> @kuugels they buy certain stuff and if it doesn't work for u bad luck, for example to cure tumors etc
[2022-12-07 18:05:49] <mikucoffee> @cudez "Business"
[2022-12-07 18:06:18] <+cudez> yeah @mikucoffee med-business is huge
[2022-12-07 18:06:30] <mikucoffee> @cudez Yep... its all about the money
[2022-12-07 18:06:36] <+cudez> yepge
[2022-12-07 18:06:38] <+kchille> @mikucoffee yeah trillions in debt. it sucks. our politicians are so corrupt. everything is about keeping us in wars that the majority of the population doesn't want to be involved in.
[2022-12-07 18:06:49] <+kchille> not to mention us sending billions to other countries to fund their wars.
[2022-12-07 18:06:52] <+kchille> it fucking sucks
