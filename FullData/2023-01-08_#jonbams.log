[2023-01-08 16:31:34] <+smitty_will> Foie gras is one of the most violent animal products available. Ducks and geese are force-fed a fatty corn-based substance through a tube that is inserted into their throats in a process called gavage. Large amounts of fat are deposited into the duck's liver, causing it to grow to up to ten times its normal size.

[2023-01-08 16:41:35] <%Hamparty> will it evolve into making music?
[2023-01-08 16:41:47] <Patman86> A simple google search gives the same for 20 years+

[2023-01-08 16:43:31] <goblinfig> Artists are against it also because the AI is trained off of stollen work

[2023-01-08 16:51:19] <%ktorn_> yes, your squashed remains would float, not hit a hard surface, just like in Saturn and Jupiter Cheer100 Cheer100
[2023-01-08 16:51:20] <%Hamparty> When pressure on a gas is increased, its molecules closer together, and its temperature is reduced, which removes enough energy to make it change from the gaseous to the liquid state.

You can then use the bell to draw water from a spring or well. If you have the water, you can boil it and make pink tea. Finally, you can let the tea cool down and store it in a bottle or container.

You can also put another small object in the bottle cap, such as a button or a pebble. If your headphones still work, you can listen to music with them. If the headphones stop working, you can throw them away or try to repair them.
