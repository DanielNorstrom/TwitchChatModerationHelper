[2023-01-09 05:40:38] <!%$Prof_PavloVT> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Grimmi. The humor is extremely fujo, and without a solid grasp of theoretical vtubing most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Grimmi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her character. Her personal philosophy draws heavily from BL literature. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just fujo
[2023-01-09 05:40:46] <$sumofty> @Prof_PavloVT based

[2023-01-09 05:41:01] <!%$Prof_PavloVT> they say something deep about LIFE. Therefore, people who dislike Grimmi truly ARE idiots. Of course, they wouldn't appreciate the humour in Grimmi's existential catchphrase "I am insane" which itself is a cryptic reference to Heartless. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Grimmi’s genius unfolds itself on their monitors. What fools. How I pity them. And yes, by the way, I DO have a Grimmi shirt. And no, you cannot see it.

They're about a human military officer and his extreme narcissism and cowardice that makes him seem ultra competent to the point that everyone sees him as hero.

[2023-01-09 05:55:54] <!%GinjiVitis> @heavenlyfather do you think you would psychologically handle becoming pregnant well or would it be panic?

[2023-01-09 07:04:57] <%Pond_water> Hello! PrideLionHey
[2023-01-09 07:05:00] <%galechronos> Grimmi, if you like Terry Pratchett and uplifting themes regarding death you should read the Discworld Death Books, especially  Reaper Man
[2023-01-09 07:05:03] <czerno333> sherlock holmes is completely public domain now, right?
[2023-01-09 07:05:21] <egoautemaeternumquodsolum> @czerno333 i dunno man, disney borked up the system

[2023-01-09 07:22:32] <%RomeoEchoDelta> That worked out phenomenally for Imperial Japan.
[2023-01-09 07:22:34] <czerno333> he did however directly suggest that the Good Guys start making war crime bombs, specifically meant to do war crimes
[2023-01-09 07:22:43] <%newtonia09> @Starfyre687 Well.... if you think about what happens in mistborn or warbreaker, attrocities is kinda normalized in YA
[2023-01-09 07:22:49] <%+griswalt17> War. War never changes.
[2023-01-09 07:22:51] <%newtonia09> but I do have a horrid sense of genre tbh
[2023-01-09 07:23:00] <%newtonia09> I consider the first law trilogy as YA

[2023-01-09 07:23:24] <zeromatter21> They specifically use the presents from the Games because people would recognize them

[2023-01-09 07:24:13] <%Starfyre687> The Hunger Games was basically "how terrible of a leader can I be - The Series"

[2023-01-09 07:37:40] <%SaiaiChan> marmalade boy is about a girl who is poor and goes to a rich kid school and The Thing You Expect happens

[2023-01-09 07:39:34] <riboku882> still kinda surprised that persona was male mc only
[2023-01-09 07:39:43] <%Nullamm> @SaiaiChan didn't they do that on PSP? I recall there being a p4 female protag
[2023-01-09 07:39:44] <riboku882> or mostly male only
[2023-01-09 07:39:51] <%+griswalt17> Yes, there is a society. And yes, we live in it.
[2023-01-09 07:39:59] <+Lukas_Ipsum> whats the term for stranger falls in love at first sight, works to make it work, finally earns the other's heart, and then dies?

[2023-01-09 07:40:43] <!%7192_ch> I think the term for that trope is "very depressing"
[2023-01-09 07:40:58] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Think I'd just call that depressing
[2023-01-09 07:41:00] <%+mountiefish> Somewhat off topic, but I just remembered the original Dracula novel is a reverse harem.

[2023-01-09 07:41:34] <%galechronos> Tropes. A troupe is like a circus or actor group
[2023-01-09 07:41:35] <%+nachtigalfinn> That's probably why the Saber ending in Fate was so depressing, since she built such a good rapport with both the audience and Shirou.
[2023-01-09 07:41:36] <%galechronos> but yes
[2023-01-09 07:41:39] <%galechronos> TVTropes is fun
