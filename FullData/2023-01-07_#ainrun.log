Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious. From the Mayo Clinic, a trusted source for medical stuff

[2023-01-07 07:23:27] <RIFFOSAURUS> you can bring your blood pressure up to normal by adding some stress to your daily life
[2023-01-07 07:23:29] <+randyybaby> so all ikn all youre basically dying
[2023-01-07 07:23:31] <actingvictor> high blood pressure would be worse
[2023-01-07 07:23:32] <%jellyfish_trifle> @EnSevenTea He's getting carried by summons now so it's less stress
[2023-01-07 07:23:33] <+randyybaby> all in all*
[2023-01-07 07:23:36] <%+prisonerbae> I actually had my nursing clinicals at the Mayo Clinic :3 I do not know how to advise ain doe

[2023-01-07 07:24:09] <%GetTwoBirdsStonedAtOnce> low BP can be related to being septic too
[2023-01-07 07:24:14] <%MeisterMaster2> Something to note, probably the most you'll ever see about your "low blood pressure" is your head might feel a little light when you stand up. That's about it

[2023-01-07 07:25:44] <RIFFOSAURUS> nah, the opposite probably, like a heart defense
[2023-01-07 07:25:45] <+johosaphatz> those arent necessarily related. high blood pressure is more assocaited with cardiac conditions
[2023-01-07 07:25:48] <jellydomo> i think they cancel each other out and you are invincible
[2023-01-07 07:25:49] <%+prisonerbae> Do you remember your actual bp value? Systolic/diastolic?
[2023-01-07 07:25:54] <harshyyness> depends on the cause, if it's stress and all then no but if its some other condition then yes
[2023-01-07 07:25:56] <%GetTwoBirdsStonedAtOnce> definitely try salt, but medication might be in your future

[2023-01-07 07:29:14] <%+prisonerbae> In nursing school they never made a fuss about low bp unless it’s a sign of progressive  heart failure which I doubt you have. Sometimes low bp can also cause heart to exert more, causing hypertrophy and contributing to hf.

[2023-01-07 07:48:05] <mrxzil420> would a blood thinner work?
[2023-01-07 07:48:05] <%Malimute100> thyroid issues are very uncommon do diagnose
[2023-01-07 07:48:06] <harshyyness> you have low or high bp?
[2023-01-07 07:48:09] <%Evander_Quisling> Thyroid panel isn't part of standard blood tests

[2023-01-07 07:48:20] <%+TheDarkLordSauronHimself> same
[2023-01-07 07:48:22] <neutles> you'd have to run a specific blood test for thyroid stuff
[2023-01-07 07:48:24] <%BigPissser> what are you doing
[2023-01-07 07:48:25] <+MonoGreenTea> The doctor didn't tell you anything because she doesn't know enough yet.  Blood for more info.
[2023-01-07 07:48:28] <harshyyness> for thyroid you need to do TSH test
[2023-01-07 07:48:32] <%BigPissser> cheesing the noble?
[2023-01-07 07:48:41] <%Malimute100> TSH and T4
[2023-01-07 07:48:45] <neutles> though, I think it's a reach imo because you don't have other thyroid symptoms
[2023-01-07 07:48:48] <%Evander_Quisling> Weight gain, low heart rate
[2023-01-07 07:48:57] <%Evander_Quisling> Feeling cold
[2023-01-07 07:48:57] <mrxzil420> I do that when I'm baked
[2023-01-07 07:49:03] <neutles> so, normally, if you have an underactive thyroid, you have an high activity and high BMI, and you're pretty thin
[2023-01-07 07:49:03] <+OathbreakerS> Twitch read MD Wiki
[2023-01-07 07:49:12] <harshyyness> i had weight gain and eczema has symptoms (had pimples on scalp)

[2023-01-07 08:56:05] <%+KianNArdalan> You know, I really do dig the RP potential of this challenge. Like a holy women reviving spirits of the past so that they can seek their vengeance and not fade into obscurity.

[2023-01-07 08:58:28] <+dragonviper_> exma
[2023-01-07 08:58:35] <+dragonviper_> is how everyone ive heard says it
[2023-01-07 08:58:37] <%Catharsis5HT> nah there are two pronunciations
[2023-01-07 08:58:44] <%+KianNArdalan> I mean, from my perspective, you're constantly in the fray needing to heal them so when the guy does the spinny attack, you can't escape.
[2023-01-07 08:58:46] <+dragonviper_> my sister has it and my family say exma
[2023-01-07 08:58:46] <$CheeseburgerChad> No it's the way Ain says it

[2023-01-07 08:58:56] <%MadKingHyperion> you were saying it the correct way Ain, at least thats the way Ive heard it for 30 years
[2023-01-07 08:58:58] <%kashhie> no the eczma is silent you pronunce is sug-ma

[2023-01-07 11:06:23] <%star0chris> I kicked Malenia for FOUR hours, that's right. I've been playing through Elden Ring using the WORST Ash of War available. No, really, it's TRASH. The kick Ash of War comes default to the character when you don't have a weapon and it costs no FP to use. That's cause it's total. garbage. and does so little damage that you basically have no reason to use it at all. UNLESS. you want to do something totally unnecessary. Something so meaningless, like KICKING BOSSES FOR HOURS.

[2023-01-07 11:22:17] <%meinMestar> ok this is a good one
[2023-01-07 11:22:23] <+lex_glad> i personally prefer golden order seal for the double A scaling

[2023-01-07 11:23:54] <%sad_goblin_96> you should take some breaks to get up and move and eat something for your health and to clear your head
[2023-01-07 11:23:56] <%HomieJuanKenobee> he was lower than 50
[2023-01-07 11:23:57] <ThatAccountBlaBlaBla> That stupid flame ring deals 2k damage
[2023-01-07 11:24:00] <+zDeivi> #bringbackrollo
[2023-01-07 11:24:01] <%meinMestar> fuck them buffs jsut spam heals
[2023-01-07 11:24:03] <+dragonviper_> rollo wouldve soloed easily
[2023-01-07 11:24:04] <kaninballe123> Remember Rollo guys?
[2023-01-07 11:24:11] <+dragonviper_> it is way better
[2023-01-07 11:24:16] <+lex_glad> A int and A faith
[2023-01-07 11:24:16] <!%MadKingHyperion> healing is based on faith scaling of your seal
[2023-01-07 11:24:17] <lunarticy> LUL
[2023-01-07 11:24:17] <%meinMestar> hyperion is die
[2023-01-07 11:24:19] <+dragonviper_> but requires 2 stats upgraded
[2023-01-07 11:24:23] <%HomieJuanKenobee> cause you need int for the golden order
[2023-01-07 11:24:24] <%meinMestar> vip Pog
[2023-01-07 11:24:25] <!%MadKingHyperion> golden order is half faith and int, so its less
[2023-01-07 11:24:26] <%glacia7> healing doesn'T scale with int lol
[2023-01-07 11:24:27] <+dragonviper_> @MadKingHyperion oh didnt know that
[2023-01-07 11:24:28] <+MadMagnux> Im so sad fuck my fat finger
[2023-01-07 11:24:32] <%why_damon> it is but if u only have points in faith right?
[2023-01-07 11:24:33] <%+AlwayssSad> Clap hyperion wins again
[2023-01-07 11:24:41] VIEWERS: 858
[2023-01-07 11:24:47] <!%MadKingHyperion> it also applies to weapon buffs
[2023-01-07 11:24:51] <+KingLeon_VII> Did u try malenia ?
[2023-01-07 11:24:52] <!%MadKingHyperion> no, its split
[2023-01-07 11:25:01] <!%MadKingHyperion> buffs and heals are based on faith only
[2023-01-07 11:25:06] <!%MadKingHyperion> not incant scaling in total
[2023-01-07 11:25:18] <dragonviper_> thats so dumb though
[2023-01-07 11:25:21] <+dragonviper_> why
[2023-01-07 11:25:23] <!%MadKingHyperion> so the highest faith scaling comes from erdtree seal +10 over 67 faith
[2023-01-07 11:25:34] <!%MadKingHyperion> 66 and below from +25 finger seal
[2023-01-07 11:25:37] <%sad_goblin_96> hyperion is vip yayy
[2023-01-07 11:25:39] <%why_damon> u just need more faith PRAYING
[2023-01-07 11:25:46] <+lex_glad> gotta have faith
[2023-01-07 11:25:52] <!%MadKingHyperion> which is why i said to get faith to 80
[2023-01-07 11:26:12] <!%MadKingHyperion> scaling doesnt matter, its split vs single stat
[2023-01-07 11:26:14] <SpicyWe1ner> Cheat in the 80
[2023-01-07 11:26:19] <+dragonviper_> it should work differently imo
[2023-01-07 11:26:24] <!%MadKingHyperion> just the incant scaling, not S or A
[2023-01-07 11:26:24] <+dragonviper_> like all other spells

[2023-01-07 11:29:30] <+dragonviper_> also most spells have been majorly buffed since release
[2023-01-07 11:29:54] <ThatAccountBlaBlaBla> Lords Heal range is so shit tho, compared to DS2 ranges, where you almost cover the whole area LUL
[2023-01-07 11:29:59] <+narulynn> do do u guys think i should play  ?

[2023-01-07 11:30:16] <+lex_glad> erdtree heal has crazy range, but you get it after this
[2023-01-07 11:30:31] <+dragonviper_> @narulynn keep at it and youll get it eventually, the feeling of overcoming it after struggling a tonne is worth it
[2023-01-07 11:30:34] <%lazycoffee_bean> you were close this time
[2023-01-07 11:30:36] <%meinMestar> @narulynn the start of the game is particularly diffiuclt and annoying

[2023-01-07 12:01:51] <%+mahana85> I am not a doctor so qualified to say that low means usually that your heart is weak
[2023-01-07 12:01:54] <%meinMestar> there isnt such a thing as "low blood pressure" if you dont have symptoms and its not becasue of a physical illness or something
