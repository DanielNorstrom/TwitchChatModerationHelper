[2022-12-28 13:53:03] <%+gtamarverick> So a few months ago I bought a 3080 12gb, altho I needed a better processor/motherboard for it to actually perform. so I've been saving up for a new processor motherboard and watercooling for cpu. I'm wondering what kind of power usage I need 750W or 850W
[2022-12-28 13:53:26] <@%Dezzybtw> @gtamarverick 750 causes 30 series to thermal throttle
