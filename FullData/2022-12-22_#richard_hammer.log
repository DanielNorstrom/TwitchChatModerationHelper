[2022-12-22 06:25:50] <$Dishonest_abe> the atmosphere in this game is perfect
[2022-12-22 06:25:54] <!%Ellieanna> depends on the bear, brown bears and black bears act extremely different, one of them gives no fucks, and will kill you, even if they are full

[2022-12-22 09:54:58] <!%Calastigro> anchovies are a good pizza topping, but you only need like 1-2 per slice, and imo it's best just anchovies and cheese

[2022-12-22 09:55:31] <JiboTV> @Calastigro You gotta get the right ones, interesting enough most use really cheap and overly salted ones. You can get lighter salt and much longer ones that are much more palatable.

[2022-12-22 11:45:44] <%Tomijiro> if its says he died to a wolf, he died to a wolf.
[2022-12-22 11:46:33] <%Lakart> Speaking of death, had my first water turtle death. The one with the deformed spine randomly passed in the night, must have been deformed on the inside as well.
