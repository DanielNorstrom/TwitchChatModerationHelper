[2023-01-07 03:15:28] <%kalbSchnitzler> Cheer100  Penile fracture: You can fracture your penis if too much force is put on it while it's erect, including during sex or when masturbating. You might hear a crack or a pop. As there is no bone in the penis, you can't have a broken penis the way you might have a broken leg. However, the soft tissue in the penis can tear, causing a bruised penis and pain. A fractured penis needs urgent surgery, preferably within 6 hours of the fracture.
