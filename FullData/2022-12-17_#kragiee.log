[2022-12-17 11:35:33] <%+FrankieBagOChips> you should try out Celsius, taste way better than monster and supposed to be healthier

[2022-12-17 11:40:13] <%+bubbagunnnn> but its a grind not good for casual players
[2022-12-17 11:40:25] <%+bubbagunnnn> who also want to rank up
[2022-12-17 11:40:26] <hypers_101> i think it gives a larger boost to new accs was climbing an olf bronze acc 3x my teamates stats and didnt go this quick

[2022-12-17 11:40:50] <HK_Shobu> ye system is good, I'm currently Plat 2 on my smurf and playing against ppl that where GM3 in season 0
[2022-12-17 11:40:51] <%zacku> it makes you hardstuck alot
[2022-12-17 11:41:10] <nicejohnson> Yeah they ruined it for people like you ngl
[2022-12-17 11:41:11] <Svetdwell> is doom good now?
[2022-12-17 11:41:36] <+Josi_wvx> I have a silver acc that getting put against gm and master players
[2022-12-17 11:41:54] VIEWERS: 432
[2022-12-17 11:42:00] <gobbybgoblin> I got in a lucky winning streak and went straight to gold. I’m a mercy player so I have to depend on the team to actually do good. This next season, the queue has been pretty bad.
[2022-12-17 11:42:19] <%zacku> support is so hard to climb
[2022-12-17 11:42:20] <Fahado0od> I'm a Diamond that had all his diammond lobbies filled with masters and GM, I've never hit gm with tank too
[2022-12-17 11:42:32] <+IRepaz> if they put someone in a higher rank lobby to test something the others players will rage about it cuz they throw with it
[2022-12-17 11:42:34] <%zacku> its probably the longest role to unranked to gm rn
[2022-12-17 11:42:37] <uselessdonut123> tank role is a bit overwhelming rn imo
[2022-12-17 11:42:48] <%letsjustwip3> no zarya
[2022-12-17 11:42:56] <%hskaz> Every day when I play the first 3-4 games I almost always win. after these wins i get 2-3 matches where even though my game is the same (all stats are equal to the previous one) most of the time my dps don't use brain. is it possible that I get people to the team who also have a win streak and in the opposite team there are stronger players from a higher rank who lost their games @kragiee
[2022-12-17 11:43:33] <uselessdonut123> to be fair, i haveent seen smurf accounts after ow2. The matchmaking has just been absolute dogshit wtih 5 different ranks in the sam game
[2022-12-17 11:43:54] VIEWERS: 432

[2022-12-17 11:44:15] <%zacku> all t500 smurf
[2022-12-17 11:44:49] <gobbybgoblin> I got players that are legit bad at bastion.  I’m not like people who will get mad at you for playing a hero. I’m a player that gets mad at you because you continue to play something knowing you are not doing much to benefit the team. If your dps is going 1/7 then they are not good at the hero they were playing. They are probably not good at dps either.

[2022-12-17 11:45:43] <%Bexypie> I find I'd go 5-0 and then lose 6 games before getting to 7 wins.
[2022-12-17 11:45:51] <%zacku> nothing is stopping you from sitting on grandma
[2022-12-17 11:45:53] <gobbybgoblin> I legit tell them to not play dps again when playing ranked and say go back to quickplay.

[2022-12-17 11:47:37] <gobbybgoblin> Wtf
[2022-12-17 11:47:44] <%zacku> the only bad thing about ow2 gameplay is comp rn
[2022-12-17 11:47:45] <uselessdonut123> ow2 is more polished with added bullsht. i wanna go back to ow1 at this point

[2022-12-17 11:47:58] <gobbybgoblin> Comp is always bad
[2022-12-17 11:48:07] <%zacku> you get punished too much for losing in 2
[2022-12-17 11:48:07] <HK_Shobu> I hate that they hide so much info. I loved to see my SR points and my stats compared to others on external sites. or see ranks ingame...
[2022-12-17 11:48:07] <gobbybgoblin> Bad for health and mentality
[2022-12-17 11:48:26] <!%Mikeverv> For me the fun part of early ow1 was learning the game
[2022-12-17 11:48:51] <Red_Russet> Even quick play feels like comp now in ow2
[2022-12-17 11:48:53] <%hskaz> yes in ow1 when you had over 50% win rate you climbed in ow2 i have over 50% win rate on every hero and im still in the same rank because i finish like 7-5, 7-4  etc
[2022-12-17 11:48:55] <Jeano135> I miss when rein was considered THE main tank to pick
[2022-12-17 11:49:28] <dorev_> Abusing op role that's a bit silly Kappa

[2022-12-17 11:50:01] <theLiamsNissan> that's the same in OW1
[2022-12-17 11:50:12] <ReeferChiefer> I don't see why they hide any rank progression until you get 7 wins lmao. No other game hides rank progression like that
[2022-12-17 11:50:16] <smileysmiles1989> hello everybody
[2022-12-17 11:50:17] <Jeano135> It's just impossible to escape the forced 50/50 lol

[2022-12-17 12:38:00] <Bezemgast> Maybe somebody else on the team can hit the target as well during hook to kill him, so hog won't go running off alone soloing the other team

[2022-12-17 12:43:24] <Bezemgast> but that isn't valid for 99.9% of the playerbase. In the end they balance for the players
[2022-12-17 12:43:25] <jovach23> some silver widows can aim

[2022-12-17 12:43:41] <TheVulgarBulgar> I don't entirely agree; you can balance for casuals to some degree, but it's okay to have heroes fall off in high ranks
[2022-12-17 12:43:44] <+peekaayfire> rank transparency someday? or perma mystery in ow2?
[2022-12-17 12:43:47] <+archerclas> the game should be fun for casual plays but balanced at high level

[2022-12-17 12:44:14] <TheVulgarBulgar> For example, Moira was intended to very powerful in low ranks (easy to aim, get good value), but in high ranks, Ana's sleep and nade are better value
[2022-12-17 12:44:14] <jovach23> she has way too many shots on her ult
[2022-12-17 12:44:17] <jovach23> its silly

[2022-12-17 12:44:24] <Fazuul> I'm a scrub and I agree that balance should be around the top tier players. Dota 2 does that, seems fine.

[2022-12-17 13:26:15] <%BeenDoinked> checks and balances - congress proposes, judicial branch validates whether the proposed law is constitutional, and the pres says yes or no

[2022-12-17 13:27:19] <jovach23> thats why they need a majority

[2022-12-17 13:28:20] <zack5551> the president doesn't make laws
[2022-12-17 13:28:22] <%BeenDoinked> no, because the president has to sign off on any proposed bills

[2022-12-17 13:28:31] <+joshokitty> they cant take over his job but they can make laws against his agenda. like when trump was in the white house, the democrats had the congress and they passed legislation that he didnt care for

[2022-12-17 13:29:15] <+Sa1yanZ> he has a say at the final stage. president signs the bill into law. but he/shew cant start the process
[2022-12-17 13:29:17] <+EhudLFG> Congress can vote to pass new legislation, but the POTUS can also decide whether or not to sign it into law, or veto it.

[2022-12-17 14:32:05] <triax6> the oven should always be prewarmed
[2022-12-17 14:32:17] <kaiber666> You’re ment to pre heat the oven because the food will cook faster like that @kragiee
[2022-12-17 14:32:18] <jovach23> just get an air fryer

[2022-12-17 16:49:44] <primate115> @kragiee After playing for a while, do you think 6v6 was better than 5v5? I do
[2022-12-17 16:49:53] <ahmetyanov> always 💀

[2022-12-17 16:52:34] <Alforofuss> Like most what people were complaining about in ow1 was double shield, and they did remove shield from Orisa. So I think having 2 tanks still wouldn't be as bad as it was if they keep Orisa without one.
[2022-12-17 16:53:02] <drewzzyhere> Orisa is so fuckin fun

[2022-12-17 16:53:29] <primate115> @Kighzen good point, the only thing i kinda miss is the zarya tank synergy. Double shield meta was cringe

[2022-12-17 17:43:57] <%Teletolumby> buffing soldier also helps with roadhog
[2022-12-17 17:44:02] <tricky_tracky> duration maybe?
[2022-12-17 17:44:04] <bukoyas> You know how they made hanzo ult not able to be damage boosted because it used to counter zen trance in grav? They should do the same with soj and make her rail undamage-boostable
[2022-12-17 17:44:04] <Grenoybel> hot take indeed, mercy should be reworked
[2022-12-17 17:44:06] <ShatteredXzz> do you think soldier would be meta if he had 20 damage per bullet again? or even 19?

[2022-12-17 17:44:26] <maxdarner567> @bukoyas thats a really good idea
[2022-12-17 17:44:29] <VikingJackAU> Instead of damage boosting, mercy should one hand her staff for 1/2 healing and get to use her glock at the same time Kapp
[2022-12-17 17:44:35] <Buizeru> maybe damage boosting needs to be an ability that has a duration, rather than applied until they remove it
[2022-12-17 17:44:38] <ruffles___> 18 dmg
[2022-12-17 17:44:39] <@%emmy_ish> even as a mercy enjoyer, i would like to see damage boost redone or changed
