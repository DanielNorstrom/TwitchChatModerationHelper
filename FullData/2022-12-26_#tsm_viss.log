[2022-12-26 17:37:14] <%+gluten_free_water> @MstrFriendship unfortunately, at least in NA, very few players
[2022-12-26 17:37:14] <%+killacouga> they made super people 2 LUL

[2022-12-26 17:37:50] <%+gluten_free_water> @MstrFriendship their launch and marketing strategy kinda killed the game
[2022-12-26 17:37:50] <ShermanJames> PubG feels clunky and slow compared to other BRs. I think honestly players just want a faster paced game.
[2022-12-26 17:38:01] <%$MstrFriendship> @gluten_free_water I just took a look at the steam listing. Rebranded as Super People 2 already

[2022-12-26 17:38:51] <%+gluten_free_water> @MstrFriendship yea, the whole process was confusing and killed the momentum the game had.  The daily tourneys was a great idea, but mismanaged the launch
[2022-12-26 17:39:12] <hettislettis> that tire pop was not bad

[2022-12-26 18:16:14] <%+TankNewton> isn't there still a chance you could get banned? even off stream? think Doc doesn't want to risk his friends getting banned

[2022-12-26 18:54:59] <!%TrashDaddy2020> you have to walk back over there and talk up your router in a baby voice. needs some words of encouragement. if that goesnt work talk shit to it. and the final step use only as a last resort. just it like like you would an old tv or like how you do in the dash of your car.
