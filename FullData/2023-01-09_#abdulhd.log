[2023-01-09 23:49:22] <+kartinamusic> I finally beat it again on New Game+ this year, took like 31 hours. Nice having all the guns and upgrades etc
[2023-01-09 23:49:45] <%El_MexinacanHD> but normally towards the later part of stream you are more tired so dont you miss thing dosing off?
[2023-01-09 23:50:11] <itsbruno999> why is uncharted good, i dont like it

[2023-01-09 23:57:01] <+omcmahonmedia> The majority seem to hate the second game because of part 2 (playing as Abby) but for me it's the best bit. Adds depth to a standard revenge story & sends a good message
