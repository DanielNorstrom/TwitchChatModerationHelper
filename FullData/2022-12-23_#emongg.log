[2022-12-23 00:00:03] <%ne0n_black> mayo is amazing and actually easy af to make at home
[2022-12-23 00:00:06] <%ChipJiggins> If I had a wish, I would sweat mayo
[2022-12-23 00:00:08] <Augmented_1> mayo is gross
[2022-12-23 00:00:12] <+felds> @citizenbystander good mayo = best sauce
[2022-12-23 00:00:15] <%ne0n_black> you can infuse the oil to make delicious flavored mayo
[2022-12-23 00:00:15] <%MelBuggin> pie is best
[2022-12-23 00:00:23] <%blondejohn96> blood and kidney? fuck yes
[2022-12-23 00:00:23] <%MelBuggin> but whole fruit pie is just cobbler.
[2022-12-23 00:00:25] <%Brynx666> pie is a pretty big range

[2022-12-23 01:03:46] <IPyrrhosI> Hey, I am fairly new at overwatch (2 months) and would still consider myself pretty decent - DPS and Tank at least. The thing is that I don't understand what criteria is involved in order to rank up? I usually have around a 3 K/D in matches, and 10k-12k points and still am stuck in silver... What are the criterias, do you know?

[2022-12-23 01:20:37] <%faultysaeg> @esmojinx Pretty much all modern console FPS have some degree of aim assist that can be very strong.
[2022-12-23 01:20:37] <%+BunnyGunGaming> gyro is good for micro movements

[2022-12-23 01:20:43] <%N30NxL1T3x> gyro is always bad
[2022-12-23 01:20:48] <%+BunnyGunGaming> sticks are for BIG movement, gyro is for smaller movements

[2022-12-23 01:49:50] <%widowmakre> the default button to heal is the right trigger (atleast for xbox)

[2022-12-23 01:50:13] <+aj7continue> because moira on console doesn't heal enough
[2022-12-23 01:50:14] <+KalySharky> It makes perfect sense, on consoles primary fire on games is always on Right Trigger
[2022-12-23 01:50:14] <%widowmakre> they are on PC too, the default is left click to heal
[2022-12-23 01:50:15] <IsyBlaze> right trigger is primary fire
[2022-12-23 01:50:18] <memicah> it's not left and right, it's primary and secondary

[2022-12-23 02:40:55] <%$TheNastyFridge> @oonga_balungga I think two of the most basic Sigma tips are: 1) Don't treat your shield like a Rein-shield and leave it just sitting in the open, use it to block specific cooldowns 2) Use your Eat/Shift as your Oh-Shit button
