[2022-12-26 17:14:19] <+VoodoKid> is there tax evasion in this game aswell?
[2022-12-26 17:14:32] <MissBatAttack> Tax collectors residing in the depths of the void seem fitting
[2022-12-26 17:15:07] <JarlElbowses> It's actually just a completely pitch black room where the tax collector dwells before being unleashed upon the unsuspecting villagers.

[2022-12-26 17:18:50] <CapnSlipp> There isn’t.  It’s specifically not a “gamer-y” game.  It’s a chill sandboxy game.  Especially fantastic with lots of content mods for additional buildings, decorations, resources, goods.

[2022-12-26 17:19:04] <JarlElbowses> Microsoft Flight sim is definitely a fighting game when I'm fighting the forces of gravity from sucking me into the ground
[2022-12-26 17:19:05] <justblunders> the conflict in flight simulator is the game doing what you tell it and then you blaming the game when the plane crashes

[2022-12-26 18:28:50] <+patchre> The game is very slow.

[2022-12-26 18:33:42] <Avram42> I'm not sure if this Foundation is very accurate to Asimov's source material.

[2022-12-26 18:34:29] <+NorthernSimon> tell us about your climax
[2022-12-26 18:34:29] <Gameboy9553> It's a gentle build rather thana climax
[2022-12-26 18:34:33] <%danger2007> I often paint when I watch the VODs

[2022-12-26 18:35:07] <%itsjust_Kev> so, the game needs more incremental progression goals?
[2022-12-26 18:35:07] <+savealot2> Ever since i've started AA i've have a hard time climaxing too lefongSmokey
[2022-12-26 18:35:26] <markitta> you send troops of map and they do quest
[2022-12-26 18:35:27] <weasel9999> I think building large, modular buildings are the "highlight"
[2022-12-26 18:35:28] <+NorthernSimon> a climax one could say
[2022-12-26 18:35:33] <Silver_Glaceon> There isn't LUL You can send troops to complete quests
[2022-12-26 18:35:34] <Gameboy9553> What about fires or collapse?

[2022-12-26 18:35:50] <+smash_that_like> no its a slow burn, also the economy starts to shut down late game due to not enough people
[2022-12-26 18:35:53] <markitta> there is no climax and
[2022-12-26 18:35:53] <crialwastaken> no serotonin for you sir
[2022-12-26 18:35:55] <Silver_Glaceon> And there are like, achievement milestones
[2022-12-26 18:35:57] <IpsosCustodes> it actually turns into vampire survivors in the end game
[2022-12-26 18:36:00] <markitta> you just build huge stuff
[2022-12-26 18:36:05] <murrmakesstuff> My only experience with this game is watching letsgameitout play it
[2022-12-26 18:36:06] <Silver_Glaceon> Or village aspirations on the bottom left
[2022-12-26 18:36:06] <%+labrucebruce> I think its mostly about enjoying the place running smoothly and growing
[2022-12-26 18:36:10] <ChilliDogDave> where i live theres a "bethesda street" so technically i live near bethesda HQ Kappa
[2022-12-26 18:36:22] <murrmakesstuff> I live near an Ikea street
[2022-12-26 18:36:40] <BaslerJones> if you could actually control your army in a rts way it would be cool
[2022-12-26 18:36:42] <murrmakesstuff> named as such as there is an ikea next to it
[2022-12-26 18:36:43] <+codysmokey> seems like a pretty generic micromanagment sim tbh.
[2022-12-26 18:36:45] <AncientHakutaku> needs more tik tok and fortnite dancing
[2022-12-26 18:36:45] <Silver_Glaceon> Manor Lords might fill that military conflict itch though 👀

[2022-12-26 18:36:55] <+arthurdsy> it would be better if it was also a tower/waves defense lol
[2022-12-26 18:36:55] <+Gamoranin> Some games are great without tension, but humanity requires challenge.
[2022-12-26 18:36:59] <%itsjust_Kev> the title kinda gives you the theme of the game, tbf. Foundation doesn't connote much drama or excitement. Just steady?
[2022-12-26 18:36:59] <Gameboy9553> Frewin not Rowin'
