[2022-12-16 00:35:49] <%+PrimoBrand> at this point Warrior need a rework on the class
[2022-12-16 00:36:04] <+Qosmo_> why?
[2022-12-16 00:36:27] <%+PrimoBrand> cuz i can't play wallet warrior anymore Kappa
[2022-12-16 00:36:40] <%UmbraDeath> Sadge
[2022-12-16 00:37:09] <shopherodobrasil> you play this wainting for druid or something big
[2022-12-16 00:37:10] <milimar296> priest is better for spreader
[2022-12-16 00:37:10] <+lilv00m> Works well in priest
[2022-12-16 00:37:22] <%+PrimoBrand> Naga + smokescreen maybe
[2022-12-16 00:37:39] <%+PrimoBrand> the 4 mana naga*
[2022-12-16 00:38:13] <SnarfPHD> How about the 1 deathrattle set up minion and Infectious Ghoul?
[2022-12-16 00:38:51] <+Qosmo_> explosive sheep and explo ghoul
[2022-12-16 00:39:05] <fjagamer2> I had a lot of fun in nathria with an explosive smokescreen rogue
[2022-12-16 00:39:05] <@^Nightbot> Check out latest YouTube video: Concoctions Are Very Valuable In Wild - https://youtu.be/flSP92nLyLg
[2022-12-16 00:39:15] <fjagamer2> and it got me to d5 at least

[2022-12-16 00:40:48] <zantomun> it's pronounced shi-those

[2022-12-16 00:42:21] <TheOnlyNoobInTown> its kinda hard to get that much armor that early though
[2022-12-16 00:42:22] <zantomun> i gotta question the thought process of being in dumpster legend and thinking yeah, im gonna climb some more with uninteractive tier 1 decks
[2022-12-16 00:42:46] <%UmbraDeath> interesting triHmm
[2022-12-16 00:42:51] <shopherodobrasil> no minions yep
[2022-12-16 00:42:55] <zantomun> they still create tokens like the lifesteal guys
[2022-12-16 00:43:01] <zantomun> 5Head
[2022-12-16 00:43:35] <%+PrimoBrand> @zantomun there's a lot of bad players that can't successfully climb was even with tier s decks
[2022-12-16 00:43:59] <%+PrimoBrand> but the deck itself carries them to legend
[2022-12-16 00:43:59] <Narstotzka> skill issue
[2022-12-16 00:45:14] <+ABadxMan> savory delight shows as well
[2022-12-16 00:45:18] <+ABadxMan> works similarly
[2022-12-16 00:46:00] <dkaspersky> forsen
[2022-12-16 00:46:04] <shopherodobrasil> i guess blizz hates you
[2022-12-16 00:46:08] <%+PrimoBrand> plague spreader better in priest i guess

[2022-12-16 00:46:54] <LuckySalmon777> if you like deathrattle stuff, you might enjoy a take on secret rogue w sketchy, halkias, and mad scientist
[2022-12-16 00:48:00] <%$Takkon> its better in preist when you can resurrect it
[2022-12-16 00:48:07] <+drop_table_subs> lol I thought plaguespreader was a priest card cuz that's the only class it's played in standard
[2022-12-16 00:49:14] <%+ababyduck> hi dane, what did you remove from discard lock for the shallow grave from your tweet?
[2022-12-16 00:49:41] <LuckySalmon777> disco player spotted WeirdChamp
[2022-12-16 00:49:43] <zantomun> dane im not gonna lie, this might be the worst disruption deck ive ever seen
[2022-12-16 00:49:47] <%+ababyduck> thank <3
[2022-12-16 00:49:59] <SnarfPHD> In standard people use Illusionist and Infectious Ghoul to make an unkillable board. Maybe you could make a similar deck, but ramped up for wild.
[2022-12-16 00:50:25] <%GuapoPescado> dane i know that scourge illusionist deck is good in standard right now
[2022-12-16 00:50:51] <%GuapoPescado> yeah i think so
[2022-12-16 00:50:56] <%+PrimoBrand> @snarfphd so... a Thadius deck SeemsGood
[2022-12-16 00:51:21] <zundabar123> the real illusion was that illusionist might be good
[2022-12-16 00:51:55] <%+PrimoBrand> illusionist is good, but not stand alone good
[2022-12-16 00:52:27] <%+PrimoBrand> it works well in the highroll naga+smokescreen package
[2022-12-16 00:55:59] <%$BaronVonLame> forsenPls
[2022-12-16 00:57:02] <Kallenger> enrage warrior is trash now?
[2022-12-16 00:58:11] <%+PrimoBrand> don't you have diamond olgra?
[2022-12-16 00:58:57] <dumbledohh> a deck built around one card? what could go wrong
[2022-12-16 00:59:16] [Notification] Tr011bert subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 70 months! [Cheers brother.]
[2022-12-16 00:59:46] <%Dijoxin> @danehearth you know they stopped patron from giving corpses, did they include that wax elemental (5/1) you can get from kazakus drake?
[2022-12-16 01:01:39] <umjev> wax elemental dies to corpse explosion anyways
[2022-12-16 01:01:45] <umjev> doesn’t matter if it gives a corpse or not
[2022-12-16 01:01:56] <bigdgamerboi> No hobbsKey ?
[2022-12-16 01:01:59] <bigdgamerboi> Sadge
[2022-12-16 01:02:11] <%+PrimoBrand> it matter, if it giver a corpse the explosion goes "infinitely"
[2022-12-16 01:02:21] <%+PrimoBrand> gives*
[2022-12-16 01:03:01] <%Dijoxin> well almost, has a cap of dying 51 times
[2022-12-16 01:04:34] <bigdgamerboi> Resummon Gnomeferatu and give it reborn?
[2022-12-16 01:04:39] <bigdgamerboi> PogChamp
[2022-12-16 01:04:43] <zundabar123> didn't things like corpse explosion/repeat effects used to have a cap of 14?
[2022-12-16 01:04:47] <shopherodobrasil> use banker to put an extra copy on deck
[2022-12-16 01:05:05] <bigdgamerboi> hobbsLeper
[2022-12-16 01:05:18] <umjev> @primobrand if you corpse explosion on a wax rager it will stop reviving eventually
[2022-12-16 01:05:23] <%+PrimoBrand> corpse goes on untill the last minion on board dies or you out of corpses
[2022-12-16 01:06:34] <umjev> wax rager will eventually stop reviving
[2022-12-16 01:06:38] <umjev> do you understand
[2022-12-16 01:07:03] <umjev> arcanisr and perpetual flame can both do this
[2022-12-16 01:07:04] <%+PrimoBrand> i do, i even quoted infinitely to avoid confusion
[2022-12-16 01:07:15] <TheOnlyNoobInTown> good old zoolock vs cubelock games
[2022-12-16 01:08:23] <%+PrimoBrand> I'm not sure if there's still a infinite loop in hearthstone

[2022-12-16 01:08:38] <shopherodobrasil> renathal?
[2022-12-16 01:08:45] <SnarfPHD> How does the Undertaker work with the Devourer of Souls?
[2022-12-16 01:09:08] <%+PrimoBrand> devourer is not a deathrattle minion
[2022-12-16 01:09:22] <%+PrimoBrand> is more like a aura
[2022-12-16 01:09:55] <%+PrimoBrand> so undataka does not get it's deathrattle
[2022-12-16 01:10:17] <%+PrimoBrand> same as a undataka another undataka
[2022-12-16 01:10:40] <SnarfPHD> I get that Undataka doesn't copy it, but does it copy the Undataka? That's what I was wondering.
[2022-12-16 01:11:03] <%+PrimoBrand> oh, than i guess it does
[2022-12-16 01:13:17] <%+PrimoBrand> can you try some big shaman today? last time the luck was garbage, might do better today :)

[2022-12-16 01:54:34] <%+PrimoBrand> arthas and jaina had a thing

[2022-12-16 01:56:01] <anbu_guy> I'm confused about something else , who was the lich king before arthas ?
[2022-12-16 01:56:14] <@%Duje200> no one
[2022-12-16 01:56:17] <+ledyhd> no one yeah
[2022-12-16 01:56:24] <+ledyhd> arthas  was the first lich king
[2022-12-16 01:56:28] <HegelianCope> nerzhul in shambles
[2022-12-16 01:56:32] <+ledyhd> teron gorefiend was the first death knight
[2022-12-16 01:56:34] <ghastlygravedigger> who was the second?
[2022-12-16 01:56:34] <Dannyvinicius> some kind of entity, right?
[2022-12-16 01:56:44] <+ledyhd> @ghastlygravedigger bolvar gigachad
[2022-12-16 01:56:58] <+Qosmo_> the lich king was whoever weared the helm of domination
[2022-12-16 01:57:02] <ghastlygravedigger> oh the burning guy
[2022-12-16 01:57:02] <LuckySalmon777> @anbu_guy I think there was an orc dude who died, possesed the armor, and chose arthas as his champion to success him

[2022-12-16 02:49:22] <@^Nightbot> Mozaki is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all, you drop it on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you some memes to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little dude that can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.

[2022-12-16 05:10:26] <DameNightmare> convoke as a win condition lol
[2022-12-16 05:10:52] <+Benconroy> The joy is in the mystery of not knowing
[2022-12-16 05:11:18] <amurotensei> ignorance is bliss @Benconroy
[2022-12-16 05:11:38] <DameNightmare> nuetral wepaons and spells should never have been a thing
[2022-12-16 05:11:47] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> I tried plague spreader with Da Undatakah and N'Zoth, looks like Yogg might be a better fit
[2022-12-16 05:12:05] <DameNightmare> but wnat if nzoth or untakah gets changed
[2022-12-16 05:12:35] <DameNightmare> demon hunter is only class that can relaly safely troll wiht plague
[2022-12-16 05:12:43] <yungpepega_> Unmatched skill!
[2022-12-16 05:12:44] <Wwwwwildhero> average druid turn

[2022-12-16 05:14:42] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> you can turn his quest guff into a plague spreader
[2022-12-16 05:14:56] <DameNightmare> might be all spells though
[2022-12-16 05:15:44] <zantomun> that was a lot of minions
[2022-12-16 05:15:46] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> only plague spreaders

[2022-12-16 05:16:28] <%NewCristiako> 6
[2022-12-16 05:16:28] <+Benconroy> There’s always a moment of pause after the first plague turn
[2022-12-16 05:16:40] <amurotensei> they really need to make it so that it shows what you changed that doesnt make any sense
[2022-12-16 05:16:51] <galacticlobster> I  just realized if you trigger a normal plague spreader on a golden card does the golden get overridden?

[2022-12-16 05:21:39] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> Yogg will sort it out
[2022-12-16 05:21:42] <DameNightmare> he must not have minions now
[2022-12-16 05:21:46] <LuckySalmon777> yogg ends it
[2022-12-16 05:21:48] <DameNightmare> or he would have killed umbra

[2022-12-16 05:38:06] <%davidmcg> wish they had a replay feature where you could spectate your opponent from the last match
[2022-12-16 05:38:06] <Wwwwwildhero> this is actually quite strong
[2022-12-16 05:38:10] <%+dumbgamerboy> mine rogue vs 40 health decks just seems like a terrible time
[2022-12-16 05:38:17] <Wwwwwildhero> destroys combo and control
[2022-12-16 05:38:24] <tm_war> gave deathrattle rogue some new deathrattles
[2022-12-16 05:38:25] <mipoko> plaguespreader ensures that all players have the same amount of enjoyment out of the game as everyone else (none)
[2022-12-16 05:38:31] <%Trompell0> dane should they unban and unnerf everything in wild?
[2022-12-16 05:39:04] <mipoko> now that plaguespreader is here how can you lose

[2022-12-16 05:39:07] <Wwwwwildhero> they need to unnerf all the cards simultaneously
[2022-12-16 05:39:18] <Wwwwwildhero> if every card is good they cancel each other out
[2022-12-16 05:39:20] <planetfunk64> @Trompell0 WutFace WutFace
[2022-12-16 05:39:59] <%+dumbgamerboy> to this day I don't know why demon seed was ever banned in wild, you could just kill it with any aggressive deck
[2022-12-16 05:40:47] <DadsBrothersCousin> really uncool that we have to wait 2 years to use a card because of an oversight. should be a high priority thing
[2022-12-16 05:40:56] <mipoko> with the 40 health max it might be a little harder now @dumbgamerboy
[2022-12-16 05:41:35] <Wwwwwildhero> demon seed could come back I think the standard nerfs did enough ngl
[2022-12-16 05:42:06] <+Benconroy> This hand is not very good
[2022-12-16 05:42:32] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> Naga Sea Witch was nerfed in wild

[2022-12-16 05:46:58] <%+Syntax3rr0rs> then chase each other around the room

[2022-12-16 06:00:51] <oskicon> why didn't he play the gain 2 mana last turn then though?
