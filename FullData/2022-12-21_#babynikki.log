[2022-12-21 16:20:53] <%+Iucentgg> @powerbats I think the best individual players come from EMEA and APAC North, YukaF, Cleave, Tyler, Ras etc etc, I don‚Äôt think anyone in NA can compare mechanically
[2022-12-21 16:20:55] <Inflingo> me have no apex friends  and too insecure to use my mic in games

[2022-12-21 16:22:31] <%+Iucentgg> @powerbats I genuinely think NA will have an extremely tough time of things heading into LAN, they simply don‚Äôt play against the comps APACN and EMEA

[2022-12-21 16:22:46] <%Powerbats> @Iucentgg You'd have to break that down by role/input I.E. MNK or Roller. I think each region has S tier mechanical players. Same for IGL's and champion play. I mean look at Twitch rivals with Sweet and Hal. They absolutely destroyed. I'd lvoe to see other regions have that.

[2022-12-21 16:24:40] <%Powerbats> I'd love to see Rivals but with all regions interspersed so NA could get mixed in with Apac. Even rotating regions and players
