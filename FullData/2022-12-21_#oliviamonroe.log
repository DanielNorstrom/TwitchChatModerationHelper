[2022-12-21 16:27:02] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Nah, pokemon fandom is kinda elitist, and theres an issue around not knowing certain mechanics

[2022-12-21 16:33:05] <%ArcReaper_21> Baldur's Gate is actually DnD universe

[2022-12-21 16:33:13] <!%Catbag> yeah you'd need to play a videogame based on D&D so the game acts as the DM
[2022-12-21 16:33:14] <zeunknown> Yeah you can do solo D&D. You just need a DM to take you under their wing. It very much is a thing
[2022-12-21 16:33:16] <%+JayBusch> That’s Baldur’s Gate, or some of the other CRPGs.
[2022-12-21 16:33:21] <%Furudehan> Plenty of pc games like that.
[2022-12-21 16:33:23] <%+PedroYuuhi> 1on1 DnD is pretty common

[2022-12-21 16:33:34] <Redamaford> You could also play stuff like Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights.

[2022-12-21 16:45:14] <%+JayBusch> Oh KEKW I have everything in G column
[2022-12-21 16:45:25] <%RabidBeefalo> $5-$10 for most LoL skins , up to $35
[2022-12-21 16:45:26] <+PumpkinPieman> They're priced like that because people will pay too much for them.
[2022-12-21 16:45:27] <steelgolem9> you can't have 2+ rgb AND no rgb
[2022-12-21 16:45:30] <%+PedroYuuhi> My brother owns a N64, not me
[2022-12-21 16:45:34] <%ArcReaper_21> what if you HAD and N64, but no longer?
[2022-12-21 16:45:34] <Seamoni> I don't have center square.  I watch Oli, but am not cool.
[2022-12-21 16:45:36] <@%owlishnick> I bought Fortnite skins so my nephews would stop bullying me about being a default
[2022-12-21 16:45:37] <+turokfireseed91203> I got 2 N64s, with expansion paks
[2022-12-21 16:45:39] <!%Catbag> This is the most fun data harvesting Olivia has ever done on chat
[2022-12-21 16:45:42] <%Sotetsu> You have mirrors all over your house.
[2022-12-21 16:45:43] <!%AirahsELL> we honestly dont know how much they really cost since most of these games use a fun money system to trick you into spending more money
[2022-12-21 16:45:43] <+AdonisThuul> I am only missing one
[2022-12-21 16:45:47] <%PigWithoutProtection> yes, several
[2022-12-21 16:45:48] <%+PedroYuuhi> Basically any indie game on steam
[2022-12-21 16:45:49] <%Furudehan> Have you kickstarted a game?

[2022-12-21 16:47:46] <!%AirahsELL> yall throw too much money around, im insanely picky about what games i get and usually wait until theyre all on sale.

[2022-12-21 16:48:23] <%rempac15> that's a large backlog there

[2022-12-21 16:48:43] <%Hentaiwatcher_> about 1100 here
[2022-12-21 16:48:45] <sleepy_moohnie> i got a bunch of VNs on itch io
[2022-12-21 16:48:50] <%JoesGuy> Oh, then billions
[2022-12-21 16:48:55] <%SaintanickClause> I even got stuff on xbox and I havent had one in years RaccAttack

[2022-12-21 16:49:00] <SkyPoppp> Oh damn all consoles
[2022-12-21 16:49:01] <%ArcReaper_21> Does  RPG dressing up for DnD game count as cosplaying?
[2022-12-21 16:49:01] <Seamoni> I am!
[2022-12-21 16:49:02] <%Hentaiwatcher_> me!
[2022-12-21 16:49:03] <%Lillowh> Easily 4 digits
[2022-12-21 16:49:06] <%+PedroYuuhi> Not yet
[2022-12-21 16:49:07] <steelgolem9> oh for sure in 1000+ club
[2022-12-21 16:49:08] <!%Catbag> that would bump me into Quad Club
[2022-12-21 16:49:08] <+HighAnxietyMedia> I literally collect retro games so I am well past quad club
[2022-12-21 16:49:13] <!%AirahsELL> no lol
[2022-12-21 16:49:13] <%$ashigaru> Well....I *sort of* have bingo depending on how you define "live gaming event."
[2022-12-21 16:49:13] <sleepy_moohnie> i have no idea
[2022-12-21 16:49:13] <enixtm> some boomers have cds too :D
[2022-12-21 16:49:14] <%Furudehan> I don't think I had hundreds of console games.
[2022-12-21 16:49:15] <FakeKraid> Hmmm
[2022-12-21 16:49:15] <SkyPoppp> Easy 4 digits yea
[2022-12-21 16:49:17] <%+JayBusch> Nah, I’d probably be up to like 500-600
[2022-12-21 16:49:18] <%PigWithoutProtection> OH WAIT haha I have exactly 100 games on Steam
[2022-12-21 16:49:24] <%Hentaiwatcher_> all consoles? I'd say probably 2500+
[2022-12-21 16:49:24] <Redamaford> If we included itch I MIGHT be quad, due to the fact they sometimes dump really really large piles of games for almost nothing.
[2022-12-21 16:49:25] <TheChrisWit> If all consoles, definitely at 1k
[2022-12-21 16:49:25] <%$moogimoogins> olivia50Wave
[2022-12-21 16:49:29] <TheChrisWit> Since nes
[2022-12-21 16:49:31] <%+PedroYuuhi> I have a lot of cardridges
[2022-12-21 16:49:33] <FakeKraid> I'd have to look but I don't think so
[2022-12-21 16:49:34] <%Tylphen> i STILL have my boxed edition of Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion
[2022-12-21 16:49:34] <$nive_30si> i got 16/25 and somehow no bingo
[2022-12-21 16:49:38] <MagikBased> wait what about our 5 digiters?
[2022-12-21 16:49:44] <!%Catbag> based brothers
[2022-12-21 16:49:44] <%TalkingObject> Quads?
[2022-12-21 16:49:46] <$ArtificerJoni> I'm pretty sure I'm Quad if all PC and Console stuff is counted.
[2022-12-21 16:49:47] <%Sotetsu> I'm probably around 600 with everything.
[2022-12-21 16:49:50] <Edibleghost> I hear Chad is packing a FAT steam library
[2022-12-21 16:49:51] <%+JayBusch> I’m picky about games I buy

[2022-12-21 16:49:53] <GuyMcGuy> owo whats this bingo
[2022-12-21 16:49:58] <@%Athagorn> Is that even possible?!
[2022-12-21 16:49:59] <FakeKraid> My collection isn't huge but it's extremely premium
[2022-12-21 16:50:05] <%PigWithoutProtection> how many games does Steam have?
[2022-12-21 16:50:06] <%Sotetsu> Please no one raise your hand olivia50Shock
[2022-12-21 16:50:08] <%+PedroYuuhi> People with 5 digits will die before they play everything
[2022-12-21 16:50:10] <%Hentaiwatcher_> 5 digits is crazy cvnkaHUHHK
[2022-12-21 16:50:18] <%Furudehan> No idea.

[2022-12-21 16:50:19] <%rempac15> it's very possible but that's still insane
[2022-12-21 16:50:20] <!%AirahsELL> like millions
[2022-12-21 16:50:22] <GuyMcGuy> id guess steam has like a million games
[2022-12-21 16:50:26] <Temporal_Paradox> maybe if you count things like emulators. you can add games to steam manually
[2022-12-21 16:50:26] <%+JayBusch> Steam has a crapload of games
[2022-12-21 16:50:31] <TheChrisWit> 5 digits for peeps who have a digital library
[2022-12-21 16:50:34] <!%AirahsELL> literally anyone can put games on steam now
[2022-12-21 16:50:35] <SkyPoppp> 5 digits is a straight up library
[2022-12-21 16:50:35] <Vore> There's only a few tens of thousands I believe
[2022-12-21 16:50:36] <Edibleghost> i could see people that archive stuff to have 5 digits
[2022-12-21 16:50:36] <%MayShip> i hope you like every genre because boy that sounds like something else

[2022-12-21 16:53:25] <%Hentaiwatcher_> im still happy with them, but a lot really need to think hard on what they offer and what is achieveable,
[2022-12-21 16:53:28] <@%owlishnick> Shovel Knight was good, Yooka Laylee was not

[2022-12-21 16:53:45] <Edibleghost> the enron of our time
[2022-12-21 16:53:46] <%Hentaiwatcher_> also   kickstarter is a donation,   not an assured cost of trade,  so it's understandable if things change
[2022-12-21 16:53:52] <%rempac15> KEKW
[2022-12-21 16:53:52] <!%AirahsELL> difference is "buying it after the kickstarter is done and the game launched"
[2022-12-21 16:53:53] <%Sotetsu> I was happy with a few of them. FTL game and the Changeling: The Dreaming book. But I was disappointed by more, so I stopped supporting them.
[2022-12-21 16:53:53] <%ArcReaper_21> No regrets on the ones I've done so far. Only done it for Owlcat CRPG games so far.
[2022-12-21 16:53:54] <%+PedroYuuhi> People who kickstart Undertale had a banger

[2022-12-21 16:54:24] <%Hentaiwatcher_> people dont always understand it's a donation to fund and support,  it's not an actual point of sale transaction
[2022-12-21 16:54:25] <Edibleghost> it's sunk cost fallacy and plenty of people fall into it
[2022-12-21 16:54:27] <%rempac15> it's better to regret things you've done than regret things you didn't do
[2022-12-21 16:54:29] <notraven__> i WILL call them stupid
[2022-12-21 16:54:36] <%+PedroYuuhi> They aren't stupid just because they got scammed

[2022-12-21 17:22:47] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Your delivery of an otome game would be great and I'm here for it
[2022-12-21 17:22:48] <PurpleGoetia> I’m good without otome
[2022-12-21 17:22:48] <%rempac15> if the story is good and has plenty of bad ends
[2022-12-21 17:22:48] <+PumpkinPieman> No?

[2022-12-21 17:22:52] <!%AirahsELL> Diabolik Lovers is on Switch I think
[2022-12-21 17:22:58] <PurpleGoetia> It’s dating sim ish
[2022-12-21 17:23:02] <TyrantSlime> A lot of VNs have some sort of trauma going on
[2022-12-21 17:23:02] <%SaintanickClause> Monster prom should count as an otome game RaccAttack
[2022-12-21 17:23:04] <%Sotetsu> Is that a harem dating game?
[2022-12-21 17:23:06] <ToryGenji> never played an otome before but will try to play one someday

[2022-12-21 17:23:17] <%+PedroYuuhi> It's like Dream Daddy
[2022-12-21 17:23:19] <!%AirahsELL> its a dating sim for girls with pretty boys. thats the only real difference
[2022-12-21 17:23:21] <FakeKraid> Speak for yourself Olivia I'm a lesbian erosCry
[2022-12-21 17:23:22] <%+JayBusch> Hatoful Boyfriend
[2022-12-21 17:23:25] <TheChrisWit> Dream daddy yes!!!
[2022-12-21 17:23:27] <Edibleghost> Women are already catered to too much in the games market
[2022-12-21 17:23:28] <%$moogimoogins> we can date the ikemen olivia50Pika
[2022-12-21 17:23:30] <Gdammit> OOOH is it like the KFC game?
[2022-12-21 17:23:38] <%$JacoK7> An otome game with Oli's commentary would turn into a comedy skit LUL

[2022-12-21 17:23:56] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> ive watched the dead by daylight otome gameplay LUL
[2022-12-21 17:23:57] <Redamaford> Brain crashed, please reboot
[2022-12-21 17:24:00] <TyrantSlime> Katawa Shoujo is a pretty famous one
[2022-12-21 17:24:02] <Temporal_Paradox> did you say Jojo?
[2022-12-21 17:24:02] <%$moogimoogins> olivia50Load
[2022-12-21 17:24:02] <$Kusanagi2k5> Why does that sound familiar
[2022-12-21 17:24:04] <Edibleghost> it's good but it's got H scenes
[2022-12-21 17:24:06] <FakeKraid> That game is... rough
[2022-12-21 17:24:06] <%$JacoK7> oh, I remember that one
[2022-12-21 17:24:06] <%MayShip> i love visual novels, i'd watch

[2022-12-21 17:24:09] <!%Catbag> ONLY if you date Lily
[2022-12-21 17:24:09] <%+JayBusch> That’s a pretty intense one
[2022-12-21 17:24:12] <%+PedroYuuhi> Katawa has +18
[2022-12-21 17:24:14] <%SaintanickClause> katawa demacy??? KappaClaus
[2022-12-21 17:24:15] <%Sotetsu> Katawa Shoujo is fun, but make sure the naughty is turned off.
[2022-12-21 17:24:16] <FakeKraid> YOU CAN TURN THE H SCENES OFF
[2022-12-21 17:24:17] <%Hentaiwatcher_> you can play it without the 18 content
[2022-12-21 17:24:17] <%+Novibear> not safe
[2022-12-21 17:24:20] <GuyMcGuy> otome fantasy stories are a girl that whoops winds up being friends with the royal prince, the captain of the guards, AND the hawt hunter guy from the forest SeemsGood
[2022-12-21 17:24:21] <!%AirahsELL> its a weird one, all the heroines have physical disabilities. there is a clean version though
[2022-12-21 17:24:25] <%Hentaiwatcher_> the story is pretty deep
[2022-12-21 17:24:25] <FakeKraid> IN THE MENU, IT'S STREAM SAFE
[2022-12-21 17:24:26] <%Furudehan> You can.
[2022-12-21 17:24:28] <Redamaford> You can turn off the naughty to a certain degree.
[2022-12-21 17:24:29] <Vore> Katawa Shojo uses fruits for naughty scenes by default
[2022-12-21 17:24:35] <%$JacoK7> you can disable the naughty parts
[2022-12-21 17:24:39] <$ArtificerJoni> You can censor the H scenes in Katawa Shoujo
[2022-12-21 17:24:39] <TheChrisWit> The characters I honestly love
[2022-12-21 17:24:41] <$Kusanagi2k5> @airahsell oh THATS why I remember it
[2022-12-21 17:24:44] <%Furudehan> Some of us were recommending it.
[2022-12-21 17:24:45] <Redamaford> Also it's all about Ableisim, and I'm not sure if you know much about that.
[2022-12-21 17:24:49] <Temporal_Paradox> oh shojo not Jojo coquiSnicker
[2022-12-21 17:24:49] <FakeKraid> But yeah, katawa shoujo is not light-hearted at all

[2022-12-21 17:24:54] <%coco19067> LUL That was a journey!
[2022-12-21 17:24:54] <+turokfireseed91203> I have returned after my internet got corrupted by Mephisto
[2022-12-21 17:24:56] <!%AirahsELL> Katawa Shoujo lets you disable the naughty scenes and honestly the game  doesnt need it at all.
[2022-12-21 17:24:57] <Redamaford> Though it is a topic important to me
[2022-12-21 17:24:57] <%$SigWtf> DDLC is amazing
[2022-12-21 17:25:12] <FakeKraid> That said, it is pretty good, it treats the disability issues with a surprising amount of sensitivity
[2022-12-21 17:25:12] <%+PedroYuuhi> Dream Daddy is the best dating sim
[2022-12-21 17:25:13] <%Hentaiwatcher_> it is very interesting though, worth a look
[2022-12-21 17:25:15] <FTWOBR2000> What's a mobile console?
[2022-12-21 17:25:18] <GuyMcGuy> also im reminded of Hatoful Boyfriend, the bird dating game
[2022-12-21 17:25:24] <!%Catbag> how wacky

[2022-12-21 17:25:29] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Wacky in what kinda way
[2022-12-21 17:25:29] <%Hentaiwatcher_> yes it handles it well
[2022-12-21 17:25:39] <%SaintanickClause> koriHug noble redama
[2022-12-21 17:25:40] <%+Novibear> OH BOYFRIEND DUNGEON is liek hades meets a light dating sim where you smooch weapon people
[2022-12-21 17:25:43] <!%AirahsELL> its not about ableism. the protag has a heart condition and every girl has some physical disability, like blind/mute/lacking limbs/burn scarring
[2022-12-21 17:25:43] <FTWOBR2000> I genuinely thought of the Ouya when I saw the phrase "mobile console"
[2022-12-21 17:25:45] <FakeKraid> It might be one of the best portayals of physical disability in games tbh
[2022-12-21 17:25:46] <$Kusanagi2k5> Is the KFC Dating game safe for work/streaming?
[2022-12-21 17:25:50] <TheChrisWit> What about kfc colonel sanders dating sun?
[2022-12-21 17:25:51] <!%Catbag> Oh, funny
[2022-12-21 17:25:51] <FTWOBR2000> I assume you mean stuff like the Game Boy?
[2022-12-21 17:25:52] <Ryskan_> You could try etrian odyssey?
[2022-12-21 17:25:52] <chazbone8> perfect time for Olivia to get into Armor Core
[2022-12-21 17:25:53] <Redamaford> It supports disabled people, yeah, but it also touches on what Ableisim actually is.
[2022-12-21 17:25:57] <%Sotetsu> Psychonauts is funny.
[2022-12-21 17:25:58] <%GinTamashiVT> Henry Stickman?
[2022-12-21 17:25:58] <+turokfireseed91203> Saint's Row is pretty funny

[2022-12-21 17:26:17] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Potatoman seeks tha troof. It's a game that completely suits your viube, though it can be beaten in about 20 minutes

[2022-12-21 17:26:18] <!%AirahsELL> Sucker For Love is a fun dating sim. you date Cthulhu

[2022-12-21 17:40:46] <%+JayBusch> Smite Demons harder, Oli. That’s what will fix us.
[2022-12-21 17:40:46] <Redamaford> So if you talk to cain and choose "Identify Items" he'll just ID everything you got for free.   You should do this, often.

[2022-12-21 17:43:01] <$StrikingWalrus> let's be honest, everyone liked helltaker for the art :)
[2022-12-21 17:43:03] <!%AirahsELL> helltaker is a fun sliding black puzzle game

[2022-12-21 17:43:29] <Temporal_Paradox> helltaker has a sale on nail polish
[2022-12-21 17:43:32] <forsmano> why not equip the ring
[2022-12-21 17:43:37] <!%Fuzzgotgames> The benefit of getting items identified is it increases their monetary value, and means you can sell them for more
[2022-12-21 17:43:43] <+turokfireseed91203> Do you think this inventory system is as fun as RE4's inventory system?
[2022-12-21 17:43:43] <sleepy_moohnie> helltaker had really boppin' music!

[2022-12-21 17:47:13] <!%Fuzzgotgames> The best experience ive had in this game is doing co-op with 7 other players. It scales the difficulty of the game, but it can be crazy fun

[2022-12-21 17:49:40] <ughdontmakemeregister> @PopsicleD2 It's olicore
[2022-12-21 17:49:42] <%+Burlackfoehacker> why do you have so many Mana potions?
[2022-12-21 17:49:42] <%+PedroYuuhi> Guys I'm scared what if she dies again

[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <TheChrisWit> There’s like 10 hardcore modes
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%rempac15> permanent death is painful
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <+Jintu> like Hardcore+? D:
[2022-12-21 17:50:00] <forsmano> I've certainly not beaten this game on hardcore
[2022-12-21 17:50:01] <%Furudehan> If it were hardcore she wouldn't still be playing lol
[2022-12-21 17:50:03] <%TalkingObject> Is Oli hardcore enough?
[2022-12-21 17:50:07] <ughdontmakemeregister> i'm scared
[2022-12-21 17:50:15] <PopsicleD2> U should play project diablo 2
[2022-12-21 17:50:26] <%TheShaffinator> diablo 2 has probably the most punishing permadeath in gamingg
[2022-12-21 17:50:28] <%+penguin_poggers_> no i was saving that
[2022-12-21 17:50:29] <marklarphd> Playing solo is harder than the way most Diablo 2 fans played it back in the day

[2022-12-21 17:51:14] <%Furudehan> Just replace your mana pots.

[2022-12-21 17:51:22] <!%AirahsELL> this potion system is so stupid
[2022-12-21 17:51:23] <%TheShaffinator> Project Diablo 2 is the a massive mod with live servers that work on the game as if development never finished, it's a better remaster than the remaster

[2022-12-21 18:36:32] <Redamaford> Yeah, so the idea is you want to block LoS and use choke points like doorways.

[2022-12-21 19:13:54] <!%AirahsELL> the only part where they're wrong is thinking tv was good long ago. tv was NEVER good, but its just easier to see how bad it is with all the on demand services letting you skip the junk.

[2022-12-21 21:57:33] <%Megaket> Diablo has a tendency to ask how your fear tastes, so I think he can only eat when people are scared, so he has to scare people so he can get dinner
