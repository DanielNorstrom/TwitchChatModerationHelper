You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops/inventory

[2023-01-04 15:52:17] <GirlandaConsole> so where do you think Moira plays the best? Next to Tank in the front, mid to back line or flank focused? I feel like I see a little bit of all it and its sooo situational
[2023-01-04 15:52:30] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @GirlandaConsole in their backline

[2023-01-04 15:53:27] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> go 30-1 as moira and call your team trash when you lose

[2023-01-04 15:53:35] <%+BigKingManatee> @girlandaconsole Throw a random damage orb because it'll bounce randomly and then into the backing to dps the way God intended it.
[2023-01-04 15:53:40] <elementking990> @girlandaconsole so far in the backline the enemy thinks you are on their team.
[2023-01-04 15:53:41] <%+itspey10> @xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx another daily idea

[2023-01-04 16:17:12] <%+porkchoppd> I think his heal needs to be reworked into damage based or something like that

[2023-01-04 16:17:22] <%$schubiez> @Emongg why not give players a chance to melee the hook???
[2023-01-04 16:17:27] <KoalafiedGamerGuys> fix the hook hitbox a bit as a start
[2023-01-04 16:17:29] <steppbroimstuckk> Any comp games today?
[2023-01-04 16:17:32] <%+thelastp0rg> Orisa is just as bad now :(
[2023-01-04 16:17:38] <+okluminosity> Genji is the worst to play against
[2023-01-04 16:17:39] <mrwang30> If you have a ramattra or sigma map how do you decide between the two of them?
[2023-01-04 16:17:47] <%themegabird> Do you feel that eventually there might be too many heroes that the game becomes too unbalanced?
[2023-01-04 16:17:54] <zoeyfemscoutofdarkdeep> I don't get the ult
[2023-01-04 16:17:54] <konquestz> Im gold 1 support, mainly playing kiriko, usually doing pretty well, some games I feel like my dps are out of position and get sniped a lot and a lot of doomfists over extending and dying, wondering if you have any advice on how to overcome these challenges

[2023-01-04 16:18:29] <+star___bright> @themegabird I don't think hero QUANTITY is going to be a problem. Quality for sure, and I still really really hate their new monetization model which does have direct impact on game balance imo
[2023-01-04 16:18:29] <sinistersinns> Is Winston a good pick against Orisa to drive their supports?

[2023-01-04 16:19:09] <konquestz> Just realised its a pretty loaded question while he is in game, any of you got any advice? Down Below Im gold 1 support, mainly playing kiriko, usually doing pretty well, some games I feel like my dps are out of position and get sniped a lot and a lot of doomfists over extending and dying, wondering if you have any advice on how to overcome these challenges
[2023-01-04 16:19:14] <+okluminosity> Genji deflect needs to be more skill based then just blocking everything
[2023-01-04 16:19:22] <IllusiveShot0N8> kriko I think is a bigger problem then hog her cleanse is making tanks op or weak as heck. aka junkerqueen
[2023-01-04 16:19:31] <+azashiro_> i feel like junkers axe take too much to swing
[2023-01-04 16:19:33] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz I'm the same rank, same role, so I totally understand this. The best thing you can do is do your job exceptionally well. If you're playing Kiriko, get an off-angle pick and TP back to your teammate, especially if they're also off-angling
[2023-01-04 16:19:45] <quackbob12345678> orisa is a weird tank to me now i just dont know how to play her and queen very well and i will never touch zyra shes my least favorite tank in the game sorry emongg lol
[2023-01-04 16:19:52] <king_bergkamp> ngl I feel like if hog reworks puts him out of the meta ramattra could dominate
[2023-01-04 16:19:55] <%$schubiez> @okluminosity exactly, im suggesting when hog cast his hook, you can melee the hook to cancel it

[2023-01-04 16:20:06] <+Necrosythe> @konquestz you would have to dink people yourself. while still putting out good healing. but I'd suggest going with a healer who has an easier time fragging themselves. like zen moira bap
[2023-01-04 16:20:16] <+Riggsy88> emongg, what graphics card do you use?
[2023-01-04 16:20:19] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz you can't control what your teammates do, only what you can.
[2023-01-04 16:20:27] <+Necrosythe> a lot of kirikos strength is in her ult which isn't going to get the same value in low elo

[2023-01-04 16:21:06] <quackbob12345678> orisa is a weird tank to me now i just dont know how to play her and queen very well and i will never touch zyra shes my least favorite tank in the game sorry @Emongg lol another thing do u think they will bring back the mythic skins in the shop?
[2023-01-04 16:21:12] <%N30NxL1T3x> good nifes
[2023-01-04 16:21:13] <mrwang30> Emong rocking a 4090?
[2023-01-04 16:21:13] <+okluminosity> @schubiez yeah i can see something like that. I just think some characters mitigation is too much
[2023-01-04 16:21:16] <evansa1t> w
[2023-01-04 16:21:17] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> your healers popped off there
[2023-01-04 16:21:17] <youngchedd5> So because of MMR are you essentially in qp with GM+ @emongg ?
[2023-01-04 16:21:19] <+star___bright> @themegabird I 100% agree which is why I haven't really been playing the game much. The monetization is seriously a dealbreaker imo and I really wish that the heroes weren't a part of it
[2023-01-04 16:21:27] <cyberahmad1> how about rank system now?
[2023-01-04 16:21:28] <IllusiveShot0N8> Supports

[2023-01-04 16:21:32] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz Try looking at your positioning, your deaths, figure out why you're dying. If you're following teammates into bad positions, that's your fault for following them, for example.

[2023-01-04 16:22:19] <ducksurgeon_> why not JQ in ranked?
[2023-01-04 16:22:24] <konquestz> Im usually ending the game between 0-3 deaths, my survivability is pretty good, but ive been screamed at for not outhealing an ashe headshot etc. Just doesnt make much sense to me
[2023-01-04 16:22:25] <jackstoningt0n> Wrecking ball game?
[2023-01-04 16:22:28] <Flipnoutmon> Carrying with Kiriko in low elo is quite easy. Focus on keeping your team alive over picks and damage. Low elo players will misplace and die in the time you look to do damage

[2023-01-04 16:22:53] <Flipnoutmon> Ana is great at carrying low elo games. Many tanks don’t know how to save cooldowns for a well timed anti nade
[2023-01-04 16:22:56] <jackstoningt0n> I was good with pathfind in Apex and thought it would transfer to Ball. It did not
[2023-01-04 16:23:03] <+okluminosity> Like sigma has an unlimited shield its so boring to play against
[2023-01-04 16:23:05] <%themegabird> @star___bright I mean I play but just QP I feel comp is just too much of a crap shoot sometimes at lower ranks. I agree they should've just made people pay 20 bucks for Overwatch 2 and everyone gets the heroes and then you can add in a cosmetic battle pass if people want that
[2023-01-04 16:23:09] <Flipnoutmon> Wait on anti till Suzu has been used. Easy team fight

[2023-01-04 16:23:18] <IllusiveShot0N8> what would you change to make comp fun?
[2023-01-04 16:23:27] <+star___bright> What's the current meta in high tier comp? As a tl;dr for me
[2023-01-04 16:23:33] <%+hoopla369> I was bronze one then ranked up to silver 5

[2023-01-04 16:25:02] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz my best way of dealing with tilt is just cutting it off entirely. I've been playing a QP between every comp match, or going to an arcade or something that doesn't matter.

[2023-01-04 16:27:54] <konquestz> @konquestz yeah control + shift + c is a shortcut if you wanted that tidbit. I usually do if people are way too mean, but I am finding myself some games having really high healing, low deaths, high elims/assits and (ok damage for a support) and them some games getting absolutely bodies, and its usually when im close to getting my new rank
[2023-01-04 16:28:02] <finsheep09> @elementking990 mine says there event ended  :(

[2023-01-04 16:28:59] <elementking990> If just starting there isn't enough time to get the drop anyway.
[2023-01-04 16:29:06] <finsheep09> @elementking990 i was 10% away 4 the skin
[2023-01-04 16:29:09] <quackbob12345678> 20% left for the skin

[2023-01-04 16:29:43] <elementking990> @finsheep09 oh damn I dunno then. maybe try the classic restart.
[2023-01-04 16:29:45] <+vaniitas4> @mrwang30 im ok with even if they don't give him movement, just big jumb with 10 sec cooldown is enough : )
[2023-01-04 16:29:47] <konquestz> at a 60%ish win rate
[2023-01-04 16:30:07] <quackbob12345678> i never have been able to complete the battle pass will the skins come back do u think @Emongg
[2023-01-04 16:30:09] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> just noticed this excellent name the torb has
[2023-01-04 16:30:23] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz yep! that's the ranked crapshoot. Gotta approach it with grace, and just look at yourself, it's the only thing you can change. Maybe you're focusing too much on healing and should develop your kunai skills to turn an advantage. watch back your vods critically and think about what you can do differently, even if it's not what you think you "should" do
[2023-01-04 16:30:25] <mrwang30> He'd be like a rein but with guns instead of hammer

[2023-01-04 16:31:48] <LoremasterMarthan> Bout to get that gold medal in the healing category!

[2023-01-04 16:32:30] <+star___bright> How did they buff hog this time?
[2023-01-04 16:32:35] <DzilOne> lowest hp tank with temp hp for some reason and not armor or shields PepeLaugh meanwhile ramatra can pop +200 armor, ult, +200 armor back to back 3 times in a row

[2023-01-04 16:32:50] <PatagonianIris> @vaniitas4 I honestly have had so much irl poop going on, there’s been no time. ._. Only saw it today and missed it back in OG OW because of Uni crap.
[2023-01-04 16:33:02] <+sussyloba> is submitting vods closed rn because every time I go into it says done looking go to general
[2023-01-04 16:33:03] <tim_no_slim> JQ doesnt need a nerf its just hog, JQ is balanced, in fact her ult might need a nerf if anything
[2023-01-04 16:33:06] <Geagiteerd> do you think the patch is tomorrow?
[2023-01-04 16:33:26] <lilextra66> Roadhog needs to be nerfed
[2023-01-04 16:33:27] <konquestz> Is Awkward a good person to learn support from?
[2023-01-04 16:33:28] <+Necrosythe> apparently. I don't really think it makes sense to have so many other one shots in the game that require less resources than hook but removes hog but idk
[2023-01-04 16:33:29] <quackbob12345678> emongg to me imo if they get rid of the one shot wouldnt hogs just find another way to do it like in ow2
[2023-01-04 16:33:30] <mrwang30> Increased hook range, more dmg, heals more from ability
[2023-01-04 16:33:34] <ldlc_matoux> wsh
[2023-01-04 16:33:36] <elementking990> JQ needs a buff. Her ult gets cleansed by Kiriko so easily.
[2023-01-04 16:33:37] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-04 16:33:41] <%sinistersinns> I came from YouTube, you, Flats, Seagull, and Jay3 brought me to Twitch. First time watching a live comp game, let’s go!
[2023-01-04 16:33:41] <m_lkyys> Ads :(
[2023-01-04 16:33:41] <+vaniitas4> @PatagonianIris ye I also heard about it lately after the kiriko skin, I regret that a lot since I main her
[2023-01-04 16:33:47] <+Necrosythe> @konquestz A lot of people stand by watching him. ML7 is good too
[2023-01-04 16:34:01] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz also consider suzu usage - when do you wish you had it but it's on cd? is that a consistent issue? are you using it on the ana sleep but not saving it for nade? that kind of thing. there's a lot to think about every fight, and each game is different. there aren't hard and fast rules for improvement or else everyone would be ranking up, right? make your goal not winning, but improving.
[2023-01-04 16:34:10] <%zonar_ow> it's busan, so it will be a good one

[2023-01-04 16:34:47] <quackbob12345678> imo if they get rid of the one shot wouldnt hogs just find another way to do it like in ow1

[2023-01-04 16:34:50] <lbj3333> besides taking space what else should a tank do?
[2023-01-04 16:35:13] <TitusMythril> he's a hog main and he's playing orisa so blizzard doesn't nerf hog
[2023-01-04 16:35:14] <+star___bright> Hog is either garbage when he can't oneshot or brutally OP when he can. There is no middle ground - there never was even in OW1.
[2023-01-04 16:35:20] <4PointedEmerald> Same here, first stream I’ve caught coming from YT! do me proud and I’ll prime 🙏🙏 lmao

[2023-01-04 16:35:25] <jackstoningt0n> Crazy how well Ram is designed. The release was a little underwhelming but once he got his buff he was meta
[2023-01-04 16:35:26] <%+zelorus_1> They should get rid of all oneshot abilities or combos, now they have 5v5
[2023-01-04 16:35:35] <elementking990> I think the hook can be okay because at least it's some skill hitting it. The self heal is obnoxious though imo.
[2023-01-04 16:35:41] <mrwang30> Glad they buffed ram
[2023-01-04 16:35:42] <PatagonianIris> @vaniitas4 I mean unless it glitches out, I think I’m not gunna get it. Oh well. I have a nice enough D.va skin, is just my og collector brain being fuzzy like that. Still waiting on Kiriko, Sojurn and JQ OWL skins from the grand finals. ._.
[2023-01-04 16:35:43] <Nia_best_girl> YAY
[2023-01-04 16:35:47] <+star___bright> @zelorus_1 By this logic Widow shouldn't exist.
[2023-01-04 16:35:49] <Geagiteerd> aint no way man said the hook takes skill
[2023-01-04 16:35:59] <konquestz> @konquestz I do definitely sometimes use it when I shouldn't, a lot of the time I use it to save the tank when they are around 5% health so I can top them up, just to get naded afterward, so I lose either way in that situation (dead tank, or naded tank) Also I usually do my worst in games with a decent Junkrat because I find it hard to navigate around the randomness of his damage
[2023-01-04 16:36:00] <+MoriartyUK> Have you seen an uptick in twitch people since becoming a famous Tok star, Emongg?
[2023-01-04 16:36:24] <elementking990> Compared to pressing a button to heal half HP it's 'some' skill yeah
[2023-01-04 16:36:25] <nessrh> They should give him a third ability
[2023-01-04 16:36:25] <Geagiteerd> also yes, delete widow
[2023-01-04 16:36:26] <4PointedEmerald> Tok Moria star*

[2023-01-04 16:36:43] <%+zelorus_1> @star___bright exactly, and those rnd hit arrows from hanzo spamming a choke point, shield meta is over, less to get protection, even widow is outdated now, it feels hilarious

[2023-01-04 16:37:01] <+vaniitas4> I ended up in low-plat lobby as tank after 3 games and my entire tank experience is just watching Emongg. and im still silver where im trying to cimg af on support broyouClown
[2023-01-04 16:37:07] <elementking990> Hog overall requires very little skill at the moment so I don't like to play him because it feels like there's no room for improvement.
[2023-01-04 16:37:11] <quackbob12345678> i wish i could be as good as u at this game i want to try out for my collage overwatch team but i dont feel good enough with my 3 characters
[2023-01-04 16:37:25] <mrwang30> popping off
[2023-01-04 16:37:28] <declaring_intent> replace hog hook with a barrel. let him toss our barrel and dmg increases over time until he blows up barrel. ult causes knockback + dmg. Basically turn him into Gragas.
[2023-01-04 16:37:40] <+MoriartyUK> @quackbob12345678 Yo try out anyway, worse they can do is say no and it's a great experience.
[2023-01-04 16:37:45] <m_lkyys> @quackbob12345678 no hesitation, do it
[2023-01-04 16:38:04] <%+BobDoorbell> hello
[2023-01-04 16:38:04] <Labreris> They need to give Hog a whirlwind hook or a long ranged hook lash

[2023-01-04 16:38:16] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz 🤝 i am also a junkrat hater. in the case of the tank, it may be smarter to hold the suzu, let your tank die, and use the suzu to keep the rest of your team up and/or cleanse the nade on your squishies/self and maybe your DPS can turn the fight, and your tank might learn to play safer.

[2023-01-04 16:39:21] <%+bApplejax> orisa's kit is too fast with the cooldowns and hog's hook is too easy to hit
[2023-01-04 16:39:23] <+star___bright> New Orisa has been a much more interesting design but still has counterplay problems

[2023-01-04 16:39:53] <%zonar_ow> i'm always the first to bash blizz's balance design and philosophy, but their rework of orisa was great, so i have faith they can do it with hog
[2023-01-04 16:40:00] <%+BobDoorbell> @emongg do you think it's a flaw that Orisa's main survivability is based on her abilities?
[2023-01-04 16:40:03] <Labreris> I think the S tier tanks RN are Orisa and Hog imo
[2023-01-04 16:40:05] <jackstoningt0n> Dva or brigg has the biggest crit box
[2023-01-04 16:40:05] <lilextra66> @elementking990 Yep
[2023-01-04 16:40:10] <konquestz> @konquestz Yeah I do find myself focusing on keeping the tank up more, which i know I shouldn't,  but usually the dps are scattered so its hard to bounce between them, even with swift step, since there are so many snipers and a lot of burst damage, like in the situation of vs a good widow, I feel useless unless I go and try and kill her as Kiriko, but if they are good I usually take the L

[2023-01-04 16:40:17] <%+thelastp0rg> But Orisa makes all other tanks unplayable atm, needs higher cooldowns
[2023-01-04 16:40:21] <mayhxem> whats the best dps rn

[2023-01-04 16:42:19] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz well that partially depends on your support comp. if you have Kiriko Mercy, you'll want to focus on your tank and let your Mercy take care of the DPS. if you're on Kiriko Ana, your tank is ana's responsibility, go be an annoying mosquito in the enemy backline and toss some papers to your DPS. wall climb is also super underrated in gold. also the kunai do a stupid amount of hs damage, so you can poke at the widow from FAR and still get value, just peeking enough to spam them at head he

[2023-01-04 16:44:12] <konquestz> @konquestz I'll have to keep that in mind, I was so confident Id get to plat 5 once I hit gold 1, but now I feel like I have kind of plateaued. Is it just kind of luck depending on your team to a certain point?

[2023-01-04 16:45:45] <%Seishinz> @vaniitas4 You can hide your hitbox better
[2023-01-04 16:45:47] <konquestz> @konquestz Also do you know what the drops are for I am new to this stream
[2023-01-04 16:45:47] <elementking990> @vaniitas4 gives you better line of sight, easier to escape if you need to.
[2023-01-04 16:45:51] <quackbob12345678> emongg can u explain to me why rein is not meta becuase he has a shield
[2023-01-04 16:45:59] <m_lkyys> Widow just dominates with no shields. Plus no dive picks
[2023-01-04 16:46:11] <m_lkyys> Just can’t do anything tbh
[2023-01-04 16:46:14] <%+wisteria_rose> @vaniitas4 you have better line of sight on the enemy, easier for you to get picks than for them
[2023-01-04 16:46:18] <pokeydude3> I do love Widowmakers with their Phone number as their name
[2023-01-04 16:46:20] <+Truu_tv> @vaniitas4 Lookin up ins harder to aim at than looking down

[2023-01-04 16:46:34] <%$Roukov> high ground gives you more cover while taking away cover from others.

[2023-01-04 16:46:50] <%a_witcher> @vaniitas4 youre missing out on thousands of years of warfare ^^ but simply its harder to fight upwards than downwards ^^
[2023-01-04 16:46:51] <%stillarobyn> @konquestz Kinda feels that way. I've been on the slow climb, and IMO once you get to Gold 1, the games feel more balanced than lower gold games. If you're staying the same rank, that's probably you no longer fighting to get to where your MMR is.

[2023-01-04 16:56:13] <%+wisteria_rose> @star___bright this is a really good map, i prefer payload to push though
[2023-01-04 16:56:15] <+Sc4tO> lots of widow these days?
[2023-01-04 16:56:16] <%zonar_ow> 2nd is weird

[2023-01-04 16:56:52] <+star___bright> Love payload, both in OW and TF2. Turns out it's a good concept that translates well
[2023-01-04 16:56:57] <alvara_alvarez> heal diff
[2023-01-04 16:56:58] <quackbob12345678> i probley will use this dva skin even tho chrismas is over i like it so much
[2023-01-04 16:57:12] <+Necrosythe> @m_lkyys maybe with a hog nerf we can get more dive tanks to counter widow
[2023-01-04 16:57:17] <+izzied> widow shoots through shield?
[2023-01-04 16:57:26] <m_lkyys> @necrosythe I would love that

[2023-01-04 16:57:35] <poopingdabs> @emongg this map is just a bunch of left and right turns only
[2023-01-04 16:57:40] <+kendog_the_god> usually on attack is the worst
[2023-01-04 16:57:52] <%+wisteria_rose> @kendog_the_god totally agree - i prefer playing attack on payload, but this one i enjoy defence too!
[2023-01-04 16:57:59] <%Noeliosis> good morning friends SealArrive
[2023-01-04 16:57:59] <+star___bright> Hybrid is a hit and miss per-map tbh

[2023-01-04 16:58:19] <+Countryman117> shambali is tough to attack, especially 2nd point
[2023-01-04 16:58:21] <+BrownieTheGod> any tips on getting better as a widow?

[2023-01-04 16:59:25] <+Hii94> @zp6ke You shouldn't be telling the streamer what to do.
[2023-01-04 16:59:27] <+Goofballs_25> This map is so defense favored, don't think I've played a ranked match yet where either side made it to the end
[2023-01-04 16:59:30] <jackstoningt0n> What if sigma got a third shot to his primary

[2023-01-04 17:03:00] <%stillarobyn> @albeblessedaf I don't think he or the team have said a reason, but I doubt it. I believe, given it was start of the year, that it was just expiration of contract

[2023-01-04 17:42:53] <dragonaethere> @Djiinerate0 ???
[2023-01-04 17:42:59] <NoiseCrush> "to LOS" usually means to break line of sight, like if you're saying "LOS the soldier" it means get out of sight

[2023-01-04 17:43:07] <LightTwi> so oooonly way to counter her ult is to walk out of it or an ability since shields also dont work?

[2023-01-04 17:44:53] <+MoriartyUK> @urban_xgamer Basically if something is blocking your enemy from seeing you then they do not have "LoS" or line of sight. They can't see you.

[2023-01-04 17:49:10] <%stillarobyn> @Weslington I mean this is definitely an ongoing trend over the last year. Dependency on others to bring new information. I feel a lot of it has to do with social media like IG/TT that aren't text-based, and a lack of self-directed research skills in education
[2023-01-04 17:49:17] <%poogyboy> i can't wait to hold 3rd point
[2023-01-04 17:49:19] <+hangy> is it better to break shields or ignore shields?
[2023-01-04 17:49:21] <+funkyscat69> @funkyscat69 yes to all of that

[2023-01-04 17:49:37] <NoiseCrush> sigma was key to the double shield meta
[2023-01-04 17:49:41] <pushtape> @hangy (depends). and which shields
[2023-01-04 17:49:41] <nin_kirsuji> orisa sig
[2023-01-04 17:49:42] <ThePotatoJohn> LOS: An imaginary line of vision from the opponents point of view. If you are in that line, they can see you, if you are not in that line (out of LOS), you cant be seen / shot at
[2023-01-04 17:49:49] <BrinKKoo> oh ye double shields
[2023-01-04 17:49:49] <%marcsick1> Yes sigma was very meta
[2023-01-04 17:49:50] <%+wisteria_rose> @WabbitInvictus hes just memeing us - ignore him, we tend to :) emongSmug
[2023-01-04 17:49:50] <pushtape> @hangy theres no 1 answer to break shields or not

[2023-01-04 17:49:58] <%Culein_> why people saying "support"?? its healer, tiktok said that and tiktok never lies
[2023-01-04 17:50:04] <%+nothinggood27> I feel like support positioning can be harder at lower ranks cause you have to leave cover to get LOS of your team..
[2023-01-04 17:50:07] <WabbitInvictus> @wisteria_rose I will dismember anyone who tells me to heal

[2023-01-04 17:55:06] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> it takes me 5 minutes to build ult so that's a big strat
[2023-01-04 17:55:08] <WabbitInvictus> @tjepp38 The punch is an extra 30 damage with no loss because the balls regenerate in the time it takes to punch so you can fire again
[2023-01-04 17:55:08] <junkyard1131> i main sigma and hes the only one i have gold weapons for

[2023-01-04 17:55:32] <doopadelphia> @tjepp38 its just quicker/more conisistant close range.  you can also shoot - punch - shoot and lose no damage

[2023-01-04 17:55:48] <+DerKeksAlex> tunnel map
[2023-01-04 17:55:53] <WabbitInvictus> @pushtape Actually most heroes you shouldn't, as just shooting them does so much more damage because of the animation, but sigma doesn't suffer that penalty
[2023-01-04 17:56:03] <junkyard1131> dva sigma is good here in my opinion
[2023-01-04 17:56:08] <%+brominn> long narrow sightlines
[2023-01-04 17:56:10] <+citizendolan> Would you say its a good ramm map too? ive got like a 90% win rate on it for some reason at like mid-high plat.
[2023-01-04 17:56:14] <pushtape> @WabbitInvictus this is not true
[2023-01-04 17:56:20] <pushtape> not gonna argue tho
[2023-01-04 17:56:32] <jay3sdckitten> I want to play sigma but I find him too boring
[2023-01-04 17:56:36] <pushtape> moira punches are my favs lol
[2023-01-04 17:56:38] <pushtape> and hanzo

[2023-01-04 17:57:13] <ShanghaiKid81> is Havana a good Sigma map?
[2023-01-04 17:57:18] <WabbitInvictus> @pushtape Yuh it's great for finishing but not for killing. Genji can do 2 and a half shurikens in one punch animation, meaning he's doing 70 damage in the time it takes to do 30
[2023-01-04 17:57:18] <srvsxx> WAIT YOUR A STREAMER?!?

[2023-01-04 18:01:09] <%+tm_901> @rnowill your primary job is to create space for your team to play in, not to necessarily keep them alive

[2023-01-04 18:01:28] <WabbitInvictus> @rnowill Number one tank duty is to create space to enable your team, your duty isn't to protect them it's to enable them to get picks and continue healing you. You should intimidate the enemy with your size and how powerful you are compared to their non tanks.
[2023-01-04 18:01:33] <Xseleon> Mei and Sigma build ult so fast, wow

[2023-01-04 18:36:20] <%SpaceCircus_> moira PHYSICALLY has to CHOOOSE to dps or heal

[2023-01-04 18:36:28] <ChronoAura> With Moira, you need to damage to refill the heal meter, primarily. But DPS moira waste the potential refill moments by never using the heals.
[2023-01-04 18:36:29] <+arc_meco> Moira numbers big. mean good. numbers...mmmmm
[2023-01-04 18:36:41] <Obast> Kiriko/Lucio is best comp
[2023-01-04 18:36:42] <pushtape> i mean moira heal orbs arent that great value a lot of time in OW2 imo
[2023-01-04 18:36:47] <%iliketoeatpineapples> lucio has better poking damage potential than moira. moira releases that damage orb and you know... you know that you need to grit your teeth she will run out of heal  PepeLaugh

[2023-01-04 19:19:00] <vinofof> will they buff JQ
[2023-01-04 19:19:01] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> obviously not ethical enough to play 69 hours of hog this season :(

[2023-01-04 19:19:44] <+yourguyandrew> Buff sojourn
[2023-01-04 19:19:45] <Obast> they should just reduce Hogs incoming healer from outside sources when he uses his self healing.
[2023-01-04 19:19:48] <+JishDaGreeGree> @RhettOfBodom yea, who thought that was a good idea
[2023-01-04 19:19:56] <vinofof> lets hope they give doomfist his cooldowns back
[2023-01-04 19:20:01] <+Protoman20XX> He's a cool poke and block bot, but the character's kit hasn't been that engaging for me.
[2023-01-04 19:20:01] <%$schubiez> I don't think even the devs know how to play ramattra
[2023-01-04 19:20:02] <+aaymon86> Ult is good but gets countered by sleep or running away
[2023-01-04 19:20:04] <%+pdotLOL> i want JQ to be good so bad
[2023-01-04 19:20:06] <+Necrosythe> deff no nerf, maybe make the block something more useful and take away some of the power of the melee/ult
[2023-01-04 19:20:06] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @Obast or he doesn't receive heal for a duration once he uses his self heal
[2023-01-04 19:20:07] <NoTthE_1> nice
[2023-01-04 19:20:07] <+moistserviette> thats tru just running away makes his ult usless

[2023-01-04 19:20:09] <cdherrington> Ram ult is OP right now in lower tiers
[2023-01-04 19:20:09] <+pinkiepantsu> before we think about nerfing ramattra lets look at those who can actually run/ruin games

[2023-01-04 19:20:35] <+NovaGamr> Man, I hope they buff soujorn, she’s such an underplayed character
[2023-01-04 19:20:37] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @pinkiepantsu yeah nerfing genji is the top priority
[2023-01-04 19:20:40] <udontknowme522> 3pm est or pst for skin?
[2023-01-04 19:20:47] <Obast> every new character had to be nerfed except Junker Queen KEKW
[2023-01-04 19:20:48] <+justlurkingm8> Buff Hog and Sojourn 😈

[2023-01-04 19:20:50] <uglycri> @vivziewild i’m wondering that too, i guess we’ll just have to wait and see
[2023-01-04 19:20:54] <+aaymon86> Unless he's as strong as Season 1 Zarya, Soujorn or Hog, then he doesn't need a nerf.
[2023-01-04 19:20:54] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @NovaGamr yeah they need to nerf genji first
[2023-01-04 19:20:54] <%RhettOfBodom> so you hate junker queen peepoAngy
[2023-01-04 19:20:56] <+pinkiepantsu> @pinkiepantsu 100% agree

[2023-01-04 19:21:05] <+SPLINTER79> junker queens melee cooldown needs to hit MUUUUCH faster imo
[2023-01-04 19:21:14] <%+pdotLOL> Shes so much fun and if she were at least mid top tier thatd be great
[2023-01-04 19:21:23] <+SPLINTER79> like you hit the button and 3 seconds later her melee goes off
[2023-01-04 19:21:24] <%RhettOfBodom> we've been waiting for that echo damage buff for so long
[2023-01-04 19:21:25] <allenboyhs> when JQ was good, it was unfun

[2023-01-04 19:21:35] <+piperrepip> @Emongg JQ buff could be her self heal from bleed ignores anti heal?

[2023-01-04 19:21:41] <+aaymon86> Junker Queen needs a huge buff to her health regen.  It's pathetically low.

[2023-01-04 19:22:10] <%+DylanInSpace> shouldnt have to bend game mechanics to balance her

[2023-01-04 19:22:18] <+average_chouz> She needs more damage honestly
[2023-01-04 19:22:18] <%bill0b0b> people are also very na-centric when talking about metas. just look at the asia leaderboard for tank @Emongg
[2023-01-04 19:22:19] <%ne0n_black> self heal so little it doesnt matter if it heals thru anti

[2023-01-04 19:23:15] <ChronoAura> the bleed self-healing rate needs to be faster.
[2023-01-04 19:23:21] <%+DylanInSpace> What about the speed instead of overhealth side of shout?

[2023-01-04 19:23:28] <AnthonyMorlacci> give her 75 armor
[2023-01-04 19:23:28] <+aaymon86> I think her shout needs to start cooldown at activation, similar to Ramattra's shield.

[2023-01-04 19:23:55] <%stillarobyn> was the issue with commanding shout more with the teammate overhealth or her own sustain?
[2023-01-04 19:23:55] <%+Astatine85> A little armor or faster axe swing would be nice
[2023-01-04 19:23:56] <ji_ve> bleed is her identity. it needs to feel good. like shield does for rein or jump for winton

[2023-01-04 19:25:53] <%+pdotLOL> MAKE E 1shot.
[2023-01-04 19:25:55] <cdherrington> or maybe it's called Commanding Shout
[2023-01-04 19:25:58] <joejoe7979> halo needs to go full Fornite game play
[2023-01-04 19:26:03] <+cojosao> easy, just make commanding shout only effect JQ but makes her immune to stuns and knockbacks. maybe even change her color to make it more obvious to the enemy
[2023-01-04 19:26:04] <%RhettOfBodom> bring back lucio damage beat experimental
[2023-01-04 19:26:06] <mamattra> it'd be fine if they nerf shout and buff her overall

[2023-01-04 19:26:52] <AnthonyMorlacci> her commanding could be lowered tbh
[2023-01-04 19:27:07] <%+MantisTboggan45> 5 sec on self, 3 for team
[2023-01-04 19:27:07] <%ne0n_black> I like the power of CS being rebalanced for JQ instead of her team
[2023-01-04 19:27:13] <+aaymon86> Knife cooldown could go down to 4 seconds?

[2023-01-04 19:27:32] <Doongus> give her a  passive like cant be headshot more than once in 10 seconds
[2023-01-04 19:27:36] <+stubept> Speed up the hammer swing
[2023-01-04 19:27:37] <+star___bright> The DoT and lifesteal need to do more than just tickle
[2023-01-04 19:27:39] <+neesygg> do you think her heals should fully stack like her dots? Cause I do not heal as much as I think I should for multiple dots

[2023-01-04 19:27:49] <%+Astatine85> Just like 375 health and 50 armor
[2023-01-04 19:27:55] <CircusDeluxe> Do you think she needs more damage or more self heal?
[2023-01-04 19:28:02] <+biffmix> I'd love more team-based abilities that require skill
[2023-01-04 19:28:04] <+neesygg> like melee then knife throw was each like 19 heals. Stacked they were only 29.
[2023-01-04 19:28:05] <+PadenGG> @Emongg What do you think of the idea that her bleed makes targets do ~15-20% less damage
[2023-01-04 19:28:16] <Doongus> true
[2023-01-04 19:28:22] <ahmi_spam2009> I think her damage is okay but her self heal is lacking
[2023-01-04 19:28:27] <Obast> @PadenGG if they did that, I'd never play Winston again KEKW

[2023-01-04 19:29:01] <%iliketoeatpineapples> they made moira damage orb as damage reduction back in experimental and it was TOO OP

[2023-01-04 19:29:09] <way2formal> New passive: “Australian” it would spawn a gigantic ass spider every 5 minutes
[2023-01-04 19:29:10] <+aaymon86> Ult cooldown charge could be less.  I think it's still one of the longer ults to get.
[2023-01-04 19:29:12] <+biffmix> How do you think they should buff her?
[2023-01-04 19:29:12] <%ne0n_black> what if bleeds lasted longer so you could more reliably stack more healing the longer the fight went on? Zarya is the only tank atm that gets stronger as the fight lasts longer
[2023-01-04 19:29:14] <+star___bright> What's the DoT right now? Like 25 on a stick? 25 is nothing
[2023-01-04 19:29:16] <tntnew> how do we buff my girl brig?

[2023-01-04 19:30:52] <Midnide> Id say they should dubble all numbers in the game. HP. DMG and Healing so thesy have more wiggleroom with their numbers (Soldier for example)

[2023-01-04 19:31:01] <ImpossibleGT> I do think giving JQ more ammo would help her alot. Like 8 or 10 before she has to reload would go a long way toward letting her brawl like she wants to

[2023-01-04 19:32:17] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @gwagju STOP
[2023-01-04 19:32:20] <masqru> does hog get his one shot removed in the next update ?
[2023-01-04 19:32:29] <ahmi_spam2009> what do you think about giving cass flash and fan back?
[2023-01-04 19:32:31] <cosimoinexile> two things to look at would be a little more healing on bleed and a little more ammo
[2023-01-04 19:32:37] <%iliketoeatpineapples> hopefully hog get nerf into oblivion
[2023-01-04 19:32:40] <+ben_benitez> What do you think about the push game mode
[2023-01-04 19:32:41] <gwagju> @iliketoeatpineapples wdym coping LMAO orisa is the cancer of this game with hog en
[2023-01-04 19:32:45] <+Necrosythe> just nerfing hog will be huge because that will mean less hog therefore less orisa and also more dive tanks which will also change dps picks
[2023-01-04 19:32:53] <gwagju> every game theres either hog or orisa
[2023-01-04 19:32:54] <%ne0n_black> if the next patch doesnt nerf hog I have lost all faith in balance team

[2023-01-04 19:33:12] <soapmactavish_12251> nice
[2023-01-04 19:33:15] <Obast> increase cooldown on hog healing ability and put a larger buffer time between the pull and him being able to shoot
[2023-01-04 19:33:30] <%+teeuck> @ne0n_black well first patch fixed the zarya meta everyone was complaining about, and at least they’re trying to fix souj and have plans for hog. We also have more communication. I’d call it a W
[2023-01-04 19:33:32] <+yourguyandrew> Lol
[2023-01-04 19:33:33] <Doongus> I preferred op doom meta over hog/orisa meta
[2023-01-04 19:33:37] <%ne0n_black> orisa is so easy to counter by tanks not named hog and is already bad at dealing with squishies
[2023-01-04 19:33:37] <decoder_merc> Is the new patch coming in an hour??
[2023-01-04 19:33:37] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-04 19:47:40] <%+sticknick55> @emongg what’s your favorite color?
[2023-01-04 19:47:40] <TmTrvlr75> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[2023-01-04 19:47:43] <%blondejohn96> You have to have a very high IQ to understand orisa. The character extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Game sense and positioning most of the games will be lost by a typical player. People who dislike orisa truly ARE idiots. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those simpletons scratching their heads in confusion over orisa’s sheer complexity. And yes by the way, I DO have a orisa tattoo

[2023-01-04 19:47:46] <%ne0n_black> There's plenty of tanks that matchup well into orisa like monkey dva sig

[2023-01-04 19:48:00] <+crzypistachios> @silversword67 beam characters
[2023-01-04 19:48:00] <%ne0n_black> the tanks that counter orisa get countered by hog is the problem
[2023-01-04 19:48:01] <doc_heinz_doofenshmirtz> and when doom was op
[2023-01-04 19:48:01] <nathanielb_123> I have watched the first drop for an hour will I be able to get the skin
[2023-01-04 19:48:05] <%blondejohn96> i really should have busted it out much earlier vent
[2023-01-04 19:48:07] <%ne0n_black> ergo hog is the problem not horse
[2023-01-04 19:48:12] <r0xc> peepoReallyHappy
[2023-01-04 19:48:14] <RaggiOW> so does that mean the point of neft hog is pointless now if you have orisa can counter/good vs hog @Emongg
[2023-01-04 19:48:16] <%+nothinggood27> @Silversword67 beam heros are pretty good, but realistically she's even good into beams rn

[2023-01-04 19:48:40] <%$TheNastyFridge> @easy_payments It theoretically means "Kiriko is one shot away from being killed", mostly it just means the caller is shooting that enemy and have gotten them to maybe half, it's basically a call to focus someone
[2023-01-04 19:48:42] <+Evildee87> Orisa has no counters, just some heroes that aren't terrible against her
[2023-01-04 19:48:46] <gwagju> we need a nerf on the duration of golden form
[2023-01-04 19:48:46] <nathanielb_123> 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
[2023-01-04 19:48:47] <Obast> if Roadhog is nerfed I do believe Orisa could take over as staple Tank until she's nerfed too
[2023-01-04 19:48:57] <+crzypistachios> @silversword67 yea zar works but be ready to switch if the orisa switches to hog

[2023-01-04 19:48:59] <%ne0n_black> @Evildee87 you counter orisa by ignoring her she has no mobility and little range

[2023-01-04 19:49:03] <+Necrosythe> deff think orisa should get a small nerf after hog gets a big one
[2023-01-04 19:49:08] <%stillarobyn> being a counter doesn't mean the character is better in every circumstance, it means they negate the original hero's impact

Then here in OW2 I was Gold 3 and my friend was unranked and we were being matched with people who ended diamond in season 1. Is that normal?

[2023-01-04 19:57:03] <+steaknegggs> does deaths per 10 affect MMR alot? Like, if a game is hopeless, should I touch in OT even if certain death? Or should I pretend to run into walls and not touch and not die to save MMR?
[2023-01-04 19:57:09] <Obast> I'd probably say I wouldn't want to be hit by a hook and pulled to roadhog, sounds painful

[2023-01-04 19:57:59] <%stillarobyn> @steaknegggs always play a game like it's winnable. It might have slight impact on your performance, across all your games, but one game probably won't impact it enough to throw
[2023-01-04 19:58:00] <%ArchitectOW> this guy cant be real

[2023-01-04 19:58:08] <+Necrosythe> @steaknegggs no one knows. but its entirely possible the game doesnt count it at all. or ignores deaths in the last 30 seconds/OT etc. plus you might get more objective time which may or may not help
[2023-01-04 19:58:09] <ChristianSharkTV> Ram is buff Zen it’s fine

[2023-01-04 19:58:36] <%+Cr4zy_MrKing> I mean I guess I can't complain about the MMR matchmaking since we did win our games with the diamond players, but it still feels a little weird that rank is basically cosmetic when it comes to matchmaking
[2023-01-04 19:58:39] <yubor99> I love the part where he said “take everything from them” and then proceeded to take everything from them.

[2023-01-04 20:00:06] <%$TheNastyFridge> @dapdude25 So it's basically "relative healing"? I see I see NODDERS
[2023-01-04 20:00:12] <+flexico_worldwide> I'm on switch and I can't get out of bronze 5 lol
[2023-01-04 20:00:16] <%blondejohn96> dapdude25 zen can heal 4 teammates for 300 hp/second, so i think he's easily got the highest healing output
[2023-01-04 20:00:17] <Xezc_17> @firebrander95 press w and mouse one if youre playing rein at all times
[2023-01-04 20:00:18] <%dapdude25> @dapdude25 5Head Now you get it
[2023-01-04 20:00:28] <joedatomato> !duo
[2023-01-04 20:00:28] <clever_corvid> Zen is a spiritual healer.  He heals by "removing" (killing) the "impurities of the world" (the opposing team)

[2023-01-04 20:15:00] <+flexico_worldwide> @tehnevo  either kill guardians or get them from shrines,  thats it

[2023-01-04 20:16:01] <%ne0n_black> @tehnevo I assume you're farming for the ancient shiekah armor or w/e its called thats really good against those enemies. Unfortunately until you get that set, the best bet is the deflection. Practice and its not so bad pinky promise! Otherwise the master sword isnt completely terrible for them ig
[2023-01-04 20:16:01] <ImagineV2> @silverjacker close maps he's really good, but open push maps hes ass
[2023-01-04 20:16:01] <%timtheenchantress42> emongg should maybe go zen here
[2023-01-04 20:16:04] <denny_1_1> Bastion doing too much there
[2023-01-04 20:16:14] <%blondejohn96> yeah zen is the pick
[2023-01-04 20:16:17] <tomuchrecoil> tier for ramatra
[2023-01-04 20:16:20] <tomuchrecoil> ?

[2023-01-04 20:16:42] <%naultz24> PLAY ZEN UGH
[2023-01-04 20:16:43] <silverjacker> I think the reduction in his movement speed when in nemesis  was a good thing
[2023-01-04 20:16:51] <+tehnevo> PLAY BALL
[2023-01-04 20:16:51] <silverjacker> play sigma instead
[2023-01-04 20:16:55] <tomuchrecoil> @hyrulemelon OK thank u.

[2023-01-04 20:16:57] <SweatyFlapjacks> @Emongg you can cancel your shift and ult to regain the 250 armor
[2023-01-04 20:16:58] <silverjacker> PLAY SIGMA
[2023-01-04 20:17:02] <ImagineV2> Rama can deal alot of damage thru various ways and the passive dmg via ult is good in close quarters

[2023-01-04 21:01:28] <@%^StreamElements> flashthrashdaddy, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2023-01-04 21:03:37] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-04 21:13:48] <%stillarobyn> @stillarobyn right, and if a lot of that was competitive, you'll be missing a ton of hours because that's from seasons that aren't reflected in your record anymore
[2023-01-04 21:14:01] <+hANseMIl> Its so ridiculous you get more drops from watching people play ow2 than actually playing the game

[2023-01-04 21:15:18] <%stillarobyn> @hANseMIl people underestimate the amount of (basically) free marketing streamers do for the game. new players watch a streamer, see rewards, like the gameplay on stream, think they should check out the game and get the drops themselves

[2023-01-04 21:16:59] <%stillarobyn> @Xadiatul I don't know if they've talked about it officially, but basically it's a TON of data that isn't doing anything in the game, and most players won't even notice it's gone, so it just takes up extra space on their servers

[2023-01-04 21:25:54] <%blondejohn96> if it's a voodoo witch, that's when you gotta worry. otherwise, probably not gonna be an actual curse, though it cant be ruled out. when your toes turn black is when you need to start worrying dapdude25

[2023-01-04 22:22:32] <%stillarobyn> @zombiesgosplat to a degree I agree with that, but I honestly think new players need to play way more QP than they think they do to learn the maps, learn the heroes and abilities better. I entered comp way too early in my gameplay and suffered more because of it

[2023-01-04 22:35:40] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as support, is in fact, healer/support, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, healer+support. Support is not a role unto itself, but rather a component of the core role of healer. Many players play a modified version of the healer role every day without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the role of healer which is widely used today is often called "Support", and many of its users are not aware that it is healer

[2023-01-04 22:36:38] <+zombiesgosplat> yeah idk why alot of support mains get upset when you call them healers... I'm a support main and take my job very seriously and healing is like a major part of the supports job.... I mean you literally get more ult charge from heals than damage and you can damage at the same time as healing usually.

[2023-01-04 22:47:27] <%stillarobyn> in most circumstances I let my nemesis form run out before ulting to extend the duration of the time I'm using nemesis form. I know that's not always the play, but as habit forming
[2023-01-04 22:47:29] <Awaor> axeumSip
[2023-01-04 22:47:34] <%Zhombiefood> what do emotes look like while ulting?  does it keep nemesis form?
[2023-01-04 22:47:38] <$noteveneric> y'all the ram tech that keeps getting mentioned is essentially block-cancelling your ult shots and weaving in melees
[2023-01-04 22:47:42] <%Nennai> @link_into_music doubt that would be a thing
[2023-01-04 22:47:54] <%Zhombiefood> scammed! ty tho
[2023-01-04 22:47:57] <+aaymon86> And that sucks. It'd be nice to see.
[2023-01-04 22:48:02] <certainly_not_a_robot> They realized it would be to tilting
[2023-01-04 22:48:06] <alo_obert> @shiftypigeons Achktually... this tradition comes from chess, where the loser conceded victory saying "good game", and it was pretty bad manners and disrespectful if the winner said it (IIRC) LUL

[2023-01-04 22:48:27] <denny_1_1> I love how Rammatra went from not very good to one of the best tanks we have right now
[2023-01-04 22:48:27] <%Zhombiefood> honestly it's probably just because they can't test every emote for both forms of rammatra. that's a lot of extra work
[2023-01-04 22:48:29] <+iDrewTheDuckBlue> is Ram any good when he comes in from the side?
[2023-01-04 22:48:33] <goldenarcher7> should they buff Bridgette

[2023-01-04 22:50:03] <%Zhombiefood> it reminds me of the brig tech where you could rocket launch by using bash and whip at the same time
[2023-01-04 22:50:11] <$AboveRplacement> because you play all the maps a lot, probably
[2023-01-04 22:50:14] <%phanjessmagoria> def... i was playing comp the other day and only map it gave me was colloseo

[2023-01-04 22:50:27] <Kairak91> map pools should be bigger / rotate more often.
