[2022-12-19 10:34:24] <+Desaytis> a workaround for the dailies inflation on so many characters could be "tickets" per roster per week and you can choose actiivties to do; i.e. 24 tickets total, choose your activities from chaos dungeon, unas, guardians, boss rush etc. and redeem tickets for rewards, maybe cap the maximum amount of numbers for each activitiy so you don't spam one.

[2022-12-19 13:35:25] <+Valk543> I hope this comes across as constructive. The cheatsheet for Brel G4 says that you should rename parties P1 to Blue and Red and P2 to Green White. However the UI for the parties in game is reversed. P1 is green and that caused some confusion for a lot of people.

[2022-12-19 13:49:28] <ksumetaay> hello mr atk how you doing?
[2022-12-19 13:49:39] <oAchelous> the issue is that everything revolves around burst windows now, so if you dont have heavy burst people think the class sucks
[2022-12-19 13:50:08] <jaytie1312> i think slayer will have 1 style like reaper's luna engraving. where she enhance his sword with flame and enhance her specific skills
[2022-12-19 13:50:28] VIEWERS: 1 336
[2022-12-19 13:50:44] <DarylGo> I think slayer have a multiple blade forms.
[2022-12-19 13:51:17] <DarylGo> I guess similar so Erza in Fairytail.
[2022-12-19 13:51:56] <oAchelous> its cool how people are basically getting limit bursts tho, now they will know soul master's pain when they miss KEKW
[2022-12-19 13:52:18] <jaytie1312> @DarylGo that would suit in skills that display diffirent types of sword avatar but not really impressive as a class egraving

[2022-12-19 17:22:58] <+だにい (bmwxboy)> why they made only 2 gates only?
[2022-12-19 17:23:01] <+ibkstorm> how do you get the vykas pet?

[2022-12-19 17:23:33] <Thormenth_> Feels like a waste not including at least gate 3 and 4 Sadge
[2022-12-19 17:23:36] <Sheshantol> g1-4 brel in hell mode would just seem pointleess tbh
[2022-12-19 17:23:39] <%ArcadeAndro> doing all 6 hell is smoge
[2022-12-19 17:23:40] <%lostsoulz1010> 6 gates of hell brel would be insane

[2022-12-19 17:38:27] <Asmii> funnelling bound materials
[2022-12-19 17:38:27] <%ArcadeAndro> they probably want to promote people to play diff classes
[2022-12-19 17:38:27] <Jiinsen> roster wide is better because you can stack like 100 and do it on a new character to push it to lvl 60
[2022-12-19 17:39:24] VIEWERS: 840
[2022-12-19 17:39:34] <+だにい (bmwxboy)> i think because before there was not much to do in Lost Ark in the early time so they gived you to per char?
[2022-12-19 17:41:06] <TotallyNotNoodle> not sure about stacking tickets but they should add a way to grind to Lv60, current leveling is so outdated
[2022-12-19 17:41:13] <Romello_NA> Yoooo
[2022-12-19 17:41:14] <+domprophet> how many powerpass or expres boost did you get in KR since you started...i wanna make all classes and wondered if i should wait for free boosts..Thank you

[2022-12-19 17:46:34] <johniec92> the legendary engraving book price demotivates me from playing -_-
