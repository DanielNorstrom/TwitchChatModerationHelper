[2022-12-13 09:26:31] <some_random_wallaby> there's a big difference in price between pure breeds and *papered* pure breeds in my experience

[2022-12-13 09:27:22] <%DeadPixel21> it cost $1500 around here for a pup
[2022-12-13 09:27:26] <some_random_wallaby> probably on the cheap side
[2022-12-13 09:27:29] <%+ObsidianKingHP> In general Shiba Inu puppies with limited registration from reputable breeders cost between $1400 ‚Äì $2200. Full registration puppies cost between $2000 ‚Äì $3500. There are may other things to consider besides the just base Shiba Inu price.
