[2022-12-20 16:29:28] <%SaintanickClause> Yes BegWan
[2022-12-20 16:29:30] <%Sotetsu> I liked Highschool and college. Everything else stank.
[2022-12-20 16:29:30] <Rhys_Ascart> NOOOOO
[2022-12-20 16:29:32] <!%AirahsELL> i cant make a statement either way, i slept through most of it.
[2022-12-20 16:29:32] <%+darkteatime> no
[2022-12-20 16:29:33] <+PedroYuuhi> I liked high school, not middle school
[2022-12-20 16:29:34] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> i was bullied viciously no
[2022-12-20 16:29:34] <!%ZiBookishGamer> I liked parts of school
[2022-12-20 16:29:34] <SoulCorky> It was okay. I could play Magic The Gathering during lunch.
[2022-12-20 16:29:35] <%$coolxkappa> no but I miss the socializing now that I live alone as an adult
[2022-12-20 16:29:40] <BlackConvoy> I liked school, aside from having a bad Sophomore year in High School
[2022-12-20 16:29:43] <%+JayBusch> No school, please. I don’t want to pay for being judged on my learning….
[2022-12-20 16:29:43] <!%Catbag> people screaming like you're about to drag them back
[2022-12-20 16:29:46] <+AJ2Kazuya> wow olivia you still haven't eaten that gingerbread man from yesterday D:
[2022-12-20 16:29:47] <thatoldfunnymilk_wolfy> my school was one step away from being the one from another brick in the wall
[2022-12-20 16:29:47] <gambitmojo> i like learning = yes; for me school was diconected to my learning style
[2022-12-20 16:29:49] <%Paranormal_Instigator> as a homeschooler i did not like school
[2022-12-20 16:29:51] <%PigWithoutProtection> my school was really calm, though I didn't care for it that much.
[2022-12-20 16:29:53] <%TheShaffinator> college was alright, everything else sucked fieeerce
[2022-12-20 16:29:56] <Extrafuzzy> I like the people not the classes

[2022-12-20 16:30:06] <%Manny_With_An_M> I didn't go to College, but I tolerated HS. HS in the 90s was very different to today
[2022-12-20 16:30:06] <QuinnHimeSama> Royal Drago doesn't like ze royal assignments!
[2022-12-20 16:30:09] <QuinnHimeSama> Kyahahaha

[2022-12-20 16:30:22] <%AlphaOmega82> Yeah I liked seeing my friends but some of the time I didn't enjoy it
[2022-12-20 16:30:27] <%TheShaffinator> "a little bit"
[2022-12-20 16:30:28] <!%ZiBookishGamer> Overall I liked school though I struggled with it
[2022-12-20 16:30:32] <%RabidBeefalo> It was alright, but I definitely didnt get to talk to as many people as a homeschooler

[2022-12-20 16:35:55] <!%AirahsELL> half life is too jank for stream and no streamer wants their audience to sit through 15 minutes of troubleshooting.
[2022-12-20 16:36:01] <BlackConvoy> professionalism on an Olivia Monroe stream? perish the thought
[2022-12-20 16:36:02] <%$ArcReaper_21> You should try out the Half Life remake, Black Mesa then.
[2022-12-20 16:36:14] <$nive_30si> unstable is half the fun
[2022-12-20 16:36:16] <Komfigaming> black mesa :)
[2022-12-20 16:36:19] <Rarefoil> Play the PS2 version then?
[2022-12-20 16:36:29] <!%AirahsELL> i mean we did that for Simpsons when it froze on you
[2022-12-20 16:36:29] <!%Catbag> Youtube video which is all the tech support portions
[2022-12-20 16:36:30] <@%Athagorn> And the -10min of sleep because of it... PoroSad
[2022-12-20 16:36:31] <%Furudehan> I get the fear of it. I guess I'm the only one who finds scuff entertaining.
[2022-12-20 16:36:35] <%TalkingObject> Ps2 has exclusive content
[2022-12-20 16:36:39] <BlackConvoy> Play the Dreamcast version
[2022-12-20 16:36:42] <+PedroYuuhi> I never played lol
[2022-12-20 16:36:42] <Rarefoil> The PS2 version also supports Keyboard and Mouse
[2022-12-20 16:36:46] <!%+FellyVT> I think original Half-Life 1 & 2 used 5-6 Disks
[2022-12-20 16:36:57] <LordKotsu> when a game is more unstable than my mental health is a big Nope
[2022-12-20 16:36:59] <Rarefoil> @fellyvt nah it didn't
[2022-12-20 16:37:00] <%TalkingObject> Just have a nerd on standby
[2022-12-20 16:37:02] <+machacha_fulgrim> it's understandable nemuHapPat
[2022-12-20 16:37:03] <%AlphaOmega82> I'm sure the chat would get frustrated too
[2022-12-20 16:37:05] <!%AirahsELL> kind of impossible with Diablo since Blizzard actually removed the original from existence when they remade the game.

[2022-12-20 16:55:39] <sleepy_moohnie> but then bosses exploit that kinda mindset to give you double the responsibilities without a single raise
[2022-12-20 16:55:40] <berrymike> the hard work helps you appreciate what you have accomplished
[2022-12-20 16:55:41] <!%AirahsELL> that mentality is only good for hobbies and passion projects. im like that for pretty much anything that isnt my day job. they dont pay me enough to work hard.
[2022-12-20 16:55:47] <%Megaket> The issue is that you're very outwards about it, employers can and will underpay you
[2022-12-20 16:55:47] <%$coolxkappa> its kind of a normal social thing to just hate work even if you dont really hate work
[2022-12-20 16:55:50] <spookgerook> You like to put...Oliv it into a job
[2022-12-20 16:55:57] <!%ZiBookishGamer> my dream job doesn't pay but it will bring me much joy. :)
[2022-12-20 16:56:19] <%+shibiririreruwa> I'm a very hard worker, but there are jobs where waiting and doing nothing is generally part of the job
[2022-12-20 16:56:23] <%PigWithoutProtection> I think that's a bit of a German mentality isn't it? I might hate doing a job, but damn if my personal pride would get hit if I did a bad job
[2022-12-20 16:56:28] <%Leon27607> the issue is if you're in a corporate job a lot of them will just give you more work if you keep finishing them quickly, so a lot of ppl just do the bare minimum
[2022-12-20 16:56:30] <+PedroYuuhi> I love mondays tho
[2022-12-20 16:56:37] <%+aathray> I hate work a lot less now that I don't have to be in an office for it

[2022-12-20 16:56:50] <%$coolxkappa> garfield hated mondays because he wanted to be relatable, not because he had a difficult life

[2022-12-20 16:57:28] <%$KiraNoOkami> From my personal experience espcially with "Things not going the optimal way" it's a bit complicated to stay motivated if your whole professional live is  the equivalent of a dark souls game
[2022-12-20 16:57:38] <tiiimezombie> ideally there's at least some part of your day job that's tolerable/ you can bury yourself in so you don't go insane
[2022-12-20 16:57:39] <merchantilist> I don't mind hard work low pay, but when I get disrespected by management, I leave every mess within contract I can for them.

[2022-12-20 16:58:05] <Krallericoner> It's understandable mentality, but at the same time, I think there definitely should be a limit to an amount of crap one has to tolerate at work.
[2022-12-20 16:58:12] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> "hard work is its own reward" kinda seems like an idea an exploitative company pushes to underpay

[2022-12-20 18:48:04] <IgnorantOrc> you could tell me this is a lux skin and I wouldn't know
[2022-12-20 18:48:07] <%Furudehan> Oli is Seraphine, Lux or Lulu.
[2022-12-20 18:48:12] <%+PedroYuuhi> You are the reason I get a job
[2022-12-20 18:48:13] <+LucaDan> It you become a LoL player you immediately gain +100 greasy
[2022-12-20 18:48:26] <+Savage_Maelstrom> Isn't Lulu a yordle?
[2022-12-20 18:48:29] <+egoodtyler> no way  she has the same name as you too

[2022-12-20 18:49:00] <%$salt_wizard> definitely not metaphorical lol
[2022-12-20 18:49:01] <ckay1100> not just a metaphorical sense, a literal sense too
[2022-12-20 18:49:04] <%MintCastella> playing the characters you f ind cutest is the only valid strategy
[2022-12-20 18:49:10] <!%AirahsELL> wait for the fighting game to come out and you can
[2022-12-20 18:49:10] <%$Dakmoonshadow> Oli is in League. pkroseBOOM
