[2023-01-08 10:26:20] <%AchievementSlayer> @Fenix_TV the detailing comes from drybrushing
[2023-01-08 10:27:19] <%AchievementSlayer> you take a drypaint brush (looks like a makeup brush), put a minimal amount of paint on the pallate and make a faint amount of paint on the bristles...
[2023-01-08 10:27:36] <%AchievementSlayer> and then you start rubbing the paint all over. It makes FANTASTIC results

[2023-01-08 10:28:04] <%AchievementSlayer> Took me a little while to master the technique. works better on more larger solid pieces

[2023-01-08 13:18:43] <@%Toonfish> speaking of
[2023-01-08 13:18:51] <@%Damhain> 3/5 ranked games someone is throwing
[2023-01-08 13:18:53] <@%Toonfish> I beat the nexto bot in a 1v1 yesterday OkuuNODDERS
[2023-01-08 13:19:05] <@%Damhain> then just blaming someone else
[2023-01-08 13:19:37] <@%Damhain> its no longer fun and after 2300 hours i think i have had my fill of trying to get people to play the game they are playing
[2023-01-08 13:20:03] <@%Duo11> There really has been an epidemic of petty weirdos who will throw the game as soon as they see their teammates do something they disagree with.
[2023-01-08 13:20:15] <@%Duo11> I just play 1v1 games cirComfy
[2023-01-08 13:20:18] <@%Damhain> but its so many people with the mentality of "I DONT WANNA PLAY and now YOU DONT get to play either"
[2023-01-08 13:20:20] <@%Toonfish> aw man that sucks Damhain MingLow

[2023-01-08 13:24:02] <%AchievementSlayer> CirnoShrug I don't know
[2023-01-08 13:25:30] <@%Damhain> which one is nexto is that is ssl one or gc one
[2023-01-08 13:26:16] <@%Toonfish> mid gc
[2023-01-08 13:27:31] <@%Damhain> we lost
[2023-01-08 13:27:46] <@%Damhain> the dude tried to ff when we were down one
[2023-01-08 13:27:51] <@%Damhain> with 3 minutes left
[2023-01-08 13:28:07] <@%Damhain> i just dont understand the mentality of competive kids today
[2023-01-08 13:28:32] <@%Damhain> when i was their age the game wasnt over untill that clock said 0 and if we fucked up we owned up to it
[2023-01-08 13:28:43] <@%Damhain> the fuck happened?
[2023-01-08 13:29:09] <@%Toonfish> CirnoShrug I've had that happen to me 6 years ago
[2023-01-08 13:29:09] <%AchievementSlayer> Kids being kids
[2023-01-08 13:29:13] <@%Toonfish> often
[2023-01-08 13:29:20] <@%Damhain> why play?
[2023-01-08 13:29:28] <@%Toonfish> idk
[2023-01-08 13:29:34] <%AchievementSlayer> because they're stupid CirnoShrug
[2023-01-08 13:29:43] <@%Toonfish> people just wanna do cool shit like the pros do and win
[2023-01-08 13:29:45] <@%Damhain> maybe i should stop trying to understand it and just move on
[2023-01-08 13:29:51] <@%Toonfish> and don't want to bother with actually getting better
[2023-01-08 13:29:54] <@%Toonfish> so they get mad when they lose
[2023-01-08 13:29:56] <@%Damhain> which is unfortunate cause 2300 hours
[2023-01-08 13:30:32] <@%Damhain> I had a dude earlier miss 8 open nets then blame me for not scoring
[2023-01-08 13:30:36] <@%Damhain> 8
[2023-01-08 13:30:42] <@%Damhain> compleatly open nets
[2023-01-08 13:30:49] <@%Toonfish> stop spectating my games Damhain cirPls
[2023-01-08 13:30:58] <@%Damhain> Put the round thing
[2023-01-08 13:31:02] <@%Damhain> INTO the rectangle
[2023-01-08 13:31:40] <%TheGHA> i have breakfast
[2023-01-08 13:31:55] <%Demeorin> NitoriNom
[2023-01-08 13:32:15] <@%Damhain> I think im gonna do my placements for 3s see where it puts me then stop playing cause this is fucking rough
[2023-01-08 13:33:02] <@%Damhain> cause with the people its matched me with im on track to be placed into gold 3 or plat 1
[2023-01-08 13:33:06] <@%Damhain> and thats fucking funny
[2023-01-08 13:35:37] <@%Damhain> from a psycology standpoint i wonder if someone has graphed a trend in behavior over the years that would show what i see in competive anything today
[2023-01-08 13:37:51] <%AchievementSlayer> Do A case study
[2023-01-08 13:38:05] <%AchievementSlayer> record all your game interactions and record a spectator view
[2023-01-08 13:38:15] <%AchievementSlayer> ask the government to fund your study
[2023-01-08 13:38:32] <%AchievementSlayer> Claim it's to study "toxic behaviors"
[2023-01-08 13:40:12] <@%Damhain> 45 seconds into this match and my 2 mates are already attacking one another
[2023-01-08 13:57:26] <@%Toonfish> Damhain I could make a smurf and we queue together cirBrows
[2023-01-08 13:57:36] <@%Damhain> the thing is
[2023-01-08 13:57:43] <@%Damhain> IM technically the smurf here
[2023-01-08 13:58:56] <@%Toonfish> ? naroEhehe
[2023-01-08 14:02:05] <@%Damhain> im playing gold3s
[2023-01-08 14:02:14] <@%Damhain> i havent been gold in over a year
[2023-01-08 14:02:29] <@%Damhain> BUT ITS A TEAM GAME
[2023-01-08 14:02:33] <@%Toonfish> pretty sure I would still be the bigger smurf in that situation cirMini
[2023-01-08 14:02:41] <@%Damhain> thats not my point
[2023-01-08 14:02:47] <@%Toonfish> oh ok cir3
[2023-01-08 14:03:01] <@%Damhain> You would be smurfing me who is smurfing till me get to like champ
[2023-01-08 14:03:09] <@%Damhain> then it would i assume just be you
[2023-01-08 14:03:23] <@%Toonfish> oh I get it now when you said "here" you meant the current situation you're in and not the hypothetical one I proposed
[2023-01-08 14:03:27] <@%Damhain> but idk some of these kids in champ gc are dumb
[2023-01-08 14:03:36] <@%Damhain> aye
[2023-01-08 14:03:44] <@%Damhain> holy shit this piano is loud
[2023-01-08 14:04:03] <@%Toonfish> ROWOW PianoTime
[2023-01-08 14:04:19] <@%Damhain> im at a point in the ranks where i cant go on the defese cause my team cant score
[2023-01-08 14:04:54] <@%Damhain> and cant offend cause they just let goals in so im stuck in this really weird 3rd man situation
[2023-01-08 14:05:12] <@%Damhain> trying to huck balls into the wall to MAYBE set up passing plays
[2023-01-08 14:05:17] <@%Damhain> which most cant read
[2023-01-08 14:05:36] <@%Toonfish> you could practice long shots with training packs or something, anything up to champ 3 tends to drive up too far and can't deal with strong shots on net from the opposite goal
[2023-01-08 14:05:47] <@%Damhain> i even dimed a few of them only for them to panic and send it back to our net somehow
[2023-01-08 14:05:47] <@%Toonfish> and even then champ 3s drive up too far against SSLs naroSlain
[2023-01-08 14:06:39] <@%Damhain> I have not once done a training pack and the ones i did just to see for like a minute were champ/gc ones
[2023-01-08 14:07:18] <@%Damhain> you dont need fancy mechanics to do well at this game yet as you mentioned earlier its all you see pros do
[2023-01-08 14:07:57] <@%Damhain> and Jonny Gold sees it and tries to replicate it for his 2 followers on tik tok
[2023-01-08 14:08:03] <@%Toonfish> ye
[2023-01-08 14:08:19] <@%Damhain> i wish i recorded all my games for fun
[2023-01-08 14:08:43] <@%Damhain> the people with either ttv yt or tik tok in their name are some of the WORSE players
[2023-01-08 14:08:52] <@%Damhain> and not skill
[2023-01-08 14:08:58] <@%Toonfish> yup can confirm
[2023-01-08 14:09:08] <@%Damhain> their entire personality and how they play is gross
[2023-01-08 14:09:24] <@%Toonfish> @Damhain I have recorded like 80% of my matches
[2023-01-08 14:09:29] <@%Toonfish> I have 12k replays or something LuL
[2023-01-08 14:09:39] <@%Damhain> how much data is that
[2023-01-08 14:09:46] <@%Damhain> or do you just have the ball chasing data
[2023-01-08 14:10:09] <@%Damhain> which i think stores it differently than a raw video idk
[2023-01-08 14:10:47] <@%Toonfish> I stored them as rocket league replays, those just store the gameplay, not the video feed so they're not as large
[2023-01-08 14:10:51] <@%Toonfish> lemme check how much space they take up
[2023-01-08 14:11:09] <@%Damhain> two nights ago i went from d1 to the edge of d3 then straight back to d1 tonight cause its the weekend and kids are out of school tdogSteve
[2023-01-08 14:11:27] <@%Damhain> maybe thats what i can change
[2023-01-08 14:11:37] <@%Damhain> only play the game when i know most of the kids are not online
[2023-01-08 14:11:49] <@%Damhain> that could work
[2023-01-08 14:12:36] <@%Damhain> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50XxVRISoTk also this is what was loud pianer

[2023-01-08 14:18:07] <@%Damhain> do you not have access to tissues with aloe in them?
[2023-01-08 14:18:37] <@%Toonfish> even those make your nose sore after a while
[2023-01-08 14:18:51] <@%Damhain> wouldnt know

[2023-01-08 15:37:31] <@%Damhain> whats the ssl one calles nesto?
[2023-01-08 15:37:43] <@%Damhain> its a really similar name

[2023-01-08 15:38:08] <@%Toonfish> the SSL bot is called Tecko
[2023-01-08 15:38:14] <@%Toonfish> but that's still work in progress allegedly
[2023-01-08 15:38:16] <@%Damhain> THATS what it was
[2023-01-08 15:40:33] <@%Damhain> i think i someone gave my self a false memory of watching a video about tecko

[2023-01-08 15:43:09] <@%Damhain> with it being already ss on the wall need to use more boost to push the ball further up the wall to celing pinch with zero
[2023-01-08 15:44:13] <@%Damhain> cause i feel like with better management it could have double tapped that off a ceiling pinch
[2023-01-08 15:44:23] <@%Damhain> or just lasered it top shelf
[2023-01-08 15:44:59] <@%Toonfish> that was pretty much perfect boost management, shot the ball right as the boost counter hit 0
[2023-01-08 15:45:05] <@%Toonfish> the setup just wasn't quite perfect
[2023-01-08 15:45:10] <@%Toonfish> or the dodge timing was half a frame off

[2023-01-08 15:51:19] <@%Toonfish> to me it just looked like throwing the ball away
[2023-01-08 15:51:30] <@%Damhain> it looked like the reverse wall jump tech they found a few months ago
[2023-01-08 15:51:40] <@%Toonfish> ok we must be talking about different situations
[2023-01-08 15:52:07] <@%Damhain> which i think is just FS tech

[2023-01-08 16:06:16] <@%Damhain> idk if i finished the thought earlier but i wished normal games played like this when you score its immediatly into the next kick off
[2023-01-08 16:07:50] <@%Toonfish> I've played that format a bit, it's pretty tiresome because half the match starts to revolve just being in the middle whenever a goal is scored
[2023-01-08 16:08:00] <@%Toonfish> revolve around
[2023-01-08 16:08:34] <@%Damhain> oh that that agressive just remove the goal explosions and cam
[2023-01-08 16:08:45] <@%Damhain> and make the kickoff timer 1 second
[2023-01-08 16:09:11] <@%Toonfish> that could be fun I guess OhIToot
[2023-01-08 16:09:24] <@%Toonfish> I like the little break whenever a goal happens though cir3

[2023-01-08 18:58:56] <%Houdini111> My problem is far more frequent than weeks. It's more like days, and when it's having a fit it tends to be more like hourly.

[2023-01-08 19:04:37] <%Houdini111> Well, I should be getting a new MB and CPU this week so if my problem stops happening then a PCIe ethernet card could fix it. Otherwise it would seem to be an OS thing.

Little click out of 3, must be a two-factor authentication. Click out of 4. Click out of 5. Back to the beggining. Click out of 3 and we've got chat spamming. MumeiTap
