[2022-12-11 06:13:27] <+MadLeds> @emma_voir cups don't grow mold or bacteria because they are open and the moisture dries out. Bottles grow a lot of nasty shit inside because it retains moisture

[2022-12-11 07:00:17] <PedrovskiTV> Made modifiers to Area of Effect apply to the area Seismic Trap's bursts can target at a ratio. This will slightly improve the area coverage of the skill while lowering the damage growth from increases to Area of Effect without removing their damage benefit entirely.

[2022-12-11 09:42:46] <%+moraxis> @ds_lily fun fact: part of why the American invasion of Iraq turned out as it did was because we failed to protect the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad, which resulted in antiquities dating back to Mesopotamia being looted and destroyed. Shortly thereafter the insurgency was born.

[2022-12-11 09:47:30] <%Useless_Eater> "The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period." peepoDetective

[2022-12-11 10:10:12] <%Hofled> I recently tried out the new "Sanctum" league in "Path of Exile" and was extremely disappointed. The new league mechanics were confusing and difficult to navigate, and the rewards for completing objectives were underwhelming. Additionally, the new content felt repetitive and uninspired. Overall, I would not recommend this league to other players. It's a waste of time and not worth the effort.

[2022-12-11 10:43:06] <%Hofled> As the greatest Rhoa of all time, I roamed the land of Wraeclast with pride and determination. My sharp beak and powerful legs allowed me to dominate the other monsters, and I quickly rose to the top of the food chain. But my reign was not meant to last. One day, a player stumbled upon my lair and before I could even react, they unleashed a barrage of spells and attacks upon me. I tried to fight back, but it was no use. The player was too powerful, and I was no match for their weapons and skills
[2022-12-11 10:43:09] <%Hofled> In a moment of desperation, I let out a deafening cry, hoping to intimidate my attacker. But it was to no avail, and with one final strike, they ended my life. As I lay dying on the ground, I realized that even the greatest of us Rhoas are no match for the players of Path of Exile. But my legacy will live on, and I will always be remembered as the greatest Rhoa of all time.

[2022-12-11 10:53:33] <Nuvaa> If the Phantasmagoria map in Path of Exile were to have a smell, it might be a mix of various scents. The map takes place in a dream-like realm, so the smell could be a mixture of sweet and alluring scents, such as lavender and vanilla, mixed with more ominous and foreboding smells, such as burning incense and musty old books. Overall, the smell of the Phantasmagoria map might be both intoxicating and unnerving.

[2022-12-11 10:57:44] <%Hofled> Maven and Einhar had been traveling together for months, fighting their way through the brutal world of Wraeclast. Despite their differences, they had grown close, bonding over their shared struggles and goals. One evening, as they set up camp for the night, Maven couldn't help but feel a spark of attraction for Einhar. She had always admired his strength and cunning, and the way he moved with grace and precision in battle.
[2022-12-11 10:57:47] <%Hofled> She watched as he tended to the fire, his muscles rippling beneath his armor. She could feel her heart racing and her body growing warm. Maven decided to take a risk and make her move. She approached Einhar, standing behind him and slipping her arms around his waist. He tensed for a moment, but then relaxed as he realized her intention. "Maven," he said, turning to face her. "Is this what you want?" "Yes," she whispered, gazing into his eyes. "I want you, Einhar."

[2022-12-11 10:57:55] <%Hofled> Without another word, Einhar pulled her into his arms, kissing her deeply. Maven melted into his embrace, feeling his warmth and strength as they embraced. As the fire crackled and danced, Maven and Einhar explored each other's bodies, their hands and lips roaming freely. They shed their armor and clothes, reveling in the pleasure of being together. Maven moaned softly as Einhar's fingers trailed over her sensitive skin, making her shudder with desire.

[2022-12-11 11:57:06] <+Fedderino> hey does anyone know, combustion isnt "fixed" yet right? so either the main dmg skill has to use it, or if you use another skill to apply it, that skills ignite has to have a longer duration, correct? so support skill + unbound ailments should solve it?
[2022-12-11 11:57:48] <+Fedderino> i think the ggg post said the lower dmg ignite gets culled if it hasnt got a longer duration

[2022-12-11 11:58:35] <+Fedderino> yeah crappy but then if the main skill applied a newer, stronger ignite you lose the combustion again :(

[2022-12-11 12:10:49] <arrathem> also World Bosses in an ARPG game?
[2022-12-11 12:10:51] <arrathem> LMAO
[2022-12-11 12:10:58] <%Useless_Eater> @Nite01 idk about what others think, but i'm super put off by the price tag dslilyThink 70 bugs to pay up front with stuff like season passes in the game too? eeeeeeh
[2022-12-11 12:11:10] <stessian> @Ryddenn It reminded me of d3 and how limited you were is all
[2022-12-11 12:11:18] <arrathem> and the boss fights looked really boring and required like no dodging at all
[2022-12-11 12:11:32] <%Nite01> @Useless_Eater for the digital version ??
[2022-12-11 12:11:32] <arrathem> the whole gameplay showcase was a residentsleeper
[2022-12-11 12:11:38] <%Useless_Eater> @Nite01 yea
[2022-12-11 12:11:41] <%Nite01> LOLW
[2022-12-11 12:11:43] <%Nite01> no way
[2022-12-11 12:11:44] <Ryddenn> @arrathem  id say its not an arpg more of a dark gothic dungeoung crawler slow and dark no zooming but yeah it laks endgame
[2022-12-11 12:11:53] <%Nite01> I dont believe that
[2022-12-11 12:11:53] <arrathem> If its not an ARPG
[2022-12-11 12:11:59] <arrathem> then they ruined the game mate ...
[2022-12-11 12:12:01] <%Nite01> it used to be 90 eur for the collector version of the games
[2022-12-11 12:12:03] <arrathem> and butchered Diablo
[2022-12-11 12:12:06] <%Nite01> with the big box
[2022-12-11 12:12:28] <stessian> They ruined it when they made diablo mobile.
[2022-12-11 12:12:30] <%Nite01> 70 eur for a digital version I ll never pay
[2022-12-11 12:12:33] <arrathem> Path of Exile is the true inheritor of D2 and nothing can change that as it seems

[2022-12-11 12:14:58] <stessian> They make games look good but don't add any depth. That alone is the problem with most of their games

[2022-12-11 12:17:30] <%Useless_Eater> @stessian NODDERS they want it to appeal to as many as possible, adding depth works against that by reducing accessibility, it  justdoesnt make sense for them monetarily to add the depth that would keep players like us playing the game longer Smoge
[2022-12-11 12:17:33] <jaytheproduct> D3 is only worth playing in a 4man
