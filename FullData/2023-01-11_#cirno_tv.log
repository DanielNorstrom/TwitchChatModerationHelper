[2023-01-11 00:10:35] <%Illylia> Something about mahjong to remember, even for professional players, they are only expected to take first like 30% of the time. They are also expect to finish 4th like 20% of the time. It's a hard game with a lot of luck.
[2023-01-11 00:10:36] <%+Oblivion___TV> nah all you need to learn is the set boards

[2023-01-11 00:11:48] <Stereo_Future> Yeah, I think the Shogi trophy isn't too bad. I want to say the Mahjong one required more actual understanding

[2023-01-11 02:48:51] <AwesomeOutcast> @bobtron007 the biggest difference is that the hands which count as mahjong change yearly. There’s a card you buy for each year. I honestly don’t like that it feels scummy. It’s been a while since I last played though. I remember there’s an initial round at the beginning where you trade tiles with the person next to you.
[2023-01-11 02:49:02] <%gachaisgarbage> I am currently going through the phases of getting better and worse because I keep on sabotaging easy hands for higher value hands LUL

[2023-01-11 03:26:28] <%bigdumpfarts> yeah, they tell you you're done at some point essentially
[2023-01-11 03:26:29] <%+Asmmodeus> the only aone allowed to take money is the casino

[2023-01-11 03:26:59] <%bigdumpfarts> but also the good casinos use multiple decks and other stuff to make it really hard
[2023-01-11 03:27:00] <%Gyrox> That is super scummy

[2023-01-11 03:27:09] <%gachaisgarbage> welcome to casinos
[2023-01-11 03:27:11] <%Band_of_Goblins> card counting itself isnt against the law unless your using electronic means
[2023-01-11 03:27:15] <%gachaisgarbage> they are scummy as hell
[2023-01-11 03:27:17] <@%Zen_Wan> WanWan When you are deluded and full of doubt, even a thousand books of WAN are not enough WanWan
[2023-01-11 03:27:19] <%Gyrox> It's not like card counting is losing the casino a lot of money
[2023-01-11 03:27:23] <%kirbydance> most places you dont have to show id to be trespassed so if they ask for id tell them no. to be tresspassed they have to give you the opportunity to leave first. then if you come back thats when you get formally tresspassed
[2023-01-11 03:27:30] <%rhk341> dont they use like 8 decks for black jack
[2023-01-11 03:27:31] <+PartyBus_TV> that is a lot of honor discards

[2023-01-11 03:28:12] <%aniki_herrington> the odds are always rigged in the casino's favor, card counting at least evens the odds
[2023-01-11 03:28:15] <%ChaosLordR> how does he prove age otherwise
[2023-01-11 03:28:16] <+SlothsAllTheWay> thanks

[2023-01-11 05:58:21] <%Houdini111> cirPomp I'm on a 8700k right now. I'm feeling the bottleneck so I'll be really happy to get 50% more frames and 3x the CPU horsepower.
[2023-01-11 06:01:02] <%another_tristan> ive been really happy with an amd from a couple years ago. two recent intels i've used have both been very disappointing and overheat themselves
[2023-01-11 06:02:18] <!%Zoeyism> Same, AMD tends to last longer IMO cirComfy
[2023-01-11 06:03:21] <%another_tristan> its been a long time since i had an AMD system... the last time i did they didnt have good thermal protection and you could roast the chip if the cooler wasnt on right
[2023-01-11 06:03:28] <%Houdini111> That's a big reason I'm getting a 7000 instead of 13000. Unlike my 8700k I'll actually have an upgrade path.
[2023-01-11 06:03:34] <%another_tristan> but i mean that was Long ago
[2023-01-11 06:05:36] <%Houdini111> If I can get a theoretical R9 9900 some years down the line then and maybe get better RAM I really can't see myself being bottleneck for years and years.
[2023-01-11 06:07:02] <%another_tristan> the last intel computer i got for games stopped being able to play games mostly because i kept it on windows 7 rather than any hardware issue. unless you really want to play AAA in high res you can last a really long time
