[2022-12-12 03:29:18] <@%ParanoidCorgi> and he was sterotypical american
[2022-12-12 03:29:22] <!%Kirsche> digimon was p big, the show was better than pokemon
[2022-12-12 03:29:29] <!%Kirsche> but digimon games were uhhh not near as fun as pokemon
[2022-12-12 03:29:30] <+JayBusch> There's quite a bit that actually came over recently. Old games didn't but new stuff does.
[2022-12-12 03:29:30] <%Rappolt> In Cybersleuth, there's a plotline where a kid hijacks his bullies' brains and tries to make them jump off the school roof. They let him in cause they wanted him to do their tests
[2022-12-12 03:29:31] <Jckun> Oh etamon I believe

[2022-12-12 03:29:45] <coconutackle> Pokemon never went anywyhere digimon had a central story making it better
[2022-12-12 03:29:50] <%Rappolt> It really shouldn't be fighting words. Pokemon is kinda weak in plot

[2022-12-12 06:13:59] <%+rapaxus> And if you use q-tips, at least make them wet or you risk getting cotton stuck in your ears just attracting ear wax to build up on it
[2022-12-12 06:13:59] <+mister_commando> I too have tinnitus and use qtips in my ears

[2022-12-12 06:16:10] <+JayBusch> @noobte You can briefly reset it if you cover your ears with your palms to make a seal, with your fingers resting on the back of your head. Then drum your fingers on your head while maintaining the seal. Remove palms and you may have some relief temporarily.
[2022-12-12 06:16:14] <slackerlate> irl I don't like that cotton, but if it's asmr it's better
