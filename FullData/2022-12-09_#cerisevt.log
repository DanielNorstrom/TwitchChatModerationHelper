[2022-12-09 10:40:37] <%bunglinglummox> @Graknorke explain what is forgiving about a system that doesn't tell you sieges can happen until one of them arrives
[2022-12-09 10:40:55] <Karinthere> I started a fort last night but the only river freezes over for half of the year and I haven't found any mushrooms yet. I'm not sure we'll survive. LUL
[2022-12-09 10:41:04] <Karinthere> @Graknorke You can turn enemies off though.
[2022-12-09 10:41:12] <%Graknorke> you can defeat the bulk of sieges with a single door
[2022-12-09 10:41:25] <KaitoOnTheClock> @bunglinglummox What you don't know can't hurt you. Until you know that is KEKW
[2022-12-09 10:41:57] <Karinthere> I was in the middle of trying to use the river to irrigate and then it dissapeared, was very confused.
[2022-12-09 10:42:13] <%bunglinglummox> @Karinthere Sure, and you can mod the raws so that dwarves don't need food or drink. Being able to modify the settings isn't the same as being "mechanically forgiving".
[2022-12-09 10:42:18] VIEWERS: 119
[2022-12-09 10:42:37] <%Graknorke> "not telling you things" isn't the same as being unforgiving
[2022-12-09 10:42:52] <%bunglinglummox> It is *exactly* the same. That siege is going to ruin you.
[2022-12-09 10:42:55] <%Graknorke> the point is it doesn't demand anywhere near perfect play at all to survive
[2022-12-09 10:43:06] <%+Venaliter> @bunglinglummox - I figure the answer to whether DF is mechanically forgiving or not is that same as: Do atom-smashers still work?
[2022-12-09 10:43:21] <%bunglinglummox> @Venaliter ask the bronze colossus
[2022-12-09 10:43:49] <%Graknorke> by that argument Super Mario Bros is unforgiving because it doesn't tell you that the goombas hurt you
[2022-12-09 10:43:52] <ZongTG> You can go out into the work orders tab to change the number

[2022-12-09 11:04:07] <%bunglinglummox> You can make a functioning computer out of floodgates and pressure plates, but if you want something to go bang you basically have to pressurise magma... which is harder than it sounds.

[2022-12-09 11:05:16] <%bunglinglummox> Someone did make a working magma cannon, but the effective range was shorter than the effective *radius*.

[2022-12-09 11:30:02] <%$darkkrusty> playing rimworld is actually a good way to get into Dwarf fortress, it helps ya figure out some mechanics that are familiar, however DF depth is beyond anything you can comprehend, also, Rimworld is about the ending, DF is the journey and how it all goes tits up.
[2022-12-09 11:30:07] <%bunglinglummox> @TheKneeCapKnabber it does not

[2022-12-09 11:33:41] <%bunglinglummox> Boatmurdered was a community succession fort that fell in hilarious fashion. The saga includes legendary murderous elephants, thieving birds, inadequate labelling and lots of magma.
[2022-12-09 11:33:43] <%FrostLancer7> I look forward to the bets on how long the colonies last.

[2022-12-09 11:34:31] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> Had a lot of drama in my most recent rimworld colony about 2 years in game ago. The sole male colonist of the colony lost his wife and mother of one of his children to mechanoids, and the next set of kids he had as babies at the time are now all grown up, sadly only one of them gets to know their still living mother
[2022-12-09 11:34:33] <%bunglinglummox> Pro tip: "What does this lever do?" is a fun present to leave in a succession fort.
[2022-12-09 11:34:40] <healbotfh> chatters help me this merchant wont leave my fortress, she's just stuck standing near my depot for almost a year

[2022-12-09 11:35:10] <%Graknorke> a lot of the players added various death traps for defence or for fun but didn't label which label controlled what so for the next one to take over it became kind of a guessing game
[2022-12-09 11:35:18] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> @FrostLancer7 I can't do that sadly cause I also want to do bets on warhammer
[2022-12-09 11:35:36] <%bunglinglummox> Boatmurdered included an arc where they built something called "Project 'Fuck the world'".
[2022-12-09 11:35:47] <%FrostLancer7> So we've had scifi, Norse and dwarf colony sims, what next? Pirate country sim?
[2022-12-09 11:36:01] <%darkkrusty> I actually turned the coin trap room into just a defence mechanicism for shits and giggles once, nothing beats watching a dragon bust its way in coolaid style only to die by legal tender.
[2022-12-09 11:36:24] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> The tree is basically The Father, Now Dead Wife and Daughter, second baby momma (they're not married, and were ex lovers at one point. Its messy) and their child, the babies now grown up from both mothers, and another two vat kids from the remaining mother who are his first two sons
[2022-12-09 11:36:28] <%bunglinglummox> But the coins aren't even legal tender with the economy disabled.

[2022-12-09 11:39:24] <%FrostLancer7> Dwarf Fortress is as much a Rimworld clone as .Hack// is an SAO clone

[2022-12-09 11:39:32] <Icheras> DF isn't a RW clone, they are both pong clones

[2022-12-09 11:39:45] <%bunglinglummox> @verajonson the joke is that DF is way older and inspired rimworld
[2022-12-09 11:39:59] <%bunglinglummox> @bloodiest_burrito yes, but I wasn't sure if anyone had told Cerise that
[2022-12-09 11:40:01] <+drmchsr0> Every game since 1978 is a Pong Clone

[2022-12-09 11:42:02] <%bunglinglummox> I once got caught playing classic DF in the middle of a physics lecture. My teacher took a look at my screen and so "oh, you're working, that's fine".

[2022-12-09 11:44:28] <+drmchsr0> Dwarf Therapist is a standalone program that tracks your dwarves in a somewhat readable and visual interface and runs with the base game

[2022-12-09 11:44:49] <%bunglinglummox> I mean, the dev was able to quit his job and work on it full time even while it was free. And unlike other "free game" it has no microtransactions.
[2022-12-09 11:44:52] <Rahsed> All the hours of Cerise playing RimWorld was just the tutorial for Dwarf Fortress Kappa

[2022-12-09 11:45:36] <%bunglinglummox> People genuinely do go out of their way to support the game, and that's great.
[2022-12-09 11:45:38] <ughdontmakemeregister> there are man- versions of every animal

[2022-12-09 12:35:46] <slackerunchained> You can burn *enemy*/non-dwarf corpses (or huck them into magma ...though watch out for spashback-mist) but Dwarves will want a proper burial to prevent ghosts or their relatives getting-sad.
[2022-12-09 12:35:47] <%bunglinglummox> fun fact: dwarves go on break and have parties, but it's also possible for a dwarf to go on break *from* a party... in the same room

[2022-12-09 12:40:09] <Karinthere> It's harder to cross out a settled-grudge if it's carved in stone, hah.
[2022-12-09 12:40:37] <%bunglinglummox> They also engrave things that the dwarf has a personal preference for, which is why Boatmurdered was full of three kinds of engravings: dwarves being killed by elephants, dwarves on fire, and /cheese/.
[2022-12-09 12:40:39] <VonGalactic> or an engraving of a dead dog on a table giving everyone miasma
[2022-12-09 12:40:43] <%Spitalier> Usually they engrave things they like. And things they dont like if their mood is on the bad side.

[2022-12-09 12:43:12] <%Spitalier> @Karinthere Dwarfs can be lazy which makes them prone to just hang around and sozialize instead of work.
[2022-12-09 12:43:38] <+GrandmaGusta> grandm2Sip fair enough sometimes you gotta make some wooden stuff to channel your anger into
[2022-12-09 12:43:54] <ughdontmakemeregister> yeah engravings are full of like world generated historical events, mostly weird mundane shit but some are *amazing*

[2022-12-09 12:45:20] <%Spitalier> I once found a vampire in my fort by reading the engravings one of my dwarves did. He depicted the moment when he was struck by the vampire curse.

[2022-12-09 12:47:35] <%Spitalier> bowyer can create underr a mood exotic ranged weapons as well. Which is great, as you can not build the ammunition...
[2022-12-09 12:48:06] <ughdontmakemeregister> yeah if they build an artifact blowgun i might cry

[2022-12-09 12:52:00] <%Spitalier> @Spitalier usually it is a blowgun. Then you need to beat up animal people and hope the got poisen dart in their pockets

[2022-12-09 13:18:28] <%bunglinglummox> Also, as an efficiency tip, try making small stockpiles near your workshops that are assigned to take stock from your other, alrger stockpiles. That way your crafters never have to walk very far to get materials.

[2022-12-09 13:58:33] <%Synesh> You could turn the stones into blocks. 1 stone = 4 stone at 4% weight of a stone.
