A flower stops growing once it has reached age 5 (appearing purple rather than white), but may be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Chorus flowers do not grow if planted 1 block below the surface of the ground."

[2022-12-08 14:22:34] <%legioned247> random fact Because eggplants belong to the nightshade family, they contain an alkaloid called solanine, which can be toxic if consumed in large amounts. Eating the leaves and tubers of nightshade plants can be fatal, as there are large amounts of the alkaloid in parts of the plant that are not normally consumed.

[2022-12-08 14:46:42] <%legioned247> The condor is part of the Inca trilogy, along with the snake and puma. Incas believed the condor was a sacred bird and represented the idea of heaven.

[2022-12-08 14:55:46] <%legioned247> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, “I didn’t do it, my truck did, and it’s dead, so you can’t question it.” The fire destroyed 508 acres (206 ha), burning the foliage off three mountains and driving off forty-nine of the refuge’s 53 endangered condors.  Cash was unrepentant and claimed, “I don’t care about your damn yellow buzzards.” The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,172

[2022-12-08 15:00:36] <$Sly_Nyx> I don't think its that different, and you obviously enjoy this design more and that's all that really matters in the end

[2022-12-08 15:00:38] <!%AxelTheCake> @Sobek_AB I was on a call and came back to this lol
[2022-12-08 15:00:40] <%DJSayori> In theme it makes sense to what you are doing with it, but the 2 characters are different right, i think that is how the lore was right
[2022-12-08 15:00:45] <%KisaiTenshi> Zen felt it was better to fit with the voice

[2022-12-08 15:01:39] <+ToastedSimple> I think this model is the embodiment of your personality and style
[2022-12-08 15:01:50] <%TristanaGW> i think both this model and the old 3D model suited your voice equally, but maybe thats just me lmao
[2022-12-08 15:01:50] <%KisaiTenshi> IMO, I don't feel you did any drastic change that felt like a rebrand

[2022-12-08 15:02:23] <%TristanaGW> i think the main thing people see the difference in is the black and pink hair and maybe the lipstick
[2022-12-08 15:02:30] <!%AxelTheCake> zen started blonde?? *looks it up*
[2022-12-08 15:02:31] <%+yukineb> the change is only drastic if people havent been keeping up, since you've been gradually changing your persona since you first started
[2022-12-08 15:02:32] <%RomblDombl> Iguess it's just because the haire was the most prominent feature
[2022-12-08 15:02:34] <%TyniThe8PoundRobot> Good Morning Candii!

[2022-12-08 15:04:01] <%+Mr_Feyshade> Some vtubers describe it like trying out a new outfit, to see where it fits and where it doesn't. Then, adjustments can be made for the next model.

[2022-12-08 15:04:01] <%DJSayori> @AxelTheCake I think Zen got red hair as part of a RP, and then just stuck with it.

[2022-12-08 15:06:03] <%TristanaGW> i think everyone should try changing models every once in a while. even if they're not a vtuber

[2022-12-08 15:07:43] <%KisaiTenshi> IMO, people should not rebrand (change username and core lore) if they can help it, cause it resets your discovery in search engines. Changing the model though, doesn't do that.

[2022-12-08 15:43:46] <endlesscries> Speaking of breeding, how do we breed these nice lads? Well, answer lies in a new berry this mod also adds - Beetleberry. It can be found rarely spawning throughout the End, or, if you're lucky to find a stable, you can find a few bushes of this new berry right there, next to your new bug friends.
