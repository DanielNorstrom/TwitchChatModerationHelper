[2022-12-17 11:52:42] <+AnabolaSWE> @red_gate07   Basically how it works with mats in ESO is it scales to you characters lvl and you blacksmithing lvl ,so nodes change according to that....if you lvl iup too much low lvl mats gets harde to get and youll have to buy them basically....you can also get certain mats when refining armor at crafting station (heavy for metal) also depending on the lvl of the gear you refine
