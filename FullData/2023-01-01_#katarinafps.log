[2023-01-01 00:14:17] <suh710> I think at low-mid level people like freak out in gun fights, and just start spamming in place. Dms are the best at just desensitizing you to gunfights so you still strafe n tap fire n stuff. And ofc ch placement.

[2023-01-01 04:23:07] <i_miss_my_exx> This is exactly why I hate Twitch chat. This chat is pure, unadulterated, 100% stupidity. Nobody has a single unique, new thought, all spouting the latest meme after meme, that aren't even good. THIS is why I'm turning off chat and will just watch the professional gameplay. And I swear to god, if any of you copy and paste this, I'm deleting my account forever.

[2023-01-01 04:40:26] <@%^Nightbot> I've seen Katarina play, she doesn't even use a monitor. She visualizes the map in a detailed rendering, completely in her mind. She has a biological wallhack; her godlike perception highlights all enemies within light-years. Her eyes are closed as her mouse gracefully swerves across the table, making immaculate twitches as she flicks from head to head. The bullets that escape her gun barrel are surgical; each making a deadly strike in between her opponent's eyes.

[2023-01-01 13:01:09] <+Wallowcaust> @Cmxuh that's pretty sick, but it also depends on a bunch of stuff like what else you played before, like I'm ascendant rn but it took 6 months as my first keyboard and mouse shooter. For most people, it usually takes about double the time it has taken you previously to advance a whole rank (e.g. d3-a3)
