[2022-12-19 01:17:05] <%jacksplatt> when i was in Europe, I wasn't a fan of anything I ate. I really enjoyed Middle Eastern food though.
[2022-12-19 01:17:44] <Amastrisdratwka> All you comments are fair. I'm also not a fan of EU food. I also watched that show 'From Scratch' & see the food & think, "yeah, naw'.. but when I was going to high school in Japan, I was like, "..i never want to go home..' LUL
[2022-12-19 01:17:45] <%jacksplatt> Middle Eastern food when I lived in Bahrain.

[2022-12-19 01:22:23] <Amastrisdratwka> I'm more about saying the generalization that most Europeans automatically say USA food is fat etc...while drinking their reduced sugar Cokes  that has a 61% market share in EU. It's not a realistic comment. It's all based on "weight data" that has multiple reasons, not just food, for it.

[2022-12-19 01:24:10] <+alyoshasdream> eggs and bacon is a great breakfast because it fills you up and you don't have to eat that much of it. You can eat less of satiating foods vs something like carbs.
[2022-12-19 01:24:37] <Anelit21> anyway
[2022-12-19 01:24:40] <Anelit21> god bless McDonalds

[2022-12-19 01:26:28] <%Reloe> it's also hard to get fresh ingredients on a daily basis when you have to drive half an hour out of suburbia to get to a store PepeLaugh
[2022-12-19 01:26:34] <Anelit21> Bacon contains some essential micronutrients, including potassium, which supports bone health, heart health, muscle strength and prevents high blood pressure. You can also find over 50% of the RDA of two essential minerals in bacon; selenium and phosphorus.
[2022-12-19 01:26:38] <Anelit21> thank me later
[2022-12-19 01:26:38] <%Twigbot4k> not been to a food chain in the US since.. 2019.

[2022-12-19 01:27:02] <%gerryblue> to be fair lot of ppl get fast food not cause its cheap but cause its easy
[2022-12-19 01:27:03] <+krycesblooddk> mmm tbh it's like that in london/very western europe, unlimited amounts of delivery options, even in the early AMs
[2022-12-19 01:27:04] <%Twigbot4k> When I went, would be approx once a month.
[2022-12-19 01:27:15] <Amastrisdratwka> Most kids eat cereal for breakfast.. bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles are usually for special times when you go out or have guests.. that's not an everyday kind of food. Or at least ANY American I've known.
[2022-12-19 01:27:38] <%$Stricken79> I love a big breakfast, I make myself a plate sometimes using streaky bacon, panfried cheese kransky, mushrooms, fried tomato and cheesy scrambled eggs. A rare treat
[2022-12-19 01:27:41] <%Sebleh> Nagoogoo how do you determine when to run pulsar vs orbital strike for keys (or in general I guess)? seblehHmm
[2022-12-19 01:27:41] <+turetoRL> @gerryblue it's way cheaper to cook for yourself than order fast food isn't it?
[2022-12-19 01:27:51] <arthritisy> @turetoRL yeah, it is
[2022-12-19 01:27:56] <+alyoshasdream> a lot of americans eat garbage but I don't find it hard to eat healthy in america, nor too expensive

[2022-12-19 01:31:21] <%+Galorinn> Important note about food is that we also tend to visit each others major cities and not the smaller more normal towns.
[2022-12-19 01:31:23] <+moohuu> @naguura the tomatos get refrigirated on transport (because of the other veggies needing it)  and lose a ton of flavor. Tomatos - or their flavor - don't like the cold
[2022-12-19 01:31:27] <arthritisy> the extra costs with eating at a restaurant has gotten crazy in America

[2022-12-19 01:31:58] <+tocu> I think there are a few fancy mcdonalds that you would hang out for a while but thats the exception to the rule
[2022-12-19 01:32:10] <Amastrisdratwka> CA GDP has high agricultural products. Fruit, vegetables, dairy, and wine. Almond's are highest export commodity. Milk is #1 for farming..leads in strawberry production, and ofc wineries.
[2022-12-19 01:32:29] <%gerryblue> who said anything about wine!!!
[2022-12-19 01:32:57] <%$Stricken79> I get 15 minutes for lunch at my work, that does me for 2 cigs and some caffeine naguuraGiggle

[2022-12-19 01:34:30] <Anelit21> i cant even think about what should I eat let alone devote all the time
[2022-12-19 01:34:45] <%$Stricken79> @arthritisy my shifts are 5 hours at most, so it's a break much less lunch. When I worked at the supermarket you would get half and hour for lunch
[2022-12-19 01:34:51] <Flaeshen> But you guys in italy has riposo aswell right so restaurant visits are later during evening right?
[2022-12-19 01:34:57] <+moohuu> If it's 44°C in the shadow in the summer at noon, you do a 2h lunch break

[2022-12-19 01:35:57] <%afishinsea> but are there antlers available perhaps
[2022-12-19 01:35:59] <%gerryblue> half an hour sounds very slack for lunch
[2022-12-19 01:36:40] <%$Stricken79> @gerryblue you could opt in for an hour if you wished, but you would get paid less as lunch was on your time and also it was hard to get going again and get your work done
[2022-12-19 01:36:45] <%warryvibe> Half an hour lunch is common
[2022-12-19 01:36:53] <%afishinsea> i don't really take a lunch

[2022-12-19 01:39:00] <%Sebleh> Here in the US you overpay for a giant plate of mostly carbs.
[2022-12-19 01:39:06] <%Sebleh> a single giant plate*

[2022-12-19 01:39:28] <%mindyourmana> i agree. there arent a lot of places (here at least) that have menus done like that

[2022-12-19 01:39:35] <%afishinsea> i feel like we shouldn't conclude that they've tried it and hated it
[2022-12-19 01:39:42] <%afishinsea> bc i think that's probably not the case
[2022-12-19 01:40:07] <+vorsmyth> In the US thats usually called a "Small Plates" Resturant, or you go to somthing aiming for high dininging and get the chefs tasting courses
[2022-12-19 01:40:20] <+kit_cakez> people are too used to eating a single plate for a meal I guess and they say it's not enough when watching a single plate of the full course meal
[2022-12-19 01:40:21] <%Limdaer> I'm not sure if you can finish this dungeon before your shift KEKW

[2022-12-19 01:56:44] <%afishinsea> @MoonDoggie42 imo no but also haven't played df yet
[2022-12-19 01:56:49] <%Limdaer> Is it possible there will be mythic only phase? Probably not right SadCat
[2022-12-19 01:56:58] <Anelit21> so for next tier we have these new 3 elemental drakes, i assume all 3 will be final boss like council fight?

[2022-12-19 01:57:01] <Anonyme117QC> Will they nerf M+ soon ? some boss and mobs do unreal amount of unavoidable damage ?
[2022-12-19 01:57:05] <Amastrisdratwka> I think the biggest issue they're discussing is the knock back
[2022-12-19 01:57:06] <Anelit21> was there ever a council final boss fight?
[2022-12-19 01:57:08] <%afishinsea> @MoonDoggie42 yep!

[2022-12-19 23:44:43] <@%^StreamElements> Nagura is the first healer I have seen so far who actually understands her role and is good. She understands that a healer's task is to HEAL, which is why the role name is HEALER. She never deals any damage, because she is not a DAMAGE DEALER role. Hopefully the rest of the healers will catch onto that.
[2022-12-19 23:44:59] <@%Kuroz> seblehDinkdonk  people from myst should read the healer command
