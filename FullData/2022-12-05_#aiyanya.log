[2022-12-05 14:24:43] VIEWERS: 151
[2022-12-05 14:24:50] <@%InfiniteYeet> Because you're determining it based on where you want to end up
[2022-12-05 14:24:53] <!%+The_Haytch> greed the east, got it; greast as it were
[2022-12-05 14:25:01] <!%+The_Haytch> grease strat
[2022-12-05 14:25:01] <%jallyman55> i just follow my healer KEKW
[2022-12-05 14:25:08] <%jallyman55> i have never figured that part out
[2022-12-05 14:25:35] <@%operatorviera> brain empty, no thought
[2022-12-05 14:25:35] <@%InfiniteYeet> With poison you are only north got g1
[2022-12-05 14:25:45] <!%gearipeari> i just like start N or S and you end up where you end up
[2022-12-05 14:25:48] <!%dyseal> "MT Team starts North Poison and moves into the touching topaz"
[2022-12-05 14:25:50] <!%gearipeari> my brain is simple
[2022-12-05 14:26:29] <!%dyseal> oh yeah that makes sense
[2022-12-05 14:26:32] <!%dyseal> i get how you think of it now
[2022-12-05 14:26:32] <+enfonius> i don't even look at the crystals, i just go north or south LUL
[2022-12-05 14:26:35] <!%+The_Haytch> one (1) whole less thought
[2022-12-05 14:26:38] <!%+The_Haytch> very important
[2022-12-05 14:26:39] <!%dyseal> "sit behind the north Topaz"

[2022-12-05 14:27:07] <@%Dark_Fable> okay DR done, 2 down 3 to go XD
[2022-12-05 14:27:07] <dregnosol> @enfonius This is how this strat works, just go north as MT every time and it resolves itself
[2022-12-05 14:27:07] <!%gearipeari> group 1 N | group 2 S then move into safe place wherever that may be is how i did it
[2022-12-05 14:27:09] [Points] CrunchMyNutz redeemed Feed Aiya (500)
[2022-12-05 14:27:18] <@%InfiniteYeet> That is more thought for me because it would be: Look at south, look at west, where do I need to be to end up there. Or: Look at south, you're done
[2022-12-05 14:27:19] <+enfonius> strats and guides should always limit the amount of choices. 4Head
