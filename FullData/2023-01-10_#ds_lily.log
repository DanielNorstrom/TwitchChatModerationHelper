[2023-01-10 00:21:02] <%PathOfCheddar> I even got Josh into the game, but he converted to softcore :(
[2023-01-10 00:21:03] <Jukage01> well when u open the tree for the first time as a new player xdd
[2023-01-10 00:21:07] <TheBestJoe> I have more hours reading the wiki and fucking around in PoB than I do in-game Stare
[2023-01-10 00:21:08] <%+rabidwombats> @arnoldsve1 people play other games. And can play this game casually instead of full time dedicated.
[2023-01-10 00:21:17] <Shurkeckt> They jumped in about 2 years ago and love it - maybe not as much as me but I'll take it
[2023-01-10 00:21:31] <%dcirusc30> the trees not even that bad to understand =\
[2023-01-10 00:21:40] <arnoldsve1> @rabidwombats i mean i play 3 games but sometimes i just go and abouse poe crack
[2023-01-10 00:21:55] <Shurkeckt> I never told them to play it - I let them ask me questions and drew them in over time :P
[2023-01-10 00:22:08] <%majesticdolphin> TL is great because i can use leapslam as a main dps skill
[2023-01-10 00:22:11] <+greasey1> poe is content overload they gonna have to address that eventually
[2023-01-10 00:22:17] <Jukage01> all my friends are fps gamers or mmo they dont like this lvl of grinding games i guess Smadge
[2023-01-10 00:22:22] <%+rabidwombats> @arnoldsve1 I would say that you don't casually play this game then :P And that's ok. But some people do

[2023-01-10 18:36:13] <%halowedy> the thing that tilts me the most from reddit, is they saying that they feel forced to follow the "poe meta" when you know they always quit before red maps
[2023-01-10 18:36:14] <bstardpriest> @Keyzlll___ sounds good, i would also recommend to follow a build guide. A google search will do a lot

[2023-01-10 18:37:59] <Akanta__> c0refreAk nah, pretty sure empy just noticed the huge decline in viewers so he was gonna play this league no matter what

[2023-01-10 20:58:17] <rixaN_> 30 div gets you maybe 1 ashes

[2023-01-10 20:58:58] <Hzk1102> @rixaN_ why?
[2023-01-10 20:59:00] <VaporeonThighs> aul´s uprising grace is the cheap ashes for this build
[2023-01-10 20:59:13] <rixaN_> because you'd just do a build that does 4x as much damage and sacrifices survivability
[2023-01-10 20:59:19] <rixaN_> since you get 6 portals
[2023-01-10 20:59:27] <%$junkie67> play a bad build, have a bad time
[2023-01-10 20:59:36] <Hzk1102> @rixaN_ this build don't have enough dmg?

[2023-01-10 21:01:03] <rixaN_> this is a good build
[2023-01-10 21:01:06] <rixaN_> especially for HC
[2023-01-10 21:01:14] <rixaN_> but if youre playing SC you can do something that approximates this without the cost
[2023-01-10 21:01:20] <rixaN_> because again, you dont need survivability
