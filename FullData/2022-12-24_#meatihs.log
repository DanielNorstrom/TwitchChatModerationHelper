[2022-12-24 14:49:24] <+kingliar> 1st expansion after rotation is always decent because power level is lower
[2022-12-24 14:49:26] <g0thbaddie> drek thar wouldn't even be broken right now
[2022-12-24 14:49:35] <johnnygmtg1987> the drek thar days lol took them 8 months to nerf it a week before it rotated right? or is it still legal atm?
[2022-12-24 14:49:38] <g0thbaddie> you have to trade so much and it makes a good aggro deck
[2022-12-24 14:49:41] <g0thbaddie> no jace
[2022-12-24 14:49:42] <cizuss> @g0thbaddie i think i disagree with that
[2022-12-24 14:49:50] <cizuss> drek'thar would most definitely be op right now
[2022-12-24 14:49:50] <+BoltharHS> Having a relevant aggro deck was good for the game, and it was cheap, anyone could afford it
[2022-12-24 14:50:03] <g0thbaddie> @cizuss have you seen what rogue and priest can do

[2022-12-24 14:50:24] <!+Shorteracesobad> no good agro deck = full combo decks :(
[2022-12-24 14:50:31] <+BoltharHS> @johnnygmtg1987 It’s still in standard, they nerfed it after only 5 months.

[2022-12-24 15:05:00] <g0thbaddie> @stillnotking75 having aggro be umplayable for months was trash for the game. why should people start with an ice mage secret
[2022-12-24 15:05:00] <Richiegree> You can play your favorite old decks, you’ll just lose with them

[2022-12-24 15:05:17] <altec_____> thats an subjective perception

[2022-12-24 15:05:43] <stillnotking75> aggro wasn't unplayable ever, no idea what you're talking about. aggro druid was always one of the top decks in the meta. implock. curselock. pure pally. etc.
[2022-12-24 15:05:53] <Richiegree> They should have a wild for,at where you can only play cards that were in standard together at some point
[2022-12-24 15:05:54] <johnnygmtg1987> dont you just die every game of wild on turn 4?

[2022-12-24 16:30:17] <+Moophisto> I kind of picture DH as being a weapon based class ideally, trading its life but recouping based on lifesteal, as opposed to like warrior which mitigates the loss by armor
[2022-12-24 16:30:19] <@%pocket_train> You developed tempo while removing the opponent's

[2022-12-24 19:42:29] <Vengeance_88> Classic mode should be a middle ground of standard and wild. Like rotated expansion of the last two years could be played
[2022-12-24 19:42:33] <!+shanevapid> I don’t know why people are using Classic mode to run bots. Maybe xp farming. Maybe Blizz put them there so there isn’t 45 minute queue times in their dead format.
