[2022-12-07 10:04:30] <+Neba_Chan> honestly....that sounds a lot like my route, minus the asmr! I put off trying to do vtubing for a few years because of that. it took me realizing how big and supportive the indie vtubing community was for me to finally get off my booty. my biggest fear was that I was transgender and the stereotype of the bubbly, high-ptiched kawaii or unhinged voice. I found so many lovely people of different identities and presentations and I was like "....oh....this is doable"

[2022-12-07 10:26:07] <+Koko_Nyx> do you have any art or skills Maki?
[2022-12-07 10:26:50] <FloofyMaki> The issue for me is thru experience I have learned I can't work in any capacity. Max I can do is 3 months every several years. The societal expectations and pressures and responsibilities cause a feedback loop of stress that triggers my sensory overload and shutdown. My last job I almost ran out the door and down the street in a frenzy.
[2022-12-07 10:27:03] <+Koko_Nyx> also depends on where you live too. some places have better service but higher rnets. and vice versa

[2022-12-07 10:35:28] <FloofyMaki> I've heard alot of autistc ppl be succesful. And I've met alot like me where we can't just work for the life of us and struggle to get disability to be able to exist. We really need a reform of welfare to help everyone who needs help like us.
[2022-12-07 10:35:36] <%MunchMeisterVT> @koko_nyx yep ADHD or autism masking, I only started to figure it out after I read up on that

[2022-12-07 10:37:34] <%MunchMeisterVT> @floofymaki I agree and that's why I'm an advocate for that kind of social welfare and reform, I don't really talk about that online much cuz yeah, but unfortunately for the meantime we have to make do somehow. as far as I've seen there's quite some ppl on the spectrum I know of or heard of who are "successful", I personally don't know how to do the same but I hope some of their stories can be inspirational, like my music teacher for example
[2022-12-07 10:37:54] <+Koko_Nyx> like unknown medical issues can mask or contribute too. like I have POTS and any amount fo stress or pain triggers my brian to dump massive amounts of adreniline into my system. adrenaline dumps can shoot hr up and soemtimes can feel like anxiety and panic attacks
[2022-12-07 10:38:04] <+Koko_Nyx> I refreshed and it's working good for me now

[2022-12-07 10:41:37] <cherrimode> personally it's the fact that I'm not interested in anyone else. I never go out and date. I just get homies. Get a good vibe and before I know it feelings
[2022-12-07 10:41:47] <FloofyMaki> @MunchMeisterVT They are inspirational stories. But I am aware of my limitations my autism gives me. Stuff I really can't get around lest I face really bad experiences. The end of my last job I was just a crying panicking mess and called out on 90% of my shifts if I went I knew I would run down the street. Then I tried volunteer work a few months later I could only get to 1-2 hours a day from a planned 4hrs. It was a attempt at vocational rehabilitation, the results were quite clear to me.
[2022-12-07 10:42:28] <FloofyMaki> My sensory overloads I've luckily never ran from somewhere, but I've nearly regressed all the way back into my mind.
[2022-12-07 10:42:44] <cherrimode> I do have other friends, it's just we're not as close as me and my best friend are BUT recently I have been talking to others more whenever I have free time outside of school

[2022-12-07 12:50:07] <SeenConnroy> "Too long" The only correct answer.

[2022-12-07 12:50:39] <haides_hullabaloo> It's gonna be modded, and I'm trying to put together the best combination of mods so it probably won't be done for a while
[2022-12-07 12:50:46] <SeenConnroy> NOOOOO
[2022-12-07 12:50:51] <SeenConnroy> I'm so sorry for you.
