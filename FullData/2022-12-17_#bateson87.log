[2022-12-17 11:06:40] <TasosP23> Morning all pepeJAM
[2022-12-17 11:07:00] <!%Merk708> Green/yellow is normally a chest infection
[2022-12-17 11:07:09] <$stuartjamess88> 81 pace on a right back is no good lol
[2022-12-17 11:07:11] <%taily2020> One of the first signs of a cold is green or yellow mucus. It's no reason for concern, and in fact, it means your body is working extra hard to fight off infection. White blood cells rush to battle infection, and when they've done their job, they get flushed out of the body along with the virus.
[2022-12-17 11:07:13] <%joshfishwick24> Otamendi?

[2022-12-17 11:40:56] <%taily2020> It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men. Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness.26 Mar 2022
