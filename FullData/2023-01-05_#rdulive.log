[2023-01-05 13:22:27] <%+Nasrim667> Your decisions for triples into 4s today feel weird. I think you are missing out of real win conditions this way for way to less tempo you gain with the 4s.

[2023-01-05 15:45:54] <+missingever> not worth for 5 gold
[2023-01-05 15:45:58] <+data_rich> 10 rolls to make up the value
[2023-01-05 15:46:00] <%+zzgrinderzz> no reason to level
[2023-01-05 15:46:00] <FrayedRigging> you get 1 golds worth every 6 taverns
[2023-01-05 15:46:06] <xenoSEaf> @RduLIVE you get upr frog chances lower, maaan
[2023-01-05 15:46:07] <%Theogritzi> @rdulive u should of picked leeroy, he had the quilboar taunt

[2023-01-05 15:46:13] <CoCoECW> Its still efficient if you are looking for multiple units from lower tavern tiers
[2023-01-05 15:46:26] <+staylowest> highmane better

[2023-01-05 15:46:44] <coby04> How big is the ZAP?
[2023-01-05 15:46:48] <mr_bouke> 5 gold is 25 minions so by leveling you need to roll 25 to get the money back, not accounting for worthless 6 drops in the tavern

[2023-01-05 16:06:23] <%chrisdubnbass> @Yobimapi HDT is way faster than firestone but doesn't record fights and doesn't have a simulator, it shows a bit more accurate percentages from what i've noticed though

[2023-01-05 16:08:39] <Dr_Brian> @Yobimapi shady uses decktracker and he says it's less taxing on his comp, so I guess it still applies. I'm not a fan of decktracker ui though, firestone clearly did a better job on the aesthetic part

[2023-01-05 17:34:29] <@^Streamlabs> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2023-01-05 17:54:34] <+princle> @quixoticpragmatic and @naturebeardguy since I asked the question here is my understanding. You buy a minion in the tavern and play an omega-uther on it that sets its stats to 100/100. no other buffs or heropowers. Just pure minion fight. My conclusion is that bronze warden wins almost every time except when coiler summons leroy and something tht summons.

Gus was so powerful he could create new emotes and gambas out of thin air. He had access to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. HmmmDeath The only thing he was afraid of was losing all his channel points, which eventually, he did. He taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice robbed him in his sleep. pepeLost Ironic. He could save others, but not himself.
