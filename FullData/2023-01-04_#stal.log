[2023-01-04 17:06:42] <%triomino_guy> from their perspective the game has been doing better than ever since shb so this is probably the direction for the forseeable future
[2023-01-04 17:06:47] <+WadeSlilson> the unfortunate part IMO is that EVERY job is being made simple, i dont mind simple jobs if there are also more complex ones for people who want that

[2023-01-04 17:08:11] <+WadeSlilson> yeah, i would have liked to see them lean more into the team aspect of aggro
[2023-01-04 17:08:22] <%OdinDuh> its prob to let dps go all out
[2023-01-04 17:08:22] <ThiccB0i_> Now enmity is just tank stance toggle
[2023-01-04 17:08:32] <+WadeSlilson> i think it was troubled because ninja had most of the tools, but if they had given other jobs their own tools to help with aggro it would've been fine IMO
[2023-01-04 17:08:33] <%+NopeBadguy> it's bc people don't fucking press quelling strikes
[2023-01-04 17:08:33] <%Frostieblade> i mean even the tanks dont have to do much outside of swaps just turn it on and attack KEKW
[2023-01-04 17:08:48] <%+NopeBadguy> or diversion

[2023-01-04 17:09:09] <%+NopeBadguy> and then blame the tank
[2023-01-04 17:09:12] <%OdinDuh> but i feel like wow style of aggro managment prob made it more complexed but theres a line that its just there cosmetically if ppl can just ignore it after a toggle

[2023-01-04 17:52:09] <%OdinDuh> most of the appeal for ai vtuber is for viewers to try to test and break their limits and getting them to say funny stuff
[2023-01-04 17:52:16] <JustAOrangeWall> thats what I mean, the group behind AI will have to set the settings to make it intentionally imperfect
