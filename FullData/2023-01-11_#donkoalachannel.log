[2023-01-11 12:05:36] <Inhimilis> Minced meat should have a fat content from 15-25%
[2023-01-11 12:05:47] <$IggyTheIncubus> Speaking as an American @DonKoalaChannel I can confirm we pump almost as much shit into our meat as we do into our congress (political jokes HA!), and that when people come to America they get fatter. When they leave they lose the weight. They don't change diet or exercise habits at all either before coming to America or after leaving. So it has to be something in the food

[2023-01-11 12:48:50] <CaptJonesVT> I'd say have a strap going from your shoulder down, that way you dont make your waist so busy

[2023-01-11 12:49:10] <$IggyTheIncubus> ACTUALLY IDEA
[2023-01-11 12:49:35] <$IggyTheIncubus> Have an under-armpit holster with gun. It's only visible when your jacket is off. Concealed carry, BITCHES

[2023-01-11 12:50:53] <$IggyTheIncubus> Though if it was a real trenchcoat it would be down to your ankles shorty
[2023-01-11 12:51:16] <$IggyTheIncubus> I'll look for designs of underarm holsters that I think would work
[2023-01-11 12:51:18] <@%$onyx_ium> a lab coat would be more stylish Kappa
