[2023-01-09 17:51:21] <%+GHOSTEDonline> vaping should be cheaper, technically it could not even be a tobacco product
[2023-01-09 17:51:23] <+sacredqte> dont the goverment want the money from the taxes though? if people quit theres no more money
[2023-01-09 17:51:39] <%+TheJuan> ive been making them myself
[2023-01-09 17:52:02] <%+TheJuan> its a little annoying untill u find the right flavor
[2023-01-09 17:52:05] <+sacredqte> @TheJuan as far as ive seen they are increasing the prices for the nicotine itself not just the pre made stuff

[2023-01-09 17:56:03] <+sacredqte> the nicotine bases themselves are doubled in price from the law passing but not the stuff without nicotine  so if i were to buy the stuff i usually get it would be 2.5 the price or something

[2023-01-09 18:24:07] <%+alex__gfy> but in the future when they change the meter generation its roughly a 10% increase

[2023-01-09 18:26:15] <%+alex__gfy> they changed the generation of hawk meter to "x amount of meter per hit" to something that you have to upkeep like a buff

[2023-01-09 18:27:11] <%+alex__gfy> but it effectively makes the DS build very clunky and almost impossible to play well

[2023-01-09 21:17:31] <+KaiBeGone> boser used like 12 selectors on galatur for the full set
[2023-01-09 21:18:04] <%givemebeer_> nice thing about three umars is you can go with defensive cards for other 3

[2023-01-09 21:20:15] <KoJack92> there's a lot of classes that have elemental conversion through tripods
[2023-01-09 21:20:52] <+KaiBeGone> not really for zerk, but all her animations were pure flames everywhere so if shes alemental her damage will be crazy
[2023-01-09 21:21:08] <%givemebeer_> I'm six galaturs away from finishing off three umars but still need 7 beatrices HmmmKay
[2023-01-09 21:21:22] <+Darnokk_> What about GL/Destroyer? I saw that Vairgrys is part of a frontal attack card set (like Umars), but we cant get it yet. Can they run Lazenith + Vairgrys?
