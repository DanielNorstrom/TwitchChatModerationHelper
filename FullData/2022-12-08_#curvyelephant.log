Then last month I received a package from a different company (but is associated with the original app) out of the blue.

If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.

[2022-12-08 18:10:10] <Oh_no_melon> So the thing with Christianity, is that practicing numbers are remaining consistent. Which means that there are the same number of people practicing now as there was 60 years ago
