[2023-01-09 16:26:55] <%BDESAMA> @BDESAMA Masturbation does not seem to have any long-lasting effects on testosterone levels. However, masturbation may have short-term effects on the levels of this hormone. It also affects other factors, such as sex drive. Masturbation does not typically pose a threat to any other aspects of a person's physical health

[2023-01-09 18:12:26] <%sunfyre_08> Sweetners trigger insulin responses much stronger than regular sugar. so your cells take up more glucose from your blood. thats why you will get fat eventhough it has no calories.

[2023-01-09 21:43:11] <%fireball_125> @Spear_Shot a few days ago i played it for 7 hours straight, its really enjoyable actually. The only thing i dislike it that you have to level up at a certain part of the story because sometimes you're not strong enough or have the required materials to get the XP needed. all in all the game is really good
[2023-01-09 21:43:14] <deadlyshov3l> Hi boss ! @Spear_Shot
[2023-01-09 21:43:18] <!%+imCrylad> @J_Z_R sponsor BatChest
[2023-01-09 21:43:23] <@%CrazyOtto_> @d15cipl3 it all has to do with how its optimized. the same reason many games run better on GameCube than emulated on my 3080
[2023-01-09 21:43:38] <darbyryder> @j_z_r  it's a sponsor really proud of him
[2023-01-09 21:43:38] <@%android18_> the game is v good
