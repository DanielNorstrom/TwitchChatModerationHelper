[2023-01-10 16:19:37] <SoEmpty322> win in 30 mins is still a loss
[2023-01-10 16:19:43] <SoEmpty322> so its better to concede LUL
[2023-01-10 16:20:00] <Darkzero_sdz> spread him harder Madge
[2023-01-10 16:20:00] <%namebannedmeelmo> depends on if you stream or not KEKW
[2023-01-10 16:20:14] <macko222> if he didn't have faelin it could have been a win
