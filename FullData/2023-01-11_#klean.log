[2023-01-11 14:29:45] <BubrZabujca> @Klean there is a rule that everything is bad except me, i am perfect and need no change. thats most of the ppl that complain too much
[2023-01-11 14:29:49] <%+Laplacesbox> Awesome changes in my opinion
[2023-01-11 14:29:58] <+fullerk55> also hiked up PK prices for the good ammo by quite a bit
[2023-01-11 14:30:01] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Klean What if they did allow you to get high-tier items, but it doesn't occur with each reset, but only very rarely, in limited quantity, and with high barter/ruble cost?
[2023-01-11 14:30:03] <+kickasskirk95> The longer the game stays like early wipe the better imo
[2023-01-11 14:30:12] <+MemesMckenzie> would be fun to even have events later in wipe where they maybe become available for a short time
[2023-01-11 14:30:13] <+jasp3rs> Though, I think even the headsets are a bit OP and shouldn't be as available.

[2023-01-11 14:34:10] <%+dess1m> i hope that they redo the hideout crafts if theyre going this route with the ammo. waiting 12-15 hours for 80-150 rounds is pretty lame.

[2023-01-11 14:37:55] <%+succulenthamm> I just ran into the quest cooldown (24 hr between gunsmith 5 and 6) and I just don't get what the they are going for. The hideout already consumes a lot of time, this is just turning it more towards a mobile esque game. The sweaties are already going to pass me and I don't care, this just more limits what I, as a casual, can and can't do and it's getting frustrating.

[2023-01-11 14:39:03] <SparkPJ> when tarkov gets stale, what do you play?
[2023-01-11 14:39:07] <SparkPJ> or do you just play tarkov?
[2023-01-11 14:39:15] <%+Mischowski> yeah you can't balance a game around 1-2% of the playerbase
[2023-01-11 14:39:15] <+connfus3d> Like 5% of the player base probably hits 40 in a wipe lol
[2023-01-11 14:39:18] <TrashPandacoot> well try playing on servers with desmond LUL
[2023-01-11 14:39:21] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @SparkPJ He plays a variety of games.
[2023-01-11 14:39:24] <%AntiParagon> The first week there is probably more cheaters than level 40s.
[2023-01-11 14:39:31] <+supershotgun_gaming> I'm 24 and I mostyl meet 20-25 players
[2023-01-11 14:39:32] <%+succulenthamm> No but making me wait to do shit is affecting me with my little time I have. and my point is, these people are already going to be ahead of me.
[2023-01-11 14:39:35] <SparkPJ> @5cavlive5matt3r oh thats nice to hear :D
[2023-01-11 14:39:35] [Raid] 4 raiders from MOGOXX have joined!
[2023-01-11 14:39:39] <%Gelrandil> i think the average pmc i run into is 20 ish levels
[2023-01-11 14:39:41] <%ForsaikenRedskye> when tarkov gets stale, don't play tarkov till mid wipe next wipe.
[2023-01-11 14:39:41] <!%Veritas> Tarkov is the only game where people want the progression scaled based on calendar time elapsed since an update rather than time spent playing
[2023-01-11 14:40:00] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @SparkPJ Usually Tarkov for the first few weeks then he explores more games.
[2023-01-11 14:40:08] <Drizzt___> thx for ruining the game

[2023-01-11 14:44:17] <dmitrybeard> I had a raid yesterday where I survived several firefights. Level 4 armor actually saved my life, the fights took time and skill, not just brrrrr the whole mag with 0 recoil. Game became more enjoyable

[2023-01-11 14:44:24] <%5cavlive5matt3r> I mean isn't this supposed to be a survivalist game where you use what you find rather than what you buy? 🤔
[2023-01-11 14:44:28] <!%Veritas> problem for me is my stash is full of garbage I gotta sell so I can buy kits so when I inevitably die it doesnt take a year to get ready for my duo
[2023-01-11 14:44:30] <iinzightz> some streamers are just at fault wioth the toxicness
[2023-01-11 14:44:36] <dchop> can we agree that player scavs are on streets way too early in the raid
[2023-01-11 14:44:36] <tsiigaaja> @dmitrybeard Thats how it should be <3

[2023-01-11 14:45:43] <iinzightz> making a game needlessly grindy is also not good tho
[2023-01-11 14:45:44] <wxesly> Can someone explain to me how the changes impact lower level and higher level players lol I haven’t played yet this wipe
[2023-01-11 14:45:45] <ch3kla> bro i died 5 times in a row day time at spawn with shitty bullets with a spray from 500m in the chest cheaters still kill u ammo does not matter

[2023-01-11 14:45:57] <%5cavlive5matt3r> I actually think relying more on finding hte items in raid makes the game more fair.
[2023-01-11 14:45:59] <+fullerk55> But you mean to tell me the Make X million roubles in an hour on X map doesnt work?xD

[2023-01-11 14:46:24] <%+SummitVotedTrump> @Zhamereak RIGHT
[2023-01-11 14:46:27] <RyguT> did you use a keybind to drop the bullet at chamber?
[2023-01-11 14:46:33] <de_pressed02> that pmc's gonna flip when he sees a scav with bp took him out
[2023-01-11 14:46:34] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @luminhardt they do, i don’t use it because i never remember but it would be nice to be able to have like all AP and 1 standard mag for scavs and stuff idk. Not sure how useful it would be

[2023-01-11 14:47:18] <dmitrybeard> also this wipe Im meeting only friendly player scavs. everyone sharing loot, showing you where you can find dead bodies of pmcs and letting you loot them. it feels nice and how it should be
[2023-01-11 14:47:18] <LabMade> @RyguT alt or ctrl + R i cant remember
[2023-01-11 14:47:19] <$Prolapsed> I'm cool with meta ammo being removed from traders, but that's not what they've done, they've left it at level 4 for the chads, givng them an extra advantage, just make it FIR, go in raid if you want it
[2023-01-11 14:47:51] <%+luminhardt> @GL0CKenspeil ahh cool good to know, i personally can see it being very useful so i wouldnt mind a change like that

[2023-01-11 14:47:57] <!%Veritas> the community being in "a bad state" is not the same as saying everyone in the community is bad

[2023-01-11 14:48:02] <%+succulenthamm> I'm negative about the mobile game part of this (the time waiting for quests, crafts etc) and that's literally it lol.

[2023-01-11 14:48:40] <%Gavlakel> very sad mentality
[2023-01-11 14:48:41] <bendazdenda> The problem is that a lot of people started coming to complain into the mems subreddit as well kekw

[2023-01-11 14:49:08] <eliokast> If BSG gave them a $100 bill in an envelope those bastards would complain about the way the bill is folded.
[2023-01-11 14:49:11] <BreeZaHGG> i think bsg are the best developers in the world and made a unique game that only hardcore gamers like myself can understand

[2023-01-11 14:49:36] <dmitrybeard> its incredible how tarkov becomes more enjoyable when you stop listening to toxic opinions on forums and just listen to your feelings about the game.

[2023-01-11 14:50:23] <%j4rra> People in the Tarkov discord were complaining about the ammo changes yesterday saying this makes it harder for everyone except for players who play a lot
[2023-01-11 14:50:32] <7rav7> @Klean I think you underestimate how frustrated many people are due to the issues with a)performance and b)cheating in this game. Thus the increasing frustration and toxicity. Cheers
[2023-01-11 14:50:36] <@$JoshuaGuzz> When a community gets too large, it's almost impossible to stop the massive amount of toxicity
[2023-01-11 14:50:40] <iinzightz> no the issues come from the streamers and then the comjunity take it and start the toxicness
[2023-01-11 14:50:44] <stellarb> 🦀  meta ammo gone

[2023-01-11 14:52:16] <SomaVision> Why cant all high tier ammo/armor just be found in raid only. Why is there even a market for it. Should be stuff that you severely want for your  character. Everything is about roubles in this game
[2023-01-11 14:52:20] <azncrackheadenergy> @Klean can us aussies even play on USA servers anymore ? didnt bsg region lock us ?
[2023-01-11 14:52:27] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @iinzightz being annoyed is understandable, but complaining and starting drama isn’t.

[2023-01-11 14:52:37] <+yelaa44> been playing since 2017/18. most addicted I've ever been to the game this wipe @klean  love that mid tier ammo is being used more. makes for more fun exchanges. love all the things they're aiming for.
[2023-01-11 14:52:41] <iinzightz> @Vodal3g people can still be annoyed they havent fixed bugs
[2023-01-11 14:52:46] <hemmo> Complaining solves nothing, if there's bugs or issues report them and move on idk why people are so pressed about it
[2023-01-11 14:52:46] <8bitsrebel> when you have that mentality like beeing negative all the time you wont get good i realised that myself after bitching for a long time i relaxed now ohhh and no shit o popped off

[2023-01-11 14:54:16] <+Wistful_Ennui> Looks more like a lego build than a gun mod interface
[2023-01-11 14:54:17] <iinzightz> aparently BSG have removed items from traders that dont even spawn in game like cmon peopel gonna have issues wioth that
[2023-01-11 14:54:24] <!%Veritas> @Klean if I hop in the shower and get on in a bit you down to play?
[2023-01-11 14:54:26] <trololololololsaurus> @azncrackheadenergy yeah man they locked us out pepehands
[2023-01-11 14:54:31] <+Mahky> I wonder if they will ever add in offline raids with limited loot pools

[2023-01-11 14:54:51] <Zhamereak> Any plans on playing with smoke any time soon?
[2023-01-11 14:54:55] <iinzightz> @GL0CKenspeil when BSG removed items from traders that dont even spawn in raid, people aint gonna speak highly of them
[2023-01-11 14:54:57] <$BigKingLuigi> @Mahky probably never
[2023-01-11 14:54:58] <+iByt3__> @AntiParagon that\s way to meta for me to think about/  :-)

[2023-01-11 14:56:35] <Vodal3g> @iinzightz are you still playing the game ? clearly are get over it every game has bugs. either play it or dont dude
[2023-01-11 14:56:37] <youngmanjoel> is the best way to do hideout just buy everything on flea?
[2023-01-11 14:56:42] <ohelloteam> @iinzightz why cry

[2023-01-11 14:56:57] <%darcss> it spawns in labs
[2023-01-11 14:57:04] <+strictrooster> @Klean i think the ammo change would have been better if they had done it day one of wipe along with making some higher armor harder to obtain so people wouldnt have been as mad
[2023-01-11 14:57:06] <@$JoshuaGuzz> @yelaa44 Used to* yes

[2023-01-11 14:57:31] <iinzightz> @GL0CKenspeil a lot later wipe, they add items to the game and removed them without them even spawning, just shows the kind oif team theyre.
[2023-01-11 14:57:31] <+yelaa44> ah true! get back into it @joshuaguzz that shit was fire!
[2023-01-11 14:57:33] <Chulubbz> ive had such bad luck with hideout items this wipe :(

[2023-01-11 14:58:01] <iNooKii> Its done. Stop complaining about day one or not. Just play ur game and enjoy it :D
[2023-01-11 14:58:06] <iinzightz> amm ochanges are great, just removing gear that doesnt even spawn comes across so amateur
[2023-01-11 14:58:06] <%+barweniasty> Hello
[2023-01-11 14:58:07] <+strictrooster> @klean i agree my gripe here is just that why the good armor is still so easy to get kinda offbalances the change a bit
[2023-01-11 14:58:08] <madski9> Kind of sucks for the casual player base tho

[2023-01-11 14:58:49] <iinzightz> @Koffiekoekje it just shows how little they thought it through, so easy to just add a spawn instead of remvoing items without even checking

[2023-01-11 14:59:28] <Nuljern> to be fair, if you get ruined a raid because of a cheater it's not the same as a none streamer, cause we don't get that much time to game, so you can't just shut up play another raid.
[2023-01-11 14:59:29] <+3gloo> what happened?

[2023-01-11 15:00:32] <@$JoshuaGuzz> @CrypticSoldier Every 1.0 you go up your Scav spawns with better stuff and your cooldown on it gets lower, prices of paid extracts goes down, and when you hit 6.0 you get access to his secret max level trader menu where you can get really cool shit for cheap

[2023-01-11 15:00:53] <%Koffiekoekje> @iinzightz I wouldn't do that since it's arguably the best helmet in the game, it needs to be rare

[2023-01-11 15:01:22] <+GTXWarrior> Is aim and recoil really based on RPG stats in this game?

[2023-01-11 15:01:47] <NeLZi94> yeah agree
[2023-01-11 15:01:50] <%+succulenthamm> The meta for recoil should be mastery
[2023-01-11 15:01:52] <@%Mrshilka> or muzzlebreaks
[2023-01-11 15:01:55] <%5cavlive5matt3r> Maybe add more subsonic ammunition?
[2023-01-11 15:01:59] <$Joemonk3y> I think adding a mini-quest on every raid load in would be neat, like as you spawn in something like "extract with yellow pliers for an xp bonus"
[2023-01-11 15:02:03] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @iinzightz does them removing the ryst actually effect you and the majority of players though? Like how many people actually bought those and now can’t
[2023-01-11 15:02:04] <Syracusefinest> I can’t play anymore without unaffecting my fov lol
[2023-01-11 15:02:12] <+SwipMeister> what is the main source for these stealth changes, kinda annoying they depend on streamers for spreading that information? not throwing any flak just genuinely wondering where people get their information asap after a change is made
[2023-01-11 15:02:12] <%5cavlive5matt3r> Correct.
[2023-01-11 15:02:19] <Calciio> add smellovision
[2023-01-11 15:02:20] <@%Mrshilka> subsonics also should be much weaker with pen
[2023-01-11 15:02:23] <tsiigaaja> That would be so much work for the audio team but worth it
[2023-01-11 15:02:31] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Mrshilka Correct
[2023-01-11 15:02:35] <devdariani11> Bro its just a game its dont need to be that realistic
[2023-01-11 15:02:37] <@%+fortburke> @Mrshilka Pog
[2023-01-11 15:02:39] <+CrabtreeMotorsports> some suppressors reduce just as much recoil as a standard muzzle break
[2023-01-11 15:02:47] <%5cavlive5matt3r> F
[2023-01-11 15:02:47] <iinzightz> @GL0CKenspeil no the issue is them just doing things half arsed, the issue is they remove items without even checking their spawn % not that they took items, which is needed 100%
[2023-01-11 15:02:47] <madski9> I don’t echo anyone
[2023-01-11 15:02:48] <%+strictrooster> @Klean on that point i completely agree the subs should be the ones that are quiet
[2023-01-11 15:02:49] <salgolkin> @Klean ill be excited when you guns dont sound like a bag of bolts when just walking down a high way
[2023-01-11 15:02:50] <the_berv> Anyone else get a new gun for Christmas?
[2023-01-11 15:02:52] <@%Mrshilka> @devdariani11 wut
[2023-01-11 15:02:53] <zzzlewzzz> bad timing
[2023-01-11 15:02:55] <zzzlewzzz> omg

[2023-01-11 15:03:13] <shaybra> they've probably been working on that for a while now tho because we've been talking about the suppressor thing for a while @Klean and I am sure we're heard right?
[2023-01-11 15:03:15] <+TheBigDaddyDiesel> kleanSquirt kleanSplat
[2023-01-11 15:03:17] <%SimbaYugen> @darcss it pretty flexible you can go mascots or bruisers for frontline. If you have Annie with spark and sun fire it Carries you so far
[2023-01-11 15:03:21] <%+ll_DMC_ll> sprinting should cancel actions
[2023-01-11 15:03:27] <stinkhat> just like real life when you have to commit to surgeries Sadge
[2023-01-11 15:03:28] <%spiritsoftheforrest> Morning yall kleanSmokin
[2023-01-11 15:03:29] <%+ll_DMC_ll> or something else atleast
[2023-01-11 15:03:30] <jmac8675309> the good ol days of no med animations
[2023-01-11 15:03:32] <lentini72> 100% should be able to cancel animations, I agree
[2023-01-11 15:03:33] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @iinzightz I get that but when it comes down to the impact it has on your gameplay, does it actually effect you?
[2023-01-11 15:03:33] <PrimeHunter02> you should beable to cancel but it drops the item on the ground
[2023-01-11 15:03:34] <+SwipMeister> stage reloads when
[2023-01-11 15:03:35] <dchop> @Klean shouldnt you be able to click and instantly be able to sprint? i thought that was how the mechanic worked?
[2023-01-11 15:03:37] <%darcss> @SimbaYugen oh yeah they did buff annie u right
[2023-01-11 15:03:39] <cruzo> I always choose my lip chap over surviving gunfire
[2023-01-11 15:03:43] <+samavaya> yeah just drop the item/goldenstar and get your gun back up
[2023-01-11 15:03:53] <nedscorpio> im triggered
[2023-01-11 15:03:55] <@%Mrshilka> welp being mortars while taking a dump, just gotta sit here and finish my dump and not runf or cvover
[2023-01-11 15:04:00] <%+SaturniLuna> You may be dead, but your lips are gorgeous @Klean
[2023-01-11 15:04:01] <%darcss> @SimbaYugen i ma try running that rn as i watch
[2023-01-11 15:04:04] <+XL_Beany> Would be cool if you dropped the item you're holding when shot, maybe level up grip strength to allow you to hold onto it
[2023-01-11 15:04:04] <@$JoshuaGuzz> Unlucky
[2023-01-11 15:04:06] <+oshin1> shoreline has been chewing me up and spitting me out
[2023-01-11 15:04:09] <%+strictrooster> @Klean me and my mates have joked around that they should add a yeeting animation if you need to cancel something in hurry
[2023-01-11 15:04:15] <%+DeehzyOG> Theres like 15 times less things you can get stuck doing though in BB
[2023-01-11 15:04:17] <Syracusefinest> Should be you got spooked and dropped your GS wherever you decided to cancel the animation. That’d be cool
[2023-01-11 15:04:18] <+TheBigDaddyDiesel> Getting shot? I gotta finish putting my chapstick on
[2023-01-11 15:04:23] <iinzightz> @GL0CKenspeil yes because its the same devs making the game lol, it just shows how they doing things half arsed which is a red flag
[2023-01-11 15:04:28] <chickenmode10> Love the streams but I don't think I've seen you go one without complaining about something OMEGALUL <3
[2023-01-11 15:04:28] <Nuljern> you mad at the game, ironic when considering what you said before the raid.
[2023-01-11 15:04:30] <%Ravejeuit> you never survive this whit good animation that man love the bushes
[2023-01-11 15:04:30] <%SimbaYugen> @darcss broken trusttt but you gotta get a spark or it’s shit
[2023-01-11 15:04:36] <+RebelFoxtrot> There is no emergency actions, it's so annoying.
