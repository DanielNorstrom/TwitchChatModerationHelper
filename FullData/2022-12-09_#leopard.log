[2022-12-09 15:21:37] <@%^Nightbot> Worth is different to everyone. Some people value loot. Some people value missions. So people want 40 hours of content. Some people would be happy with 2. Measuring "worth" for a specific person is determined by their preferences and what they enjoy, which means there is no universal answer to 'is it worth it'.  For what it's "worth", so far Leopard is enjoying Witch Queen content more than Beyond Light because Savathun > Eramis.

[2022-12-09 15:59:00] <%+x_Mechanize_x> @Vathris14 We still have a handful more, I think are probably in the dungeon. Not sure if placing them in the HELM is just a triumph like the bobble heads, or maybe we get a weapon drop or something. imsdSHRUG

[2022-12-09 18:06:22] <%coconutmigrates> Fallen Sunstar + Ionic Trace fragments + double bomber + storm grenade = a pretty good neutral game loop. Issue is, if you accidentally break the loop, you're screwed.

[2022-12-09 18:07:47] <%+Serthren> Going through 2 programs probably messes it up. Going into VoiceMod, then into Discord with it's own compression/affects on it
