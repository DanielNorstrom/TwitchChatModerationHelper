[2023-01-07 09:20:55] <ti3nar> my friend only enjoys gacha if they have pvp,im the opposite way
[2023-01-07 09:20:56] <LS_Degree> Tencent needs it all and Mihoyo is ruining that
[2023-01-07 09:21:00] <MSDOO7> Tencent is the CCP, so they definetly don't like eachother
[2023-01-07 09:21:19] <%ML_Zahhak> Tencent is definitely the CCPs gaming arm, Mihoyo is a rogue that decided to move their headquarters

[2023-01-07 09:22:11] <MSDOO7> used to be, now definetly not ever since Mihoyo refused to bend over to the CCP
[2023-01-07 09:22:13] <brittis_n3xus> pvp will prolly be time attack like in honkai impact 3rd
[2023-01-07 09:22:14] <TheGameplayHub> out*

[2023-01-07 09:22:26] <%Bolvarin> well constellations could be only pve and disabled in pvp, they have many workarounds for it
[2023-01-07 09:22:35] <%zuyruna> they cant stop putting constelation stuff. even in honkai you need like alot of farm and dupes of the hero to unlock certain talent
[2023-01-07 09:22:51] <Hefflaren> Why is that a thing
[2023-01-07 09:22:54] <Hefflaren> wtf

[2023-01-07 09:23:02] <Xarges> might be too much effort for them to balance pvp idk
[2023-01-07 09:23:07] <LS_Degree> Mihoyo loves PVE story games it seems
[2023-01-07 09:23:14] <%ML_Zahhak> You gotta understand in China Death is a sacred thing so showing the act of dying and skeletons are like porn in the usa, its taboo
[2023-01-07 09:23:16] <%AuKi39> probably don't want any kind of conflict in the country, they want to make a pretty subdued population probably
[2023-01-07 09:23:22] <%Beanflakes> nonnormalized pvp in tof convinces me no pvp in genshin was a good idea
