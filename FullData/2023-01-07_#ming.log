[2023-01-07 07:39:34] <!%gunblade00> Bullying doesn’t just happen to the smallest kid in the class. Children who bully others target those who seem to be less powerful or not as strong. Children who bully others also often target those who seem “different.”

[2023-01-07 07:40:32] <!%gunblade00> Bullying can cause serious, lasting problems, not only for the children who are bullied but also for the children who bully and those who witness bullying. Children who bully others may do so to gain social status or as a reaction to being bullied. Some children with TS may also bully others.
