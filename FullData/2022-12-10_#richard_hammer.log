[2022-12-10 04:43:57] <trashpandab3ar> I ended up with tons of bards as well and had to start turning them away. Was getting non-stop requests to join the colony to entertain
[2022-12-10 04:48:06] <trashpandab3ar> I ended up manually setting all the bards/entertainers as haulers.
[2022-12-10 04:48:14] <trashpandab3ar> I don't want to backseat, but it's possible
[2022-12-10 04:48:37] <ItsHooligan> is this game difficult to get into
[2022-12-10 04:49:09] <ItsHooligan> I mean on a complexity scale
[2022-12-10 04:49:37] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Harder than Mario Kart; easier than Eve Online.

[2022-12-10 05:10:59] <%+Destrina> The true art is convincing other people that the cube is art.

[2022-12-10 06:03:09] <%$DuranDuranDuran> I assume my dude died somehow, cause I ain't seeing him richS
[2022-12-10 06:03:19] <Xenowarrior17> theyre quivering in fear
[2022-12-10 06:03:19] <3rdlevelwizard> Archers are notoriously tricky to set up.
[2022-12-10 06:03:35] <$Negarretep> I see that I'm still alive
[2022-12-10 06:03:40] <$Negarretep> Which is what really matters here

[2022-12-10 06:04:13] <+Azawrath> that stairwell is very heavy use hehe

[2022-12-10 06:09:49] <%Anandil> that child is vicious, fighting a boar
[2022-12-10 06:11:17] <+Esperae> the boar picked the wrong side
[2022-12-10 06:11:50] <%OakmontOwls> so how's the dwarfing? is it better than rim world?
[2022-12-10 06:12:30] <%OakmontOwls> that's fair

[2022-12-10 06:12:44] <FormallyGreen> Rimworld has a win condition
[2022-12-10 06:12:47] <Dadburry> RW and DF are different enough to make comparing them pointless
[2022-12-10 06:14:56] <FormallyGreen> unless youre speed running that is
[2022-12-10 06:15:19] <3rdlevelwizard> All you need on DF is one good industry.
[2022-12-10 06:15:23] <FormallyGreen> dwarf fortress difficulty is very random
[2022-12-10 06:17:32] <%+Impuritan> evening richard and chat

[2022-12-10 06:28:51] <%Erbrand> real sad to see the waterfall not dug to richLUL

[2022-12-10 06:30:15] <$unknownohyeah> right?
[2022-12-10 06:30:27] <$unknownohyeah> like they want to be in it is how i interpreted it
[2022-12-10 06:30:48] <+HoneyMacs> etalyx built near a waterfall too and they seem to like it lol
[2022-12-10 06:30:52] <+HoneyMacs> idk
[2022-12-10 06:31:52] <%Erbrand> do shells actually do anything of value?
[2022-12-10 06:32:15] <%Erbrand> shells into gems?
[2022-12-10 06:32:16] <%Erbrand> that's tight

[2022-12-10 06:51:53] <Xenowarrior17> I feel like they're not really that upset tho only 7 in the bottom two vs 36 in top two
[2022-12-10 06:53:40] <emptyxD> why does that music has rimworld vibes?

[2022-12-10 06:56:52] <smilingowl> i think the lead programmer made them himself
[2022-12-10 06:57:10] <emptyxD> smilingowl really? thats cool :D
[2022-12-10 06:57:15] <FormallyGreen> nah they got help for the steam release
[2022-12-10 06:57:26] <FormallyGreen> they did the original music for the ascii game
[2022-12-10 06:58:47] <emptyxD> good music in any case :D
[2022-12-10 06:59:25] <smilingowl> i locked it up, yes the ascii songs where all made by the lead the designer but for steam they rerecorded them and made new ones with real musicans
[2022-12-10 06:59:53] <+Jabba_64> !please
[2022-12-10 06:59:53] <@^Moobot> @Jabba_64 Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-10 07:00:58] <FormallyGreen> "real" musicians
[2022-12-10 07:01:09] <%$eSaltcracker> I think I found the main difference between rimworld and dwarf fortress, you can build a giant base in df without it ever really lagging, meanwhile rimworld just fucking dies at 100+ people
[2022-12-10 07:01:18] <FormallyGreen> Id say if you make music you're a musician
[2022-12-10 07:01:23] <smilingowl> ya know not a nerd with a guitarre
[2022-12-10 07:01:32] <%HyperStipherX> Yo Dick hope the night's going well
[2022-12-10 07:02:35] <%$eSaltcracker> was it not clock max 10? they need liek 30 from what i saw?
[2022-12-10 07:02:47] <Zencurse> @eSaltcracker Size is relative. I think DF expects your base will always contain larger amounts of people. Meanwhile RM seems to prefer smaller settlements
[2022-12-10 07:03:09] <TraumaTurtleRA> Temperature doesn't really matter in this game, right? Like, when it's snowing outside as an example.
[2022-12-10 07:03:52] <Anongamer> lol LUL
[2022-12-10 07:03:53] <+HoneyMacs> amazing lol

[2022-12-10 07:04:56] <$unknownohyeah> do rivers really freeze over enough to walk on though?
[2022-12-10 07:05:13] <$unknownohyeah> yeah irl
[2022-12-10 07:05:13] <%Dyrk> in reality?

[2022-12-10 07:05:15] <%Dyrk> sure
[2022-12-10 07:05:15] <Zencurse> Man I hope so. Cuz I really wanna buy this game come my next paycheck but I'm scurred x.x @TraumaTurtleRA
[2022-12-10 07:05:25] <$unknownohyeah> idk ive only lived in southern california my whole life lol
[2022-12-10 07:05:25] <Ruinkind> We drive over lakes in northern Canada.  @unknownohyeah
[2022-12-10 07:05:32] <$unknownohyeah> lakes of course
[2022-12-10 07:05:40] <Ruinkind> Not just small cars, commercial trucks.
[2022-12-10 07:05:47] <$unknownohyeah> i was thinking because of the running water it wouldnt freeze thick
[2022-12-10 07:05:47] <Ruinkind> Rivers too, yeah.  People sled on them all the time.
[2022-12-10 07:05:51] <TraumaTurtleRA> @Zencurse Ya, I am not really sure, if I wouldnt be stuck again.... so I didn't buy it.
[2022-12-10 07:06:11] <TrembleNation> ice road truckers
[2022-12-10 07:06:50] <Dadburry> reject language, return to grunts and noises rooG
[2022-12-10 07:07:03] <Zencurse> I've no problem with problem solving. I'm more scared of the interface being obtuse x.x
[2022-12-10 07:07:27] <Ruinkind> I mean, its a old game.  It won't hold your hand and it doesn't have massive QoL.
[2022-12-10 07:07:29] <TraumaTurtleRA> Yea, I think I will get overwhelmed and dont get into the game at all - maybe.
[2022-12-10 07:07:34] <Ruinkind> You gotta kinda like it to put in the effort.
[2022-12-10 07:07:44] <+HoneyMacs> yeah i dont mind the interface
[2022-12-10 07:07:49] <Zencurse> Oh by no means am I passing judgement. I'm not nearly familiar enough with the game to do so. I'm literally just worried that I won't be able to enjoy the game cuz of it
[2022-12-10 07:08:08] <%+MrZev> I don't, RimWorld was clear in it's crafting and it seems just as elaborate.
[2022-12-10 07:08:11] <+Luckyno__> The only thing that bothers me is having to specify material in situations where I don't care.
[2022-12-10 07:08:24] <+Luckyno__> like when buying meat, I dont care wombat meat or deer
[2022-12-10 07:08:27] <%+MrZev> I dono*
[2022-12-10 07:08:40] <Ruinkind> Fair enough, saying its a old game is more so from the era it comes from.
[2022-12-10 07:08:49] <Ruinkind> There isn't tooltips of wiki entries, etc.
[2022-12-10 07:08:55] <+skagator> The game is complex and it’s unreasonable to expect the ui to fix that
[2022-12-10 07:08:59] <%$eSaltcracker> yeah a lot of it is structural, now the overlay is good for new people but lacks tools for long time players to craft by hotkeys and just spam the keyboard to do everything
[2022-12-10 07:09:04] <%+MrZev> in that this is more elaborate or that rimworld did a good job being clear
[2022-12-10 07:09:14] <%Dyrk> in RW all things devolve to 1 type of wood, DF has like 100 types of wood
[2022-12-10 07:09:19] <Dadburry> yeah, pawns only care if its human meat
[2022-12-10 07:09:24] <%rty275> every single dwarf has preferences for many many different things
[2022-12-10 07:09:25] <3rdlevelwizard> They need a variety too.
[2022-12-10 07:09:27] <Zencurse> I was able to parse Rimworld's UI easily enough. So in comparison idk how this is
[2022-12-10 07:09:29] <Dadburry> while dorfs have preferences and shit
[2022-12-10 07:09:44] <3rdlevelwizard> Deeper simulation too.
[2022-12-10 07:09:56] <%rty275> the different woods and stones in df have different tensile strengths and densities and whatnot that genuinely matter when you're making stuff
[2022-12-10 07:10:06] <%+MrZev> dyrk but you make a sculpture, you choose the material. you can choose the crafter, how far away the mats are.
[2022-12-10 07:10:21] <%$eSaltcracker> way bigger and more cohesive world in dwarf fortress, rimworld always feels disjointed and random
[2022-12-10 07:10:23] <FormallyGreen> human, meat, or veg vs. literally made out of literally anything in the game
[2022-12-10 07:10:55] <Zencurse> Yeah, I've always accepted Rimworld's lack of specifitiy as a result of the dynamisim of the game. I wonder if DF can accomplish this.
[2022-12-10 07:11:00] <$unknownohyeah> the layers are sick
[2022-12-10 07:11:03] <%Dyrk> but that's like half the different options for stuff I'm seeing here
[2022-12-10 07:11:03] <Ruinkind> The layers add so much.
[2022-12-10 07:11:08] <+Azawrath> your mayor/baroness will literally charge someone with treason for hauling something to the trade depot (and its sold) they put an export ban on
[2022-12-10 07:11:17] <%+MrZev> formallygreen , except venerated meats you gotta watch out for.
[2022-12-10 07:11:27] <Ruinkind> I suppose if you had layers in a game like Rimworld, it would simply explode.  LUL
[2022-12-10 07:11:40] <%EpicPumaNess> I would get annoyed with the layers, just cause I'd forget which layer I put stuff on
[2022-12-10 07:11:44] <Zencurse> I wonder how Z-axis would be approached in an optimal situation. I think it's needed. Rimworld always bothered me because a lack of it. But idk how to handle it better.
[2022-12-10 07:11:44] <%+Destrina> I wouldn't mind if RimWorld had 3-5 total layers.
[2022-12-10 07:11:48] <3rdlevelwizard> Layers lead to a much more efficient fort.
[2022-12-10 07:11:54] <sublimal2> 20years from now they'll come out with an isometric 3d version with all the layers visible
[2022-12-10 07:11:55] <$Rakken245> Hi Mr. Hammer
[2022-12-10 07:11:58] <%$eSaltcracker> yes very helpful for segmentation
[2022-12-10 07:12:30] <%+MrZev> RimWorld you have a massive x,y.  this you have a smaller x,y but you also have z
[2022-12-10 07:12:35] <+HoneyMacs> there is
[2022-12-10 07:12:37] <+BipolarPolarBear> you can
[2022-12-10 07:12:40] <%DerekTheDeliman> lol does everyone get their own coffin? Just a constant reminder of their mortality
[2022-12-10 07:12:49] <+BipolarPolarBear> H
[2022-12-10 07:13:14] <+Azawrath> LUL
[2022-12-10 07:13:18] <3rdlevelwizard> I think it’s nice to be able to look at a layer with a single purpose?
[2022-12-10 07:13:26] <+HoneyMacs> time to program more stuff lol
[2022-12-10 07:13:27] <%Lakart> I cough cough hinted about this feature two days ago richLUL
[2022-12-10 07:13:34] <sublimal2> it's like f buttons in starcraft 2 :)
[2022-12-10 07:13:37] <%+MrZev> this also has movement in a grid fashion which simplifies the calculations in drawing framerates.
[2022-12-10 07:14:31] <%Lakart> You can also adjust how many tiles it snaps at once when you pan around in the settings
[2022-12-10 07:14:34] <+BipolarPolarBear> h is the hotkey but the physical button is under the play button. additionally the other icons take you to lowest and highest
[2022-12-10 07:15:06] <%+MrZev> you don't see the framerates with this game because the movement is staggered, which is kinda neat.
[2022-12-10 07:15:13] <Zencurse> Can yiou change the gamespeed? I just noticed there seems to be only one "play" option in the upper right

[2022-12-10 07:26:20] <FormallyGreen> shell is indeed bone
[2022-12-10 07:26:55] <FormallyGreen> at least as far as dwarf fortress is concerned
[2022-12-10 07:27:29] <+painter42> Do you just point the army to where to go then ?
[2022-12-10 07:27:32] <%ABadTanker> So can you just set up an area you prefer they fight in or it just kinda happens where it happens
[2022-12-10 07:27:54] <sublimal2> old game had Adventurer mode where you controlled an individual

[2022-12-10 07:32:39] <%+MrZev> I think for me what makes this game look bad is the font.

[2022-12-10 08:01:24] <+Frosty_Virago> Maybe it doesn't like the 2k resolution...
[2022-12-10 08:01:25] <%+Usinji> @Frosty_Virago You gotta go in to settings and change the maximum width for resolution
[2022-12-10 08:01:55] <+Frosty_Virago> Many thanks @usinji
[2022-12-10 08:01:56] <%+Usinji> It was like that for me. Just change the number to whatever resolution you're using
[2022-12-10 08:02:29] <+Frosty_Virago> I've been having so much fun already with it

[2022-12-10 08:11:01] <+Frosty_Virago> I think there's a follow button? Not sure tho
[2022-12-10 08:11:37] <+Frosty_Virago> At least old DF had one.
[2022-12-10 08:11:45] <emptyxD> maybe when you feed the bird enough it just goes away
[2022-12-10 08:11:47] <+Frosty_Virago> Hopefully not
[2022-12-10 08:12:07] <FormallyGreen> it has 5 children
[2022-12-10 08:12:11] <Ruinkind> It has kil in its name.  LUL
[2022-12-10 08:12:20] <FormallyGreen> its just trying to feed its babies
[2022-12-10 08:12:25] <%reds0l> oh man here we go
[2022-12-10 08:12:31] <emptyxD> how deep is that river please LUL
[2022-12-10 08:13:15] <%Lakart> Yo are those elephants attacking the bird too

[2022-12-10 08:13:54] <+HoneyMacs> defend the colony!
[2022-12-10 08:14:00] <%Lakart> It's unconscious lol
[2022-12-10 08:14:12] <+Frosty_Virago> And unconscious apparently
[2022-12-10 08:14:47] <+HoneyMacs> thats a fatty head
[2022-12-10 08:15:10] <%Lakart> It said that last time you looked too lol
[2022-12-10 08:15:16] <tobyleroan> can you capture it?
[2022-12-10 08:15:24] <emptyxD> they just hit it with fists LUL
[2022-12-10 08:15:41] <%Lakart> I assume it's difficult to punch a bird the size of a whale to death
[2022-12-10 08:16:18] <+scottish1900> If it bleeds we can kill it
[2022-12-10 08:16:49] <FormallyGreen> theres a tab in the top right of the overview where you can tab between things on the same tile

[2022-12-10 08:17:40] <%EpicPumaNess> that's a big fucking bird
[2022-12-10 08:17:42] <%Lakart> @Azawrath Rocs are mythical birds with wingspans that can blot out the sky
[2022-12-10 08:17:47] <anerion> no wonder it took a week to kill
[2022-12-10 08:17:48] <%EpicPumaNess> ^
[2022-12-10 08:17:50] <emptyxD> elephant?
[2022-12-10 08:17:56] <Dadburry> thats alot of coffins you can make out of it

[2022-12-10 08:18:07] <FormallyGreen> butcher that thing we eating tonight
[2022-12-10 08:18:11] <%+xFith> rocs can pick up and eat elephants like eagles eat fish
[2022-12-10 08:18:13] <+HoneyMacs> can you butcher that thing?
[2022-12-10 08:18:14] <+ForgottenReaper> Statue maybe?
[2022-12-10 08:18:16] <%reds0l> bruh that thing is weighty how did they knock it out so fast.
[2022-12-10 08:18:41] <%+xFith> knees?
[2022-12-10 08:18:46] <%Durst_In_The_Wind> Like aerobics?
[2022-12-10 08:18:51] <%+Destrina> Sense of touch
[2022-12-10 08:18:51] <%Lakart> Good spatial senses
[2022-12-10 08:18:53] <%+xFith> joints?
[2022-12-10 08:18:53] <Dadburry> moving
[2022-12-10 08:18:55] <+Azawrath> @Azawrath yeah but still that was what 5 didgits? hehe
[2022-12-10 08:19:02] <%EpicPumaNess> spatial awareness of limbs
[2022-12-10 08:19:06] <anerion> an intuitive knowledge of how your body relates to the area around you
[2022-12-10 08:19:08] <%Lakart> Meaning the elephant wont bump into shit for no reason
[2022-12-10 08:19:17] <+HoneyMacs> id wanna see that
[2022-12-10 08:19:26] <%Lakart> Because we need the whole god damn fort just to move the corpse Dick
[2022-12-10 08:19:32] <Dadburry> not everyday you get to see a dead bird the size of an aircraft carrier
[2022-12-10 08:19:47] <+Azawrath> thanks elf bros
[2022-12-10 08:19:58] <Dadburry> the entire corpse at once? hell nah
[2022-12-10 08:20:00] <widsz> cut it into pieces
[2022-12-10 08:20:01] <Deleroth> it died and became a monument
[2022-12-10 08:20:11] <+ForgottenReaper> Stuff it in a wheelbarrow
[2022-12-10 08:20:14] <emptyxD> xDxD
[2022-12-10 08:20:15] <grippus_> Lol it’s skeleton will just be there now, forever
[2022-12-10 08:20:18] <%Lakart> If you can't move it...that's a lot of miasma richLUL
[2022-12-10 08:20:18] <+ForgottenReaper> Should be fine Kappa
[2022-12-10 08:20:18] <+HoneyMacs> hell yeah
[2022-12-10 08:20:30] <FormallyGreen> who ended up getting the kill?
[2022-12-10 08:20:33] <anerion> is the child a skilled fighter now?
[2022-12-10 08:20:34] <%reds0l> man everyone wanted a piece
[2022-12-10 08:20:49] <+Frosty_Virago> There should be a tab for multiple items/entities when they're on top of each other.
[2022-12-10 08:21:11] <%rty275> those weights are kg
[2022-12-10 08:21:14] <%rty275> directly
[2022-12-10 08:21:20] <Dadburry> its 1 to 1 in kilos
[2022-12-10 08:21:25] <emptyxD> "An item's weight is determined by multiplying its volume by the density of its material divided by 1000. For example, iron (7.85) bars (200) weigh 1570Γ"
[2022-12-10 08:21:43] <AlexOfDoom> 58 tons thats a flying tank
[2022-12-10 08:21:43] <emptyxD> idk if that helps
[2022-12-10 08:21:50] <%Grimfan> The thing eats its wheaties
[2022-12-10 08:21:51] <%Lakart> Apparently elephants weigh around 1500
[2022-12-10 08:21:56] <Dadburry> apparently that Г is also known as Urists
[2022-12-10 08:22:02] <%rty275> wingspan a mile long
[2022-12-10 08:22:09] <Deleroth> @Grimfan that thing eats whales
[2022-12-10 08:22:14] <IrateInitiate> the roc is immune to the square-cube law
[2022-12-10 08:22:14] <%Lakart> It's supposed to be a predatory bird that eats whales and elephants Dick lol
[2022-12-10 08:22:16] <%Lakart> It's huge
[2022-12-10 08:22:23] <@%BranLan> The amount of head fat punches makes sense now
[2022-12-10 08:22:33] <+Outrider> Rocs are like legendary birds so it makes sense
[2022-12-10 08:22:40] <%EpicPumaNess> Imagine a fully loaded down 18 wheeler, then add about 20k lbs
[2022-12-10 08:22:40] <+HoneyMacs> this game is so good
[2022-12-10 08:22:46] <+ForgottenReaper> Birds have hollow bones too so it would probably be even bigger than an airplane
[2022-12-10 08:22:46] <!%Calastigro> roast one whole drumstick
[2022-12-10 08:22:54] <anerion> get a wheelbarrow
[2022-12-10 08:22:54] <%+Destrina> In art, Rocs are drawn holding an elephant in one talon and the elephant is the size of a rabbit in comparison.
[2022-12-10 08:22:55] <TwinkleB> can you butcher the corpse?
[2022-12-10 08:22:57] <FormallyGreen> build a butchery on top of it?
[2022-12-10 08:23:01] <+Azawrath> can you build a butcher table under it? LUL
[2022-12-10 08:23:04] <%rty275> did you let your people outside to grab it?
[2022-12-10 08:23:25] <%rty275> LMAO
[2022-12-10 08:23:27] <anerion> or build a butcher where the roc corpse is already on the input tile?
[2022-12-10 08:23:33] <%+Usinji> lool
[2022-12-10 08:23:44] <ligerbomb> myassma
[2022-12-10 08:23:46] <%Lakart> It's gonna make more miasma than every thing killed so far combined richLUL
[2022-12-10 08:24:00] <+k_nord> how do you lift 58tons??? o.O
[2022-12-10 08:24:05] <Deleroth> "I don't think my 150 people can't lift 58 tons"
[2022-12-10 08:24:29] <%100viewbots> arms
[2022-12-10 08:24:32] <anerion> I'm ready
[2022-12-10 08:24:35] <%+Usinji> Get a horde of elephants to drag it
[2022-12-10 08:24:37] <FormallyGreen> Im ready
[2022-12-10 08:24:39] <Deleroth> each person would need to be able to carry 400 pounds
[2022-12-10 08:24:48] <Deleroth> errr 400kg
[2022-12-10 08:24:50] <%Lakart> Apparently if you know what you're doing, you can domesticate a Roc.
[2022-12-10 08:24:52] <%Lakart> Madness.
[2022-12-10 08:25:02] <+Frosty_Virago> I'm curious how it only takes up one tile
[2022-12-10 08:25:21] <Dadburry> its a very dense bord
[2022-12-10 08:25:26] <+scottish1900> So wait what do you do with it, just let it rot? LUL
[2022-12-10 08:25:29] <Deleroth> it's a long bird
[2022-12-10 08:25:37] <%Lakart> @Frosty_Virago How does a donkey carry a yak in a cage on its back? The world may never know
[2022-12-10 08:25:40] <daguava> they know how to exceed every sponsor with this one weird trick that a local doctor doesn't want you to know
[2022-12-10 08:25:53] <+Frosty_Virago> That's fair yeah...
[2022-12-10 08:25:54] <%100viewbots> this lowest level really gives prison vibes

[2022-12-10 08:27:41] <+Frosty_Virago> Not a single leaf out of place
[2022-12-10 08:28:08] <grippus_> Waiting for the DF aerospace engineering update

[2022-12-10 08:54:56] <AlexOfDoom> Did some quick maths for funsies. Using the bald eagle as an example, the Roc that you killed would have a wingspan of roughly 114 miles. LUL
[2022-12-10 08:55:01] <ActsofInfamy> Ye it do be
[2022-12-10 08:55:04] <emptyxD> Eiri_Amach i feel already burend out from leveling in the stupid story :)
[2022-12-10 08:55:32] <%+jsf_frostbyte> I think it was a megabeast
[2022-12-10 08:55:33] <!%Calastigro> @AlexOfDoom did you account for weight varying as a cube and wingspan being linear
[2022-12-10 08:56:17] <TwinkleB> Do you get more money when I click the ads in the app? cause I keep trying to click this one from amazon but it doesnt do anything.
[2022-12-10 08:56:24] <ActsofInfamy> There's gotta be some scientific principle that describes the required length of wingspan per unit of weight needed to actually acquire lift to fly.
[2022-12-10 08:56:38] <AlexOfDoom> it was just for funsies, but regardless the fucker could eclipse the sun for your little fortress
[2022-12-10 08:56:43] <%Tomijiro> you also haven't accounted for the muscle mass required too
[2022-12-10 08:56:49] <!%Calastigro> when you make something twice as big in every dimension, it gets 8 times heavier
[2022-12-10 08:56:50] <TwinkleB> fuck them ads then.
[2022-12-10 08:56:58] <emptyxD> and all the head fat
[2022-12-10 08:57:01] <ActsofInfamy> The Roc had a fat head
[2022-12-10 08:57:25] <%EpicPumaNess> Roc's just have anti gravity powers, so even if they weigh alot, they're still able to fly, problem solved
[2022-12-10 08:57:54] <emptyxD> pff...next thing he says is santa isnt real
[2022-12-10 08:57:56] <%$PaperKnight> Well Neither should Bees
[2022-12-10 08:57:57] <%EpicPumaNess> dragons could fly via magic, but not by exploiting physics
[2022-12-10 08:58:00] <%$PaperKnight> yet those mfs do
[2022-12-10 08:58:05] <ActsofInfamy> Scientists are often nerds so I bet they've done the math
[2022-12-10 08:58:36] <dedgreenboi> I am that nerd
[2022-12-10 08:58:53] <%Lakart> Imagine how much more confusing this would be if it was a Kun-Peng and not a Roc
[2022-12-10 08:58:54] <%RageRequiem> as I recall DnD dragons canonically can only fly because magic
[2022-12-10 08:59:55] <thinklike> it was a pull out in Potters weekly
[2022-12-10 09:00:00] <!%Calastigro> i read juggs for the articles
[2022-12-10 09:00:01] <$Klimpwn> Does that type of jugs have to be spelt in all caps with 3 g's? Like JUGGGS?
[2022-12-10 09:00:23] <AlexOfDoom> "wasnt that a magazine?" sounded real convincing there Kappa
[2022-12-10 09:00:24] <%$Eiri_Amach> I've always imagined Dragons (lmao) did more of a high jump and glide type of thing. Or they might inflate gas sacs with hot air if they're a fire breathing variety
[2022-12-10 09:00:26] <Running_Pie> The physics required to defy gravity is the same for everyone and everything. The method used to do so varies. Like bees do not just flap their they fully rotate their wings each flap gaining lift on both the up and down stroke.
[2022-12-10 09:00:31] <%$Eiri_Amach> as my group
[2022-12-10 09:00:34] <%$Eiri_Amach> oops*
[2022-12-10 09:00:52] <%$Eiri_Amach> As my group's DM I have to rule lots of goofy shit like this all the time lmao
[2022-12-10 09:02:05] <%$Eiri_Amach> what if my fiancee is one of my players? :o
[2022-12-10 09:02:16] <%+Usinji> @Running_Pie So whats the method for a fantasy creature that can also breathe fire lol? I just think dragons fly because the story teller said so

[2022-12-10 09:03:10] <+Frosty_Virago> which one?
[2022-12-10 09:03:15] <Running_Pie> @Running_Pie Dragons use the rule of cool to fly. we ask why because its cool
[2022-12-10 09:03:22] <Blind_fires> hey man, sometimes sexual favors get you cool loot.
[2022-12-10 09:03:22] <%$Eiri_Amach> Ironically, I murdered her character first in the first TPK I ever DM'ed.  She was pissed for days.
[2022-12-10 09:03:34] <%$kuakae> dont want to get those d20s stuck in weird places
[2022-12-10 09:03:48] <thinklike> you need some rum

[2022-12-10 09:04:18] <+BlackShi> What are those two big button on the top left do?
[2022-12-10 09:04:29] <%$Eiri_Amach> And, living together, I've kinda just turned her into co-DM. I hide the main story spoilers from her, but I do bounce a lot of ideas off of her, and she vets my homebrew items and voice changer settings and things for playtest
[2022-12-10 09:04:53] <Blind_fires> non-aggression, i'd think?

[2022-12-10 09:12:57] <!%Calastigro> what's his name? Tarn Adams, the main guy? i wonder what his house is like
[2022-12-10 09:13:03] <!%Calastigro> if it's made of dolemite
[2022-12-10 09:13:30] <phillymilksteak> There are some bangers in the soundtrack. I just wished the music was a little more consistent
[2022-12-10 09:13:39] <%ABadTanker> Have you ever seen paper before?
[2022-12-10 09:14:24] <phillymilksteak> Probably one of your artifacts
[2022-12-10 09:14:44] <CthuutLoops> @Calastigro on some of his interviews he does them from home. one time he did talk about how his cat has its own laptop to let him use his own uninterrupted.
[2022-12-10 09:14:56] <NGraak> they're robbing you of your artifact
[2022-12-10 09:15:02] <Anongamer> will most likely end when your dwarf gives it to them

[2022-12-10 10:13:30] <yuwuumi> so many cats
[2022-12-10 10:13:32] <SimonSez> Are those cats?
[2022-12-10 10:14:02] <%EpicPumaNess> You gotta Dwarf to dwarf the other dwarfs trying to dwarf on your turf

[2022-12-10 10:15:03] <eronese> !please
[2022-12-10 10:15:03] <@^Moobot> @eronese Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-10 10:15:25] <NotLevos> there was also that caves of qud game right?
[2022-12-10 10:16:43] <+Frosty_Virago> Caves of Qud is fun
[2022-12-10 10:16:53] <+Frosty_Virago> A much different game though
[2022-12-10 10:17:36] <+Frosty_Virago> I can't imagine trying to go up and down those stairs. Must be crowded AF
[2022-12-10 10:17:55] <NotLevos> caves of qud has also weird dune style lore
[2022-12-10 10:18:05] <NotLevos> psychedelic sci-fi
[2022-12-10 10:18:10] <+Frosty_Virago> Procedurally generated too
[2022-12-10 10:18:12] <!%Calastigro> @NotLevos do they have the sex nuns tho
[2022-12-10 10:18:17] <+Frosty_Virago> Much like DF
[2022-12-10 10:18:31] <%+Usinji> Is my dwarf still floating around or did I meet a tragic end?  richLurking
[2022-12-10 10:18:49] <NotLevos> @Calastigro no idea, but it has psychic camel-people
[2022-12-10 10:19:04] <+Frosty_Virago> And all of the plants are sentient
[2022-12-10 10:19:15] <%+Usinji> Your dwarf list is gurthy lol
[2022-12-10 10:19:25] <+Frosty_Virago> 153 lol
[2022-12-10 10:19:32] <+ThatSl1me> There should be a search box for the dwarves so you can find them by name
[2022-12-10 10:19:44] <+Frosty_Virago> There might be
[2022-12-10 10:19:50] <+Frosty_Virago> TBH
[2022-12-10 10:21:22] <+Frosty_Virago> Honestly tho eating with a window view of a waterfall would be dope
[2022-12-10 10:21:22] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-10 10:21:40] <+Frosty_Virago> Although if it was on the backend it'd just be covered in water LUL
[2022-12-10 10:21:54] <NGraak> or relocate the waterfall to the tavern!
[2022-12-10 10:22:33] <+Frosty_Virago> More like if you put up glass so you could see the waterfall but the room was behind it, you wouldn't really see it
[2022-12-10 10:22:35] <BonelessSugar> whats the objective of DF
[2022-12-10 10:22:45] <+Frosty_Virago> Just a window covered in water
[2022-12-10 10:22:58] <+Frosty_Virago> Do whatever pleases you @bonelesssugar
[2022-12-10 10:23:08] <Mizashiz> looks complicated
[2022-12-10 10:23:13] <NGraak> if you build your own you can do all the glasswork you want LUL
[2022-12-10 10:23:13] <+scottish1900> I def see how this inspired rimworld
[2022-12-10 10:23:13] <+Frosty_Virago> It is
[2022-12-10 10:23:20] <%+Destrina> I sure couldn't tell you how, but I know it's possible.
[2022-12-10 10:23:24] <%Ravenkorpse> when is there going to be an infestation richHm
[2022-12-10 10:23:42] <RTSMonochrome> or use waterfalls against enemys
[2022-12-10 10:23:50] <thefaint94> sounds like people go to college for waterfall engineering tbh
[2022-12-10 10:24:06] <%$Weeeluu> @scottish1900 you mean rimworld was inspired by this?
[2022-12-10 10:24:14] <Mizashiz> nope
[2022-12-10 10:24:22] <+Frosty_Virago> That'd be a lot of remodeling...
[2022-12-10 10:24:40] <%+Destrina> Yes, Rimworld was very much inspired by this.
[2022-12-10 10:24:40] <+Frosty_Virago> Depends where you want it IG
[2022-12-10 10:25:02] <+scottish1900> Yeah that's what I said, this inspired rimworld
[2022-12-10 10:25:06] <%EpicPumaNess> it's not a question of if... experiments must occur
[2022-12-10 10:25:07] <$geek2games> as long as you mine out the waterfall on a layer the water is falling past, and not one with water on it, it won't flood, the only risk is a dorf may fall down the waterfall and drown while digging it out.
[2022-12-10 10:25:12] <+Frosty_Virago> That's true yeah
[2022-12-10 10:25:14] <yuwuumi> @Weeeluu this game is 20 years old
[2022-12-10 10:25:18] <%$Weeeluu> @scottish1900 :)
[2022-12-10 10:25:18] <%EpicPumaNess> play god, create nature
[2022-12-10 10:25:27] <%$Weeeluu> @yuwuumi im aware
[2022-12-10 10:25:39] <+Frosty_Virago> DF do be old
[2022-12-10 10:25:51] <Ruinkind> Damn time traveling devs.
[2022-12-10 10:25:53] <RTSMonochrome> maybe dig a ladder to ground and only after the way is done, connect it with the water or so
[2022-12-10 10:26:00] <Dadburry> alot of things take inspiration from the OG DF
[2022-12-10 10:26:05] <RTSMonochrome> but water has to go somewhere
[2022-12-10 10:26:10] <Dadburry> that game is very important
[2022-12-10 10:26:23] <+Frosty_Virago> I mean... it did basically coin the colony Sim genre
[2022-12-10 10:26:31] <NGraak> dwarven plumbing school
[2022-12-10 10:26:32] <+scottish1900> Though I do like the visuals of this more, I dunno if I am allowed to say that LUL
[2022-12-10 10:26:40] <+Frosty_Virago> idk why I capitalized sim there
[2022-12-10 10:27:10] <RTSMonochrome> imagine bringing water to lava and use the steam as energy
[2022-12-10 10:27:17] <+Frosty_Virago> wouldn't it just be the normal mining tool?
[2022-12-10 10:27:18] <RTSMonochrome> would blew my mind if thats possible
[2022-12-10 10:27:21] <NGraak> you could always do a practice run to the right side area
[2022-12-10 10:27:35] <Ruinkind> There is one from like the 60's.  @Frosty_Virago
[2022-12-10 10:27:46] <+Frosty_Virago> but you'd move up/down elevation like with stairs?
[2022-12-10 10:27:57] <+Frosty_Virago> DF do be old @ruinkind
[2022-12-10 10:28:01] <+moldy_fuzz> water accidents are a rite of passage
[2022-12-10 10:28:09] <Ruinkind> DF is old, but not from the 60's.  @Frosty_Virago
[2022-12-10 10:28:19] <NGraak> channel
[2022-12-10 10:28:23] <%EpicPumaNess> with a shovel Kappa
[2022-12-10 10:28:27] <+moldy_fuzz> channel
[2022-12-10 10:28:31] <$geek2games> channel looks like this: \/
[2022-12-10 10:28:35] <NGraak> then you dig out the ramp afterward
[2022-12-10 10:28:35] <+Frosty_Virago> wait so what's from the 60s
[2022-12-10 10:28:41] <Oath_Othelio> channel removes the floor, and you can go to the lower level and remove that
[2022-12-10 10:28:52] <Ruinkind> I'll google it, sec.  @Frosty_Virago
[2022-12-10 10:28:57] <%$Weeeluu> @RTSMonochrome you can do that in oxygen not included
[2022-12-10 10:28:57] <Ruinkind> I forget the name.
[2022-12-10 10:29:19] <+ThatSl1me> Theres a few different ways to do it
[2022-12-10 10:29:28] <malfiory> do you like this better or rim world ?
[2022-12-10 10:29:35] <+HoneyMacs> this has made me wanna play oni honestly
[2022-12-10 10:29:45] <Ruinkind> The Sumerian Game from 1964, a couple others from the 80's.  DF is definitely a OG, but not the first.  @Frosty_Virago
[2022-12-10 10:30:01] <NGraak> there was no ground under that channel so it was a straight hole
[2022-12-10 10:30:20] <+Frosty_Virago> DF isn't the first colony game, it's just the one that coined the term we use today
[2022-12-10 10:30:51] <+moldy_fuzz> @honeymacs time passes so fast playing this game, 1 hour feels like 10 minutes
[2022-12-10 10:30:54] <Oath_Othelio> moving water is good FUN!
[2022-12-10 10:31:15] <+Frosty_Virago> less dangerous than moving lava IG
[2022-12-10 10:31:21] <Ruinkind> I get you like the game, but history is history.  LUL  @Frosty_Virago
[2022-12-10 10:31:38] <+Frosty_Virago> depends on how fast it's going
[2022-12-10 10:31:38] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-10 10:31:46] <$geek2games> Water is more dangerous than lava in DF, water has pressure and moves super fast, you can run from lava.
[2022-12-10 10:32:36] <+Tarotking> you could always make a test room
[2022-12-10 10:33:22] <+Frosty_Virago> Always the best time
[2022-12-10 10:33:26] <+Tarotking> tired us the time when we try stupid things
[2022-12-10 10:33:32] <+Tarotking> thats the fun of being tired
[2022-12-10 10:33:35] <+moldy_fuzz> "quick"
[2022-12-10 10:35:50] <NGraak> you have to dig it out on the same level i think
[2022-12-10 10:35:55] <$geek2games> it's because it's a dug out staircase and not a constructed one.
[2022-12-10 10:36:06] <Oath_Othelio> have you been getting bombarded by bard requests too lol
[2022-12-10 10:36:10] <+ThatSl1me> There is a way to remove the stair
[2022-12-10 10:36:12] <Oath_Othelio> I've had over 100 bards petition to join my fort
[2022-12-10 10:36:23] <$geek2games> just cover it with constructed flooring, or a hatch.
[2022-12-10 10:36:40] <+moldy_fuzz> LUL
[2022-12-10 10:37:09] <NGraak> double waterfalls cause double rainbows right?
[2022-12-10 10:38:14] <dedgreenboi> rooClown I let a clown into my Keep once, None lSurvived
[2022-12-10 10:40:08] <FacelessGuy> lol
[2022-12-10 10:40:26] <Oath_Othelio> water is so hard to deal with when you can't just slap another wall into it
[2022-12-10 10:40:31] <+k_nord> are they removed from the pen?
[2022-12-10 10:40:46] <+ThatSl1me> Not assigned to the pen zone?
[2022-12-10 10:40:59] <%dream_unskilled> maybe pen too small?
[2022-12-10 10:42:17] <RTSMonochrome> famous last words

[2022-12-10 10:42:23] <RTSMonochrome> id fuck the idea for now
[2022-12-10 10:42:28] <NGraak> check out water floodgates
[2022-12-10 10:42:28] <RTSMonochrome> let it go
[2022-12-10 10:43:25] <NGraak> i didn't want to ruin your learning experience
[2022-12-10 10:43:46] <$hexdecs> they might be fine in shallow water
[2022-12-10 10:43:52] <+moldy_fuzz> ya I'm kee
[2022-12-10 10:43:55] <+scottish1900> So wait why are you making a waterfall? LUL
[2022-12-10 10:44:17] <+moldy_fuzz> keeping my mouth shut*
[2022-12-10 10:44:23] <RTSMonochrome> man u already have a waterfall
[2022-12-10 10:44:31] <Oath_Othelio> with the steam workshop, there's still hope for the Dwarf D
[2022-12-10 10:44:32] <%$kuakae> richard, dont go chasing waterfalls
[2022-12-10 10:44:52] <+scottish1900> It's well known that waterfalls are only a little bit worse than blowies to be fair
[2022-12-10 10:44:53] <RTSMonochrome> we have waterfalls at home .. waterfalls at home
[2022-12-10 10:45:36] <%$kuakae> i mean i absolutely want to see it happen but i also wanted to get in that quote
[2022-12-10 10:45:58] <Templex2> I remember putting a misting waterfall wall into one of my great halls, a long time ago.
[2022-12-10 10:46:27] <+scottish1900> I mean what's the worst that happens honestly
[2022-12-10 10:46:56] <+scottish1900> Yeah but think about it, if youdon't kill your colony and it works you get a sick in cave waterfall
[2022-12-10 10:47:06] <Ruinkind> At least they will all die by their glorious mist source.
[2022-12-10 10:47:06] <ZanielGa> Sounds like a small price for failure to me.
[2022-12-10 10:47:06] <Templex2> On the bright side, you can then plant plump helmets everywhere flooded
[2022-12-10 10:47:26] <%$kuakae> you just need to rephrase that. you turn your colony into the legendary atlantis
[2022-12-10 10:47:26] <RTSMonochrome> i like dieing to demons, the fuck u have against demons
[2022-12-10 10:47:30] <+scottish1900> Honestly if I died because my landlord said he was trying to make a waterfall, I would take that
[2022-12-10 10:47:47] <$Nathangnouv> have you encountered any giant glame spreading demons since
[2022-12-10 10:47:48] <+scottish1900> Because even though it failed, it was still a pretty sick idea
[2022-12-10 10:48:39] <%$kuakae> im curious to see how well the water will flow at a 90 degree angle to the main stream
[2022-12-10 10:49:19] <+scottish1900> I bet it'd look kool kuakae
[2022-12-10 10:49:44] <emptyxD> does water rise and fall in level when you build a dam or smth?
[2022-12-10 10:50:13] <!%Calastigro> "i would assume maybe" LUL
[2022-12-10 10:50:18] <emptyxD> xD
[2022-12-10 10:51:04] <%+Usinji> The lever situation took me an obscene amount of time to figure out lol.
[2022-12-10 10:51:09] <emptyxD> "cavemen who doesnt know how levers work, floods entire fortress, 153 dead"
[2022-12-10 10:51:33] <%+scottish1900> Listen man dwarfs flooding their mountain fortress trying to make a waterfall might be the most dwarf way to die
[2022-12-10 10:51:53] <%+scottish1900> Other fortresses would see that and go "Damn dude shame they died but think about how sick that would have been if it worked"

[2022-12-10 10:54:23] <%+scottish1900> I think dwarf basketball would be more like dwarf rugby
[2022-12-10 10:54:54] <%+scottish1900> Honestly any dwarf sport would be like hockey, where violence is a major part of the game
[2022-12-10 10:54:57] <Mizashiz> this is dwarf sportress
[2022-12-10 10:54:59] <%+scottish1900> Also a LOT of beer

[2022-12-10 10:55:11] <emptyxD> hey...he is preparing dwarf water polo ok
[2022-12-10 10:55:52] <%+scottish1900> In fact, I dare say any sports for dwarfs would have mandatory beer given to people that watch it

[2022-12-10 11:08:24] <%Convectt> what is the benefit of having a waterfall? Except, you know, that it is a cool thing to have
[2022-12-10 11:08:25] <Tsarok> Like polo?

[2022-12-10 11:12:54] <NGraak> is there a lever tutorial?
[2022-12-10 11:14:35] <%+Usinji> This linking lever thing is frustrating. I could save you some time if you wanted?
[2022-12-10 11:14:37] <slightlycaffeinated> Did he figure out how lever works? You can place it anywhere and connect to floodgate/door/retractable bridge, etc
[2022-12-10 11:14:43] <emptyxD> well...learning by trying :)

[2022-12-10 11:21:23] <Eveanore> the game is so much easier to look at as a viewer but the one thing i'm struggling at is figuring out where you're moving the elevation without glaring at the minimap on the top right

[2022-12-10 11:47:08] <NGraak> you might need to sacrifice those rooms
[2022-12-10 11:47:32] <%$kuakae> just have a generous path around it. actually kind of seems cool to have a waterfall as the heart of your base
[2022-12-10 11:48:08] <%EpicPumaNess> soooo many coffins
[2022-12-10 11:48:14] <%Lakart> @kuakae kind of classic DF tbh
[2022-12-10 11:48:28] <%Lakart> Because waterfalls are pretty and good for murderins
[2022-12-10 11:48:32] <NGraak> oh just add a door between the left right rooms
[2022-12-10 11:48:57] <emptyxD> oh are there 15054534 tonns of roc bones now? xD
[2022-12-10 11:49:33] <%Lakart> They're short and heavy, sounds like a bad combination for falls.
[2022-12-10 11:49:38] <%Lakart> wide and heavy*
[2022-12-10 11:49:47] <%+Usinji> Once you finish the walls if someone falls they'll be trapped right? Just thinning the herd
[2022-12-10 11:50:24] <%Lakart> Do you have any non regular dwarves yet?
[2022-12-10 11:50:56] <%Lakart> Like when I said the other day my first fort got fucked by a necromancer dwarf joining the fort in the first migration lmao
[2022-12-10 11:51:10] <%+Usinji> If some of those cats fell it wouldn't be a bad thing lol
[2022-12-10 11:51:19] <Tsarok> non regular meaning they can't poop?

[2022-12-10 12:26:58] <+MoleUK> @WeatheredMachine Had the opposite experience, I click with this a lot easier for some reason. Think it's because of less micro over the colonists being necessary.
[2022-12-10 12:27:01] <r3nko_> Bahroo has quit the game after going through the tutorials lol
[2022-12-10 12:27:21] <+WeatheredMachine> @WeatheredMachine I think I struggled getting to that point!
[2022-12-10 12:27:30] <%+ImmaWizard_> like the grapihics and interface just doesnt look good to me
[2022-12-10 12:27:34] <%AnxietyPrime> @GoRibGo there's definitely overlap but it's like a Venn diagram; being in the Rimworld circle doesn't necessarily mean you'll be in the dorf circle
[2022-12-10 12:27:39] <NGraak> next up magma fall through the base
[2022-12-10 12:27:46] <Iqunlimited> well the interface for sure is a quirky thing
[2022-12-10 12:27:47] <%+ImmaWizard_> but its all perfectly functional
[2022-12-10 12:27:54] <%GoRibGo> fair, well booting it up now guess I'll find out
[2022-12-10 12:27:54] <%+Usinji> For me its because like everything matters. In rimworld only certain things matter. The rest can be tedium
[2022-12-10 12:28:08] <+MoleUK> It could definitely use some more quality of life features. But loving it all so far.
[2022-12-10 12:28:10] <+Ro0b1x> i just found it hard adjusting to the layers
[2022-12-10 12:28:16] <boydrewboy> when can these dwarves craft a gun?
[2022-12-10 12:28:20] <boydrewboy> LUL
[2022-12-10 12:28:23] <+WeatheredMachine> I did too, @Ro0b1x
[2022-12-10 12:28:27] <kaigerian> Needs more elf killing
[2022-12-10 12:28:50] <ZanielGa> Cool gemstone, would be a shame if someone accidentally put it in their pocket without asking.
[2022-12-10 12:29:14] <thefaint94> maybe if the priests at my church were skilled comedians, i would have been religious
[2022-12-10 12:29:15] <boydrewboy> 🕷️
[2022-12-10 12:29:29] <+MoleUK> He's got a thing for that spider bussy
[2022-12-10 12:29:42] <+Shaggyscoots> tell me you've never played the ascii variation of DF without telling me. Kappa
[2022-12-10 12:30:04] <%AnxietyPrime> yooo you've got a goblin poet?
[2022-12-10 12:31:01] <$Nathangnouv> have you done justice stuff yet?
[2022-12-10 12:31:14] <$Nathangnouv> I think the investigation and plots are cool
[2022-12-10 12:31:46] <boydrewboy> @Nathangnouv you tellin me you can get like a Bat-Dwarf? PogBones
[2022-12-10 12:31:52] <+Shaggyscoots> they need to add an option to send those guys away.  i had to kill like 30 of em because of pop cap
[2022-12-10 12:32:09] <+WeatheredMachine> Where does the water go *after* it goes down the waterfall
[2022-12-10 12:32:54] <+WeatheredMachine> Fascinating
[2022-12-10 12:32:56] <%AnxietyPrime> at the risk of sounding like a massive nerd I think it's always been the fact you can do like civil engineering projects that interests me in DF
[2022-12-10 12:33:35] <+Shaggyscoots> wait, what?   seriously?
[2022-12-10 12:33:51] <+Shaggyscoots> I'm a monster
[2022-12-10 12:34:23] <boydrewboy> how are this many cats in one building yet it's not overflowing with cat piss and shit?
[2022-12-10 12:34:45] <balkanredneck> this could send my adhd overheating
[2022-12-10 12:34:55] <+Shaggyscoots> guess I'll change my squad name to poetical injustice
[2022-12-10 12:35:02] <%+Usinji> @boydrewboy Just wait for the cat piss update lol
[2022-12-10 12:35:12] <boydrewboy> @Usinji monkaS
[2022-12-10 12:36:05] <$lwildchildl> wheres it exit?
[2022-12-10 12:36:05] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-10 12:36:09] <boydrewboy> 69,000 cats per grate sounds OSHA-friendly
[2022-12-10 12:36:18] <Eveanore> what do the numbers mean on the water?
[2022-12-10 12:36:23] <boydrewboy> height
[2022-12-10 12:36:33] <Eveanore> ahhh
[2022-12-10 12:36:36] <$lwildchildl> missed that part thanks lol
[2022-12-10 12:36:44] <%AnxietyPrime> yeah depth I think
[2022-12-10 12:36:57] <boydrewboy> it's ankle-deep monkaS
[2022-12-10 12:37:26] <%+Usinji> I just wonder if the bottom blocks up will in back up into your base lol
[2022-12-10 12:37:32] <boydrewboy> Don't dig too deep!
[2022-12-10 12:37:41] <%DuDeACiD> 2020Glitchy GlitchCat
[2022-12-10 12:37:45] <Iqunlimited> over -100 ZZ-levels yea
