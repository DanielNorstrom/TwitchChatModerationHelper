I have aiming but im getting rekt so hard its so frustrating. Im watching ''Loadout'' videos (So i found you play this game much from youtube)  and i have nothing from the videos. No attachment and they can ''tune'' the attachment and i cant. So no loadout video ist working for me xD I like the M4 :3
[2022-12-25 10:57:15] <+joao_rubens> And im amazed than he knows all the dinosaurs name, even if they are not on Jurassic World. Sometimes he came with some funny names and when I look it they used to be real dinosaurs!

[2022-12-25 11:46:32] <+DrBalkenTV> bundesland = state

[2022-12-25 11:46:48] <noxit_empwrd> Germany is pretty okay honestly. we complain a lot but we're still lucky to have all those benefits in Germany
[2022-12-25 11:46:53] <hookah_marcitv> @p4wnyhof wir haben für ein Kind 370 € gezahlt

[2022-12-25 11:48:17] <+TuitchPlease> to be a real authentic german you have to learn the phrase "will nich wissen wie viel sprit der wagen schluckt"
[2022-12-25 11:48:26] <noxit_empwrd> I work in healthcare in the same Bundesland you live in (RLP) and sometimes it sucks, but on the other hand everyone is cared for, so I guess that's better than most other places in the world
[2022-12-25 11:48:33] <%KenjiOrigin> @TuitchPlease "musst du wissen" also very important
[2022-12-25 11:48:40] <+DrBalkenTV> *the taxaccountant meanwhile in chat* :(  "hello darkness my old friend" .. .xDDDD
