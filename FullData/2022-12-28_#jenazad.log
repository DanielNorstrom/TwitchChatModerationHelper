[2022-12-28 07:31:43] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-28 08:03:29] <ludolphj> I legit farmed a protection set for my a.tywin just to counter Lua. if you have units with immunity she can't reset. she only straps the barriers.
[2022-12-28 08:03:42] <ludolphj> strips.
[2022-12-28 08:03:47] <complx7> If her s3 was reduce duration instead of strip she’d still be good but not as oppressive
[2022-12-28 08:03:47] <IUnbreakableGamingI> !atywin
[2022-12-28 08:03:47] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2022-12-28 08:23:47] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-28 09:30:57] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-28 11:40:24] <Shirousa> to be fair, if one piece anime actually had better pacing than half a chapter every 3 episodes it'd be significantly better

[2022-12-28 11:41:01] <Bookwormz> Naruto would have been okay if not for the amount of filler and One Piece is the worst at pacing but its gotten a little better than 400 episodes ago but not saying much

[2022-12-28 12:12:00] <%barald> BASED
[2022-12-28 12:12:00] <nowimpanickin> well yeah
[2022-12-28 12:12:04] <%yorozuya06> bloodborne is too good
[2022-12-28 12:12:06] <%ZessZZ> bloodborne and elden ring are top tier
[2022-12-28 12:12:06] <alsostu> bloodborne shits on most souls games
[2022-12-28 12:12:08] <Shirousa> i think all of it's successors shit on demon souls
[2022-12-28 12:12:09] <!%$GeorgeOfTheJgI> i have no context for how far this is. i think jena is on perfect pace
[2022-12-28 12:12:11] <nowimpanickin> based
[2022-12-28 12:12:12] <shadowfury33> Bloodborne is my all time fav game
[2022-12-28 12:12:12] <Laytens> no
[2022-12-28 12:12:13] <%Foxcloak> imo the absence of music is what makes the athmosphere awesome
[2022-12-28 12:12:15] <Laytens> ds2 is way worse
[2022-12-28 12:12:24] <nowimpanickin> @Laytens I unironically like ds2
[2022-12-28 12:12:30] <Shirousa> people hate DS2 but i don't think it was that bad
[2022-12-28 12:12:31] <nowimpanickin> at least scholar
[2022-12-28 12:12:31] <%yorozuya06> here we go again about ds2
[2022-12-28 12:12:33] <%zonkie_wonkie> ds2 is so bad, its sometimes good
[2022-12-28 12:12:41] <Laytens> ds12 is a very good game, just not as good as other souls games IMO
[2022-12-28 12:12:44] <jay4137> i liked ds2
[2022-12-28 12:12:46] <%Im_salty_420> ds2 stream when?

[2022-12-28 12:12:58] <Yetiapocalypse> yeah consensus is that this is the most dated of all soulsborne games
[2022-12-28 12:13:00] <smokingthatgreenstuff> thats fair. if you havent played ds2
[2022-12-28 12:13:01] <%Suwayya> No man. Sekiro is the worst souls game.

[2022-12-28 12:13:50] <aneixsus_sy> Epic 24/7 is better than VLR

[2022-12-28 12:21:45] <%+eastnychamp> souls like mecha
[2022-12-28 12:21:53] <+ApePecs> You would set up your loadout wrong, go into a mission, and be unable to move or attack
[2022-12-28 12:22:01] <%aevism> AC is crazy cuz of the customization
[2022-12-28 12:22:04] <%+eastnychamp> dont think so
[2022-12-28 12:22:04] <shinkirito69> its customization is pretty in depth
[2022-12-28 12:22:16] <Shirousa> not liek a souls game
[2022-12-28 12:22:18] <Shirousa> so that's boring
[2022-12-28 12:22:20] <Shirousa> ;(
[2022-12-28 12:22:27] <bobveela> yeah the customization was great, diff legds/arms/core/head, weapons for back and each arm
[2022-12-28 12:22:37] <stevenj__> I hope it plays like "for answer"
[2022-12-28 12:22:42] <%aevism> its actually very challenging, just that lots of people use glitch in the environment to win the battles
[2022-12-28 12:22:49] <%+eastnychamp> been a while since a good mecha came out tho
[2022-12-28 12:22:57] <shinkirito69> for answer is the most anime of the Armored core games

[2022-12-28 12:25:36] <Shirousa> there was a ladder on one of the things
[2022-12-28 12:25:36] <+invaderjr00> kek
[2022-12-28 12:25:36] <%Suwayya> Just rolled a 24 speeder. I'm so hyped  gachiW
[2022-12-28 12:25:39] <%Vapereo> @Jenazad have you considered adding the kek emote Fishinge
[2022-12-28 12:25:44] <Shirousa> one of the platforms maybe you can kick it down?
[2022-12-28 12:25:47] <Shirousa> or somethin
[2022-12-28 12:25:50] <Shirousa> nono idk which one
[2022-12-28 12:25:53] <Coental> who needs a ladder when you can fall with style
[2022-12-28 12:25:59] <Yetiapocalypse> I will say demon souls levels are probably the most hostile in the series, this is the one game I cant underestimate a random shirtless dude cause he will stun lock me for 5 seconds
[2022-12-28 12:26:01] <+invaderjr00> It’s funny cause it’s Tyler1 being alpha BigBrother
[2022-12-28 12:26:11] <nowimpanickin> @Jenazad you should check out wizard of legend. It's a roguelite and its like $5 on steam rn and it's fucking incredible
[2022-12-28 12:26:21] <Coental> no ladder needed, only style

[2022-12-28 12:28:17] <%aevism> problem with AC is that it is too focus on arena / duel battles, guess that is why it fails hard
