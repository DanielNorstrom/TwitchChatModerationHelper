[2022-12-21 16:22:35] <@%Toonfish> At this point I realized I had some hardcore yaoi hentai on my third monitor so I completely panicked and tried to close it but firefox asked me if I really wanted to close multiple tabs so I got even more flustered and misclicked "no" so I had to close it again and click "yes"

[2022-12-21 23:40:07] <%+boldCactuslad> Toonfish: The best way to eat cereal is to pour milk into your bowl, add a handful of cereal and eat ASAP. Once there is no more cereal in the bowl, add another handful. Repeat until the milk is empty or you don't want to eat anymore cereal. This way, the cereal stays suuuper crunchy, the milk stays cool giving a nice contrast to the cereal in temperature and the milk stays unflavored which is a nice contrast to the cereal flavorwise.
