[2022-12-07 20:11:44] <@%^StreamElements> I am struck by Panic. My shackles are shattered by Panic, and it grants me total emancipation. I embrace my Panic. It envelops and consumes me. Through it, I become Panic Personified! And where Panic thrives, there grows Freedom! But we must accept: The cat-streamer is gone forever.

[2022-12-07 20:43:54] <+Neddy471> They needed someone to look over the "chapstick application" because... wow, that was a thing.
[2022-12-07 20:43:56] <%clockworkcontrivance> LUL I really honestly think that the eye focus was off because they mocapped separately from the other actors, so they didnt know where to focus

[2022-12-07 20:45:59] <+Neddy471> Things can be both a capella and blues - one is an instrumentation, the other is a genre/style.
[2022-12-07 20:46:00] <mopsentmt> @LarryTheCountryWalrus Because they reuse some models from the other games, but then they make new slightly better models for characters that don't use old ones so they don't quite sync up.
[2022-12-07 20:46:02] <Anfangxs> Ngl, seen horror movies worse than this. Meh.
[2022-12-07 20:46:08] <%+scumbagpossum> It wasnt bad, but is the weakest game in the franchise so far

[2022-12-07 20:46:40] <%$Maruvanisil> because plot
[2022-12-07 20:46:44] <+LarryTheCountryWalrus> they are rolling toward the TellTale games model of tossing out too many games and slowly bankrupting themselves at least they aren't licensing a bunch of IP's
[2022-12-07 20:46:44] <%Nanoskaa> he drugged them and they were doing things in slow mo
[2022-12-07 20:46:47] <%clockworkcontrivance> it feels like they wrote a bunch of scenarios and had to string them all together at the end without enough planning
[2022-12-07 20:46:47] <%Miano_SEA> Killers were on creative mode
[2022-12-07 20:46:51] <%$Bazeio> girldmHUEHUE its nightmare from IDV he has good bird positon

[2022-12-07 20:47:10] <%barrettsmithbb> The next game should be on Unreal 5, so there "should" be some better optimizations
[2022-12-07 20:47:11] <hectop4scal> I think the implication is that du'met was munday
[2022-12-07 20:47:14] <@%$zMiyuZ> I do hope you try the previous games, they are neat
[2022-12-07 20:47:15] <%$earin_copper> I wonder if any of the scenes omitted because people were dead cover the missing movement
[2022-12-07 20:47:18] <stevietheturtle> Teleports infront of you eating a burger
[2022-12-07 20:47:20] <%+Rhipose> Why do you think he was always walking in frame? He was EXHAUSTED

[2022-12-07 22:26:17] <%the_panzerschiff> The Buckets would've exploded if they actually froze them
[2022-12-07 22:26:19] <%vic_weave> and the bricks are not mortars together in anyway
[2022-12-07 22:26:21] <dossgecko> ‚Ä¶
[2022-12-07 22:26:24] <Seagulyus> why would you use a drill for that?! you would ruin the tip
[2022-12-07 22:26:24] <%clockworkcontrivance> it would take SO long for a block that size to freeze solid
[2022-12-07 22:26:25] <%TisMyPudding> that is soft dirt
[2022-12-07 22:26:26] <%SideShot_NL> they got the budget for actual ice
[2022-12-07 22:26:27] <%+TheLawlessBandit> That would take longer than 5 minutes‚Ä¶
[2022-12-07 22:26:27] <%+Dr_Tacos138> those would be heavy af
[2022-12-07 22:26:28] <AzureSeishin> Dang they did that in 5 minutes? How cold is it to freeze water solid in large blocks that quick?!?!
[2022-12-07 22:26:29] <GarmrUSAF> first time seeing this outfit, very cute ^^
[2022-12-07 22:26:29] <ErinTheGreat27> I've said it before I'll say it again. WHO HAS THE TIME FOR THIS???
[2022-12-07 22:26:31] <zahard04> and they are supposedly making these 3 blocks at a time that has to freeze outside
[2022-12-07 22:26:31] <%barrettsmithbb> Jello
[2022-12-07 22:26:32] <%vic_weave> needs mud or snow
[2022-12-07 22:26:33] <hozy_ip> 80% sure its ice
[2022-12-07 22:26:34] <Infernal_Unic0rn> this is like five hour crafts smh
[2022-12-07 22:26:34] <valerio_b_38> E-Glue girldmWhyF
[2022-12-07 22:26:36] <Ninaninin> imagine dm, its plexiglass cubes from aliexpress
[2022-12-07 22:26:36] <Anfangxs> @Anfangxs Aren't you the guys that got sharks right at the doorstep?
[2022-12-07 22:26:36] <%+tacticalmixtape> could be salt?
[2022-12-07 22:26:38] <%Dragonator_g> That is A LOT of ice. This is getting really expensive.
[2022-12-07 22:26:38] <crw33> lot of air in that ice...
[2022-12-07 22:26:39] <anderium> They're carrying it too easily for it to be ice though
[2022-12-07 22:26:39] <%vic_weave> there it goes
[2022-12-07 22:26:42] <+Aegelward> That would b e a hella lot of resin
[2022-12-07 22:26:43] <$Minanonn> How does a man make sure his ice house is securely built?
[2022-12-07 22:26:44] <redguyx85> don't they need a keystone?
[2022-12-07 22:26:47] <+GrsViTy> oh that is NOT strong enough to support that ice, you're gonna get crushed
[2022-12-07 22:26:48] <%+Sephim> the slowest 5 minutes I've ever seen
[2022-12-07 22:26:49] <+Tedster> 5 minute igloo!
[2022-12-07 22:26:50] <%RisenPhoenix37> 5 minute crafts because you'd realise it's a stupid idea after 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 22:26:50] <%fotoply> They are just really efficient
[2022-12-07 22:26:52] <hozy_ip> could be jello
[2022-12-07 22:26:52] <batosoba> yoo, i like that model XD looks so good
[2022-12-07 22:26:55] <%Admin_Brave> why would they lie?
[2022-12-07 22:26:55] <+skip0s> Could also b plastic
[2022-12-07 22:27:01] <%NIKOvbn> LOOOOL
[2022-12-07 22:27:01] <%pepincity> it's not ice, it's Jell-o
[2022-12-07 22:27:02] <%SideShot_NL> yes a crucial step in this 5 minute build is allowing enough time for it to snow on eachnlayer to act as natural cement
[2022-12-07 22:27:02] <%+unlikelyresult> 5 mins is how long it takes to decide it's too much effort to haul giant blocks of ice around
[2022-12-07 22:27:02] <%$Bazeio> girldmLUL 5 mins, but they had to wipe the snow from top the cubes
[2022-12-07 22:27:02] <ErinTheGreat27> OH

[2022-12-07 22:27:47] <Shiva_Goddess> I think they are making a geodesic dome
[2022-12-07 22:27:48] <%Vandercat> is this one of those 5-minute crafts that takes up more than 5 minutes of the video?
[2022-12-07 22:27:48] <%NIKOvbn> oh, they are just skipping the hard part

[2022-12-07 22:27:55] <0l3j> that would be hard
[2022-12-07 22:27:56] <%RisenPhoenix37> Yeah they have 6 side pvc connectors
[2022-12-07 22:27:57] <iLovePork> Why waste so much plastic
[2022-12-07 22:27:57] <anderium> they didn't know how

[2022-12-07 22:28:09] <Orannis0> this is completely negating the insulative properties of the ice. XD
[2022-12-07 22:28:10] <%+730150> they have to keep the ice fresh
[2022-12-07 22:28:10] <%+HohenheimDeca> its a 5 min craft not a 5 week craft thats why they use wrap
[2022-12-07 22:28:10] <%Admin_Brave> they really like their film

[2022-12-07 22:36:05] <gearbear96> Nope not napalm
[2022-12-07 22:36:06] <%SideShot_NL> wait no you need to melt styrofoam in gasoline for napalm
[2022-12-07 22:36:07] <RevenantLuke> thats homemade napalm...
[2022-12-07 22:36:10] <ttardigrade> but kinda works like it
[2022-12-07 22:36:10] <%+flameburstx> Napalm was with benzene, but basically yes
[2022-12-07 22:36:10] <+unluckyphotographer> or something very close to napalm
[2022-12-07 22:36:11] <%ynlokk> @Ninaninin yeap, acetone is nail polish
[2022-12-07 22:36:14] <%$earin_copper> The DIY napalm is doing that with gasoline
[2022-12-07 22:36:15] <%+Insayden> I feel like there are extra steps

[2022-12-07 22:36:18] <%$Bazeio> girldmNoted GOOD TO KNOW
[2022-12-07 22:36:18] <skrubbeast> if it was gasoline it would be
[2022-12-07 22:36:27] <%RisenPhoenix37> Styrofoam makes stuff sticky, can put it in a molotov
[2022-12-07 22:36:27] <%+BlakeisLost> very similar to napalm
[2022-12-07 22:36:30] <%SideShot_NL> sure, what can go wrong
[2022-12-07 22:36:31] <Riot54> No, homemade napalm is gasoline and styrofoam.
[2022-12-07 22:36:31] <TheFlyingGoomba> No, but it creates a similar cling if it burns.  Keep well away from fuel.
[2022-12-07 22:36:33] <%snakeandwolf7> HAHAHAHA
[2022-12-07 22:36:34] <iLovePork> Watch lists here we go
[2022-12-07 22:36:35] <TheGameskate> no really but its burns like napalm

[2022-12-07 22:36:38] <%mattmk_ll> THICC gasoline is Napalm

[2022-12-07 22:36:41] <+DaemonMcRae> Styrofoam and gasoline is MUCH more efficient.
[2022-12-07 22:36:42] <%+flameburstx> "People are idiots" heard it here first folks
[2022-12-07 22:36:43] <valerio_b_38> @vic_weave 12 x 5 Minute Crafts in this case
[2022-12-07 22:36:45] <RevenantLuke> it burns well and sticks to stuff just like napalm. but it isnt really napalm
[2022-12-07 22:36:47] <%Melancholy_mage> Acetone fumes? Yup! Super bad. And no, it‚Äôs not napalm, but if it does burn it will stick to you and burn while sticking. It would be super nasty.
[2022-12-07 22:36:48] <Adrolien> @Ninaninin A very weak form of it yes, there are much stronger versions available from hardware stores
[2022-12-07 22:36:49] <%$Layzay73> @Ninaninin aceton was in nail polish remover but most mved away from it to my knowledge
[2022-12-07 22:36:51] <%+Rhipose> If that catches fire, it will be very very dangerous. Like if that catches fire someone will just die
[2022-12-07 22:37:00] <zahard04> so after looking it up at least where i live it would be cheaper to buy a new plastic bucket
[2022-12-07 22:37:03] <My_Oshii_Totoro> yum cancer
[2022-12-07 22:37:04] <%vic_weave> petrol or deisal would be napalm
[2022-12-07 22:37:05] <%+scumbagpossum> Yep gasoline with styrofoam balls in a bottle creates a napalm throwable bomb
[2022-12-07 22:37:09] <Footacular> Woop woop polymer suspension is so much fun
[2022-12-07 22:37:09] <Orannis0> it's basically crude napalm because it's HIGHLY flammable
[2022-12-07 22:37:10] <%makimacansteponme> nvm gas with Styrofoam is napolm
[2022-12-07 22:37:11] <+unluckyphotographer> it's a very good fire starter
[2022-12-07 22:37:11] <%jackjumbo> eto
[2022-12-07 22:37:12] <%the_panzerschiff> IT'S GOD DAMN NAPALM FOR GODS SAKE

[2022-12-07 22:37:15] <%Admin_Brave> but for goodness sake wear gloves
[2022-12-07 22:37:16] <mopsentmt> It's not napalm, but you can get a bad chemical burn from it if you are not careful (ask me how I know)
[2022-12-07 22:37:17] <%+shmangolia> why not just use Flex Tape instead?

[2022-12-07 22:42:38] <LordBlackstar> Australian winter?
[2022-12-07 22:42:39] <redguyx85> it's not pool water. it's hose water
[2022-12-07 22:42:39] <%+ieatpupies> that was not the same pool in the underwater shot
[2022-12-07 22:42:40] <%lonerimortal> why? because people who don't know will think it's cool :^V
[2022-12-07 22:42:40] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> yeah...
[2022-12-07 22:42:40] <%Kidfingamer> that needs some shock
[2022-12-07 22:42:40] <%+RNDebbo> they forgot the chlorine
[2022-12-07 22:42:41] <%+Rhipose> They love pallets
[2022-12-07 22:42:41] <%Dragonator_g> How do you then drain the pool?
[2022-12-07 22:42:43] <%Vandercat> are you telling me a stagnant body of water has some kind of health risk?
[2022-12-07 22:42:44] <%jaxmaru> thaaat wouldn't hold
[2022-12-07 22:42:48] <This_side_up_153> who needs a filter pump?
[2022-12-07 22:42:48] <%+Sephim> sure looks like winter
[2022-12-07 22:42:48] <Ninaninin> those pallets are EXPENSIVE
[2022-12-07 22:42:48] <%+Rhipose> @Rhipose LOL
[2022-12-07 22:42:49] <TheFlyingGoomba> No.  DOnt' do this.

[2022-12-07 22:42:51] <iLovePork> This feels AI generated LUL
[2022-12-07 22:42:52] <My_Oshii_Totoro> did the cement in a post with foam?
[2022-12-07 22:42:53] <+Ardygun> What normal person has pallets available to them like that?
[2022-12-07 22:42:54] <%$Bazeio> NO SUPPORT ON THE EDGES? monkaS
[2022-12-07 22:42:54] <%+Jennsun> Oh yes, expanding foam will be very supportive there
[2022-12-07 22:42:54] <+unluckyphotographer> the building inspector isn't going to be happy with that
[2022-12-07 22:42:55] <anderium> those inner screws were more harm than useful
[2022-12-07 22:42:55] <%mattmk_ll> that stuff is toxic tho
[2022-12-07 22:42:55] <TheFlyingGoomba> Please don't
[2022-12-07 22:42:57] <evil13rt> OSHA approved!
[2022-12-07 22:42:58] <Lobsteirin> Is this what pallets are for?
[2022-12-07 22:42:58] <%RisenPhoenix37> I also feel like if an environmental inspector saw that. he'd lose his mind
[2022-12-07 22:42:58] <Seagulyus> where would you even get the pallets?
[2022-12-07 22:42:59] <%+kaijin22> what happened to winter
[2022-12-07 22:43:00] <fir3_leviathan> edges don't look safe rikkuSusge
[2022-12-07 22:43:00] <+GrsViTy> Those poor pallets
[2022-12-07 22:43:03] <Polenicus> This is not how you build a deck!
[2022-12-07 22:43:04] <%+Cloudomasters> just leave the tape at that point
[2022-12-07 22:43:04] <%vic_weave> why not just keep the tape on to cut?
[2022-12-07 22:43:07] <redguyx85> you can get pallets for free
[2022-12-07 22:43:08] <%jackjumbo> we sell them for 30 USD
[2022-12-07 22:43:08] <%+scumbagpossum> Not really theyre like 30 bucks a pop
[2022-12-07 22:43:09] <%+TheLawlessBandit> Southern Hemisphere winter?
[2022-12-07 22:43:11] <dm_darius_> Oh it's a Gazebo, isn't it
[2022-12-07 22:43:11] <%+Rhipose> Why not just.. buy 2x4's.. and make this.. well.
[2022-12-07 22:43:12] <%lonerimortal> to mark probably
[2022-12-07 22:43:12] <C0UnterSapiens> EU pallets are usually for rent too
[2022-12-07 22:43:13] <+DaemonMcRae> Not really. I know a bunch of hardware stores that give them away.
[2022-12-07 22:43:13] <%GeorgePlaysTwitch> there is a pallet shortage right now btw
[2022-12-07 22:43:14] <%+Lutzio> Spray painting is RAD!
[2022-12-07 22:43:16] <SongfortheBird> why not just get a chalk line
[2022-12-07 22:43:17] <zahard04> he hasnt heard of pencil thats why
[2022-12-07 22:43:18] <crw33> he made a very bad cutting line
[2022-12-07 22:43:19] <Riot54> I have never seen pallets that look that nice.
[2022-12-07 22:43:21] <Botouls> that can't be safe
[2022-12-07 22:43:21] <%$Bazeio> Dont go into the edges btw girldmLUL
[2022-12-07 22:43:22] <%lead_solutions_supervisor> backjard mma calling it now!
[2022-12-07 22:43:23] <This_side_up_153> I would not stand on that.
[2022-12-07 22:43:24] <My_Oshii_Totoro> why not a sander?
[2022-12-07 22:43:25] <2cm2cm> these pallets are too clean
[2022-12-07 22:43:25] <%jaxmaru> 5 mins dmJAM
[2022-12-07 22:43:25] <%+snek981> free pallets suck for durability too
[2022-12-07 22:43:26] <meklund> spray painting it is worse for the environment, that's why
[2022-12-07 22:43:27] <@%$zMiyuZ> I love to do those for winter
[2022-12-07 22:43:28] <%vic_weave> most places to not give away pallets
[2022-12-07 22:43:29] <%ShadowBunnyGod> leaving tape on wont let it be 5 min
[2022-12-07 22:43:31] <%Admin_Brave> and usually a little broke
[2022-12-07 22:43:32] <redguyx85> not all of them are treated
[2022-12-07 22:43:33] <%+Sephim> they are still a lot of shortages
[2022-12-07 22:43:34] <MissJackieCR> 5 Minute Crafts started the wood shortage
[2022-12-07 22:43:38] <iLovePork> And free pallets are usually moldy
[2022-12-07 22:43:38] <+GrsViTy> no the GRASS TEH GRASS
[2022-12-07 22:43:38] <%SideShot_NL> oh thank god i thought we'd moved on to another craft
[2022-12-07 22:43:41] <Goergorion> How is this Five Minutes?!?!
[2022-12-07 22:43:41] <TheHattedKhajiit> There's a 'Everything' shortage
[2022-12-07 22:43:41] <%+GhostV2> Most pallets I've seen would just explode if you tried to sand them
[2022-12-07 22:43:43] <%Vandercat> my grandma's neighbor had a pallet yard that was full of pallets back in the day
[2022-12-07 22:43:43] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> eq
[2022-12-07 22:43:44] <%AegisOfOghma> Terrible coverage
[2022-12-07 22:43:46] <AlanaCrystal> Gotta give it a spraytan
[2022-12-07 22:43:47] <C0UnterSapiens> its bbq sauce
[2022-12-07 22:43:47] <+Tanikstheimmortal> Riiiiight ‚Äúwinter‚Äù activity and totally not a summer activity
[2022-12-07 22:43:47] VIEWERS: 1¬†379
[2022-12-07 22:43:48] <%RisenPhoenix37> Yeah 90% of the pallets I've seen are dirty/broken
[2022-12-07 22:43:52] <starwarsclone55> That's an awful way to stain wood
[2022-12-07 22:43:54] <ShadowKorsar> Why do that if you can just use proper wood...
[2022-12-07 22:43:54] <stevietheturtle> @MissJackieCR LUL
[2022-12-07 22:43:54] <TheFlyingGoomba> It makes it feel more crafty visually.   Like the PVC after all the professional equipment for the pool dig.
[2022-12-07 22:43:55] <+rickgijs> pallet and wood shortage i dont see much, at my work they just pile up always and end up in the wood container, EU pallets even
[2022-12-07 22:43:56] <@%$zMiyuZ> does not seem SAFE AT ALL
[2022-12-07 22:43:56] <theunknownswedishgamer> A little known secret, there are pallets at the park and any1 can pick them up and keep them
[2022-12-07 22:43:56] <%+ieatpupies> you know they sell boards that are better for this that you can usually get for cheaper than the amount of pallets would cost
[2022-12-07 22:43:56] <%+Rhipose> Jankiest gazzebo NA
[2022-12-07 22:43:58] <%SideShot_NL> so what are the hinges for...
[2022-12-07 22:43:59] <@%$zMiyuZ> THIS IS DANGEROUS
[2022-12-07 22:44:00] <+TheBlindAndDeaf> Thats not going to rot :)
[2022-12-07 22:44:01] <%mattmk_ll> are they making a Gondola ?
[2022-12-07 22:44:03] <iLovePork> No LUL
[2022-12-07 22:44:04] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> never did
[2022-12-07 22:44:08] <%+snek981> Jokes on you, we don't know what safety is here
[2022-12-07 22:44:08] <joseph_delaney> Sooooo mannnny splinnnters
[2022-12-07 22:44:11] <Lobsteirin> Do you have about 8 pallets laying around your house for a craft?
[2022-12-07 22:44:12] <%ynlokk> its a gazebo, in 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 22:44:12] <%AegisOfOghma> All the methods are so unsecure
[2022-12-07 22:44:13] <%$earin_copper> Oh no it's a gazebo
[2022-12-07 22:44:14] <%$Bazeio> SURE
[2022-12-07 22:44:14] <My_Oshii_Totoro> is it a gazeebo?!?!
[2022-12-07 22:44:14] <+eillera> he only has 5 minutes what do you expect?
[2022-12-07 22:44:16] <dosaki07> NotLikeThis
[2022-12-07 22:44:17] <Polenicus> It's a gazebo. They're very dangerous
[2022-12-07 22:44:18] <Bonkus_Maximus_> 5 min gazebo
[2022-12-07 22:44:18] <%vic_weave> this is why we have building codes
[2022-12-07 22:44:18] <%SideShot_NL> they build the thing with hinges, what are the hinges for?!
[2022-12-07 22:44:19] <%+Lexetle> That must be so wobbly, its only like 2 inches of dirt for support
[2022-12-07 22:44:19] <TheFlyingGoomba> And it's all held up by spray foam.
[2022-12-07 22:44:21] <%jaxmaru> Looks like they skipped some steps Kappa
[2022-12-07 22:44:21] <anderium> pretty awesome skills though
[2022-12-07 22:44:21] <Lavaros> Some ones gonna die
[2022-12-07 22:44:21] <redguyx85> he can't secure them, it will take longer than 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 22:44:22] <%Vandercat> they'd need 6 minutes to do this and secure the steps so the skipped it
[2022-12-07 22:44:23] <%+Rhipose> How many people have five minute crafts killed.
[2022-12-07 22:44:23] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> ???
[2022-12-07 22:44:24] <+SameJackson> It's 5 mins, we don't have time for safety
[2022-12-07 22:44:24] <C0UnterSapiens> and Moses did the arch also in 5 minutes

[2022-12-07 22:44:43] <Anfangxs> In Germany someone would be like: "Do you have a permit for that?"
[2022-12-07 22:44:44] <GarmrUSAF> more worried about securing the degrading palm leaves than the steps

[2022-12-07 23:00:03] <GarmrUSAF> and he just weakened the weld
[2022-12-07 23:00:03] <joseph_delaney> If you have a propane tank, surely you already likely have a grill
[2022-12-07 23:00:03] <%snakeandwolf7> YEP only 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:05] <+DaemonMcRae> Grill DMN is sad.
[2022-12-07 23:00:06] <@%$zMiyuZ> AND IT IS CHEAPER
[2022-12-07 23:00:07] <%WanderClose> I don't think we could even call this money saving since he had to own a welder just to do this
[2022-12-07 23:00:09] <Bonkus_Maximus_> why did he remove that circle in the first place
[2022-12-07 23:00:10] <iLovePork> Dont drill away the weld LUL
[2022-12-07 23:00:10] <Thexein> as someone who welds this triggers me on many levels
[2022-12-07 23:00:10] <0l3j> just buy grill it will be cheaper NotLikeThis
[2022-12-07 23:00:10] <unbalancdd> jesus than welding
[2022-12-07 23:00:11] <@%Aozora7> You know what actually takes five minutes? Buying a grill at a store
[2022-12-07 23:00:11] <%+ChickenRaptor_> all those tools are more expensive than a grill
[2022-12-07 23:00:11] <%Ishii_kun_> 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:12] <%+AstarofZero> i'm loosing braincells as this goes on

[2022-12-07 23:00:13] <+Turpiini> SURE let me just get my mig welder
[2022-12-07 23:00:13] <cement_pinata> that woman has been cursed to only use things in ways that they aren't supposed to be used aicWORRY
[2022-12-07 23:00:14] <crw33> this video is a whole lot of "NO!"
[2022-12-07 23:00:19] <%+scumbagpossum> Walmart has some for ten bucks lol
[2022-12-07 23:00:19] <dosaki07> JUST BUY ONE
[2022-12-07 23:00:19] <%SideShot_NL> remember, just 5-minutes!
[2022-12-07 23:00:19] <%Aethersen> 5minute craft btw LOL
[2022-12-07 23:00:19] <seravok> And some can even get a grill in 5 minutes LUL
[2022-12-07 23:00:20] <My_Oshii_Totoro> This isn't 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:20] <therealdragongirl> just BUY one for 50 bucks
[2022-12-07 23:00:21] <anderium> winter btw
[2022-12-07 23:00:21] <%Melancholy_mage> Why cut it out,then re weld it to then drill it? Why not just drill it and skip the welding!?
[2022-12-07 23:00:24] <AzureSeishin> The tools required to make this cost considerably more than the thing they are making...
[2022-12-07 23:00:24] <%$PhorrestGaze> 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <%vic_weave> just use that tac welder you got laying around
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <ketlo> 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <C0UnterSapiens> these pressure containers cost min 100 bucks btw
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <%Vandercat> this is perfect for the one guy who's legally not able to buy a grill but owns a metal shop
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <%snakeandwolf7> or you can make one out of stolen items
[2022-12-07 23:00:25] <Finland_Jami> saved all that 25 euros
[2022-12-07 23:00:26] <+centaurfold> but how else can you justify your welding equipment?
[2022-12-07 23:00:26] <TheHattedKhajiit> Consumerism must end,dm!
[2022-12-07 23:00:26] <%+HohenheimDeca> going to the store takes longer than 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:26] <+capture_the_lag63> lmao yeah guys this totally took only 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:27] <aliensuperweapon> It takes less time to earn the money to buy that LUL
[2022-12-07 23:00:27] <evil13rt> I must craft.
[2022-12-07 23:00:27] <+science_envisions> just learn to weld in 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:27] <%Melsa_Hvarei> I hate all of this
[2022-12-07 23:00:29] <@%$zMiyuZ> THOSE MACHINES ALONE COST WAY MORE THAN A GRILL
[2022-12-07 23:00:30] <+frozen_eggo> thats gonna be the first weld to break
[2022-12-07 23:00:31] <%+rikudawn> As a welder this hurts.
[2022-12-07 23:00:31] <%Kherbellos> But DM, he has to craft
[2022-12-07 23:00:32] <gus_1988> 5 minute grill
[2022-12-07 23:00:32] <%+VolTezx> 5 minutes btw
[2022-12-07 23:00:32] <eurotommy> but welding is fun
[2022-12-07 23:00:33] <%+sebonsky> if you can't make this in 5 minutes what is even wrong with you?
[2022-12-07 23:00:33] <%TheCanadianBeaverNS> that is a big job, and challenging and dangerous.....nope
[2022-12-07 23:00:33] <%$Pordzio> but it's not CUSTOM
[2022-12-07 23:00:34] <Ryxhen> ‚ÄúSave money on buying a grill by making your own! Welding equipment not included.‚Äù
[2022-12-07 23:00:34] <jericho_vardez> I think the fuel they expended costs more
[2022-12-07 23:00:34] <warren_fornaro> It probably costed more to make this than buying one.
[2022-12-07 23:00:36] <redguyx85> what do you mean? This is the one from Wallmart
[2022-12-07 23:00:37] <%SideShot_NL> oh sure i got a pipe bender laying around!
[2022-12-07 23:00:37] <momnc> the amount of money that the must've put into this is astounding
[2022-12-07 23:00:38] <dino_nugget_> but you can make this in five mins or less
[2022-12-07 23:00:38] <+SameJackson> But then what would he use his wielding kit for?
[2022-12-07 23:00:41] <shadon555> instead buy an orbital sander, a welder, a saw, and a pipe bender.
[2022-12-07 23:00:41] <%the_panzerschiff> This one is good ngl
[2022-12-07 23:00:41] <AzureSeishin> A PIPE BENDER
[2022-12-07 23:00:42] <%vic_weave> in that case sure
[2022-12-07 23:00:42] <+Syf_theGiver> That pipe bender is like a grand
[2022-12-07 23:00:43] <stevietheturtle> It's impressive though
[2022-12-07 23:00:47] <+Goonlord246> Yeah, lemme go use my PIPE BENDER real quick
[2022-12-07 23:00:48] <%$haurupen> this stopped being a craft the moment wielding started being used
[2022-12-07 23:00:48] <This_side_up_153> you just need an entire workshop
[2022-12-07 23:00:49] <AzureSeishin> Because everyone owns a pipe bender!?!?!
[2022-12-07 23:00:50] <fir3_leviathan> I... Must... Craft !
[2022-12-07 23:00:51] <+akt001> Why go to walmart when you can do this in 5 minutes
[2022-12-07 23:00:51] <%vic_weave> but that was a perfectly good tank
[2022-12-07 23:00:52] <+DaemonMcRae> You can afford. A PIPE BENDER. But not. A GRILL.
[2022-12-07 23:00:53] <%+Lirisu> I mean, because everyone has a pipe bender in their back yard
[2022-12-07 23:00:53] <%+Jennsun> Yeah, you're spending more on materials than if you just bought one
[2022-12-07 23:00:53] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> making waste into cool...
[2022-12-07 23:00:56] <%+Sephim> this is sooooo much work
[2022-12-07 23:00:56] <+eillera> but it only takes up 5 minutes of your time
[2022-12-07 23:00:57] <%+kaijin22> so how much of this video was winter
[2022-12-07 23:00:58] <GarmrUSAF> at least do it in a SAFE WAY
[2022-12-07 23:00:58] <evil13rt> I just happen to have a pipe bender.
[2022-12-07 23:00:59] <%+AstarofZero> this 100% takes 5 min to make
[2022-12-07 23:00:59] <shadon555> tools alone wouldve cost more than the grill
[2022-12-07 23:01:00] <%WanderClose> Who is supposed to just have all these things to?
[2022-12-07 23:01:02] <@%^StreamElements> want more girldm? for clips and highlights: https://www.youtube.com/girl_dm_ new videos weekly!
[2022-12-07 23:01:04] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> heat resistant paint indeed...
[2022-12-07 23:01:05] <%+Rhipose> Steam punk grill
[2022-12-07 23:01:05] <crw33> NO, NO, NO, NO!!!
[2022-12-07 23:01:05] <stevietheturtle> PAINT
[2022-12-07 23:01:07] <%lonerimortal> sus
[2022-12-07 23:01:07] <%+Lutzio> So this is what facebook did to us
[2022-12-07 23:01:11] <Zekewarss> i bet it cost more to get all this stuff togeather then just buying a grill
[2022-12-07 23:01:12] <TheGameskate> no just use the spare $300 air compresser tank
[2022-12-07 23:01:12] <dudeunderscoreart> more like everything they do is suspicious
[2022-12-07 23:01:13] <redguyx85> do they know how expensive a welding gun is?
[2022-12-07 23:01:17] <%SideShot_NL> i mean this is just an outsourced video to someone actually competent, their own stuff is always shoddy
[2022-12-07 23:01:18] <@%Aozora7> It looks like very step that takes 3 seconds on this video is like 10 minutes at least
[2022-12-07 23:01:20] <%vic_weave> they are so bad at spray painting things too
[2022-12-07 23:01:21] <$aimop95> Ah yes, do it myself, with my industrial tools I just have lying around my house
[2022-12-07 23:01:21] <+rickgijs> that paint gonna drip like mad
[2022-12-07 23:01:21] <%Rutherfordiomed> @kaijin22 the title
[2022-12-07 23:01:23] <ketlo> that is not the same grill
[2022-12-07 23:01:24] <%Dragonator_g> Did he grind the branding off it?
[2022-12-07 23:01:27] <%+RedShift1089> even I end up telling my very retired father NOT to do some DIY stuff because it's not worth it, tho
[2022-12-07 23:01:28] <%+Rhipose> Now hear me out. Why don't just BUY ONE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS
[2022-12-07 23:01:28] <warren_fornaro> THAT IS NOT THE ONE HE MAD3
[2022-12-07 23:01:28] <%+AstarofZero> damn i can do this in 5 min 100%
[2022-12-07 23:01:29] <mopsentmt> That's galvanized! if he doesn't remove the coating he's going to get welder's lung!
[2022-12-07 23:01:32] <%$Pordzio> put the grate over the bucket?
[2022-12-07 23:01:32] <%jaxmaru> good grief that paint.
[2022-12-07 23:01:35] <+Turpiini> I mean... It's nice but...
[2022-12-07 23:01:37] <no_aim_just_shame> I'd give 20.000 dollars to have their workshop. Which is exactly what their tools would cost SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2022-12-07 23:01:39] <+frozen_eggo> did they jsut waist meat girldmSusF
[2022-12-07 23:01:40] <Dracoraz> that doesn't seem food safe
[2022-12-07 23:01:40] <C0UnterSapiens> no 5 minuting the coal?
[2022-12-07 23:01:41] <+DaemonMcRae> THE STEAK COSTS MORE THAN THE GRILL
[2022-12-07 23:01:43] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> how much it cost for a cheap grill
[2022-12-07 23:01:45] <warren_fornaro> THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S THE SAME GRILL
[2022-12-07 23:01:47] <Ksiraan> its probably for cheapskates
[2022-12-07 23:01:49] <%AegisOfOghma> Not food safe
[2022-12-07 23:01:51] <+the1hotjojo> i had to prove im a man by making my own grill

[2022-12-07 23:02:02] <+unluckyphotographer> a cheap grill would cost you about 15 dollars
[2022-12-07 23:02:02] <%RisenPhoenix37> Yeah I feel like there's some proper heat treating missing here
[2022-12-07 23:02:04] <stevietheturtle> @aimop95 Dont you? Kappa
[2022-12-07 23:02:07] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> he used a propane tank to make that right
[2022-12-07 23:02:10] <+frozen_eggo> I mean it can be just really hope none of it is made with aluminum
[2022-12-07 23:02:11] <+Turpiini> @no_aim_just_shame whaat mig welder is an everyday household item Kappa

[2022-12-07 23:02:18] <polite_pirate89> KEKW
[2022-12-07 23:02:18] <AzureSeishin> So all you need to make this is a bunch of scrap metal in specific shapes, an extremely expensive welding too, and and extremely expensive pipe bender.

[2022-12-07 23:02:19] <TheGameskate> that tank costs $300

[2022-12-07 23:02:26] <TheBronzeKn33Cap> cheaper than I thought
[2022-12-07 23:02:27] <joseph_delaney> 5 minute L

[2022-12-07 23:02:32] <Riot54> @TheBronzeKn33Cap It looked like a brand new air tank.
[2022-12-07 23:02:34] <anderium> buy a whole metal welding kit, that's cheaper
[2022-12-07 23:02:34] <therealdragongirl> ligit same thing
[2022-12-07 23:02:34] <%+RedShift1089> the meat is easily more expensive than some grills

[2022-12-07 23:02:38] <verticalslash> GIRL HOW MUCH IS HEAT RESISTANT PAINT
[2022-12-07 23:02:39] <%vic_weave> that's probably less than the cost to rent a welder

[2022-12-07 23:20:45] <Comradish> yes
[2022-12-07 23:20:46] <Footacular> Always make sure to look directly at the weld with no protection

[2022-12-07 23:20:53] <SkyTorisuna> I
[2022-12-07 23:20:54] <NicHartley> It depends on the metal in my long and storied experience cementing metal to metal
[2022-12-07 23:20:55] <%+TxGkJoker> i'd say pretty stuck
[2022-12-07 23:20:57] <verticalslash> not for a while. depends if moisture gets in there or not

[2022-12-07 23:21:01] <%Dragonator_g> Cement is good at compression, but bad at tension. So if you pull on it, it will crack.
