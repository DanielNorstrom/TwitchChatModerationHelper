[2022-12-21 16:22:14] <@%^Nightbot> This giant hole is for a giant Wither Skeleton farm. The hole was started in December 2019, but got sidetracked. This was cleared BY HAND (and a lot of repairing of tools). This hole's chunks were generated before the 1.16 update, before Netherite was a thing (SO no netherite was found in the hole). Jon did not copy Ph1lza, this is "standard" practice of clearing every spawn surface for a spawn farm. The floor is spawn protected via a layer of glass.

[2022-12-21 16:42:08] <!%Kaladas_> 3 edged knives where originally designed for getting through wool coats and not getting stuck. But where modified to be used to create wounds that could not be stitched up and would go septic. Creating a drain on medical resources. Sure, other things could/should be banned, but IMO when the 3 blade knife ban came out, it made sense

Now with the single digit weather coming, and being in south Texas, with no heating system... Im about to relive 2021 all over again. Northerners, laugh all you want, but it simply is the worst thing to happen in Texas. Wish me luck, im going to run to the store while there is still food on the shelves.
