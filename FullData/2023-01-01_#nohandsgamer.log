[2023-01-01 00:01:57] <BakedZnake> just play green cards and go face, how hard can it be?
[2023-01-01 00:01:58] <huntstv> I'm sure you'll get asked this 1,00000000000 times, but what do you think will be best decks for a quick legend climb next week?
[2023-01-01 00:01:59] <zeroxhaust> what rank for 11 stars? ^
[2023-01-01 00:01:59] <ThisSilhouetteLie> monsanto still plays? haven't heard that name for a while
[2023-01-01 00:02:13] <+cinnamonchair> @zeroxhaust i was about 1959
[2023-01-01 00:02:14] <huntstv> also sorry for asking the question that you will be asked a million times

[2023-01-01 00:02:30] <redrumiv> @NoHandsGamer have said anything about nerfs soon ?
[2023-01-01 00:02:30] <%+Rowdypotato> Damn throwing some bars out right njow my guy lol

[2023-01-01 00:02:54] <huntstv> my 2 most succesful dekcs have been curse imp lock and beast hunter :( and I loved ramp druid until they took away spreading plague
[2023-01-01 00:02:56] <jjrodriguezmayo> @huntstv its always hunter and aggro mage
[2023-01-01 00:03:09] <+dickard27> this deck is way too hard for not enough pay off IMO
[2023-01-01 00:03:17] <zeroxhaust> @cinnamonchair nice, congrats
[2023-01-01 00:03:25] <+cinnamonchair> ty
[2023-01-01 00:03:30] <+cinnamonchair> it izz wat it izzz
[2023-01-01 00:03:40] <BakedZnake> you ppl arent going to be happy till everything is nerfed to be 1/1s BabyRage
[2023-01-01 00:03:41] <+dickard27> its just that DH feels like it has more options and is easier
[2023-01-01 00:04:03] <+Ninjamonkcy> What are we even nerfing? There are a lot of strong things
[2023-01-01 00:04:03] <grimBleeper> PepoG murloc time
[2023-01-01 00:04:08] <%JonsyBones> Funny how many expansions it took for DH to be good
[2023-01-01 00:04:11] <+dickard27> aggro druid
[2023-01-01 00:04:13] <huntstv> this month I managed legend day 3 with beast hunter. But every other time before that I wasn't able to do it until about the middle of the month because I'm bad
[2023-01-01 00:04:19] <+dickard27> last 2 seasons for me aggro druid has gotten me to legend
[2023-01-01 00:04:21] <+cinnamonchair> nah if you want legend easily play control warrior Kappa
[2023-01-01 00:04:24] <%+BadGuff> like big spell mage or beast hunter?
[2023-01-01 00:04:35] <%+Minialtec> nerf all cards
[2023-01-01 00:04:36] <+chuuwire> simple. revert renathal
[2023-01-01 00:04:37] <%+Minialtec> imagine the dust
[2023-01-01 00:04:39] <douglaslfc> just nerf the devs at this point Kappa
[2023-01-01 00:04:43] <%+The_monster_hunter> They have to nerf too many things, bringing renathal back might be easier
[2023-01-01 00:04:43] <%+soccernerd22> no minion dh says tempo is overrated
[2023-01-01 00:04:48] <dendaihs> tempo is also good to learn fundamentals
[2023-01-01 00:04:49] VIEWERS: 770
[2023-01-01 00:04:52] <ThisSilhouetteLie> just learn the game guys and stop asking for the easy stuff, learn fundamentals
[2023-01-01 00:04:52] <Lightnin_g> happy new year everyone :)
[2023-01-01 00:05:01] <drjikiniki> as long they nerf something because this meta is not it
[2023-01-01 00:05:04] <%JonsyBones> reject modern HS, return to Grand Tournament
[2023-01-01 00:05:08] <+Ninjamonkcy> If Renathal is unnerfed, it's just too strong with some decks
[2023-01-01 00:05:13] <BakedZnake> think all your grunting between plays scare them off monkaS

[2023-01-01 00:06:17] <BakedZnake> @GuildChatter then play beast hunter then
[2023-01-01 00:06:28] <%+GuildChatter> @GuildChatter I'm mean design wise

I can't use a keyboard and mouse without severe pain. Luckily, I discovered hands-free technology as a way to control my computer. I may have the slowest APM in the business. My disability doesn't hold me back in hearthstone, though it may create some amusing moments when I can't click fast enough."2020 update: !nohandsbetter

[2023-01-01 01:37:59] <khuchten> NHG is tired, he forgot he is supposed to explode top hero not bottom :(
[2023-01-01 01:38:10] <mammadalten99> @Xeath5 Thanks :)

[2023-01-01 01:38:19] <%+Xeath5> could even be in 10 days
[2023-01-01 01:38:23] <%+Xeath5> who knows
[2023-01-01 01:38:27] <%+DrEvil69I> top hero exploding was last years meta, new years meta is explode bottom hero
[2023-01-01 01:38:27] <dendaihs> @mammadalten99 nobody does. The people who would be making nerfs are on vacation for holiday
[2023-01-01 01:38:28] <SpykoNukov> @Xeath5 why in 3weeks ? wouldn't that almost be mini set time ?
