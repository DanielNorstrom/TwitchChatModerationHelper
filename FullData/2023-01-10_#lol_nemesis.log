[2023-01-10 14:50:29] <!j0sh1g4> Msi has 2 teams from each region
[2023-01-10 14:50:37] <!j0sh1g4> Complete double ellim
[2023-01-10 14:50:42] <!j0sh1g4> For worlds

[2023-01-10 14:51:06] <!j0sh1g4> You get to knockout if once you get 3 wins
[2023-01-10 14:51:12] <!j0sh1g4> And are out at 3 losses
[2023-01-10 14:51:14] <!j0sh1g4> Bo1
[2023-01-10 14:51:17] <!j0sh1g4> But all qualifying or elimination games are bo3
[2023-01-10 14:51:18] <!j0sh1g4> Knockout stays the same
[2023-01-10 14:52:22] <!j0sh1g4> So no team can get eliminated by losing a bo1

Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of being friends with a streamer, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic. later Libido
