[2023-01-02 20:26:42] <$Ducket__> But if everything’s virtual there’s no consequence if you loose so they would never end

[2023-01-02 21:11:21] <Naliina> That's very sweet of you Nightpowered!
[2023-01-02 21:11:32] <%AslanGrants> Well, from what I recall, that kind of tattoo can have a different meaning
[2023-01-02 21:11:35] <!%admiral_frostbite> How does one get that job?
[2023-01-02 21:11:35] <%ArkRavenVT> Tattoos sound cool. I'm still thinking about getting one myself.
[2023-01-02 21:11:44] <!%admiral_frostbite> Where do I apply?
[2023-01-02 21:11:50] <%$huntsman_of_atlas> I was thinking ok putting the “word dragon” on my shoulder
[2023-01-02 21:11:52] <Naliina> Also, if I may... never assume what a tattoo means. You just can't know. People adore giving tattoo's meanings, don't. Ask but never assume.

[2023-01-02 21:16:22] <+co_rekt> context probably matters too, to clue you into whether you're supposed to read the symbol one way or the other
[2023-01-02 21:16:31] <de4dm4nw4lkin> now i know to avoid them like a tie on a doorknob.

[2023-01-02 22:24:54] <Naliina> Somewhat interesting question that pricked into my brain now that you mentioned shapeshifting.
[2023-01-02 22:24:54] <guradawn> raivComfy
[2023-01-02 22:25:12] <Naliina> if we COULD, which we can't... but if we COULD shapeshift into another creature... would we still be human?
[2023-01-02 22:25:19] <%+dobbe200102> with how boring life can be I think shap shifting into something else would be a welcome change of pace for many

[2023-01-02 22:26:58] <Naliina> So your flesh and DNA is still human
[2023-01-02 22:27:05] <Naliina> but you basically flesh-shaped into a dog, for the sake of this example.
[2023-01-02 22:27:07] <Naliina> Correct?
[2023-01-02 22:27:32] <auditory_breaker02> personally I would love to shape shift into my fursona, an arctic fox
