[2022-12-08 22:51:59] <the_punpun> yes
[2022-12-08 22:52:02] <%clockworkcontrivance> reko took quite a back seat role in this death game. I'm wondering if it was just because she got so much focus last chapter or if it's because they had to write scenes that could fit either Alice or Reko
[2022-12-08 22:52:06] <BlazingLy3261> Eh?

[2022-12-08 22:52:30] <%Melancholy_mage> So what we’re learning is…in a life or death situation, it’s better not to be liked by DM, or you’re very likely to die.

[2022-12-08 22:52:36] <%DedlokPM> @Lavaros yes

[2022-12-08 22:52:41] <Zickhart> you would think bringing the more "capable" character to next part would make more sense right?

[2022-12-08 23:56:45] <animate_acumen> lava is mostly solid, you don't really sink like that

[2022-12-08 23:57:32] <%SideShot_NL> cool
[2022-12-08 23:57:37] <%Dragonator_g> With that much lava around I doubt they could even breathe, if not because of the toxic gases, then because of the heat.
