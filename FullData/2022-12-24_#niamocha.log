[2022-12-24 06:10:42] <@%RecklessPancake> used to drink 3-4 bang energys a day

[2022-12-24 06:11:09] VIEWERS: 139
[2022-12-24 06:11:18] <FurnishedHydra> the caffeine causes sleep disturbances tho, like literally what you described. waking up not feeling rested, etc. so it might be doing more than you realize. just the two cents of an old lady.
[2022-12-24 06:12:23] <%Jazzymanz> i thought thats only if i consume too much and too late in the day
[2022-12-24 06:12:31] <%Jazzymanz> i drink it when i wake up and nothing for the rest of the day
