[2023-01-10 03:06:03] <+jiaoe> Bob and Gary were two very different people. Gary was an outgoing, confident, and daring individual. Bob was more introverted, shy, and reserved. When the two were together, sparks flew.  Bob was the first to make a move. He stepped closer to Gary and leaned in, lips gently brushing.. Gary initially froze, but soon melted into the kiss. He allowed himself to get lost in the moment and the sensations that Bob's kiss brought.  The two broke apart, but their connection was permanent.

[2023-01-10 04:20:39] <teqqyjr> Rated is on a heater run
[2023-01-10 04:20:45] <@%itbeHatfield> an NFL team is full off NFL talent. only half of Georgia would make it in the NFL.
[2023-01-10 04:20:53] <+grundlebaron> bears could lose that game
[2023-01-10 04:21:09] <%+the_roarke> Is it the whole chat trippin or the one guy who thinks college kids could actually beat professionals lmao
[2023-01-10 04:21:18] <%+jt_b4891> Georgia has what 5-10 players they get drafted. maybe 1 or 22 actually turn into something..
[2023-01-10 04:21:27] <+NeeksAgain> Play the La Chona Hardstyle Remix to throw them off lol

[2023-01-10 04:21:42] <%ElPorkChap0> did with 36
[2023-01-10 04:21:44] <%+likeliterally_> @the_roarke NFL has like the lowest average player age the majority of the NFL is right out of college
[2023-01-10 04:22:05] <+grundlebaron> bears roster is full of ppl no business being pros
[2023-01-10 04:22:24] <%sw7yy> Was rated in this lobby?
[2023-01-10 04:22:26] <%ThatLarsGuy> that was so tough to watch, so much potential for that one

[2023-01-10 04:23:20] <%+the_roarke> @likeliterally_ that's fine not sure if that's true or not, but over half of Georgia won't even make it to the NFL so still wouldn't be close
[2023-01-10 04:23:28] <%knuckifyoubuck608> @likeliterally_ wrong have to be in college 3 years before you can enter the draft, no other sport does that
[2023-01-10 04:23:43] <%ThatLarsGuy> @fogell1 yup
[2023-01-10 04:23:55] <+grundlebaron> i bet over half georgia starters go pro
[2023-01-10 04:23:56] <%+the_roarke> Yeah NBA is 19 right?
[2023-01-10 04:23:56] <%+likeliterally_> @knuckifyoubuck608 the nfl has the shortest career span.
