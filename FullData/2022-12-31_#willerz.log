[2022-12-31 13:43:19] <%+Valicanos> 2hr per drop
[2022-12-31 13:43:31] <8blackwhite8> hey guys did you know willerz was good at hard core parkour

[2022-12-31 13:43:41] <%+Valicanos> 5 drops, so 10hrs total
[2022-12-31 13:43:45] <postiveattitude> 10
[2022-12-31 13:43:51] <+pilkis111> drops are such a scam though, 11h for some screws and bolts lol. but it does bring the people to the game...
[2022-12-31 13:43:52] <%+bkenny23> What are in all the drops
[2022-12-31 13:43:54] <8blackwhite8> what's a riktok?

[2022-12-31 13:44:35] <%+Valicanos> @2L33Zy get a Datsun 240z instead, sexy
[2022-12-31 13:44:35] <%+Glorygasim> @2L33Zy should prolly just get a 240
[2022-12-31 13:44:40] <+pilkis111> worst part, you need to claim every few hours, so they make you to be  thinking about the game even if you leave a stream open
[2022-12-31 13:44:47] <8blackwhite8> the valkyrie queen was a whore so ... that was neat lol

[2022-12-31 18:59:15] <%Deezil_Wood> It would be cool if you could change what's playing on the TV and radio in the hideout.  Maybe you could play those video cassettes and get some temporary skill boost or learn a new craft or something.

[2022-12-31 19:11:23] <@%^Nightbot> WillerZ currently does not use the Binaural audio, in his opinion it's not ready yet and a bit buggy. He uses the old/normal game audio :)

[2022-12-31 19:18:51] <sseemour> @Kingblockrunner so.. if you want early wipe PVP, you want dayz IMO, not Tarkov. Again it's my opinion and more unpopular than your reddit regurtation no offense. We can agree to disagree.
[2022-12-31 19:18:53] <+nkryptik> is the audio actually fixed or is it gonna break frametimes again??

[2022-12-31 19:45:56] <+shagbeme> my AMD ryzen 7 4800h hits 100c at all times while playing rarkov lmao
[2022-12-31 19:45:58] <Keulenkonrad___> @Keulenkonrad___ learn more about cpus. i9 stand for more cores for streaming. 9900 and 12xxx says ur generation. so willerz is on 12th generation

[2022-12-31 22:05:11] <+ChuckDeezy> Scav queue times make scavving not really worth it
[2022-12-31 22:05:18] <%Reap3r1G> Ah okay I have 7, so keep em then?
[2022-12-31 22:05:20] <+OfficialBobert1693> @southsidesmalliez Scav runs are a good way to learn things about the maps. Plus you can get out with good loot
[2022-12-31 22:05:23] <+BazHicks> @ChuckDeezy scav queue times are fine for me
[2022-12-31 22:05:24] <%The_Frontline_> @Zpanks I heard the shot next to me he missed and then I got hit and fell over
[2022-12-31 22:05:27] <+ItsDooMTime> @mxghe same

[2022-12-31 22:05:31] <@%^Nightbot> why not?
[2022-12-31 22:05:38] <+WyzeGuy55> @ChuckDeezy spam invite other scavs in lobby to get faster queue times. Solo scav takes ages
[2022-12-31 22:05:48] <+Fried_SR1MP> @Reap3r1G If you don't need them right now I'd sell them if the prices are high, lots of people haven't hit flee yet so prices will drop soon

[2022-12-31 22:35:20] <huego3> has anyone turned of binural audio off?
[2022-12-31 22:35:25] <dyno3570> @defianceordishonor just for the stash upgrade...I bought the mid grade of the game so it's useless.
[2022-12-31 22:35:29] <+valdorianfps> hmmm maybe
[2022-12-31 22:35:34] <%$DaPaesh> @huego3 Will has XD

[2022-12-31 22:35:44] <@%^Nightbot> WillerZ currently does not use the Binaural audio, in his opinion it's not ready yet and a bit buggy. He uses the old/normal game audio :)
[2022-12-31 22:35:49] <%squidwardstesticals> @huego3 yes didn’t notice a lot of difference tbh but it supposedly better
[2022-12-31 22:35:51] <%JDiamatti> I turned off binaural audio and honestly don't notice a huge difference

[2022-12-31 22:36:27] <@%^Nightbot> WillerZ is currently not using PostFX, he has his Digital vibrance at 75 and Gamma at 1.4 in Nvidia Control panel. Everything else in control panel is default NODDERS
[2022-12-31 22:36:32] <puresodacad> Recently bsg "fixed" binaural audio, it shouldn't effect the game nearly as much now.
[2022-12-31 22:36:34] <%lXxAdubxXl> @WillerZ is not a human
[2022-12-31 22:36:36] <huego3> Yeah I heard it makes a huge difference but you guys says different

[2022-12-31 23:33:58] <+itsKrissBruh> @ceo_synk Ive had wierd audio everywhere from my expeience
[2022-12-31 23:34:00] <+Sturke_> Audio? Whats that?
[2022-12-31 23:34:00] <ceo_synk> I mean its worse in general
[2022-12-31 23:34:03] <+Waitqt> yea interchange is wild with audio rn
[2022-12-31 23:34:03] <coseyfannitutti> @pilkis111 it's because dollars are 66 roubles now instead of 110 like it was most of last wipe
[2022-12-31 23:34:03] <%+Sui_i2> yea interchange is real bad lately
[2022-12-31 23:34:04] <Messin> I would pay money for the old audio
[2022-12-31 23:34:04] <BuckNasty03XX> I love watching a stream where a chat is all saying, "tarkov has the best audio!!!". lmao

[2022-12-31 23:34:04] <ceo_synk> but like streets specifically I hear people right next to me and then I see them 100m away
[2022-12-31 23:34:04] <+itsKrissBruh> I never felt like the audio was that bad I'm surpised they felt th eneed to change it at all
[2022-12-31 23:34:04] <gremlin3000> I actually feel like the new audio could be great once refined
[2022-12-31 23:34:05] <Jahango> i like the gun shot sounds now but everything else can switch back to old
[2022-12-31 23:34:06] <%totallyn0tNSA> @ceo_synk same on interchange
