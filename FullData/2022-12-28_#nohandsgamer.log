[2022-12-28 00:23:23] <khuchten> We would see a lot of nerf reverts in an ideal world but we just dont see them, 90% of changes are nerf only.
[2022-12-28 00:23:40] <Elijahhhgaming> play mine and win every game
[2022-12-28 00:23:41] <%+Xeath5> i mean i had fun in stormwind playing smorc shaman
[2022-12-28 00:23:44] <%+Xeath5> i know what fast metas are like
[2022-12-28 00:23:56] <%+The_monster_hunter> Blizzard just isn't that good at predicting what effect buffs and nerfs will have on the meta
[2022-12-28 00:24:07] <orcchan> playing against wildbeast
[2022-12-28 00:24:13] <+joseph_thompsonn> @The_monster_hunter cause they dont play their own game KEKW

[2022-12-28 00:25:19] <%rexmkh> @NoHandsGamer have you seen the degen abusive sergeant version of this deck?
[2022-12-28 00:25:59] <+chuuwire> I imagine they'll just mass nerf burn. I dont see them reverting renathal, unfortunately
[2022-12-28 00:26:11] <%+Xeath5> i dont really know
[2022-12-28 00:26:15] <%+Xeath5> do people like the meta or not?
[2022-12-28 00:26:22] <%+Xeath5> maybe the goal is to compete with marvel snap
[2022-12-28 00:26:23] <Bilwitz> they're afraid to nerf alot and it keeps biting them in hte ass
[2022-12-28 00:26:24] <%+The_monster_hunter> The weird thing is that they KNOW hes one of the most impactful cards but they don't understand how he is
[2022-12-28 00:26:24] <+Salty1337> no man, you are right.
[2022-12-28 00:26:28] <%+Xeath5> so we get the stormwind meta
[2022-12-28 00:26:31] <%+kakademona87> I wish I could see player numbers before and after renathal nerf
[2022-12-28 00:26:31] <%haoxus_wayne> they need to rotate decks to get people to buy packs
[2022-12-28 00:26:32] <%SoRefreshing> I want more in depth games, it feels silly racing to combo kill on turn 6/7/8 every game
[2022-12-28 00:26:35] <%+saa_soli> renthal was always going to be temporary though. if it wasn't 35 health we'd eventually all be back to 30 at some point soon
[2022-12-28 00:26:47] <%+Xeath5> i mean its not that fast... just not that many decks to play i think
[2022-12-28 00:26:48] <100kCJ> I'm just a bill, sittin on capitol hill
[2022-12-28 00:27:06] <+Dazlidorne> Has anyone noticed that Pepsi bottles are getting harder to open lately or am I just getting weaker?

[2022-12-28 00:27:20] <khuchten> @Dazlidorne KEKW
[2022-12-28 00:27:26] <%rexmkh> i will say that someone that only has a few hours to play hs a day, the faster meta is nice in terms of the number of games I'm able to play
[2022-12-28 00:27:28] <%+The_monster_hunter> That might be a you problem dawg @Dazlidorne KEKW
[2022-12-28 00:27:31] <100kCJ> Blizz heard about your priest mirrors. Games cant go that long
[2022-12-28 00:27:35] <+rblhc> @saa_soli its not true renthal is big part of wild meta and now that meta sucks to
[2022-12-28 00:27:56] <+Salty1337> the problem is that some of the cards were made and balanced around renathal. We didn't have a period where they slowly shifted us back to a 30 health meta They just randomly took it out and we have a bunch of decks that kill you from 30 from hand.
[2022-12-28 00:28:19] <%haoxus_wayne> so they power creeped burn, but not the 30 face hp
[2022-12-28 00:28:31] <EloGiggIe> its very easy to fix the meta all they have to do is buff execute shield slam armorsmith brawl shieldmaiden rancor whirlwind frozen buckler obsidiansmith fiery war axe frothing berserker shield block snowed in darius crowley gorehowl and lothar
[2022-12-28 00:29:14] <+Salty1337> 3 mana from the depths please yes

[2022-12-28 00:29:18] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-28 00:29:18] <+chuuwire> the problem i noticed the most is that there's always an absense of a solid option for every playstyle (aggro, mid range, control) and that has caused massive inbalance in the game. Maybe i'm wrong but it feels that way
[2022-12-28 00:29:30] <100kCJ> Certain classes can start with armor, like bgs
[2022-12-28 00:29:31] <%+The_monster_hunter> just print a warrior card that says  Start of Game: Destroy the enemy hero meta solved
[2022-12-28 00:29:35] <cizuss> battle rage, bloodboil brute and the 3 mana copy a damaged minion, please

[2022-12-28 00:30:56] <EloGiggIe> the way to fix the meta is to revert drekthar trust me bro

[2022-12-28 00:31:29] <+Salty1337> Yes you are right. They needed to shift us slowly back to the 30 health meta and bringing back all the crazy burn decks down a bit.

[2022-12-28 00:31:37] <+Salty1337> I hate this meta seriously
[2022-12-28 00:31:44] <+chuuwire> if so im switching the marvel snap
[2022-12-28 00:31:44] <Elijahhhgaming> i like this meta it's kinda balanced expect warrior being a none class
[2022-12-28 00:31:53] <%+The_monster_hunter> I definitely prefer a meta where control is viable at least
[2022-12-28 00:31:59] <ejvald> But most tier 1 decks weren't renethal decks before the nerf....
[2022-12-28 00:32:08] <+rblhc> Sunnken was S tier Nathria was A tier and now...
[2022-12-28 00:32:10] <Bilwitz> i liked the last meta -80% of my games being Rogue or Druid

[2022-12-28 00:32:54] <%rexmkh> it felt like blood dks never died during the renethal meta. at least that has changed
[2022-12-28 00:32:59] <+chuuwire> yeah times to unistall
[2022-12-28 00:33:00] <%+The_monster_hunter> Renathal should have been in a later patch to see how the meta would shift with him still in it
[2022-12-28 00:33:00] <tromic> the viewership doesn't agree. viewership says this year was awful for hearthstone
[2022-12-28 00:33:04] <%Devilseye44> Sunken control warrior meta was probably the best meta .... but Blizzard always murders warrior when the class is somewhat good for two weeks
[2022-12-28 00:33:06] <foghi8> maybe hearthstone is reaching its last stand
[2022-12-28 00:33:09] <foghi8> sad

[2022-12-28 02:48:39] <Giannhs1998> this game is fake news
[2022-12-28 02:48:44] <Magnarn1> was sinful brand always this good but just a sleeper?
[2022-12-28 02:48:48] <Tenpe> your opponent is brb breaking his keyboard

[2022-12-28 02:49:05] <Zaxlor> @Magnarn1 It didn't have the new 4 cost "deal 4, summon rushers" to help it
[2022-12-28 02:49:11] <titan_plays4u> the counter to this deck is blood deathknight and warrior
[2022-12-28 02:49:11] <+piecell> It‚Äôs good now, because of the meta
[2022-12-28 02:49:13] <grimBleeper> some people were playing sinful quest last expansion but it was very niche
[2022-12-28 02:49:16] <+piecell> That‚Äôs all that counts
[2022-12-28 02:49:32] <tromic> So they should remove rush from the game got it
[2022-12-28 02:49:37] <+Finalstan_HS> I always thought Brand had massive potential

[2022-12-28 02:50:00] <+piecell> It was playable pre patch, just significantly worse than dimensions deck
[2022-12-28 02:50:02] <Zaxlor> @Finalstan_HS Same. Reminds me of a Magic card. I'm glad it's gotten support now
[2022-12-28 02:50:07] <Muffinbotx> the new meta is to run minions that have 1 health to counter dh
[2022-12-28 02:50:27] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> don‚Äôt forget everyone is forced to run 30 health now
[2022-12-28 02:50:28] <Magnarn1> so rush warrior actually broke the game is the theory?
[2022-12-28 02:50:32] <BatrachosHS> shitty meta Sadge
[2022-12-28 02:50:38] <+therealstarlightsg> i have actually seen blood dks heart striking their own body baggers to avoid giving me 12 damage when im playing dh
[2022-12-28 02:50:39] <+piecell> Unironically is it correct to damage your own minions low vs DH @muffinbotx
[2022-12-28 02:50:48] <Scotty_Do> isnt the bigger core problem mana cheat?
[2022-12-28 02:50:50] <Diapsalma> Turn 5 lethal is ok in some circumstances. But from hand and not played any minions is just toxic.
[2022-12-28 02:51:01] <+turd__fergason> my wife's boyfriend told me all minions should have charge
[2022-12-28 02:51:03] <tromic> You loved playing garrote rogue stop lying
[2022-12-28 02:51:11] <m0nty> last opponent did kind of bring the death upon himself by playing a minion thoughts
[2022-12-28 02:51:14] <Giannhs1998> we need Skipper back nohands
[2022-12-28 02:51:24] <hosunglol> are you gonna play a warlock otk deck

[2022-12-28 02:51:42] <GronminHots> Just to counter stuff like this
[2022-12-28 02:51:44] <+piecell> @scotty_do the mana cheat is always part of the problem, but not the solution? If that makes sense. Bless priest is still playable is a good example

[2022-12-28 02:51:59] <+piecell> The problem is availability of counter play
[2022-12-28 02:52:01] <segir187> to be fair, decks like this are probably the most fun to watch, at least at tournaments
[2022-12-28 02:52:08] <+apaliuna> they shouldnt have killed control decks‚Ä¶
[2022-12-28 02:52:11] <tromic> @iamthetacostand that is because your wifes boyfriend has a big dick
[2022-12-28 02:52:14] <GronminHots> Even if it was T3/4
[2022-12-28 02:52:15] <PaladinIRL> I am really enjoying the unhinged turn 5 lethal nohands EleGiggle
[2022-12-28 02:52:15] <+HouseTM> the current 30 cards control warrior is not bad at all
[2022-12-28 02:52:16] <Giannhs1998> Reynand knew all along burn cards were busted but we never listened
[2022-12-28 02:52:31] <+therealstarlightsg> @apaliuna but then how would a hearthstone game be playable in the time it takes to use the toilet?!

[2022-12-28 02:52:44] <+rrr4883> does druid not deal with these types of decks?
[2022-12-28 02:52:46] <%+kakademona87> they should make warrior only control class, then remove warrior :)
[2022-12-28 02:52:52] <+piecell> Anubrakan nerf was stupid

[2022-12-28 03:06:37] <+ThavmaHS> i think just by banning brann and not nerfing renathal would of changed the meta too no?
[2022-12-28 03:06:44] <GronminHots> @Dtkaze cause most of the HS team is filled with people from the community who used to play nothing but miracle rogue that would do that every game, so that's all they know Kappa

[2022-12-28 03:14:48] <+AComcastEmployee> yes, for sure monkaW (now give me back my family)
[2022-12-28 03:14:51] <%anch> Yes
[2022-12-28 03:14:57] <%Arkarku> base health should be 40, and renathal should make your health 50. thoughts?
[2022-12-28 03:14:58] <%+kakademona87> this expansion was supposed to be amazing and they made it bad lol
[2022-12-28 03:14:58] <%+dawgsem> @NoHandsGamer would druid be good in a meta with so much dh?
[2022-12-28 03:15:01] <Giannhs1998> "dont nerf guff, rotation will fix standard"
[2022-12-28 03:15:05] <photon_hs> could also be 35 cards 35 health so the sacrifice of consistency is less
[2022-12-28 03:15:08] <GronminHots> @NoHandsGamer I agree, but we said the same about snowfall and they are still working on nerfing those cards from the snowfall fallout
[2022-12-28 03:15:08] <%Penguin_Edd> I think they should give us 45 health
[2022-12-28 03:15:13] <%+Razorbam> I want a card who said: "You have 100 HP and 100 cards in your deck" Kappa
[2022-12-28 03:15:18] <AFCARD> buff 50 health 50 cards
[2022-12-28 03:15:24] <+Dtkaze> I don't like how bloated renathal makes decks
[2022-12-28 03:15:29] <%+shanevapid> Renethal changed everyone‚Äôs expectations for game length. Now a regular aggro meta seems insanely fast by comparison.
[2022-12-28 03:15:31] <+Dtkaze> I'm ok with 40 health but not 40 cards

[2022-12-28 03:15:53] <grimBleeper> Kappa make it 20 health and 60 cards but you can have 4 copies of any card
[2022-12-28 03:15:57] <%+Razorbam> 10 HP and 10 cards
[2022-12-28 03:16:00] <%+Razorbam> Kappa
[2022-12-28 03:16:02] <Zuranthium> renathal clearly should be 34 cards and health to match up with the 3/4 stats
[2022-12-28 03:16:03] <+AnduinCubed> Renethal should be buffed to 35/35
[2022-12-28 03:16:22] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> 30 health 30 cards seems fair Kappa
[2022-12-28 03:16:36] <BatrachosHS> trillion damage would be better
[2022-12-28 03:16:59] <+Hammondista> What i don¬¥t understand is why they don¬¥t bring back some control warrior deck
[2022-12-28 03:17:09] <+AnduinCubed> honestly, rotate renethal and bring back elyssiana

[2022-12-28 03:18:38] <galeru> renathal should do my taxes for me when I play him in my deck
[2022-12-28 03:18:46] <%+Xeath5> i think only now would 3 mana from the depths be insane

[2022-12-28 03:24:15] <GronminHots> @photon_hs basically it's meant to counter burn decks but not tempo decks, so you just give them armor if their opponent doesn't have stuff on board cause a tempo deck would have stuff on board. While spreading plague is a tempo/aggro counter

[2022-12-28 04:00:05] <Aptesun> you know from what i have been seeing the renathal nerf did not go far enough, he should only let you have 40 cards in deck at most, maybe even set max life to 25
[2022-12-28 04:00:24] <+Sebinot> only counter is the same deck and making the mistake of not going first

[2022-12-28 04:00:26] <+TuffHunterTactics> Is there a reason we use a 2/2 over 3/4 (guild trader).  Less health for our opponent to brand and kill us?

[2022-12-28 04:20:54] <+bumpiesttitan07> @tookies3 Well, that‚Äôs very trippy.
[2022-12-28 04:20:55] <%+xcesme> It seemed to me all the non renathal decks were designed around the fact most people had 40hp
[2022-12-28 04:21:09] <mnqz> @nohandsgamer so r u with or against renathal 40 hp
[2022-12-28 04:21:10] <Jimmy_Page_> nh now that its a aggro meta, dont you think 4 mana theotar should come back?
[2022-12-28 04:21:11] <WesleyWyndamPrice> @tworefine This guy can count cards so fast...it's unreal! Kappa
[2022-12-28 04:21:25] <+bumpiesttitan07> @tookies3 Chirpy my bad chirpy.
[2022-12-28 04:21:48] <%+GuildChatter> 42 is the answer

[2022-12-28 04:22:14] <Jimmy_Page_> that was all over the place
[2022-12-28 04:22:18] <f3000xen> make renethal give 8000 health like in yugioh
[2022-12-28 04:22:29] <DerPeetz> just 420 life and 420 cards in deck. Kappa
[2022-12-28 04:22:37] <tictac_hs> Think yes
[2022-12-28 04:22:42] <%+ucdchris1> renathal should give one more health for each card you add past 40 until you hit 40 hp max so 45 cards
[2022-12-28 04:22:43] <GronminHots> 50/50
[2022-12-28 04:22:51] <mnqz> @nohandsgamer I missed aggro meta
[2022-12-28 04:22:54] <+Eudyptes151> @DerPeetz I think you mean 420 life and 69 cards

[2022-12-28 04:22:59] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> no minions only removal and armor gain
[2022-12-28 04:23:09] <%+xcesme> Renathal should give 20 HP but you can only take 1 damage at a time. Like the duels treasure. Thoughts?
[2022-12-28 04:23:09] <+Sebinot> I just looked through possible cards instead of jace. What do you think of wratscale naga? "After a friendly minion dies, deal 3 dmg to a random enemy"

[2022-12-28 04:23:25] <%torrenaxe> Renathal should give 32 HP and 50 cards
[2022-12-28 04:23:26] <DerPeetz> @Eudyptes151 nice thought but please stay realistic! Kappa
[2022-12-28 04:23:33] <%+GuildChatter> He'll help summon your minions early with that 1 mana card

[2022-12-28 05:02:31] <tictac_hs> Priest is the clear problem in this meta, it's winrate is still too high at 41.6%
[2022-12-28 05:02:51] <+Sj315> Too high
[2022-12-28 05:02:58] <thegame___na> next nerf will 100% include radian, 3/2 naga that draws, and the 1 mana naga is going to 3 mana. thatll fix the meta
[2022-12-28 05:03:11] <%+Xeath5> yo i saw a control warrior on ladder from the depths needs to be at 6 mana Madge it stop other decks from enjoying the meta or something Madge
[2022-12-28 05:03:19] <tictac_hs> Think it would be hilarious if they nerfed radiant KEKL
[2022-12-28 05:03:29] <%davesillygoose> Nohand is right, game should be short so that people can play multiples games when they take a poop. People like to poop no play game when they go to work. They are happy, and willing to spend money.
[2022-12-28 05:03:35] <thegame___na> i have to send blizzard a replay. i was in a game that went 8 turns. more nerfs
[2022-12-28 05:03:44] <%+GuildChatter> omg... Blizzard nerfed Priest so DH wouldn't face minion wall on turn 5.
[2022-12-28 05:03:57] <aendlessssssly> 41,6% and a nice skin you can buy? thats just unacceptable. BLIZZARD? NERFS! MODS

[2022-12-28 05:05:14] <+StuffedVulture> remove 1 health from Stheno since she is OP
[2022-12-28 05:05:14] <%+Xeath5> they will probably lower the hp to 25 cuz nohands played to turn 8 ICANT

[2022-12-28 05:06:41] <@%littleballofhate> @tictac_hs By contrast, I argue that the most skill testing decks would actually not be readily picked up by simple statistical aggregation, because they may only be successfully played by 1-2 people at high legend, because they are so specific and difficult to play even at that skill level
[2022-12-28 05:06:53] <@%littleballofhate> @tictac_hs And the example I point to when making this argument is your priest play
[2022-12-28 05:07:13] <aendlessssssly> poor Norwis leaving patch with his quest DH only, hitting tripple #1, then blizzard makes lady steno 3 mana 2/3

[2022-12-28 05:11:14] <+SuddenHuevos> most its legendaries are free

[2022-12-28 05:11:50] <%+ScrapStation> its a rogue right

[2022-12-28 06:46:17] <brockmalkmus> mana is an outdated concept, why can't everyone just play their cards whenever they want?
[2022-12-28 06:46:25] <%snaktray> whole deck costing 0 will probably result in a win reduction at lower ranks

[2022-12-28 22:38:50] <SpykoNukov> how useful is the quest tbh ? is the occasionnal help with discount worth the shittier mulligan ?

[2022-12-28 22:39:01] <Fennicks47> ?
[2022-12-28 22:39:07] <Fennicks47> you mean + 7 mana?

[2022-12-28 22:39:46] <%rexmkh> @SpykoNukov you run it for the hand discounts not the reward
[2022-12-28 22:40:05] <Fennicks47> yeah he never uses the reward
[2022-12-28 22:40:14] <SpykoNukov> oh yeah I know you don't care about the reward. was just genuinely wondering how worth the discounts are
[2022-12-28 22:40:33] <wokkelsenpaii> yo nohands, made legend 2nd month back with this deck today, thx
[2022-12-28 22:40:35] <Fennicks47> yeah its pretty gross most of the time, eck has so much card draw the -1 card is fine
[2022-12-28 22:40:47] <%rexmkh> it enables big damage with lady if you discount a lot of 1-2 mana cards
[2022-12-28 22:40:59] <Fennicks47> bound souls being free is hilarious as well
[2022-12-28 22:41:21] <SpykoNukov> tbh it's hard to discuss while he keep getting nut hand like there, double sinful. Guess I'm really just unlucky

[2022-12-28 22:41:36] <Fennicks47> tbh this is really bad hand
[2022-12-28 22:41:38] <5ftHax> got him to the magic number

[2022-12-28 22:41:54] <Fennicks47> yeah this game it worked out amazing
[2022-12-28 22:42:05] <5ftHax> against boon priest this is the hand you want
[2022-12-28 22:42:09] <SpykoNukov> double sinfull + warband is 20dmg
[2022-12-28 22:42:12] <Fennicks47> but usually losses are when he draws too much sinful not enough card draw
[2022-12-28 22:42:12] <5ftHax> ironically enough
[2022-12-28 22:42:13] <SpykoNukov> defuq you mean bad ?

[2022-12-28 22:42:30] <+JoNnyMaC70> It's almost as if the opponent can see your hand. Kappa
[2022-12-28 22:42:33] <Fennicks47> i mean, usualy he drew 10 extra cards and hit this as well
[2022-12-28 22:42:57] <Fennicks47> aalll the way in last week
[2022-12-28 22:43:19] <+helix_sky> bam bam thx you maam

[2022-12-28 22:43:52] <Apock13> so the idea is to not play 20/20 on turn 6.
[2022-12-28 22:44:09] <jpch> yeah he killed a turn late, bad hand
[2022-12-28 22:44:12] <meteospasmyl> they should have played around it
[2022-12-28 22:44:13] <Fennicks47> :(
[2022-12-28 22:44:20] <Fennicks47> win on turn 7, losing consistency i see
[2022-12-28 22:44:41] <%rexmkh> the opponent had 2 choices at turn 6: pop up or concede. in both cases, they were going to lose. they just had to choose the method
[2022-12-28 22:44:53] <%rexmkh> pop off*

[2022-12-28 22:46:45] <SpykoNukov> tbh I'd really like to see vs a deck like pure pally, implock or maybe evolve shaman. From my experience of a dumpster legend player this deck can't do shit vs strong board (beside double sinful ofc)
