[2022-12-26 00:35:00] <@%Grimstab77> That's not true Nali'. Good players can be OTP
[2022-12-26 00:35:01] <%Xx_Queenie_Xx> @jubinoms excuse me?
[2022-12-26 00:35:09] <%Ryunnare> but you are a one trick pony mercy Nali

[2022-12-26 00:35:24] <GorixPL> Brigitte was OP
[2022-12-26 00:35:25] <plasterbate> ZBRA wants to talk you
[2022-12-26 00:35:27] <ShadowCatGambit> Overhog
[2022-12-26 00:35:39] <@%Grimstab77> Zen was super OP! Oh wait no, that never happened Kappa
[2022-12-26 00:35:40] <GorixPL> and I miss that OP Brigitte
[2022-12-26 00:36:14] <ShadowCatGambit> @GorixPL I agree, at least bring back the shield stun and 500 hp shield
[2022-12-26 00:36:25] <%+pyromana192> Op brigitte is torture to play against
[2022-12-26 00:36:35] <plasterbate> free stuns
[2022-12-26 00:36:37] <@%Grimstab77> Give brig wallclimb. Will fix her 100%

[2022-12-26 00:37:02] <serenn____> good Brig' players are annoying
[2022-12-26 00:37:03] <plasterbate> Brig is one meta away from being the main healer
[2022-12-26 00:37:21] <plasterbate> if queen was ever meta again brig would be too
[2022-12-26 00:37:31] <ShadowCatGambit> It's really hard to play Brigette now, especially because there is only one tank now.
[2022-12-26 00:38:01] <@%Grimstab77> LUL this pharah broke a sweat
[2022-12-26 00:38:13] <+LordofLoony> I feel like brig should be the only one witha stun, it makes sense since it's a shield bash
[2022-12-26 00:38:24] <%sethya123> Have a good night everyone 2020Party

[2022-12-26 00:38:51] <ShadowCatGambit> @LordofLoony yeah, it's okay to pull some stuns from the game, but Bridgette in particular needs it

[2022-12-26 00:39:30] <ZataraSWE> her shield bash could also be used for turning of someone's ult for a while
[2022-12-26 00:39:44] <+itsuwuzi> bbjessHey bbjessHey
