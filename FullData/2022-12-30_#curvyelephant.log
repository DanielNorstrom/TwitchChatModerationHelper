[2022-12-30 13:42:52] <grandbeanz> What if he has a legal weapon, gets searched and then has a bunch of oxy?
[2022-12-30 13:43:43] <+Loremipsum21> Frisks shouldn't escalate to full searches over legal weapons
[2022-12-30 13:43:59] <@%nmussa> Yeah but you still need to check, kind of like K9 sniffs for a legal amount of joints
[2022-12-30 13:44:03] <+Loremipsum21> they are basically just to identify dangerous objects @grandbeanz
[2022-12-30 13:44:06] <grandbeanz> All the frisk results in is a bulge or not
[2022-12-30 13:44:16] <grandbeanz> hm okay
[2022-12-30 13:44:19] <@%nmussa> Idk, I think most of officers would ignore the illegal shit
[2022-12-30 13:44:26] <@%nmussa> But legally they might be clear for an arrest

[2022-12-30 15:13:21] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.

[2022-12-30 16:24:51] <%aurvinR> So apparently you can hide people's nicknames via "Interface -> "Show Names Above Healthbar" -> "Champion Name", but I'm not 100% sure how to do it globally; might have to tinker with the settings in Interface for that, or sth different.
