[2022-12-10 06:55:35] <cherrimode> very happy to relax right now
[2022-12-10 06:55:58] <%+may_shell> i like the appeal of hybrid classes in school now
[2022-12-10 06:56:27] <cherrimode> i spent most of my school years sleeping in class. i love and hate the laziness of online college
[2022-12-10 06:56:39] <%+may_shell> I get to go back in 2 years. graduate school is expensive so here i am trying to MAKE money lmao

[2022-12-10 08:21:53] <TechyOracle> Like, the bottom wisdom teeth were completely horizontal, which mean they were submerged a bit in the jaw bone.
[2022-12-10 08:22:46] <OriginalHamsta> Unfortunately, with my GERD it was inevitable.  What was surprising was that I went in because a different crowned tooth was getting pings.  I didn't know how bad it was until they showed me the panoramic x-ray. ... When -I- could tell there was a problem, it's a problem.
[2022-12-10 08:22:53] <arely_v1ll> I was a silver tooth kid. Can’t remember how much I had, maybe 9???
