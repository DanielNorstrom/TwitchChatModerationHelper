[2022-12-15 17:50:10] <%+remiri> glintblade plus the thrust should be like 50 poise damage even with a daggar

[2022-12-15 17:50:29] <%$Baryon23> yeah after Godrick is dead, Rogier's rapier is a great option
[2022-12-15 17:50:32] <%$Mellon_> just grab reduvia, can still use the weapon art without having the required levels NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:51:09] <%hollownewb> Antspur rapier is good, does rot and can be buffed. Morningstar is OP for poise breaks and bleed
[2022-12-15 17:51:15] <%dennybur> @Mellon_ i don't think you can use WA without levels

[2022-12-15 18:47:13] <KatAttackk> Day 1 elden ring was wierd lol. The gatekeeping was atrocious LUL
[2022-12-15 18:47:31] <Fileton_Fromton> fourt months after its release, elden ring had the same amount of google search than did god of war at its peak
[2022-12-15 18:47:33] <DreampopCalli> @old_sound he was just the hero the community needed at the time.
[2022-12-15 18:47:38] <KatAttackk> I remember early elden ring everyone hated on magic builds for being too "easy"
[2022-12-15 18:47:52] <%Zormi> Elden ring success 1) open world , people love that it works atm, 2) its one of the rare game that came out finished this year wich bumps its value by a lot

[2022-12-15 18:55:58] <SlaveKnightG> it makes sense to see so many crucible knights or night's cavalry or whatever, they exist for a reason and it would be lame if we only fought 1 of them

[2022-12-15 18:58:43] <%Zormi> @dinossindgeil When you're done with elden chad challenge maybe instead when your run dies you can run a casual playthrough of hollow knight at the end of your streams dinossHK
