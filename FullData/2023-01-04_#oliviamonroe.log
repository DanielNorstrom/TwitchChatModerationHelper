[2023-01-04 18:05:30] <%Sleeper_can> Tower Defense means enemies come through a road and you have to build towers and defenses to shoot them down.
[2023-01-04 18:05:30] <%Furudehan> Tower defense is a genre.
[2023-01-04 18:05:38] <@%Athagorn> it's just how the genre came to be known.
[2023-01-04 18:05:38] <%merchantilist> Tower Defense is a game strategy where the enemy follows a path, and you have to stop the enemy from reaching the goal.

[2023-01-04 18:57:33] <ANewOne71> I just want to take some time to remind the audiance: When this game first launched, 100 rings didn't give you an extra life, and you started with 5 lives.
[2023-01-04 18:57:38] <%TalkingObject> Did you at least hit the other person?
[2023-01-04 18:57:43] <%Sotetsu> That's why the table is bolted down
[2023-01-04 18:57:44] <ANewOne71> @abysshunted Agreed: But this is still a specially awful level.

[2023-01-04 19:01:11] <ANewOne71> @OliviaMonroe You can hold left to slow down a bit, you just need to time your jumps VERY precisely.
[2023-01-04 19:01:12] <@%$BlackCharcz> WiiU? Based Oli
[2023-01-04 19:01:15] <%Hentaiwatcher_> take the hit on the 4carts and just jump the bomb
[2023-01-04 19:01:20] <ANewOne71> And you need to double jump over them very precisely.
[2023-01-04 19:01:24] <%Rarefoil> double jump?
[2023-01-04 19:01:26] <%+PedroYuuhi> Wii U was the perfect console to play pikmin and no one can change my opinion

[2023-01-04 19:09:52] <ANewOne71> Okay: So people call the modern or post generations part of sonic "The meta era" I don't see it at all for this game: I Think this game just has bad writing
[2023-01-04 19:10:03] <Appleman6> SONIC IS PLAYING SONIC LOST WORLD WINTHIN OLIVIA PLAYING SONIC LOST WORLD
[2023-01-04 19:10:04] <frankenatorgaming> sonic 06 is still bad

[2023-01-04 19:11:04] <%+hashtag420yoloswaqmonster> is the new sonic part of the meta era?
[2023-01-04 19:11:12] <Daverost> @ANewOne71 It's called that because the writing is meta and very fourth wall breaking (and hokey and slapstick) and that's why no one likes it.

[2023-01-04 19:11:24] <cuppachae> LUL
[2023-01-04 19:11:25] <ANewOne71> @Daverost This game is just REALLY badly written
[2023-01-04 19:11:25] <%TalkingObject> The controls arren't that complex
[2023-01-04 19:11:26] <%Megaket> I started Yakuza 0 on hard because I figured I'm a hardened veteran. That was three years ago, and the scars it left me with have yet to heal
[2023-01-04 19:11:29] <%+PedroYuuhi> Def recommend Yakuza 0 to your gf
[2023-01-04 19:11:36] <%JayBusch> No, Yakuza is a good test on if we can get married. If she doesn‚Äôt beat if, we‚Äôre not a good fit.
[2023-01-04 19:11:37] <%P1ZZAC4T> Zero is very good
[2023-01-04 19:11:38] <%Sotetsu> Jump King only uses one button
[2023-01-04 19:11:39] <Obsidian_Dragoon> So don't recommend her Bayonetta either. Because that's more than a little unforgiving as well
[2023-01-04 19:11:42] <!%AirahsELL> is that what happened to ex husband number 3
[2023-01-04 19:11:42] <%PigWithoutProtection> there wad a youtuber who made his gf play Dark Souls as her first game, then recorded it. fun videos.
[2023-01-04 19:11:43] <NagasakiMH> a very good game with horrible controls? Monster hunter Tri for Wii
[2023-01-04 19:11:44] <ANewOne71> @Daverost Sonic has maybe 1 line that lampshades a 4th wall break, but very little else
[2023-01-04 19:11:52] <ANewOne71> Again: This game is just kind of badly written
[2023-01-04 19:11:57] <chromasnare> true, not a for a first game
[2023-01-04 19:11:57] <%oddgoblinz> give her sonic erosNote
[2023-01-04 19:11:57] <frankenatorgaming> are ya getting the new kirby game next month? @OliviaMonroe

[2023-01-04 19:12:01] <%GinTamashiVT> So, Banjo?
[2023-01-04 19:12:02] <badassm1ner> like Sonic Forces
[2023-01-04 19:12:02] <ANewOne71> @NagasakiMH Not hrorible, but Kid Icarus Uprising
[2023-01-04 19:12:02] <%Yokeshi_DS> something easier like the original crash bandicoot for the ps1, with limited save points, and unforgiving platform sections
[2023-01-04 19:12:02] <@%Athagorn> But if you really want to overwhelm your loved one recommend XC2 msclOmegalul
[2023-01-04 19:12:03] <theonetruetodd> I'll choose a co-op game if I had a girlfriend
[2023-01-04 19:12:03] <%StuckBoy> sounds like most nintendo platformers
[2023-01-04 19:12:04] <modplsnobannerino> yakuza 3 however is a really bad yakuza game for me KEKW

[2023-01-04 19:12:23] <%$MaxDOutEX> Is there a better answer than Kirby Epic Yarn?
[2023-01-04 19:12:28] <Atroc1ty_rj> id probably recommend Uncharted 3

[2023-01-04 19:31:17] <%+RedPixel22> Honestly, a mistake like this is actually impressive because you managed to get to the final world without using a core mechanic
[2023-01-04 19:31:18] <ANewOne71> @OliviaMonroe Did you know you can charge the homing attack?
[2023-01-04 19:31:19] <$IsaMorphic> why is aged up jimmy neutron insulting us while we escalate
[2023-01-04 19:31:22] <@%owlishnick> Why does Sonic have a run button
[2023-01-04 19:31:26] <$YuzuAdagioCh> why is there a run button anyway?  it's sonic, when do you not wanna run
[2023-01-04 19:31:32] <badassm1ner> this game fails to teach it's core mechanics

[2023-01-04 21:29:41] <!%GoodishGames> wish Banjo had more movement options, as Talon Trot does make the game basically just oving from challenge to challenge, which isn't fun
[2023-01-04 21:29:41] <%JayBusch> I don‚Äôt remember the last one but there‚Äôs a third movie mixed in here.

[2023-01-04 21:43:26] <%Con4you> NotLikeThis
[2023-01-04 21:43:31] <%BlackConvoy> Instant rice is only viable when you're lazy and you have a good protein to mask the flavor. That being said, always have so Furikake seasoning around.
[2023-01-04 21:43:32] <@%DrGoodStrats> YOU EAT TOILET PAPER LUL
