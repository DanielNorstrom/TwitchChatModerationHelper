[2022-12-08 17:36:14] <%brianthebroken85> @Radolov I apologize in my advance since a spamming caster was the only character I had available. My other character is pure PVE...
[2022-12-08 17:36:16] <GeneraIRadhan> that's what she said

[2022-12-08 17:37:07] <%DeadBart> like I imagine it'd be like team wipe = a point VS just killing someone = a point
[2022-12-08 17:37:13] <paraclitus_666> I think your mistake is that you continue running and hitting the enemy with ordinary way, you need to make some renewing in your attacking movements.
[2022-12-08 17:37:15] <shootermcgavinbaybay> lol
[2022-12-08 17:37:16] <%brianthebroken85> My other character is higher level, but I had respecced him to only do Golden Wave, haha.
