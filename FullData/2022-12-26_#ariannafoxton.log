[2022-12-26 21:03:59] <contebaracca> It's specifically designed for HEAT but the mechanism is very specific to RP{G-7 IRL
[2022-12-26 21:04:07] <%SetPhaserstoPun> yaya
[2022-12-26 21:04:10] <contebaracca> It's basically like a piece of wood for regular HEAT rounds
[2022-12-26 21:04:14] <%sharkslayxii> given how overpressure in this game works, probably very poorly

[2022-12-26 21:04:51] <%LossyInput> that's HESH, not HEAT, no?

[2022-12-26 21:05:51] <contebaracca> Again slat armor is specifically designed to crush the front cone of the RPG-7 which shorts out the fuze on RPG-7  It is really only effective against RPG-7 IRL

[2022-12-26 21:37:15] <+ShilohJackVT> Canadian and European "suburbs" are self-sufficient with systems of public transport and areas of leisure and proliferation. US suburbs are organized solely on ONE thing - "FREEDOM." That's why US suburban houses are so spaced apart with tracts of land, picket fences, and other hyperindividualistic property features. Public transport in the US is thus impossible due to rugged individualism.

[2022-12-26 23:36:11] <Sarcastically_Logical> @TioTrix Its not a bad game, but it will take some time to learn if you do play it. Less actually needing to shoot people directly and more just knowing general game knowledge.
[2022-12-26 23:36:52] <%SetPhaserstoPun> knowing which people to shoot takes some time
[2022-12-26 23:36:59] <Sarcastically_Logical> @TioTrix Another game I personally enjoy alot of Hell Let Loose (HLL for sure) which is a WW2 game similar-ish to squad.

[2022-12-26 23:44:30] <Sarcastically_Logical> @TioTrix So was AFK, yes you can level. Certain classes have hard lockouts for gear. Or most severs restrict commander behind a general level (since its such an important role overall). Doesn't matter too much about class level though, only 3 really need it. Crewmen for a blowtorch, rifleman for smoke nades, and support so you can resupply people with rockets.
[2022-12-26 23:45:06] <%Kiav> @Sarcastically_Logical illegal, support is only for garrisons you animal!

[2022-12-26 23:54:28] <Sarcastically_Logical> @D4RKEVA0204 If not. Think of a lot slower Battlefield 2/3. To the point people are actually making a BF3 mod that is very simular to this game.

[2022-12-26 23:57:54] <Sarcastically_Logical> Squad camos are quite close to each other usually from what I've seen. Which does make sense seeing how you aren't throwing people into the forest in desert camo
