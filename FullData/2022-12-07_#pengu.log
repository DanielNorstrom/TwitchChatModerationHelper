You'd think it's a unique character but Winter Soldier ingame uses the captain america skeleton (he can lift Mjolnir) and is a mix of Cap and Black Widow
[2022-12-07 13:00:56] <!%realjimmyjams> is this a passion stack

[2022-12-07 13:01:09] <%Corvus_TheCrow> What's the opposite of a death stack?
[2022-12-07 13:01:11] <gr1efe> is that why my KD is only 1.8 in bronze
[2022-12-07 13:01:13] <Athix01> any thoughts on the rank system so far? is it better than before?
[2022-12-07 13:01:15] <+Malice_H> just feels so weird that rank doesn't actually matter
[2022-12-07 13:01:16] <+Miller599> Yeah but once i reach silber in ranked 2.0 who will i play against? Still champs or new silver ? I donâ€™t understand man
[2022-12-07 13:01:22] <+Spiderpig3403> What you are describing sounds like skill based matchmaking. Is r6 ranked 2.0 the same as that ?
[2022-12-07 13:01:34] <Leipegamer> You should get more ranking points per win than a lower mmr rated player gets then. Otherwise it takes you much longer to get to gold for instance
[2022-12-07 13:01:36] <%Corvus_TheCrow> Chat the big difference is hidden MMR/Elo.
[2022-12-07 13:01:47] <%Corvus_TheCrow> So now you can't prove what rank you really are
[2022-12-07 13:01:50] <@%itsTiica> depending on how long you play I might be able to join after work if you still need a 5th
[2022-12-07 13:01:53] <+Hxncey> If more people hit a higher rank think theyâ€™ll do a small change next season? Eg average rank is gold 2 and it goes up to plat 2 or somehing
[2022-12-07 13:01:57] <+Miller599> But what defines the skill in siege??
[2022-12-07 13:02:00] <%Corvus_TheCrow> SBMM in Dead By Daylight too
[2022-12-07 13:02:12] <%Corvus_TheCrow> Yeah I think it's win/loss
[2022-12-07 13:02:36] <Leipegamer> I hope they look at kost
[2022-12-07 13:02:43] <%Corvus_TheCrow> In csgo and valorant it's based on MVP stars, win/loss, round diff, k/d/a

[2022-12-07 13:03:10] <R0ARIX> Its why csgo is still and will always be the goat

[2022-12-07 13:03:49] <+Miller599> I think its pretty bad that siege is not explaining how the new matchmaking works

[2022-12-07 13:05:23] <%Corvus_TheCrow> It alleviates ALL of the pressure
[2022-12-07 13:05:30] <+Miller599> But if u go for 0 kills but 3 wins by ur own by plantingâ€¦. Another one is 1vs5 sitting outside getting 3 exitfragsâ€¦ tbh the guy with 0 kills have a better performance
[2022-12-07 13:05:35] <%Corvus_TheCrow> But also, I'd love to fucking know if i'm facing a diamond or champion
[2022-12-07 13:05:48] <+Miller599> @corvus_thecrow true
[2022-12-07 13:06:00] <%Corvus_TheCrow> Cause OCE unranked is DEAD

[2022-12-07 14:06:43] <%BattleAxeBBQ> @pengu do you think crossplay is going to be good? Controller aim assist will need a buff.
[2022-12-07 14:06:44] <NameNotImprtant> Would this be a disadvantage for us PC players since console players will have Aim assist? NotLikeThis

[2022-12-07 14:07:38] <Bowling_dude> personally, I feel like the new ranked system is good for moral of players. the fact that losing a game 4-5 then following up with a win means forward movement is great
[2022-12-07 14:07:41] <cheffkamau> i dont rlly like the speed changes to the ops, its like ubi dont know how the operators should be played

[2022-12-07 14:10:38] <Beulena> @srlcsv should play unranked, essentially casual but with better maps/gameplay

[2022-12-07 14:10:52] <M45terPr0> Did everyone get a load of esports packs in the new season? For some reason I had 141 when I had 0 the day before

[2022-12-07 14:10:57] <NameNotImprtant> It's good since we can't ban the new map , like old siege somewhat

[2022-12-07 14:11:43] <Beulena> what about a preference system, so ban a few maps and like/dislike others
[2022-12-07 14:11:47] <+Amontix> what up pengu do u know how they will handle the ranked points in this season
[2022-12-07 14:11:53] <srlcsv> Beulena true but i like maps like fortress and hereford, it just sucks im forced to load in a lobby and see i get a map 3 times in a row
[2022-12-07 14:12:05] <The_Underachiver> that way emerald plain and skyscraper will never have their q finished to have a game

[2022-12-07 14:12:18] <@%itsTiica> I think changing the current map ban system so that every team can ban 2 maps (after each other and not at the same time) would be great at least to try out
[2022-12-07 14:12:35] <winstrxl_> it was over 300

[2022-12-07 14:39:51] <gauss932> @Pengu Is it perhaps to discourage the "cod" platstyle?
[2022-12-07 14:39:53] <Wisekik> I still think they did it because they want him to be moved more into a support role (because of the frags and the soft breach potential, like zofia with the stuns) instead of a 2nd entry operator

[2022-12-07 14:57:27] <+JonTonR6> anyone else having problems with R6 crashing the PC? have been having the issue ever since the update
[2022-12-07 14:57:34] <+CrustyyPickle> reallyyy hard and annoying on normal difficulty so i had to lower to the base difficulty + an option in accessibility that if u die to a boss it lets u respawn with the boss at 50% health so those helped
[2022-12-07 14:57:56] <+CrustyyPickle> tho this accessibility option isnt availaible for '' give me god of war'' difficulty

[2022-12-07 15:13:10] <+TBar0n> @iPatyoo the rank you see has nothing to do with matchmaking. Basically you have hidden mmr (based on winrate i think) which does the matchmaking. So you can be diamond but play in "silver mmr". I hope its understandable :D
