[2022-12-29 19:06:56] <%Quancy> i think human damage is such a big issue with why everything does too much damage now a days

[2022-12-29 19:07:22] <@%Sh0ckie> idk about that, not pvping often xD
[2022-12-29 19:07:37] <%Quancy> and on top of that, instead of blaming human damage, people blame the classes
[2022-12-29 19:07:37] <@%Sh0ckie> gotta try that out once the setup is there
[2022-12-29 19:07:43] <%Quancy> which sometimes the class is the issue
[2022-12-29 19:07:46] <%+Whiteangelsx> im good right now im do dungeons
[2022-12-29 19:07:51] <%Quancy> but a lot of the time it is also the human damage
[2022-12-29 19:08:08] <@%Sh0ckie> Quancy youre making me curious xD
[2022-12-29 19:08:34] <%Quancy> human damage is technically 0.8 AP

[2022-12-29 19:08:45] <%+Whiteangelsx> ya but we have problem with 3rd dung in elvia server
[2022-12-29 19:08:52] <%Quancy> so if you stack 100 human damage
[2022-12-29 19:08:54] <%Quancy> you looking at like
[2022-12-29 19:08:58] <%Quancy> 4 AP brackets
[2022-12-29 19:09:12] VIEWERS: 49
[2022-12-29 19:09:20] <@%Sh0ckie> hmmm
[2022-12-29 19:09:51] <%Quancy> plus the main people who stack human damage is DR people. stacking that human damage with accuracy accessories kind of makes the AP loss from the accuracy accessories poontless
[2022-12-29 19:09:56] <%+Whiteangelsx> mmmm we have problem with deer
[2022-12-29 19:09:59] <%Quancy> in other words
[2022-12-29 19:10:04] <%Quancy> human damage is a huge issue
[2022-12-29 19:10:06] <%+Whiteangelsx> we do good mechanic but alaways wipe when they spawn towers
[2022-12-29 19:10:12] <@%Sh0ckie> oh rip i am evasion haha
[2022-12-29 19:10:27] <%+Whiteangelsx> but in normal alaways works
[2022-12-29 19:10:27] <%Quancy> it is pointless to stack human damage as evasion
[2022-12-29 19:10:29] <%+Whiteangelsx> xD
[2022-12-29 19:10:31] <@%Sh0ckie> okay
[2022-12-29 19:10:51] <%Quancy> if you going to go evasion, grab anything to make you tanky
[2022-12-29 19:11:13] VIEWERS: 49
[2022-12-29 19:11:48] <%Quancy> keep in mind human damage also makes players squishier, in NA people rather run RBF Cobe over Special Evasions, making em even squishier to me running 275 AP and 420 DP
[2022-12-29 19:12:57] <%Quancy> then again, i feel like Special Evasion crystals scale better when you're evasion
[2022-12-29 19:13:01] <%+Whiteangelsx> anyway Kuugel did u drop part from padix ?
[2022-12-29 19:13:02] <%Quancy> as DR, it feels like you die no matter what
