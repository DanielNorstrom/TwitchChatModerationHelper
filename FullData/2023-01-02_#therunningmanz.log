I also wonder if it might be the quality of the connections people are on?

[2023-01-02 13:37:34] <+bobbydz85> I think Dayz is eternally re-playable just through the sheer amount of community content alone.

[2023-01-02 13:38:49] <%eelskillz> @FEHR0 Tarkov is made with Unity, no way it could handle such a massive map. But DayZ fully migrated to the Enfusion engine, that is my dream.

[2023-01-02 13:44:11] <+corle0n> just tuned in but didnt they do exactly that with the 12 hour drop windows per streamer?
[2023-01-02 13:44:15] <%eelskillz> @Feast_130 sure. Also, Bohemia had their try with Unreal Engine, but ended up creating Enfusion. I'm guessing, it's becuase it would be more work to create DayZ kind of open world in UE than creating their own engine designed with that in mind.

[2023-01-02 13:44:24] <%+toppa35> or just say that any Tarky streamer  has drops enabled during X period
[2023-01-02 13:44:24] <@%MrMcGravyBaby> or let people apply for it, no matter the size of stream?

[2023-01-02 13:44:51] <minomess> drops promote a streamer not a game cause you need to already have it in order to gain the drops. the whole drops system needs a revamp
[2023-01-02 13:44:55] <%Viking_Saint> Isn't that just Twitch in general? I am sure some say that about when you are live

[2023-01-02 14:06:47] <war_junkie2509> Most of those community servers are mouse and keyboard which is shit. Why play mouse and keyboard on console. Just play pc

[2023-01-02 14:17:59] <irnmiketyson> if they can buy a good center forward they will make it top 4, man u will

[2023-01-02 14:18:24] <%BarbaricPrawn> I think Forest and Bournemouth will go down. Then I think Southampton.

[2023-01-02 14:19:25] <%mannybrown1> U could say newcastle may struggle to keep up their good form over the course of the season though they are playing fantastic
[2023-01-02 14:19:30] <TheBronzeSeries> The injuries are the worst, our bench is extremely poor compared to other clubs.
[2023-01-02 14:19:31] <%+gringo_smoker> i think arsenal could do it this year too if not its gonna be embarrassing
[2023-01-02 14:19:32] <%+ScarTKO> isnt Mount moving to Liverpool?

[2023-01-02 16:26:38] <%TomEmilioDavies> You could probably fire 308 out of a Mosin.

[2023-01-02 16:56:45] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-02 18:42:00] <+SirJimiee> @cruciphyxiate not really it's FACT, the latest COD game is the fastest selling COD game ever, proving it's hardly 'falling off' and proves it's still ridiculously popular
[2023-01-02 18:42:01] <%+Thewhiskeyjack> @redline_si  Carpet tunnels aren't bad, they can be fun. They hide behind a pair of meat curtains and before you enter you have to flick the bean shaped switch a whole bunch before everything works
[2023-01-02 18:42:02] <%sleepysteve69> I think this is the second life and the second time you‚Äôve thrown out carpet tunnel!

[2023-01-02 19:03:20] <CitrusFly> I agree with that sentiment. I just got off playing a few hours, I got a cold, got down to red-flashing, and worked to try and get well again. When the illness it was so much better. Although I am like a 10-hour player so learning these things are important for a beginner.

[2023-01-02 19:48:31] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-02 19:55:47] <%Helo0931> @sleepysteve69 That happens in lower municipal courts all the time. It's a huge civil liberties issue called Asset Forfeiture. Basically they can take your stuff if they think (not proven) you've committed a crime. There have been instances that the accusal is the mere act of having a lot of cash.

[2023-01-02 21:02:43] <%Marioenfissi> It‚Äôs surprising how important zeds are for the game. Just as stamina is as well. Infinite stamina is horrible when I‚Äôve played with it.

[2023-01-02 21:04:35] <%+TokkenringAltx> The zeds back in the mod would only walk indoors

[2023-01-02 21:04:38] <%Helo0931> @LawyerMD I know there is at least a Cherno winter (nemalsk survival) and Livonia
[2023-01-02 21:04:47] <chefi__> Do you get annoyed at all by cheaters or have you come to terms with them after such a long time playing the game?

[2023-01-02 21:39:33] <%ImMrRectangle> I miss those 'regular' customers you get from retail and the mental 'punch out' but other than that retail is draining

[2023-01-02 22:09:55] <ladyskyy88> I know some Dalmatian breeders. They are hyper vigilant about socializing the pups in the 8 weeks. They keep the pups in their house and they keep the mom with them. We still got a Dal that's like nuts haha.

[2023-01-02 22:10:04] <%LawyerMD> The general rule here in Norway is to go through the official kennel club, they're the ones who give the stamp of approval on breeders. Yet some people basically use the craigslist equivalent...
[2023-01-02 22:10:05] <Axelbuddy> my puppy was flown from Serbia to the US at 8 weeks. she was a little traumatized, but was good after a few weeks.

[2023-01-02 22:58:18] <ulooktired> coffee is a major laxative
[2023-01-02 22:58:20] <%+DNBassist> Does it always do it to you? I can't have coffee in the morning for the same reasons, but when it gets into the afternoon it's alright
[2023-01-02 22:58:22] <Swibo> Coffee sends a signal to your stomach to release gastrin. This kicks off a wave of contractions in your gut called peristalsis. Peristalsis moves food and liquid through the intestines. For some people, this leads to a trip to the bathroom in just a few minutes.

[2023-01-02 23:57:31] <%TomEmilioDavies> I think most of us would watch you just respawning for 12 hours and talking to chat.
[2023-01-02 23:57:33] <+galadhrim1982> Hi @therunningmanz ! Best wishes to everyone <3 I say after so long it's time to let the dark ryu in you express itself ^^
[2023-01-02 23:57:39] <scumm7> Dollar bet. He gets the spawn and i immedieately murdered.

[2023-01-02 23:57:50] <toxiccckitten> hey trmz hows the stream going?\
[2023-01-02 23:57:55] <SpriteQc> typical "glass half full" brit mentality. You should instead say "There's nothing else I can achieve in 19 minutes, might as well commit to this till the end"
[2023-01-02 23:57:55] <%hellbubb> now now now
[2023-01-02 23:57:56] <nate_has888> this will be the right spawn
[2023-01-02 23:57:58] <streetbred87o6> magic spawn

[2023-01-02 23:57:59] <$deadfethr> A year ago, watching TRMZ swim during the first Namalsk swim spawn, I would have agreed with that
[2023-01-02 23:58:00] <scumm7> er is immediately

[2023-01-02 23:58:04] <%+x_MrsDiamond_x> nope LUL
[2023-01-02 23:58:04] <@%Unclefood> @dirtXIII I'm not saying they didn't go straight and fast, but they looked like shit and it wouldn't cut it today. Imagine the player reaction to have bullshit looking bicycle animations LuL

[2023-01-02 23:58:22] <%+metrohman> hell get the spawn he wants after the corpse despawns
[2023-01-02 23:58:26] <%+tompty767> Another spawn bites the dust.
[2023-01-02 23:58:27] <Turbo_c4rl> tbh spawns in the middle of nowhere isnt that bad on livonia as to me livonia is a survival map rather than instant loot in towns on spawn
