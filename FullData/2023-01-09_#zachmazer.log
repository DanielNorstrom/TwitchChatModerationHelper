[2023-01-09 00:21:03] <kratos3mil> @zachmazer u can detonate the grenade launcher by letting go of trigger
[2023-01-09 00:21:04] <MELGOZA1999> you can choose to detonate by holding the trigger then letting go when it is close to it
[2023-01-09 00:21:05] <NoCapCollin> You need to learn how to properly shoot the grenade launcher
[2023-01-09 00:21:12] <+itzindica> When you use blinding it does like almost no damage
[2023-01-09 00:22:13] <@%+yayorozu> tell guild to put on lucent finisher in the artifact

[2023-01-09 00:48:45] <+deceptacus10> I mean, you could get a juicer exotic tbh
[2023-01-09 00:49:00] <%WhyZ_F> Having more than one character helps with pushing through hard cap but it becomes super grindy
[2023-01-09 00:49:01] <iBearsFPS> exotics have special perks so could be worth keeping
[2023-01-09 00:49:06] <l3l4j73> just don't forget to get it before the weekend is over
[2023-01-09 00:49:07] <+deceptacus10> Your main purpose for going to xur is to get an exotic
[2023-01-09 00:49:09] <+deceptacus10> Which is worth
[2023-01-09 00:49:23] <%WhyZ_F> You can always infuse it to higher light later

[2023-01-09 01:09:18] <%Liborioaddict> Is this game worthy trying on ps
[2023-01-09 01:09:34] <@%+yayorozu> if you like super grindy games
[2023-01-09 01:10:08] <+PKZapper> its grindy, but super grindy is a bit subjective. WoW and ESO are super grindy.

[2023-01-09 02:06:07] <+EnigmaticMarv> watching people learn this game is interesting
[2023-01-09 02:06:28] <IR15H> if i had to give you 3 important ones, 1 - slide corners, 2 - dont shoot and jump, 3 - dont be afraid to play mid range with hand cannons
[2023-01-09 02:06:39] <HazardousBC> if you dont take pvp seriously it can be fun

[2023-01-09 02:07:38] <ELITE__SURVIVORS> Once you learn the angles for each map you’ll be straight
[2023-01-09 02:07:51] <Hifoens> 180 rpm hand cannons are not good
[2023-01-09 02:08:17] <+concussedxx> mans hit every trap lmao
[2023-01-09 02:08:22] <+Arkman279> 7/10 of your deaths are because your running around corners, slow down and prepare for the engagement pre aim when you go around a corner they’re waiting for you to run in and getting the first shot and if you have to run around a corner slide
