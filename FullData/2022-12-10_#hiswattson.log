[2022-12-10 20:24:44] <@%^Nightbot> A few facts about wattson. He likes his soda/drinks room temperature. He eats ALL his meat (burgers and steak) well done. He invented pb milkies (spoon of pb and chug milk and repeat). His favorite lunch is mustard sandwiches. Wattson has complained his soup was too salty... he drank it straight from can without warming it up. Wattson enjoys the prowler unironicly. Wattson is originally from Arkansas (it's a real place).
