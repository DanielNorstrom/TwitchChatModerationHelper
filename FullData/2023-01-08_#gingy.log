[2023-01-08 01:33:36] <GiwrgosTzi> what gave away that he was cheating i dont understand
[2023-01-08 01:33:44] <goshtier> do u have #11WS or #21WS
[2023-01-08 01:33:56] <%Gowzambur> because he sounded like he was on top of you but somehow shot you from the the window on the left?
[2023-01-08 01:34:06] <%ogjoker88> I dont even see a bullet
[2023-01-08 01:34:16] <+sV_UncleJay> nah thats cheats 100%

[2023-01-08 01:34:31] <Hexilious> that glass break sounded from the right side tho
[2023-01-08 01:34:32] <%Gowzambur> yeah thats gotta be hacks or something
[2023-01-08 01:34:33] <pattchyy> he could have seen you through the store first but also could be sus
[2023-01-08 01:34:34] <%pikapii010> hah! he is lucky luke!
[2023-01-08 01:34:34] <f0osterTV> gg go next, report and move on, what can u do
[2023-01-08 01:34:36] <Dklider> cheating 100%
[2023-01-08 01:34:38] <Upsetrush> he shoot an than he run
[2023-01-08 01:34:44] <n3m1s1s_za> what is the chance that it was another player behind him in the dark? dont hate me just asking?
[2023-01-08 01:34:48] <Hexilious> i feel he was under you and clipped through the floor
[2023-01-08 01:34:49] <psychoz06> only logical thing is if the guy that peaked at the corner was NOT the one that shot you
[2023-01-08 01:34:49] <%+soyhammer_> is your birthday today Gingy?
[2023-01-08 01:34:50] <Upsetrush> this can't be so fast

[2023-01-08 01:34:55] <+KapDin1337> Yeah that's certainly very cheats-y
[2023-01-08 01:34:57] <psychoz06> maybe a teamate inside the store
[2023-01-08 01:35:00] <bontavi> you can see him in front of you. left peeking.
[2023-01-08 01:35:00] <psychoz06> on the left
[2023-01-08 01:35:06] <%$killerbrandt555> but it was a left hand peek too, which is odd!

[2023-01-08 03:11:53] <X_xStoneYx_X> Yes Memory=RAM
[2023-01-08 03:11:57] <Stormbreaker1002> how u see them? or u know he could be there?
[2023-01-08 03:12:03] <@%+jimmiedrum> eh, she wouldn't talk about it if she did @aenby
[2023-01-08 03:12:16] <Hexilious> I cant fucking find the Gunsmith 1 shotgun brake been searching for so long and checking fence too :(
[2023-01-08 03:12:18] <+PlutoniumFrog> I think the audio setting (I forget what it's called) is the cause of the memory leak. After disabling it, I haven't had any issues at all with the leaking causing a performance slowdown.
[2023-01-08 03:12:19] <@%+jimmiedrum> she likes to keep that kinda stuff private

[2023-01-08 14:45:57] <+johnnygrands> English probably isn't his first language.  He was probably just asking if you're raiding soon or something.  I doubt he meant disrespect.  But I could be wrong.

[2023-01-08 14:47:31] <%olternaut> lol met a little timmy the other day.  He literally screamed into his mic like a girl when i started shooting.
[2023-01-08 14:47:37] <Graddorict> does your streets lag also?
[2023-01-08 14:47:38] <%+robinjinxed> I have a new broken M4 build which is down to 22 recoil, it should not work at all as there is clipping parts with a new suppressor for a build which cannot take a supressor.
[2023-01-08 14:47:40] <%GorillaMonsoon25> Tactful means with thought and care
[2023-01-08 14:47:54] <+PsychoRifle> how "much" did they buff 855?
[2023-01-08 14:47:55] <bondzah> it helps its transition into mid wipe so much cause it fell off so hard
[2023-01-08 14:47:56] <Naught_XIII> @5cavlive5matt3r he was being considerate, he just worded it weird cause english isnt his first language
[2023-01-08 14:47:57] <%realScratchy> When you can‚Äôt kill scavs with the base M4, we‚Äôve got a problem
[2023-01-08 14:48:15] <+steevoo25> @5cavlive5matt3r oh okay. maybe it was how i said it

[2023-01-08 15:06:37] <+slevendegree> 32gb is best
[2023-01-08 15:06:42] <+Kjoebmand> 8? OMEGALUL
[2023-01-08 15:06:42] <+scotian> If youre building new, dont go under 32

[2023-01-08 15:06:57] <NoisySharkden> is 128gb ram enough hahahaha
[2023-01-08 15:06:57] <1337_potatoe> 32gb is almost a must nowadays,
[2023-01-08 15:06:58] <Volcomstone161> its been cut at 16
[2023-01-08 15:07:01] <%mikethespike66> 16 minimum ‚Ä¶. But keep xpc on!
[2023-01-08 15:07:03] <Coypote> 16GB still crashes the game on bigger maps
[2023-01-08 15:07:04] <YoungCore> running 64 just fine here
[2023-01-08 15:07:06] <!%getfarked> when you teeter over the 11gb-12gb usage of ram, your ram compresses the rest and when you compress storage over ram, it lags bag
[2023-01-08 15:07:07] <BlackSpiderDMT> that the 4 prong flash hider g36?
[2023-01-08 15:07:13] <!%getfarked> bad
[2023-01-08 15:07:14] <!%getfarked> *
[2023-01-08 15:07:14] <1337_potatoe> 16gb is soooo tight for almost anything now
[2023-01-08 15:07:17] <%+eff0ff23> it depends on the motherboard what speed is best for the ram
[2023-01-08 15:07:21] <+slevendegree> 16gb is no longer min for newer games
[2023-01-08 15:07:31] <BlackSpiderDMT> Gingy that flash hider only worth like 6-10k
[2023-01-08 15:07:33] <%+SouljahE46> I have 32gb and Tarkov never uses more than 14gb of RAM
[2023-01-08 15:07:33] <NoisySharkden> 128Gb is amazing for me so many apps can run
[2023-01-08 15:07:34] <BlackSpiderDMT> not worth keepin
[2023-01-08 15:07:37] <+steevoo25> @getfarked what?
[2023-01-08 15:07:38] <Coypote> 16GB will just give you unneeded frustration :D
[2023-01-08 15:07:42] <napalot> 16gb is ok with a ram clearing tool i dont remember what its called
[2023-01-08 15:07:43] <1337_potatoe> 16gb is not even good short term
[2023-01-08 15:07:50] <!%getfarked> getting a new pc soon and DDR5 is surprisingly cheep i learnt
[2023-01-08 15:07:50] <Triptic1988> i upgraded to 32 from 16, was a massive difference
[2023-01-08 15:08:01] <!%getfarked> if you got the right mobo, go DDR5
[2023-01-08 15:08:01] <%mikethespike66> RAM speed over 3000 peeps! It helpd!
[2023-01-08 15:08:07] <e1ghts8> u prettyy
[2023-01-08 15:08:11] <BlackSpiderDMT> 32gb is much needed for tarkov

[2023-01-08 16:05:58] <thetto1017> That‚Äôs true I kill so many people walking around with their laser on you just have to be smart about turning it on and off idky everyone runs around with them on

[2023-01-08 18:23:56] <%aEnby> Can be drivers crashing everything or even just Windows 11
[2023-01-08 18:24:00] <%CmTiger> it can be the GPU
[2023-01-08 18:24:03] <+TvJerkinGerkin> or a faulty ram stick
[2023-01-08 18:24:06] <SaneTG> shoot them in the face

[2023-01-08 18:24:24] <+Tarbane> @SplitSecondDE i was thinking that, i might try that
[2023-01-08 18:24:27] <JyLag> I also have constant crashes since new wipe.. was working fine before :(
[2023-01-08 18:24:29] <dzonitrez> @dzonitrez they literally killed my desire to play this game....too many of them :/
[2023-01-08 18:24:33] <+teebore> guy has issues, is an expert at what is wrong but cant fix problem.... good job bud
[2023-01-08 18:24:37] <%+Kelatron> it could be a GPU no doubt
[2023-01-08 18:24:40] <+scuzzzyyog> @LeeOnlineTV same 3070ti
[2023-01-08 18:24:42] <%ogjoker88> @Gingy  hes trying to troll you dont feed him

[2023-01-08 18:24:57] <Oblivious_Prime> @jacobcastle3 pretty argumentative to be fair.
[2023-01-08 18:24:57] <+SplitSecondDE> Also try clocking down anything else
[2023-01-08 18:25:01] <+ActuallyNasty> There can be system issues which cause crashes, but I dont think it is system related for most people because it has been happening as a widespread issue across the playerbase
[2023-01-08 18:25:02] <i4mthesenate> can we all appreciate how the reflection in her glasses is like 4k
[2023-01-08 18:25:03] <+1smallball> stop feeding the troll

But because of my IT background its one of those things where I know how easy it is to cheat sure. but I also know how fucked this game is at times so just saying "well i have x hours so i know when its cheats" isnt proof, show me a clip of someone flying or not dying then sure.

[2023-01-08 20:25:07] <cynn_710s> lighthouse is the least populated map rn
[2023-01-08 20:25:19] <%narsilbladee> any clues, to what the electronic componets is for? i know its a trade
[2023-01-08 20:25:32] <lNimmyl> even tho customs has a decent amount of pvp i think its a good new player map because it teaches you spawns and rotates and routes early on
[2023-01-08 20:25:37] <+papadom812> @osodriiippy if your running solors bro imo woods interchange and customs would be the safer route and scav reserve
[2023-01-08 20:25:37] <+BlackenedHeaven> I reallllly hope they try to patch the audio a bit soon lol my brain hurts from the audio after like 9 hours of tarky lol

[2023-01-08 22:27:05] <%dominantruss> @xVerKx I usally learn the major landmark of the map, and figure out which sections lead where. Like woods' sniper rock, or the big pond south of the map
[2023-01-08 22:27:06] <%+agonie07> woods is far from relaxing for me, it is the most stressful map, knowing i can get sniped from anyware xD
