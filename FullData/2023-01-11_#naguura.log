[2023-01-11 14:45:23] <KohioDotA2> ring is unique equipped
[2023-01-11 14:45:40] <%+WeaselMuffin> yeah you can have 2
[2023-01-11 14:45:46] <KohioDotA2> the other one counts as embellished no?
[2023-01-11 14:45:51] <sh_ift> double ring is good unless you want the fire dmg ring from raid
[2023-01-11 14:46:00] <%warryvibe> I was hoping for trinket from CoS but I got trinket from Halls naguuraSadge
