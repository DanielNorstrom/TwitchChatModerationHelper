[2023-01-08 11:41:41] <!%supernova1123> Another factor is that G game players like to indulge themselves in game characters, generate lust, and then become productive forces, generating a variety of R18, and then a group of cult atmosphere. The game itself has nothing to play, and can only sell stories and characters. Its greatest contribution may be to produce a lot of MMDs that people like to watch and all kinds of things you know xdd
