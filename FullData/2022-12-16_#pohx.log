[2022-12-16 00:00:16] <+milmac96> thank you :)
[2022-12-16 00:00:19] <Megabiaaz> Even that rf is way too slow for my personal taste I really like your rf wiki. Very awesome job done!
[2022-12-16 00:00:24] <@%GoGoLoThirty> the FAQ explains it really well too. you can even say to just ctrl+F on the FAQ for pantheon :o
[2022-12-16 00:00:27] <s00wka> Hey, I've got a question not covered in FAQ, What about adding fortify to your shield charge setup and get unset ring for your infernal cry?

[2022-12-16 00:01:31] <@%lemoncoolers> RF is far from slow
[2022-12-16 00:01:34] <+FF2002Buff> I just wanted to say thank you for all the content.  This is my second league with RF and I am having a lot of fun.  Thanks!
[2022-12-16 00:02:09] <%Dizzlekrew> hhah cool badge. ok I have to find a video for the jun mechanic, first real league, so much to learn. Sad since I've been a POE member since 2011.
[2022-12-16 00:02:15] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lemoncoolers Seriously, not even joking, the biggest issue with this build is its gonna make every other build feel like shit from now on lol... not looking forward to RF detox
[2022-12-16 00:02:22] <Junx91> Hey Pohx, what made you choose SC?
[2022-12-16 00:02:26] <%+lonelyproton> Without ignite immunity does that make immortal flesh worse due to less uptime of inc armor? Or do you care more about he regen from it?
[2022-12-16 00:02:36] <s00wka> @Ncc1708 I wonder why it doesnt work
[2022-12-16 00:02:40] <+Arastir> @Pohx what about Apothecary gloves, has dmg over time impliciit
[2022-12-16 00:02:46] <@%lemoncoolers> yeah I theorycraft other builds and I'm like.. RF is just better.
[2022-12-16 00:02:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Dizzlekrew yo welcome back!!! Im just getting back into the game bigtime too since years ago :) Check out Zizarans vid on Betrayal league

[2022-12-16 00:02:57] <%Dizzlekrew> ok i will ty!
[2022-12-16 00:03:25] <+Sazulo> too  much stress on hardcore. Already have the job for that
[2022-12-16 00:03:32] VIEWERS: 1 884
[2022-12-16 00:03:42] <Junx91> Aah oke, does your build get impacted at all by going SC? Or is the dmg already that high that you'll not really adjust it?
[2022-12-16 00:03:58] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah i mean the thing is that hardcore has changed bigtime over the years. The issue is that the goal is the same as it is in standard, you dont really do things that differently, you just have the adrenaline i guess. which wears off
[2022-12-16 00:04:39] <Junx91> Yea, I've been playing it at HCSSF, really enjoy it! Amazing guide as well
[2022-12-16 00:04:51] <+Lappenforce> cant decided between maw of mischief or this legendary build, any advice?

[2022-12-16 00:05:43] <@%GoGoLoThirty> can confirm, ive been cruising since i turned on RF LUL
[2022-12-16 00:06:03] <s00wka> @Ncc1708 did you mean u didnt get fortify or that u couldnt use infernal cry?
[2022-12-16 00:06:26] <TheCosmicAstro> ive gotten a lot of DPS check essence monsters and im quite heavily geared and i still cant kill them lol
[2022-12-16 00:06:32] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @s00wka fortify wont proc much because you need resolute technique is the issue. which you can get for 1 point but yeah
[2022-12-16 00:06:35] <+Lappenforce> yea im playing ek ignite atm, destroying maps but high tier content like bossing is a chore because survivability, sick of it tbh

[2022-12-16 00:08:57] <+Mr_Horrible> Hey, just wanted to stop by to say thanks for all the great work you put in! RF Jugg has been my fastest smoothest league start so far, really low-stress and tons of fun. Got a lucky +50-something% total dot multi sceptre the other day and cleaning up my atlas now, haven't had to spend anything outside of 10c for a 6L starter
[2022-12-16 00:09:13] <s00wka> 1 point seems fair for fortify @GoGoLoThirty SeemsGood

[2022-12-16 00:10:15] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @s00wka yeah I mean the build is really minmaxed already imo. you dont need the extra tankiness, it wont let you tank any of the turbo 1shots (which are sorta the only thing that kills you) and more damage will improve everything drastically. thats just how I see it tho i guess
[2022-12-16 00:10:30] <+squirtlax> will you enchant your helmet in the future if you could?

[2022-12-16 00:10:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @s00wka I think probably as an interim point while you are getting defences set up, it could be very worth, try it out

[2022-12-16 00:12:34] <thepirateboyosama> for how much the 22 gem lol
[2022-12-16 00:12:36] <@%GoGoLoThirty> always be levelling stuff in your weapon swap! thats an ancient OG strat, still very applicable these days :))
[2022-12-16 00:12:47] <@%lemoncoolers> @thepirateboyosama check poe.ninja
[2022-12-16 00:12:50] <s00wka> In this case u dont trade dmg for defences since it only requires getting unset ring instead of amethyst one, so u lose a bit of chaos res but it is evened out by fortify buff and all other damage types are a cherry on top @GoGoLoThirty
[2022-12-16 00:12:53] <+Lappenforce> do you prefer jugg or inq ?
[2022-12-16 00:12:55] <+b0xoflunch> is there a trick to find lab trials? I'm on teir 15 maps. I've got all the lab atlas tree nodes

[2022-12-16 20:11:09] <%Xuletz> I'd much rather use a second life flask with burn remove

[2022-12-16 20:14:05] <AisForAcronym> I saw something on the PoB that I had a question about. The "96+" Void Sceptre shows "Adds Fire Damage" as a prefix. Does that add to Fire Trap or RF damage? I thought it only adds to weapon damage.
[2022-12-16 20:14:08] <@%lemoncoolers> @Toesoe I can't remember the last time I did a vaal side area. They're a waste of time imo. You can run them if you like ofc
[2022-12-16 20:14:10] <+LightcallerTV> I immediately got a chisel altar and i can confirm singles do drop!

[2022-12-16 20:19:26] <@^Nightbot> You buy/farm a set of Death or Light and Truth divination cards that gives a unique scepter. You make new level 4 character. You turn in the set on it. You vaal the scepter in the hopes it turns rare. You get other 4 rare bases of the same scepter by casually playing the game. Vendor them with the one you corrupted into a rare. Then you get a rare ilvl 4 Rare clean scepter. How to craft. On average you need 16 scorch fossils to get +1 fire and fire dot multi. - Oct0_Pus
[2022-12-16 20:19:47] <+kefresh122> i'm following your guide for build, i think it's the easiest league starter i've tried since i started playing poe
[2022-12-16 20:19:57] <%lucasTi> Did the crafting changes last league make crafting the RF helm and scepter harder?

[2022-12-16 20:25:02] <%$EugeneBeanblossom> What does mapping mean?
[2022-12-16 20:25:05] <%$EugeneBeanblossom> oh

[2022-12-16 20:25:12] <PrimeBlackDodo> Mapping means: you have to decide what you want to do and there are 55 options LUL
[2022-12-16 20:25:13] <+GIMMETHEL00T> I tmeans putting maps in your atlas and doing them
[2022-12-16 20:25:16] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @EugeneBeanblossom go watch a youtube video on the atlas (a new one, from like 3.17 or later)
[2022-12-16 20:25:17] <mtchase326> Hello everyone! I crafted a helmet that has lvl 20 conc/burning dmg with 10% mana reservation efficiency, is this a valuable mod over %30 more dmg?

[2022-12-16 20:25:38] <%$EugeneBeanblossom> Thanks all
[2022-12-16 20:25:48] <PrimeBlackDodo> Mapping is so overwhelming when you are new or pretty new to it, it is insane, but it is also the fresh new start of the game you gonna love
[2022-12-16 20:25:50] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @EugeneBeanblossom no problem, enjoy, this is when the game gets cool :D
[2022-12-16 20:25:57] <maximenn> Actually talking about delve do you think jugg or inq is better there and can go deeper?
[2022-12-16 20:26:09] <mtchase326> Hi Pohx, I figured I'd ask the RF god if my helmet is worth selling or if i should continue to craft it.  :P
[2022-12-16 20:26:20] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @maximenn jugg RF has been dope for delving so far. you take a burn immune flask and shits ezclap
[2022-12-16 20:26:24] <+devilcry10> Hey Pohx i just crafted a helmet and im not sure if the mods are good ? Can you pls take a look ? The Global chat is kinda troling me or not responding
[2022-12-16 20:26:46] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @devilcry10 use global 911 they are usually pretty good

[2022-12-16 20:27:49] <@%lemoncoolers> @mtchase326 of course
[2022-12-16 20:28:24] <mtchase326> Yeah, i happened upon it while I was crafting my boneshatter helmet :(

[2022-12-16 20:52:11] <+postal291> hey quick question, is there a guide or something for how to choose which harvest to hatch in sacred groves?  Looked around and all I can find is older content which had the crafts on the popup...
[2022-12-16 20:52:11] <TheSkadooshOfDestiny> Anyone got tips for a noob on farming for currency? I rarely can even get to T12 maps lol
[2022-12-16 20:52:13] <mitussss> medium armor stacking probably
[2022-12-16 20:52:15] <@%lemoncoolers> the jewels have to be really good to be worth it
[2022-12-16 20:52:20] <%+FatRat_> I like rolling cluster jewels to sell :)

[2022-12-16 20:54:11] <@%lemoncoolers> @enololtv you mule it from a templar. It's covered in the guide

[2022-12-16 20:54:49] <%+HughMorrisMD> this is only half serious, but im guessing its not really viable to use scion for RF, too much effort and not enough payoff

[2022-12-16 23:29:22] <+DannyCMan> so how many clicks are that crafting on average? KEKW
[2022-12-16 23:29:29] <@%GoGoLoThirty> approx 940 chaos says CoE
[2022-12-16 23:29:37] <+ttnngg123> 2 belts
[2022-12-16 23:29:39] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yes Hunter % life is another good way imo
[2022-12-16 23:29:39] <Strollein> Harvest more likely is gone right?
