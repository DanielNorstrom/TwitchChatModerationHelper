[2022-12-05 10:25:20] <%MintCastella> this game has so many of those
[2022-12-05 10:25:46] <%Edibleghost> it's not rocket science
[2022-12-05 10:25:46] <%MoonStorm3d> C is a down facing Camera on your ship
[2022-12-05 10:25:51] <%Steelback78> You don't need to be sorry. This is apart of the game.  To explore and try ideas outside the box.

[2022-12-05 10:27:37] <%+LoadingPleaseWT> can you die in this game, or does it just reset you?
[2022-12-05 10:27:50] <%Inbred_Potato> Why it got wood on it
[2022-12-05 10:28:04] <%+LoadingPleaseWT> I dont think Wood acting as an exhaust port works
[2022-12-05 10:28:05] <casaubon_> you got the latest model
[2022-12-05 10:28:09] <%+Thrakerzaahg> @LoadingPleaseWT You die when you're killed

[2022-12-05 10:28:25] <zeromatter21> People die when they are killed
[2022-12-05 10:28:28] <Atomicsteamengine> @LoadingPleaseWT That depends on the propellant you use

[2022-12-05 10:30:41] <oxxyjoe> just put it on your wishlist or straight out buy it, it's so good and worth savoring
[2022-12-05 10:30:55] <%hamood194> Game is completely reliant on exploration and knowledge pretty much
[2022-12-05 10:31:03] <%Churroboros> "I want to look at this" *headbutts*
[2022-12-05 10:31:19] <%+LoadingPleaseWT> uh gravity pulled it into its orbit?

[2022-12-05 10:31:47] <%k_yama_> game truly took the concept of "fuck around find out" and ran with it
[2022-12-05 10:31:53] <%k_yama_> and it's so damn good

[2022-12-05 10:33:12] <%DebiruBoi> I think I saw a repair prompt inside it.
[2022-12-05 10:33:23] <%czerno333> i think the gravity thing is inside
[2022-12-05 10:33:26] <%MintCastella> the signal scope will help a lot with that
[2022-12-05 10:33:33] <%MintCastella> oh look at the crystal inside
[2022-12-05 10:33:43] <%Steelback78> The crystal in the ship is what's creating the gravity
[2022-12-05 10:33:44] <%+Thrakerzaahg> Isn't the gravity controlled by the purple crystal?
[2022-12-05 10:33:54] <%MoonStorm3d> the cristal remember

[2022-12-05 10:40:24] <+elephantnut> it‚Äôs so wonderful
[2022-12-05 10:40:28] <Metaldeer> this was in development for quite a while
[2022-12-05 10:40:28] <thepurplebeanie> so everyone's gameplay is unique in a way
[2022-12-05 10:40:32] <%Reaganomicon> this was their uni project turned actual commercial game
[2022-12-05 10:40:32] <%monononny> I never saw much of it but art style reminds me of firewatch
[2022-12-05 10:40:37] <Winter404> Mobius Digital, so far, has only really made this game if I recall correctly
[2022-12-05 10:40:43] <%DarkScarletMage> YEP
[2022-12-05 10:40:44] <E_Tap> it's so subtly foreshadowed in the intro space museum with the sun exhibit
[2022-12-05 10:40:51] <%MoonStorm3d> Na just this game and the DLC
[2022-12-05 10:40:55] <%Churroboros> now she'll be trapped in this loop for another 90 years
[2022-12-05 10:41:02] <%czerno333> there's so much to this game and it's an amazing thing to experience without previous knowledge
[2022-12-05 10:41:06] <%MoonStorm3d> but who knows what next
[2022-12-05 10:41:15] <%Fleshy> the same dev team also made stray!
[2022-12-05 10:41:21] <casaubon_> a universe-sized mystery
[2022-12-05 10:41:24] <+9727032> just this and the dlc, and the dlc is really gud
[2022-12-05 10:41:29] <Winter404> @Fleshy they didn't
[2022-12-05 10:41:30] <%Fleshy> or at least the same publisher!
[2022-12-05 10:41:37] <%tekdemo> @Fleshy Same publisher, yeah.
[2022-12-05 10:41:43] <%Reaganomicon> Stray was Annapurna

[2022-12-05 10:42:14] <Metaldeer> clicking on the developer on the steam page is misleading, it just shows annapurna's stuff
