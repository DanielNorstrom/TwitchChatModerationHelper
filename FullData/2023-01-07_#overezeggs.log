[2023-01-07 03:20:23] <%SchnozBott> on the other hand, a degree in anything does look good on a resume

[2023-01-07 03:50:29] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> might need a new battery AJ, they tend to start going off if it's dying
[2023-01-07 03:50:42] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> TBF they texted me about it about 2 hours ago now? idk why it is going off now, and why I didn't get a text earlier today when it went off before, but whatever
[2023-01-07 03:50:51] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> @DarkRaigeFire it is a new CO2 detector
[2023-01-07 03:50:53] <ClownFishCGUK> Thanks, I'm just wondering what bushes etc you use, your art looks good and I'm struggling to pick up digital painting
[2023-01-07 03:51:21] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> ah, well I'd be worried it's either faulty or there is a slow leak somewhere
[2023-01-07 03:51:27] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> both are bad

[2023-01-07 03:57:28] <ClownFishCGUK> sadly the pen isnt showing up for me in the clip store search, was it part of a brush pack or something (sorry I'm new to clip studio too)

[2023-01-07 03:58:51] <!%$operatorviera> there are places where it snows
[2023-01-07 03:58:58] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> tbh a specific brush isn't going to make or break your art, it really is more about finding what works for you and practicing
[2023-01-07 03:59:00] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> @T0X1X_CAMPER they are doing that for Monday for me, and the fact they don't have enough parking for it, kills me
[2023-01-07 03:59:03] <!%$operatorviera> more like 3 nema
[2023-01-07 03:59:14] <%$nemafow> The other two dont count OV

[2023-01-07 04:00:29] <%$nemafow> HUH
[2023-01-07 04:00:42] <%$nemafow> We have guns
[2023-01-07 04:00:47] <%$nemafow> Just not EVERYONE has them
[2023-01-07 04:01:00] <!%$operatorviera> and there are no ARs
[2023-01-07 04:01:03] <%$nemafow> A safety course, then apply for a license

[2023-01-07 04:01:10] <%$nemafow> Provide references
[2023-01-07 04:01:14] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it's like specific types and licensing
[2023-01-07 04:01:32] <%$nemafow> You need someone who has some standing in the community to vouch for youy
[2023-01-07 04:01:33] <!%$operatorviera> and all guns are registered

[2023-01-07 04:02:17] <%$nemafow> You cannot own a firearm if you have any inditable offence, which is basically conviction
[2023-01-07 04:02:34] <%$nemafow> Banned for life
[2023-01-07 04:02:45] <%$nemafow> You also give up some of your rights
[2023-01-07 04:02:52] <%$nemafow> Police can enter your home without asking
[2023-01-07 04:03:12] <%$nemafow> You are dealt more harshly if you ever get in trouble with the law

[2023-01-07 04:03:50] <%$nemafow> The entering without asking is more to do with checking your storage
[2023-01-07 04:04:00] <%YaBoiSkeletorr> idk why theres so many cops that have powertrips like that and just brwk the law because theyre cops
[2023-01-07 04:04:01] <%$nemafow> But if you deny them, they are 100% gonna take away your license/firearms
[2023-01-07 04:04:02] <%jrodsterzz> AINT NO WAY YOUR LISTENING TO THIS
[2023-01-07 04:04:03] <%jrodsterzz> OMG
[2023-01-07 04:04:03] <%$aa_rochelle7> Isn‚Äôt this the song from that Warriors animation?
[2023-01-07 04:04:13] <%$T0X1X_CAMPER> feel like this song was in one of those videos we watches?
[2023-01-07 04:04:18] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> KEKW nothing cops do here is illegal anymore Egg
[2023-01-07 04:04:20] <%$nemafow> The REGISTERED firearms must be stored correctly
[2023-01-07 04:04:24] <%jrodsterzz> this song brings back so many memories omg
[2023-01-07 04:04:27] <!%$operatorviera> They can't do a illegal search of your property, but they are allowed to check how you store ya guns
[2023-01-07 04:04:27] <%Ucantseeme6920> Why did I think this is a fnaf song?
[2023-01-07 04:04:27] <+OtterPop1371> QUICK DELETE YOUR BROWSER HISTORY IN AUSTRALIA
[2023-01-07 04:04:41] <%$nemafow> Yeah, why should I care?
[2023-01-07 04:04:45] <%jrodsterzz> @Ucantseeme6920 bro it is
[2023-01-07 04:04:47] <%$nemafow> I got a firearm
[2023-01-07 04:04:55] <%$nemafow> Its considered a privilege here
[2023-01-07 04:04:56] <%$nemafow> Not a right

[2023-01-07 04:05:05] <%$nemafow> Thats the difference
[2023-01-07 04:05:13] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> nah its not that bad, its literally to check if you are storing firearms in the safe/required manner and ammo isnt being stored with said firearms

[2023-01-07 04:06:02] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> yes you should do that here too
[2023-01-07 04:06:12] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it's HEAVILY reccomended
[2023-01-07 04:06:13] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> thhey just make a ton of hoops to jump through to get and maintain a firearm
[2023-01-07 04:06:16] <!%$operatorviera> yes ammo is seperate from guns
[2023-01-07 04:06:20] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> and in some cases required even in the US
[2023-01-07 04:06:22] <%$nemafow> Your license specifies the LEGAL reason why you need the firearm/s
[2023-01-07 04:06:33] <%+chipsenpaiuwu> I keep all mine in one big trash bag
[2023-01-07 04:06:33] <%$nemafow> Whether hunting, sports shooting
[2023-01-07 04:06:43] <%$nemafow> And no, home defense is not a valid reason
[2023-01-07 04:07:09] <%$nemafow> You will be charged actually if you use it in self defense
[2023-01-07 04:07:11] <!%$operatorviera> we are expected to still call the police in case of a robbery
[2023-01-07 04:07:23] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> our laws are designed in a way where its better to not defend ourselves
[2023-01-07 04:07:37] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> cant carry knives etc either

[2023-01-07 04:07:58] <%Jaccquee> hai
[2023-01-07 04:08:03] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> if you carry a knife and use it in self defence, you can get charged for carrying a knife
[2023-01-07 04:08:07] <%$nemafow> As I said, its not a legal reason to own one
[2023-01-07 04:08:08] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> I mean, also Egg, the amount of gun crimes in other countries is insanely small, violent crimes are a whole different game in other countries
[2023-01-07 04:08:12] <%leafburn550> But what about my farmer on porch with shotgun and lemonade fantasies

[2023-01-07 04:08:38] <+OtterPop1371> @OverEzEggs we'll be long dead before the cops show up in america
[2023-01-07 04:08:41] <%$nemafow> But I mean, we arent being home invaded or robbed as much
[2023-01-07 04:08:45] <%$nemafow> HAI JJ
[2023-01-07 04:08:53] <%$nemafow> I have never been robbed
[2023-01-07 04:08:57] <%+chipsenpaiuwu> when seconds matter, help is minutes away
[2023-01-07 04:09:07] <!%$operatorviera> I mean it would take the cops probs about a 3 minutes to get from the local station to me
[2023-01-07 04:09:17] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> the only issue here is when there is gun crime, 98% of the time is not a registered firearm and they then penalise lawful firearm owners which is kinda fucked imo
[2023-01-07 04:09:20] <%$nemafow> Yeah maybe 4 minutes to me

[2023-01-07 04:10:12] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> in america though our police literally keep themselves understanffed to lobby for more funding, they do that shit on purpose
[2023-01-07 04:10:17] <%$nemafow> Gotta remember
[2023-01-07 04:10:26] <%$nemafow> You guys get firearm violence on the news every night yeah?
[2023-01-07 04:10:31] <%$nemafow> Very rare here
[2023-01-07 04:10:46] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> ours spend 90% of their time in unmarked cars trying to catch speeding drivers (in my area at least)
[2023-01-07 04:10:56] <!%$operatorviera> we have more stabbing here
[2023-01-07 04:10:59] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> so they dont have a huge deal to do otherwise lol
[2023-01-07 04:11:08] <%+UrufuDarkLord> yeah
[2023-01-07 04:11:18] <%$nemafow> The only firearm violence here is usually some dude in a farm hiding from the police and there is a stand off
[2023-01-07 04:11:30] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> or a bikie gang at war
[2023-01-07 04:11:32] <%$nemafow> So true Rabid KEKW
[2023-01-07 04:11:34] <!%$operatorviera> OR biker gangs nema

[2023-01-07 04:11:47] <%JBookwyrm> I called the cops because i was watching people break into vehicles on a security camera and it took them 25minutes to show up
[2023-01-07 04:11:49] <%$nemafow> Yeah but criminal on criminal violence is okay

[2023-01-07 04:14:39] <%+UrufuDarkLord> My dad had to call the cops to report a theft of his tools and we WAITED 4 HOURS
[2023-01-07 04:14:43] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> yeah i was, turned on the news and was like huh...alrighty then guess this is a thing
[2023-01-07 04:14:47] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> as also a "liberal" here who likes guns and owns one, I also whole heartedly believe we need to adopt laws similar to other countries like Aus (maybe not exactly but similar) our refusal and the innacessable mental and physical care is literally why there are school shooting every other month here
[2023-01-07 04:15:00] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> the HOW we do that, I do not know lol

[2023-01-07 04:15:23] <!%$operatorviera> they would have labeled that a low threat crime is why you waited so long
[2023-01-07 04:15:28] <%$nemafow> I think you guys gotta fix alot of other shit before you fix that
[2023-01-07 04:15:35] <%$nemafow> Just based on what you guys have told me

[2023-01-07 04:16:02] <%+Rabid_Gerbil> the access to mental health support has had a huge push in Aus which make a big difference
[2023-01-07 04:16:12] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> @nemafow it's all sorta become an interconnected issue over all
[2023-01-07 04:16:20] <%$nemafow> That sucks
[2023-01-07 04:16:27] <%ChRisBoSs87> sport hunting should be fucking outlawed brother tbh like even in competitive fishing they throw em back
[2023-01-07 04:16:52] <!%$operatorviera> I only fish like the Pugsley Addams
[2023-01-07 04:17:27] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> our mental healthcare is honestly one of the biggest things we need to work on in the grand scheme of things because of how much it effects EVERYTHING else, but that's tied into healthcare in general and just the social state of the country as a whole
[2023-01-07 04:17:35] <+Kn0ckavelli> Hey everyone hope all is well
[2023-01-07 04:17:45] <%+UrufuDarkLord> there are regulations for hunting (depending on the state) you can't have more than 5 rounds in the mag. would like to see more of that in hunting

[2023-01-07 04:20:17] <!%$operatorviera> I mean that would be a large part of it, but not the only part
[2023-01-07 04:20:24] <%+UrufuDarkLord> @nemafow Unless you're vegetarian than murder applies to more than humans
[2023-01-07 04:20:45] <%$nemafow> The legal definition is murder does not apply to animals
[2023-01-07 04:20:47] <%ChRisBoSs87> theres a few good trout spots round my town mostly Crappie tho and them bitches be quick

[2023-01-07 04:24:57] <%+UrufuDarkLord> something I found interesting is there is a nation that requires a certain length of time to be served in the military once you turn 18, that is mostly for firearms training
[2023-01-07 04:25:09] <!%$operatorviera> when i told my school mates that i went rabbit hunting they asked me how i could kill such cute animals and i said have you seen a wild rabbit. They are feral as fuck

[2023-01-07 05:32:30] <%$Jackthereaper2312> Cheer100 PC builders of Egg's chat, I ask your opinion: positive, negative, or neutral air pressure? I have 3 120mm intakes (4 counting PSU) and one 120mm exhaust. Also, egg, I can never say it enough- your art is always big dick quality
[2023-01-07 05:32:56] <%$girlswearbeanies> floppy disks hehehee
[2023-01-07 05:33:24] <LFVelasco> @Jackthereaper2312 iirc positive is the recommended
[2023-01-07 05:33:28] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> All I know is that the airflow needs to come in one side an go out another lmao
[2023-01-07 05:33:48] <%$Jackthereaper2312> Positive is better for dust.
[2023-01-07 05:33:50] <LFVelasco> yes

[2023-01-07 05:34:08] <%$Jackthereaper2312> lemme just load test my GPU and see how hot it gets
[2023-01-07 05:34:10] <!%CoopKaiju> Also, don‚Äôt count the PSU fan, it exhausts its own heat
[2023-01-07 05:34:11] <%JBookwyrm> I prefer positive pressure just because that means the intake filter works instead of dust seeping into every small opening
[2023-01-07 05:34:27] <%$Jackthereaper2312> fair
[2023-01-07 05:34:28] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> slight positive pressure, if possible
[2023-01-07 05:34:45] <%+htaedgfmo> also clean the inside every once in a while, gamers.
[2023-01-07 05:34:48] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> better for dust
[2023-01-07 05:35:00] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> yeah I just make sure none of my fans are blocked and dust it regularly
[2023-01-07 05:35:22] <%jrodsterzz> you have to clean your fans every 6-7 months on average I think
[2023-01-07 05:35:27] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> slight positive pressure will help dust only build up on your fan filter, or mostly on your fan filters

[2023-01-07 05:38:44] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> @brahslaws yes, because your computer will throttle itself if it gets too hot, my CPU is not going to kill itself
[2023-01-07 05:39:01] <%JBookwyrm> For cases with poor airflow I just install higher static pressure fans lol
[2023-01-07 05:39:20] <%brahslaws> How will it get too hot from dusting it out once a month?
[2023-01-07 05:39:51] <C0zyMell0> @YaBoiSkeletorr sounds cliche but PRACTICE. draw in a bunch of different styles until you find something you like and feel confy with. dont be afraid to use reference. its not cheating, its really helpful. also there are a bunch of youtube tutorials to draw certain body parts or certain things, watch a bunch of those until there is something you feel comfy with and like

[2023-01-07 08:43:36] <DiRektEXE> What are your thoughts on AI art programs? Also, I made a realistic depiction of the Phoenix enemies from stage 2 in Thunder Force 3. wish i could send it to you in some way. i have multiple. I think this is how the Phoenix enemies on Gorgon should be depicted as. Thunder Force 3's box art depicts them as cyborgs but i think its more fitting to depict them as supernatural entities (Fire Phoenix Elemental) or a swarm of nanomachines working together.
