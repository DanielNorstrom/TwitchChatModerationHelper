[2023-01-05 11:00:38] <+Gorasu> Interesting how Pact story is closely intertwined with Tamriel wide pandemic which happened before ESO story. Knahaten Flu started from Stormhold.

[2023-01-05 11:06:45] <+Gorasu> Murkmire was basically stand-alone DLC.

[2023-01-05 11:09:00] <%Skybree_nz> summerset was and still is my fav
[2023-01-05 11:09:02] <+Gorasu> Shadowfen was last area of Pact areas. Main plot for Alliance starts from starting town (Pact, Davons Watch. AD, Vulkhel guard. Covenant, Daggerfall)
[2023-01-05 11:09:10] <+combonumber8> hey there Shay

[2023-01-05 11:10:17] <%Skybree_nz> they made the DLC during covid, it shows ...
[2023-01-05 11:10:21] <+Gorasu> Before those towns there were starter areas (Bleakrock for Pact, Khenarti Roost for AD and Stros M'Kai, then Bethnik for Covenant)
[2023-01-05 11:10:36] <+combonumber8> thx Shay
[2023-01-05 11:11:04] <%Skybree_nz> @combonumber8 Kia kaha bud

[2023-01-05 11:12:43] <+combonumber8> I could DM you some of what's going on
[2023-01-05 11:13:05] <+combonumber8> I just don't want to say in chat

[2023-01-05 11:14:12] <+Gorasu> I did once Master Angler achievement. By fishing everything everywhere. Took a long time.
[2023-01-05 11:15:17] <%Skybree_nz> you will need monster helms for healer
[2023-01-05 11:15:34] VIEWERS: 26
[2023-01-05 11:16:27] <+combonumber8> it's in your Discord
[2023-01-05 11:16:33] <+Gorasu> Well, good healer. Right skills, right stats, right champion points, right gear. Or just ton of magicka to heal constantly. Generally magicka templars are regarded best for healing. Warden is a bit jack of all trades class.
[2023-01-05 11:16:48] <+combonumber8> I would wait until after stream to read it
[2023-01-05 11:16:50] <%Skybree_nz> dungons on hard mode, drops a monter helm, then undaunted keys to getvtge shoulders
[2023-01-05 11:17:27] <%Skybree_nz> I gave up on healer, gear spec was a bit to hard for me as a solo player
[2023-01-05 11:17:28] <carlostattoo_ur> OMG! Your game look Amazing and pretty ‚ô•

[2023-01-05 11:18:22] <carlostattoo_ur> sorry for the question but... The Warden is better with bow or abilities of use stamine?
[2023-01-05 11:18:44] <+combonumber8> I will say that listening to you helps a little overall
[2023-01-05 11:19:05] <+Gorasu> Yep, for some reason Zenimax didn't create servers for Asia timezone. Don't really know why.
[2023-01-05 11:19:31] <%Skybree_nz> @gorasu coz they are cheep ... lol

[2023-01-05 11:20:34] <+Gorasu> Money was definetly issue back in 2014. I mean they laid off lots of developers before publishing. And then came terrible launch.
[2023-01-05 11:20:53] <carlostattoo_ur> hehehe the name of this bow... Lamae in the lore is the first lady vampire? i don¬¥t remember :D
[2023-01-05 11:20:57] <+Gorasu> Amazingly good progress Zenimax devs did after that.
[2023-01-05 11:21:14] <+Gorasu> Lamae Beolfag

[2023-01-05 11:24:41] <%Skybree_nz> is that a warden?

[2023-01-05 11:35:39] <+Gorasu> Basically you can check craftable set from wiki and ask someone to craft it for you - then replace it when you find better sets. Enchantments and proper traits helps you to be say, good healer. ESO is not as equipment centric like WoW Classic but sets help a lot.

[2023-01-05 11:44:20] <+Gorasu> That would be good idea to do alliance questline with one character.
[2023-01-05 11:45:14] <+Gorasu> You can do fighters guild and mages guild and eso main quest with tandem of alliance quest. That is how it was originally planned anyway.

[2023-01-05 12:59:02] <%+murdrin> It looks better than the Skyrim dragons
[2023-01-05 12:59:28] <+splinterstatue1> they definitely did a good job on elsweyr
[2023-01-05 12:59:37] <+Gorasu> You should go to dragon which is attacked by other players. The dragon icon will turn different and blink when it is challenged.

[2023-01-05 13:02:17] <+Gorasu> Zenimax devs actually went and asked help from Bethesda how to animate those dragons. So they look and act like ones in Skyrim.
