[2023-01-06 15:14:20] <%JtotheDizzle> I feel like Viss and Ham are good for a solid 5 dubs for Friday.
[2023-01-06 15:14:26] <+AndrewReise> you'd be surprised

[2023-01-06 15:15:08] <%+Ursas1> Good morning everyone!
[2023-01-06 15:15:11] <rwscheerer> @ThePrimeagen in here like there is some kind of fancy split keyboard or something brkMleet
[2023-01-06 15:15:13] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> Pettis wanting the Paul fight for his first in PFL. Who would we take in that fight?
[2023-01-06 15:15:16] <%Sweetiecheeks31> good mornin viss and the pack!!!
[2023-01-06 15:15:19] <+TryAndKeepUpPlz> I believe that if PUBG was released today as it is today, it would be the top game and my man Viss would be the largest (besides muscle mass which he already is) on Twitch

[2023-01-06 15:16:07] <%fractaleyes> Paul will never fight anyone he could actually lose to, whether it's a BS no-KO clause or just going against retired 47 year olds

[2023-01-06 15:16:18] <%JtotheDizzle> Showtime will embarrass Jake in MMA. Jake will never take that fight.
[2023-01-06 15:16:22] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> I really wanna see him fight Nate just for the content and build up.
[2023-01-06 15:16:35] <%+thatcurtguy> you were on my fyp daily
[2023-01-06 15:16:35] <%JtotheDizzle> There‚Äôs a reason he challenged Diaz. Jake is very intentionally selective of his fights.
[2023-01-06 15:17:10] <rwscheerer> Jake be taking those shots towards back of the head with the inside of his gloves - *almost* dirty

[2023-01-06 18:55:42] <%RedShadowHTX> @GhostStylez all preference. You can go higher with lower in game sensitivity too. For example I think Tanner plays at like 1-1.5k DPI or something like that?

[2023-01-06 18:57:16] <%+GhostStylez> @RedShadowHTX I see, thanks for the info. Guess I need to do some digging into it
[2023-01-06 18:57:20] <%RedShadowHTX> @GhostStylez a general rule of thumb I have seen frequently in FPS is adjusting your sens where you can start at one side of your mousepad and make a 360 with your character to the other side. Then you can finely tune from there. If you are over shooting lower sens under shooting up it etc.
[2023-01-06 18:57:45] VIEWERS: 890
[2023-01-06 18:58:23] <%RedShadowHTX> @GhostStylez also there are many websites that have sens converters so you can carry your muscle memory over to other games. Final Note STICK WITH IT don't constantly change it lol
[2023-01-06 18:58:24] <+regularlyunderperforming> @GhostStylez rulew of thumb is you dont want it in a way that when you move the mouse the max distance you dont do mroe then 180¬∞ - having to move more for little ingame distance means easier staying on target
[2023-01-06 18:59:28] <%+GhostStylez> @RedShadowHTX Never heard of that. Interesting way to adjust it. I will do some research in the firing range.
