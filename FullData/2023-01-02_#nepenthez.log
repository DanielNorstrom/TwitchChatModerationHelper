[2023-01-02 14:22:21] <%+rpc84> Charlie Austin back at Swindon is a good shout

[2023-01-02 14:24:19] <@sorarejosh> the one guy i dream of is tadic, hes just so consistent
[2023-01-02 14:24:20] <stef11ihv2303> Yes he is most likely to go ligue 1 after this season
[2023-01-02 14:24:24] <stef11ihv2303> Zerrouki
[2023-01-02 14:24:31] <%robo_cfc> Wass is a beast
[2023-01-02 14:24:32] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> some proper deals tobe had in Liga Mx too
[2023-01-02 14:24:55] <ckgk01> Have you looked at Diallo at Sunderland?
[2023-01-02 14:24:57] <stef11ihv2303> Blind is most likely to go to antwerp fc
[2023-01-02 14:24:59] <theholypriest1> yo
[2023-01-02 14:25:00] <+PokeHooks> what if he retires lol
[2023-01-02 14:25:02] <@%Witchwalker70> I need some more rare forwards. i'm a bit light in that area
[2023-01-02 14:25:04] <majy786> i need to buy a midfielder for 15 pounds do you recomend anyone
[2023-01-02 14:25:11] <%Sammystaa> What's up nep? How we doing
[2023-01-02 14:25:20] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Maybe with his heart conditions?
[2023-01-02 14:25:22] <+Jamie602> blind in the mls would be mad
[2023-01-02 14:25:26] <%+jsh66> Blind has that heart thing right?
[2023-01-02 14:25:27] <jafar1094> There are rumours he might go to antwerp
[2023-01-02 14:25:27] <jimjones9> i read galatasaray are looking into blind @nepenthez
[2023-01-02 14:25:38] <FoxInTheBoxFM> wherever he goes, he's first 11
[2023-01-02 14:25:40] <%robo_cfc> he suits the scoring matrix so well
[2023-01-02 14:25:45] <RyanWalters21> If a player retires nep is the card worthless ?
[2023-01-02 14:25:46] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Have you seen the price of DNP Rare keepers since the update?
[2023-01-02 14:25:47] <+gooner78mcd> Mudryk personal terms agreed with arsenal just negotiating price hope we get him in time for spurs game and he can make himself an instant hero by scoring
[2023-01-02 14:25:48] <%+davidg1993> is ETH grind still worth?
[2023-01-02 14:25:48] <+kingjames13bosca> In my opinion Chiesa will have a big return from his injury
[2023-01-02 14:25:50] <%blazer33x> hi
[2023-01-02 14:25:51] <%+mikekozy23> do you usually bid or just buy manage sales?

[2023-01-02 14:26:09] <@sorarejosh> gignac is one i was looking at, i like how he plays every game even at 36
[2023-01-02 14:26:09] <%FUTDAN26> Still got gustavo bou?
[2023-01-02 14:26:12] <%+Bigrossco92> Hey nep do you have an affiliate with SorareData? If so what‚Äôs the code?
[2023-01-02 14:26:17] <stef11ihv2303> I just fell in love with tresor , he made me watch every game of genk
[2023-01-02 14:26:23] <+keytvzee> Im not sure of this scoring system. I had a player at 71 points and 1 day later his points have dropped to 62.. why are they changing it. It‚Äôs the difference of one tier for me

[2023-01-02 14:27:19] <jackobe> Why is pope not getting the uppgrade?
[2023-01-02 14:27:25] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The price of DNP keepers is so low, I do think theres a possibility that DNP keeper with 4 bangers in threshold could end up being really good.

[2023-01-02 15:08:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I really feel like a lot of seasons are going to be set up in the next 3 games. United could be title contenders or could be struggling for europe. City could be top, or could be out of top 4. Arsenal could be 10+ points clear, or could see their lead completely demolished. Chelsea could be on a CL charge or could be Potterless and midtable. Newcastle could be in the mix or be considered to be falling off. And all of them are possible and not beyond the realms of realism.

[2023-01-02 15:09:04] <@%$ItsTr3ple> You've got this guy's number going forward
[2023-01-02 15:09:05] <Yronimuss> Chat I have a lot of packs should I save them for toty or open them when a good promo is there?
[2023-01-02 15:09:33] <dizzydukc> Ai
[2023-01-02 15:09:33] <Vanclef> Should I do my icon player pick sbc?
[2023-01-02 15:09:35] <%+mikekozy23> what a save
[2023-01-02 15:09:43] <MattXBro> Hi
[2023-01-02 15:09:58] <here4rewards_> @SpreadsheetFifa if United were sold already and we had new owners, we would be getting Felix and an Enzo in Jan, could've been a push for the title but can't see it happening now with the Glazers selling and not wanting to spend.
[2023-01-02 15:10:01] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa 100%. Spurs too could really only expect 1-3 points from their next 3 as well. Honestly dont think weve ever had 3 games with so much on the line for so many teams. Palace are going to be the big decider too
[2023-01-02 15:10:02] <lior636> @therealdraigo yea I follow him and check his twitter daily but just wanted to check if anyone else started leaking :)
[2023-01-02 15:10:13] <sterudd123> Arsenal have made an improved offer for mudryk according to fab

[2023-01-02 15:10:40] <%therealdraigo> I got ww sancho from this promo and he is a stud . Very solid
[2023-01-02 15:10:41] <dehinbo7> What‚Äôs the new speed run gonna be?
[2023-01-02 15:10:48] <%+Apple22> Arsenal have now made a second bid for Mykhaylo Mudryk. Told the total package remains under ‚Ç¨70m
[2023-01-02 15:10:59] <lior636> @therealdraigo got him from a 75+ pick
[2023-01-02 15:10:59] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa Think Felix would be enough if no real injuries occur in the midfield. But agreed, a big Jan and United could get themselves amongst it
[2023-01-02 15:11:01] <@%$ItsTr3ple> @MattXBro Probably using a banned term
[2023-01-02 15:11:27] <%therealdraigo> I think Felix is overrated

[2023-01-02 15:19:10] <here4rewards_> player lock maybe
[2023-01-02 15:19:15] <amosp21296> the problem with fifa is that u dont have 100% control so tgeres not any best thing its depands on AI decisons
[2023-01-02 15:19:15] <@%Viperlization> player lock baits
[2023-01-02 15:19:17] <%+Golderlight123> tell your players to come closer
[2023-01-02 15:19:21] <@%Viperlization> opens the spacer
[2023-01-02 15:19:21] <%$oclarkk> it would help if the attacking ai wasnt idiotic
[2023-01-02 15:19:22] <MrBromego> Best decision I've made in fifa was to stop playing rivals (sweaty I mean) been down in div 6 now and friendly objectives are easy, honestly skill based match making ruins objectives
[2023-01-02 15:19:29] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I banned a guy yesterday, he had only said "music is trash". But hed had a history of bans and timeouts including sectarian abuse. He decided, the best way to fix that was abuse me on twitter spread21Smart
[2023-01-02 15:19:29] <Vanclef> But that situation depends on the tactics u use
[2023-01-02 15:19:33] <%+Apple22> travelas, thats what everyone else does LuL
[2023-01-02 15:19:34] <Kaizorblue> or press l1 to someone on a run that baits them to
[2023-01-02 15:19:37] <dizzydukc> thats real footbAll actually if yoy look at UCL finals it was the same
[2023-01-02 15:19:42] <+21irst> wing play is key nep, opens up the entire game
[2023-01-02 15:19:44] <@%Viperlization> also, full backs on attacking helps
[2023-01-02 15:19:47] <@%Viperlization> extra option
[2023-01-02 15:19:49] <AaronRamsayFIFA> pass between the 2 cm's a cb will not track an ST movement at some point. pass into the st step over away and shoot
[2023-01-02 15:19:55] <%$coys51> @SpreadsheetFifa some sad people about mate

[2023-01-02 15:24:55] <@%Viperlization> its so funny that everyone avoids rivals nowadays
[2023-01-02 15:24:55] <sonaldo1237> Will the speed run still be 4 hours of grinding before champs?
[2023-01-02 15:25:02] <tavvsen> im in elite and its very frustrating to be able to play only 4 in the friendly mode when every game is  vs full sweat
[2023-01-02 15:25:02] <+alphvgam3r> quitting dont count the game to the milestone tho!

[2023-01-02 15:51:36] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I really feel like a lot of seasons are going to be set up in the next 3 games. United could be title contenders or could be struggling for europe. City could be top, or could be out of top 4. Arsenal could be 10+ points clear, or could see their lead completely demolished. Chelsea could be on a CL charge or could be Potterless and midtable. Newcastle could be in the mix or be considered to be falling off. And all of them are possible and not beyond the realms of realism.

[2023-01-02 15:58:44] <tiensbetroen> ah I see
[2023-01-02 15:58:46] <jonty__8> its hard to see arsenal loosing, especially due to city's struggles to get 3 points

[2023-01-02 15:58:55] <%+emohendry> Newcastle 95-95?
[2023-01-02 15:58:57] <%+cwils_rtg> I feel both united and Arsenal a cm and a goalscorer they could cause a serious threat
[2023-01-02 15:59:02] <%suraj672004> city needed to win everton. everton were great defensively
[2023-01-02 15:59:02] <%DodzRD> City will still drop points though they look very shakey in defence. When the get pressed they struggle
[2023-01-02 15:59:03] <smithzaa> you must feel good about arsenal this season Craig surely ?
[2023-01-02 15:59:06] <%+dangraham69> Didn‚Äôt Newcastle or were they not that far ahead?
[2023-01-02 15:59:07] <%+kingnovakin> props to arsenal for putting up a title race, I predicted city to be running away with it
[2023-01-02 15:59:11] <yo_pieerree> Most of those teams didn‚Äôt face this city
[2023-01-02 15:59:16] <Michael654> will you do something crazy if they win the league?
[2023-01-02 15:59:22] <+xextremedarknessx> you think arsenal will sign someone to cover Jesus
[2023-01-02 15:59:24] <000skeletor000> lowest points total to win a Premier League in the last six years is 86. You normally need in the 90's though. Title race far from over
[2023-01-02 15:59:27] <AHaZee> Anyone doing BPM on PC and is it as effective?
[2023-01-02 15:59:30] <%+rickd96> time for a change ;) tbf would be nice if Arsenal wins it after so many years and a nice squad
[2023-01-02 15:59:31] <+rahulk1988> We got a hard few games coming up, if we still top at end of feb then it‚Äôs ours üí™üèΩ

[2023-01-02 16:00:00] <@sorarejosh> this yr is giving me them Leicester winning yr vibes, so many big teams having a tough season
[2023-01-02 16:00:14] <garritosdorritos> @ahazee exactly the same, market is cross play
[2023-01-02 16:00:14] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> United keep coming up against teams with a new manager at home, so tough
[2023-01-02 16:00:18] <%+MackTominay> My Club

[2023-01-02 16:00:25] <%+cwils_rtg> United have the right run of games now while everyone else dropped points bar arseanl where seriously going under the raidar atm
[2023-01-02 16:00:25] <+CretinT> as a chelsea fan, everyone should be looking to beat us since potter took over
[2023-01-02 16:00:30] <%suraj672004> everton were solid in defense. btw gray goal of the season?
[2023-01-02 16:00:34] <%+MlKE_2023> United haven‚Äôt conceded a goal all season when varane and Casemiro have both been on the bench
[2023-01-02 16:00:36] VIEWERS: 1¬†834
[2023-01-02 16:00:38] <humza_c> united vs Bournemouth is crucial we have to win
[2023-01-02 16:00:41] <xYounes97> the final top 4 might actually be as is now
[2023-01-02 16:00:42] <%DodzRD> spurs have zero creativity
[2023-01-02 16:00:47] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The thing is, check the games for the top 6 plus chelsea and all of them have a horrendous run
[2023-01-02 16:00:47] <%+hiimsausageman> liverpool win the league if they sign a midfielder
[2023-01-02 16:00:48] <jcjc1jc> Liverpool are actually doing good. They‚Äôre not out of looks yet
[2023-01-02 16:00:49] <%$istreet98> ten Hag has a 71% win rate

[2023-01-02 16:00:58] <%+jacktwoodard00> @nepenthez u think West Ham will turn it around bro
[2023-01-02 16:01:00] <%suraj672004> gray goal was insane. infornt of everton fans aswell
[2023-01-02 16:01:05] <%+brendanmcd8> liverpools strikers can
[2023-01-02 16:01:05] <%+samrobinsonboi> Arsenal City Utd Liverpool for top 4 i think
[2023-01-02 16:01:06] <flossbay2015> hi
[2023-01-02 16:01:07] <+xextremedarknessx> Newcastle to fall off
[2023-01-02 16:01:10] <+CretinT> @Cookie3400 agreed, worst decision made in decades
[2023-01-02 16:01:12] <flossbay2015> gimme shootout
[2023-01-02 16:01:12] <%+Pughy30> I'd love to see Newcastle get top 4 just to see the madness they do in the summer transfer window
[2023-01-02 16:01:14] <%+brendanmcd8> liverpools strikers cant hit the broadside of a barn right now
[2023-01-02 16:01:15] <+alphvgam3r> chelsea is awful after Tuchel
[2023-01-02 16:01:16] <Bazatelli> @samrobinsonboi yEAH
[2023-01-02 16:01:17] <%johnfive21> Chelsea on 20 goals is tragic
[2023-01-02 16:01:19] <+WinterGaming96> As a Southampton fan this is the first season where in bricking it üòÇ we where literally top of the league this time last year‚Ä¶
[2023-01-02 16:01:20] <jdheart402> Liverpool is taking a top 4 spot idc who‚Äôs spot they‚Äôre taking but they‚Äôre taking one
[2023-01-02 16:01:35] <%+MackTominay> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, Liverpool in the europa league just will not happen
[2023-01-02 16:01:38] <%+Jason_DDA> Gakpo could take them to top 4
[2023-01-02 16:01:38] <+will15k> i think itll be arsenal , city newcastle liverpool united spurs
[2023-01-02 16:01:39] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> United conceded 10 of their 20 goals in 2 games
[2023-01-02 16:01:40] <bigboybarrybrown69> I agree with Newcastle taking 5th, still a great season
[2023-01-02 16:01:41] <%H0NKTV> yeah I'm a newcastle fan and I agree, i think we will finish top 8 but the momemtum will slow down soon
[2023-01-02 16:01:41] <%+dangraham69> Chelsea nearly 20 points behind already
[2023-01-02 16:01:45] <sonaldo1237> Haaland with more goals than Chelsea
[2023-01-02 16:01:49] <%suraj672004> liverpool looked shaky against leicester and villa
[2023-01-02 16:01:50] <lukejplackett> Chelsea were so poor yesterday
[2023-01-02 16:01:53] <Glacier_b> Lack of squad depth might kill us (Utd)
[2023-01-02 16:01:59] <AHaZee> Chelsea to drop the bag in January tho
[2023-01-02 16:02:09] <TheGreenePotato> im a United fan, I'll be surprised if we get top 4
[2023-01-02 16:02:13] <Michael654> United's GD is tragic too
[2023-01-02 16:02:14] <%+dillon634> Would like to see Newcastle get top 4 cant see it happening though
[2023-01-02 16:02:15] <+alphvgam3r> they should have never let Tuchel go what a bad diction
[2023-01-02 16:02:17] <%+rickd96> as long as you're no city or liverpool, 3rd is best possible. Arnsenal beating all expectations
[2023-01-02 16:02:17] <+xextremedarknessx> do you think arsenal will sign a striker to cover injury to Jesus
[2023-01-02 16:02:25] <%DodzRD> People saying chelsea need a goal scorer but if dont create chances we still wont score.
[2023-01-02 16:02:33] <m_sk> what do u think a successful season would be for newcastle neppo?
[2023-01-02 16:02:36] <%$oclarkk> @Michael654 its getting alot better start of the season and city game fucked us

[2023-01-02 16:03:10] <%+cwils_rtg> @Glacier_b i feel it could kill us but seeing how flexible the backline has bvecome and the decent players in midfield the front line could kill us

[2023-01-02 16:03:37] <+xextremedarknessx> arsenal need to sign a striker to cover jesus for injuries
[2023-01-02 16:03:37] <+matt_mcg_27> Most impressive thing about arsenal this season is that in 16 games maybe 3 halfs of football we have looked shaky other than them we have dominated

[2023-01-02 16:04:06] <supermercadotelebancos> The one thing. Arsenal always have a dreadful month. They need to hope they avoid that month @nepenthez

[2023-01-02 16:04:07] <%+alex_lad420> personally think newcastle will hit a slump potentially from now and then liverpool enter top 4

[2023-01-02 16:04:13] <zaraankhan200> liverpool won't give up, and also city won't, also u lot have hard games now, so if lost 2 or 3 more then ur out the title race tbh that my opinion

[2023-01-02 16:05:03] <here4rewards_> Arsenal need a RB who is comfortable playing inverted

[2023-01-02 16:05:45] <+grumpiestbunny> Every team needs that player that maybe does not get recgonised but plays a key role. Maybe not the most glamorious player but he is key to the way arsenal play
[2023-01-02 16:05:48] <+xextremedarknessx> striker is a must

[2023-01-02 16:05:57] <supermercadotelebancos> Also the way Arsenal plays is impressive. And when the opponent scores, they score immediately back. The only performance that was disappointing was the final 30 mins on old Trafford. They lost at least 2 points there.

[2023-01-02 16:37:41] <Rickz1999> i think yours will do very good because a lot of people including me are strugling with the league sbc, not the premium one, and this will help them a lot
[2023-01-02 16:37:45] <jamie_bv123> too much supply, make it more rare anmd its higher demand

[2023-01-02 16:37:48] <%+chemicallocust> I haven't seen the vids, but I think just changing the number of days may have been his problem. You're doing it with specific things in the game, which IMO is more appealing.

[2023-01-02 17:29:01] <+Metcalfe11> i would say for content as viewer it loses relatability on PC when the market and values of stuff is so different to what most play on. if that makes sense
[2023-01-02 17:29:01] <here4rewards_> back when there were top 100 leaderboards PC was like around 24/30 wins to get into it.

[2023-01-02 17:29:33] <$Mythirteen> that graphics stuff that makes new gen play diffrent can be turned off on the settings ingame im not 100% sure. what i am sure is that my game on pc plays much different thatn new gen. its much smoother

[2023-01-02 17:29:57] <%+ReazMimic> It has to be true because the pros HAVE to play on PS5 right?

[2023-01-02 17:30:43] <%+cj_thedj> yeah but that makes the rug unrealistic because most viewers are on console
[2023-01-02 17:30:45] <logankerr96> Less players on PC too, so you‚Äôre more likely to match up with those top class players each time I guess
[2023-01-02 17:30:45] <%+ColeTrain3> can you do a line for average console players so I know where im at LUL

[2023-01-02 17:32:43] <%Sbradley08> Only big issue with PC FIFA is that is very badly optimised. Runs like a one-legged donkey in a mudbath.

[2023-01-02 18:04:48] <here4rewards_> Arsenal should have been prioritizing Gakpo
[2023-01-02 18:04:54] <%m3elv1n> but mudryk is simping for arsenal atm
[2023-01-02 18:04:57] <+mensgold> We don‚Äôt have his type in our team . He progress the ball well . But the price is too much
[2023-01-02 18:04:58] <+Jamie602> ive been scared by pepe comps on youtube, thought he was going to be the best thing since sliced bread
[2023-01-02 18:04:59] <$Mythirteen> kvaradone is 10 times better than mudrik
[2023-01-02 18:05:04] <lordxxchiefer> Is that tonali worth it neppo
[2023-01-02 18:05:09] <%+kingnovakin> @Witchwalker70 true, hope brereton Diaz can keep firing. wouldn't mind him at Leeds. he would prob stay at yours if you go up too

[2023-01-02 18:05:40] <+popfunkoguy64> @sorarejosh Sorare is everything mate

[2023-01-02 18:05:46] <JammieDodge191> I have faith in the talent Id and scouting by the management nowadays
[2023-01-02 18:05:47] <ZTC7> Benjamin Sesko > Mudryk
[2023-01-02 18:05:47] <here4rewards_> Lisandro Martinez for example
[2023-01-02 18:05:51] <+jrossino> It‚Äôs funny when they ask him if he would go to arsenal like little guy even deserves it

[2023-01-02 18:06:17] <%+maxsmith16_> he scored in the other game against celtic
[2023-01-02 18:06:21] <nugolopessss> mudryk is a baller
[2023-01-02 18:06:22] <%chrisdepot> Might be cover for the wing and gives Marquinhos a chance to go on loan
[2023-01-02 18:06:28] <%+rparr94> i was going to say look at martinelli he came out of nowhere and is the best lw in the league, the reason why we judge is because of price tags however if the clubs willing to pay its unfair to the player for the pressure to be added

[2023-01-02 18:06:57] <@%Witchwalker70> @kingnovakin True, and if Venkys don't want to sell someone, no amount of money will change their minds so I'm hoping this is how they feels about BBD
[2023-01-02 18:06:57] <%+bneto10> Like Martinelli in lower Brazilian division, but tearing it up at Arsenal. He's the exception tho

[2023-01-02 18:08:00] <Rickz1999> ¬¥felix would be the best thing for arsenal tbh

[2023-01-02 18:14:44] <@%Viperlization> loooool
[2023-01-02 18:14:45] <yungmaseyy> Basically if you want to ruin your footballing career; Go to Man United
[2023-01-02 18:14:49] <@%Viperlization> that man is a freak
[2023-01-02 18:14:51] <%FUTDAN26> There was a game where he only had like 13 touches but still scored one or two
[2023-01-02 18:14:56] <%+damien84gamerboy> i think halland made city worse as a team :D
[2023-01-02 18:14:59] <@%Viperlization> can he break the records?
[2023-01-02 18:15:00] <tribeace99> how is mbappe compared to haaland on sorare?
[2023-01-02 18:15:03] <JeicoN_TK> And he is only 22 years old
[2023-01-02 18:15:06] <Post_FUT_Clarity> Josh I predict Mbemba masterclass at 6pm

[2023-01-02 18:15:19] <here4rewards_> Never forget United nearly signed Haaland and Bellingham in 1 window.
[2023-01-02 18:15:21] <Jacob___Lodge> However you could argue that Haaland makes City worse
[2023-01-02 18:15:21] VIEWERS: 2¬†014

[2023-01-02 18:15:28] <FoxInTheBoxFM> there is no type of goal he can't score

[2023-01-02 18:15:44] <%m3elv1n> ole learned him everything Kappa
[2023-01-02 18:15:48] <%exclusive457> when you watch haaland he looks like a veteran striker and hes 22, its just ridiculous
[2023-01-02 18:15:49] <$Mythirteen> mbappe has 18 assists and like 30 goals its insane aswell
[2023-01-02 18:15:49] <Crvwned> I feel like hes an ibra but very much primed and seasoned cause his height
[2023-01-02 18:15:51] <dontlivethen> he's a boy mentally but physically he's OLD
[2023-01-02 18:15:55] <%+anakinnoobwalker> what about mbappe?
[2023-01-02 18:15:56] <%+damien84gamerboy> why are city on less points with halland then
[2023-01-02 18:15:59] <Crvwned> Hes a baller
[2023-01-02 18:15:59] <Rickz1999> the problem with haaland and mbappe is that i dont hink thay they will be top level as much time as ronaldo and messi were
[2023-01-02 18:16:00] <here4rewards_> he came straight out the science lab at 6ft 4
[2023-01-02 18:16:00] <%+rpc84> I don't mean it in a bad way but he is a freak on a football pitch
[2023-01-02 18:16:03] <sterudd123> Wtf man ahaha
[2023-01-02 18:16:06] <%+fistyanan> @damien84gamerboy thats a dumb take
[2023-01-02 18:16:20] <+1predz> 50 goals on average a season?
[2023-01-02 18:16:20] <dilplays> still going to lose the league to arsenal COYG
[2023-01-02 18:16:21] <willshire232323> Will he outscore Ronaldo though?
[2023-01-02 18:16:23] <%FUTDAN26> Imagine haaland taking over from Kane for England
[2023-01-02 18:16:23] <%+shaqhinds03> Ligue 1 LUL
[2023-01-02 18:16:28] <%jordan97jw> mbappe has been at a dominant team the entire time as well

[2023-01-02 18:16:30] <%+placidjack> Konate is BACK baby
[2023-01-02 18:16:31] <Michael654> Mbappe is more complete imo
[2023-01-02 18:16:34] <%m3elv1n> but mbappe gets assists
[2023-01-02 18:16:36] <%$GeorgeSlade_> he wont need to
[2023-01-02 18:16:37] <Da_kapo> That Mbappe Monaco team was so good
[2023-01-02 18:16:41] <%+MackTominay> Haaland really does have the N/A body type
[2023-01-02 18:16:42] <themillkybarkid> his size will be a big setback for him in the future with big injury problems
[2023-01-02 18:16:46] <dontlivethen> @rickz1999 for sure. that's why Messi and Ronaldo will be huge in history
[2023-01-02 18:16:52] <Crvwned> hes going to break prem record this year
[2023-01-02 18:16:53] <campcrystal> Course he will.
[2023-01-02 18:16:55] <$fawzi158> other than international football i agree
[2023-01-02 18:16:57] <+Hudd_giants> Haaland saying his fav player is ibra makes so much sense lmao
[2023-01-02 18:17:00] <%+callumalc7> what about world cup?
[2023-01-02 18:17:01] <dini6> if he wasnt norwegian

[2023-01-02 18:17:29] <sterudd123> I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll score 91 goals in a career year
[2023-01-02 18:17:31] <%+anakinnoobwalker> why do fifa do him dirty on dribbling?
[2023-01-02 18:17:35] <skillz166477> ronaldo 118 i think
[2023-01-02 18:17:36] <r6pengo> its been a while since a big career ending injury to a big name i have a feeling it will happen soon
[2023-01-02 18:17:39] <$fawzi158> yeah but norway dont play as many games as the other country's
[2023-01-02 18:17:39] <%+placidjack> If he can stay fit

[2023-01-02 18:17:53] <+euiess> But the amount of assist messi had that season let‚Äôs not forget that
[2023-01-02 18:17:53] <%exclusive457> ronaldos on 119 isnt he, could be wrong
[2023-01-02 18:17:55] <%+maxsmith16_> because its norway he wont play many international tournaments
[2023-01-02 18:17:55] <%$Macenzi1> If he moves to Real Madrid or Barca he would break the records in 3 years lol
[2023-01-02 18:17:59] <+Jamie602> maybe if norway weren't dog water
[2023-01-02 18:17:59] <+josh__m19> he will get to tournaments from now on tbf, extra teams introduced plus Norway's talent coming through
[2023-01-02 18:18:00] <+emilinho_96> norway overall is shit at international games LUL
[2023-01-02 18:18:01] <+callumheys96> Easily üòÇ

[2023-01-02 18:18:25] <%+MlKE_2023> He will move to real I think in a couple of years
[2023-01-02 18:18:25] <%exclusive457> haaland needs to come to Arsenal, then he would be insane
[2023-01-02 18:18:28] <1Smoked> bayern aint got the wage for him

[2023-01-02 18:18:31] <%$GeorgeSlade_> u basically have to be at a int. tournement and get far in all domestic comps to get 91 in a year
[2023-01-02 18:18:33] <moistylad> but he's playing for norway not germany or someone who scores 5 in every international friendly and double the games norway play
[2023-01-02 18:18:33] <%+whale_b1ologist> If he wants to win trophies he needs to come to Arsenal tbf
[2023-01-02 18:18:34] <+samm_786> I think he‚Äôll be at city for a long time
[2023-01-02 18:18:35] <onlysebz> dont think people realise how difficult it would be to score 91 goals in a year lol

[2023-01-02 18:20:46] <andrew_maggipint0> I think pep feels like he needs to play grealish because of the price tag. has to justify it

[2023-01-02 18:22:12] <%+juni0rtc74> "finding form" - "need confidence" - "it'll come", we heard the same things about Timo and aslo Torres when he was at Chelsea. We ultimately just dont know
[2023-01-02 18:22:18] <%+callumalc7> nunez is similar to werner. if he stops missing chances he'll be on fire
[2023-01-02 18:22:19] <+brianmcgee99> @jrossino how many did he score last season?
[2023-01-02 18:22:22] <stephenhare123> just won a fut draft with my no-one in my defence being over 6ft LUL
[2023-01-02 18:22:24] <+seanranson1> Is Bruno Guimaraes good on sorare?
[2023-01-02 18:22:26] <$Mythirteen> Nunez had the same problem at Benfica in the first season, he needs to be handled carefully but once he gets his confidence he doesnt stop scoring trust
[2023-01-02 18:22:27] <adwes13> Werner did the same as Nunez but got slaughtered
[2023-01-02 18:22:31] <zipcan> Gakpo going to take minutes from Nunez?
[2023-01-02 18:22:36] <yungmaseyy> Werner couldn‚Äôt lace Darwin‚Äôs boots
[2023-01-02 18:22:43] <tsmithy65> I love how much people hate on timo , honestly use to create so much
[2023-01-02 18:22:47] <+emilinho_96> @callumalc7 true
[2023-01-02 18:22:52] <addhyany12> same for timo, no?
[2023-01-02 18:22:53] <%+3omar_astro> werner was just awful at chelsea
[2023-01-02 18:22:54] <willshire232323> Nunez just needs to keep mentally strong and not let the missed chances affect him
[2023-01-02 18:23:00] <r6pengo> hes hit the woodwork the most this season
[2023-01-02 18:23:04] <+josh__m19> alot of Nunez' big chances start with him on the ball at halfway line, which is nuts
[2023-01-02 18:23:06] <%$GeorgeSlade_> werner was never this good and nunez isnt even at full capacity
[2023-01-02 18:23:06] <+jrossino> He doesn‚Äôt choose the right shot type
[2023-01-02 18:23:07] <Jbunnerz> That second goal v Leicester was purely due to him
[2023-01-02 18:23:07] <%+callumalc7> werner was doing the same
[2023-01-02 18:23:11] <Rickz1999> nep, your toughts on palhinha?

[2023-01-02 18:23:14] <campcrystal> All that tells you is that he lacks composure.
[2023-01-02 18:23:15] <%Sbradley08> Nunez needs time to get used to the pace of the EPL, just like Pires and Vidic did.
[2023-01-02 18:23:17] <+samrobinsonboi> he scores 2 tonight imo
[2023-01-02 18:23:17] <+Jamie602> nunez is out when salah gakpo and diaz are fit, id have jota ahead of him too
[2023-01-02 18:23:19] <sterudd123> The moment his confidence is back he is going to be absolutely insane
[2023-01-02 18:23:20] <+M4N5F1ELD_> Darwin has elite movement its fun to banta Liverpool fans but once he settles he's going to bang

[2023-01-02 18:23:45] <%+Metcalfe11> Werner chased and hurried everything tho which helped the team create isk
[2023-01-02 18:23:45] <willshire232323> Greedy though
[2023-01-02 18:23:46] <Richm1996> Werner would've bag a ton if he and his team mates could break the offside trap. I hate Chelsea but Timo is a goalscorer

[2023-01-02 18:24:01] <UpTheNorway> LUL
[2023-01-02 18:24:12] <tsmithy65> Timo Werner use to create loads , the run he made in the champions league final to create the space for havertz to run into is underrated
[2023-01-02 18:24:14] <willshire232323> He takes on chances when he should pass
[2023-01-02 18:24:14] <+Jamie602> hes a pace merchant, no composure
[2023-01-02 18:24:18] <%+bazzay10> I think sometimes  mbappe is too quick for his own good in certain situations
[2023-01-02 18:24:20] <+man_mothz> Gakpo will replace the uraguian Carrol
[2023-01-02 18:24:23] <kevkenna> Werner would have banged in that Liverpool team
[2023-01-02 18:24:30] <Richm1996> because Nunez is always offside it's no different to werner other than he's more powerful
[2023-01-02 18:24:31] <+brianmcgee99> Hes in his peak form this year
[2023-01-02 18:24:35] <%m3elv1n> mbappe has perfected the near post finish

[2023-01-02 18:25:14] <%m3elv1n> and nunez hasnt given up he keeps on going
[2023-01-02 18:25:16] <nelly__96> Wener was faster than Nunez???

[2023-01-02 18:25:27] <willshire232323> A big chance should be an open goal. No chance should be big if there‚Äôs a pro keeper in goal
[2023-01-02 18:25:30] <+brianmcgee99> @Cheetoo13 probably a good way to get into it then.
[2023-01-02 18:25:36] <ZTC7> Nunez reminds me of Suarez at Liverpool without the finishing
[2023-01-02 18:25:38] <%+callumalc7> yeah its no

[2023-01-02 18:25:51] <%+callumalc7> yeah some of them just arent big chances
[2023-01-02 18:25:56] <Michael654> if my dad is shouting at you for missing its a big chance
[2023-01-02 18:26:01] <tsmithy65> Timo could create space tho , he was very good at drawing defenders out of the ball , he created space for havertz in the champions league final
[2023-01-02 18:26:02] <@%Witchwalker70> They constantly score bcm wrong. it's very infuriating
[2023-01-02 18:26:03] <$Cheetoo13> @brianmcgee99 Yeh i think too but the others are normally very cheap

[2023-01-02 18:53:48] <Post_FUT_Clarity> @dangoodwin1 there's probably more worth in cards in his account than 3 mil
[2023-01-02 18:53:56] <%+ray_rockwood> my question is what is Sorare doing with your Ethereum that is on their platform? Are they staking it or loaning it out and earning interest on it?
[2023-01-02 18:53:58] <wizkid_205> If he has already made more than he put in he will never lose money
[2023-01-02 18:54:10] <@sorarejosh> Yeah remember Reynolds deal I got off him
[2023-01-02 18:54:23] <+euiess> Could easy got an 1100¬£ for him
[2023-01-02 18:54:25] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> ian maatsen is a good pickup. about ¬£30 for a future chelsea player whos just this week got 92 points as a defender at 20 years old
[2023-01-02 18:54:41] <+josephp794_> what is this
[2023-01-02 18:54:45] <@sorarejosh> Yeah because surely if he‚Äôs collecting rwds for Blackpool , they‚Äôd want him to eek out every penny
[2023-01-02 18:54:45] <notjerryhernandez> whats new in fifa
[2023-01-02 18:54:45] <FoxInTheBoxFM> he's generally good to deal with if you're in the sorare circle

[2023-01-02 18:55:29] <@sorarejosh> Think another issue is a lot of the whales are selling their football rwds to invest into NBA , rather than reinvesting back into footie , as their teams are all but set
[2023-01-02 18:55:32] <Post_FUT_Clarity> is he what you would consider a whale

[2023-01-02 19:08:05] <+pierrecr704> you would just do the if sbc for 10k
[2023-01-02 19:08:16] <keith_mercer89> Why does EA switch between 81 to 78 in upgrades.  Just keep it with 81 upgrades
[2023-01-02 19:08:22] <@%Viperlization> passing is so bad on him
[2023-01-02 19:08:23] <+grimmers88> Compared to Clauss who was free, it's very poor
[2023-01-02 19:08:23] <Ad_aamm> How are IF's expensive when there's literally a TOTW upgrade SBC
[2023-01-02 19:08:25] <@%Viperlization> for a full back
[2023-01-02 19:08:26] <%+maxsmith16_> theres the totw upgrade
[2023-01-02 19:08:26] <meestarii> Just get IF From the IF Upgrade pack and get to freerol the 1% chance to hit something good
[2023-01-02 19:08:35] <%+miguelk79> they should of made Kenny 5 star weak foot

[2023-01-02 19:08:44] <%$wantsomechickenlad22> @viperlization how much is the 81+ totw sbc? if it‚Äôs cheap then that‚Äôs decent

[2023-01-02 19:09:12] <%+mikekozy23> that would be like 12k on the market
[2023-01-02 19:09:14] <$LilFishFart> He would be discard tbh

[2023-01-02 19:09:33] <Jbunnerz> no more than fabio
[2023-01-02 19:09:34] <%+benhowe13> compare to amarvi

[2023-01-02 19:10:30] <HashMaan123> The reason sbc cards are more expensive because EA know that you have fodda in your club already and most people won‚Äôt spend fodda on the card so if you want to do it you would just do it. Then your fodda will be used

[2023-01-02 19:33:53] <%Dezalleycat> I agree here,the most popular concept of production is what people can‚Äôt achieve themselves,I think that‚Äôs why gambling streams do so well,people can stack packs for TOTY now so a pack opening will not be as enticing to people as it was in FIFA 17-20

[2023-01-02 19:37:28] <%+threefatslugs> On the VODs on YouTube point, YouTube is a far nicer environment to watch videos on - the Twitch player is really poor. Also, there‚Äôs a HUGE amount of great long form content you put out while streaming that doesn‚Äôt make the cut in the YouTube video which would be great to catch on YouTube (and perhaps a big chunk of your viewer base might be missing out on?) Just my 2 cents though!

[2023-01-02 20:02:54] <satvikkkk> i love hearing creators talk about backend stuff even though i aint a creator myself LUL
[2023-01-02 20:02:54] <%+stackmillz> i want to see a 24 hr stream rtg where u run 8hrs then josh takes over for 8hrs then viper takes over for 8hrs all on the same acount it would b insane to see what the end result would b especially if it was like a friday or sat when u can do champs
[2023-01-02 20:02:58] <@%Viperlization> the 4 hr is very evergreen
[2023-01-02 20:03:08] <@%Viperlization> Where do you expect that to be in a month?
[2023-01-02 20:03:09] <+philipio1> So you think you will do any IRL streams when Fifa 23 dies (if it hasn‚Äôt already!)
[2023-01-02 20:03:20] <+tundebayode> @Viperlization talking hustle and grind scratches an itch not many convos do
[2023-01-02 20:03:22] <@%Viperlization> I'd say, 300, 400k
[2023-01-02 20:03:31] <@%Viperlization> spot on josh
[2023-01-02 20:03:34] <h4nit> You know that Alaba was it a sbc ?
[2023-01-02 20:03:35] <@%Viperlization> changing the thumb soon on that
[2023-01-02 20:03:43] <@%Viperlization> changing it per promo is a good idea
[2023-01-02 20:03:52] <%+always_rainy98> could even do a 4hr in a month or two as a big element of the first one was world cup swaps - would be interesting to see how it can be achieved without

[2023-01-02 20:04:13] <%+maxsmith16_> maybe some irl videos nep maybe go to an arsenal game?
[2023-01-02 20:04:16] <satvikkkk> i wonder how EA Sports 24 is going to do as a name in a youtube title. i guess calling it FIFA 24 will be better due to length and recognizability xqcT
[2023-01-02 20:04:19] <@%Viperlization> yeah exactly
[2023-01-02 20:04:22] <%+threefatslugs> I guess evergreen content is tough with cyclical game releases, and especially game like FIFA where the content in each game changes so frequently
[2023-01-02 20:04:27] <@%Viperlization> I personally think per promo is a great idea
[2023-01-02 20:04:31] <%m3elv1n> simon has started changed thumbs on his old videos that still get views
[2023-01-02 20:04:40] <%m3elv1n> changing*
[2023-01-02 20:04:40] <%Dezalleycat> I think TOTY content will solidify my thinking on how FIFA videos depict where this game is going
[2023-01-02 20:04:42] <+xTaylor91> What about doing more collabs?
[2023-01-02 20:04:46] <@%Viperlization> if I can get the psd of that
[2023-01-02 20:04:52] <+skybluearmy03> Project Messi videos with your lad?
[2023-01-02 20:05:40] <@%AaronBrookes94> Don't the Sidemen have like 50 or so people in the background? Something like 6 camerapeople (Not sure if Kon still does it) then a group dedicated to research and ideas etc
[2023-01-02 20:05:49] <satvikkkk> at least u took the risk when u had more disposable income xqcM
[2023-01-02 20:05:55] <@%Viperlization> you're in a position where the change is coming
[2023-01-02 20:05:58] <%Dezalleycat> @aaronbrookes94 Of course
[2023-01-02 20:06:00] <@%Viperlization> that 4 hr video is the start brother

[2023-01-02 20:06:50] <+iceey_ice> Nuno Tavares is balling out
[2023-01-02 20:06:53] <olypiquelyonz> Are you thinking about upping the sorare content, or is that more hobby based where you just show rewards?

[2023-01-02 20:07:25] <@%Viperlization> that's so mad
[2023-01-02 20:07:34] <satvikkkk> what clause Viper xqcT

[2023-01-02 20:07:49] <%+threefatslugs> How does content that cashes in on nostalgia for previous FIFAs generally do? I.e., doing a Draft in every FIFA where Draft is available etc.
[2023-01-02 20:07:52] <%+matt_mcg_27> @Viperlization is that a real clause?

[2023-01-02 20:08:21] <oxjacksonx> draft to save the bank
[2023-01-02 20:08:28] <+CroaCrado> I watch a lot of Hasanabi and he freed up his twitch vods so that anyone can make clips and post it on YT and tiktok and monetize them. Of course he's huge, but it still makes him more visible and people find more of his clips
[2023-01-02 20:08:45] <satvikkkk> @NepentheZ would "can i get Ronaldo in 3 hours" video be evergreen for you? xqcT
[2023-01-02 20:09:12] <JeicoN_TK> @Viperlization Is that true? If so thats mad indeed
[2023-01-02 20:09:25] <@%AaronBrookes94> Series on YouTube are hard these days, people seem to watch the one off bangers more than the month long series, but you've got to find gold every time to really make it work

[2023-01-02 20:10:22] <%+djeff1985> for me I never missed a rtg video because I might miss out on learning something or a new grind , because the grind hasn't changed much in last few years maybe had change on rtg views ?

[2023-01-02 20:10:38] <blueb1rd> VOD channels are something all full time streamers should do. I have VOD channels on in the background all the time while working
[2023-01-02 20:10:44] <%robo_cfc> Think danny aarons has the same, they clip up his stream straight away
[2023-01-02 20:11:09] <%+KapzeMcLovin> Personally I really enjoy the longer videos. From you and other creators. Making it feel more or less like a podcast while i'm on the game myself. I know you've done podcasts before and that was amazing imo. Though i understand that it's a lot of work
[2023-01-02 20:11:11] <%+liquerbumhol> need some reaction videos with the boys, discord, reddit memes people love reaction vids

[2023-01-02 20:11:32] <@%AaronBrookes94> We tried that back on Facebook, issue is while I got like 5 streams worth of moments that would make clips, Facebook itself was impossible to really clip because of how the clips work and going back to previous stream it was nearly impossible to clip

[2023-01-02 20:19:41] <%+Brandez84> Mane was liverpools best player imo
[2023-01-02 20:19:44] <Drakkerz> they miss Jota

[2023-01-02 20:19:49] <choclate_craver> Yes mane was more important to liverpool than salah even if salah had better output
[2023-01-02 20:19:50] <%Dezalleycat> Liverpool are heavily in debt by that mane sale
[2023-01-02 20:19:56] <+BYCakes> well that's because Jota and Diaz have been injured all season
[2023-01-02 20:19:58] <+1predz> as a lfc fan, mane leaving is not an issue. just looks like it cus we are playing bad

[2023-01-02 20:20:03] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Also thay changed their pressing style

[2023-01-02 20:20:05] <%$GeorgeSlade_> i get we are missing chances but the major problem is the midfield.
[2023-01-02 20:20:06] <Jbunnerz> midfield needs improving
[2023-01-02 20:20:06] <%+brendanmcd8> Mane's press allowed Salah to play a bit more lazily - the effort from the front isnt there and makes their overall press poor now
[2023-01-02 20:20:07] <%fifa_mikek> their attack was alright (injuries have been massive), defensively they have been awful

[2023-01-02 20:20:25] <%JWISEY249799> it worked last year, we just need a rejunvenation in the midfield, plus massive forward injuried (jota, diaz, firmino) with no one coming off the bench up front, fabinho and vvd have been bad this season
