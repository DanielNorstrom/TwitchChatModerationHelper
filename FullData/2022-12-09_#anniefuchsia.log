[2022-12-09 14:20:08] <%larocc09> One reason keybinds work differently in games is whether they use low-level keypress vs key "events".  E.g., numpad at low level numlock doesn't matter, but the event is different whether numlock is off or on

[2022-12-09 14:23:00] <%Collnaris> is it possible to have your mouse number binds to work for num pad numbers?

[2022-12-09 14:23:38] VIEWERS: 2¬†324
[2022-12-09 14:23:40] <FreePwn> i was wrong about pitch being on number pad. think it was del and insert.  it would let you fly upside down, do loops etc
[2022-12-09 14:23:41] <nekrojiji> a palce to put binds
[2022-12-09 14:23:45] <%Collnaris> like for me, they work as the number row
[2022-12-09 14:23:48] <CaptainNoobzor> how do you like the scimitar buttons compared to the naga? i've read online that people find them harder to press (which is why i opted for the naga instead), but i love the moveable buttons that corsair has and razer doesn't
[2022-12-09 14:23:48] <%TGMDK> Why do i not see the Feldrake mount in my collections not even as an "unlearned" mount?
[2022-12-09 14:24:01] <SagePNW> Although it was weird trying to get it to work the first time. Binding inside iCue is weird.
[2022-12-09 14:24:19] <+fandomwicca> helloo how long will you be up for streaming? :D
[2022-12-09 14:24:28] <seenftw> <3
[2022-12-09 14:24:30] <%TGMDK> it's claimed on my loot page on twitch
[2022-12-09 14:24:32] <%jokuTM> I think Wow can use them as mouse buttons directly? Like you can see "Mouse Button 1" in the key binds.
[2022-12-09 14:24:40] <nekrojiji> I usually bind on this type of mice any button that is out of the reach of my left hand (with minimal movement)

[2022-12-09 14:25:55] <%Taylor131313> yeah, video guides that involve software sadly get outdated
[2022-12-09 14:26:09] <%Collnaris> that just means you can update them
[2022-12-09 14:26:19] <%mystlineid> Been thinking of getting an MMO mouse for some time, would make rotations much easier and seamless i reckon
[2022-12-09 14:26:26] <%Collnaris> the content makes itself
[2022-12-09 14:26:28] <scottsviper3> I think I use the razer trinity mouse, because you can map the mouse wheel. So for me mouse wheel up and and down are two different keys mouse wheel left and right are two more as well
[2022-12-09 14:26:28] <Syltarius> Isnt Mouse Button 1-3 LMB, RMB and the Wheel?

[2022-12-09 14:33:19] <%raiwist> if they brought back old drops people worked really hard towards, i think that's different
[2022-12-09 14:33:20] <%Nurutooo> wonder if they have tyrael charger as twitch drop when diablo 4 releases @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-09 14:33:20] <dantorixs> they need to do it with all the tcg stuff and old raids that cant get anymore
[2022-12-09 14:33:21] <bargholz_> But its cooler to have a mount that you cant get anymore no?

[2022-12-09 14:33:29] <%Makkan780> having 1 new thing like the gift sub pet is ok
[2022-12-09 14:33:33] <+cymruw> fomo = fear of missing out
[2022-12-09 14:33:33] <%Sne4ky79> they wont do more tcg mounts for a while, i think?
[2022-12-09 14:33:36] <kwichang86> I agree
[2022-12-09 14:33:36] <ImpishDork> it sucks they brought back a store item thought. I bought this mount when it was in the store and now everyone gets it for free.
[2022-12-09 14:33:36] <mishtress> yup agree, would love the opportunity to get the old content, and it's also free now
[2022-12-09 14:33:36] <Nz_Trip_> I agree

[2022-12-09 14:33:50] <+jibbidibbi> tyrael's charger would be a good one to bring back too esp with D4 coming out.
[2022-12-09 14:33:51] <ImpishDork> if it was something that was an ingame item they brought back that would be better
[2022-12-09 14:33:54] <GamerGroovenik> Can duplicate mounts or pets be gifted to another player?  Or are they account bound once claimed?
[2022-12-09 14:33:54] <%+Keeilb> hope they dont do this with the Vanilla collectors edition pets, its nice having something that not everyone have :)

[2022-12-09 14:35:32] <Robo_Rosa> i'm surprised they didn't do a drop specifically for world first race to boost the viewership

[2022-12-09 14:36:13] <%raiwist> for many people, having something few others have makes the game worthwhile. i dont really care much myself but there are some items that people committed a lot of time to achieve and to rerelease them trivialises that achievement

[2022-12-09 14:36:21] <hardheal> they could mix it up too :) honestly old stuff is great but adding odd time could be awesome too...

[2022-12-09 14:36:29] <SagePNW> So uh, I dont know if its bugged but I just got the windsteed and this is the first stream I ahve been in today just since you hit starting screen

[2022-12-09 15:03:11] <%Taylor131313> new super rare doesn't drop anything relevant for warlock anyway, so not worth except for achievement

[2022-12-09 16:08:54] <%Veger2112> i got a second account on a Low Pop RPG server for the rare of Rares!
[2022-12-09 16:09:00] <%MrMcfunpants> I think its so funny how all of my server's tailoring crafting orders are for a recipe you can't get until lvl 21 with the valdrakken accord
[2022-12-09 16:09:03] <Hansyx3> Wait, there was a spell you used called Vile Taint???
[2022-12-09 16:09:25] <%xxgeorge818x> ALL THE THINGS show u what you need to get for Completionist

[2022-12-09 16:10:40] <%Collnaris> it is a great name
[2022-12-09 16:10:44] <+LexDemonica> So main quest line + side quests still the quickest levelling?
[2022-12-09 16:11:04] <ThomasVonEger> On the map is one of secret toys to get called Yennus Kite wich looks like almost like that TCG one
[2022-12-09 16:11:13] <%PanicRush> if you are in a group that is speedrunning dungeons, yes sure
[2022-12-09 16:11:15] <%xxgeorge818x> Campaign gives the best xp
[2022-12-09 16:11:16] <+losido> levelling pretty quick either way
[2022-12-09 16:11:30] <%xxgeorge818x> Other than dungeon grinding
[2022-12-09 16:11:37] <%Veger2112> I got the TCG dragon kite along with the twitch drop kite
[2022-12-09 16:11:44] <%NayruHD> if you have decent gear from SL dungeons are really solid up to like 65 then you start getting outscaled
[2022-12-09 16:11:46] <%Makkan780> even jsut mining/herbing is decent xp
[2022-12-09 16:11:51] <DarthCollector> Dungeon leveling is good, leveled 3 toons to 60 from 30 in the last two days or so
[2022-12-09 16:11:56] <%+dancingstar1497> hi and thank you
[2022-12-09 16:11:58] <MarzipanPanda> @AnnieFuchsia can you please help me? i still havent gotten my claimed Feldrake :( i dont know what to do.. i asked blizzard and they said they are "on it" and i asked twitch and they said talk to blizzard.
[2022-12-09 16:12:00] <%Wardrick7> you can even lvl with professions now
[2022-12-09 16:12:08] VIEWERS: 5¬†825
[2022-12-09 16:12:13] <+bzow> Random dungeons through LFG is good for leveling too. The bonus XP you get is great. But if this is your first time through, it's good to do the campaign quest to unlock world quests.
[2022-12-09 16:12:13] <%Veger2112> Pet battles help with Lvl too

[2022-12-09 16:16:13] <%hallowpath> I knew I bought Swift Windsteed in the shop. 2013 is when it went up for sale. I bought it and it doesnt show in my collection. Where is the $ I spent on this mount? So I have to watch twitch to get it back? How is that fair? Where is my $25 that I spent on it?

I think that's a beer brand. Talking blue light. Anyways, RFLCT is a new skin care product that protects against blue light and unwanted blue light that may be coming from your monitor. So that's my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la cara. Little bottles. Stuff like that.

[2022-12-09 16:55:22] <Stoneth> Yeah, I remember when a lot of stuff from the store was removed. The helmet were removed but they were maid available again as Prime loot.
[2022-12-09 16:55:27] <DeanDeen> No
[2022-12-09 16:55:29] <SheikahSlays> you have to claim your hatchling first before you get the credit for the steed
[2022-12-09 16:55:29] <%lesterofsmeg2> and you get to watch Annie for 8 hours get it
[2022-12-09 16:55:30] <thorivatras> wait there is another mount drop ? no feldrake ???

[2022-12-09 16:55:40] <CLUB_V> imagine the viewers if they added the AH mount as a drop
[2022-12-09 16:55:44] <%OJ_Hype> it was removed in BFA iirc
[2022-12-09 16:55:45] <Hwanwok2> I'm kinda waiting for Blizzard to full send on spectral tiger being the twitch drop.
[2022-12-09 16:55:49] <SheikahSlays> @thorivatras feldrake has already come and gone
[2022-12-09 16:55:52] <%+Z3ROR> And you need to claim the pet first before you start for the mount i believe.
