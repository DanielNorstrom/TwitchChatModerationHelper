[2023-01-11 11:33:33] <LuzinZyrith> I normally look up like 3 different guide and narrow it down to my style ok
[2023-01-11 11:33:36] <PP4o4> yes. learning styles like "give me every content in a 2min YT-Video" otherwise i dont understand
[2023-01-11 11:33:39] <%+gunf1ght> I watched your guide and cleared g5 in 3 pulls
[2023-01-11 11:33:45] <%Vyse_Hex> they can fix it by not watching it tbh
[2023-01-11 11:33:47] <+Extros_> Imagine wanting to get info over a raid instead of going in blind but then shit on the guide

[2023-01-11 11:33:49] <+Extros_> HUH
[2023-01-11 11:34:12] <delboski> What's the point of doing short guide to complex raid. Even if it takes longer to watch guide saves time preventing wipes in a long run
[2023-01-11 11:34:19] <+Domixttv> server down eu ;/
[2023-01-11 11:34:22] <%Vyse_Hex> nowsdays alot of player are feeling entitled without reasons
[2023-01-11 11:34:24] <+MrPoncho04> @gunf1ght or maybe youre too stupid to understand ppl learn in diff ways
[2023-01-11 11:34:27] <%Vyse_Hex> @Domixttv take a guess
[2023-01-11 11:34:38] <PP4o4> tbh, criticism is fine and all, but ppl hating on the guides are just pathetic. Go do the raid blind then and release a better video you clowns xD
[2023-01-11 11:34:49] <LuzinZyrith> They can always 2.5x speed the video hence shorter kizzB
[2023-01-11 11:35:26] <+soch3q> @ATK I watched the guide of yours, pretty cool you partnered with mobalytics, although I had to supplement with memorizer's content to get the full picture
[2023-01-11 11:35:48] VIEWERS: 465
[2023-01-11 11:36:25] <PP4o4> idk. normally you want a general idea about the fight, and then just prog with that info, until you have it all memorized anyway...

[2023-01-11 11:36:54] <%+gunf1ght> next raid no one should make any guide and make na/eu figure it out like korea dose
[2023-01-11 11:36:59] <fyuun> ATK, I've recently started playing shadowhunter after watching the gigamilk interview video. I want to try out the spec/swift build but can't afford 5x3. Which engravings should I go for 4x3? Love your youtube content as always! NOTED
[2023-01-11 11:37:04] <PP4o4> and your vids had 99% of the info so if you still don't understand why you're wiping, you can look it up
[2023-01-11 11:37:10] <Assure__> I think it was very confusing to start with, but once I had pulled the gates once and went back to the guides it made a lot more sense. So for me a perspective from my own experience was needed.
