[2023-01-03 17:39:05] <Cynimon> I actually googled the showering and lightning thing maybe 2 years ago and it told me that was a myth. I told people that, wholeheartedly believing I was so smart for stopping misinformation.  2 Weeks ago, I told my girlfriend it's a myth and we looked it up. Saw the CDC recommendation and now I cannot be trusted.

[2023-01-03 17:59:30] <%looster412> tsuki ranged autos also don't have enough range to hit from outside tower line so
[2023-01-03 17:59:30] <%+Calvinman4> fun fact, the way that they do the "autos turning into abilities" is the cause of at least 20% of smite bugs by itself

[2023-01-03 18:00:24] <%+lightforceten> the point is his "empowered" autos still count as autos and therefore hit towers
[2023-01-03 18:00:24] <%CodyTheGod> when he released
[2023-01-03 18:00:25] <%+Calvinman4> clearly the combination auto/ability is not considered a separate mechanic under the hood, and so each ability has to be hardcoded to work correctly with certain items
