[2022-12-16 19:04:56] <RSMortefirous> i think it was a sign
[2022-12-16 19:05:19] <UtahVG> trickster is the killer im most wanting to try out, im new to dbd and almost never do killer games, so

[2022-12-16 20:58:12] <%izrador> it's okay, Chey, with all else you've told us about your food takes, you can admit to eating glue and we'd all just NODDERS
[2022-12-16 20:58:15] <hufflepugs> no but PVA blue on your hand in school, letting it dry and peeling it off
[2022-12-16 20:58:15] <+ArienOnFire> Just sayin, glue peeing is super satisfying... I used to do that with candle wax too! 😓😂

[2022-12-16 20:58:22] <!%jackiethevalkyrie> KEKW she wasn't licking the marker, she could just taste it from the contact of the marker lol

[2022-12-16 21:00:38] <%Mykeasaurus> I mean you would have to taste it to know that it tastes like it smells though right?
