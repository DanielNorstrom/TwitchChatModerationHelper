[2023-01-07 08:27:39] <%brettsalapa> I saw a video on Youtube where a guy with apparently credible sources that says he is predicting that Twitch Con this year will be here in Las Vegas.
[2023-01-07 08:28:21] VIEWERS: 154
[2023-01-07 08:28:43] <@%DiscoTech90> counterpoint: vegas, baby
[2023-01-07 08:28:55] <%brettsalapa> That's true. But part of his reasoning is that Allegiant Stadium, the Football stadium here, has a Twitch Lounge that Twitch itself paid for.
[2023-01-07 08:29:41] <!%Supreme> while i don't really see why they would move it from where its been, tbh las vegas is not notably further from twitch hq than san diego
[2023-01-07 08:29:47] <%brettsalapa> And the stadium could easily hold the Partner Party.
[2023-01-07 08:30:00] <!%Supreme> but allegiant is way too large of a venue for that kind of event
[2023-01-07 08:30:03] <@%DiscoTech90> the way i understand corp culture for vegas cons is: get yourself there, get paid for 0.5-1 day of "work" enjoy the rest of the weekend

[2023-01-07 08:30:53] <%brettsalapa> That was another point that the guy in that video made. Flights here are on the cheaper side.

[2023-01-07 08:31:58] <%brettsalapa> The attendees would also have so many options as far as hotels to stay at here, too.

[2023-01-07 10:34:24] <@%TheInfamousBug> It takes literal years for some games to go from concept to full make. Back in the NES days, even Mario 3 only took a year and some change to make.
[2023-01-07 10:34:25] <!%Furty1> gaming is so big now, i think devs should focus on making their niche games, instead of trying to satisfy everyone...which is impossible to do
