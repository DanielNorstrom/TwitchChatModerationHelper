[2022-12-07 17:51:06] <legend_sword_911> tier 8 tanks are 3 types: -strong premium tanks for p2w, weak bond tanks for making credits, techtree tanks which may be good, but cannot compete with premium tanks. worse than t.10 lol.

[2022-12-07 18:08:58] <%irishmauler> @skill4ltu BZ-176 has 5mm less pen than 183. Great for exploiting mistakes players make. Good players will troll you and you will suck with it. I used booster rocket to ram and pin a E50M that was trying to flank me.
