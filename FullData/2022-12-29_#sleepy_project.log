[2022-12-29 07:09:52] <Killy43> @Killy43 You're right. Interchange just doesn't have audio finished

[2022-12-29 07:10:16] VIEWERS: 208
[2022-12-29 07:10:22] <%Rappolt> Interchange just has more prominent poorly made audio boundaries than other maps
[2022-12-29 07:10:33] <+Riley3999> interchange doesn't have it's lighting finished KEKW
[2022-12-29 07:10:48] <%jarv_bph> They got rid of steam audio mid wipe because they couldn't figure it out
[2022-12-29 07:10:52] <%Rappolt> @Riley3999 The lightbulbs keep breaking
[2022-12-29 07:11:09] <+Riley3999> Copium interchange on release had fine lighting and they broke it
[2022-12-29 07:11:20] <%Rappolt> Something 'funny' is that hte only feature of Steam Audio they 'implemented' was Binaural Audio. It's just a toggle in Unity
[2022-12-29 07:11:51] <+Mijolnir__> patch notes says binural works on factory, customs, woods other maps are later updates
[2022-12-29 07:12:02] <+Riley3999> I liked the steam audio when it worked it was so much more directional
[2022-12-29 07:12:02] <+NeoRussia> turning off binaural audio only changes the audio from 3D to 2D
[2022-12-29 07:12:02] <%jarv_bph> Its too bad because it was def better with steam audio than without

[2022-12-29 07:12:28] <%+MagmarL> Sleepy it's just that you need to get used to the new audio
[2022-12-29 07:12:39] <%+MagmarL> it isn't steam audio anymore, it's "oculus" or smth
[2022-12-29 07:13:09] <+NeoRussia> there it was Veritas I think it was who made a 3 hour video explaining Tarkov's audio
[2022-12-29 07:13:19] <%jarv_bph> the point of directional audio is that its should be instinctive
[2022-12-29 07:13:27] <CupcakeWarrior> how is the wipe adventure going
[2022-12-29 07:13:28] <+Riley3999> yeah the range on audio is weird it's not a "getting used to" it's that the range is just fucked

[2022-12-29 07:14:53] <%Rappolt> If you mean what I said, yeah. It's little more than a checkbox for sounds to add the binaural distortion effects. Logitech and Dolby have done the same process for at least a decade now. The next feature was supposed to be sound pathing through open areas and penetrating walls, but it was either not added at all or barely more than a test amount
[2022-12-29 07:15:11] <@%jilly_mod> but the range is crazy the gssh s i could hear across the map

[2022-12-29 10:33:30] <%Rappolt> The gun is so messed up, that at point blank, if you aim at the chest, you hit head

[2022-12-29 11:23:54] <martysbigiron> so whenever the barrel overheats you would change the barrel with a spare, if you dont, you permanently warp the barrel and decrease accuracy
