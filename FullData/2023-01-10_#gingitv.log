[2023-01-10 14:02:02] [Notification] Neyebae subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! [Here's a shitty poem. Twitch Prime is a real delight. It makes streaming such a sight. Ads are gone and emotes alight. It's the cherry on top of the night. With free games and in-game content too. There's no reason not to renew. A monthly channel sub is all part of the deal. Twitch Prime is quite the steal. So if you're on Twitch and love this stream. Sign up for Amazon Prime, it's a dream. Link your account and get ready to shine. With Twitch Prime, everything will be just fine.]

[2023-01-10 15:01:29] <siller777> @MissAvantasia sad thing it discourages a lot of players, and often these guys are not at all the ones which should open their mouths
[2023-01-10 15:01:31] <%Nanny> frost mage is better for intermission dmg on the last boss, he ran out to switch after wiping

[2023-01-10 15:04:17] <+Sajm0> Frost probably better than arcane in a lot of pugs, especially if you're wiping/dying

[2023-01-10 20:17:44] <+ThatMody> Hi chat :D   Im new & started playing Fury while exploring WoW (tbh I looked up button smashing class, since Im new & didnt know about buffs, etc).  I like WoW now, but as I searched about good Raid Classes, I see that Fury isnt really ranked high.   I like Raids & PvP. Should I stick with Fury or change?   I like a dmg role. My playing style is "go at the boss and do dmg", and I don't have the hang of the buffs yet but I can learn :) I saw some videos talking about DH, Rouge or Hunter

[2023-01-10 23:15:08] <Chr0nicConsumer> @ushirohanten i think they're honestly pretty equal in effectiveness but rogue fits in every comp with zero setup and arcane requires an entire team to play around it perfectly... so rogue is better in that sense, 100%

[2023-01-10 23:17:04] <OnkelPachal> @GingiTV after Patch Sub or still Outlaw ?
[2023-01-10 23:17:07] <+Ganondalf1337> what about ingi wrist? @GingiTV
[2023-01-10 23:17:08] <+florpie_> don't forget about the trinket that ken is holding for you or robin @GingiTV
[2023-01-10 23:17:10] <Chr0nicConsumer> @smokywow SMOrc me no think, me only ask tier list
[2023-01-10 23:17:18] <mircead1986> but maybe you get a good trinket in the vault AND a 421weapon - what do you get?
[2023-01-10 23:17:18] <@%smokywow> fair enough
[2023-01-10 23:17:33] <anthr4zit> @GingiTV Why is your mainraid on tuesday evening? isn't that super ineffecient for ever other activity outside the raid?

[2023-01-10 23:17:56] <%+Streetylolz> hey @GingiTV what do you think are the best ranges in order for m+ after the buffs?
[2023-01-10 23:18:02] <@%smokywow> for example on my shaman, my highest sim craft was the boots, thats only because my boots at the time were complete piss stats & ilevel
[2023-01-10 23:18:09] <@%smokywow> sims are fake if you dont know what they mean
