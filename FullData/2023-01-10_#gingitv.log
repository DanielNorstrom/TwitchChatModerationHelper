[2023-01-10 14:02:02] [Notification] Neyebae subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! [Here's a shitty poem. Twitch Prime is a real delight. It makes streaming such a sight. Ads are gone and emotes alight. It's the cherry on top of the night. With free games and in-game content too. There's no reason not to renew. A monthly channel sub is all part of the deal. Twitch Prime is quite the steal. So if you're on Twitch and love this stream. Sign up for Amazon Prime, it's a dream. Link your account and get ready to shine. With Twitch Prime, everything will be just fine.]

[2023-01-10 15:01:31] <%Nanny> frost mage is better for intermission dmg on the last boss, he ran out to switch after wiping

[2023-01-10 16:22:05] <phnxx87> ye ok but even if mage is meta for example it isnt still designed for pugs somehow
[2023-01-10 16:22:13] <%sanishere> @phnxx87 minkaS>> he wasnt referring to ur question lol

[2023-01-10 16:22:49] <its_lycaa> nothing is designed for "pugs". If you wanna pump 15-20, try to get ur raider up with any class so people know, that you know the dungeons
[2023-01-10 16:22:58] <phnxx87> ye doing it as tank right now
[2023-01-10 16:23:00] <its_lycaa> also aim to time more +15s, so you have and "x" timed 15s, gives people the trust as well
[2023-01-10 16:23:25] <%sanishere> or do ur own keys>> best way to get keystone master aswell
[2023-01-10 16:23:30] <its_lycaa> ^
[2023-01-10 16:24:06] <its_lycaa> but if you insist on a class, i'd probably say rogue now

[2023-01-10 19:32:02] <pybus2> @thenoisebringer MDI is an event that you can choose to participate in but no one forces you to, and in M+ you get no rewards after a certain rating (2500 If I recall) and you need only +20s for the vault. so there is no mandatory competitive aspect there

[2023-01-10 20:17:44] <+ThatMody> Hi chat :D   Im new & started playing Fury while exploring WoW (tbh I looked up button smashing class, since Im new & didnt know about buffs, etc).  I like WoW now, but as I searched about good Raid Classes, I see that Fury isnt really ranked high.   I like Raids & PvP. Should I stick with Fury or change?   I like a dmg role. My playing style is "go at the boss and do dmg", and I don't have the hang of the buffs yet but I can learn :) I saw some videos talking about DH, Rouge or Hunter

[2023-01-10 20:18:14] <soulhealer95> @GingiTV if during burst window when you arcane missile you dont get nether tempest procs do you arcane missle again or just 2 blast anyway for dmg?
[2023-01-10 20:18:23] <kingraheel> @rival_xo dont think so , he just quit wow
[2023-01-10 20:18:23] <tr0x_77> Don't think bcuz of his performance, Scripe said he did good

[2023-01-10 20:18:40] <Rhoonar> what rwf does to a man
[2023-01-10 20:18:43] <+emmaniels> @ThatMody  warrior, prot is best then arms. play what you like.  warriors brings utility to raid. and they might not perform best this tier, but there is always next tier.
[2023-01-10 20:19:04] <godplayertv> these are the best 2 trinkets for mage or the best ones he has :/ ?

[2023-01-10 22:58:17] <MyggenTv> @MyggenTv Thx for answer! :)
[2023-01-10 22:58:39] <el___ninja> I mean I know it's piss easy but you know first hand the min max in MDI so they'll prolly try to group up for it last second
[2023-01-10 22:59:05] <FreeSquadCarry> is outlaw still the play with the nerf on server restart?

[2023-01-10 23:15:08] <Chr0nicConsumer> @ushirohanten i think they're honestly pretty equal in effectiveness but rogue fits in every comp with zero setup and arcane requires an entire team to play around it perfectly... so rogue is better in that sense, 100%

[2023-01-10 23:15:45] <tre___streck> yea definetly a weapon
[2023-01-10 23:15:46] <@%smokywow> sims are fake
[2023-01-10 23:15:47] <tre___streck> or maybe the weapon

[2023-01-10 23:15:52] <chinasnack> enginner CR bracers?
[2023-01-10 23:15:53] <avraan93> ring gives moore stats
[2023-01-10 23:15:55] <mircead1986> but maybe you get a good trinket in the vault AND a 421weapon - what do you get?
[2023-01-10 23:15:59] <%WeGameBad> why ring? aren't you hoping to use eranog ring and CoS ring?
[2023-01-10 23:16:06] <aRTeeCee> boots with dmg effect
[2023-01-10 23:16:09] <extreeme11> would u go vers ring on sub aswell? diurna
[2023-01-10 23:16:09] <@%smokywow> instead of blindly following ur best sim use sims with critical thinking guys :)
[2023-01-10 23:16:16] <%victor3219> COS ring

[2023-01-10 23:17:08] <+florpie_> don't forget about the trinket that ken is holding for you or robin @GingiTV
[2023-01-10 23:17:10] <Chr0nicConsumer> @smokywow SMOrc me no think, me only ask tier list
[2023-01-10 23:17:18] <mircead1986> but maybe you get a good trinket in the vault AND a 421weapon - what do you get?
[2023-01-10 23:17:18] <@%smokywow> fair enough
[2023-01-10 23:17:33] <anthr4zit> @GingiTV Why is your mainraid on tuesday evening? isn't that super ineffecient for ever other activity outside the raid?

[2023-01-10 23:18:02] <@%smokywow> for example on my shaman, my highest sim craft was the boots, thats only because my boots at the time were complete piss stats & ilevel

[2023-01-10 23:19:04] <+Snown77> @Phoenix1142  25 is done already
[2023-01-10 23:19:16] <BigBoyKent> @xdobobx no
