[2022-12-07 10:07:41] <slackerunchained> Cerise takes another step towards becoming more like Joel Vargskelethor... And I am strangely okay with that. :)
[2022-12-07 10:07:42] <+Nyanomancer> Back in 2012, I tried to generate a world with 1000 years of history on a shitty laptop. Took 36 hours
[2022-12-07 10:07:43] <Quitutatur> You can even check it out on legends mode and use it for a DND campaign LUL
[2022-12-07 10:07:51] <%+phantomsalmon> I don't remember if it is good to have aquifer in your map
[2022-12-07 10:08:01] <!%PepperKuroaji> Joel is a streamer
[2022-12-07 10:08:02] <+Nyanomancer> Aquifers SUCK
[2022-12-07 10:08:13] <%ShadeEleven> is there ttk for this?
[2022-12-07 10:08:16] <slackerunchained> It's good. Joel is a funny Swedush guy.
[2022-12-07 10:08:22] <Quitutatur> Madlad actually waited 36 hours for the 1000 years world LUL pure respect
[2022-12-07 10:08:25] <%bunglinglummox> @Nyanomancer That's not entirely your own fault. Multithreading is (was?) not supported.
[2022-12-07 10:08:27] <slackerunchained> *Swedish
[2022-12-07 10:08:27] <%+phantomsalmon> legends is info about the world
[2022-12-07 10:08:30] <!%PepperKuroaji> good ol jobel
[2022-12-07 10:08:32] <%+phantomsalmon> I think
[2022-12-07 10:08:32] <%bunglinglummox> legends is literally just a reading the history mode
[2022-12-07 10:08:37] <Quitutatur> legends is reading the lore of the world
[2022-12-07 10:08:46] <+Nyanomancer> @bunglinglummox I wasn't complaining, I just wanted to see how long it would take. It was magical
[2022-12-07 10:09:10] VIEWERS: 43
[2022-12-07 10:09:14] <%+phantomsalmon> you probably want that tutorial yes
[2022-12-07 10:09:15] <KaitoOnTheClock> Seems good (got no clue what is going on) SeemsGood
[2022-12-07 10:09:42] <%bunglinglummox> Playing DF without some kind of help is a terrible idea.
[2022-12-07 10:09:45] <slackerunchained> In the classic version there was also an 'Adventure' mode where you could take control of a single character and just wander and adventure, wherever. I don't know if that's in thus version. yet, though.
[2022-12-07 10:09:47] <KaitoOnTheClock> I watched the game as a kid. Didn't understand it LUL
[2022-12-07 10:09:50] <+Nyanomancer> a true trial by fire
[2022-12-07 10:09:51] <KaitoOnTheClock> Wait. The game has graphics now? monkaS

[2022-12-07 10:10:14] <!%PepperKuroaji> ye it's got graphics by default now
[2022-12-07 10:10:21] <%+phantomsalmon> tigers are definitely not the scariest thing here
[2022-12-07 10:10:22] <KaitoOnTheClock> Massive improvement
[2022-12-07 10:10:26] <%+phantomsalmon> its the fish
[2022-12-07 10:10:28] <Quitutatur> Strike the earth!
[2022-12-07 10:10:32] <%bunglinglummox> So, the wildlife in this game is fairly heavily randomised. This means there are tigers in this biome.
[2022-12-07 10:10:32] <%ShadeEleven> how many in chat have played this? (i haven't)
[2022-12-07 10:10:40] <Quitutatur> Don't worry... the tigers are the least of your problems
[2022-12-07 10:10:47] <KaitoOnTheClock> @ShadeEleven Never played but watched back in 2012

[2022-12-07 10:11:49] <%+phantomsalmon> also there is 50 z-levels plus additional 15 sky z-levels

[2022-12-07 10:13:42] <%bunglinglummox> @ShadeEleven not good ones, but players did manage to design and make a magma cannon using pumps
[2022-12-07 10:13:56] <%bunglinglummox> it had an effective radius much wider than its effective range
[2022-12-07 10:13:57] <+Nyanomancer> There's a mod that replaces the cats with NekoArc

[2022-12-07 10:15:13] <%+phantomsalmon> you probably will want to dig down as soon as possible, this looks like sand
[2022-12-07 10:15:19] <Quitutatur> i would recommend digging a little bit deeper so you don't get sand
[2022-12-07 10:15:27] <!%PepperKuroaji> oh the reason I brought up Nethack is because it also uses ASCII art (you can use graphics packs tho) It's a very detailed and old (still in development!) roguelike
[2022-12-07 10:15:30] <Quitutatur> cave-ins are pretty common in sand
[2022-12-07 10:15:33] <%bunglinglummox> sand is good, we like sand... but yeah, no metal
[2022-12-07 10:15:34] <slackerunchained> Tip #1: Remember you're working with dwarves, Cerise. You're going to need booze. Lots of booze.

[2022-12-07 10:16:27] <%bunglinglummox> @slackerunchained Need is a strong word. Players have made sober fortresses before. Which is proof enough that the players of this game are mostly sadists.
[2022-12-07 10:16:33] <%ShinSpiegel> There is a tutorial now?!

[2022-12-07 10:17:36] <slackerunchained> @bunglinglummox Dwarf Fortress is all about finding different ways to have 'Fun'. :)
[2022-12-07 10:17:50] <%ShinSpiegel> @bunglinglummox I did play a lot on the ascii one when I was younger (and had time to learn the thing)

[2022-12-07 10:23:31] <%ShinSpiegel> It's quite complex the relationship on this game, at least last time I compared with the Rimworld for example,
[2022-12-07 10:23:36] <%Codofwisdom> This game has INFINITE depth. You can skim it if you like, but you can also go pretty damn deep.
[2022-12-07 10:24:23] <%Codofwisdom> YEAH. Rimworld focuses more on psychology than personality.
[2022-12-07 10:24:31] <%$Memil03> Mhhm thats cool i like that!

[2022-12-07 10:25:39] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> Hello Cerise
[2022-12-07 10:25:58] <%bunglinglummox> The dev actually coded dwarves to have triple the standard size of liver to cope with this.
[2022-12-07 10:26:05] <KaitoOnTheClock> So they do eventually need actual water
[2022-12-07 10:26:06] <Quitutatur> i would have recommended you to at least skim a little bit of the historical figures on the legends mode so you could understand a little bit of the "depth" things can go

[2022-12-07 10:28:08] <%Codofwisdom> It is very likely that you will loose your first few runs, but that's perfectly fine.

[2022-12-07 10:30:44] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> Something I've been meaning to ask - did the discord get an overhaul or something recently? I feel like I'm missing out on channels particularly of the art variety
[2022-12-07 10:30:48] <%bunglinglummox> You can maybe slavage some of your stuff if you change the stockpile location. Dwarves can still walk in 3/7 water.

[2022-12-07 10:33:21] <%Codofwisdom> I always look for a Brook next to forest and mountains for my places.
[2022-12-07 10:33:23] <%bunglinglummox> I do enjoy finding an embark site that is only partially covered by an aquifer. But that's fiddly.
[2022-12-07 10:33:24] <%$Memil03> I dont like how the camera is like not smooth
[2022-12-07 10:33:43] <%Codofwisdom> Aquifier: rock square that contains water
[2022-12-07 10:33:46] <%bunglinglummox> An aquifer means a layer of water-carrying soil.
[2022-12-07 10:33:46] <AdverseAspect> oh, nothing in the game is smooth
[2022-12-07 10:33:46] <%+phantomsalmon> it is funny water rock which people get water from
[2022-12-07 10:33:47] <%Codofwisdom> It releases water when mined into
[2022-12-07 10:33:51] <!%Cewelowic> Aquifers are bodies of waters under the surface
[2022-12-07 10:33:52] <%bunglinglummox> You can't dig into it without creating water.
[2022-12-07 10:34:10] <%+phantomsalmon> Aquifers are what we tap into with real life wells
[2022-12-07 10:34:24] <%bunglinglummox> You can use it as a water source, and as a drain, but it's hard to find a way *through* it without drowing everything.
[2022-12-07 10:34:39] <%+Nry_Chan> Is this going to end like the usual rimworld colonies, except with less pew pew?
[2022-12-07 10:34:40] <%Codofwisdom> Brooks are good because your dwarves can cross them without a bridge, and still have fish.
[2022-12-07 10:34:41] <%+phantomsalmon> also you want flux stone
[2022-12-07 10:34:41] <!%Cewelowic> Light aquifers drip into the space if you dig into, heavy aquifers are effectively underground lakes
[2022-12-07 10:34:51] <%Codofwisdom> They're also a good source of water for farming.

[2022-12-07 11:15:28] <%bunglinglummox> As a general piece of advice, you should use more depth. It makes the fort more compact (and therefore quicker to travel), and you'll find more metals and things.
[2022-12-07 11:15:32] <Quitutatur> you can make it save more often but saving can take a while

[2022-12-07 11:44:15] <%bunglinglummox> I would suggest you get a crafting industry going before the next traders arrive. A craftsdwarf's workshop is all you really need, and as much stone as you can dig.
[2022-12-07 11:45:05] <%bunglinglummox> Then just set "make stone crafts" on repeat.
[2022-12-07 11:45:07] <+CorwinCZ> There is no "stone" in DF. Every stone is modeled by real-world minerals. Click on the boulders, it shows you their uses. If it has only building / crafting, use it as "stone" :)

[2022-12-07 11:59:32] <thelittlememer> you need to mark your animal for slaughter, you can do it from the livestock tab after opening 'citizens'
[2022-12-07 11:59:59] <%bunglinglummox> you might want to make sure you pick an adult, the adolescents don't always give bones

[2022-12-07 12:00:47] <%rylexander0> There is so much detail
[2022-12-07 12:00:55] <%bunglinglummox> yeah, horses actually working isn't implemented
[2022-12-07 12:00:57] <Whiris> should pasture those grazing animals or they will starve
[2022-12-07 12:00:57] <%TripCyclone97> I've always wanted to get into this but it's always been so intimidating to my smooth brain
[2022-12-07 12:01:28] <Quitutatur> someone has the job of butchering?
[2022-12-07 12:01:31] VIEWERS: 220
[2022-12-07 12:01:31] <%bunglinglummox> designate a pasture zone outside
[2022-12-07 12:01:43] <%Synesh> One of the known bugs of the old version, was that Cats would die of alchool poisoning because pows got covered in spilled beer and when they licked to clean they would get drunk.
[2022-12-07 12:01:55] <%Synesh> And the paws could contain endless liquid.
[2022-12-07 12:02:11] <Drimears> @Synesh its a feature
[2022-12-07 12:02:25] <%bunglinglummox> "butcher an animal" means a dead one I think and requires a corpse, slaughtering was the correct approach
[2022-12-07 12:02:26] <+Chef_Hathaway> there was also the old school catsplosion
[2022-12-07 12:02:27] <%rylexander0> I love how the way shes dug out the mountain is just like how she would in rimworld. It feels nostalgic xd
[2022-12-07 12:02:47] <%Synesh> To quote Sseth "The game chokes and dies the moment you forget to sterilize the cats."
[2022-12-07 12:02:57] <thelittlememer> i believe butcher should happen automatically from slaughtering
[2022-12-07 12:03:01] <Whiris> have to assign the animals to the pasture
[2022-12-07 12:03:02] <%bunglinglummox> a catsplosion is a sort of... soft lock that occurs when you have so many cats that it kills your framerate
[2022-12-07 12:03:09] <+Chef_Hathaway> cats bred so quickly they'd make your game unplayable
[2022-12-07 12:03:15] <%Alaiziabel> The fortress is still sutviving? 👀
[2022-12-07 12:03:22] <%bunglinglummox> it's cats in particular because of the way cats work as pets

[2022-12-07 12:03:59] <%bunglinglummox> unlike every other animal, cats can assign themselves an owner without the player... and pets can't be butchered, so there's no way to stop them breeding infinitely once this happens
[2022-12-07 12:04:07] <Quitutatur> you couldn't easily kill the cats since they adopted the dwarves
[2022-12-07 12:04:28] <Whiris> have to assign the animals to the pasture

[2022-12-07 12:05:07] <%bunglinglummox> you assign from the pasture, not from the animal

[2022-12-07 12:39:20] <%+Nry_Chan> Over here how it works is basically, everyone with a job has to get an health insurance. If you can't afford one the government will give you one. If the medical bill exceeds the yearly "personal risk" the rest is paid by the government/insurance company. Insurance companies can offer additional services though, like hospital preference, dental care, insurance for glasses/hearing aids etc

He drops a bag of tengu tax and a note before going back in the hole.  Opening the note, it simply says “You are the 8K high-definition image to my ASCII 8bit pixel game”.  Cerise muses happily that one of her favorite crows can be cute, albeit also corny, while she tries to learn this game.  She also wonders how he got in her game again. cheer100

By the time the child grows up, they're either insane or so psychologically scarred that they barely notice when their parents die.

[2022-12-07 13:11:47] <%bunglinglummox> Then there was the puppy fountain. Basically you designate a pit several floors above the dining room. Then you drop dogs down it and watch them explode on people's dinner.

[2022-12-07 13:14:40] <%bunglinglummox> They eventually get to an end state of "doesn't really care about anything any more" at which point it's very hard to get them to break.

[2022-12-07 14:28:06] <mudinho48> cerise, be careful with stair, if you want a dwarf to go up or down you need a up and down stair

[2022-12-07 14:36:55] <%bunglinglummox> once you have your barracks etc. set up, you need to pick some dwarves to be a military and create a training schedule

[2022-12-07 14:37:26] <%bunglinglummox> bear in mind that too long training will make them unhappy, and if you are too strict with the orders you can end up starving them to death too

[2022-12-07 14:38:03] <mudinho48> you set a month to train
[2022-12-07 14:38:12] <%bunglinglummox> you have basically two controls: whether they train in a given month, and how many out of the squad need to be present to train at any given moment
[2022-12-07 14:38:25] <%bunglinglummox> if you pick the whole squad they can't eat, drink or rest because they all need to be there
[2022-12-07 14:39:01] <%bunglinglummox> it looks like it has abstracted things in steam, "staggered training" is probably the eat/drink thing
[2022-12-07 14:39:13] <PersonaFreek01> @zimmermandio you shoot a stone airow plus wooden support for the caves and mines also trade
[2022-12-07 14:39:48] <zimmermandio> @PersonaFreek01 ah thats too bad, thx for the reminder anyway
[2022-12-07 14:39:51] <%bunglinglummox> eventually you can do things like set sentry outposts and patrol routes, but for now you probably want to focus on just having them learn to actually fight

[2022-12-07 14:41:03] <mudinho48> i tend to put all my dwarves on a squad and stagger the training
[2022-12-07 14:41:06] <%bunglinglummox> it's basically just really hard to get a squad trained before the first time you get attacked, and some or most of them will probably die
[2022-12-07 14:41:23] <%bunglinglummox> the standard approach is to throw them into the meat grinder and let the survivors join your *real* military
[2022-12-07 14:41:50] <mudinho48> also dwarfs like to train, not all like real combat
[2022-12-07 14:42:01] <%bunglinglummox> I think the goblins are being slow to attack because your fort isn't that rich.
