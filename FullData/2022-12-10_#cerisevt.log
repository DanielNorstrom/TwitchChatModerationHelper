[2022-12-10 08:48:06] <!%$RickAltair> *goes back to work*
[2022-12-10 08:48:25] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> you are already caught
[2022-12-10 08:48:34] <!%$RickAltair> LUL
[2022-12-10 08:48:48] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> I can do it again
[2022-12-10 08:48:54] <!%$RickAltair> I need to have like a catch phrase when I do this... "Damnit, it's always the Knees!"
[2022-12-10 08:49:14] <!%$RickAltair> "Darn, I was knabbed again!"
[2022-12-10 08:49:22] <!%$RickAltair> Something cheesy like that
[2022-12-10 08:49:26] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> but storm and galondir can catch you too
[2022-12-10 08:49:32] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> today
[2022-12-10 08:49:47] <@%^StreamElements> Check out my Youtube! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1jNLUqwIQoM40CukSIKqGQ
[2022-12-10 08:49:52] <!%$RickAltair> Does Galondir even ever leave?
[2022-12-10 08:50:23] <!%$RickAltair> I always assume they're here when I say something.
[2022-12-10 08:50:31] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> nope
[2022-12-10 08:51:06] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> they are always on the "users in chat" menu
[2022-12-10 08:52:05] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> now when they pop into chat that is an unknown to everyone besides the mods
[2022-12-10 08:52:20] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> and cerise
[2022-12-10 08:52:41] <!%+Galondir> zumivtPATPAT kuromiyaHeadpat
[2022-12-10 08:53:27] <!%+Galondir> Going down to throw my laundry in the machine also, i always do my laundry on Saturday's since its the only time i can do it. bimSweating Well either Saturday or Sunday
[2022-12-10 08:55:49] <%Stormeflame> i is back, Henlo Rick
[2022-12-10 08:55:56] <!%$RickAltair> Yo
[2022-12-10 08:56:12] <!%+Galondir> cptdandyLick ladylu23Wiggle maipanLick
[2022-12-10 08:56:46] <%Stormeflame> how ya doin today Rick
[2022-12-10 08:56:52] <!%$RickAltair> I'm sure I'll never be "first" in here or when it's empty, nor do I ever care to try.  I just get a personal giggle to drop in and say a line inbetween work tickets to have Knee or someone say "nope".
[2022-12-10 08:57:15] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> you were first yesterday
[2022-12-10 08:57:16] <@%^StreamElements> Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cerise_VT
[2022-12-10 08:57:34] <!%$RickAltair> @Stormeflame I'm doing pretty good.  Last day of work before my 2 week vacation and work is sorta light.  Hope you are well as well
[2022-12-10 08:57:55] <!%+Galondir> Because i was stuck at work, and couldnt take part in pre-stream chat kyunCry stupid day shift work weeks, next week its night shift, so i can catch the streams live
[2022-12-10 08:58:07] <!%$RickAltair> @TheKneeCapKnabber I figure someone is always here before me.  You said Cerise can only see the last hour before chat or something?
[2022-12-10 08:58:24] <!%$RickAltair> I know she said my name first, but I figure someone is ALWAYS here before me
[2022-12-10 08:58:29] <%Stormeflame> @Stormeflame thats good to hear hope you enjoy your vacation! i got covid so im dealing with that lol
[2022-12-10 08:59:12] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> mods/cerise when they pop into chat they can see a certain amount of time before they pop into chat
[2022-12-10 08:59:33] <!%$RickAltair> @TheKneeCapKnabber Oh, that's how it works.  Guess I misunderstood before.
[2022-12-10 09:00:03] <!%$RickAltair> @Stormeflame Yuck, the covid-cooties.  Hope it isn't that bad for you and that you recover 100% soon.
[2022-12-10 09:00:07] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> so when you got caught yesterday that was how
[2022-12-10 09:00:48] <!%$RickAltair> Interesting.  I've never been on the mod side of things nor do I have a desire to, so I'm blind to those mechanics.
[2022-12-10 09:01:10] <%Stormeflame> @Stormeflame its kicking my ass, would hate to know what this wouldve been like if i didnt have the vax, but im surviving, the fever is the worst part by far
[2022-12-10 09:01:40] <!%$RickAltair> As I was telling Jakal the other day, I feel I'd make a horrible mod.  I'm too skeptical of people in general nonetheless the internet and I'd be too protective.  LUL
[2022-12-10 09:02:45] <%Stormeflame> i feel like that can be a good thing tho, it would be your job to protect Cerise and Chat from crazies so as long as it wasnt TOO overprotective it wouldnt be too bad lol
[2022-12-10 09:02:45] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> I feel like I'm a bad mod sometimes since I tend to type the shout outs slow bimCry
[2022-12-10 09:02:51] <!%$RickAltair> @Stormeflame Nice to see the vax working for ya.  I haven't had the "pleasure" of getting it (knocks on wood).  Then again my normal routine has me rarely around people to get it.
[2022-12-10 09:03:19] <%$Memil03> Ello! yokaiHey yokaiHey
[2022-12-10 09:03:36] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> Cerise is going to have a lot of scrolling today to see the top of chat yokaiLUL
[2022-12-10 09:03:52] <%Stormeflame> @Stormeflame i def got it from work cause im a cashier at a grocery store so that sucks, called in today cause i wasnt feeling well they told me to keep em posted and took a covid test on a hunch and tested positive and had to call back and tell em
[2022-12-10 09:04:08] <!%$RickAltair> @Stormeflame I feel I would reach the "TOO" part.  I mean, maybe other VStreamers I talk to would think differently, but I feel I personally would.  Some poeple in chat do get on my nerves.  Also, I hardly have free time to be a decent mod.  I lurk most of the time.

[2022-12-10 09:05:09] <%Stormeflame> honestly lurking mods are the scariest cause peeps come in like ha theres no mods and boom banned before the streamer knows what happened lol

[2022-12-10 09:05:31] <!%$RickAltair> @TheKneeCapKnabber I think you make an awesome mod so far.  I was cheering you on even when I was predicting you would be one when you put the extra effort counting donos and such during the last special event.  Dunno if you were in talks with it before hand, but that effort is what makes a great mod.
[2022-12-10 09:06:33] <!%$RickAltair> @Stormeflame I guess that's true.  Maybe one day I'll change my mind, but as of now I still feel I'd suck as a mad and might be more harmful than good.  Maybe it depends on the streamer's personality and what they like as well.
[2022-12-10 09:06:37] <%Stormeflame> i think all Cerise's mods do an amazing job, some of the best mods ive seen on twitch are here
[2022-12-10 09:06:51] <!%$RickAltair> @Memil03 yokaiHey yokaiHey
[2022-12-10 09:08:05] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> The order today is Me, Stormflame, Galondir, Rick, then Memil yokaiMemo
[2022-12-10 09:08:35] <%Stormeflame> i was here like 3hrs ago how early did you get here lol
[2022-12-10 09:09:30] <!%$RickAltair> Anyway, even though work is light I still have a thing or two to do.  Let me take my long ass paragraphs and put them on my work docs.  I'll be back during stream at some point (hopefully).
[2022-12-10 09:09:52] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> Correction, the order today is Stormflame, me,  Galondir, Rick, then Memil yokaiMemo
[2022-12-10 09:10:08] <%Stormeflame> kk Rick! be safe, hopefully work goes fast
[2022-12-10 09:11:01] <%Stormeflame> i mean you can have it Knee while i was technically here 3 hrs ago i passed tf out cause of my fever till recently lol
[2022-12-10 09:12:56] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> I just didn't see any messages before mine so I looked at the chat history
[2022-12-10 09:13:12] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> when you said something
[2022-12-10 09:13:21] <%Stormeflame> fair enough lol ice cream is saving me so hard lol
[2022-12-10 09:14:02] <%Stormeflame> the cold is really helping keep my internal temp down, -12/10 do not reccomend covid
[2022-12-10 09:14:29] <@%TheKneeCapKnabber> don't over do it Storme
[2022-12-10 09:15:43] <%Stormeflame> ill be alright ty, im not eating a ton of it but it is helping, my work sells gallons of ice cream for like $7 so i bought some on wendsday and its come in clutch lol i can only take so much meds and they dont work the whole 6hrs i have to wait between doses
[2022-12-10 09:16:36] <!%+Galondir> zumivtPATPAT kuromiyaHeadpat Get well soon

[2022-12-10 10:34:49] <%+khMagnus2010> water down version of how we got stuff like ogryns: Way back in the past humans were super high tech and lived all over the galaxy (turn every world into a paradise level tech). Big lore event happened and human tech failed, planets got isolated and everything degraded to dark age tech. on certain planets people were forced to adapt to a climates their tech couldnt keep them safe from anymore. by the time empire reunited with those planets, the people had evolved into stuff like ogryns.
[2022-12-10 10:35:07] <gorgion> good luck in your games i will be lurking becorse i am going too do some darktide to @CeriseVT

[2022-12-10 10:36:40] <$sircool099> yeah, the definition of what the Imperium deems mutant and human vary greatly more on how useful they can be. I'm pretty sure there's a planet of cat-humans. And no, not the anime cute kind of that type

[2022-12-10 10:39:16] <%+khMagnus2010> there are a lot of abhumans. ogryns, ratlings, beastmen, squats, nightsiders, goliaths, etc. some are old lore and kinda fell off the map though
[2022-12-10 10:39:16] <Sylariusz> @LT_Jakal ngl - sounds like Borscht LuL
[2022-12-10 10:39:21] <%GarmrUSAF> to put the abhumans in normal person terms, an abhuman is an evolution that can maintain itself

[2022-12-10 10:40:45] <@%kogaYis> Borscht is a east european dish, yea
[2022-12-10 10:40:59] <@%LT_Jakal> I thought it was a soup or stew, glad I wasn't too far off mark
[2022-12-10 10:41:03] <@%kogaYis> iirc it's kind of a stew with beetroot
[2022-12-10 10:41:09] <Sylariusz> it is. just dont forget to add sour cream when you dish it :)

[2022-12-10 10:41:50] <Sylariusz> i mean it works without the sour cream - it just adds a BIG taste boost

[2022-12-10 11:14:40] <%+hugz4genestealers> it depends more on player experience than character level

[2022-12-10 12:28:44] <%+hugz4genestealers> but that's not quite the same as being able to have a lobby code that anyone can search for and join

After he made him feel better, he told him he was amazed that such a small place had a doctor. He nodded and said: No One Expects the Spanish Inn Physican!
