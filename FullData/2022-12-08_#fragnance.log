[2022-12-08 20:31:36] <lablabi123> people will kiss your feet if you offer to tank for them
[2022-12-08 20:31:54] <lablabi123> and as soon as you pull 1 mob too much or too little the same people will hard flame you and tell you to kys
[2022-12-08 20:31:58] <lablabi123> but that is just the pug experience
[2022-12-08 20:32:15] <mookie163383> Interesting, is tanking a shit show like it was at the start of shadowlands where you had to kite everything?
