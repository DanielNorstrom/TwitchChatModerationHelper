[2022-12-09 15:40:53] <+Donnie_Refn> @MANvsGAME I never played an Armoured Core game and when I look at the gameplay I feel like I might bounce off of it. However, I thought the same about Souls games in the past and come on, that trailer was pure porn for me.
[2022-12-09 15:41:09] <+Rooseweld> Death stranding 2, best trailer of the show, so hyped for it
[2022-12-09 15:41:12] <%+FeedTheGeekz> I can tell, your eyes haven't woken up yet
[2022-12-09 15:41:27] <%Twichyrain> The Armored core trailer!!! i'd love to see some gameplay but we'll get there
[2022-12-09 15:41:32] <mysteryfingers> from software can make non souls like games?!
[2022-12-09 15:41:41] <%vixtlan> i watched some ac 2 gameplay, looks like slave zero

[2022-12-09 15:52:18] <%LuckyLouie33> wow, its been so that long since the last one? pre-dark souls 1?
[2022-12-09 15:52:21] <Appolyon2885> @DoubleNova Yes, inside of the 'core' and not the 'head'

[2022-12-09 16:01:21] <+DoubleNova> I'm surprised they are sticking with DS2. Did it sell that well?

[2022-12-09 16:02:05] <+Huntedspam> did you stream it?
[2022-12-09 16:02:16] <%+Marvelous_Miscreant> MAN as someone who has played both GOW R and ER do u feel ER winning was an upset?
[2022-12-09 16:02:16] <+NoCowardShit> Yeah I wasn't looking for a sequel at all, but I am excited about the gameplay concept. A giant air ship with a crane..
[2022-12-09 16:02:21] <+NoCowardShit> Could he being his take on base management?
[2022-12-09 16:02:23] <@%Knives112> I'm ready for more metaphorical kojima jacking off on himself
[2022-12-09 16:02:27] <%+REVerend814> i absolutely loved it. I'm surprised that I loved it like it never seemed like something i'd dig but wow. and my wife being pregnant at the time made the story REALLY hit me
[2022-12-09 16:02:28] <+ordained_existence> did you see the bill clinton kid?
[2022-12-09 16:02:32] <%Omgeddon> Death Stranding 2, it's going to pplay like Crazy Taxi Kappa
[2022-12-09 16:02:32] <+Avetarx> Norman Fetus 2: Electric Boogaloo
[2022-12-09 16:02:44] <@%Knives112> while he talks about connections and being one
[2022-12-09 16:02:49] <%RetrODavid> I agree
[2022-12-09 16:02:51] <%+REVerend814> elden ring had it hands down
[2022-12-09 16:02:53] <+Huntedspam> elden ring brought so many to the genre
[2022-12-09 16:02:59] <@%Knives112> while troy baker plays his douchey self made guitar
[2022-12-09 16:03:11] <NickonJTV> So did Elden Ring though
[2022-12-09 16:03:14] <%+Marvelous_Miscreant> Cool. I just wanted to hear ur GOTY :)
[2022-12-09 16:03:28] <%UncleVicko> God of war won 6 awards  and Elden Ring won 4 awards atpGood
[2022-12-09 16:03:31] <Tajjen> I agree, i really wish they made two games instead
[2022-12-09 16:03:31] <%+finitek> GoW is a story you play, you cant really moss anything important.
[2022-12-09 16:03:36] <%+REVerend814> i cannot see open world games the same way because of elden ring. it did it that well
[2022-12-09 16:03:40] <Taz_RB> the puzzle backseating soured a bit of the experience with GOWR
[2022-12-09 16:03:48] <+Maradum> GoW is a great single player experience, but Elden Ring felt like sth truly special most of the time, one of a kind open world game
[2022-12-09 16:03:53] <%+Marvelous_Miscreant> ER’s PvP is the main sore spot for me and nerfing hammers was kinda dumb yesterday
[2022-12-09 16:03:54] <NickonJTV> Performance was pretty poor and plenty of reused bosses that killed the initial encounter magic were the big downsides for Elden Ring, at least for me

[2022-12-09 16:04:27] <+One_Eye> Exactly, I've paused my playthrough because of the backseating, I was getting too angry
[2022-12-09 16:04:37] <%+finitek> they gave themselves an award for backseating players and called it "accessibility"
[2022-12-09 16:04:40] <%vixtlan> companion help was considered accessibility in the awards, amazing

[2022-12-09 16:06:38] <%MotleyGuts> The achievements for Elden Ring reflected that as well, not demanding complete collections
[2022-12-09 16:06:44] <%Omgeddon> Animal was the best part of the show :)

[2022-12-09 17:03:10] <Strife24821> I don't want to play Gotham Knights either but it seems like some of the storylines are cool and I wish I could experience them without the game
[2022-12-09 17:03:21] <%jeanlemaingre> the original batman arkham games are so much better than gotham knights, that's why the price dropped s ofast
[2022-12-09 17:03:33] <+TheDomainGPCE> Gonna be sad that Kevin Conroy last appearance as Batman will be the Suicide Squad game.

[2022-12-09 17:47:05] <Simmonds91> @timeismoney2004 perfect? Backseating so bad even fans saying it's bad begs to differ

[2022-12-09 17:47:19] <%timeismoney2004> what is backseating?
[2022-12-09 17:47:24] <@%+Anubis169> !r1
[2022-12-09 17:47:24] <@%MANdroid> Rule #1 - NO BACKSEAT GAMING! This means tips, hints on what is currently or about to happen, guesses, or suggestions on what to do in the game. Any questions MAN asks are him thinking aloud, not asking for advice. If MAN actually wants advice, he will make it VERY clear.
[2022-12-09 17:47:24] <@%+Anubis169> ^ that

[2022-12-09 17:47:47] <Appolyon2885> @daardees_ Most Final Fantasy games are not connected by story.  There are references, similar items, but each is it's own world, it's own story.  Except for FFXII being in Ivalice like Tactics.

[2022-12-09 17:48:13] <%jeanlemaingre> true, all of the final fantasy games I've played so far took place in their own universe. Final fantasy XVI seems to be the same way PogU

[2022-12-09 17:48:26] <@%+Anubis169> somebody who tells the driver they're doing it all wrong, how to drive, without actually doing it themselves
[2022-12-09 17:48:35] <%timeismoney2004> did I backseat?

[2022-12-09 17:48:44] <%daardees_> so that Armored Core has a lot of freedom concerning the lore

[2022-12-09 17:49:20] <Appolyon2885> There is continuity with Armored Core 1 - Armored Core 2: Another Age.  Then 3 starts new and follows through to Last Raven.  4 connects to For Answer and 5 to Verdict Day.

[2022-12-09 17:51:21] <Appolyon2885> As a massive Armored Core fan I will also say that the story doesn't exactly pop.  Sometimes the continuity seems to make a leap as well as it did between Silent Line: Armored Core and Armored Core: Nexus.
[2022-12-09 17:52:20] <+tapper102> those headphones, that's the old school Bose soundsport, right? best headphones I've owned
[2022-12-09 17:52:22] <Appolyon2885> Armored Core 4 and For Answer got better but really it's individual missions being more interesting than the overall plot.

[2022-12-09 17:54:16] <Appolyon2885> I would imagine that one of the things that Armored Core 6 will improve on is story delivery.  It's a low bar though for AC.

[2022-12-09 18:05:01] <@%ExcessiveProfanity> Yeah finished that last night, both PSP games are fucking awesome. Really flesh out Kratos' background and while they lack the lovely puzzle design of the main series they have basically everything else you'd expect in spades.
[2022-12-09 18:05:08] <+DevilMayChris> GoW3 about halfway through the game get real uncomfortable. I was just playing but the whole time I just thinking I can't even support Kratos anything. He was just indiscriminately killing.
