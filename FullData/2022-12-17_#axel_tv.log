[2022-12-17 15:23:15] <paym4n> I wish we could get a subscription based game plateform. You pay monthly and you can DL and play games instead of buying a bunch
[2022-12-17 15:23:16] <%Yuki_Duki> i dont like subscription based games, because in third world countries we dont get access to online payments that often or that good of an economy @Axel_tv

[2022-12-17 15:23:28] <%Yuki_Duki> FF14 is good, but whats holding it IS the subscription based model

[2022-12-17 17:48:14] <%Qweets> @dirtygrunt0311 they do events every day leading up to wipe
[2022-12-17 17:48:14] <+DankMemesBlazer> the only thing that really kills me in this game is the constant "Strength Training/Endurance training"  .the tedious of grind  makes me cringe every wipe that i stop playing outright and went to single player tarkov not giving a fuck anymore
[2022-12-17 17:48:16] <+masonjarbogast> I'm loving the lobbies right now.
[2022-12-17 17:48:27] <+dirtygrunt0311> @Qweets so whats the event today??
