[2022-12-15 23:41:59] <Kiav> Sounds like this ship could use a couple of speed holes, nothing a powder keg couldn't help solve :)

[2022-12-15 23:57:35] <%Cliptons> ARI
[2022-12-15 23:57:39] <%noremann> professionally, Dandy, you never touch the anchor, unless it's an enemy ship's
[2022-12-15 23:57:40] <%Cliptons> you were in my top 4
[2022-12-15 23:57:50] <%noremann> anchoring is a waste of time and dangerous in certain situations

[2022-12-15 23:58:42] <%noremann> I was talking to Dandy D:
[2022-12-15 23:59:02] <%noremann> I reserve the right to bully my streamer D:
[2022-12-15 23:59:17] <%Finland_Jami> ari is going mad with power
[2022-12-15 23:59:38] <%noremann> that's because you don't stream almost 24/7
[2022-12-15 23:59:44] <%noremann> unlike that other one!
