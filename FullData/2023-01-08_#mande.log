[2023-01-08 09:14:44] <%asianpeppa> YES yes but it doesn't mean that you can sit like a fking melted butter
[2023-01-08 09:15:03] <%asianpeppa> YES you still need to mantain a good posture while sitting on it
[2023-01-08 09:15:35] <%asianpeppa> but when I got my ergo chair I don't feel the need to use it anymore

[2023-01-08 09:15:54] <%DDrevz> mandePosture
[2023-01-08 09:16:03] <%asianpeppa> PepeLa same, I have scoliosis too
[2023-01-08 09:16:06] <%zebotree> but i can't afford a fancy ass chair with ergonomics and shit
[2023-01-08 09:16:35] <%asianpeppa> mandeExplaining but the good thing bout it though even if you're pressing on your tailbone the eggseater cushions/support it
[2023-01-08 09:17:03] <%asianpeppa> DonkiLostHisClothes mine is really not that expensive but idk if you can get it since you're from EU
[2023-01-08 09:17:03] <%zebotree> better then sitting on two memoryfoam pillows i guess
[2023-01-08 09:17:21] <%zebotree> can get one for $20-40 bucks
[2023-01-08 09:17:23] <%asianpeppa> BRUHMM i think mine costs like $300 or some shid
[2023-01-08 09:17:43] <%asianpeppa> Hmm true, yea then get the egg seater
[2023-01-08 09:18:56] <%zebotree> Hmm maybe ill have a look around and see if it's an actuall orthopedic produc and maybe my insurance company can pay for a "real propper" one
[2023-01-08 09:19:18] <%asianpeppa> YES that's a good idea
[2023-01-08 09:19:33] <%asianpeppa> YEAHBUT7TV injuring your tailbone is a no beuno
[2023-01-08 09:19:49] <%asianpeppa> YEAHBUT7TV this is why good ergo chair, motorized desk are so fking expensive
[2023-01-08 09:20:09] <%zebotree> but they are dumb as shit, refused to help me with my car insruance for $30/month and would rather pay for a busspas for $100/month fucking dumb asses
[2023-01-08 09:21:27] <%asianpeppa> Hmm I did get lucky with my car insurance then
[2023-01-08 09:21:45] <%asianpeppa> i had my car for a week then this idiot decides to cut me off and hit my side mirror
[2023-01-08 09:21:56] <%asianpeppa> usually car insurance will ask you to take it Ford for example
[2023-01-08 09:22:33] <%asianpeppa> but instead since they know how shid ford when it comes to replacment and insurance they instead look for an 3rdparty car mechanic that can get me a part and they can cover the whole costs
[2023-01-08 09:22:37] <%asianpeppa> they did everything for me
[2023-01-08 09:23:23] <%zebotree> ah ye i was asking for the goverment mandated insurance that cover any costs incase i injure someone
[2023-01-08 09:23:42] <%asianpeppa> DonkiLostHisClothes oh gov insurnace
[2023-01-08 09:23:54] <%zebotree> the additional to cover my expenses if my car breaks i would pay myself
[2023-01-08 09:24:21] <%asianpeppa> DonkiLostHisClothes yea we call that participation fee
[2023-01-08 09:24:44] <%zebotree> the insurnace isn't goverment, but they requier you to have a basic insurance
[2023-01-08 09:25:25] <%asianpeppa> Hmm i see...
[2023-01-08 09:25:48] <%zebotree> but i got a real good deal, for $300/year fully covered
[2023-01-08 09:26:08] <%asianpeppa> LETSPEPE time to order a herman miller
[2023-01-08 09:26:12] <%zebotree> even if i fucked up and backed into a lamppost
[2023-01-08 09:26:36] <%zebotree> it would be a $100 selfrisk pay but anything above that would be covered
[2023-01-08 09:26:59] <%asianpeppa> it's so nice having good policy insurance
[2023-01-08 09:27:19] <%asianpeppa> you hardly see people from PH that actually insure their car and property idk why
[2023-01-08 09:28:20] <%zebotree> ye thats weird, car or home breaks. ya fuicked
