[2022-12-06 05:04:06] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/

[2022-12-06 08:51:59] <hahaimadecoy> when it comes to health care it's better and faster in the US but cost allot where as in Canada it's free (taxes) but can be worse quality and slower

[2022-12-06 09:47:27] <@%kdlutz> i used to speedrun getting over it
[2022-12-06 09:47:33] <+dragoflare234> I feel the same about there being too much difficulty sometimes

[2022-12-06 09:47:48] <@%kdlutz> my shortest time was 6 mins, so i was crappy as a speedrunner but better than the avg person
[2022-12-06 09:47:50] <+dragoflare234> like I want to enjoy the game not feel like I'm working
[2022-12-06 09:47:57] <@%syckbrs> love cuphead @awkward_emma
[2022-12-06 09:47:57] <jamesikarus> i've just done watching S2 of The Cup Head Show lol
[2022-12-06 09:48:05] <@%syckbrs> @kdlutz that's still cracked
[2022-12-06 09:48:07] <awkward_emma> I love Cuphead tho because of the art style
[2022-12-06 09:48:08] <hahaimadecoy> theres a nudity filter you can turn on in the settings
[2022-12-06 09:48:16] <PixelSkullTank> Sekiro is real hard, game will force you to play specifc ways to get through

[2022-12-06 09:48:31] <+dragoflare234> there are a lot of strategy survival games that look really fun and are, but then the resource management becomes so tedious I lose interest
[2022-12-06 09:48:35] <awkward_emma> @hahaimadecoy  oh ok ty for the info
[2022-12-06 09:48:36] <!%라우키스 (raukisu)> ooohhh ear tickles...

[2022-12-06 09:48:50] <%+fps_wolf22> i try to stray from souls games or just frustrating games, I just  want to enjoy the game as I play
[2022-12-06 09:48:50] <@%kdlutz> @PixelSkullTank exactly this. I thing thats why many soulds players dont like it. you NEED to use a specific playstyle

[2022-12-06 09:49:59] <awkward_emma> I would play call of duty on stream but the cod community is toxic from my experience
[2022-12-06 09:50:04] <+vexpug> @kdlutz XCOM 2?? Really? I didn't take that game for a rage inducing game. I've not played it yet
[2022-12-06 09:50:18] <+vexpug> @awkward_emma Just mute the lobby haha
[2022-12-06 09:50:22] <kinzowo> it was cozy the first hour
[2022-12-06 09:50:22] <+vexpug> That's what I do
[2022-12-06 09:50:23] <+dragoflare234> I rage quit potionomics
[2022-12-06 09:50:28] <kinzowo> then it stressed me the heck out
[2022-12-06 09:50:50] <@%kdlutz> @kdlutz especially on the highest difficulties and with the DLC, it REALLY stacks it against you. Sometimes a series of events will happen and your whole squad of your best dudes will get wiped
[2022-12-06 09:50:59] <+dragoflare234> it was so fun, but so stressful I stopped after the first 3 bosses
[2022-12-06 09:50:59] <awkward_emma> @vexpug  I'm talking about if people from the fan base watch

[2022-12-06 09:51:08] <+vexpug> Ahh I see
[2022-12-06 09:51:09] <%+fps_wolf22> my next game is honestly probably final fantasy 7 remake part 2 when it releases
[2022-12-06 09:51:10] <+vexpug> Fair enough
[2022-12-06 09:51:15] <funnydevilguy> lurker OOOUUT!!!
[2022-12-06 09:51:31] <+vexpug> I don't remember the last game that REALLY made me rage or quit lol
[2022-12-06 09:51:40] <@%kdlutz> its ok birdiebBirbpat
[2022-12-06 09:51:50] <@%kdlutz> there are also games that make me sadquit
[2022-12-06 09:51:50] <@%syckbrs> potionomics definitely seems like a multiple route game
[2022-12-06 09:51:52] <+vexpug> Spongies!!!!
[2022-12-06 09:52:08] <+dragoflare234> I would somehow pull a last minute potion out of my ass 3 times and win the fight; just didn't have the energy to do it a 4 times
