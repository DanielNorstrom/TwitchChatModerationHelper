[2022-12-18 23:03:29] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.

[2022-12-18 23:30:47] <meteospasmyl> is it worth crafting this deck ?
[2022-12-18 23:31:12] <nelluss> Ah by foot ok i understood, thank you for explanation
[2022-12-18 23:31:25] <rayquinox> F'd in the b
[2022-12-18 23:32:23] <5ftHax> he runs sigil :/
[2022-12-18 23:32:24] <%rexmkh> interesting. he actually runs that rune
[2022-12-18 23:32:30] <%rexmkh> anti dr rogue tech
[2022-12-18 23:32:46] <5ftHax> raguzzoni runs alot of tech in this deck
[2022-12-18 23:32:56] <5ftHax> its more for priest then rogue
[2022-12-18 23:33:08] <SnorkyARC> Streamer what do you think about latest vS report?
[2022-12-18 23:33:19] <%rexmkh> i started running royal librarian rather viper in my quest dh and it has already got a lot of value
[2022-12-18 23:33:39] <@%lass_leah> they cut spirit guides WTFF
[2022-12-18 23:33:56] <@%lass_leah> they cut one of the best Priest cards printed in a long time WTFF

[2022-12-18 23:34:39] <5ftHax> librarian might just be better then viper depends how much miracle vs dr or priest you see
[2022-12-18 23:34:50] <@%lass_leah> how does the deck draw without spirit guides?
[2022-12-18 23:35:09] <+kriscitoo> @SmokinWiseMysticalTrees Which emotion do you think represents that beauty the most ?
[2022-12-18 23:35:10] <+jewelsftw> @lass_leah You draw 1 card at the start of every turn :) Kappa
[2022-12-18 23:35:18] <%rexmkh> @5ftHax i haven't seen any miracle rogues at my rank
[2022-12-18 23:35:34] <@%lass_leah> @jewelsftw that sounds awful, imagine drawing 1 card per turn
[2022-12-18 23:35:45] <5ftHax> tbf you also just beat miracle unless you somehow dont get your heal
[2022-12-18 23:36:09] <%rexmkh> yeah
[2022-12-18 23:36:20] <5ftHax> unless yuo hit the random controll pally
[2022-12-18 23:36:34] <5ftHax> then youre upset about cariel
[2022-12-18 23:37:02] <5ftHax> they milled reward too so they can discount traders
[2022-12-18 23:37:57] <+orphanari> ive got 4 hours to kill and I am at d5 what deck do you think I should use tonight to get to legend. ive heard rush warrior is good.
[2022-12-18 23:38:20] <@%lass_leah> Aggro pally is apparently good
[2022-12-18 23:38:26] <@%lass_leah> I haven't personally tried it
[2022-12-18 23:38:27] <viniloico722> !bestdeck EZ
[2022-12-18 23:38:27] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-18 23:38:35] <+orphanari> FUCK your right
[2022-12-18 23:38:55] <+drop_table_subs> Short stream? Glad i got here 15 min in

[2022-12-18 23:47:03] <SpykoNukov> whirlpool would kill half of their wincon I guess

[2022-12-18 23:47:36] <SpykoNukov> yeah that's fair, that's why you're the top legend :)
[2022-12-18 23:48:00] <khuchten> Normally i get unlucky too we have so much in common Kappa
[2022-12-18 23:48:05] <+DraganDE> Chat, does anyone have a good deck to climb to legend? This month I find it unusually hard going 50% on everything
[2022-12-18 23:48:17] <OurYoungHero> Could add Leper Gnome to this deck for a POWERFUL deathrattle to copy with Xyrella
[2022-12-18 23:48:47] <%rexmkh> that dh deck almost seemed too greedy and dispersed
[2022-12-18 23:49:11] <grimBleeper> Okayge you don't need to be good to make the final push to legend, just go on a 15 game winstreak after waking up
[2022-12-18 23:49:18] <OurYoungHero> Also could mean you are going to win your next 4 games Kappa
[2022-12-18 23:50:00] <khuchten> 4Head
[2022-12-18 23:50:08] <+ucdchris1> no Kappa ill stick with my murloc mage
[2022-12-18 23:50:11] <viniloico722> 5Head
[2022-12-18 23:50:17] <%+kakademona87> @grimBleeper thats how I got legend for the first time :D
[2022-12-18 23:50:40] <5ftHax> def a quest dh
[2022-12-18 23:50:57] <ThisSilhouetteLie> overexplaining roasting edition, nice
[2022-12-18 23:51:01] <+orphanari> You answered my question on getting good! SO just pure reps and reflection on a deck with a decent win rate?
[2022-12-18 23:51:05] <BlaskLight1> my first legend was galakrond warlock
[2022-12-18 23:51:08] <BlaskLight1> it was great
[2022-12-18 23:51:38] <grimBleeper> @orphanari identify key combos or plays that your deck is built around, that's something that can be done with reps and reflection
[2022-12-18 23:51:44] <sawyerknight417> Mine was with Scholomance weapon rogue
[2022-12-18 23:51:45] <bigbaguette_69> yo nhg did you test quest dh. thoughts ?
[2022-12-18 23:51:49] <sawyerknight417> A JAlex special
[2022-12-18 23:52:08] <OurYoungHero> My first legend was Mukla rogue I think lol
[2022-12-18 23:52:16] <OurYoungHero> Backspace Rogue
[2022-12-18 23:52:16] <sawyerknight417> My peak legend in standard was with weapon rogue and Highlander galakrond rogue
[2022-12-18 23:52:22] <gnurrgard> my first legend was patron warrior FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-18 23:52:28] <sawyerknight417> Fast 44s list
[2022-12-18 23:52:31] <5ftHax> i kind like odds
[2022-12-18 23:52:34] <SpykoNukov> ruin for the ghost ? ig they play it
[2022-12-18 23:52:42] <sawyerknight417> I started playing in KoFT
[2022-12-18 23:53:17] <OurYoungHero> If you win as a rogue that never reveals you are a rogue, which class gets the credit for the win?
[2022-12-18 23:53:56] <5ftHax> you could test that in solo play
[2022-12-18 23:54:07] <5ftHax> just put maestra and all nuetrals in practice
[2022-12-18 23:54:15] <sawyerknight417> So there’s a bunch of miracle rogue lists out there. Some with Potionmaster. Some with Edwin. Some with neither. I am using Posesi’s list at the moment, so you think that’s a good list?
[2022-12-18 23:54:19] <%+saa_soli> @OurYoungHero should be that class. people have gotten credit for 500 wins with ragnaros for example
[2022-12-18 23:54:20] <OurYoungHero> I imagine its the non-rogue class
[2022-12-18 23:54:39] <%+Razorbam> Hi everyone! As you know, I'm french so please be cool with me... ahahah
[2022-12-18 23:54:43] <khuchten> imagine having watchpost as dad
[2022-12-18 23:54:45] <5ftHax> yeah but rag isnt considered a class tho unlike maestra
[2022-12-18 23:55:14] <sawyerknight417> Messi went goblin mode ngl
[2022-12-18 23:55:20] <%loganhound> France had a tough day
[2022-12-18 23:55:21] <SpykoNukov> french should be bash, source: je suis français

[2022-12-18 23:55:50] <+ucdchris1> i heard that if visions gets counterspelled it goes away
[2022-12-18 23:56:12] <%+Razorbam> Yes, tough day x)
[2022-12-18 23:56:25] <%+Citybuilder45> I won 7 in a row with this deck today
[2022-12-18 23:56:26] <%loganhound> Great match
[2022-12-18 23:56:34] <%+Citybuilder45> It truly is unstoppable
[2022-12-18 23:56:52] <gravitas3k> were the changes the 2 pelicans for Astalor and Bonecaller?
[2022-12-18 23:56:56] <%$MaGiiCaL_FuSiiOnZz> Egg would be too valuable to waste on an objection Kappa
[2022-12-18 23:57:08] <sawyerknight417> Never objection… thoughts?
[2022-12-18 23:57:10] <+ucdchris1> do u ever go lightshower there in case u need to weave hp?
[2022-12-18 23:57:18] <+GeneralKust0> :(((

[2022-12-18 23:57:44] <bigbaguette_69> then why is it always objection ?
[2022-12-18 23:57:58] <%+Citybuilder45> EZ

[2022-12-18 23:58:12] <%+Razorbam> I want to play my best DH against argentin players Kappa solaryhsFR
[2022-12-18 23:58:16] <+GeneralKust0> pessimism not always bad thinking sometimes its preparing yourself for the worst...
[2022-12-18 23:58:26] <SnorkyARC> When I started playing the priest, I long stopped believing in the hope
[2022-12-18 23:58:27] <5ftHax> welp now he knows its gigafin :)
