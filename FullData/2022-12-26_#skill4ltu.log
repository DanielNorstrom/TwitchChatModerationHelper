[2022-12-26 00:18:47] <%Thorkell_the_great> BZ is weak. Does not have enough hp for a tier 9 tank.
[2022-12-26 00:18:49] <akosmakos_> @szpejda try it under the turret, and you should be able to pen the cupola too... have you checked any 3D armour model of it?

[2022-12-26 00:18:54] <%+ExploziveAF> They already removed the derp guns on the new Chinese line because the BZ is so strong with it
[2022-12-26 00:18:57] <%KloverKong> i actually got so tired of bz earlier that i actually jumped into arta just to focus fire them

[2022-12-26 00:26:23] <%+GinValid> @zebski stock Ferdinand grind made me rage sell the tank back in 2014, can't even imagine how shit of a grind it is in 2022
[2022-12-26 00:26:27] <Mr_Skankan> bz or vz ?
[2022-12-26 00:26:27] <%mikeyg_1982> trying to 1st mark 1st tank ts-5 is making me question life in general!
[2022-12-26 00:26:29] <%mateoopl124> I agree with you - I don't like playing VIII tier now but currently it's beneficial to grind credits @skill4ltu
[2022-12-26 00:26:35] <el_traficante92> what is that golden statue in the back?
[2022-12-26 00:26:43] <@%Basleader92> @chirop_ that's just words from players though, as long as you have no proof from WG sharing such things you can't know for sure... Not saying that I don't agree with you, because it DOES look like it sometimes, but I also don't fully believe it because there's no proof

[2022-12-26 15:56:25] <%Great_Briton> @VATO__GEO I used to smoke and then I found out the after effect pushes you down, and then the cig pushes you back up, but nto as much as the down, so after a short while you are smoking to take the 'down' away, i.e. feel normal.

[2022-12-26 16:46:23] <+mohk96g> @skill4ltu it is a problem because they raise different marks (eg 3rd mark)

[2022-12-26 18:01:54] <%+Reavus1> @doruvasilepuscas OH, good to know. I have only played CS:GO for like 2 hours with my sons and their friends.
[2022-12-26 18:01:57] <kunigasrajone> @skill4ltu  whats ur opinion about dez video about new bz's? į think its too op
[2022-12-26 18:01:57] <Lexa4RU> Nevermind, I just was unlucky (or because I didn't had full gold) but now my guard can hit things @skill4ltu
[2022-12-26 18:01:57] <%+axerodas> @skill4ltu I want to know cause the math don't add up in the game how a weapon with 9,3 sec reload time with gun rammer that gives -10% in time gives -0,87 sec plus the  BIA skill 5% gives only -0,2 sec ! really can anyone solve this.
[2022-12-26 18:01:57] <+doruvasilepuscas> @Reavus1 yeah, you just go shoot some tanks and get out, no stats.

[2022-12-26 18:03:11] <%+Reavus1> BIA doesn't give 5% after the 10% of Rammer. They both reduce a percent of the base reload, same with food.

[2022-12-26 18:03:33] <+doruvasilepuscas> @MickeeyyMouse you are jumping too high, my "competitive" would be just normal random. But make a "casual" mode, so to redirect there people who just want to shoot some tanks for fun.
[2022-12-26 18:03:35] <skullament> I see the new videos on Youtube.. and u dont have runner gummer on first slot at version 4

[2022-12-26 18:03:55] <%+SovEren_PL> BIA give 5% to crew not to stat. 10% better loader does not mean 10% lower reload time. If it would be that you would have 0 sec reload at 100%

[2022-12-26 18:41:52] <%MiradaQ> @skill4ltu why 60TP "Epic" on index, if every component of it from horrible to good?

[2022-12-26 20:00:07] <%AliensComePeace> @skill4ltu is guard for bonds?
[2022-12-26 20:00:15] <@%momix99> yes @AliensComePeace
[2022-12-26 20:00:18] <%+DelHuge> I think it was buffed at the same time as CDC, T-34-3 and another one too.
[2022-12-26 20:00:21] <%kostasgam3r> u can take and complete 3 battles passes every season-each one gives u about 22-23 days premium-blueprints-3d camo for 3 tanks-plus bonds-and points to get your self a premium tank-and all of that for the cost of 7500gold at total
[2022-12-26 20:00:42] <antonis360r> is Is-6 woth buying with bonds???
[2022-12-26 20:01:01] <@%+evofrogmr> @antonis360r you can check !bonds, but I would say no
[2022-12-26 20:01:09] <Betzer> At what tier should I start transfering my crew to the next tank? From tier 7 to tier 8?

[2022-12-26 20:01:43] <Archduke__> @antonis360r there's a video in Skill's YT about all tanks available in bond store, that's pretty informative
[2022-12-26 20:01:54] <@%+evofrogmr> @Betzer you definitely want to have a good crew starting in level 8.  are you playing for free?
[2022-12-26 20:02:07] <@%+evofrogmr> !bonds
[2022-12-26 20:02:07] <@^StreamElements> Don't know which is the best tank to get with bonds? Look no further because Skill got you covered! youtu.be/3pM3Py_lkqU (June 2022)

[2022-12-26 20:02:31] <Kavakcz> @skill4ltu skiiil, aftrer coming back as an oldschool player, my goal was to mark the VK28.01. And now I did it, after bouncing a few times from 94 to 92%

[2022-12-26 20:03:51] <Kavakcz> gold tank!
[2022-12-26 20:04:10] <i_c_u_pking> get that 3rd mark already sheesh
[2022-12-26 20:04:17] <@%+evofrogmr> @Betzer if you don't want to spend the gold to retrain, and still have them be 100% in new tank, you can reset their skills to 90% for silver, then put them in the new tank and retrain them for silver.  Some of the un-used crew xp from the reset will cover the 90% up to 100% main skill... but if you have multple skills on the crew, you can just retrain for silver and grind back the 90 to 100% on the crew.  Just options to consider without gold
[2022-12-26 20:04:20] <smile8xd> @antonis360r I am using Guard as sniper if I am not top Tier :D

[2022-12-26 20:41:56] <%+bekerowski11> @skill4ltu i watched a streamer, dont say his name, but he showed you the dominance of OLAF ;) he said 40% games you win without doing something, 40% of games you lose and you can sweet your ass of and 20 % you are the player wich can make the diefference, will you agree in this theorie? i think it sounds logic ;)
[2022-12-26 20:42:02] <st4linium_rng> @skill4ltu we love to see you screaming when playing with a bad tanks i wish you Ankau commanders in every tank  Kappa

[2022-12-26 20:45:56] <gideon_an> It is kind of interesting when Wargaming balancing. With the FV 4005 they nerfed everything but the damage.
[2022-12-26 20:45:57] <%ulleb0y> Well there is impossible to balance a game completely
[2022-12-26 20:45:58] <SayUncle> Focus on the game

[2022-12-26 20:46:19] <%mjolnirsson> the rest is just noise
[2022-12-26 20:46:23] <@%+evofrogmr> @MrPipkis you can retrain to 100% using silver only if you reset the crew skills, you'll loose some of the crew skills (camo, repairs, ect) but then you can have a 100% base skill on transfer
[2022-12-26 20:46:36] <jov1c> what is more interesting to play , tvp or udes tier X chaattt and skiiiill

[2022-12-26 20:48:27] <gideon_an> The Type 5 Heavy needs a massive gun buff. The DPM is garbage with the normal gun.
[2022-12-26 20:48:48] <@%+evofrogmr> @MrPipkis you'll loose maybe 10% on the 4th skill if you do it all silver, but you'll be able to respec if you want, but since going from 90 to105, you probably dont want to respec
