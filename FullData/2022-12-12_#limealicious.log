[2022-12-12 00:00:05] <Karneolius> it's like a dining hall but for guilds
[2022-12-12 00:00:05] <Yleshphitrium> Guilds are similar to temples
[2022-12-12 00:00:05] <%artificiallynatural> oh shit did guilds get added back in?

[2022-12-12 00:02:29] <%zman12380> I said it before but phrased differently, but I love how suddenly the game shifted gears from "take you time nice and slowly :) " to "ALL OF THE MECHANICS NOW limesFine "
[2022-12-12 00:02:32] <desc3000> clown music for elves
[2022-12-12 00:02:33] <+JordanU> Elves cant even tell the difference between a tree and a fungus, screw em
[2022-12-12 00:02:35] <lumustechtips> are the elves making problems now?
[2022-12-12 00:02:46] <DatCorvus> elves only use wood armor and weapons which are barely better than fists. they make great punching bags
[2022-12-12 00:02:46] <7Artist> you can also find a cavern and get wood from there
[2022-12-12 00:02:51] <Fharli> Clown music is reserved for later

[2022-12-12 00:04:07] <%$earin_copper> At least in the ASCII version, the only thing you *had* to make out of wood is beds
[2022-12-12 00:04:15] <TheLasurLawrence> Rock pots = Barrels
[2022-12-12 00:04:18] <+JordanU> barrels can be made of iron

[2022-12-12 00:06:52] <%Tirien66> they speak to the trees to get the wood
[2022-12-12 00:06:53] <Jigglyritz> their stuff is grown
[2022-12-12 00:06:53] <%bunglinglummox> elven wood items are "ethically grown"
[2022-12-12 00:06:54] <DMPhobos> they grow wood into things
[2022-12-12 00:06:56] <%$peekas0> They don't chop the trees down to make stuff.

[2022-12-12 00:07:02] <%FieldMedic4077> they clearly use magic to take the wood without harming  the tree NODDERS
[2022-12-12 00:07:06] <Madame_Sophia> Actually, elves use magic to grow wood objects
[2022-12-12 00:07:08] <GoodJobDog> They don't cut down the trees, they grow their stuff
[2022-12-12 00:07:13] <sleepbeef> they only buy your wooden goods if you buy the wood from them.

[2022-12-12 00:08:57] <ughdontmakemeregister> marksdwarves can be good, its safer than fighting up close
[2022-12-12 00:09:02] <%+StridingPants> Crossbows are nice. Good cover fire for the melee troops
[2022-12-12 00:09:06] <ughdontmakemeregister> but melee guys with good armor are the best
[2022-12-12 00:09:06] <7Artist> you can make your own outfit for them, you can give them crossbows and iron

[2022-12-12 00:09:31] <%zman12380> Archers are good guards from what I understand both to fight some nasty stuff that you don't want to melee, and as guards since they won't accidently kill your dwarves if the need to use force
[2022-12-12 00:09:31] <$Weedle_Man> Melly
[2022-12-12 00:09:32] <$GoutetsuKame> a few ranged never hurt

[2022-12-12 00:09:34] <%$peekas0> archery is for cowards, real dwarves wrestle their enemies to death
[2022-12-12 00:09:43] <NotGoodatThis> How do i get my Marksdwarves to actually use bolts?
[2022-12-12 00:09:51] <%Dima3z> I get absolutely wrecked by agitated giant crows right now so it depends

[2022-12-12 00:10:08] <lumustechtips> @NotGoodatThis do they have quivers to carry their bolts
[2022-12-12 00:10:10] <+Exoltik> I find fortifications best when set up as towers accessible from a tunnel
[2022-12-12 00:10:17] <ughdontmakemeregister> silver warhammers and steel axes are the best, i think?

[2022-12-12 00:11:28] <ughdontmakemeregister> Steel requires charcoal (coke) and flux stone to make pig iron, then pig iron and more iron to make steel
[2022-12-12 00:11:29] <7Artist> and then you combine them to make steel
[2022-12-12 00:11:32] <ughdontmakemeregister> it is a multi step process

[2022-12-12 00:12:25] <%DesperateMeat> then you can make steel with iron and pig iron
[2022-12-12 00:12:26] <%TsunamiAromatic> Yes
[2022-12-12 00:12:27] <ughdontmakemeregister> So making steel here follows the actual process of making steel IRL, which is basically successive rounds of adding carbon to molten iron
[2022-12-12 00:12:28] <$meiramystery> pig iron is a real kind of iron
[2022-12-12 00:12:29] <+JordanU> you gotta select it first
[2022-12-12 00:12:33] <tordalor> yes
[2022-12-12 00:12:39] <%TsunamiAromatic> steel isn't important
[2022-12-12 00:12:41] <ughdontmakemeregister> iron is "good enough"
[2022-12-12 00:12:43] <lumustechtips> @TrueBlueRevue a kilogram of feathers because you have to life with the weight of all those dead birds
[2022-12-12 00:12:52] <%TsunamiAromatic> Steel is like bragging rights
[2022-12-12 00:12:54] <ughdontmakemeregister> steel is like the best, but iron armor and weapons are MUCH simpler to make and almost as good

[2022-12-12 01:29:53] <+Exoltik> You might find tribes down there. Also, forgotten beasts. I recommend having a drawbridge on hand to block it off in case of emergency
[2022-12-12 01:29:53] <!%Laimubot> the combat looks okay

[2022-12-12 01:30:19] <%Mortal_Quinn> there's a mod to make the fog black instead of blue

[2022-12-12 01:30:59] <SaverinM> Regular cave spiders aren't a threat. It's the giant ones you have to watch out for
[2022-12-12 01:31:00] <Qoph_Lynx> The small spiders are just vermin like rats and bugs.  they dont bite (much)
[2022-12-12 01:31:01] <arctangentX> tbh the first cavern layer isn't *that* bad
[2022-12-12 01:31:02] <bayronbunbun> he got too exited

[2022-12-12 01:32:57] <lumustechtips> it will grow on soil everywhere underground now and acts like grass on the surface

[2022-12-12 01:33:01] <arctangentX> because you broke in the cavern and released the spores, now cave plants can randomly grow in indoor soil. grazing animals can eat it the same as grass

[2022-12-12 01:33:45] <ululator> adventure mode is fun to see all the places it can generate, like goblin and dwarven fortresses. you can start your fortress on one too with a fighting team

[2022-12-12 19:44:29] <galepond> I stayed up late for Vinny and GreatSphynx until i passed out. I still haven't decided if i made a mistake or not.

[2022-12-12 19:49:15] <%MeleeTechie> Vinny has some pretty banger streams limesOk
[2022-12-12 19:51:16] <galepond> Indeed, the man has maintained a consistent quality even after all these years. This year's streams have especially been great after he stopped giving a damn, in general, especially about copyright and the BRBs with licensed songs made a return.
