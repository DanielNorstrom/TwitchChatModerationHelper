[2022-12-13 22:45:37] <%$Layzay73> @Auteru apparently you're modded in these channels and they've been live in the last 3 monthes "akkadian2009" "chillypanda" "erciiii" "ghost_kitsune" "mikematrix" "renadra" "skeeer"
[2022-12-13 22:45:43] <+xana19991> ateru wheeze was my top used emote 1607 times

[2022-12-13 22:49:05] <%Kiseng> the jacket looks kinda weird
[2022-12-13 22:49:23] <@%+Xp3fr> i thought it was hivemind jacket , black and orange Kappa
[2022-12-13 22:49:33] <+xana19991> @Layzay73  that's odd as the review was saying 2 channels and 22 hours modded

[2022-12-13 22:51:04] <%$Layzay73> @xana19991 for the Tool I use the channel needs to be live for atleast one time in the last 3 monthes
[2022-12-13 22:51:48] <%$Layzay73> @xana19991 but I think it might count your own channel and if you had a name change this year then that's another one aswell
