[2023-01-02 05:33:28] <%+Dumbass_Gremlin> Idk if you are trying to avoid like story based games but Imortal Fenyx Rising is a lot of fun if you havent checked it out. Its centered around Greek Mythos and has Prometheus and Zeus narrate with Prometheus calling zeus out constantly. very fun game.

[2023-01-02 05:34:10] <@%+carthage67> cheer100 Remnant doesn't play very much like a souls game. I'd honestly say it's more rogue-lite than souls-like. It's a 3rd person shooter, with the maps and bosses changing every time you go through it, bosses usually have 2 ways to kill them, giving a different weapon as a reward for each method

[2023-01-02 06:25:27] <%raigeki55> It is the same, but depending on which one you're fighting, it's gonna be tough. Giacomo's not THAT difficult since he's got pokemon in the 20s. The reason the pokemon in this area are low level are because this is a relatively low level area, and that applies to Giacomo too

[2023-01-02 10:52:22] <+KumoriRyuX> the frame drops in scarlet and violet is due to poor optimization and the switch being overclocked by the game
