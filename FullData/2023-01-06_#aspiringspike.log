[2023-01-06 17:17:11] <bugiardo007> I think ironically, not always yessing might open yourself up even more to a misclick. Accidentally clicking no for example

[2023-01-06 17:17:17] <%Alacrin7> You've probably answered this before, but is there a reason you prefer all mouse instead of using some keyboard commands? Seems like that would make these lines easier to go through rather than all the clicks.

[2023-01-06 17:35:25] <+Silver__Core> if the opponent only has 1 emrakul, its still deterministic anyways. eventually there will be a configuration when the emrakul is shuffled as the bottom card and will mill out first assuming they dont already have 7 cards in hand.
[2023-01-06 17:35:30] <$StompyRobo> @aspiringspike ever thought about teshar in this deck?

Again, the card I am suggesting you add is ragavan. Thank You.
[2023-01-06 17:37:27] <%+BaconBaker> I'm glad that with regeneration being phased out with "indestructible until end of turn", it's made regenerate more relevant against new removal spells. if brotherhoods end was printed more than a couple years ago it would have said can't be regenerated on it

[2023-01-06 17:56:05] <CannibalSammich> Spike I've been looking at this list for like fifteen minutes straight and I feel like I'm missing something. How do you plan on winning the game after you mill your library out with the combo? Did you forget to add Oracle to the list? Normally your brews are sick, but this one is definitely a miss in its current state. I am very intelligent.

[2023-01-06 18:07:19] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Bitter Reuinion. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Bitter Reuinion. Thank You.

[2023-01-06 18:33:32] <%+billiam1026> Hey spike, just noticed you were playing fetches, im assuming its for deck thinning and to alter top card for yur forges, But just thought of maybe 1 gingerbread cabin? it could be an untap for grinding station, but its probably  too deep and would cost you more in the early game.
[2023-01-06 18:33:35] <%youreinnate> you need some prop dough to toss
[2023-01-06 18:33:37] <armater> @esqpoe it's not the opponent slowing the game down, it's still you taking the same game actions over and over hoping it goes differently this time

[2023-01-06 19:25:27] <WondrousIdeals> @tenorca it's because it was a nice part of a lot of different decks, so banning it was a meta-shifting move, to weaken tron, artifact decks, eldrazi decks, whatever. banning it would have been for play reasons (sculpting a different format) rather than power level reasons

[2023-01-06 19:57:27] <+Quixoticcommand> Could any artifact deck be as dominant as KCI with all the new super efficient hate we have?
[2023-01-06 19:57:35] <@%+hmmyespanda> @motelmoxy it had to do with declaring a cast and having mana which would not be there cause oif a sac thing
[2023-01-06 19:57:45] <@%+hmmyespanda> so it was a weird ordering of cost i dont fully recall

[2023-01-06 20:00:02] <+motelmoxy> this deck at its strongest is probably the dredge of artifact decks. super poewrful and consistent but too easily disrupted
[2023-01-06 20:00:06] <+six_sigma_> why dont we just splash for white and play nevermore for Karns
[2023-01-06 20:00:07] <%d0gula> as good as jund at least

[2023-01-06 20:00:55] <+cazzaro17> Red splash was good in kci for galv blast and ghirapur aether grid. that could work here
[2023-01-06 20:01:09] <+TheGoldenHorncall> My brain is to small to understand what is going on here
[2023-01-06 20:01:11] <+motelmoxy> breach requires cutting the claw and cathodions win con i think

[2023-01-06 20:49:00] <%Goody_Phil> situations like this is where I feel like more sac outlets would help. instead of using the land you could have used retriever @aspiringspike

[2023-01-06 20:50:54] <%+Draken44> Do you think Blue over red for a burst option like Outcome or Tutor like Whir/Reshape could work?

[2023-01-06 20:50:55] <@%^MTGBot> There are a few combo options in Semblance Anvil Combo: 1) Semblance Anvil with an imprinted artifact, two Myr Retrievers and a Grinding Station mills your opponent out. 2) Generate infinite with Semblance Anvil, Scrap Trawler, Cathodian, a sac outlet and a Myr Retreiver.

[2023-01-06 20:52:34] <alexmacraemtg> I play teshar cedh. Why not play teshar over forge and splash white by cutting some forests for spire of industry? You could go -4 forge, +3 teshar, +1 something else, and you'd swap some lands

[2023-01-06 21:00:44] <+Shotcoder> how do you win vs one of the shuffle Eldrazis?
[2023-01-06 21:00:45] <%iceman012> @Koskadelli If I cast POT of GREED, do I LOSE the game twice?
[2023-01-06 21:00:45] <+MythDef> opponent is a good sport lmao
[2023-01-06 21:00:47] <jae_real> 1 of grapeshot 4 wincon Kappa
[2023-01-06 21:00:50] <%TM06Life> Would we ever consider adding 2-3 Forging the Anchor to this deck?  We can always get the blue from Star/Sphere and the possibility of getting 4-5 artifacts to refuel seems enormous in this deck
[2023-01-06 21:00:51] <!%+mkdalynn> Just remember to not bring cage in against Living End
[2023-01-06 21:00:59] <+Shadowx1799> yea i was only on the combo i blanked on forge
[2023-01-06 21:01:01] <+gwdinosaurs> i mean cage might be worth it even hitting forge just because it nukes yawgmoth so hard
[2023-01-06 21:01:04] <%+n3verknowsbest> Intentionally 61 NANI!
[2023-01-06 21:01:07] <%+TurnPikeBear> Does cage stop retriever?

[2023-01-06 21:01:10] <%Goody_Phil> It's cute that you guys traded turn 3 wins for games 1 and 2
[2023-01-06 21:01:14] <+MrDucktape> what does groove do that forest doesnt? sorry I didn't pay attention when you said it
[2023-01-06 21:01:17] <%+TurnPikeBear> !card graf  diggers

[2023-01-06 21:01:23] <Ebgish> would you ever consider intentional 69?
[2023-01-06 21:01:28] <%+MrCleverpig> have you considered cutting grinding station for 4 celestial colonnade so you can have a wincon?
[2023-01-06 21:01:33] <theallpowerfuldaniel> When do you board up to 61? @aspiringspike
[2023-01-06 21:01:35] <+bolander42> !decklist

[2023-01-06 21:02:25] <alexmacraemtg> we could play EE over needle. It hits w6, hammer time, rhinoes, and we can play itr for 2 with grove and stars
[2023-01-06 21:02:25] <%+scurtis9> Have you considered Snow-Covered Forest???
[2023-01-06 21:02:25] <%ValeckSeimu> BTW we are too much anvil dependet
[2023-01-06 21:02:25] <+Shadowx1799> i feel as if u wanted to draw that bad u would just play the stupid affinity thopter
[2023-01-06 21:02:25] <%maxwread> if someone asks the wincon just say Celestial Colonade
[2023-01-06 21:02:26] <@%redsevn> remember when people were talking about banning Ancient Stirring
[2023-01-06 21:02:26] <@%redsevn> pepperidge farm remembers
[2023-01-06 21:02:26] <+motelmoxy> drawing cards is not this decks problem lol
[2023-01-06 21:02:27] <%+TurnPikeBear> Add altar of the brood so opponent’s see a win con Kappa
[2023-01-06 21:02:29] <%+Koskadelli> Since you have an infinite mana loop with Cathodian, have you considered adding some blue mana and the card EXPANSION//EXPLOSION to your deck? You could even copy ancient stirrings occasionally!
[2023-01-06 21:02:32] <@%KeaneMind> we need the white board behind spike to show cards chat has suggested and why they are bad in this deck
[2023-01-06 21:02:32] <soleootb> ah ok, thanks for explanation
[2023-01-06 21:02:41] <+paulapolos> I love locket.
[2023-01-06 21:02:41] <+Jaredhtm> will say this deck does look sick spike
[2023-01-06 21:02:41] <Hourglasss> you should cut cath and mystic forge so you can put narcomeba, dread return and thassa's oracle to win after you mill both players to 0
[2023-01-06 21:02:47] <theallpowerfuldaniel> ty
[2023-01-06 21:02:59] <%Goody_Phil> they shocked
[2023-01-06 21:03:07] <+Shadowx1799> play stonebrain name yawg/ station on your op kekw
[2023-01-06 21:03:11] <%ValeckSeimu> noooo

[2023-01-06 21:03:16] <%Goody_Phil> They cast DRC, played stomping ground, cast drum
[2023-01-06 21:03:20] <%maxwread> green is the new storm and artifact color, nothing they wont give that color
[2023-01-06 21:03:36] <%iceman012> It's def a bluff Kappa
[2023-01-06 21:03:37] <%+sixthdeclension> sweet spell pierce check
[2023-01-06 21:03:38] <+Jaredhtm> opponent no

[2023-01-06 21:03:45] <@%^MTGBot> Spell Pierce, {U} | Instant | Counter target noncreature spell unless its controller pays {2}.
[2023-01-06 21:03:47] <%Goody_Phil> they only need an instant in yard
[2023-01-06 21:03:48] <+motelmoxy> i cast a blocker
[2023-01-06 21:03:50] <FearSide5> is that the cathodion art with the actual 3d model instead of traditional media?
[2023-01-06 21:03:51] <freedy1313> prof bluff
[2023-01-06 21:03:55] <%fourdeltavictor> you know what card would be sick in this deck? deadly dispute
[2023-01-06 21:03:58] <FearSide5> hell i think claws of gix is the same
[2023-01-06 21:04:07] <%ValeckSeimu> non creture??? sp suk
[2023-01-06 21:04:08] <DrW0rm> That would be an incredible bluff
[2023-01-06 21:04:10] <Ebgish> maybe it is ceremonial rejection?
[2023-01-06 21:04:15] <$SirfetchdTFT> that's some next level bluff
[2023-01-06 21:04:18] <@%KeaneMind> i wonder what opp's wincon here is?
[2023-01-06 21:04:47] <ichaivalrose> notege notege pretend to be a bit silly to win games notege
[2023-01-06 21:04:48] <%Goody_Phil> it wasn't a bluff chat
[2023-01-06 21:05:03] <FearSide5> yeah that cathodion is a cg model
[2023-01-06 21:05:03] <FearSide5> lol
[2023-01-06 21:05:08] <freedy1313> wouldn't expect it from someone who wasn't aware what the win con is when they were already down to 10 cards in library

[2023-01-06 21:05:13] <+motelmoxy> if we can't win without anvil do we need to mulligan to anvil or stirrings?
[2023-01-06 21:05:22] <+bolander42> tapping out when you have Spell Pierce is the ultimate bluff tbh, they never see it coming
[2023-01-06 21:05:40] <Dubdidupman> LUL
[2023-01-06 21:05:58] <%ValeckSeimu> we need an ANVIL tutor... do u know any PW dat do that? @aspiringspike

[2023-01-06 21:06:15] <@%redsevn> worst case they just draw like 8 cards
[2023-01-06 21:06:16] <%ValeckSeimu> sadCat
[2023-01-06 21:06:21] <%Goody_Phil> they might have just boarded out stations and boarded in needles
[2023-01-06 21:06:56] <FearSide5> there isn't a reasonable 5-6 copies of stirrings, is there?
