[2022-12-19 23:19:11] <+I_Reed_I> The worst thing was, that they changed the rules and instantly baned people for it, why, its like playing a game, scroing points and the kid on the other side yelling that it doesnt count cause bla bla bla

[2022-12-19 23:28:14] <@%Wloos> It can establish the baseline and it makes the opposing party have to almost attack the statement if they have a different opinion
[2022-12-19 23:28:15] <@%Gibster99> It's where the majority thinks everyone thinks one thing but it's actually not even close to the majority
