[2023-01-07 00:16:11] <+honawee> meati is 100% right about this. no class can even compete on druid for slower value

[2023-01-07 00:50:21] <wonzling> there isn't an easy fix for this though. It's the same problem all over the world: aging population, less people in the job market to do essential jobs like health care or education.   so you just need more people, but you won't get them from your population that is shrinking --> immigration

[2023-01-07 01:30:01] <cizuss> like if shadowstep survived 9 years, it will continue to survive
[2023-01-07 01:30:10] <Takkon> even 3 mana astalor would be aproblem for slow decks vs rogues.
[2023-01-07 01:30:25] <Zeon0> 6+6 on final astalor
[2023-01-07 01:30:32] <Zeon0> And he is fine
[2023-01-07 01:30:34] <!XyoJun> Rogue has to go
[2023-01-07 01:30:36] <%+Simylol> they took everything from rogue already

[2023-01-07 01:30:49] <!%+Jymbo26> And inervate
[2023-01-07 01:30:51] <Takkon> this is prime time to remove shadow stop for the year that astalor is in the game so that people can enjoy it in other classes.
[2023-01-07 01:30:52] <!%+Jymbo26> Yup
[2023-01-07 01:30:52] <cizuss> and it's still played KEKW
[2023-01-07 01:30:55] <%+Simylol> can we not make other classes good instead of shitting on rogue
[2023-01-07 01:31:01] <cizuss> but wild growth at 3 mana is kinda shit
[2023-01-07 01:31:01] <+ruabags> hate breads hate Sadge
[2023-01-07 01:31:06] <Zeon0> Because rogue was always op. From classic till now
[2023-01-07 01:31:15] <zyrientic> Remember they nerfed renethal :c

[2023-01-07 01:31:17] <+BoltharHS> Shitting on rogue? What a joke, rogue has been tier S twice in a year, and always playable
[2023-01-07 01:31:17] <%Alpr1010> in blizzards own words, shadowstep and preperation "have had their run" lol
[2023-01-07 01:31:19] <+theburgerclub> shadowstep is the problem because Astor is fine in every other class, just rotate it
[2023-01-07 01:31:22] <%+Saturnalia__> it's better to have a lot of bad classes / cards monetarily
[2023-01-07 01:31:24] <Takkon> innervate deserved it
[2023-01-07 01:31:26] <you4meee> they nerfed wild growth cause they printed the overgrowth
[2023-01-07 01:31:41] VIEWERS: 1 555
[2023-01-07 01:31:41] <ben6clark> they would have to buff every class into the sky to catch up to rogue
[2023-01-07 01:31:43] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @Simylol the power level is so high at the moment, it is better to substantially nerf all the 2022 sets when the 2021 sets rotate
[2023-01-07 01:31:49] <girthySenpai> checks out
[2023-01-07 01:31:58] <xixasHS> why the location give the minion stealth?
[2023-01-07 01:32:02] <%Alpr1010> When was the last time rogue was dumpster tier?
[2023-01-07 01:32:02] <maverix100> Kappa
[2023-01-07 01:32:14] <cizuss> because balance
[2023-01-07 01:32:14] <%+Saturnalia__> @xixashs cause that's what the card text says
[2023-01-07 01:32:20] <thankmr_skeltal> because its a ghost, u cant see ghosts
[2023-01-07 01:32:29] <idiamondmani> Nah
[2023-01-07 01:32:31] <thankmr_skeltal> yes it was buffed, it started at 0/0
[2023-01-07 01:32:31] <%+Simylol> @DaggettTheAngryBeaver not sure i mean powerlevel will go down with rotation on its own
[2023-01-07 01:32:35] <cizuss> i think it originally was silenceable
[2023-01-07 01:32:37] <you4meee> lies...
[2023-01-07 01:32:45] <+honawee> lies
[2023-01-07 01:32:52] <gdcrane19> Neutral otk like ast sire dampen class identity for me
[2023-01-07 01:32:54] <Takkon> you rotate shadow step for the year of astalor, because that is the whole point of the core.  to let you take it out if its too busted for a rotation.
[2023-01-07 01:32:58] <xixasHS> but not 12/12 at turn 4
[2023-01-07 01:33:21] <+honawee> shadow step is so good though, feels so fundamental to rogue
[2023-01-07 01:33:33] <+honawee> don't think it by itself is busted
[2023-01-07 01:33:34] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @Simylol the problem is that every new set has to be slightly stronger than the last years sets... so if 2022 sets keep unnerfed, the 2023 sets will need to be even stronger. At some point, nerfing the last years sets to reset the power level is a good thing
[2023-01-07 01:33:41] VIEWERS: 1 555
[2023-01-07 01:33:54] <+the_high_groundd> just HOF shadowstep and rogue is fine because it will lose to control decks
[2023-01-07 01:34:07] <+honawee> not for 1 HP imo
[2023-01-07 01:34:43] <+BoltharHS> Shadowstep is never by itself, that's the point, it uses broken battlecries to have a Brann you can tempo ANYTIME because it's 0
[2023-01-07 01:34:56] <BrudiVoller> Looking at your arms you should indeed be exercised
[2023-01-07 01:35:03] <%+Saturnalia__> @boltharhs ya, I was confused af by the other comment
[2023-01-07 01:35:13] <%+Saturnalia__> literally doesn't do anything by itself
[2023-01-07 01:35:16] <+honawee> @BoltharHS so the problem is strong battlecries, not shadowstep
[2023-01-07 01:35:25] <plofkimplooie> Id love to see buffs to the 100+ neutral cards that see no play whatsoever

[2023-01-07 01:35:31] <+honawee> rogue has strong cheap battlecries, they can nerf those
[2023-01-07 01:35:38] <+BoltharHS> Powerful battecries ONCE are not a problem

[2023-01-07 02:00:18] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @moppernyc here in Germany, the laws against insulting exist because we don't want people to take the law into their own hands if they are insulted.
[2023-01-07 02:00:19] <Takkon> "free speech" doesn't mean you are ever free from being cancelled.  People conflate being shunned and being imprisoned.

[2023-01-07 02:01:39] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @moppernyc sure, but this leads to the situation where you are legally allowed to insult somebody and there's nothing the insulted person can do, because the state doesn't protect them. That often leads to escalation.
