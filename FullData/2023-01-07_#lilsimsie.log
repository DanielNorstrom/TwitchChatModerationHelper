[2023-01-07 22:32:45] <arrge4444> They are though!! Sims 3 is a lot more realistic
[2023-01-07 22:32:45] <%$Theresevers> TS3 is trying but not succeding at being realistic
[2023-01-07 22:32:45] <%$jen_sim> the sims in sims 3 look like potatoes

[2023-01-07 22:32:52] <bibliopaige> the sims 3 has always looked very uncanny valley to me
[2023-01-07 22:32:52] <%+shelbyplaysthesims> ts3 is very pretty but ts4 is by far superior
[2023-01-07 22:32:52] <%+sweetberri101> the sims in my opinion all look the same and it is impossible to make them look really different from eachother
[2023-01-07 22:32:53] <ColorlessChamaeleon> it took me forever to get used to sims 4 after playing sims 3 for like 8 years
[2023-01-07 22:32:53] <%$sammythesparkleberry> To me the Sims3 looks likely clay
[2023-01-07 22:32:54] <%+maiziemaze23> These graphics hurt my head.

[2023-01-07 22:32:57] <dropp_deadd_lexx> I have to agree. Love the ways sims 3 looks over sims 4
[2023-01-07 22:32:58] <bienens_> I miss the sims 3 graphics some times
[2023-01-07 22:32:58] <+ELDRITCH_HORROR> I am tired of looking at TS3 POTATO FACES over and over again.
[2023-01-07 22:32:59] <%+iamgrapp> I like ts4 style better but the detail in ts3 is unmatched
[2023-01-07 22:33:00] <angiejemima> I enjoyed the sims 3. It wasn‚Äôt that bad!
[2023-01-07 22:33:02] <MrLingon> I remember when the norm was to think TS3>TS4! Those were the days. Basically, 3 has a more realistic style
[2023-01-07 22:33:02] <%+minkomoo> when sims4 first came out, I much preferred the sims3 look
[2023-01-07 22:33:02] <$MarylynBirds> the style-debate I understand but quality of ts4 is so much better
[2023-01-07 22:33:04] <caitertots_> have you seen how horrifying the sims 3 sims are? spooku
[2023-01-07 22:33:04] <@%ItIsDanya> that kitchen is.... something
[2023-01-07 22:33:05] <NotJehric> the sims 3 graphics are more realistic than the sims 4
[2023-01-07 22:33:05] <%rachibby> oh my, that kitchen
[2023-01-07 22:33:07] <%+sarlilpot> i like sims 3 graphics but sims 4 ones are better i think
[2023-01-07 22:33:07] <emma_robbie> TS3 is so dark and that shadows and contrast are so intense I feel
[2023-01-07 22:33:07] <little_miss_anxiety> hey everyone. sorry im late discord didnt sent out a notif
[2023-01-07 22:33:08] <iheartsims4e> How long until you play not trying to be ignorant

[2023-01-07 22:33:09] <strawberrydaiquirie> I like the menu in TS3, but it's so small lol

[2023-01-07 22:33:10] <%+coffeepanda25> do the high chairs actually work in ts3?

[2023-01-07 22:33:20] <%$holy_marisa> I‚Äôm just not a fan of the realistic graphics. Cartoony just fits the sims more
[2023-01-07 22:33:20] <angiejemima> The music of the sims 3 was so enjoyable lol
[2023-01-07 22:33:23] <%+pIushiemi> the sims 4 graphics are really cartoony and charming

[2023-01-07 22:33:54] <amio2023> I love the sims 3 gameplay but the sims 4 graphics more
[2023-01-07 22:33:54] <%+pIushiemi> those green tile countertops area really cute kayla
[2023-01-07 22:33:55] <juliaabsurde> great job
[2023-01-07 22:33:55] <Jaskier_13> holy moly, these graphics look way better than I remember honestly, especially like the floor/ground textures and the lightning doesn't look half bad either, the actual people tho look like they are made of clay tho lol
[2023-01-07 22:33:58] <%gracenottheface> were six burner stoves a thing or just in the sims 3? I've only ever seen them in this game.
[2023-01-07 22:33:58] <ImJakeDeason> This is why Save and Sip exists. Sims 3 saving lasts so long lol
[2023-01-07 22:34:00] <froggyballs101> I love the green it‚Äôs just the yellow walls and appliances that throw me off
[2023-01-07 22:34:01] <cutecoffeebean> What is the sims name?

[2023-01-07 22:34:20] <%plantsy> sims 3 kitchens are iconic i would never want them any other way. always needlessly giant with next to zero counter space
[2023-01-07 22:34:21] <+leelodallasmultipasss> I love the Sims 3 gameplay, wish we could have Sims 4 graphics with Sims 3 gameplay

[2023-01-07 22:34:35] <%$mushfroggie> hi cee!
[2023-01-07 22:34:35] <+courtneypickle> I miss when there were a limited number of jobs available on a given day like in Sims 1 and 2
[2023-01-07 22:34:35] <%+katcasey17> I wish I could play the sims 3 again. Any time I try to open it up on my computer it instantly crashes.
[2023-01-07 22:34:37] <emma_robbie> I feel like the worlds were better in TS3
[2023-01-07 22:34:37] <@%Risshella> i like the style of sims 4 better but the gameplay of sims 3 is more in depth
[2023-01-07 22:34:38] <%$writtenrain> yeah the sims 4 feels like barbie dolls to me
[2023-01-07 22:34:39] <ColorlessChamaeleon> i love sims 3
[2023-01-07 22:34:40] <caitlin_what_> There is pro and cons to both games
[2023-01-07 22:34:41] <mihabubble> i agree!!
[2023-01-07 22:34:42] <%+gibblitss> building in ts3 is horrible, but theres way more to do
[2023-01-07 22:34:42] <iheartsims4e> My fav was the sims2 but I love the sims4 the most
[2023-01-07 22:34:42] <rykaiii> the sims 3>>>>>>>>>>

[2023-01-07 22:34:56] <@%Risshella> build mode in sims 4 is good and im glad there are limited swatches otherwise i would be in build more forever
[2023-01-07 22:34:57] <mihabubble> true
[2023-01-07 22:34:58] <ColorlessChamaeleon> now that i‚Äôm used to sims 4 i like it but i used to love sims 3 so much more
[2023-01-07 22:34:58] <%+lazzlespider> I looooooooove the sims 3 gameplay. The wants/fears system makes playing so much more fun to me!!!
[2023-01-07 22:34:58] <%doodltician> I don‚Äôt miss having to switch modes just to place walls in the sims 3
[2023-01-07 22:34:59] <+laviindr> i think its cuz its nostalgic

[2023-01-07 22:35:00] <strawberrydaiquirie> yes 4 has better customization
[2023-01-07 22:35:01] <%+loveofdragons1221> Sims 3 has so much more. Sims 4 does have better graphics but it gets old after a while
[2023-01-07 22:35:04] <Irogon> I whish sims 4 had the amount of traits that are in sims 3 in the sims 4
[2023-01-07 22:35:05] <cutecoffeebean> True
[2023-01-07 22:35:05] <little_miss_anxiety> @theautummae sameeeeeee
[2023-01-07 22:35:07] <%rachibby> Good point
[2023-01-07 22:35:07] <+ELDRITCH_HORROR> The style of the Sims 3 is worse. I really do enjoy the gameplay and open world, the Create A Style, but THE LAAAAAAAAG. Some neighbourhoods become unplayable! Install all expansions and DLC and just kill your game
[2023-01-07 22:35:07] <+aribeat> Hey everybody! Hope everyone has a good day!!
[2023-01-07 22:35:07] <dropp_deadd_lexx> I hope the sims 5 is more similar to the sims 3 rather than sims 4
[2023-01-07 22:35:07] <NotJehric> ts4 build mode is easier tbh
[2023-01-07 22:35:08] <%NoOne_important_here> i cannot play the sims 3 it crashes my laptop
[2023-01-07 22:35:09] <%gracenottheface> sims 3 sims all look so similar
[2023-01-07 22:35:10] <alliegracexo> rude of the pets to not be adoptable
[2023-01-07 22:35:11] <%+joMlea> But 5 traits
[2023-01-07 22:35:11] <%+iamgrapp> Im shocked at the build mode customization though too
[2023-01-07 22:35:11] <froggo_starfish> The sims 4 IS better
[2023-01-07 22:35:11] <%Jeais> TS3 is waay harder to play vanilla than TS4
[2023-01-07 22:35:12] <%$writtenrain> the lack of the open world ruins the sims 4 for me though
[2023-01-07 22:35:15] <+indigoeternity> sims 4 cas is unmatched
[2023-01-07 22:35:15] <purple_cosmonaut> make a poll
[2023-01-07 22:35:16] <marie_something> all sims 3 sims always look the same hahaha
[2023-01-07 22:35:17] <%$holy_marisa> @laviindr Yeah, there‚Äôs a bit of a bias there
[2023-01-07 22:35:18] <$rabidcherry> the customization on t3 is just overwhelming
[2023-01-07 22:35:18] <666potatolord> the near-unlimited options in create a style stress me out to be honest
[2023-01-07 22:35:18] <emma_robbie> The careers in this game were definitely really good
[2023-01-07 22:35:18] <booklover663> I agree, I love sims 3 game play, but I love the way sims 4 makes building much more fluid.
[2023-01-07 22:35:21] <Cruduxy> LUL
[2023-01-07 22:35:23] <%+acrylicpizzathree> i feel like ts4 is also more intuitive? Like I dont have to usually look up videos on how to use the game lol its p easy to just figure out
[2023-01-07 22:35:23] <ImJakeDeason> Sims 3 with Smoothness Patch !!!
[2023-01-07 22:35:23] <@%$ceesees> sims 1 and 2 aged better than sims 3's style
[2023-01-07 22:35:26] <froggyballs101> If the sims4 just let us change the colors :,(
[2023-01-07 22:35:26] <+jinxiescreations> i remember in sims 2 the only body types were slim big and fit and they all looked the same lol
[2023-01-07 22:35:28] <ang_sier> I actually like Sims 4 more about gameplay too, but I like Sims 2 the best, probably because of nostalgia, but nowadays I play almost only sims 4

[2023-01-07 22:35:41] <denis_ogtf> I like ts 4 better than ts 3 bc I can play it
[2023-01-07 22:35:41] <Archscurl> Thus was my favorite thing in sims 3 ngl

[2023-01-07 22:35:43] <%Dawnie3296> Sounds about right.
[2023-01-07 22:35:43] <%morgansway> Sims 4 definitely cleaned up a lot of things but Sims 3 has more realism
[2023-01-07 22:35:44] <ashleeeeean> is it $100 per child?

[2023-01-07 22:35:45] <+indigoeternity> I like the style of the sims 3, with updated graphics it would beat ts4
[2023-01-07 22:35:45] <%$greendragon1997> i love sims 3 but the build mode makes me want to cry its painful to use
[2023-01-07 22:35:47] <theautummae> I worked in a daycare for 2 months I‚Äôve never been more sick in my entire life I quit

[2023-01-07 22:35:51] <+ghostwxnter> i‚Äôve played more sims 4 in my time but i grew up on free play so i find the sims 3 style more appealing does that make sense

[2023-01-07 23:29:18] <%$lollyybee> i imagine a "transportation" pack would be a cool way to include horses and cars in one xD
[2023-01-07 23:29:18] <kaytast> @yourfavesimp_ get to horse
[2023-01-07 23:29:18] <%$brindleton_bae> I think the sims 4 x barbie wild horse rescue would be a great collab

[2023-01-07 23:29:28] <eeveelock> ride a horse around the block instead of going for a run
[2023-01-07 23:29:28] <%$River_Styx19> @Extsspace seriously, if the dogs can't route properly, can you even imagine horses
[2023-01-07 23:29:32] <lauren777_> would you want sims 5 to be open world

[2023-01-07 23:29:59] <talvikkixo> I think horses need too much realism to not be kinda weird and the things they need to add to achieve that realism is just way too much to add at this point lol

[2023-01-07 23:30:02] <lauren777_> @nessieisnotacat then they'll make kits called "Horse Accessories"

[2023-01-07 23:32:46] <%+bethgamergal> I want another sims castaway
[2023-01-07 23:32:47] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:32:54] <%+bethgamergal> I loved that game on ps2
[2023-01-07 23:32:55] <IceCrystie> I kinda like that it is all spilt up, so you can pick and choose what you want
[2023-01-07 23:32:56] <%$moosiegal> nickel and diming is what kits are for
[2023-01-07 23:32:57] <palis84> Yes, A foal in the garden
[2023-01-07 23:32:57] <kaytast> @shortmusicianL yep lots! you can even be a firefighter
[2023-01-07 23:32:58] <%$samanthaverb> Do you remember boarding school? I miss that lol
[2023-01-07 23:33:00] <talvikkixo> Does sims 3 have vampires or werewolfs?
[2023-01-07 23:33:00] <%+SpiderMeg07> not the horse walking by
[2023-01-07 23:33:02] <+MerKitty96> @mrstomato101814 exactly what I was thinking
[2023-01-07 23:33:03] <%missrileybear> I just really want proper stuff for elders in the sims 4 they basically just sit around waiting to die
[2023-01-07 23:33:05] <ilovekhyle> A FOAL IN GARDEN
[2023-01-07 23:33:08] <+jinxiescreations> @jinxiescreations yes omg i loved it i was so sad they didnt have it in sims 4 i used to have my kids have their friends stay the night and set up sleeping bags
[2023-01-07 23:33:09] <%Missygirl93> @samanthaverb I do..
[2023-01-07 23:33:09] <rowanenby> Making it as multiple packs makes the gameplay better because they can focus on the specifics more imo
[2023-01-07 23:33:10] <%$River_Styx19> No for sure. I love it too
[2023-01-07 23:33:10] <little_miss_anxiety> ik this is off topic, but do you plan decorating your ddlv valley ?
[2023-01-07 23:33:10] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:33:14] <%+pIushiemi> i think a little bit of family gameplay comes in most of the packs, but a dedicated family gameplay pack would be really nice
[2023-01-07 23:33:17] <%Dawnie3296> Do you think they will update Parenthood?
[2023-01-07 23:33:20] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:33:21] <annie_2404> I wish we could have the sims 3 game play and then have the sims 4 graphics
[2023-01-07 23:33:21] <%+SpiderMeg07> that horse had perfect timing
[2023-01-07 23:33:22] <purple_cosmonaut> Isn't the entirety of The Sims family gameplay tho?
[2023-01-07 23:33:23] <%+bethgamergal> I loved making the clothes and climbing trees
[2023-01-07 23:33:28] <%+snowy_flake> every kid would be sent away for a week
[2023-01-07 23:33:28] <dawnpenguin> i always sent my kids to boarding school lol
[2023-01-07 23:33:29] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:33:29] <%$moosiegal> samee
[2023-01-07 23:33:31] <%JoyInAbility> boarding school would be amazing'
[2023-01-07 23:33:34] <ashleeeeean> Military School tho
[2023-01-07 23:33:35] <makemily> i love the sims 4 i just wish the sims had more personality, i think they were trying to do that with wants and fears but the wants and fears are annoying
[2023-01-07 23:33:35] <%+brindletonfae> grim just took both of my cats at the same time
[2023-01-07 23:33:35] <@%+MrsTomato101814> especially with big families, playing with lots of kids is overwhelming
[2023-01-07 23:33:36] <talvikkixo> I think horses gameplay is kinda weird in sims 3 too, the way you just have horses walking around
[2023-01-07 23:33:36] <ImJakeDeason> Sims 3 University >>> Sims 4 University
[2023-01-07 23:33:37] <jupiter_moon19> how do i turn on the closed captions on twitch?

[2023-01-07 23:33:40] <%+Keithy1000> I wish we had more careers where we can join them at work
[2023-01-07 23:33:42] <+MerKitty96> High School Pack refresh: boarding school lol they really need to do more pack refreshes
[2023-01-07 23:33:43] <%+SpiderMeg07> boarding school would be so nice
[2023-01-07 23:33:45] <shortmusicianL> good old simsie wanting to get rid of the kids lol
[2023-01-07 23:33:45] <%Sammiskate> Inviting the principal over and trying to impress them to get into private school though... that was the winner

[2023-01-07 23:33:46] <+AJSOUZA> Cheer100

[2023-01-07 23:33:47] <froggo_starfish> Do u think of parenthood as a tiny generations pack? :D
[2023-01-07 23:33:49] <%$bts_loona> i wish we could set uniforms in the high school from sims 4
[2023-01-07 23:33:50] <KATIEWEBSSS> The only thing I really really want is actually game play between generation like grandparent and grandchildren specific interactions

[2023-01-07 23:35:14] <%$River_Styx19> more playground stuff too. We need slides

[2023-01-07 23:35:23] <viviancuckoo> @jenkendar1984 it did :/
[2023-01-07 23:35:25] <%+Keithy1000> I hope the infants update isn't buggy
[2023-01-07 23:35:26] <%$moosiegal> I would love expansion on family recognition of uncles, aunts, cousins, etc

[2023-01-07 23:35:36] <+ada_xox> What is the mod called that lets you see people progressing in their career and if people have had a baby or got engaged? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ts3 base game
[2023-01-07 23:35:37] <%+ashlynbeth> i know that packs that require packs are bad, but i wish there was a way to have maternity visits with the doctor career in get to work

[2023-01-07 23:35:58] <holmskii> one time i killed my sims husband and then that night i had a dream they came out with a funeral pack and he was in the ad
[2023-01-07 23:35:58] <lauren777_> kayla playing a horror game when
[2023-01-07 23:35:58] <little_miss_anxiety> if kids could ask parents for random objects like they do irl
[2023-01-07 23:35:58] <starrynyte12> lol then there's me who doesn't like children and I always feel like there is nothing for sims to do except have children. it is very difficult if you want to explore non marriage, non child bearing family play
[2023-01-07 23:35:59] <%+bethgamergal> So in social events we can‚Äôt do a funeral?
[2023-01-07 23:35:59] <talvikkixo> What is the biggest thing you miss from sims 3 that sims 4 doesn‚Äôt have? (As someone who only played very little sims 3 pets as a child and doesn‚Äôt know how this game really works)
[2023-01-07 23:36:02] <%+pIushiemi> i think we should get more picture frames i am tired of the basic ones </3
[2023-01-07 23:36:02] <MariposaMoon> thank you mods!!

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-07 23:36:07] <%+bethgamergal> I don‚Äôt think there is a way officially
[2023-01-07 23:36:08] <%stardaisy2005> I really want a stroller in the sims 4 rissheAww
[2023-01-07 23:36:09] <%Cozy_Gamer8> I think funerals would just fail like wedding stories üòÖ

[2023-01-07 23:36:21] <caitertots_> I wish family members would auto go in your relationship panel, so then you know them and can easily get to know them better
[2023-01-07 23:36:21] <KATIEWEBSSS> Rent a cemetery type of gameplay
[2023-01-07 23:36:22] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:36:24] <littlemizzkitty> I really need graveyard
[2023-01-07 23:36:26] <veja1> one of the sim gurus posted a photo with scythe so maybe we will vet something with funerals
[2023-01-07 23:36:28] <talvikkixo> Can you listen to music in headphones in sims 4? I saw someone mention something like that
[2023-01-07 23:36:31] <%+pIushiemi> wait what nots so berry generation are you on right now
[2023-01-07 23:36:32] <beauxflow1> do you um think the sims 3 will run well with 32GB of ram?
[2023-01-07 23:36:34] <%+madthehat> i'd love to see parenting styles that affect the child's personality in the long run. kinda like character values but more involved for storytelling
[2023-01-07 23:36:37] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:36:38] <%Sammiskate> I just want sims to stop entirely forgetting their family members... I don't have time to keep interacting with uncles and cousins that doesn't mean i want to forget they exist....
[2023-01-07 23:36:40] <+xemily330> you should try a funeral mod, just once
[2023-01-07 23:36:42] <%missrileybear> I do like pregnancy the best in sims 4 though just because of the ability to take a pregnancy test
[2023-01-07 23:36:45] <annie_2404> funerals would add so much realism
[2023-01-07 23:36:46] <billynatasha91> I wish you could move sim out of family home but keep household inventory/unlocks. I want to move out young adult sims but don't like losing everything
[2023-01-07 23:36:48] <%+malloryeilleen> @MrsTomato101814 or the game recognizing nancy and johnny as mom and son....
[2023-01-07 23:36:48] <%+chocolate_tpot> But Sims would probably just dance in the aisles at funerals. Lol.
[2023-01-07 23:36:48] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:36:51] <%+kkotafish> @beauxflow1 oh definitely
[2023-01-07 23:36:51] <little_miss_anxiety> a coming out option would be really cool too for story play with LGBTQ sims
[2023-01-07 23:36:52] <conne35> at least something like gather together and greave the ded person

[2023-01-07 23:37:01] <katiebugthethug> Gurus are you listening? Haha
[2023-01-07 23:37:02] <%+eve_not_online> Pansy was sitting in dog Lee‚Ä¶
[2023-01-07 23:37:02] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @beauxflow1 it should but i would look up the exact specs to make sure!
[2023-01-07 23:37:05] <ashleeeeean> I want reasons to play on long lifespan honestly
[2023-01-07 23:37:06] <lauren777_> I just started a legacy challenge and I don't want my sims to die
[2023-01-07 23:37:08] <+jenkendar1984> I think the kids are getting dirty because the dog peed on the floor and they keep crawling in it
[2023-01-07 23:37:08] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @MrsTomato101814 for real omg
[2023-01-07 23:37:09] <jupiter_moon19> also half siblings? i hate how they are roomates despite having the same dad
[2023-01-07 23:37:16] <%$River_Styx19> omg the stupid jingle
[2023-01-07 23:37:22] <tammi9495> I literally downloaded sims 3 again and I loved the vibes but it is definitely not Mac compatible and laggy
[2023-01-07 23:37:22] <KATIEWEBSSS> I think the sims 5 will be the best game if the sims team look at the favourite features from each game
[2023-01-07 23:37:23] <annie_2404> @little_miss_anxiety I loovvee that
[2023-01-07 23:37:25] <%digibatz> i forgot about the jingle aww
[2023-01-07 23:37:26] <%+kiemurphy20> They could have pregnancy classes and stuff!!
[2023-01-07 23:37:27] <%$River_Styx19> god forbid you have the audio off
[2023-01-07 23:37:29] <%lalalasunny> I miss the jingle lol
[2023-01-07 23:37:29] <peggys8467> i‚Äôm sorry what
[2023-01-07 23:37:30] <beauxflow1> its prob overkill to have 32GB of ram for the sims 3
[2023-01-07 23:37:30] <conne35> what lol
[2023-01-07 23:37:32] <%+sadgirlash> and the maternity clothes are better in sims 4 too!
[2023-01-07 23:37:32] <qbert12lol> Hi

[2023-01-07 23:37:45] <$NessieIsNotACat> why did the sims team think this was a good idea
[2023-01-07 23:37:45] <shortmusicianL> pregnancy uniform lol
[2023-01-07 23:37:45] <%+bethgamergal> Yeah you waited for the puking lol
[2023-01-07 23:37:46] <karenam7> Oof
[2023-01-07 23:37:47] <%Cozy_Gamer8> @little_miss_anxiety I think there‚Äôs a big reason they do have that - such as bad memories for those who have had to do that or anxiety inducing moments with it. Instead in the sims everyone just gets to be themselves
[2023-01-07 23:37:47] <froggo_starfish> You had to listen- ew-
[2023-01-07 23:37:48] <ihugmars> And you couldn‚Äôt even customise the maternity clothes!!!
[2023-01-07 23:37:51] <+xemily330> my computer would stall when they changed into the maternity clothes
[2023-01-07 23:37:53] <emilyrbcs> the maternity clothes were so bad

[2023-01-07 23:38:03] <@%$ceesees> oh no
[2023-01-07 23:38:03] <%+pIushiemi> i feel like that feature is a little bit inaccessible to people who cant hear OFIJEAOIJFA
[2023-01-07 23:38:05] <%+joMlea> Anyone else hearing the jingle now in their heads
[2023-01-07 23:38:06] <jordvaillancourt> Hi Simsie, hope you are doing great today. And omg i miss sims 3 gameplay, awesome for you to play it today
[2023-01-07 23:38:08] <skwnix> who needs money anyways.....
[2023-01-07 23:38:09] <dean_o> too close to life
[2023-01-07 23:38:09] <%stardaisy2005> omg the maternity clothes in the sims 3 were not it simsieFail
[2023-01-07 23:38:12] <+leelodallasmultipasss> omg I forgot about the ugly maternity clothes
[2023-01-07 23:38:12] <%$samanthaverb> Kinda accurate though
[2023-01-07 23:38:12] <+slimerspengler> imagine doing the 100 baby challenge in the sims 3
[2023-01-07 23:38:12] <@%+MrsTomato101814> just having their regular clothes set as maternity clothes is a HUGE difference
[2023-01-07 23:38:13] <%$eliza2242> so similar to real life? lol
[2023-01-07 23:38:13] <%Missygirl93> We still have yet to see the what the Sims dentures go to!
[2023-01-07 23:38:14] <%+Corinne_11> Too realistic.

[2023-01-07 23:38:19] <ghanga_sim> I totally didn‚Äôt know about the jingle and I played it for like 10+ years
[2023-01-07 23:38:20] <111nemi> male privelege
[2023-01-07 23:38:23] <sarahstyles39> let‚Äôs hope sims 5 is more realistic lmao
[2023-01-07 23:38:24] <little_miss_anxiety> @Cozy_Gamer8 oh you are so right-- i didn't think of that so it makes sense why it wouldnt be an option
[2023-01-07 23:38:27] <dean_o> too realistic
[2023-01-07 23:38:28] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:38:29] <valerkazavr> Pretty realistic, haha
[2023-01-07 23:38:29] <shortmusicianL> too realistic lol
[2023-01-07 23:38:29] <KATIEWEBSSS> Would they be paid? I think maternity leave in the uk is paid
[2023-01-07 23:38:30] <%juicyjadawada> That's literally like 3 months in game
[2023-01-07 23:38:31] <%+madthehat> how america thinks parental leave works
[2023-01-07 23:38:31] <lucie_doo> Just bought cottage living, tiny living and stranger things on sale‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really hard for me to spend money on games but oh well
[2023-01-07 23:38:31] <$missslinkydiva> I'm trying to raid

[2023-01-07 23:38:36] <Trash_Queen_> I hated having a kid outside of marriage in sims 3 because when you married the other parent later on it made them a step parent no matter what
[2023-01-07 23:38:36] <%plantsy> maternity wear was also a curse in ts3
[2023-01-07 23:38:36] <%+CPgremlin> I mean, stalled career development due to pregnancy is horrible accurate
[2023-01-07 23:38:38] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:38:41] <batsandbabydolls> in sims 2, maternity leave is also optional
[2023-01-07 23:38:44] <dammitkirstie> simsie!! I just logged in after that weird update and I don't know how to fix it!
[2023-01-07 23:38:46] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:38:49] <viviancuckoo> wait what was the promotion thing?
[2023-01-07 23:38:49] <ihugmars> Sims 3 rerouter mod changed lives because you can remove maternity leave
[2023-01-07 23:38:52] <+slimerspengler> can you get mods in the sims 3 to shorten the maternity leave?
[2023-01-07 23:38:52] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:38:54] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @eliza2242 idk about you but at least in the US maternity leave is SHORT and completely optional, depending on your employer
[2023-01-07 23:38:54] <%+madthehat> but wasn't it unpaid?
[2023-01-07 23:38:55] <TheActualMemeGoddess> And if you had seasons installed, they‚Äôd also miss leisure day
[2023-01-07 23:38:56] <MariposaMoon> i started on sims 1 but only ever built bc my computer was sooo slow
[2023-01-07 23:38:56] <sarahstyles39> maternity clothes need to be a thing in ts5
[2023-01-07 23:38:56] <Love_Natalie> I honestly loved the default maternity clothes it was so hilarious
[2023-01-07 23:38:59] <%$alaurel17> irl maternity leave is important. my sims however can get over it and go to work
[2023-01-07 23:38:59] <dammitkirstie> I have 64 bit idk why it doesn't work
[2023-01-07 23:39:00] <qbert12lol> Hi simsie
[2023-01-07 23:39:00] <starrynyte12> idk as a person who never wants to have children, there is nothing in the sims that reflects my life
[2023-01-07 23:39:02] <rrrandomgirl> The quality looks good
[2023-01-07 23:39:05] <%+joMlea> Forced maternity is different
[2023-01-07 23:39:06] <qbert12lol> Hi
[2023-01-07 23:39:09] <%+talisha200> i used to always hear the sims 2 phone in my ears even when i wasnt playing cuz of how much i used to hear it simsieLOL
[2023-01-07 23:39:09] <%$eliza2242> trueeee
[2023-01-07 23:39:09] <lauren777_> no we get it x
[2023-01-07 23:39:12] <little_miss_anxiety> how about the option for the male partner in a heterosexual relationship to stay home and not ONLY the mother
[2023-01-07 23:39:13] <MisterPandaBoom> Sounds great

[2023-01-07 23:39:19] <Cruduxy> young adulthood is like 21 days LUL 10 days of maternity leave is like taking 5 years off
[2023-01-07 23:39:21] <%+pIushiemi> at the very least i think you should be able to choose for your sims to work or take the extended leave

[2023-01-07 23:39:27] <%+OutlanderUnicorn> I mean, it feels like Sims get more maternity leave than real life, when you consider game time vs. real time

[2023-01-07 23:45:02] <%oanayu> probably unpopular opinion, but i prefer the family gameplay in ts4 rather than ts3, cause ts3 is way too overwhelming, there's too much to do, so i always end up playing with one young adult and world adventures
