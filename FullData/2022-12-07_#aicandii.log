[2022-12-07 11:23:41] <%$dongermancometh> spoilers: batman's parents are dead
[2022-12-07 11:23:48] <%+SheWhoRISES> I like they didn't need to do the origin story, that's one upside to less Bruce. But, yes, you are allowed to miss Bruce.
[2022-12-07 11:23:53] <%+yukineb> I do want a Bruce Wayne character in the next one, I like Pattinson in the role so far

[2022-12-07 11:56:29] <@%$KotinDraws> Subscription good. Shows awesome
[2022-12-07 11:56:30] <+InariForges> Ahh I'm the opposite, I'm a huge film nerd because I studied film. I love understanding HOW things are made and done. It's the same reason I got into making animation. Understand how pretty picture happen, happy brain chemical happen.

[2022-12-07 11:56:49] <neoninjax07> a myanimelist stream?
[2022-12-07 11:56:55] <readreadchopper> ive had Netflix for like 7 years and I've still not seen breaking bad
[2022-12-07 11:56:55] <%royalmct> yeah there will be a bunch on crunchyroll you can watch
[2022-12-07 11:56:55] <+Angel_Of_Telos> I got rid of netflix a while ago. It was right before they went to $12.
[2022-12-07 11:57:03] <%+VolkanRemix> i made a list with a couple of friends for animes to watch its like two pages long
[2022-12-07 11:57:08] <%+Lankasaurus_Rekt> thats really the only way I can watch stuff

[2022-12-07 11:57:33] <%Realware> fairly sure you can watch crunchyroll without paying, but you just have to wait an extra week for shows
[2022-12-07 11:58:02] <%Realware> weird

[2022-12-07 11:58:15] <%royalmct> man i need to catch up so much on critical role, only caught like the 3 or 4 of the new campaign
[2022-12-07 11:58:24] <+Angel_Of_Telos> Probably because they streamed the first 3 episodes for free. LUL

[2022-12-07 11:58:42] <+InariForges> Highly recommend a show called Dark on Netflix. Although requires much focus. Involves Time Travel and like. No focus brings much confuse.
[2022-12-07 11:58:48] <readreadchopper> peepotalk is a personality buff and geega have

[2022-12-07 11:59:06] <%Stabbineezer> yeah dark is really good
[2022-12-07 11:59:15] <neoninjax07> the manga is pretty nice, but thats mostly through scanlators and buying it in stores when official translations drop

[2022-12-07 12:43:26] <%azraeldarknut> I agree. Usually unless there's an unlock behind something, I won't go for achievements

[2022-12-07 12:43:38] <NerdLetter> I miss when achievements were like little easter egg things like "find the part of this level that's a movie reference" and not just "congrats, you did this x amount of times"

[2022-12-07 12:52:30] <@%CptTinko> @artifactsglow because teeth are delicate bitches

[2022-12-07 14:06:20] <MalaccanRebel> there's no benefit for Tiktok except for commercialisation..
[2022-12-07 14:06:37] <%hemulator98> I dunno how that would work since a million views on a tiktok pays you a dime
[2022-12-07 14:06:44] <%GrayOfSloth> and now there are youtube shorts aicRIP

[2022-12-07 14:33:35] <%gosb1t> solution: use 24h format

[2022-12-07 14:34:45] <AkaruiYamiDono> add -12 after 12pm and you get the time
[2022-12-07 14:34:48] <%MaygeNyte> subtract 12 from the 24 hr time to get 12 hr time
[2022-12-07 14:34:50] <%Spacekivvi> Why not 00 am
[2022-12-07 14:34:51] <%joku72> Could also be because of language.
