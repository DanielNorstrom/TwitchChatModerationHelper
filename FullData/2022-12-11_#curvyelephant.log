[2022-12-11 00:08:10] <%Rejzorlight> hey curvy, next time there's a cold snap you have to manually set all the plants to harvest. they only harvest plants that are 100% grown normally, but you can harvest earlier for a lower yield curvyeSmile

[2022-12-11 00:22:54] <%I_Like_0range> the herbal meds somewhat do, but they last like a year without one
[2022-12-11 00:23:46] <dinorauria> AYAYA
[2022-12-11 00:24:58] <Impulsivity> you should make a new allowed area for animals so they dont go inside and track dirt everywhere
[2022-12-11 00:25:29] <%I_Like_0range> looks like an expansion for the little workshop

[2022-12-11 00:25:57] <%I_Like_0range> its like encloseing where the heat goes from 3 coolers isnt the best idea peepoGiggles
[2022-12-11 00:26:25] <%I_Like_0range> just remove the roof over that corridor and put the wall back
[2022-12-11 00:26:51] <Cindicatex> yeah then it will just vent to the outsdie
[2022-12-11 00:27:58] <Impulsivity> nah, but its kinda redundant imo
[2022-12-11 00:27:59] <%+TacoGS> Does blood not require refrigeration?
[2022-12-11 00:28:05] <%I_Like_0range> it does not taco

[2022-12-11 00:55:55] <%I_Like_0range> best to just let him tend without meds so he doesnt die
[2022-12-11 00:56:12] <%I_Like_0range> all meds does is help reduce the scaring and infection
[2022-12-11 00:56:58] <%I_Like_0range> expecially if you are just farming people for organs, best to just tend without meds NODDERS
[2022-12-11 00:57:03] <%I_Like_0range> harvesting heart kills them
