[2023-01-07 06:42:49] <%mrq02> problem with recycling is that most plastic just ends up getting thrown in the landfill from the recyclers, because it's not cost effective. But hopefully we'll get that figured out eventually! A new filter and 1 bottle is definitely better than a bunch of new bottles! :-)

[2023-01-07 08:45:54] <Bad_Wolf_Kurt> @AriaSaki i agree with you cause your tank is supossed to play like that , diva is not a play back tank
[2023-01-07 08:46:19] <+breklohm> Yeah, the problem with the game rn is they still haven't balanced the game around how people actually want to play

[2023-01-07 15:30:25] <0oooaquaooo0> on the bright side! guess the game believes ur diamond
[2023-01-07 15:30:33] <mercymain_24> one game i had Gm top 500 and master challengers in enemy when i am just gold
[2023-01-07 15:30:33] <%markpygas> They should just go back to one rank for every role
[2023-01-07 15:30:36] <%+Sparemaple> @SuperSaiyanRudy they were a support

[2023-01-07 15:31:04] <Addimoo> Yeh game knowledge and all
[2023-01-07 15:31:11] <exologi> U should play against console players for easy wins
[2023-01-07 15:31:12] <%katIyin> yea the fact that the que works by what role the he's playing even tho their other role is diamond is stupid
[2023-01-07 15:31:12] <NoobSalmon> Aware

[2023-01-07 15:31:29] <maladictus_> true
[2023-01-07 15:31:32] <KingAvenging> so its IQ?
[2023-01-07 15:31:32] <%markpygas> If you're diamond on one role, you have the game knowledge that silver players don't
[2023-01-07 15:31:37] <%+nat_stuffs> u shouldnt even have to explain this LMAO
[2023-01-07 15:31:39] <emaher> but diamond though KEKW
[2023-01-07 15:31:42] <zFluxyz> hii ariasaki
[2023-01-07 15:31:42] <%ash1520> tank is easier in some cases than dps too
[2023-01-07 15:31:43] <+SuperSaiyanRudy> I'm diamond dps but gold tank and support, my games aren't the same
[2023-01-07 15:31:44] <+Raphton___> You are just bad imo

[2023-01-07 16:24:48] <curly1026> If ur past games were better than usual for ur sr/mmr u get put in silver/gold lobbies
[2023-01-07 16:24:48] <Jurgen___> Blizzard is still trying to figure out the system too
[2023-01-07 16:24:54] <dquasar> rank profiles means nothing, all about that hidden mmr
[2023-01-07 16:25:03] <xCounTeR> there is no system. I was master and started bronze. Poopy ow ranking system
[2023-01-07 16:25:08] <curly1026> The whole comp system is kinda getting a mini rework

[2023-01-07 16:26:49] <@%^StreamElements> @rank Aria peak OW rank is Gold 4 (TNK)
[2023-01-07 16:26:53] <+SuperSaiyanRudy> So you mentioned you didn't know mechanics to help you climb? Can I ask what did you mean by that?
[2023-01-07 16:27:25] <leeyawnknowell> Hi guys, I've been watching the stream since last year without using an account, just decided to make one since it's also my birthday today
[2023-01-07 16:27:37] <bbw__slayer> Happy birthday dad
[2023-01-07 16:27:47] <@%fabriisio> Hmm
[2023-01-07 16:27:51] <curly1026> It's like once u hit that point that ur doing better than ur average silver tank, in ur case, they put u up against a slightly higher rank, that's why u saw some gold player. This system is gonna get boosted a bit by win multipliers, once u get a win-streak or close to it they'll boost u a bit
[2023-01-07 16:27:51] <leeyawnknowell> I love this stream its so chill
[2023-01-07 16:27:54] <%+SeibaRiryi> Imagine if they could somehow rank game knowledge
[2023-01-07 16:27:55] <0oooaquaooo0> dad?
[2023-01-07 16:27:57] <%markpygas> No one in the lower ranks actually communicates, which is very important in terms of climbing.

[2023-01-07 16:41:02] <Jindojay> I mean i use Moira alot. but sometimes her healing feels lower than other healers/
[2023-01-07 16:41:14] <curly1026> @nuralisa96 If ur other healers is main and techy ur fine, u can focus on healing ur dps and gaining heals for it. Moira's orb is gonna get u some heals too when using it as damage later

[2023-01-07 19:02:07] <technick916> Cycle your shield so that you take dmg to half health. Then put up shield and allow healers to top you off. Pull shield before it breaks that way it‚Äôs ready if you need it. Rinse and repeat. Keep enemy team focused on you as tank, it will keep your dps and healers alive longer which will allow you to live longer.

[2023-01-07 19:27:46] <Marshall2d> @nuralisa96 just ask your other support to play a AOe healer

[2023-01-07 19:28:29] <mercymain_24> @nuralisa96 I never res DPS unless they are the only ones left XD my first prio is tank then is healer cause we can fight longer if we have tank and 2 healers alive
[2023-01-07 19:28:53] <vareona> @nuralisa96 the higher rank you go, it's better to pocket the DPS than the tank. It's usually Mercy with DPS and the other supp heals the tank
[2023-01-07 19:29:03] <$nuralisa96> true true. agreed. I only res if that DPS is good. @mercymain_24

[2023-01-07 19:33:45] <vareona> @mercymain_24 it depends on the hero. If you're Ana/Bap you have enough healing to solo heal your tank. If you're Mercy you're losing value by pocketing tank instead of damage boosting DPS
