[2022-12-28 18:42:04] <t3h_f0x> I just think this game is dumb because sniper rifles dont one shot headshot and shotguns cant kill from point blank

[2022-12-28 18:42:21] <+WoodyRover> ok
[2022-12-28 18:42:25] <%DrTwitchh> We've seen the loadout destroy a heavy chopper, that car would probably do the same
[2022-12-28 18:43:03] <t3h_f0x> theres no point of a .50 BMG if it does as much damage as any other sniper rifle lol
[2022-12-28 18:43:16] <tHxGorilla> i blew myself up ehit a loadout fallin on my car twice lol
[2022-12-28 18:43:22] <%TnT_4gaming> Ive seen a team load it in the back of the flatbed by pushing it off the cliff
[2022-12-28 18:43:37] <%TnT_4gaming> it was super heavy and tthey could barley drive
[2022-12-28 18:43:40] <+Purplesmurf24> a 50 cal doesnt 1 shot to the head, but you can 2 tap someone with melee if they have blue ARMOR.
[2022-12-28 18:43:51] <tHxGorilla> yes it kills you trust me lol
[2022-12-28 18:43:59] <%Ninj4doggy> wtf
[2022-12-28 18:44:01] <%+weerez44> I'm guessing loadouts are indestructable and probably destroy anything they come in contact with.

[2022-12-28 20:20:03] <iamAprilMejorado> I agree
[2022-12-28 20:20:04] <thebroomaster> literally what I did 3 years ago and never looked back. Mon/Wed/Fri never miss my workouts, this is just me now
[2022-12-28 20:20:10] <nighthawk293> Consistency. Water beats the rock with Consistency
[2022-12-28 20:20:13] <%Snow_Trouble> Same with time. We all get busy and some times we fuck ourselves by putting too many irons in the fire, but if you need time to do the thing that‚Äôs important to you, you need to make the time. One way or another.
[2022-12-28 20:20:14] <cheddar__shredder> big facts. personal trainer for 6 years, fuck motivation. just do that shit.
[2022-12-28 20:20:14] <composit3> That‚Äôs not from me. That‚Äôs from science btw.

[2022-12-28 20:20:19] <%krazy_mystery> @theRealYanks not motivation you. need discipline. Just do it and on the days you do not want to are the days you hit it the hardest. You go this. EXCUSES or accomplished goals
[2022-12-28 20:20:38] <+kingvalenti> In prep 5 weeks out, last thing I want to do is fucking train. Discipline gets it done always

[2022-12-28 20:22:03] <cheddar__shredder> i‚Äôd recommend finding other ways of strength training that are more enjoyable than lifting weights. bouldering/rock climbing was a huge addition to my routine. way more fun than just moving heavy objects.
[2022-12-28 20:22:15] <%BrunoCorrea22> I don't even think about it anymore, Mon to Fri at 6pm I just go to the gym vissDERP

[2022-12-28 20:22:51] <thebroomaster> best life, find something you enjoy that makes money, something you enjoy that gets you exercise, and something you enjoy that makes you critical think
[2022-12-28 20:23:29] <composit3> Best thing to do it make the thing you love a reward for doing something you don‚Äôt love. Watch twitch only when/after working out or something like that
[2022-12-28 20:23:33] <cheddar__shredder> don‚Äôt forget that you don‚Äôt need to workout for 60-90min everytime. you can crush a full body workout in 20min.

[2022-12-28 21:01:53] <%Snow_Trouble> @hypnochikken it uses an optical input for the xbox (I‚Äôm still on a One X) and I hear the Series X doesn‚Äôt have that, so maybe ask @jtothedizzle how he hooks his A50s up to his.
[2022-12-28 21:02:21] <%Snow_Trouble> Honestly I love my A50s. Solid headset, the A40s are great too, but the former are a little heavier duty built and of course, wireless.

[2022-12-28 21:07:47] <%Snow_Trouble> @jtothedizzle oh gotcha. I stopped using TB when I went to FPS games. Too much bass.
