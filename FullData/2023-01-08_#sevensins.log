[2023-01-08 09:41:54] <%+yeroon> my experience younger kids (under 4) is that they understand logic and reason, however, don't try and negotiate with them like they are your colleague at work. As eventhough they understand logic and reason, they do not have the reasoning skills and experience that adults have. So finding the balance on how to converse is the challenge for me as the adult, as i have that experience :)

[2023-01-08 09:47:38] <%+yeroon> the thing with curse words in dutch, the words themselves have meaning, but usually the way we say them, doesnt convey that meaning. But other cultures are like: no no, you used a bad word. They focus to much on the word and not its context. Kids don't have that context yet :)
