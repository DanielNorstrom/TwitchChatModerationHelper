[2023-01-10 15:41:02] <Zardak123> @clockwork__ninja but most top streamers are professional gamers and have sponsorship
[2023-01-10 15:41:02] <chameleoneyes11> I think I'd agree with that but the requirement for girls on twitch is that you have to be attractive
[2023-01-10 15:41:02] <womreaker> can you describe your content in three words
[2023-01-10 15:41:17] <@%$heavymetalrules> the point is you should care about your partner's mental health
[2023-01-10 15:41:17] <greenbaybucks> I agree with your take. Girls can make it full time easier but harder to become a huge streamer

[2023-01-10 15:43:17] <+darkfox566> your skin is just amazing today
[2023-01-10 15:43:26] <womreaker> whats your favourite resturant
[2023-01-10 15:43:26] <%Queza2> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway
[2023-01-10 15:43:26] <Zardak123> Instagram doesn't pay anything though, it's just vanity
[2023-01-10 15:43:26] <+Gladtobebackk> They‚Äôre are more males on twitch watching the streamers. Majority are looking at females. Simple. It‚Äôs just common math at this point üòÇ
[2023-01-10 15:43:27] <wscc1234> You are very attractive
[2023-01-10 15:43:29] <%+joeymayn> do you think its easier to be successful if you are attractive?
[2023-01-10 15:43:35] <Norbut_dyas> but they might not have a wealth in the monitary sense, but that have access to alot more social aspects of life because of their beauty
[2023-01-10 15:43:43] <greenbaybucks> I think the glass ceiling for women is because if a girl has a chat as quick as XQC the viewer won‚Äôt feel the connection/attention to the streamer so they‚Äôll just move on to a smaller girl streamer
[2023-01-10 15:43:43] <dnegzlover> so you just sit there and do nothing ??
[2023-01-10 15:43:45] <sat_0shi> what if you are a Beholder, from like D&D rule set 3.5
[2023-01-10 15:43:45] <%Alasdair> actually the majority of males on twitch are watching males
[2023-01-10 15:43:48] <wscc1234> Very seducing British accent
[2023-01-10 15:43:48] <chameleoneyes11> fair. it's just a barrier to entry and an asset you can leverage
[2023-01-10 15:43:57] <womreaker> whats the worst meal youve ever had
[2023-01-10 15:44:00] <00bondmade> being attractive is more tied in with aura and sex appeal as opposed to just being "beautiful"
[2023-01-10 15:44:05] <sebbyricho> Onions are critical to cooking leave them alone
[2023-01-10 15:44:05] <+Gladtobebackk> Females are more willing to actually post about themselves and go further to present themselves.

[2023-01-10 15:44:21] <mistergansaw> How many hours do you twitch a day?
[2023-01-10 15:44:29] <00bondmade> aura,vibes and sex appeal does more for women than just being good to look at

[2023-01-10 16:22:52] <SubSurge43> @heavymetalrules Polygamy is the practice of having multiple spouses legally, polyamory can have multiple partners you just don't marry them.

[2023-01-10 16:50:07] <@%$heavymetalrules> some are like that yeah
[2023-01-10 16:50:07] <%gardni> yep, that's what i meant by the certain type of person
[2023-01-10 16:50:10] <kylecrumpler101> You know the human brain gets off on fighting
[2023-01-10 16:50:10] <@%$heavymetalrules> it attracts that type of person
[2023-01-10 16:50:13] <Tobin> honestly ive never had issues with bouncers but maybe london is totally different
[2023-01-10 16:50:13] <BigTunaSamich> totally...bouncers love to kick ass and not get locked up
[2023-01-10 16:50:19] <luckypuki1> showing off
[2023-01-10 16:50:24] <%+Draedo_KR9> the only time you see trouble with bouncers are when some pikeys are in town. The bouncers are understandably on edge. Pikeys usually always start scraps with doormen here
[2023-01-10 16:50:24] <Norbut_dyas> no not quite, its just cuz your at such high stress you just still angry from the last altercation
[2023-01-10 16:50:27] <chameleoneyes11> some of them are also probably meatheads with no emotional intelligence
[2023-01-10 16:50:34] <%+Draedo_KR9> bouncers here that is.

[2023-01-10 16:50:47] <luckypuki1> showing off to the other bouncers
[2023-01-10 16:50:47] <kylecrumpler101> literally studies show there‚Äôs a brain part for ultimate focus in fighting and ppl get hooked on that fighting spirit
[2023-01-10 16:50:47] <+AidanAmavi> I think it boils down to the ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù or ‚Äústick‚Äù mentality of getting people to follow orders, and they believe stick is more useful, so to speak

[2023-01-10 16:58:58] <%emperorjoefranklin> you had it right blinkx.  as a bartender i;ll tell you- the bouncer had his ego hurt not long b4 hand and just took out on whomever he percieved to impress those that he felt a fool in front of

[2023-01-10 17:02:18] <%+Draedo_KR9> I did bouncing for like a very very short period like 8 years ago and I can tell you that you are on edge when you can to tell someones to leave or they can't go inside. Cause they have most likely already been drinking before they came out and for alot of people, going out at the weekend is all that have to look forward too and it's you that is now ruining their night. So I get people starting on bouncers, not really the other way around though.
[2023-01-10 17:02:38] <%+Draedo_KR9> So for the essay
[2023-01-10 17:02:38] <chameleoneyes11> it's when you put certain qualities onto somebody because they remind you of someone else

[2023-01-10 18:19:44] <+d3mxn0bo> The world is by the majority shallow, everyone dates via apps where you reject people at first glance. Work on your appearance if it bothers you.

[2023-01-10 18:21:11] <Fresh8119> Yes
[2023-01-10 18:21:11] <%+BrysLive> The label of being shallow presupposes a normalcy in mate selection being defined by others. I think it‚Äôs outrageous that other people are so entitled that they want to go so far beyond what‚Äôs ok to say what‚Äôs normative that they tell you how you should pick your partners
[2023-01-10 18:21:14] <%+LonelyAsh> is 'what is significant' fairly subjective?
