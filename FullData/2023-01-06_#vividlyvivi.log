[2023-01-06 13:29:23] <VelPepperVT> I think I got into "pog" from watching a WoW streamer. He had the most deadpan tone, and this one time he got a good roll he said "Poggers" in a tone that sounded both excited and ironic (but it was legitimately good outcome). I thought the gesture was funny, and started seeing it more. It stuck since then.

[2023-01-06 13:52:24] <Raivy> Diablo 2 was the best
[2023-01-06 13:52:29] <DRAWING_DAEMON> nice
[2023-01-06 13:52:30] <CeciHimeVT> diablo II is the GOAT but POE is still really good
[2023-01-06 13:52:33] <%ParanoidCorgi> they listen to the fans and yes D2 was the best there was nothign after that :)
[2023-01-06 13:52:38] <%gabriebob> they need your height straight away cos when they accept you they Then need to order your tracking/mocap/VR gear, which takes time to get and arrive and deliver to you, having it immediately means they can reduce delays, standard corperate approach.
[2023-01-06 13:52:41] <%Dragonator_g> The latest Diablo is disgustingly evil. They murdered the franchise with literally every possible microtransaction tactic possible.
[2023-01-06 13:52:52] <Raivy> @ParanoidCorgi We agree there was no other games after Diablo 2. Void.

[2023-01-06 13:53:17] <%MelkorTheGreat> Having a height also means they can better assign you a model that fits your proportions, since they make most of those in advance.
[2023-01-06 13:53:18] <Kenbokie> PoE is good. But PoE 2 and diablo 4 coming out this year now? raivEyes
