[2022-12-29 14:13:07] <!%$Wombat5Typhoon> it is possible to be your own grandpa if you marry a widow who already has a grown up daughter, and your father marries the widow's grown up daughter. Now the widow's daughter becomes your mother. Since your mother's mother is your wife, your wife is also your grandmother. As the husband of your grandmother, you become your own grandpa

[2022-12-29 14:35:15] <@%^StreamElements> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.

[2022-12-29 16:23:47] <%+ThePurpleDrake> he did get that on sigma UR to GM so yeah
[2022-12-29 16:23:53] <DemxnIRL> @thechits it’s a vod 🙃
[2022-12-29 16:23:59] <eliteph33r> @thechits hey its a vod, but yes, your hidden MMR is completely different than your visible SR

[2022-12-29 16:25:22] <eliteph33r> @thechits Your hidden MMR is what determines match making and its often completely diff than your visible SR. SO if the game thinks you are in GM 2, but your SR is Gold 4, you still get GM or diamonds im your lobby
[2022-12-29 16:25:46] <+Johanmoney> Why doesnt it say rerun

Now the widow's daughter becomes your mother. Since your mother's mother is your wife, your wife is also your grandmother. As the husband of your grandmother, you become your own grandpa
