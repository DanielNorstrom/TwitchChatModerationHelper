[2023-01-10 00:17:25] <@%^StreamElements> jesus it makes me sick watching this people play ddr like this. THATS NOT PLAYING DDR. holding the damn bar and barely moving your feet is not playing god damn ddr. At that point why even use the pad? just use a controller, its exactly the same level as playing ddr. either do it correctly or dont do it. otherwise you are just saying " i managed to trigger all the arrows, so i played ddr right?" do you wanna play ddr? or just trigger the arrows? they arent the same damn thing.

[2023-01-10 13:43:46] <@%Toonfish> @AchievementSlayer fun fact, foot fetishes are actually the most common kind of fetish, something like 30% of all men have one IIRC. Something about the areas of the brain that handle attraction and feet being close to each other so the wires get crossed easily
[2023-01-10 13:44:19] <%Amazhulaan> I think it was genitals and feet areas in the brain being almost paired ijpHMM
