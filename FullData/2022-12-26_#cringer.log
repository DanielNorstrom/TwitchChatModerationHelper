[2022-12-26 14:02:04] <@%$Asiak> We pump millions into climat stuff sure
[2022-12-26 14:02:05] <%SiriusSion> I think China more a bigger issue when comes to climate change
[2022-12-26 14:02:08] <@%$Asiak> but like
[2022-12-26 14:02:21] <@%$Asiak> We still let companies do whatever
[2022-12-26 14:02:23] <@%$Asiak> BUT
[2022-12-26 14:02:35] <@%$Asiak> the real question is what has Bulgaria done to stop climate change?
[2022-12-26 14:02:37] <Sten1981> The US does far more than most countries.  China for example who is the leading producer of carbon emissions in the world
[2022-12-26 14:02:52] <DiabloBG> @Asiak We are one of the only carbon negative countries out there
[2022-12-26 14:02:59] <@%$Asiak> Oh nice
[2022-12-26 14:03:06] <DiabloBG> we buy CO2 emissions from countries
[2022-12-26 14:03:12] <%+JackDeez79> Calling BS....
[2022-12-26 14:03:18] <%Desourval> I was born during a blizzard, and almost 45 years later we just had a blizzard, winter happens
[2022-12-26 14:03:22] <%+JackDeez79> Are there Humans in Bulgaria ?
[2022-12-26 14:03:23] <%ralfwan> that's very unfair @Asiak the Bulgarians cut their carbon output when they turned that light in the outside toilet off
[2022-12-26 14:03:23] <FreddiFish07> @Sten1981 yeah and the US also offloaded factories to China and has 1/4 the population, no kidding China has more emissions
[2022-12-26 14:03:29] <%+JackDeez79> THERE YOURE NOT CARBON NEGATIVE
[2022-12-26 14:03:31] <DiabloBG> Non taken LUL
[2022-12-26 14:03:36] <%SiriusSion> Thing is the US is a lot bigger then other countries that are carbon neutral
[2022-12-26 14:04:01] <Nywro> It would be 34th for size if it was a US state.

[2022-12-26 14:04:09] <%+Lord_Nuker> I'm Norwegian, and as always we want to the best in class, yet we still pump up oil and gas, and develop new oil fields...
[2022-12-26 14:04:18] <Sten1981> @FreddiFish07 only because their laws allow it and we arent the only country to have industry out there......   if they fix their laws it will fix that but they dont care
[2022-12-26 14:04:27] <%Liljagare> and those salmons.. :\
[2022-12-26 14:04:39] <%+Lord_Nuker> We are world leading in dual moralisme
[2022-12-26 14:04:51] <FreddiFish07> @Sten1981 if they fix their laws it will reduce emissions but not by a ton. remember they have half the per capita emissions of the US already so the US is doing worse
[2022-12-26 14:04:56] <DiabloBG> I understand, that is why I said, that more of America would take CC more seriously because of these happenings is all, I am not shitting on whole of Murica
[2022-12-26 14:05:43] <sn0wf1ake1> tiny Denmark here. we produce all thpse windmills
[2022-12-26 14:05:50] <DiabloBG> Don't get me wrong, unlike many of EU, I actually love a lot of America, but that is why I want to see it be a leader in all things
[2022-12-26 14:05:56] <%+AnotherJunglist> The US does a lot, but IMO when you compare what it does in comparision with the amount of wealth it has it falls behind a lot of other countries
[2022-12-26 14:06:01] <%Kalderasch> Thanks, Cringer, I just had a debate with my dad. Had enough for one day.

[2022-12-26 14:06:21] <DarkDruidSS> there is also no solid proof that if all the countries in the world went carbon negative that climate change would stop. there is also the polar shift happening that influences climate change.
[2022-12-26 14:06:38] <%+zer0sm1th> Someone apparently didn't get enough of this crap during their family reunions yesterday.....
[2022-12-26 14:06:47] <%+Lord_Nuker> @sn0wf1ake1 Norway here, we produce the gas so eu dont freeze this winter :P Hopefully we can start with some nuclear pp before the decade ends
[2022-12-26 14:06:47] <Barrh> i still find it funny when people say "america this or americans that" like all of us are the same with the same mentalities
[2022-12-26 14:06:57] <DiabloBG> @DarkDruidSS It has been proven that it is man made, I don't want to go down the conspiracy hole today
[2022-12-26 14:06:59] <%spokskid> are we going to make elfs in this run ?? like small crashed ship from elfs union
[2022-12-26 14:07:20] <%+AnotherJunglist> the western world also exports a lot of its pollution to other countries by outsourcing manufacturing and dirty industries
[2022-12-26 14:07:25] <%spokskid> or what was we called in stellaris
[2022-12-26 14:07:27] <DarkDruidSS> so the polar shift isn't happening? @diablobg

[2022-12-26 15:42:54] <%$clawzit> Dorf is more of a sim you interact with while Rim is more game imo
[2022-12-26 15:43:28] <DarkDruidSS> rimworld does give you more control in the game
[2022-12-26 15:44:20] <Tordrek_> you can mod all of that in rimworld though

[2022-12-26 15:44:56] <+Zeraeb> DF has that 3D aspect, for me that's one of the biggest differences.
[2022-12-26 15:45:05] <Agarus_Exsolutus> so you barely play dorf fortress
[2022-12-26 15:45:29] <Agarus_Exsolutus> you just watch, with barely any UI
