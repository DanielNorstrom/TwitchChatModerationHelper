[2023-01-05 04:50:27] <timewarper9000> all they had to do was just keep what they had with suicide squad and peacemaker and give them an ability to jump earths and be a hero squad and bring in the new justice leugue and make a new earth entirly but nope now its all just confusing we wont know what earth is what why batmans hear and supermans hear wtf man sadness, good thing im all about marvel aswell lol

[2023-01-05 04:56:39] <notNOTjack> @Varanid seems way more plausible that he's keeping those because he directed and/or created them and so they fit his vision for the future, rather than simple nepotism

[2023-01-05 04:59:33] <%Varanid> @Echocross94 Gunn must have made a sophisticated and convincing argument that he has a bigger story arc for all the DC characters in order for WB to keep those shows and Ezra as a pivot-point
[2023-01-05 04:59:36] <WadeDMcGinnis> That's all odd. only thing Gunn said is their slate is 8 years out. Has no info on Ezra as reported by Variety

[2023-01-05 05:00:38] <%+prfella> Synderverse's critical reception sealed its fate toward the end, and the writing was on the wall when they released the Snyder cut , because they would not have made that if they were going to continue the Snyderverse @BurkeBlack

[2023-01-05 05:02:28] <%+prfella> specifically speaking, its the focus groups, audience reception, etc. and the need to grab market share from Marvel, and almost all snyderverse projects were doing the opposite

[2023-01-05 05:02:54] <Nobiont> doesn't mean he'll write superman the same way
[2023-01-05 05:03:00] <crapnel_x> it cant just be a cost saving thing right? is gunn much cheaper?
[2023-01-05 05:03:08] <WadeDMcGinnis> @BurkeBlack No Snyder already did that version
[2023-01-05 05:03:11] <SuffocatedNYDM> Yeah WB is acting like Vince Mcmahon they only want the things they want to get over to get over if people like a thing they don't want to push things that people naturally like

[2023-01-05 05:03:36] <%Echocross94> @burkeblack didnt he say that peacemaker and shazam is the tone he's going for
[2023-01-05 05:03:46] <WadeDMcGinnis> Snyder's Batman was the wallet and the comic relief in an odd way

[2023-01-05 05:04:46] <@%BleuBelladonna> "My Spy" i think, idk how dramatic that was but
[2023-01-05 05:04:53] <notNOTjack> the Snyderverse was doomed from the start, they tried to jump the gun, piggybacking from the grittiness of the Nolan-verse, they tried to get Christian Bale back as Batman and failed and just kept scrambling to meet the MCU's success

[2023-01-05 08:00:00] <%goth_milk> @mackheaths you can make an easy mode and save scum settings to learn how to play it and then bump up difficulty i think as you learn the game. it's been awhile since i played.

[2023-01-05 09:08:20] <@%+Jigawatts42> @goth_milk I am a mage at heart NODDERS Bladesinger is my favorite 5E class Jammies
[2023-01-05 09:08:46] <%goth_milk> @Redwyrm 5e
[2023-01-05 09:08:48] <Redwyrm> Bladesinger very powerful in 5e. Wasn't as much in earlier editions
[2023-01-05 09:09:02] <@%+Jigawatts42> @goth_milk booming blade is so good
[2023-01-05 09:09:13] <@%+Jigawatts42> 2nd Edition bladesinger is also awesome
[2023-01-05 09:09:19] <+The_Pallid_Knight> i think my friend is going hexblade swashbuckler for curse of strahd
[2023-01-05 09:09:38] <%goth_milk> i really wish they'd come up with a  real necromancer class that is stand alone like wizard and warlock and not some subclass of wizard or cleric.
[2023-01-05 09:09:53] <Redwyrm> Although not even leveled, His 3 most string points: haste - Tenser Transformation - Shapechange

[2023-01-05 09:10:10] <@%+Jigawatts42> @goth_milk 3E has one, the Dread Necromancer
[2023-01-05 09:10:19] <Redwyrm> in between, those - he falling behind somewhat
[2023-01-05 09:10:56] <@%+Jigawatts42> @The_Pallid_Knight the hexblade dip is too strong, warlocks should get their subclass at level 3 :p
[2023-01-05 09:10:58] <%$JugglerMaus> DM let me make a Tabaxi Bladesinger.. could move 80 ft and attack someone
[2023-01-05 09:11:06] <%goth_milk> i loved the necromancer class in EverQuest 1 video game. Wish i could come up with a homebrew version of it to play one day.
[2023-01-05 09:11:22] <@%+Jigawatts42> Necros were the solo masters of EQ
[2023-01-05 09:11:32] <@%+Jigawatts42> they were also suprisingly good mana batteries

[2023-01-05 09:12:14] <Redwyrm> Well, that's certainly lore breaking. Elves are known to be super agressive about non-elves learning ways of bladesinger. To the point where tehy keep sending army of assasing both aagainst pupil and teacher who broke the taboo

[2023-01-05 11:29:30] <funsiesbuns> yes I would duckymouse
[2023-01-05 11:29:34] <Legatus_Damocles> @itsSpaceGh0st try returning it to honolulu or the sea teritory where u have carrier
[2023-01-05 11:29:34] <PKM4STER> wait, so im a pirate too? Kappa
[2023-01-05 11:29:36] <redentropy_> could be good to use for Armada
[2023-01-05 11:29:45] <%+itsSpaceGh0st> won't let me do either
[2023-01-05 11:29:54] <%+WastingSanity> 40k used to be mostly character battles. So it always came down to the big beefy commander or that one really hard to kill character being left on the field. Then the new iteration of the game came out shifting it to squad based battles. Gosh that was pricey to field armies at that point.
[2023-01-05 11:29:55] <%+DuckyMouse> @funsiesbuns True... I would to.. Just thinking about the anti-piracy ad
[2023-01-05 11:29:58] <PKM4STER> you can 3d print some custom models
[2023-01-05 11:30:08] <@%Mrfarside44> 3D printing custom made WH models is ok tbh
[2023-01-05 11:30:10] <%loft> @itsSpaceGh0st will it let you send it to San Fran ?

[2023-01-05 11:31:24] <%+donavanKnight> as long as its personal use i dont see an issue
[2023-01-05 11:31:35] <%+DuckyMouse> @funsiesbuns Haha... Yeah! I was the same.. Like just give me the link! I want that download
[2023-01-05 11:31:37] <%xen_mind> just dont sell them :)
[2023-01-05 11:31:39] <Redwyrm> well, as long as you not selling it - it's not illegal

[2023-01-05 11:58:43] <%501stVadersFist> The Tiger suffered from poor engineering and a transmission that was built for a lighter weight vehicle. The tiger other than its armor was actually a pretty poor design.

[2023-01-05 11:59:32] <%Redwyrm> it was very good even before war. Alas USSR had too little of those before WWII, but was main reason why German seriosly redesigned tanks to much-much heavier armored. Of course in teh end Russia also upgraded T34 to T34-85 @BurkeBlack

[2023-01-05 12:00:26] <Shivalla> Germans were bit ridiculous, they made mineboxes from steel 😂 in later stages they stopped doing it and did same as Everyone else did, made it from wood. If the steel they wasted on mineboxes they could have made alot more tanks. I saw this in a documentary where they found those steel mineboxes and laughed like idiots to it. :)

[2023-01-05 12:39:45] <+Breygor> 6mm
[2023-01-05 12:39:48] <%+Del_Einar> they like the larger models
[2023-01-05 12:39:51] <ForTheWiel> I don't know how games workshop pumps out like 5 games every year
[2023-01-05 12:40:07] <%+WastingSanity> They want to push those sales though.
[2023-01-05 12:40:11] <Chaser_Yohmoi> a few years ago they showed a stack of what they where working on and gothic and epic where in the stack, as well as gorka morka, and warmaster
[2023-01-05 12:40:13] <@%Mrfarside44> I prefer larger models imo
[2023-01-05 12:40:14] <redentropy_> There used to be a smaller scale 40K game.  Armageddon?  I don't remember
[2023-01-05 12:40:16] <Hasandil> i like a bit bigger models, i like painting but i suck at it
[2023-01-05 12:40:20] <ForTheWiel> they really use that money
[2023-01-05 12:40:48] <Chaser_Yohmoi> warmaster is to fantasy as epic is to 40k
[2023-01-05 12:41:00] <redentropy_> Bring back the square bases for fantasy
[2023-01-05 12:41:04] <ForTheWiel> is darktide better since the beta? i havent seen if it is yet

[2023-01-05 12:41:16] <%+WastingSanity> New unit types and changing up the rules so the character models are diminished in power and they can field more troops. That is how they push them sales.

[2023-01-05 13:09:37] <PKM4STER> if they could get rid of the heat issue, they would push it way further
[2023-01-05 13:09:44] <Korhazen> they are reaching a wall in tech
[2023-01-05 13:09:44] <Zethuz> heat dissipation is a far bigger problem to solve than computation speed
[2023-01-05 13:09:46] <+HornDogRooster> They ran into Moore's Law long ago
[2023-01-05 13:09:51] <%Rool_Gonzalez> just a minor vapor chamber issue on one batch,seems like @chobtt
[2023-01-05 13:09:52] <+HornDogRooster> hence lots of processors
[2023-01-05 13:09:59] <@%Mrfarside44> just look at heat sinks of 40 series crds lol
[2023-01-05 13:10:00] <funsiesbuns> they have to wait on litography, the stuff is still too big for the speeds they're trying to achieve
[2023-01-05 13:10:18] <thealltfather> GPU's cost a lot. How much it costs pr fps is incredibly high based on actual cost. What companies that scalp GPU's do is to sell them under the umbrella of bigger companies such as newegg and Amazon. Case in point, the price of a 3090 TI versus a 4070 which is around the same preformance. 3090 costs 1600 dollars VS a 4070 is around 800-900 MSRP
[2023-01-05 13:10:25] <%Malloc_III> @Mrfarside44 do they burn like a thunderbolt
[2023-01-05 13:10:36] <%+Supereeto> 4070 price is a joke
[2023-01-05 13:10:42] <PKM4STER> cloud gaming is the future for me personally. with the internet speeds you have all over the world. its definitely possible
[2023-01-05 13:10:45] <%JoshuaColossus> It is the future
[2023-01-05 13:11:00] <%kimba274> its easy, start a new campaign on how the human eye can't process more than 24fps and we are all set with 1060s ^^

[2023-01-05 13:11:45] <+HornDogRooster> Cloud computing in general is the future for computing on planet Earth, but once we go out into the solar system, it won't work well with the problems with speed of light, so then you have to make more  clouds on other planets

[2023-01-05 13:12:53] <%Spidersfury> Isn't Axis & Allies a notoriously slow (and sometimes incredibly boring)? The board game can take 6+ hours. Is this a game worthy of a stream considering how slow it is?
