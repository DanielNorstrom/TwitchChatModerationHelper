[2022-12-16 02:17:29] <%+Fail_Snail> The thing about Xenoblade 3's OST is that each track is dynamic and has different parts that change depending on the circumstances. They haven't even released an official OST for it because it would be like literally 10 hours of music
[2022-12-16 02:17:32] <%Ikario> @HUNK4 thank you so much, I'm stressed as fuck

[2022-12-16 02:34:11] <%pigmanny> playing it 1 hour a day was chill
[2022-12-16 02:34:15] <%thejumpingmouse> Talos Principle was a better Witness anyway. At least the weird philosophy stuff felt better? idk why though.
[2022-12-16 02:34:16] <%Ikario> it gets too old doing variations of line puzzles for sooo long
[2022-12-16 02:34:18] <%Mugzippit> its like a book of crosswords puzzles. if your into it then its tons of content
[2022-12-16 02:34:21] <%$JoeyGripps> so yu did not see the post credit scene then

[2022-12-16 02:34:23] <%+Troll_Ascetic> screw that game
[2022-12-16 02:34:26] <%Buflen> i took my time with it, had 3-4 puzzles everyday, and had a great time
[2022-12-16 02:34:27] <%yelnats248> Is this cult of the lamb music? The soundtrack is so good
[2022-12-16 02:34:27] <%+odym82> After the exact same puzzle for the 20th time i was done
[2022-12-16 02:34:28] <%$Eomund_01> witness clicked with me a little better, I was also hard-up for any kind of puzzle games
[2022-12-16 02:34:33] <%Specter963> the witness over stays it welcome
[2022-12-16 02:34:37] <focusonmeplay> Hey barb I know you played Elden Ring but did you go for full completion?
[2022-12-16 02:34:39] <%$bigvin81> i really liked it until i attempted to 100% it.  then it was REALLLLLY tedious LUL
[2022-12-16 02:34:40] <%Miser_Mask> @JoeyGripps nope he did not
[2022-12-16 02:34:43] <%PonysPlace> @pigmanny yeah same for Baba is You. couldnt imagine playing it 5+ hours, let alone stream it

[2022-12-16 02:34:56] <%$FrozenEnzyme> the puzzles aren't all identical in talos

[2022-12-16 02:35:02] <%Topgun486> baba is you is best is puzzle
[2022-12-16 02:35:05] <%+cycr0s> that puzzle game announced at the game awards looked super interesting. think it was called viewfinder?
[2022-12-16 02:35:10] <%$JoeyGripps> @JoeyGripps Sadge @Miser_Mask
[2022-12-16 02:35:11] <+rajjah15> Can you hide a block that you need to hit with the ones you throw to get in the secret area?
[2022-12-16 02:35:12] <trenosuk> The witness was like what? And the Talos Principle was like why?
[2022-12-16 02:35:13] <%O_Luke> It's possible to beat Baba Is You without spending too much time on it. Getting 100% is long.
[2022-12-16 02:35:28] <%Buflen> @FrozenEnzyme and they arent identical in the witness
[2022-12-16 02:35:28] <+Cornsqueeznz> Just got my steam deck today, it's pretty sweet.
[2022-12-16 02:35:29] <%drgnrave> @thejumpingmouse I think they are just different games though, so I feel like they are hard to compare. There are some similarities like puzzles in the environment, which The Witness leans in to more.
[2022-12-16 02:35:30] <+Trask07> well the Witness did make one guy mad enough to make a parody game of it
[2022-12-16 02:35:39] <DevazureBlue> Was peeping at that overworld a little while ago, it's looking cute chambo2Gasp
[2022-12-16 02:35:54] <%$jqck_89> Witness was a good Harrison Ford movie

[2022-12-16 02:36:30] <%$bigvin81> you're mixing up The Witness and The Client LUL

[2022-12-16 02:36:53] <%Magnatux> of "one type of puzzle" games, Talos is better than Witness. Neither one is "myst like" lol. Check out Quern for a good myst like

[2022-12-16 03:10:26] <shdwstar2420> To be fair it’s not much to spoil about Ragnarok
[2022-12-16 03:10:27] <%thejumpingmouse> I'm going to try and avoid spoilers until GoWR hits PC.
[2022-12-16 03:10:29] <%$Marcupp> what's your favorite color? :)

[2022-12-16 03:10:36] <%+fatedfox> whats your favorite color????
[2022-12-16 03:10:39] <%LadyEnvy_> @gabdrinks on MOST demanding games you can think about about 2-3 hours of play, on less demanding I think 6?
[2022-12-16 03:10:43] <%$Marcupp> that's a low part of the ENTIRE SERIES
[2022-12-16 03:10:43] <%+WeegeeBored> This beat made me think this was CBAT for a split second. barbLUL
[2022-12-16 03:10:47] <%oddwalls> giant stuff barbCrungo
[2022-12-16 03:10:49] <%$Definitely_Alive> that felt like a side quest someone said "yo make this a main quest" and won the arguement.
[2022-12-16 03:10:49] <%RhannoThePainter> That part was so long and useless
[2022-12-16 03:10:52] <%+zaffenmike> Giant stuff!
[2022-12-16 03:10:52] <%$TheGhostPhoenix10> That section alone brings down the overall score lmao smh
[2022-12-16 03:10:53] <%+zokered> I haven’t gotten the game yet because I don’t want to does the Atreus
[2022-12-16 03:10:54] <%+llauma_> The Norns were also so fucking lame and pointless
[2022-12-16 03:10:55] <%$rafaelgonca> giant stuff

[2022-12-16 03:11:23] <PaulBlartgoestoFartMart_> the norns were dumb and useless
[2022-12-16 03:11:26] <%$TheGhostPhoenix10> Sounds like they needed a plot device and said fuck it Atreus gf

[2022-12-16 03:11:35] <%Sorrowless_Joe> there were so many side storylines that just were half formed
[2022-12-16 03:11:36] <@%$DanTheVP> Ragnarok was like Marvel Endgame, but remove all the lead-in movies that build character stories and motivations
[2022-12-16 03:11:45] <%$teddyb20> Does anybody know why the dolphins have like a block in the middle of them? Is that a Lunar magic thing?
[2022-12-16 03:11:51] <%$detdu> Kind of felt like they wanted to cram everything left of norse myth into the game
[2022-12-16 03:11:54] <%$macdreinthebae> @Marcupp yeah I think it was an excellent addition to his "wepertoire" Kappa
[2022-12-16 03:11:56] <ronaldrage> so many cool ideas in smw nowadays

[2022-12-16 03:12:27] <%$corignis> am I allowed to type spoilers? because I want to give my thoughts on Thor and Odin
[2022-12-16 03:12:29] <%+zokered> Ragnarok could have been two games
[2022-12-16 03:12:31] <%dingusbingus655> hey chat hey barb
[2022-12-16 03:12:31] <%$detdu> I liked that gow 4 used norse myth more sparingly, and made it into it's own thing
[2022-12-16 03:12:36] <%DoctorBlowfly> used car salesmen Odin and his magic mask
[2022-12-16 03:12:46] <%$Mr_Monop> I walked away from the Angroboda area thinking “man, I wish they left me wanting more of her in the game rather than…this”
[2022-12-16 03:12:46] <%+BougiePower> the spear was GREAT addition
[2022-12-16 03:12:46] <%$teddyb20> @corignis think he just ok’d taking the blinders off

[2022-12-16 03:12:59] <ronaldrage> been a while. what your thoughts on hades 2 trailer barb?
[2022-12-16 03:12:59] <%Buflen> npc spoiling puzzles
[2022-12-16 03:13:00] <%+zokered> It would have been better if it was two separate games and both halves were developed more
[2022-12-16 03:13:05] <%$BuryTheNight> @KoltonMcCombo my b, i meant to respond to werewolve
[2022-12-16 03:13:07] <%$macdreinthebae> but for 4 wasn't Barlog the head producer or something and stepped down for 5 to be the creative producer?
[2022-12-16 03:13:08] <%$Mi4_Slayer> GoW 4 story was a story that reached me on so many levels ... but ragnarok is like... barbWut
[2022-12-16 03:13:13] <%+llauma_> Did you like the Draupnir Spear and the way it got forged?
[2022-12-16 03:13:13] <shdwstar2420> One shot by lizard man was my problem
[2022-12-16 03:13:20] <%$trenchiest> We got the classic metroided so at least it knows its tropes and uses them well
[2022-12-16 03:13:30] <%+earthlydarkness> I liked the gameplay but I didn’t like the story or really how it ended cause it feels like there won’t be any more
[2022-12-16 03:13:32] <%Vaelstraza> Brother! You're covered in bifrost!!
[2022-12-16 03:13:41] <%$corignis> I thought it was weird how such a big deal was made about Ragnarok but then basically very part of Ragnarok was averted - Odin kills Thor instead of Jormungandr and Thor mutually killing each other, Fenrir has nothing to do with Odin dying,
[2022-12-16 03:13:44] <%echoesoflight_> How many episodes are left in GOW for youtube?
[2022-12-16 03:13:44] <%$namelessthree> It was so long and nothing happens
[2022-12-16 03:13:48] <%$corignis> like why use Ragnarok but abandon all the key notes of Ragnarok story
[2022-12-16 03:13:51] <%+TheGamingSwampcat> this song goes amazing with the stage
[2022-12-16 03:13:54] <%$azrael_dr> aw, this is such a sweet level, you have a dolphin friend with you
[2022-12-16 03:13:56] <%$burntotears> @earthlydarkness there wasn't meant to be
[2022-12-16 03:14:04] <%+llauma_> @barbarousking Did you like the Draupnir Spear and the way it got forged? It was the best part of the game for me
[2022-12-16 03:14:11] <gupagrump> hoping for hope
[2022-12-16 03:14:14] <%$corignis> Baldr also didn't get his actual ragnarok story, did he?
[2022-12-16 03:14:24] <%+corndogjoe> The underwater lady
[2022-12-16 03:14:29] <%+zokered> The Ragnarok event itself should have felt epic but it was rushed and underwhelming
[2022-12-16 03:14:30] <%+lamda00> The mermaid
[2022-12-16 03:14:33] <%waffle_irony> it seems like they built levels first and put story in the levels second
[2022-12-16 03:14:35] <%Nufi_ChanDussy> I hoped for game to be better Kappa
[2022-12-16 03:14:51] <%$Marcupp> because it exploded when you commanded

[2022-12-16 03:14:59] <%+llauma_> Yeah, that doesn't make sense KEKW
[2022-12-16 03:15:00] <%backtothedrawingboard3> in the fight do you even have to use exclusively the spear?
[2022-12-16 03:15:04] <%+shaoshao_> the vibrations of the spear throw off his senses
[2022-12-16 03:15:08] <%$Marcupp> like you leave it as "traps" and he couldn't predict it, yeah it was very lame
[2022-12-16 03:15:09] <%$Definitely_Alive> yeah, that fight didn't land.
[2022-12-16 03:15:10] <rabidwombat311> they tied the spear to Brok learning his soul is fractured, all too smushed together

[2022-12-16 03:15:21] <%Taniel2Shot_> It made no sense that he couldn't forsee the explosion
[2022-12-16 03:15:21] <%+BougiePower> story justification was weak, but you got a spear out of it
[2022-12-16 03:15:29] <%$Mi4_Slayer> Kratos in cutscene landed his first blow with his fist iirc @BarbarousKing so it makes less sense
[2022-12-16 03:15:38] <%+boclfon479> i Will say though, the spear was a nice addition to his weapon roster and had a unique style compared to the blades and axe
[2022-12-16 03:15:38] <%barbToxic> clongs barbGabnon
[2022-12-16 03:15:43] <%$Marcupp> they had to come up with a justification for the spear, which was a very cool weapon, but the justification sucked

[2022-12-16 03:16:02] <%Taniel2Shot_> The stupidest thing was that after using the spear once the blades were better against him

[2022-12-16 03:17:07] <%$Marcupp> yeah they didn't even pull a switcheroo with kratos "almost" dying, they just kinda forgot that
[2022-12-16 03:17:08] <%$probird5> The spear for heimdall did not make any sense
[2022-12-16 03:17:11] <%+lamda00> I heard the next pantheon might be japan or egypt
[2022-12-16 03:17:16] <%scarytopiary> right, gotta say the spear was a fun combat alternative

[2022-12-16 03:19:02] <%box_chan_> they really had to make an effort to put atreus in the right

[2022-12-16 03:19:22] <%DoctorBlowfly> playing as atreus was such a slog

[2022-12-16 03:20:12] <%AbyssalProx> Tried to expand, ended up with shallow story lines. GOW4 story is water tight
[2022-12-16 03:20:16] <%Crizzle777> I feel like it's an industry problem where unless you follow the "rules" of story telling you won't get hired

[2022-12-16 03:24:23] <hallow1880> The opening scene with thor and odin was great

[2022-12-16 03:25:44] <%$ChooobaFuccstick> Not gonna lie, the fact that ONLY Brok died in the game was so spineless. Have the balls to kill major characters if you’re going to set the stage that way

[2022-12-16 03:26:06] <%+geedub89> they had three things, ragnarok must happen, Atreus must leave, and brok had to die. That was the basis of the story
[2022-12-16 03:26:08] <%$ManofShadows> Punished Sindri was one of the few character arcs I enjoyed
[2022-12-16 03:26:15] <%$ornamentalpotat0> me too.
[2022-12-16 03:26:18] <%+llauma_> Now I remember how good the final reveals for Metroid Dread were. The fucking IA being obviously evil shocked me more than it should.

[2022-12-16 03:26:21] <%Khatun_> yeah
[2022-12-16 03:26:25] <%+Manonfire387> But isn't the whole point of God of War the fallacy of man?

[2022-12-16 03:26:35] <gabdrinks> I Remember you playing the game some part you say " SHE LIKES ALL THE COLLORS " hahaha
[2022-12-16 03:26:36] <shdwstar2420> Then Sindri becomes a little
[2022-12-16 03:26:39] <theBonestorm> I thought GOW4 story was overrated as well, but definitely better than Ragnarok
[2022-12-16 03:26:40] <%wolftickets88> smok couldn't have loved it more so it's just subjective but I agreed with you
[2022-12-16 03:26:41] <%baconinyourface> Would 1 tile pits work in that section?
[2022-12-16 03:26:41] <%stikzi> sequels do that 90% of the time
[2022-12-16 03:26:44] <%$andr0ne_> @charkal which one? horror or michael keaton?

[2022-12-16 03:27:04] <Placenta_Jerky> you probably hate the ending of game of thrones as well
[2022-12-16 03:27:08] <hallow1880> GOW 4: Tyr was an amazing character to dream of...  He traveled worlds created beautiful vaults... rebelled against odin..... GOW Rag:  Tyr was such a SoyBoy
[2022-12-16 03:27:11] <%Crizzle777> but god of war 2018 is in of itself a sequel
[2022-12-16 03:27:13] <shdwstar2420> My strimmer no option
[2022-12-16 03:27:14] <%+mistletoe_man> best MGS story? Snake Eater?
[2022-12-16 03:27:18] <%+llauma_> I liked Ragnarok and I can get behind it's flaws. But the game is very flawed.
[2022-12-16 03:27:20] <%charkal> The old claymation Jack Frost
[2022-12-16 03:27:25] <gabdrinks> Its there a confirmation of a sequel in the nordic place?

[2022-12-16 03:27:30] <%+darkart800> @Placenta_Jerky pretty sure the ending of GoT is universally disliked
[2022-12-16 03:27:31] <%DylanR251> @toadflaxhc I'd say a lot of these sentiments were echoed when he was playing the game too
[2022-12-16 03:27:32] <%$andr0ne_> @charkal oh nvm. haha

[2022-12-16 03:27:56] <%+llauma_> At least the Better Call Saul ending was good
[2022-12-16 03:27:58] <%$corignis> Sindri hating Kratos and Boy because of Brok's death was so stupid and contrived
[2022-12-16 03:28:05] <%$andr0ne_> snake eater is fantastic

[2022-12-16 03:28:07] <%+lbs0219> The Kratos emotional moments of Rag carried the game for me

[2022-12-16 03:31:07] <%+Cristophlyz> i thought about it more after hearing your 7 rating of it, and i think the biggest thing for me, is the Death of Brok just started EVERYTHING getting wrapped up at 10x speed
[2022-12-16 03:31:08] <%$CapnQuark> also, punching Zeus in the face repeatedly for as long as you wish...
[2022-12-16 03:31:11] <%dgomezzzzz> @BarbarousKing it also won the music award
[2022-12-16 03:31:12] <%$3volver> Tunic deserved to win Indie

[2022-12-16 03:31:20] <%walkingbyself> Only the originals let you beat zeus into a bloody pulp or let you cut a guys legs off to get his shoes or cut a guys head off to use it as a flash light
[2022-12-16 03:31:21] <theBonestorm> What fucking narrative KEKM

[2022-12-16 03:31:34] <%Miser_Mask> I don't think GoW should have won anything except voice acting
[2022-12-16 03:31:34] <ItzaMeLuigi> and xenoblade deserved it over everything else
[2022-12-16 03:31:36] <%HeyMisterJack> i do too and i'm totally not biased :)
[2022-12-16 03:31:42] <%+Cristophlyz> Xenoblade 3 has excellent music
[2022-12-16 03:31:44] <%esto416> You knew it would win best music when they opened the show with that... performance.
[2022-12-16 03:31:46] <%+llauma_> @cristophlyz That was known from the myth since the original one
[2022-12-16 03:31:50] <random5765> AAA games mostly have trumpets and violins trying to sound tense
[2022-12-16 03:31:51] <%+Manonfire387> Z
[2022-12-16 03:31:52] <%+lamda00> @Cristophlyz apparently thor sent him back
[2022-12-16 03:32:00] <%+Manonfire387> Xenoblade chronicles 3 was robbed
[2022-12-16 03:32:00] <%$GreenFerret95> there's some people who don't like metal hell singer music
[2022-12-16 03:32:04] <%+Cristophlyz> i mean, even if you KNOW thats how it happened, you didnt see like any of it
[2022-12-16 03:32:07] <%slairf> wait we talking about the game awards show?
[2022-12-16 03:32:11] <randomname2431> still better then when botw won music
[2022-12-16 03:32:14] <%slairf> how about that chick with the rug on
[2022-12-16 03:32:16] <sexygrandma11> Flute guy should’ve got the music award.
[2022-12-16 03:32:17] <%+Cristophlyz> and Thor got done dirty for the growth they were building him up for
[2022-12-16 03:32:22] <%$CapnQuark> whoa dude!
[2022-12-16 03:32:23] <%+lamda00> @Cristophlyz yeah I was dissapointed about that as well
[2022-12-16 03:32:23] <%+llauma_> @cristophlyz True... And Thor is supposed to go back in time too
[2022-12-16 03:32:28] <%$CapnQuark> that's sick
[2022-12-16 03:32:29] <%$andr0ne_> BotW does some really cool stuff with the music to be fair
[2022-12-16 03:32:32] <%m0nkeys> Would you say gow ragnarok was mid?
[2022-12-16 03:32:40] <anomrac21> fish
[2022-12-16 03:32:40] <%$Coelacanth88> We listening to the Cult of the Lamb ost?
[2022-12-16 03:32:40] <%$Tiger_Lotus> i think metal hellsinger should have won as well
[2022-12-16 03:32:41] <shdwstar2420> Yeah Thor growth was horrible .
[2022-12-16 03:32:49] <Placenta_Jerky> i liked elden ring but stray really should have won game of the year
[2022-12-16 03:32:54] <gabdrinks> About Final bosses, in gow2 its like " DAMM I GONNA FIGHT ZEUS " in ragnarok its like " ok Odin" maybe they use odin too much
[2022-12-16 03:33:04] <%walkingbyself> They rushed the end of the game as they had no idea wtf they wanted to do to end it.
[2022-12-16 03:33:08] <%HeyMisterJack> the growth is thor rebuked odin, though probably executed poorly
[2022-12-16 03:33:10] <shdwstar2420> Stray should not have won game of the year
[2022-12-16 03:33:12] <%+lbs0219> Felt COVID rushed
[2022-12-16 03:33:12] <%+Cristophlyz> i felt the Mask was a Shamalayan twist, and that burned me

[2022-12-16 03:33:19] <Explosiveyoshi> Kratos character development was good
[2022-12-16 03:33:20] <%PonysPlace> same with Baldur kinda in the first one. same attacks plus some gimmicks
[2022-12-16 03:33:27] <%+Mr_Mori> "Executed" poorly LUL
[2022-12-16 03:33:34] <%$DruncleTim> It was problematic
[2022-12-16 03:33:35] <%+llauma_> Freyr is the weakest point

[2022-12-16 03:33:36] <%+lbs0219> Like when all the other characters unite the realms for you...seemed odd
[2022-12-16 03:33:38] <%TheStaticRezChannel> I mean Balder wasn't much a fight
[2022-12-16 03:33:38] <hallow1880> For sure the end was worst
[2022-12-16 03:33:40] <%$TheOnlyBall> At the end, at least Sindri was still playing God of War

[2022-12-16 03:33:43] <shdwstar2420> Birgir!!!!
[2022-12-16 03:33:43] <%box_chan_> it was very "avengers, assemble"
[2022-12-16 03:33:44] <%HeyMisterJack> @Mr_Mori yes, literally :)

[2022-12-16 03:33:57] <shdwstar2420> Birgir MVP
[2022-12-16 03:34:00] <%walkingbyself> At least with Baulder you built up to his fight at the end. Thor and Odin were just, there.
[2022-12-16 03:34:01] <%$3volver> baldur just changed flavors
[2022-12-16 03:34:09] <%Mr_Gowen> The ending just simply wasn't nearly as clever as the writers thought it was
[2022-12-16 03:34:10] <Placenta_Jerky> i really liked hiemdall as a villan

[2022-12-16 03:34:21] <%+lbs0219> Did you like Draupnir? I hated it at first, but it grew on me during musleheim trials
[2022-12-16 03:34:22] <%steves_garage> oh yes a mechanic also used in a game from 1998

[2022-12-16 03:34:34] <hallow1880> It was such a story rich moment with Freya and the titan and everything... Baldur was awesome
[2022-12-16 03:34:38] <%+llauma_> Did you resonate with Freyr's sacrifice? barbToxic
[2022-12-16 03:34:49] <%fight_this> axe is actually pretty great if you get permafrost off

[2022-12-16 03:34:55] <%$aliveohiosky> i pretty much never used the axe in ragnarok
[2022-12-16 03:34:56] <%+Renaldo_Moon> i really dont understand why they made thors hammer the collectors edition statue when it played no part in the game at all
[2022-12-16 03:34:58] <%$3volver> why didn't we get to use the hammer, I feel like that's a missed opportunity

[2022-12-16 03:36:26] <shdwstar2420> To be fair the Other characters had moments they talked about things off mission

[2022-12-16 04:24:57] <%kumakumaman> The same way I can sell you a mod kit for your kia to supercharge it - you can sell a kit to modify an existing product

[2022-12-16 04:25:18] <%Phronesis59> 100% Nintendo already tried and failed to shut down hacks
[2022-12-16 04:25:19] <%$reservoir_dawgs> If barb was to sell the game then he could be taken down by Nintendo

[2022-12-16 04:25:26] <%+darkart800> I think nintendo has problems with hacks as well
[2022-12-16 04:25:27] <%+Ragonk_Force> romhacks are unequivocally legal as long as nobody is selling anything
[2022-12-16 04:25:30] <%kumakumaman> No nintendo tried in the early 2000s and lost in court.  They can no more stop patches/romhacks than BMW can stop someone selling a lift kit
[2022-12-16 04:25:30] <%buttercupsupreme1> they prioritize shitting on the smash community
[2022-12-16 04:25:31] <%$Rswindell> It's a mod for a pc game.
[2022-12-16 04:25:32] <cowa321> what about with that fan made pokemon game they DMCA'd?
[2022-12-16 04:25:33] <%TheBigDaddyDiesel> Splatoon 4 takes priority
[2022-12-16 04:25:42] <%+Cosmic_Wormface> @reservoir_dawgs That shit would get shut down the second that idea left his brain
[2022-12-16 04:25:42] <%jdero> It’s not really any different than playing as Shrek in GTA
[2022-12-16 04:25:49] <+eezye> the ROM 'hack' is the instructions for how to re-arrange the original ROM
[2022-12-16 04:26:05] <%$KiD_ViD> hacks are patches. If you own a legal copy of smw, you can do whatever you want to the code
[2022-12-16 04:26:11] <%+Manonfire387> @kumakumaman Have you heard of John Deere?
[2022-12-16 04:26:14] <%+mokinooch> legally you also have to own a physical copy of super Mario world
[2022-12-16 04:26:14] <%drkirienko> they also don't understand transformative use
[2022-12-16 04:26:16] <%$TheLegaia> Nintendo is going send Barb a ultimatum soon. Go see our Super Mario Movie or get shut down
[2022-12-16 04:26:17] <%MeekRhino> @cowa321 that is a game distributed not as a patch, but as a complete game you install on your PC.  Completely different
[2022-12-16 04:26:18] <%thejumpingmouse> I think there's some precedence that scares Nintendo away from trying to take them to court.
[2022-12-16 04:26:18] <%$viochemist> GPW3, now with micro transactions 😁
[2022-12-16 04:26:19] <ctstalker> most ppl have never patched their rom and played any of these lolz
[2022-12-16 04:26:19] <gabdrinks> If you sell for like 50 cents its still ilegal right:?
[2022-12-16 04:26:22] <%JimMcCrud> I mean, we're still propping up SMW decades after it's release
[2022-12-16 04:26:30] <%$BytePorter> right, it's like you're selling stickers to put over someone's painting
[2022-12-16 04:26:30] <%Magnatux> wasn't there somebody that sold their hack recently and got legally obliterated?
[2022-12-16 04:26:34] <%steves_garage> Zelda randomizers are the same thing
[2022-12-16 04:26:34] <KELBER0S> its like the mods in mount and blade
[2022-12-16 04:26:34] <%+Cosmic_Wormface> That would be a HUGE no-no
[2022-12-16 04:26:35] <%$MDBattleFrog> the game genie case they lost basically cements hacks as legal
[2022-12-16 04:26:36] <%$BytePorter> er not selling
[2022-12-16 04:26:38] <thugalahad> yeah even how you explained it I don't understand still new to it I kinda get it
[2022-12-16 04:26:38] <%Phronesis59> But what if you own a copy that you lost 20 years ago?
[2022-12-16 04:26:43] <%$BytePorter> I was typing while you read LUL

[2022-12-16 04:27:02] <%$KiD_ViD> IIRC the legal precedent came when Game Genie was taken to court
[2022-12-16 04:27:04] <%SeeDoubleU> Just like how the Nexus Mods site can function. Many, many mods, no games
[2022-12-16 04:27:05] <%+WilyBomby> If any creator would try to sell a hak, I believe something would break for smw communities
[2022-12-16 04:27:07] <%+earthlydarkness> Nintendo is gonna send Larry bowser to break barbs legs

[2022-12-16 04:27:12] <Ali0510> technically the only thing Nintendo can do is go after hacks for the use of IP but then people would just change Mario's sprite

[2022-12-16 04:27:18] <%Ginjaneer> A hack is the same thing as a mod is for any other game. It’s modifying the base game which you bought to be somewhat or in this case entirely different.
[2022-12-16 04:27:22] <%KoJi_64> how much for a gpw3 nft tho
[2022-12-16 04:27:26] <%kumakumaman> @Manonfire387 The difference is a strong contract vs a TOS, and john deere even just bricks stuff or removes warranties, basically DRM.  They cant successfully sue someone who DOES fix their equipment - just stop supporting if if you use them
[2022-12-16 04:27:30] <+BrainstormLaw> Nintendo lost on romhacking when they went after the Game Genie for copyright infringement in the 90s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Galoob_Toys,_Inc._v._Nintendo_of_America,_Inc.

[2022-12-16 04:41:55] <+thanatosia> It's 100% not your fault because the campaign needs to be better designed, but you are way overleveled from when I watched.
[2022-12-16 04:41:57] <%+Dradow> all 10 acts are basically just a tutorial, it doesn't really get hard until afterwards.. before that it's mainly tedious and arguably it's tedious afterwards as well depending on how you play the game
[2022-12-16 04:42:00] <%gcobes> aurGasm
[2022-12-16 04:42:00] <%$SuperLongRoad> a new player will probably start having trouble at the end of act 3

[2022-12-16 04:42:35] <%+BradBrown> the big issue is you're killing everything. you need to start skipping mobs to get to the harder stuff. you've over leveled yourself
[2022-12-16 04:42:38] <%$sloth_moves> thats a dope level
[2022-12-16 04:42:50] <Botecelli> Evening m’Barb hope you are fresh
[2022-12-16 04:42:50] <%$SuperLongRoad> the end of act 4 can be pretty rough for new players

[2022-12-16 04:42:53] <+dad0118> Gpw3 close?
[2022-12-16 04:42:54] <dropdizzle> @KELBER0S you can just not upgrade your armor and weapons if you want MH to kick your ass
[2022-12-16 04:42:58] <%+GlaceonYo> Yeah, they removed the difficulties

[2022-12-16 04:43:36] <%OOOO_Sebby> that's just how top players play to get to end game because they've done everything you're doing 100+ times
[2022-12-16 04:43:37] <%+OgrefromMT> You've probably had your eyes open when playing.  Noob
[2022-12-16 04:43:37] <%+senorschmu> it just like in Wargames
[2022-12-16 04:43:39] <%fausty1> i mean early game yes.. just do the objectives

[2022-12-16 04:43:58] <%$Belanon> POE isn't about the acts, its about end game
[2022-12-16 04:43:58] <Lainilly> why not instead make the early game interesting?
