[2023-01-03 05:17:23] <%$nemafow> Yeah I understand it happens, guess I just dont like it thrown in my face
[2023-01-03 05:17:27] <%XIII_Aether> Like the whole leve?
[2023-01-03 05:17:30] <%nerdsquid> jesus
[2023-01-03 05:17:30] <%In_Amber_Klad> There is a worse level in development
[2023-01-03 05:17:30] <%XIII_Aether> Level*
[2023-01-03 05:17:36] <%FallenAngel0103> wow thats weird
[2023-01-03 05:17:36] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> Gooood working on Magic deck, takin a break from art since my headache is comin back
[2023-01-03 05:17:44] <dopsrogue> It is kinda fucked up but I like that they are willing do delve into some deep stuff
[2023-01-03 05:17:45] <%XIII_Aether> Damn. Hopefully they have a toggle to opt out of those levels tbh
[2023-01-03 05:17:55] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> also wow, fr that's fucked up
[2023-01-03 05:18:04] <%XIII_Aether> Games being realistic is good but it doesn‚Äôt have to go THAT far
[2023-01-03 05:18:11] <%DatingDaysDruid> i know this game is suposed to be realistic but how "realistic" does a game need to be
[2023-01-03 05:18:15] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> yeaah, it's just staving off the migraine it wants to be lol
[2023-01-03 05:18:24] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> so like it's WORKING but also
[2023-01-03 05:18:26] <+Riku_WG> It'd be nice to have a toggle in the options like  grounded's arachnophobia mode. Let players choose how much shit they wanna see
[2023-01-03 05:18:31] <%FallenAngel0103> yea like we understand it happens but like. we dont want a cop simulator to have taht
[2023-01-03 05:18:32] <%haiddon> sometimes realism can get fucked
[2023-01-03 05:18:38] <%FallenAngel0103> at least put it as a toggle
[2023-01-03 05:18:47] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> PAIN PAIN
[2023-01-03 05:18:54] <%FallenAngel0103> i love realism but man thats alittle too far
[2023-01-03 05:19:03] <%$nemafow> A toggle, so those that wanna try it can, those that dont wanna, dont need ot
[2023-01-03 05:19:09] <!%$CoopKaiju> It‚Äôs a tight line to keep of art reflecting life. For games, escapism is still the core function
[2023-01-03 05:19:10] VIEWERS: 275
[2023-01-03 05:19:17] <%sergeantlexy> There‚Äôs realism but some things are unnecessary
[2023-01-03 05:19:28] <dopsrogue> I think just a warning on the levels would be fine, then the toggle is just you deciding to go in or not
[2023-01-03 05:19:46] <%$nemafow> The gameplay looks sick
[2023-01-03 05:20:14] <dopsrogue> It's very hard Nema, that's what I've found out
[2023-01-03 05:21:04] <%$nemafow> I enjoy hard; but I just cant put money towards something that includes these kind of things; vote with my wallet if you will

[2023-01-03 05:30:37] <YaBoiSkeletorr> might have to commission a revengeance modder to make it
[2023-01-03 05:30:40] <%XIII_Aether> I know that silver vale has essentially herself in Skyrim so you‚Äôd have to have a full model to start! I bet it can work. Replace his voice lines with random quotes LUL

[2023-01-03 08:17:44] <adxadan> It's annoying going to the vape shop and having to tip just to hand me a vape.
[2023-01-03 08:17:45] <%$nemafow> Tipping is stupid, pay your employees what they are worth
[2023-01-03 08:17:51] <%nerdsquid> yeah it would be nice if service workers got paid min wage at least

[2023-01-03 08:18:27] <@%$willrob87> there should never have been an "ok" thing to pay someone less than min wage thinking they get tips
[2023-01-03 08:18:42] <!%+operatorviera> I don't tip here cos we have min wage
[2023-01-03 08:18:48] <%$nemafow> I feel like it should be illegal
[2023-01-03 08:18:49] <adxadan> I just don't understand why I need to tip when I go to Dave and Busters and the worker is sitting on their butt and just ringing us out

[2023-01-03 08:19:43] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> more places are setting up tips as an option literally because they're playing off the food industry, and just NOT paying their workers enough, make the minimum wage a livable wage again like it was SUPPOSED to be
[2023-01-03 08:19:43] <!%Morpheuss__> BET I CAN

[2023-01-03 08:20:33] <$that_bly> the point of minimum wage is that it should be a living wage which it is currently far from
[2023-01-03 08:20:42] <%FallenAngel0103> @Morpheuss__ WHY NOT DISNEY IS AWESOME
[2023-01-03 08:20:45] <adxadan> Sometimes I wish that companies just paid their workers good
[2023-01-03 08:20:50] <%FallenAngel0103> RIGHT?
[2023-01-03 08:20:50] <!%Morpheuss__> Oh
[2023-01-03 08:20:52] <!%Morpheuss__> Okay then
[2023-01-03 08:20:53] <%$BobaManZz> ah, this reminds me. there was a bartender who asked her boss if she was gonna get tipped, he immediately called her out saying that the customer just sat down, she caught an attitude and refused to even serve him a drink without ANY cause. so even if he did tip (and which he didn't) it would've went to the company for her bad service

[2023-01-03 08:21:38] <adxadan> What about Florida?
[2023-01-03 08:21:39] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> like I said, more and more industries are making tips required for their workers since minimum wage is SO far behind, and inflation iss insane, and that way they just, don't have to change anything and pay their workers a living wage
[2023-01-03 08:21:56] <+Kn0ckavelli> Lmao cali is something

[2023-01-03 08:23:03] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> In the US a livable wage is a little under 30$ accounting for inflation basing it on cost of living

[2023-01-03 08:37:44] <%Jaccquee> I don't think it's really right to group generations into a generalization, and while sometimes it can be accurate, it's very incomplete

[2023-01-03 08:39:12] <%$nemafow> Zoomers only care about themselves, they aint gonna change shit
[2023-01-03 08:39:16] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> lol you could say all this shit about any generation and people would agree, generational shit is stupid, everyone struggled with different things at different times, no one had it easier or harder we all have random lots of shit or good, and generalizing generations doesn't change shit but make you sound stupid spitting out media click bait lines
