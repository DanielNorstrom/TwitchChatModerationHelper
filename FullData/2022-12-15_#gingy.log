[2022-12-15 18:56:11] <yellowhaddock1> afternoon ma'am
[2022-12-15 18:56:15] <bavarian_beerhunter> how do u level up endurance with a sniper?
[2022-12-15 18:56:21] <%KoryT> This is my only wlpe that I didn't naturally have like double endurance from strength peepoSad
[2022-12-15 18:56:24] <+Irregularmatt> carry gas, car batteries around the map, do laps :)
[2022-12-15 18:56:35] <+RLF3911> As soon as you enter the raid(heavy), completing a full sprint until exhaustion gives you a big boost to strength.
[2022-12-15 18:56:42] <$warezdog> endurance is super important for people like me that suck at PvP in order to run away!
[2022-12-15 18:56:53] <@%IGotBurgerz> I have a theory that they are adding "skill depreciation" which is why the hideout is being added, to maintain skills
[2022-12-15 18:57:28] <misu_93ttv> and what's with Interchange? i heard it's almost empty, is it true?
[2022-12-15 18:57:45] <%narsilbladee> if you go in with only sniper. you will have a bonus in the start of each raid. if you are heavy. you will get faster strength. if you go light weight. you will get endurence faster
[2022-12-15 18:57:54] <+RLF3911> @misu_93ttv it's the end of the w**e, most maps are nearly empty.
[2022-12-15 18:57:56] <Xsizematter> If they dont do BIG chnages to skills after all this time that'd be embarrassing
[2022-12-15 18:58:07] <%narsilbladee> if you go for the endurence. run out your stamina bar
