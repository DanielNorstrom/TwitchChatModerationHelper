[2022-12-12 06:39:29] <Kushiel_Fotia> the one read is the one.. the murderer of the fire keeper
[2022-12-12 06:39:30] <%$KirinTheEmpress> Its just called NPC
[2022-12-12 06:39:35] <spriggan_one> there are a couple of games like that
[2022-12-12 06:39:35] <OctoMuffin> True
[2022-12-12 06:39:37] <TheGreatZalgo> So essentially, you can't light that fire at all until you deal with the murderer.

[2022-12-12 06:42:51] <TheGreatZalgo> They killed the original PC port and yeah... it was terrible
[2022-12-12 06:42:56] <%$KirinTheEmpress> The original Dark Souls game was not the best in certain areas for fps, but remasterd addressed all those issues
[2022-12-12 06:42:57] <%the_ol_regular> Oh puh-lease, I’ve had my PS3 for 1 year and I love it
[2022-12-12 06:42:57] <TheGreatZalgo> Like you NEEDED a mod to make it playable

[2022-12-12 06:43:15] <awkward_emma> @kdlutz  yeah at  times it would drop very low fps and made me have a bit of a headache

[2022-12-12 06:45:46] <TheGreatZalgo> @BirdieBoba I should mention that sometime you should try to figure out how to get to the DLC content in this game. This game has an aggressively obtuse method to reach and I'm not too sure but I think it is missable.
[2022-12-12 06:45:46] <Kushiel_Fotia> its sunny C

[2022-12-12 06:47:02] <%the_ol_regular> As a matter of fact, did you buy the PS4 remaster or the PS5 remake of Last of Us?
[2022-12-12 06:47:07] <%the_ol_regular> @kirintheempress
[2022-12-12 06:47:10] <%Argologia> Why the little interest in TLOU?
[2022-12-12 06:47:10] <%the_ol_regular> Forgot to tag
[2022-12-12 06:47:16] <TheGreatZalgo> @BirdieBoba Well the thing is, DLC content tends to complete certain story arcs left unanswered in base. Not to mention it's missable so if you miss it you kinda have to restart this game. Future Dark Souls games aren't as missable.
[2022-12-12 06:47:22] <%$KirinTheEmpress> I need to keep an eye out for the next Dark Souls stream because this is one of my favorite areas in Dark Souls 1

[2022-12-12 06:49:14] <@%kdlutz> i remember when TLOU came out on ps3, and comparing that to when uncharted 1 came out on the ps3.... i thought graphics could never get more realistic

[2022-12-12 07:01:57] <%the_ol_regular> If you want more PlayStation Exclusive titles, try giving the Uncharted series a shot @kirintheempress
[2022-12-12 07:02:08] <@%kdlutz> i loved the uncharted games
[2022-12-12 07:02:14] <@%kdlutz> 1 and 2 mostly, but they're all good
[2022-12-12 07:02:16] <%the_ol_regular> Same here
[2022-12-12 07:02:39] <%the_ol_regular> 4 was the best for me, but each one of them kept getting better after the previous one

[2022-12-12 07:03:10] <@%kdlutz> maybe its the nostalgia factor for me but i think my favourites go 2, 1, 3, 4

[2022-12-12 08:09:43] <%FriggaLovesYou> that's how I started kd
[2022-12-12 08:09:48] <Hellspawn_Godfather> I can stack pallets, unload a truck, pick items off shelves for online pickup orders, grab stuff from the backroom if someone's looking for it, grab the stuff off the backroom shelves to put it on pallets to be taken out, EVEN TAKE THE STUFF TO THE FLOOR, but as soon as I have to stock the shelves, I'm DONE.
[2022-12-12 08:10:01] <%reivehnfliyt> any you can always start with a PNGtuber
[2022-12-12 08:10:16] <%FriggaLovesYou> that's how I'm still going actually. just waiting for my new png before i come back
[2022-12-12 08:10:17] <%SpooksyVT> yeah start with png, free models, public assets, or make your own. see if its something you want to keep doing

[2022-12-12 08:10:42] <Hellspawn_Godfather> People don't stock shelves right and then I have to come behind them and redo their work and it takes forever to do it RIGHT because it's been done WRONG. Put me on literally ANYTHING ELSE 😅

[2022-12-12 08:15:21] <%mdkubit> But because of what happened, I will NEVER work at fast food ever again.

[2022-12-12 08:16:58] <Hellspawn_Godfather> Oh yeah management change here really fucked us over too because the new manager got power and it immediately went straight to his head. He decided he was correct regardless of anyone else's opinion/knowledge of more efficient methods.

[2022-12-12 08:19:03] <%mdkubit> Because new managers come out of business school, and not from the existing employees working their way up.

[2022-12-12 08:19:34] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/
[2022-12-12 08:19:43] <%mdkubit> Don't worry Birdie. We're all eager to chat with you. ^_^
[2022-12-12 08:19:47] <%KoveeTheClown> Listening to you is amazing for my mental health. I live alone, with nobody near me anywhere. And your content is beautiful, and it makes me feel like I'm not alone. That is irreplaceable. Thank you so much.

[2022-12-12 08:37:12] <%mdkubit> Ok. So... in Southern Michigan, we do NOT get Earthquakes. We just don't. .... until we did. I thought a huge semi was rolling through the neighborhood from all the rattling... but it wasn't.

[2022-12-12 08:39:39] <%mdkubit> Chicago uses Siren Head Sirens for their Tornado Warning. And it is the CREEPIEST SOUND in the world, especially when it's from multiple areas and echoes around. O_O
