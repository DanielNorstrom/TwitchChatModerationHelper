[2023-01-07 18:19:19] <%+PowoH> yeah look at the crystal group
[2023-01-07 18:19:20] <!NotSaiku> RBF viper is in RBF grouping now
[2023-01-07 18:20:13] <!NotSaiku> theres RBF 1 and RBF 2 so you can do 4x rbf crystals AND still use red spirits cause theyre in a separate "spirit" group
[2023-01-07 18:20:54] <!NotSaiku> red spirit crystal is 5 ap and 3 hd and 100hp
