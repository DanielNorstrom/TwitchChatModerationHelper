[2022-12-16 11:51:15] <@%^StreamElements>* I am a 45 year old lumberjack residing in the woods, chopping trees while living a humble and honest life. Unfortunately, this life is not sustainable anymore.. I decided to look for a job in the city and found out COVID is a thing. This can't be it.. that's impossible! I'm scared, terrified and unemployed. I resort to a life on the internet as a VTuber.. with a voice changer. Yes, it is fake. My entire life is a lie just like Chi.

[2022-12-16 12:14:41] <%BowlingBobby> iirc it's not fixed in the that sense, they treated the lessons like sidequests that you might want or not want to do
[2022-12-16 12:15:07] <!%SateLight_ed> i really recommend hades if you want to try roguelites
[2022-12-16 12:15:12] <%$kernymi> also some roguelike/roguelites is permadeath, but the the world is persistent in a way

[2022-12-16 17:18:47] <%BowlingBobby> @gama41 Actually true. You can finish the entire Marineford Arc in a couple of arcs as opposed to watching all the episodes dedicated to it

[2022-12-16 17:20:09] <%BowlingBobby> It's because you're a streamer, yeah. Most of us we can do this shit while also watching you, you can't really do the same on the hours that you stream.

Unfortunately, this life is not sustainable anymore.. I decided to look for a job in the city and found out COVID is a thing. This can't be it.. that's impossible! I'm scared, terrified and unemployed. I resort to a life on the internet as a VTuber.. with a voice changer. Yes, it is fake. My entire life is a lie just like Chi.

[2022-12-16 20:28:25] <%+altiex> if you make the tree in p8s and come back to p7s you have a buff that lets you see the mechanics before it happens
[2022-12-16 20:28:29] <%Pillowyzeal> it makes me fall asleep
[2022-12-16 20:28:32] <!%SateLight_ed> P7 is much more confusing
[2022-12-16 20:28:33] <%Keld__> P6S is my fav this tier
[2022-12-16 20:28:38] <%Pillowyzeal> Prog was ok
[2022-12-16 20:28:46] <%Pillowyzeal> Just waiting 7 min for something to happen was a bit tedious
[2022-12-16 20:28:46] <!%SateLight_ed> because on P7S you don't get the back row bough of atis
[2022-12-16 20:28:51] <%valfayr> but coco´s fall was better ^^ " you can make it you can make it ! ..... oh..... "
[2022-12-16 20:29:12] <!%SateLight_ed> so whenever i see bough of atis i always stand on the back

[2022-12-16 20:51:38] <%Rebuutv> hyped for new ult
[2022-12-16 20:51:44] <%Keld__> I think deep dungeon will revive my endgame fun
[2022-12-16 20:51:47] <%AngunTV> tenzen PauseBusiness
[2022-12-16 20:51:50] <%Keld__> POTD Solo is kinda fun
[2022-12-16 20:51:55] <%Pillowyzeal> I am burnt out XD, if you still look forward to it then you are still enjoying it
[2022-12-16 20:52:05] <%valfayr> which is a good decission
[2022-12-16 20:52:05] <%Pillowyzeal> @Keld__ Yeah I can recommend it
[2022-12-16 20:52:13] <%Pillowyzeal> DD Solo has been my replacement
[2022-12-16 20:52:35] <%Pillowyzeal> Not really enjoying redoing POTD cuz it just takes to long with a fulltime job
[2022-12-16 20:52:46] <Kain5707> i just dont understand why they cant just take all the current dungeons and make a extreme or savage variant
[2022-12-16 20:52:48] <%valfayr> maybe next time stal
[2022-12-16 20:52:48] <%Pillowyzeal> But HOH has been sooo much fun for me the past year
[2022-12-16 20:53:00] <Kain5707> criterion just sucks
[2022-12-16 20:53:14] <%Keld__> Pillowyzeal is HoH considered harder to do?
[2022-12-16 20:53:19] VIEWERS: 334
[2022-12-16 20:53:28] <%Keld__> feel like I need a better ramp into POTD solo cause ngl im dying at lvl 40
[2022-12-16 20:53:34] <%Keld__> floor 40*
[2022-12-16 20:53:37] <Kain5707> it lasted less than a week OMEGALUL
[2022-12-16 20:53:39] <%valfayr> @Kain5707 becouse that gets boring rly quick
[2022-12-16 20:53:41] <%+Histydesu> ty for helping stalll
[2022-12-16 20:53:52] <%Pillowyzeal> @Keld__ Nah, POTD is a bit more RNG depended. It is mostly harder because it just takes really long to do
[2022-12-16 20:54:12] <%Pillowyzeal> HOH can be cleared consistently on tanks if you know what you're doing
[2022-12-16 20:54:13] <%+Histydesu> that was not fun
[2022-12-16 20:54:15] <%+Histydesu> panik
[2022-12-16 20:54:21] <%Pillowyzeal> I recommend it over POTD as your first Solo DD
[2022-12-16 20:54:23] <%valfayr> @Histydesu stalalaLMAO
[2022-12-16 20:54:36] <%Pillowyzeal> IT goes faster and your experience will take over to POTD
[2022-12-16 20:54:47] <%Pillowyzeal> So you can clear that one faster as well
[2022-12-16 20:54:51] <!%SateLight_ed> question stal. which one would you prefer, EW Trial 4 EX or current raid tier?
[2022-12-16 20:55:16] <%valfayr> @Histydesu that is the fun ^^ to not know what the fuck is going on ^^
[2022-12-16 20:55:24] VIEWERS: 305
[2022-12-16 20:55:34] <Kain5707> im not saying drag out 1 thing it becomes boring like current savage
[2022-12-16 20:55:58] <!%SateLight_ed> no i mean mechanic-base
[2022-12-16 20:55:58] <Kain5707> but giving more options to do content would be nice like savage/extreme dungeons you know
[2022-12-16 20:56:01] <%+Histydesu> @Histydesu ty so much for helpin!!
[2022-12-16 20:56:24] <Kain5707> like mythic+
[2022-12-16 20:56:29] <%valfayr> kain want it like wow
[2022-12-16 20:56:48] <%Keld__> The lack of mythic + like dungeons is why i bbank my hopes on deep dungeon
[2022-12-16 20:56:54] <Kain5707> nah i hate wow
[2022-12-16 20:56:55] <%valfayr> so you run the same dungeons etc aaaaaaallllllllllllllllll the time......... just different difficulty, ist so boring
[2022-12-16 20:56:56] <%Keld__> Especiallyl cause i can play that with my casual friend
[2022-12-16 20:57:09] <Kain5707> i just would like more unique dungeon stuff
[2022-12-16 20:57:10] <%Keld__> Cause i thought I could play variant with him but he wouldnt have the gear or determination for it
[2022-12-16 20:57:24] VIEWERS: 305
[2022-12-16 20:57:24] <%Rebuutv> just do ultimates 24/7 get bourned out and still continue  Aware
[2022-12-16 20:57:41] <%Keld__> Doesnt even need to be hard dungeons just needs to be hard 4 man content to me
[2022-12-16 20:57:50] <%Keld__> but at the extreme level
[2022-12-16 20:58:05] <%Keld__> and if savage then some way for casuals to get into it
[2022-12-16 20:58:13] <%OpposeArt> stalalaBLANKIES
[2022-12-16 20:58:14] <%Keld__> cause thats where variant falls apart for me
[2022-12-16 20:58:18] <Kain5707> unreal savage
[2022-12-16 20:58:29] <%bhelldark> stalalaBLANKIES stalalaTail
[2022-12-16 20:58:56] <%Keld__> I only have 3 friends would be nice to be able to do content with all of them
[2022-12-16 20:58:57] <%valfayr> i think criterion will become the "new" thing, they will ad way more ofer the time
[2022-12-16 20:59:14] <%Rebuutv> I have been doing ultimates since last year november and savage just reclears
[2022-12-16 20:59:24] VIEWERS: 305
[2022-12-16 20:59:32] <%valfayr> yea, they just tested it, and all love it, so they will ad more
[2022-12-16 20:59:39] <%Keld__> It also sucks cause one friend is an achivement hunting type of person and FF has nothing but annyoing grind achivements
[2022-12-16 20:59:46] <%Keld__> so it turns him off from it
[2022-12-16 20:59:49] <%Rebuutv> I mean I dont do static pf is more chill for me atleast
[2022-12-16 21:00:08] <Kain5707> yea i just want more hard 4 man content i guess
[2022-12-16 21:00:22] <%valfayr> what do you need for blue ?
