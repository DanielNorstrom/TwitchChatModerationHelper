[2022-12-11 12:04:10] <%billcfc> the ref was absolutely fucking terrible
[2022-12-11 12:04:13] <%+luke_freetzone> Im happy it was Kane and not a youngster who missed the pen. Kane can probably handle it.
[2022-12-11 12:04:15] <%+bigguyc123> Goodnight bates have a great stream!
[2022-12-11 12:04:16] <%+EMMET93> The pressure on a penatly in that stage is immense and to go through it twice

[2022-12-11 12:04:18] <XxFusionFreek> i think if ur blaming kane for missing the pen ur not a footy fan

[2022-12-11 12:09:33] <@%GasPeter90> England gave Greizmann to much room and time on the ball
[2022-12-11 12:09:37] <%TheAp0> that 2nd pen will haunt Kane for a while i reckon
