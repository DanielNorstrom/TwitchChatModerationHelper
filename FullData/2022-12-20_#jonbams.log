[2022-12-20 16:43:39] <%$Bufy_99> This fear of the unknown would seem to play into two other popular theories for the number’s unlucky connotation, both of which revolve around the appearance of a 13th guest at two ancient events: In the Bible, Judas Iscariot, the 13th guest to arrive at the Last Supper, is the person who betrays Jesus. Meanwhile ancient Norse lore holds that evil and turmoil were first introduced in the world by the appearance of the treacherous and mischievous god Loki at a dinner party in Valhalla.

[2022-12-20 19:27:49] <rpgtheurge> Cheer200 The difference between a rocket and a missile is that a rocket is self-propelled, often by using flammable material stored within. However, it can have any purpose. A missile is something fired at an object for a specific purpose-destruction. However, it can be propelled by anything.
