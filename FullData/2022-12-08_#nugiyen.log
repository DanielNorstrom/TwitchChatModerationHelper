[2022-12-08 10:53:43] <+BakinPacman> one work around is skitterbots into a curse

[2022-12-08 10:56:19] <@%XaiTV> @QuackSage so not really a double tap
[2022-12-08 10:56:21] <Vosy1984> and you can pre-cast it
[2022-12-08 10:56:26] <+r0und4b0ut> finally I dont have to live with the fact that putting helix instead of my intended skill into the PoB I get double the damage

[2022-12-08 12:14:48] <+NainK> @nugiyen with 3 cluster + mastery you should easily go up to 100% poison on spell. I never build poison for my BF/BB building almost the same

[2022-12-08 12:15:17] <@%XaiTV> it's also mastery access to be fair

[2022-12-08 12:15:37] <+natespud> I am liking this build and your thinking.  I have been considering bv too but there are so many choices!
[2022-12-08 12:15:47] <+NainK> @BunnyCompany TC on bosses ? poison build, ailments builds, less boss action speed.... You a damn freak man Ôo
[2022-12-08 12:15:48] <ejaystar> @XaiTV could you fit in 2 blashpemys with the new nodes? is that even worth?
[2022-12-08 12:16:07] <+lovelesswastaken> Hello guys :) i have started poison bv last league but i was lacking on boss dps :/
[2022-12-08 12:16:17] <@%XaiTV> @ejaystar the new nodes are worse than the old curse mastery unless you travel all the way to left of scion
[2022-12-08 12:16:18] <shadvet> i'd ditch Entropy

[2022-12-08 12:17:20] <+NainK> @lovelesswastaken you'll do better this league. But maybe you didn't have enough cast speed. Poison build are all about poison duration and cast speed so you can bring up to 40 poison at the same time on a single target.
[2022-12-08 12:17:35] <+Czwarty> you guys think death's oath is gonna be alright this league? always wanted to try it
[2022-12-08 12:17:41] <@%XaiTV> or stun avoid it

[2022-12-08 12:18:02] <+natespud> deaths oath is fun for mapping and now with vaal CA it should be better at bossing too
[2022-12-08 12:18:05] <reactive_power> @nugiyen do you have any thoughts on order of operations for hex bloom + profane bloom? will it spread pops?

[2022-12-08 12:18:27] <+Czwarty> @natespud good to know, thanks
[2022-12-08 12:18:31] <+NainK> @BunnyCompany about everything this curse do and that combine very well with offenses/defenses. Actually a nerfed TC with 100% curse effectiveness on bosses is better than the freeze wee used to build in most elem build.
[2022-12-08 12:18:43] <+natespud> death oath is like chaos RF
[2022-12-08 12:18:45] <+undecan> death oath is ok but explosions are much better, last time I've check DO you do like 100-200k dmg with the arua

[2022-12-08 12:19:18] <@%XaiTV> can't forget unleash
[2022-12-08 12:19:34] <+NainK> @lovelesswastaken just only the new curse thing will allow you TC to build a lot more damage since it'll help you maintain higher poison stack and higher wither stack on bosses. You'll have a lot more room to play with.
[2022-12-08 12:19:59] <@%XaiTV> you have 3 curses right? But I guess your final curse would be enfeeble?
[2022-12-08 12:20:15] <@%XaiTV> I used punishment but that was last patch where enfeeble was trash

[2022-12-08 12:25:13] <@%XaiTV> if it's reduced you could consider that
[2022-12-08 12:25:18] <+NainK> @Czwarty 1 or 2m dps. 500K is a lil weak for T10+ correct clear spead and starting to boss.

[2022-12-08 12:26:51] <+NainK> @lovelesswastaken For the clear i can't really say because the explosion thing from Occu is very PoG but the moovespeed from Assassin is nice too. I think it's all about what you prefer. Running faster or making things go boom boom.

[2022-12-08 12:31:01] <Bashtardis> oh it is patched: "The increased Effect of your Curses Veiled modifier on Shields now has values of 8-10% (previously 12-14%). Crafted versions of this modifier have been adjusted accordingly."

[2022-12-08 12:32:12] <@%XaiTV> add impicit
[2022-12-08 12:32:14] <%arnastia> At ~88% curse effect on temp chains you get... 4x damage I think?
[2022-12-08 12:32:21] <+Nicdaric> looking at those numbers is it ever worth it going for the +2 Curse Gem Level cluster for an additional 10% curse effect?
[2022-12-08 12:32:29] <Bashtardis> those are nerfed though

[2022-12-08 12:34:35] <%arnastia> @Shaderex Yeah, poison applies a fixed damage per second based on the hit that applied it, so increased poison stack duration = increased total damage

[2022-12-08 12:41:16] <+BakinPacman> im gonna try my meme bodyswap build. can hit the burning damage 36m threshold without cast on death. abusing cast on death it goes to 142m KEKW
[2022-12-08 12:41:18] <Prokka> the account bound items from the league mechanic sound and look potentially game changing
[2022-12-08 12:41:19] <M0nne> Hey man what do you think about double lead sprinkler str stacking chieftain?
[2022-12-08 12:41:26] <firelite91> can blade vortex cause bleeding?
[2022-12-08 12:41:29] <angustin> temp chain on hit glove corruption?
[2022-12-08 12:41:30] <SollSmottoh> Atlas looking good, is there any place we can look at it ?
[2022-12-08 12:41:34] <Xenonic_Gaming> @undecan i made a CA pathfinder and it looks great in every aspect... except i cant get it to deal dps FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-08 12:41:36] <coolfoolboo> i will never play ea ballista again.. i fcking hate the delay dmg

[2022-12-08 12:41:56] <+CaldoDeLuca> Is the new gem changes announcement the entirety of the changes or will patchnotes bring other balances to other gems_
[2022-12-08 12:42:05] <FSRoosta> How much of the new Temp Chains is paper damage? - it just makes the poisons last super long.
[2022-12-08 12:42:06] <DCzech> @SollSmottoh No, GGG said it will be up maybe like 2 hours before league start
[2022-12-08 12:42:12] <garbaroki> Nugi are you ready to jump?

[2022-12-08 12:42:24] <reactive_power> @nugiyen clearly poison is insane with temp chains, but have you looked at blight? you can max out 20 stacks so easily now
[2022-12-08 12:42:28] <+CaldoDeLuca> Oh i see, thanks Xai
[2022-12-08 12:42:28] <Xenonic_Gaming> @CaldoDeLuca full patch notes were released a week ago

[2022-12-08 12:43:14] <ResurrectionByElection> mark of submission is also a delve unique, like obliteration Delvege
[2022-12-08 12:43:14] <+undecan> you could combine ca arrow nova and ballista toxic rain
[2022-12-08 12:43:16] <DarkKwiskas> yup that sounds interesting :)

[2022-12-08 12:43:24] <+lazorlarz> @Kroohpyyh it's melee so people will think you're a GIGACHAD
[2022-12-08 12:43:24] <+Masamuneee> soul rend duration with stacked temp chains
[2022-12-08 12:43:24] <@%XaiTV> set it on Blight maybe?
[2022-12-08 12:43:26] <w4k1i> Yeah Vall Blight is pretty lit
[2022-12-08 12:43:28] <reactive_power> select blight
[2022-12-08 12:43:28] <afterwaga> Any1 have a hcssf viable ED build for this league?
[2022-12-08 12:43:35] <@%XaiTV> or just do Blight damage x2
[2022-12-08 12:43:37] <@%XaiTV> that's accurate I think
[2022-12-08 12:43:39] <A_Badalhoca> it counts 3 blight stacks by default i think
[2022-12-08 12:43:42] <+arboreus> Vaal blight really benefitted from the jewels though
[2022-12-08 12:43:48] <A_Badalhoca> 3
[2022-12-08 12:43:56] <LeatheryFarts> 3 stacks
[2022-12-08 12:43:56] <%Amanel123> @kroohpyyh Played so much casting shit playing melee now is an upside for me
[2022-12-08 12:44:00] <@%XaiTV> oh ok
[2022-12-08 12:44:04] <@%XaiTV> I thought it was 20 LOLW
[2022-12-08 12:44:08] <reactive_power> I mean regular blight is 100k with no links
[2022-12-08 12:44:09] <+dinmolair> Are you going to play this build instead of Pconc now?
[2022-12-08 12:44:09] <overwpowered> Vaal Blight like in Incursion league
[2022-12-08 12:44:14] <Kroohpyyh> 3
[2022-12-08 12:44:23] <+BakinPacman> hmmm
[2022-12-08 12:44:24] <+CMF1972> Apply curses with bane maybe?
[2022-12-08 12:44:30] <Kroohpyyh> it repeats twice
[2022-12-08 12:44:35] <Kroohpyyh> Echo shrine makes it go bonkers
[2022-12-08 12:44:46] <LeatheryFarts> 6 sec duration. 7sec soul gain prevention so no

[2022-12-08 12:45:07] <+CaldoDeLuca> How does soulrend looks this league?
[2022-12-08 12:45:09] <Coolingmoon> and double base damage

[2022-12-08 12:45:43] <reactive_power> 6s is damage
[2022-12-08 12:45:45] <Kroohpyyh> You might be able to get 2nd cast off

[2022-12-08 12:45:48] <+seinanfx> is poison bv good for boss killing?
[2022-12-08 12:45:52] <+undecan> @caldodeluca low single target slow cast time doable but much better options
[2022-12-08 12:46:12] <tschundekaer> Isnt it like impossible to boss on poison BV nowadays ?
[2022-12-08 12:46:17] <@%XaiTV> let's say 3 casts per duration
[2022-12-08 12:46:27] <@%XaiTV> to account for moving around and stuff
[2022-12-08 12:46:32] <fiveonefiveoh> why can i already see vaal BF tank meme's happening in the near future.
[2022-12-08 12:46:34] <@%XaiTV> I'd go with 9 layers
[2022-12-08 12:46:36] <agriguy> how did they change blight/vaal blight?
[2022-12-08 12:46:43] <+CaldoDeLuca> @undecan Kinda wanted to play it but ugh. Looking for a more all-rounder
[2022-12-08 12:46:47] <Trluciferangel> @CaldoDeLuca paak hc is going to use soulrend as clear with hexblast as single target. so my guess its nice
[2022-12-08 12:47:08] <van_tonder> it's ok

[2022-12-08 13:10:48] <+undecan> couldn't they treat some spell cast times like they do with travel skills? would make something like soul rend or exsanguinate so much nicer
[2022-12-08 13:10:49] <Kroohpyyh> @RiIvenar Your hit is already large enough for esimated armor, you'd need to set them to have flat %dr
[2022-12-08 13:10:53] <KKRT_> yes, normal caustic arrow was great and vaal is like free lvl 27 caustic arrow that you can pop twice and lasts 4x times longer than normal caustic arrow

[2022-12-08 13:50:55] <BalderSideSwag> @illoomenated atm i think it will never consume the ground curse if you have another curse , because it always uses the curse with the shortest duration and the ground curse has no duration infinite.  Could ofc be that the game thinks no duration = 0 duration , and thus it always uses the ground curse, but no way to know until we try it.
[2022-12-08 13:51:00] <+NainK> @Shadu95 ooooooooooh nice question. Actually the moment i saw "can't repeat" i juste drop the skill on the side of the road
