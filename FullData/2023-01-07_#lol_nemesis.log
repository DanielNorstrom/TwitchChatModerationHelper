[2023-01-07 19:31:17] <+fp_jesta> @lol_nemesis Dear nemesis, this is Qiyana's father. I am writing to you in efforts to find out how you are going to replace my son's keyboard (which he got for Christmas) after he broke it while playing with you. I think it's disgusting that you are happy to see my 27 year old baby boy in tears just so you can increase your popularity on Twitchtube. You have 3 days to respond before I let Twitter decide. Thanks, Gregory.

[2023-01-07 20:52:56] <%+RussBear_lol> @Fuyukori Doesn't matter tbh, I just think it has too much damage, you can't oneshot him out of stealth due to crown and too much pressure on all lanes due to invisibility
[2023-01-07 20:52:58] <phreg_> should have to bind spell theifs like kalista

[2023-01-07 21:08:38] <@^Nightbot> wait people are still here? lol thats really weird. i was just gunna click on a vod to watch cuz a friend recommended it and saw you guys still sitting here when the streamer isnt even live. Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of being friends with a streamer, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic. later Libido
