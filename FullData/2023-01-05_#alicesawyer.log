[2023-01-05 00:00:02] <%ARivalAppears> @supersanttu7 Look I'm here for art. I will not reduce my scope because they have fur
[2023-01-05 00:00:03] <%supersanttu7> @supersanttu7 I mean stuff like CHANGED
[2023-01-05 00:00:19] [Announcement] <Nightbot> If you're enjoying the stream, hit the follow button! You can also follow Alice on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chainsaw_alice alices18Wiggly
[2023-01-05 00:00:20] <cockablaze> why do you read twitter
[2023-01-05 00:00:22] <%Hirudolor> I love reading stupid shit on twitter and getting mad, its my favourite activity
[2023-01-05 00:00:25] <%supersanttu7> solution: do not be on twitter, works for me!
[2023-01-05 00:00:25] <%ClosoTezuka> children under 18 shouldnt be allowed on the internet that's my hot take
[2023-01-05 00:00:26] <%$Jahuak> Just don't use twitter alices18Girlboss
[2023-01-05 00:00:28] <%hectop4scal> the comments section is indeed full of bad opinions
[2023-01-05 00:00:29] <MURPHAGATOR> but if you dont talk about stuff you don't know about how are you supposed to prove how you are the smartest at everything to stroke your own ego?
[2023-01-05 00:00:32] <BearEatSalmon> cutting twitter out of my life was the best shit i did last year
[2023-01-05 00:00:34] <gfaertgaertgqet> i remember seeing ppl say stuff like "loli literally means child in japanese"
[2023-01-05 00:00:40] <gfaertgaertgqet> like literally how
[2023-01-05 00:00:48] <LordXal> Twitter & FB needs to be wiped
[2023-01-05 00:00:57] <sir_isaias> people faking their dm's lol
[2023-01-05 00:00:58] <%sketchyjuli> dont be on Twitter imo
[2023-01-05 00:01:04] <%sketchyjuli> Like i am
[2023-01-05 00:01:06] <%bitelemons> i just follow less english speakers lol
[2023-01-05 00:01:06] <%sketchyjuli> it sucks
[2023-01-05 00:01:12] <%supersanttu7> @LordXal noooo not FB I don't want the ant roleplay getting deleted
[2023-01-05 00:01:26] <Eluvianii> O only follow artists and streamers to avoid that. Not that twitter cares, it still puts stupid things I don't care about in my feed
[2023-01-05 00:01:26] <%hectop4scal> I used to hang in circles that did a lot of sex discourse and it was. tiring.
[2023-01-05 00:01:32] <%ClosoTezuka> @gfaertgaertgqet the fact that lolicon translates to pedophile but shotacon translates to shotacon on google translate is the funniest meme
[2023-01-05 00:01:33] VIEWERS: 287
[2023-01-05 00:01:49] <@%achievementguy> the trick is to only follow the funny dancing animal accounts.... or so I thought before even they started having drama wars
[2023-01-05 00:02:04] <%ARivalAppears> Yeah not even the animal accounts are safe actually lol
[2023-01-05 00:02:12] <AmBjoorn> @gfaertgaertgqet it does?

[2023-01-05 00:02:26] <BearEatSalmon> "freaks dni" excludes the entire human race
[2023-01-05 00:02:40] <%+Vermuth> just follow 5k people like me and you only see art and discourse melts together and turns the timeline into the equivalent of the anime censored bad food
[2023-01-05 00:03:06] <gorillafinn> based
[2023-01-05 00:03:09] <cockablaze> The only way to ethically interact with Twitter is only following the official Teletubbies account and consequently never logging on because the only thing on your timeline is fucking teletubbies shit
[2023-01-05 00:03:12] <%hectop4scal> fish people from beyond the depths DO NOT interact
[2023-01-05 00:03:12] <%supersanttu7> remember when Yahoo banned horny stuff on Tumblr and made the platform lose 90% of its commercial value KEKW
[2023-01-05 00:03:13] <BearEatSalmon> i only interact with freaks
[2023-01-05 00:03:14] <%Majkatt> I just have a folder of bookmarks for specific twitter accounts on my browser

[2023-01-05 00:03:57] <%ffwired> Twitter accounts work with RSS reasers fyi
[2023-01-05 00:04:01] <honktowndeluxe> I think I read it was sold for $14 million, less than an empty lot in California

[2023-01-05 00:04:41] <%ClosoTezuka> its latin for hell or something
[2023-01-05 00:04:41] <%supersanttu7> modern tumblr is that weird post-disaster ecosystem

[2023-01-05 00:10:01] <%$thepsgmr> You played persona 5?
[2023-01-05 00:10:10] <!%Yurichanchannel> P4s alright but they kept trying to pair kanji with naoto and I was dating naoto
[2023-01-05 00:10:18] <%hectop4scal> p4u is the fighting game
[2023-01-05 00:10:22] <%ClosoTezuka> you dont like NTR?
[2023-01-05 00:10:23] <@%bhdthedj> the persona games are ok but smt better

[2023-01-05 00:10:53] <%+Vermuth> ntr rules
[2023-01-05 00:10:54] <%AkiajiMargo> digital devil saga is the best game ever also written by a woman
[2023-01-05 00:11:00] <cockablaze> when you play a persona game you get the incontrollable urge to make a 10 hour video essay on it
[2023-01-05 00:11:10] <%ClosoTezuka> its true!!!
[2023-01-05 00:11:13] <liquid_koe> I like things that are fun
[2023-01-05 00:11:18] <%$Jahuak> Oh no it's NTR discussion time

[2023-01-05 00:11:37] <%$thepsgmr> @jahuak I hope it’s not💀
[2023-01-05 00:11:37] <Tubacabra_> Gamer's greetings
[2023-01-05 00:11:40] <gorillafinn> i laugh when i see NTR trigger warnings
[2023-01-05 00:11:41] <Eluvianii> It's Persona but edgier. Or rather Persona is SMT but cheerier
[2023-01-05 00:11:43] <LordXal> no it's Fortnite 3 music
[2023-01-05 00:11:44] <%Fridge_Draws> This is the "i hate my friends' music
[2023-01-05 00:11:44] <gorillafinn> like who is so soft
[2023-01-05 00:11:47] <BearEatSalmon> digital devil saga introduces the concept of "what if you had teeth for titties"
[2023-01-05 00:11:52] <%ClosoTezuka> my friend keeps beating the shit out of me to get me to play smt 3 but i wont do it
[2023-01-05 00:11:54] <!%Yurichanchannel> adult game forums go INSANE when NTR is brought up and it's incredibly funny
[2023-01-05 00:11:58] <%Paint2D> I don't understand the NTR hate
[2023-01-05 00:12:00] <liquid_koe> NTR doesn't make me mad. But then again, the job that I do...
[2023-01-05 00:12:02] <%supersanttu7> fun anime history fact: the first popular yandere was in JoJo part 4 as a parody of obsessive shoujo characters
[2023-01-05 00:12:06] <AmBjoorn> This background music is a track from one of the earlier Mario Party games I think
[2023-01-05 00:12:09] <%clovooo> I don't know if persona is THAT cheery, I mean looking at the final stuff in all the games
[2023-01-05 00:12:19] <%Majkatt> I played persona once, I went into a dungeon and some object decided to cast an instakill spell on my mc and I game overed
[2023-01-05 00:12:21] <%clovooo> But it's definitely different from smts apocalyptic scenarios
[2023-01-05 00:12:21] <%$thepsgmr> I played doki doki earlier this month. Man it caught me off guard with its glitches 💀 and I got 100% on it
[2023-01-05 00:12:30] <%hectop4scal> they're too long and have questionable, broad themes and characters that are squarely Good or squarely Bad or squarely Bad Until They Are Good
[2023-01-05 00:12:33] <%$thepsgmr> But no question doki doki is a masterpiece
[2023-01-05 00:12:34] <%sketchyjuli> NTRman
[2023-01-05 00:12:40] <%Hirudolor> He works at the NTR factory
[2023-01-05 00:12:41] <%ARivalAppears> It's very funny being into both Netorare and Indian Cinema KEKW There's a famous actor who's initials are NTR
[2023-01-05 00:12:41] <LordXal> Manhunt is a cheery game @clovooo
[2023-01-05 00:12:46] <%supersanttu7> I dislike NTR and thus ignore its existence 👍
[2023-01-05 00:12:50] <%AkiajiMargo> doki doki majo shinpan
[2023-01-05 00:12:50] <yev_san> doki doki panic is a good game
[2023-01-05 00:12:57] <@%bhdthedj> y'all should play a good game like RE6 instead
[2023-01-05 00:13:02] <%+Vermuth> i like that before hair is added the anime creature is tentacool shaped

[2023-01-05 00:13:30] <%Majkatt> Can you play and enjoy a game of you dislike/hate the visuals?
[2023-01-05 00:13:32] <Eluvianii> Well, going deeper I'd say the difference is Persona talks about personal problems while SMT talks about humanity-wide problems

[2023-01-05 00:14:15] <BearEatSalmon> @ARivalAppears also for every other genre. its basically an entire cottage industry
[2023-01-05 00:14:16] <%ClosoTezuka> my name is inspired from ks :) love katawa shoujo
[2023-01-05 00:14:17] <cockablaze> I fixed the book genre by packaging every single novel with a packet of gamer girl barf
[2023-01-05 00:14:19] <%clovooo> I played a western VN recently that kinda played it straight called Sirens Call. it's kinda similar to Subahibi actually
[2023-01-05 00:14:24] <%AkiajiMargo> "anyone that says everything someone wants to hear just to date them is a psychopath" huh?

[2023-01-05 00:14:41] <%hectop4scal> iirc the true end of ddlc has an afterword where he talks about how much dating sims inspired him. its been a few years since I've seen it tho

[2023-01-05 00:34:51] <liquid_koe> Snoop dogg once streamed for a week with his mic muted, and chat on emotes only mode. The chat tried to communicate that fact to him in emojis
[2023-01-05 00:34:53] <%ClosoTezuka> theres literally so many streamers that do nothing

[2023-01-05 00:35:03] <@%achievementguy> I like art streams where they just say a single sentence to themselves and all you hear is their 5 song playlist on repeat
[2023-01-05 00:35:09] <%Hirudolor> I guess alot of artists do it just so they have pressure on them so they actually draw and dont slack around
[2023-01-05 00:35:09] <+IvoryState> some days drawing is just harder than others
[2023-01-05 00:35:15] <@%bhdthedj> just put that "I ain't reading all that, sorry or congratulations" tweet over the chat bar

[2023-01-05 01:10:35] <cockablaze> Streamer did you switch your system locale to japanese? It makes your art draw itself better
[2023-01-05 01:10:41] <dualedgesa> Temper yourself in the Sonic fan community. You'll come out immune to creeps and weirdos.
[2023-01-05 01:10:43] <gorillafinn> im in the weirdo part of alice fandom
[2023-01-05 01:10:47] <AutolycusLive> 7% seems like a generous figure

[2023-01-05 01:11:19] <yev_san> a fandom can ruin something. a funny joke on an episode you like, can then become an annoying overused meme

[2023-01-05 02:05:38] <%Ulu_Threk> What about a Halberd?
[2023-01-05 02:05:47] <AtonerEuphonic> swords are always cool, knifes though? Knives are bottom-tier
[2023-01-05 02:06:03] <%LisaLavitz> a halberd is a polearm with an axe head
[2023-01-05 02:06:09] <%liquid_koe> Anyone remember Jin, the NTR artist? He did the Tachibana doujin, which basically gave the genre second life. I think he might be dead.
[2023-01-05 02:06:17] <%ARivalAppears> I like NTR just for the thought that sex can feel so good as to degrade your morals. Like a drug but it's just fucking
[2023-01-05 02:06:19] VIEWERS: 150
[2023-01-05 02:06:28] <%Transient_Nova> What about a dagger? That’s basically a tiny sword-knife.
[2023-01-05 02:06:34] <%Ulu_Threk> It may look like a sword to us but that's a knife. Alice is just 1 foot tall
[2023-01-05 02:06:42] <%sketchyjuli> @ARivalAppears this, yeah
[2023-01-05 02:06:46] <%LisaLavitz> I think it depends on how mean the woman is about it.
[2023-01-05 02:06:54] <%Ulu_Threk> @arivalappears I mean there is mindbreak that does the same without cheating
[2023-01-05 02:07:23] <!%$8lives> We started the stream with vore, and ended with NTR. A stream for the history books
[2023-01-05 02:07:24] <%Ulu_Threk> Womwn do love taboo
[2023-01-05 02:07:27] <%LisaLavitz> ntr isn't always cheating though.
[2023-01-05 02:07:28] <%clovooo> Its a sin!
[2023-01-05 02:07:40] <%ARivalAppears> Yeah, but mindbreak has that point they like to go over and it just focuses on them becoming a mess and not about how their normal life is shifted
[2023-01-05 02:08:06] <%Ulu_Threk> If it's a crush that's not NTR that's just you being a loswr lmao
[2023-01-05 02:08:13] <%ARivalAppears> True
[2023-01-05 02:08:19] VIEWERS: 141
[2023-01-05 02:08:20] <%sketchyjuli> yeah, theres something about the woman getting "worse" at the end that is part of it
[2023-01-05 02:08:26] <%liquid_koe> NTR and cheating are different genres. Cheating doujins can be ones where the woman has someone, but it gets 0 focus aside from a mention that she is married or something. Educate yourselves about NTR damn it.
[2023-01-05 02:08:29] <AtonerEuphonic> the vibes of NTR and being NTR'd
[2023-01-05 02:08:51] <%Ulu_Threk> That's like saying Justin Beiber NTR'd a nation of teen age boys when he dated Selena Gomez
[2023-01-05 02:09:01] <%liquid_koe> And then there is Netori and Netorase....
[2023-01-05 02:09:17] <%TheGenieA1> did you do karaoke of the ntr song
[2023-01-05 02:09:19] <%Ulu_Threk> celebrities are fiction
[2023-01-05 02:09:23] <%ARivalAppears> Yeah I hate that Netori and Netorase get lumped into NTR
[2023-01-05 02:09:41] <LordXal> Selena Gomez is in a 3 way relationship now
[2023-01-05 02:09:53] <%LisaLavitz> is there a word for reverse ntr, when the protagonist is forced into relations with someone they don't want?
[2023-01-05 02:10:00] <%ARivalAppears> Netori is from the "Stealer" perspective
[2023-01-05 02:10:05] <%ARivalAppears> Netorase is cuckoldry
[2023-01-05 02:10:05] <%liquid_koe> Vtuber fanbases are the most NTR'd fanbase. Think about it. They all live in fear of finding out that their oshi has a boyfriend, or isn't a virgin?
[2023-01-05 02:10:19] VIEWERS: 141
[2023-01-05 02:10:26] <%Ulu_Threk> @lisalavitz I mean that's just non-con
[2023-01-05 02:10:37] <%LisaLavitz> that's so broad though
[2023-01-05 02:10:44] <LordXal> we already know Alice's bf is Jason
[2023-01-05 02:10:49] <%clovooo> Jermas GF was originally a fan actually
[2023-01-05 02:10:54] <%Ulu_Threk> I know a friend who had a crush on Jerma and was sad when she heard he got a gf
[2023-01-05 02:10:57] <%+owlbyte_> Jerma is pure and would never cheat on me
[2023-01-05 02:11:00] <!%Yurichanchannel> Wait but when i heard jerma had a GF i was a little sad
[2023-01-05 02:11:14] <@%xsolus> yc...
[2023-01-05 02:11:33] <!%Yurichanchannel> I am happy 4 jerma but i've been watching fancams for years...
[2023-01-05 02:11:35] <%liquid_koe> I remember one japanese vtuber did a stream, where her fans heard all the gory details of her back being blown out. The video is sadly no longer up.
[2023-01-05 02:11:40] <@%xsolus> the jerma fancams KEKW
[2023-01-05 02:11:53] <LordXal> I don't get how someone can date a fan...don't those usually go horrible?
[2023-01-05 02:12:07] <%LisaLavitz> wat? like in a good way?
[2023-01-05 02:12:11] <%ARivalAppears> Yeah that's the part I don't understand, but It's not my decision
[2023-01-05 02:12:19] VIEWERS: 139
[2023-01-05 02:12:21] <%+IvoryState> I can fix Jerma
[2023-01-05 02:12:30] <%ARivalAppears> Especially with Jerma fans too lol
[2023-01-05 02:12:38] <%Ulu_Threk> Jerma is the one in danger. You see that man. A sad little meow meow
[2023-01-05 02:12:57] <%Majkatt> It's similar to incest, there can be a bad power dynamic and there often is but it's not intrinsic to it
[2023-01-05 02:13:12] <%LisaLavitz> Is it harder for guys? I feel like there is a built in perception of men with celebrity power
[2023-01-05 02:13:24] <%ARivalAppears> Jerma dating a "One Guy" and gave her so much power
[2023-01-05 02:13:35] <%liquid_koe> Actually, one of my female friends has the craziest idea. She wants to become a vtuber, and then do a private party for her subs. The bigger tier you have, the more you get.
[2023-01-05 02:13:50] <%Ulu_Threk> I mean chat constantly Negs Jerma. His ego can't grow no matter what lol
[2023-01-05 02:13:52] <Tubacabra_> Didn't Tobuscus keep showing his dick at parties or something? and now hes like a flat earther or some shit
[2023-01-05 02:13:56] <%LisaLavitz> ya i don't think i would ever date a fan (assuming i was famous). better to get famous and then date your celebrity crushes
[2023-01-05 02:13:58] <soapwrecker> I love twitch and vtubers. Never know when you are gonna stumble into a deep analysis of NTR... And then go into debate of streamer/community relationships. But then it somehow always goes to Jerma....

[2023-01-05 02:15:29] <Tubacabra_> My goal is to get Bezos rich and comission massive quantities of NTR of all the characters for big memes
[2023-01-05 02:15:51] <%ARivalAppears> Caleb just watching through the window saying "I need a key"
[2023-01-05 02:15:54] <%liquid_koe> My goal is to find the holy grail and live forever.
[2023-01-05 02:16:01] <%Hirudolor> @ARivalAppears lmao
[2023-01-05 02:16:12] <soapwrecker> just get Bezos rich and make NTR mainstream at that point
[2023-01-05 02:16:18] <AtonerEuphonic> I love seeing my boys happy but at the same time I think. I can make them worse and that's hotter

[2023-01-05 02:16:47] <%+IvoryState> The original NTR art was Columbia being swindled by a german caricature during ww1
[2023-01-05 02:16:49] <@%xsolus> mario died
[2023-01-05 02:16:49] <%+owlbyte_> If you NTR'd Gabriel he'd start yelling about how it's against the 10 commandments
[2023-01-05 02:16:50] <%liquid_koe> Wake up. Open your favorite doujin site. Type in NTR. Read the dozen new doujins. Rinse and repeat.
[2023-01-05 02:16:58] <%LisaLavitz> ty that was gross
[2023-01-05 02:17:01] <%Ulu_Threk> NTR an angel? I mean that's just not Christian lmao.
[2023-01-05 02:17:09] <!%$8lives> If I hire a big staff to take care of a mansion I rarely live in.... and then hire one girl to stay in her room and play games, will the rest of the staff resent her?
[2023-01-05 02:17:22] <%Ulu_Threk> "Sorry Gabriell, I am buddhist now"
[2023-01-05 02:17:28] <%LisaLavitz> that sounds like the start of a good manga
[2023-01-05 02:17:58] <%derpaton> I'd rather just have a small cute cottage than a mansion
[2023-01-05 02:18:03] <%LisaLavitz> if you write it, i'd give it a read

[2023-01-05 02:18:34] <%Ulu_Threk> Depends on how big the mansion is, and how much work there is to do. Like 2 hours of work, that's chill
[2023-01-05 02:18:34] <%derpaton> yiss
[2023-01-05 02:18:34] <%liquid_koe> A doujin series about Rider from Fate/Stay night has been going on for so long, some people have gone from school to finishing college, and it's still going.
[2023-01-05 02:18:39] <%LisaLavitz> it's better to haunt people with tho
[2023-01-05 02:18:56] <%derpaton> the more room you have the more crap you fill it with
