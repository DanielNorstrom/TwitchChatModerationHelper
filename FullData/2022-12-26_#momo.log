[2022-12-26 06:07:01] <%dacie_mcshortie> Hillshire Farms Lil’ smokies cocktail sausages. They come in beef or pork.  You can make your own pigs in a blanket with them but cooked in barbecue sauce is the most common method.
[2022-12-26 06:07:01] <+100gecsjoker> jalapeno cheddar pig's in a blanket omg
