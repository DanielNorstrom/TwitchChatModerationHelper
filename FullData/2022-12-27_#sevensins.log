[2022-12-27 10:10:44] <%Neobullseye> @TidusZecht Wrong game :P
[2022-12-27 10:10:51] <%quovad15> still don't get why you can't die in this boss fight
[2022-12-27 10:10:53] <%Neobullseye> We already did that one.
[2022-12-27 10:11:03] <%TheCraftyDawg> I'm confused. Are we still in re-run? The title says so and the stream time is long. But it's past the time when he usually starts
[2022-12-27 10:11:19] <%Lonefellow> @TheCraftyDawg Refresh :)

[2022-12-27 10:14:46] <%BoomBaybi> i enjoyed this one. it wasn't as hard as i expected, but it was still fun to watch you both plan
[2022-12-27 10:14:48] <%Lonefellow> Time for Archer Fantasy XII
[2022-12-27 10:14:48] <%GanD988> it was really a fun way to see playing it. It's like playing any other FF. you need the right character for the right fight
[2022-12-27 10:15:00] <%Amylou14> It was fun!
[2022-12-27 10:15:07] <%$runefactor> bed time. good luck in 12.
[2022-12-27 10:15:22] <%quovad15> i thought you would have more walls.
[2022-12-27 10:15:51] <%Lonefellow> I liked it for the vast majority of the playthrough (probably my fav challenge in the Fiesta ever). I just generally dislike how much Rikku breaks challenges.
[2022-12-27 10:15:54] <%TidusZecht> Time for more Auron Theme

[2022-12-27 10:16:39] <$Xanster> FFX is as always kinda emotional. But that's what i love at FFX :D And the Playthrough was really nice. I'm happy that we still have some nice Games to come :D
[2022-12-27 10:17:04] <%quovad15> you could make that challenge. no overdrives beside forced story overdrives
[2022-12-27 10:17:41] <%Lonefellow> Like - I deeply respects BGGs knowledge of the game and the way he manouvered the race. But when he used Trio on Yunalesca it just felt.... Anticlimactic? LUL
[2022-12-27 10:17:42] <%TidusZecht> The willpower of Auron is something else if you think about it. He protected Braska until he faced Sin and died. Then, in anger, he went back to yunalesca and got thrashed. Then, through hardship and turmoil, he crawled his way to the gagazet gate and told Kimahri to go take Yuna to Besaid

[2022-12-27 10:19:36] <%quovad15> he looks like monkey
[2022-12-27 10:19:38] <%Lonefellow> Is it just the lighting or is Tidus a lot tanner in CGI cutscenes?

[2022-12-27 13:40:12] <%XyFreak> the table view is propably giving you a better overview over what exactly happened during ffx
[2022-12-27 13:40:36] <%XyFreak> and why ppl (me included) thought you lost like 2hrs over bgg when in reality you didnt
[2022-12-27 13:40:59] <%Aurien__> BGG did extra stuff that he didn't need to do
[2022-12-27 13:41:02] <%Lonefellow> If Yu Yevon didn't give you issues (due to no zombie strike) it would have been even less. So that's a great result
[2022-12-27 13:41:08] <%Aurien__> because he forgot stuff

[2022-12-27 13:44:18] <%Aurien__> the way he did it was

[2022-12-27 13:44:47] <%tcmatthews_jr> no his waking around in circles because he did not do it efficiently

[2022-12-27 13:45:49] <%CynniUniflame> BGG had a really good endgame
[2022-12-27 13:45:49] <%XyFreak> double casting 22k ultima is better LUL
[2022-12-27 13:46:12] <%Lonefellow> @XyFreak I didn't catch the end, how did he beat the tick?
[2022-12-27 13:46:13] <@%SRGDUCK> Yeah you had a couple deaths in Sin so Nirvana probably would have been deathless
[2022-12-27 13:46:23] <%XyFreak> the tick got phoenixed
[2022-12-27 13:46:51] <%Aurien__> either way you both beat my FFX time by 2:20 hours
[2022-12-27 13:46:59] <%Aurien__> yeah I was surprised by that myself
[2022-12-27 13:47:01] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, your "why is Auron in my party?" was heartbreaking LUL
[2022-12-27 13:47:02] <%Aurien__> BGG knew though
[2022-12-27 13:47:11] <@%Neobullseye> I used Magic Break on my first run.

[2022-12-27 13:47:32] <%GanD988> 184 dmg iirc
[2022-12-27 13:47:36] <%CynniUniflame> Yeah but BGG speedran this game for ages, so ofc he knows that
[2022-12-27 13:48:04] <%Aurien__> Auron was still at the very start of the sphere grid for me
[2022-12-27 13:48:56] <%Aurien__> I did generally what BGG did, but not nearly as good as he did, I wasted more spheres than he did
[2022-12-27 13:49:05] <%Aurien__> his Tidus grid looked so hilarious
[2022-12-27 13:49:25] <%Aurien__> it was a bit of tidus's sphere grid, a bit of auron, a bit of tidus at the end etc

[2022-12-27 13:49:29] <@%Neobullseye> Oh, on Yu Yevon, I mean. It reduces his heals to... 5K or something?
[2022-12-27 13:49:44] <%Lonefellow> It's a big ass grid. It takes a long time to optimize your approach to it
[2022-12-27 13:49:55] <%CynniUniflame> Yeah, you spend a lot of time in menus compared to BGG.
[2022-12-27 13:50:03] <%Aurien__> I got zombie attack on tidus, so zombie weapons weren't a problem
[2022-12-27 13:50:14] <%Lonefellow> Like, the moment I looked at the skill tree for PoE, I just closed the game and uninstalled it. LUL
[2022-12-27 13:50:31] <%CynniUniflame> you did really well.
[2022-12-27 13:50:54] <%tcmatthews_jr> BGG really broke the sphere grid this year
[2022-12-27 13:51:01] <%Aurien__> anyway, this is the last game in my fiesta play along, I've finished 13 15, and 7R
[2022-12-27 13:51:11] <%Aurien__> yes he did
[2022-12-27 13:51:25] <%Aurien__> he got flare and then used a return sphere to mop up more magic
[2022-12-27 13:51:27] VIEWERS: 554
[2022-12-27 13:51:45] <%CynniUniflame> He also had Wakka on Lulu's path
[2022-12-27 13:52:10] <%Aurien__> he also had double AP on nirvana so he got a TON of extra sphere levels through sin
[2022-12-27 13:52:38] <%Aurien__> yeah I think i'm not gonna skip that next year either lol
[2022-12-27 13:52:41] <%CynniUniflame> Hey, but now you know Seven. You can do it next year too XD

[2022-12-27 13:54:11] <%Lonefellow> I mean, the only thing preventing me from replaying X is the no cutscene skip, so this would be perfect. It's my favorite FF but I get the story through you guys every year.
[2022-12-27 13:54:29] <%Kelthanes> Ps5 or switch

[2022-12-27 13:54:41] <%Poidrac> I don't think you should feel stupid about it, just a learning experience. You have a lot to think about on the spot in the fiesta to adjust to the conditions involved
[2022-12-27 13:54:51] <%tcmatthews_jr> or another challenge you must get all ultimate weapons but you cannot use ultimate weapons
[2022-12-27 13:54:57] <%Lonefellow> @Kelthanes I think that entirely depends on if you want it to be portable or not
[2022-12-27 13:55:20] <%XyFreak> @tcmatthews_jr but that means blitzball...

[2022-12-27 13:59:31] <@%Neobullseye> Honestly. Considering how getting all Aeons gets you like 95% of the way to the Nirvana anyway, I'd argue it's one of the only Celestial Weapons worth picking up in non-completionist runs.
[2022-12-27 14:00:13] <@%Neobullseye> Everything else requires either a ton of time input, perfect play in stupid minigames, or both.

[2022-12-27 14:01:03] <+shadowking01> blitzball is not too bad once you get the right players, the OG team needed cuts
[2022-12-27 14:01:10] <%tcmatthews_jr> it was partially a joke troll suggestion because i know how painful it is to collect them but then to not be able to use them on top of them it is pure Troll run
[2022-12-27 14:01:30] VIEWERS: 544
[2022-12-27 14:02:47] <%Neobullseye> When you're going after superbosses, I'd personally suggest Rikku, Auron and Yuna.  Rikku because Mix is broken as all hell, and Auron and Yuna because trying to go after the Superbosses pretty much gets you their weapons anyway.
[2022-12-27 14:02:52] <%tcmatthews_jr> true but FF6 has surprising options when it comes to not using espers,

[2022-12-27 14:07:17] <%Neobullseye> As for Blitzball; honestly, I'd say that Attack Reels is pretty much the only thing worth grabbing, and *only* because it's the first thing on the list anyway.
[2022-12-27 14:07:26] <%zazu1019> Also Triple Triad was awesome that's the FF8 one right?

[2022-12-27 14:11:48] <%Neobullseye> Sorry if I have a slow reaction; internet is iffy. But Attack Reels is the first reward. Status Reels is the second. Auroch Reels the third, and then finally the Jupiter Sigil.
[2022-12-27 14:11:58] <%Tormbo> Can you really make it problematic for yourself if you don't know what you're doing choosing jobs?
[2022-12-27 14:12:22] <%zazu1019> not really in TZA
[2022-12-27 14:12:39] <%zazu1019> but if you play the original in 12 yeah
[2022-12-27 14:12:48] <%Tormbo> Nah I got the steam version
[2022-12-27 14:12:54] <%+Lady_Lorr> @tormbo depends on how well you know this game. Seven and Bgg honestly have done this so many times, there may be struggling, but they will be okay
[2022-12-27 14:13:06] <%Neobullseye> It's still not worth grabbing in a race, but I'd definitely recommend picking up Attack Reels in casual or completionist runs.
[2022-12-27 14:13:17] <%Tormbo> And an eur and a jap ps2 version

[2022-12-27 14:14:26] <%+BreocDiesToGames> The zodiak age added so many quality of life features - FF12 was a strong game but I think most of the original complaints were fixed
[2022-12-27 14:14:44] <%oldandflexible> oh i thought next game was FFX-2 with dancing pad Kappa  Also hello Seven and chat.

[2022-12-27 14:17:33] VIEWERS: 557
[2022-12-27 14:17:41] <%Tormbo> The good part of this game is that you can pretty much grind LP infinitely
[2022-12-27 14:17:48] <%zazu1019> Probably should watch a video on Youtube about each job then kind of decide what you might want to use
[2022-12-27 14:18:07] <!%RyuPower> just paly around with the job setup, don't like how it is reset them
[2022-12-27 14:18:13] <%+Lady_Lorr> @tormbo I like jegged
[2022-12-27 14:18:31] <%+Lady_Lorr> sorry that was @peruaiado
[2022-12-27 14:18:40] <%Neobullseye> Honestly? Considering you have six characters and each character can pick up two Jobs now, you can just simply pick up all Jobs in between the six characters. Just avoid having too much overlap in between them.
[2022-12-27 14:18:42] <%Matriald> not informing myself beforehand and just play the game is what I'm trying to relearn...

[2022-12-27 14:19:47] <+PeruAIado> thx for the support <3
[2022-12-27 14:19:49] <%tcmatthews_jr> most of the guides are no really 100% accurate  truth is there is no real wrong choice unless you are overly concerned with min max
[2022-12-27 14:20:03] <%oldandflexible> same here. usually i go lore first when i play games first time
[2022-12-27 14:20:12] <%Neobullseye> And just for the record: Yes, there is a notable difference in stats in between all characters, but endgame gear more than makes up for that.
[2022-12-27 14:21:35] VIEWERS: 550
[2022-12-27 14:22:08] <%Neobullseye> The point of all of this being: just do whatever and you'll probably be fine. Well, as long as you don't actively gimp yourself by, say, grabbing three Archers Kappa
[2022-12-27 14:22:55] <%tcmatthews_jr> there are also hidden weapon affinities( speed) and crit rate that negate some of the obvious stat differences
[2022-12-27 14:23:09] <%GanD988> @PeruAIado you can do what i've done. Just search for the jobs combination and then play without reading anything alse.
[2022-12-27 14:23:17] <%zazu1019> You mean 3 archers aren't meta?

[2022-12-27 14:27:28] <%Democlis> in tza there are classes. each character can have 2 so no.

[2022-12-27 14:28:11] <%tcmatthews_jr> yes it does not matter I like Panella with white/Shiki  and Ash as Knight/Black
[2022-12-27 14:28:26] <%+fjzig> there is a vanilla board mod for ff12 on pc
[2022-12-27 14:28:38] <%zazu1019> gonna be plenty OP by the end anyhow
[2022-12-27 14:28:43] <%Lonefellow> (I'd just like to say how scary it is when Para posts grammatically correct sentences that make sense in context. sevenBlank )
[2022-12-27 14:28:51] <%zazu1019> and can always do things to become more OP if you're just playing for fun
[2022-12-27 14:29:23] <%MKataztrophy> That'll make it a whole new experience for me then, even though I beat the game prior on the original release version on console.
[2022-12-27 14:29:38] <%tcmatthews_jr> additional battle lores and magic lores make a difference

[2022-12-27 14:59:12] <%Lonefellow> 14 was first I think

[2022-12-27 15:00:27] <%TwitchTemplar> It has one of the best stories, but yh including things like triple triad which is one of the best thins about 8 lol
[2022-12-27 15:01:03] <%zazu1019> 12 is pretty hit or miss with people I think so shouldn't be too surprising?
[2022-12-27 15:01:42] <%zazu1019> The Eden stuff was straight up FF8 at spots lol

[2022-12-27 15:02:04] <%TwitchTemplar> Also to be best you kinda need to assume players had 1k+ hours to play it while even a long playthrough of others would be 100-200h at most
[2022-12-27 15:02:08] <%+MrZev> FF14 before the rework was also the WORST FF ever released
[2022-12-27 15:02:26] <%MasterVGuides> I don't like this game Kappa
[2022-12-27 15:02:54] <%+Lady_Lorr> Haters definitely show up in games they hate
[2022-12-27 15:03:00] <%MetalGearXicor> I never played this but I do like it very much
[2022-12-27 15:03:01] <%+MrZev> FF14 was the only FF where the CEO had a written appology of the quality of the game and vowed to fix it.
[2022-12-27 15:03:07] <%tcmatthews_jr> eLmaGus is the only one I know that does not like this game and  is vocal about it but dont know how much of that is just trolling
[2022-12-27 15:03:13] <%+MrZev> and im glad they did fix it.
[2022-12-27 15:03:46] <%MasterVGuides> You always have those people with FF12 that just echo the popular negative statements.

[2022-12-27 15:04:09] <%+Lady_Lorr> What I don't like about ff13 is it really doesn't feel like a final fantasy, but it is a good game

[2022-12-27 15:04:36] <%MasterVGuides> Sounds about right lol

[2022-12-27 15:26:01] <%InfaMouseMatt> this streamer doesn't just stream ff games, HERECY
[2022-12-27 15:26:03] <+GertLocker> too be fair you are most well known now for the fiesta
[2022-12-27 15:26:05] VIEWERS: 577
[2022-12-27 15:26:11] <The_SuperiorTaste> every stream is a fiesta
[2022-12-27 15:26:24] <%+Lady_Lorr> I watch you all year long, Seven sevenLove sevenLove sevenLove
[2022-12-27 15:26:29] <+GertLocker> well atleast you are aware
[2022-12-27 15:26:51] <+GertLocker> i lurk all the time
[2022-12-27 15:26:52] <%CynniUniflame> No Zelda anymore. Just Final Fantasy
[2022-12-27 15:26:54] <%Duxxors> i enjoyed the sneak peak at Tactics: Ogre, but didnt' watch it all because I hadn't played it ever
[2022-12-27 15:27:00] <%$RaptorGesus> My biggest problem is every year I watch the Fiesta and you get me in the mood to replay all the FF games
[2022-12-27 15:27:01] <%crfed> Nothing but love. You know I’ve supported your FIESTA for years. Just respectfully wondering how one can make a living considering I see you top chart ff streamer between November - January
[2022-12-27 15:27:07] <%CynniUniflame> No dark souls just final fantasy
[2022-12-27 15:27:20] <%$RaptorGesus> And I tell myself, "No. Not this year"..... I'm currently at the end of FF4 sevenClod
[2022-12-27 15:27:22] <%+Lady_Lorr> I just love the Fiesta the most of your content
[2022-12-27 15:27:34] <+Matequillo> I want to see Dragon Quest Fiesta
[2022-12-27 15:27:49] <%CynniUniflame> So what do people wanna see?
[2022-12-27 15:27:51] <%Duxxors> my goal is to finish FF7R finally this year BEFORE you guys get to it so that I can finally watch you play
[2022-12-27 15:27:52] <%iktasentrosi> I try to do the same viewership as I do during the Fiesta, but as a person from the US I don't get to catch you too often. sevenLove sevenLove sevenLove

[2022-12-27 15:28:23] <%CynniUniflame> The Pokémon streams were successful though!
[2022-12-27 15:28:30] <Amondrask> Personally I watch your stream for you, not the games. You're very soothing to listen to while doing other things, the RPGs are just a bonus C:
[2022-12-27 15:28:42] <%+Lady_Lorr> you have to live with yourself bggLove sevenLove
[2022-12-27 15:28:55] <%daimonologos> could do it like those guys that only steam Metal Gear. again and again and again and again sevenKEK
[2022-12-27 15:28:57] <%InfaMouseMatt> it also proves how much people love the ff games
[2022-12-27 15:29:13] <%Duxxors> in my defense, 93% of all streams i watch are FF related lol
[2022-12-27 15:29:19] <%+Lady_Lorr> but honestly bgg also has that same kind of viewership and things the rest of the year outside the fiesta, so it is not your fault
[2022-12-27 15:29:34] <%Lonefellow> Are you still doing the TIkToks Sev?
[2022-12-27 15:29:42] <%+Lady_Lorr> The fiesta is just that popular and amazing and we are very grateful for it
[2022-12-27 15:30:05] VIEWERS: 569
[2022-12-27 15:30:19] <%xJesta90> I mean if im honest, i watch based on the game over the streamer
[2022-12-27 15:30:54] <%InfaMouseMatt> i watch for the streamer not the game, if they are entertaining and engage with chat that's a win for me
[2022-12-27 15:31:38] <%ChuckVanGhost> This year should be good with FF16 though.  Or do you think that will be too saturated?
[2022-12-27 15:31:56] <%+Lady_Lorr> have you considered doing viewer choice like BGG does? I watch most of those cause they are thing I love
[2022-12-27 15:32:06] VIEWERS: 576
[2022-12-27 15:32:19] <+Matequillo> less nerdy
[2022-12-27 15:32:22] <%daimonologos> not niche?
[2022-12-27 15:32:24] <%Duxxors> I'm torn. I would love to watch FF16, but as always, I need to avoid spoilers until I can play it ><
[2022-12-27 15:32:34] <%crfed> Are you on tik tok, do you have reels and posts with hashtags on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Is that’s an ongoing best practice aside from the FIESTA to grow the target audience. No easy answers. I bet it’s tough.
[2022-12-27 15:32:40] <%oldandflexible> i`m meaning to ask this earlier but how did you and BGG came up with FF fiesta at first place. this is my 2nd fiesta and like to know how you came up with it?
[2022-12-27 15:32:57] <%schablam> you could always buy a hot tub..
[2022-12-27 15:33:13] <%ChuckVanGhost> I really dislike watching non FF streamers stream the new FFs.  That's just me, though.  Same with people who never like Nintendo, but try to jump on the new Nintendo release train.
[2022-12-27 15:33:14] <%schablam> rest and relaxation stream
[2022-12-27 15:33:33] <+Matequillo> SevenSins teaches Dutch
[2022-12-27 15:33:55] <%Lonefellow> At that point you need a social media guy but that's also an additional expense that's not simple to make if you're not a huge streamer
[2022-12-27 15:34:08] VIEWERS: 576
[2022-12-27 15:34:38] <%Lonefellow> Yes, that's exactly it
[2022-12-27 15:35:00] <%+Lady_Lorr> We love you, Seven bggLove sevenLove bggLove
[2022-12-27 15:35:17] <%xJesta90> Do you do FF speedruns?

[2022-12-27 15:36:32] <%+Kinitawowi> there are a lot of ff games that don't get played during the fiesta, mostly because there are a LOT of ff games Kappa

[2022-12-27 15:38:09] <%MasterVGuides> The first Fiesta was with Cereth, but Cereth wanted to pursue academics. Seven then found BGG and the rest is history.
[2022-12-27 15:39:25] <The_SuperiorTaste> didn't crumbs also do fffiesta or am I remembering wrong?
[2022-12-27 15:39:36] <%zazu1019> Is there something you need to do hunts for incentive wise this year?
[2022-12-27 15:39:40] <The_SuperiorTaste> crumps

[2022-12-27 15:40:45] <%Duxxors> LUL Para
[2022-12-27 15:40:57] <%+Lady_Lorr> @xjesta90 speedrunning is not a fix all. I know wr holders who don't have the viewers
[2022-12-27 15:41:01] <!%$Demadizzle> I agree Para rooBot
[2022-12-27 15:41:04] <%InfaMouseMatt> speed runs can be stressfull plus you can't chat to stream if doing those types of runs
[2022-12-27 15:41:09] <%Duxxors> Speedruns are hard to get back into with kids as well
[2022-12-27 15:41:13] <%Duxxors> they take so much dedication
[2022-12-27 15:41:26] <%+KickinAss07> There was sum1 apart from cereth i believe, but I was def not a fan of him personally haha
[2022-12-27 15:41:38] <%+MrZev> there is no way i could mentally handle speedrunning seriously.
[2022-12-27 15:41:47] <%+Lady_Lorr> @kickinass07 there was, but it is not a good story for streaming
[2022-12-27 15:42:01] <%+Lady_Lorr> @kickinass07 and it was before fiesta
[2022-12-27 15:42:03] <%Felknia_> Is the Fiesta making you competitive as well or does the timer not matter as much?
[2022-12-27 15:42:05] <%+MrZev> i would just race friends for fun... but going for WR is too much

[2022-12-27 15:42:38] <%Duxxors> every year we get to 12 and im reminded i must go back and play it to completion
[2022-12-27 15:42:40] <%iktasentrosi> It's a race, but it's more for entertainment purposes.
[2022-12-27 15:42:53] <%GanD988> plus if you speedrun ff7 were you need to be on steproute + paying attention to fights and 7hrs run is harder than a 1-2hrs run were you can take 30 min pause between runs and talk with chat
[2022-12-27 15:42:55] <%xJesta90> @lady_lorr i know its not the be all, im just throwing out ideas i think would be cool content
[2022-12-27 15:43:14] <%GanD988> megaman x runs were fun and good interaction with you SevenSins
[2022-12-27 15:43:15] <%+Lady_Lorr> @xjesta90 for sure!!! I was just saying.
[2022-12-27 15:43:30] <%xJesta90> The reason i suggest it, is cause being honest Sevens vibes combined with like a speedrun goal to get invested in would be so good
[2022-12-27 15:44:05] <%+Lady_Lorr> The fiesta was born from some speedrunning events Seven did with Cereth, whom I was a fan of and how I discovered Seven

[2022-12-27 15:44:32] <bromdr> Metroid Dread speedruns were also fun.
[2022-12-27 15:44:50] <%GanD988> fff is a speedrun in it's way.
[2022-12-27 15:44:52] <%zazu1019> Truth people bail on streamers if they go outside of what they want to watch except for a few loyal people who are a part of the community

[2022-12-27 15:46:58] <%crfed> Speed runner  success example: Caleb had ten fold more viewers and social media that in the end generate him tons of revenue, however, with all due respect, the zheals and the few others have far better world records than him in the categories he focused on. Again, target audience and social media marketing to that
[2022-12-27 15:47:06] <%CynniUniflame> Celes!
[2022-12-27 15:47:24] <%JGGs_Mini_Me> @JGGs_Mini_Me that's right, 7's go 2 now SeemsGood sevenLove

[2022-12-27 16:27:05] <%daimonologos> it does have a license
[2022-12-27 16:27:12] <%MasterVGuides> Karkata is something you can steal from the Flowering Cactoid in like the third Trial.
[2022-12-27 16:27:15] <%xJesta90> it does, penelo might have it on her knight board
[2022-12-27 16:27:17] <%detlion1643> never actually did trial mode, why does that trivialize the game?

[2022-12-27 18:01:18] <janinebats> Fun fact, Reks (Yuri Lowenthal) voices the protagonist in Abyss. And there's a Van in that game as well. Also, both games released in America around the same time.
