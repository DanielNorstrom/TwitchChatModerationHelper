Sloppy steaks at Truffoni's. Big rare cut of meat with water dumped all over it, water splashing around the table, makes the night SO MUCH more fun. After the club go to Truffoni's for sloppy steaks. They'd say; 'no sloppy steaks' but they can't stop you from ordering a steak and a glass of water, before you knew it we were dumping that water on those steaks!
[2022-12-30 01:11:31] <+odybsunshine05> I like to inject my steaks with ketchup so they can still be juicy despite being well done.

[2022-12-30 01:57:01] <%+lucasdotmp4> Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known.

[2022-12-30 06:53:35] <thegodlywindz> If the dog sits it gives them probable cause to search
[2022-12-30 06:53:36] <Fruitneck> yeah it gives them probable cause
[2022-12-30 06:53:40] <%+stug6704> if dog signals then they have probable cause

[2022-12-30 06:53:42] <DarkRoastLove> yup and there are officers that have confessed to false k9 hits
[2022-12-30 06:53:43] <$Duce_Face> You don’t need consent for the dog. The dog can give probable cause to allow them to search
[2022-12-30 06:53:47] <gkplaysgames_> it's one of those talking dogs
[2022-12-30 06:53:51] <%snollygoose> If he would’ve told me about the gun he woulda been straight
[2022-12-30 06:53:53] <%HarrisonsGodFather> To make a "false flag" and then use that against the dude, so he offers consent. NEVER GIVE constent. In FL dogs in most counties are no longer used
[2022-12-30 06:53:56] <+omgitsbooma> it's a trick to get him to consent even if the dog hits on the car they can't search without your consent
[2022-12-30 06:53:56] <%+stug6704> kinda wack but it is what it is
[2022-12-30 06:53:58] <%+creatinemilkenjoyer> they can bring the dogs certifications to question in court.

Over the past month he's starting using terms like "pog", "jabaited", and "Kappa" which I guess are terms that are used in the scope of Twitch. I don't have an issue with my son using these terms but it's gotten to the point where every sentence is Twitchspeak.

[2022-12-30 11:31:39] <%itskrazo> The dog can be ran around the vehicle no matter the situation it’s if it hits or not that means if you can search or not
[2022-12-30 11:31:52] <%shnazzle> @itskrazo na im sayin im pretty sure they need reasonable suspicion to even bring the k9 out
[2022-12-30 11:32:10] <%itskrazo> Not if a K-9 unit is the one who stopped you
[2022-12-30 11:32:13] <%itskrazo> Which it was

[2022-12-30 11:33:13] <+iRedlayer> k-9s can be used as long as they are within the parameters of a valid traffic stop; they can be invalidated in court if you have to wait for a k-9 though...

[2022-12-30 12:54:43] <tjsmith091> @imaPijiN Turn off Binural Audio I get 60 fps on streets still rubber bands but its playable
[2022-12-30 12:55:16] <centralcree> Even @trey24k showed earlier he got like 80-90 on lighthouse then turned off binaural and got like over 120 im pretty sure
[2022-12-30 12:55:18] <tjsmith091> @imaPijiN I also have 2070 thats why im telling u
[2022-12-30 12:55:29] <$imaPijiN> the rubber banding is wild tho. sometimes i teleport back a step or two which is whatever and sometimes i teleport back to like 2 minutes ago

[2022-12-30 15:04:49] <+e2tic> 40 in a 35 should be a ticket if you’re actually doing 75

[2022-12-30 16:18:46] <@%^StreamElements> the stupidest thing about it is if they really wanted to ban cheaters it would be easy all they gotta look for is codes that have been changed if u know coding u understand what i mean its not hard to find out when someone changes the codes the only reason they don’t is cuz the money the cheaters bring its facts technically they could make a dummy server and anyone with changed codes aka cheaters could be singled out and always sent to a dummy server

[2022-12-30 17:53:25] <himmothy17> kin exposure is not expected to lead to toxicity due to its extremely poor penetration of the skin barrier, and symptoms of intoxication from skin exposure are unlikely. If your skin is exposed to fentanyl, you should wash the area with water as quickly as possible.

[2022-12-30 17:55:44] <%jack_beamzz> @monkimonki_ there are literally 100s of factors. But fent in a powder can’t be absorbed through skin. Either inhaled some or was having a reaction to a cutting agent. I’ve seen the video ypur talking about. There is also no contraindications for narcan. You can narcan anyone and it will not adversely affect them that’s why it’s so widely used in case we’re OD is suspected
