[2022-12-10 05:52:41] <@%^Nightbot> I'm telling you, Taxi2g is as cracked as he is jacked. I saw him at 7-11 the other day buying Redbull and adult-diapers. When I asked him what the adult diapers were for he said 'They contain my full power so I don't completely shit on these kids.' Then he bunnyhopped out the door.

[2022-12-10 13:18:58] <shortyyyy_1> @taxi2g if i lock my fps at 60 game always runs at 59 fps whys that?
[2022-12-10 13:19:00] <gh0st_admiral> @thecrookthatcancook Yes but I can't Tapstrafe like taxi does
[2022-12-10 13:19:10] <+TheViper1xD> honestly don't really care but idk imo no matter what u play they all should be on the same playing field @ScholarAU
[2022-12-10 13:19:23] <%thecrookthatcancook> gh0st_admiral i was thinking NODDERS maybe you need to hit space to get the tap strafe, just like the first jump off octane pad
[2022-12-10 13:19:28] <harsh477> @shortyyyy_1 thats how the in game limiter works i think
[2022-12-10 13:19:34] <+TheViper1xD> if 1 does something the other should be able to do so as well
[2022-12-10 13:19:34] <harsh477> always 1 less
[2022-12-10 13:19:36] <%ScholarAU> @TheViper1xD okay so u agree removing aim assist as well as removing tap strafing?

[2022-12-10 13:20:03] <+TheViper1xD> even tho total removal is kinda overkill I think AA does need a nerf
[2022-12-10 13:20:07] <shortyyyy_1> so i should be using 145 for my monitor? pepoG
[2022-12-10 13:20:15] <bettervi> why is it capping at 140 fps with this 10k pc?
[2022-12-10 13:20:17] <%thecrookthatcancook> pepoG aye
[2022-12-10 13:20:34] <+zekutopgum> @shortyyyy_1 yes, cuz we know your monitor lmao
[2022-12-10 13:20:34] <irezumii216> do the servers being 20 tick limit us from a lotta things or are 60 tick servers not that important for apex?

[2022-12-10 13:20:55] <+SOL_AsTr0> @bettervi yea i dont know why too, unless he has 144hz he doesnt need more as well as if he stream on single pc
[2022-12-10 13:21:00] <!1girth> Are you gonna watch Engerland win the world cup
[2022-12-10 13:21:05] <+zekutopgum> maybe learning superglides are easier on 140 than 240
[2022-12-10 13:21:06] <DevilAngel8> @bettervi apegz extremely unstable above 190 and 140-190 isnt much diff so most people cap at 140
[2022-12-10 13:21:14] <%+Signori_> 3Head
[2022-12-10 13:21:18] <+zekutopgum> I lost my consistency of supreglides when I moved from 190 to 240

[2022-12-10 13:21:45] <+SOL_AsTr0> @bettervi that was issue long time ago, thats fixed. But Apex overall has stutters issues
[2022-12-10 13:21:45] <WitchyWay> @taxi2g Are you testing something right now? or new setup or warmup..?

[2022-12-10 13:40:04] <+TheViper1xD> yeah not totally sure about that 1 cuz remember u can literally just tap strafe around corners and wall jumping into a advantageous position while the person chasing *assuming on controller* would have to perform the same technique *which isn't possible* therefore resulting the chasing player to run in a easy choke or a predictable area giving the other a clear advantage. And I don't really understand how u can say Tap strafing counters AA while I just see it as extra movement. @ScholarAU
