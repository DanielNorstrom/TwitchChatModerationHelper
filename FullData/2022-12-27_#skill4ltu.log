[2022-12-27 00:44:40] <%NunexTK> @skill4ltu imo they should make it so that drowned tanks´ hp still counts for damage and marks. it would immediately drop all the complaints about it. If someone drowns someone else they get all the hp for it

[2022-12-27 00:46:52] <Tiplik1> i can see trolls pushing tanks into thr water xf
[2022-12-27 00:46:53] <%chirop_> what if yo get pushed into the water and drown
[2022-12-27 00:46:55] <decxsi> 30 minutes in WoT means 6+ battles
[2022-12-27 00:47:01] <cabix69XXX_pl> 30mins is 10 battles Kappa
[2022-12-27 00:47:01] <%swgchef> @Tiplik1 yup
[2022-12-27 00:47:02] <%Pierre_Dole> 30 mins in wot is like 6 games @skill4ltu
[2022-12-27 00:47:04] <BeholderGuard> loooooool
[2022-12-27 00:47:06] <%+times_ticking> Intentional drowning is a 1 day ban according to the rules
[2022-12-27 00:47:09] <%NunexTK> if you get pushed into the watter someone else gets the kill credit
[2022-12-27 00:47:12] <RedEyeSC2> is 430U worth the grind
[2022-12-27 00:47:12] <%mr_breathless> I think Skill is right. at least 24 hours.. I wqould even prefer 2 days
[2022-12-27 00:47:15] <+Nasdasdy> 30 minutes in WoT Time is... like 30 battles!
[2022-12-27 00:47:15] <loleks808> so do it a week i don't care
[2022-12-27 00:47:16] <%+kissfarkasendre> @skill4ltu what if my tank is messy and i want to wash it down?
[2022-12-27 00:47:20] VIEWERS: 5 689
[2022-12-27 00:47:22] <+7NEPHILIM> 6 hours would be perfect
[2022-12-27 00:47:22] <DieseLLL_> a lot of artys would be locked
[2022-12-27 00:47:25] <%NunexTK> the game already distinguishes between self drown and someone else drowning you
[2022-12-27 00:47:30] <Rico1spoczko> I had done building my Lego Lambo countach. Wanna see?
[2022-12-27 00:47:30] <@%momix99> @chirop_ the game already detects such things. it can decide pretty well between drowning yourself and getting drowned by either allies or enemies
[2022-12-27 00:47:37] <%+naugtmellon> But what is if an enemy pushes you into the water and u drown?
[2022-12-27 00:47:41] <+aitokonna> drown on accident and pay the price and you wont drown again
[2022-12-27 00:47:49] <nordsenser> 1600 matches never dronwed
[2022-12-27 00:47:51] <%NunexTK> @naugtmellon the game already distinguishes between self drown and someone else drowning you so
[2022-12-27 00:47:53] <DaDsIrishMadman> what really sucks is they give you Arnie last year, I put in a russain tank, and this year I get the Arnie tank and can't put him in as the commander because you can't change countries, Russian
[2022-12-27 00:48:03] <+ClementvW> I drowned 2x in 13 years
[2022-12-27 00:48:05] <IulyAlb> @skill4ltu what if someone pushes you into the water and you drown?
[2022-12-27 00:48:06] <harald33> just no credits gain at all and xp for the match
[2022-12-27 00:48:10] <nameless_liquidace> Or after second drown in one day 24 hours account blocked
[2022-12-27 00:48:13] <makanake1> why u even drown ur tank ? why ? what's the reason behind ?
[2022-12-27 00:48:16] <%mr_breathless> @naugtmellon thats a good point
[2022-12-27 00:48:29] <%+times_ticking> @skill4ltu Bad idea for new players/new accounts
[2022-12-27 00:48:31] <%taubenkaiser> Last time I drowned is probably 6 months ago
[2022-12-27 00:48:34] <%+Vulgar_Display_Of_Power_> I alos drowned maybe 10 times in 10 years
[2022-12-27 00:48:41] <+ClementvW> i think 40.000 games played
[2022-12-27 00:48:43] <@%momix99> i drowned at least 5 times in Mannerheim Line before deciding not to cross there anymore LUL

[2022-12-27 00:48:53] <elektro_giant> give them higher tier match making for drowning. the lower tier tanks in a battle will usually have less effect than a top tier.
[2022-12-27 00:48:56] <Lymesh> heh, I've just drown :(
[2022-12-27 00:48:59] <%Rankone1> @skill4ltu I leave for whole day and you are still going strong!? I hope you are having good session.
[2022-12-27 00:49:01] <freddy2111> Diving tanks would solve the problem for sure
[2022-12-27 00:49:02] <DaDsIrishMadman> what really sucks is they give you Arnie last year, I put in a Russian tank, and this year I get the Arnie tank and can't put him in as the commander because you can't change countries, Russian
[2022-12-27 00:49:03] <%+peter6345> @Vulgar_Display_Of_Power_ how dare you!
[2022-12-27 00:49:09] <%$F0R_M07H3R_RU5514> it's physics abuse on NA server, but they treat it as a minor infraction ... I think it is a terrible thing to be permitted
[2022-12-27 00:49:17] <loleks808> I last 30 games I had a 2-3 dudes that drowned or crashed the self at start of the battle

[2022-12-27 00:50:37] <Canovar_> hard to tell if it is its front or back of this tank LUL
[2022-12-27 00:50:39] <@%momix99> @Deweiler88 you know it :D
[2022-12-27 00:51:01] <80Ganesha> Whats up with so many teams completely ignoring one flank? 70% of my games today, my team just completely ignores one flank
[2022-12-27 00:51:10] <Rattenbury> @Tiplik1 Ive been playing it a lot this holiday season, it makes so much money
[2022-12-27 00:51:11] <abalazs> no more allchat, no more team damage, arta is weak, and i cant even drown myself? how do i supposed to release steam then?
[2022-12-27 00:51:13] <Deweiler88> @momix99 yeah maybe with my death another person get 3 gunmark so im happy for them :D

[2022-12-27 00:52:21] <Jadarite> Ever since I got new internet, every day I have a 50% chance to drown or 50% chance to drive straight across the map into the enemy team because my net restarts every day between 20h-24h. Hilarious... @skill4ltu
[2022-12-27 00:52:26] <%ulleb0y> How does the tank feel? @skill4ltu
[2022-12-27 00:52:32] <+UncleCrimson> @skill4ltu Is your fireextinguisher filled with powder? If so, get rid of it! It will do a bigger damage to your interior than nessesary. Get a one filled with foam, or CO2 for your PCs. Try out the one with powder, but outside! You can thank me later !!!1!

[2022-12-27 13:18:49] <Dr_Kry4n> Hi guys and @skill4ltu! I wanted to play with my STRV S1 again after like 4 years, and I've just found out it had been nerfed to the ground... The accuracy is worse by 25%, the movement speed is also worse and the turn speed has also been F-ed. Is it fair? Is WG nerfing premium tanks now??

[2022-12-27 14:04:52] <%+Pandatoofu> WoT needs to put in a 4th Gunmark for 100% for you @skill4ltu ;D
[2022-12-27 14:04:56] <HaroMangala> @Pandatoofu the point is that tanks with armour are useless when ever one spams gold ...t10 battles is just gold ammo ...
[2022-12-27 14:04:56] <@%momix99> sure @kunigasrajone
[2022-12-27 14:05:08] <%greentea998> is it harder to go from 3rd mark to 100% than from 2nd mark to 3rd
[2022-12-27 14:05:15] <kunigasrajone> @momix99  preciate that
[2022-12-27 14:05:18] <%yogrizzlypapamt> @skill4ltu Good morning from Montana, hope your feeling like freesh pickle 🥒
[2022-12-27 14:05:22] <%LosWitos> @momix99 i don't believe that, i think you took maus and let the enemies farm you so 10 of them got the marks skilHa
[2022-12-27 14:05:24] <%+Pandatoofu> @HaroMangala Well of course you want to get the best out of your tank thats why they use gold

[2022-12-27 14:40:32] <%CrazyCoolCrum> they always pick the worst time to talk
[2022-12-27 14:40:40] <Dr_Kry4n> btw is the +/- 2 MM ever going to change? It definetly feels like unplayable nowadays becuase of the crazy broken high tier tanks... That's the main reason T9 is great, because you have a way to fight against a 1 tier higher opponent, but not against a 2 tier higher. Also new tanks are getteng balanced in order to be competitive against 2 tier higher tanks (like the Vipera, the Arnie or the BZ) and they'll be crazy OP in their tier, and unkillable when playing against 2 tier lower opponents...

[2022-12-27 14:49:06] <%+paxilpopr> @skill4ltu Personally I'm not against people paying money for someone else to finish their missions. However, doing it at the expense of other players by putting shitty teammates on the other side isn't okay.
[2022-12-27 14:49:08] <%$balysheep91> thanks*

[2022-12-27 14:50:27] <huhowsky> Hi Skill. What happened with STG?It is one of my favourite tanks.

[2022-12-27 14:52:56] <+mohk96g> @skill4ltu It is the fault of WG to introduce a stupid a fk tank as reward noone would pay for a bad tank

[2022-12-27 14:53:15] <%Maitner_> @skill4ltu I've just watched the vid and I think there is one more important point ... lets say wg has 1000 devs, it is impossible for 1000 people to find out what 100k-million will, so there always will be a way to bypass what devs thought of. It is better for them to focus on hard cheat engines and game being good rather than this

[2022-12-27 14:54:06] <jallija2022> WG shold sell this tank for 500$ if u buy it u deserv it , Then u make this game playebel for free to play plyers . U need to understand WG is company on nothing is free on this world

[2022-12-27 14:54:50] <%yogrizzlypapamt> @chirop_ I think marking tanks is difficult this month unless ur very good player
[2022-12-27 14:54:53] <%+Kumursga> it's simple, take it or leave it

[2022-12-27 14:55:15] <%Maitner_> @skill4ltu in short I just wanted to say it is technically impossible to fix rigging, so being surprised or fighting it is waste of time
[2022-12-27 14:55:26] <bozwolf1907> there are a lot of bad player in the game?
[2022-12-27 14:55:28] <+clayton_bigsby_IV> and rigging will disappear

[2022-12-27 14:58:33] <@%momix99> @keicam_1918 it means getting progress in the game in a unfair way basicaly.
[2022-12-27 14:58:35] <%janjakuburbanik> @skill4ltu i mean in real life, too much toxicity for no reason.
[2022-12-27 14:58:40] <%NathanB9217> @skill4ltu I think it's not the worst issue ever, on a personal level it will maybe affect 1 of my games over a long time? and its not really any worse than half of the teams/MM I get anyway. Only time I ever had an issue was when I was being pushed out for their friend to farm and they didnt shoot eachother. I reported it to wargaming and they both got a ban. I think people just always want something to complain about and to blame someone else.
[2022-12-27 14:58:41] <szbence465> @skill4ltu So, how is your relationship with Claus?

[2022-12-27 15:01:59] <+rammmmmmbo> really skill? you are mixing things up in my opinion. One thing is real life and this is a game. And talking about this matter, we are talking about the game. Rigging matters when we are speaking only about the game and not outside the game and real life. When we go to real life, any game hás

[2022-12-27 15:11:29] <+sgt_pigpen> aparently they are getting nerfed.. i hope they don't nerf the prem... its fun now, but still frustrating

[2022-12-27 15:11:44] <%+big_yellow_banana> @skill4ltu on video wg said thay will update some tank so maybe they will do for liberte as well??
[2022-12-27 15:11:45] <trackkills> WG has to keep nerfing and making improved tanks to keep selling them and to keep the game going, so basically we are hamsters on the wheel.

[2022-12-27 15:14:03] <46sotos> cant WG put more countries in tech tree or they go by history?

[2022-12-27 15:14:12] <%Cynthic> right now a new player looking to buy premiums can get the meta ones and skip the older tanks, if they buffed the older ones they would have a reason to buy them @skill4ltu , both he old and new ones.

[2022-12-27 15:14:52] <tamnex021> do you think blackdog is good tank for bonds
[2022-12-27 15:15:00] <%+Pandatoofu> @Cynthic But the percentage would be lower, with new tank they have old and new players buying it
[2022-12-27 15:15:03] <%chirop_> they do have that trade in every now and then were you can trade in your old premium for new one at discount
[2022-12-27 15:15:10] <beyonddemon> opinion on udes 15/16?
[2022-12-27 15:15:13] <%Kristion1990> most meta tanks are behind overpriced bundles or appear in certain periods of the year, most that u can buy anytime are crap

[2022-12-27 15:15:14] <%EpherealX> @skill4ltu I rang WG about bad premiums and when they stopped crying about my story they showed me the new premiums I could buy, they do care

[2022-12-27 15:16:18] <%+Emaus_GingerBeard> @skill4ltu i think it would be better to nerf all tanks to the begining state to perform tank role. not like t10 HT with 400m viewrange.
[2022-12-27 15:16:28] <%Cynthic> @Pandatoofu i think they have enough devs to make them all worth playing and thus being bought. 20 good tanks to buy, vs 10 good tanks to buy. which gets more sales?
[2022-12-27 15:16:34] <disnomic> @46sotos there's no more countries with enough tanks for a complete tech tree, WG will need to get inventive

[2022-12-27 15:16:53] <socialgeograf> @46sotos A simple question, where did the metal for the Type 5 heavy come from in Japan? If, the entire tank army of Japan, if submitted for remelting, would not be able to provide enough metal to create the Type 5 Heavy. So what is the "historicity" here?
[2022-12-27 15:16:53] <46sotos> @46sotos ok ty
[2022-12-27 15:16:54] <%Maitner_> @iamhereonlyfordrops It has normal mode and turbo mode, in normal it is I think slightly faster than leo but has normal acc, in turbo it is much faster but not rly accurate at all

[2022-12-27 15:17:35] <%+Pandatoofu> @Cynthic But if they buff older tanks, people would maybe not buy a new one because the old one is good enough you see?
[2022-12-27 15:17:37] <%questmo> @skill4ltu  and any company would actively try and get rid of those rotten apples ... it's WG turn to answer, their silence on the subject speaks volumes.

[2022-12-27 15:21:54] <%Cynthic> @Pandatoofu oh i get it, but every time they release a newer OP tank it makes everyone skip the old one it replaces in the meta. So all new players pass over the old tanks. If they were ALL viable then they would have a reason to buy both the new and old tanks

[2022-12-27 17:58:37] <%Viktor___Wolf> @skill4ltu Serious idea for Index:  The equip slot suggestions don't include the "Slot Category" that gives extra bonus for item.  Some new players may not get it.   Some of the CC suggestions have items in order that don't give bonuses.  Any way to sort them for new people?

[2022-12-27 19:10:33] [Announcement] <Moobot> Skill4ltu is running automated ads. They will run every 30 minutes and last 2.5 minutes. Skill will try to warn you a few moments before they appear.
[2022-12-27 19:10:36] <alexei1242> you could create a section on index specifically for tourists Kappa Kappa

[2022-12-27 20:08:48] <Vitex_N> @skill4ltu for me the only bad thing about artas is that they cause damage even while not hitting the target, for example you're sitting behind the rock, arty shoots the rock or the ground next to you and still cause 200-300 dmg. If player hits, then obviously it should be awarded with dmg

[2022-12-27 20:49:15] <%+Pinseloehrchen> You are correct but isn‘t that just because wg brought higher numbers? More autoloaders, more dpm, more pen and so on? So with lower numbers and more weakspots and of course better maps it would be better. But that is just me :) @skill4ltu

[2022-12-27 21:19:21] <@%evofrogmr> @LittleNoisy because when you start a new game, that game so far you have 0 damage
[2022-12-27 21:19:29] <G0urami> well, in CSGO there is a ban offence called "griefing"... so if you troll/afk and so on, you get banned for a month, next ban is perma :D

[2022-12-27 21:19:40] <@%Nyxphobia> @LittleNoisy When you start the battle, it counts as you did 0 damage so if you don't do anything in the game, it will lower your MoE to that %

[2022-12-27 21:36:20] <some_friendly_guy_u_know> Good day skill @skill4ltu , just finished watching your latest video and im quit shocked. As of most of the comment were saying,  you are in the wrong, about the grind especialy. Its not that people are to lazy to grind, there way more factors to this as having not enough time or just the game's grinding system... either way im worried that this will affect your reputation since i have a lots of respect to you for what you do.
[2022-12-27 21:36:21] <%irjdr> is that overmatch @skill4ltu ?

[2022-12-27 22:40:20] <+wicky1337_> i definitely do not touch this Tank anymore. Did 4k dmg in the first match ez and it felt weird, ´cause    I´m beginner in WoT

[2022-12-27 22:40:34] <WaffythePanda> i think it is a broken tank and needs to be nerfed
[2022-12-27 22:40:38] <+falthael> I've been ammo racked on first hit in a match more in BZ than any other tank

[2022-12-27 22:47:11] <Sir_SiNNer> i used to like claus few years ago. when he was just commenting replays on his channel. but that changed , he is a mediocre player complaining about everything. too toxic for a bad player. he shouldve stayed at commenting replays
[2022-12-27 22:47:14] <%liana69420> Wargaming should put a tank in the game with the best armor lazer gun good speed

[2022-12-27 22:56:00] <%Rodzjer> more like 430u which was bouncing more shots than heavies
[2022-12-27 22:56:03] <GunnerWanted> @skill4ltu you know ... if you have a hard time spending all your credits, you could consider mounting real (large) repair and med kit ... just saying (wink wink).
[2022-12-27 22:56:08] <sleepyNessi> That's a nice looking tank
[2022-12-27 22:56:08] <%+rambokai> @crazycanuck68 I take aim device, rammer, and optics on mine, it has good base stabilization and low speed so doesnt bloom much.
[2022-12-27 22:56:19] <%uploader51> defender is so weak in current meta
[2022-12-27 22:56:42] <+falthael> peregrin is such a pretty tank
[2022-12-27 22:56:42] <%+gamingmode92> @skill4ltu i loved to play renegade before bz came out,its hard to play against bz.
[2022-12-27 22:56:45] <Tiplik1> wg is crazy , if people complain about how broken is one tank, they just create more broken new one xd
[2022-12-27 22:56:45] <stralit> I sold Defender, not good and not a fun tank

[2022-12-27 22:59:31] <%+rambokai> @The_MTD I was thinking of this the other day, could have 4 rockets mounted on the roof that you fire off then takes a minute or two to reload... and its so tiny you cant hit it while it drives around or hides :P

[2022-12-27 22:59:51] <%tayrren> there are more tanks like this that will be introduced in wot in 2023...that's why they do what they do, I think that this game will end up like the other games, much too complex or complicated, or in other words, modern, I don't know how to express myself exactly

[2022-12-27 23:02:26] <%Cynthic> for old players that already have the old tanks that makes sense, for new players they would buy the old ones IF they were good still.

[2022-12-27 23:02:45] <Ap3L1nc0ln> @skill4ltu  the difference is, if a car company wants to sell odler models, they have to keep building them which costs money. Old tanks already exist, it would cost WG nothing to keep them in shape

[2022-12-27 23:04:58] <Tiplik1> i just wonder, if people complain about some broken tank they create just more broken new one, why did they delete waffle, not created better one xd
[2022-12-27 23:05:04] <+archoncommando> @skill4ltu i think char was a good prem they should just make more silly but fun without being oppressing vehicles like that
[2022-12-27 23:05:04] <degewon> @Intimidat0r i came back to wot recently and haven't seen enough stuff i guess, thanks for letting me know
[2022-12-27 23:05:14] <Bluecher78> wow, t-54 ist still a beast, long time not played this tank

[2022-12-27 23:05:39] <davidlee54> those rockets on bz are a bit too much of an arcade element in the game
[2022-12-27 23:05:42] <%+IgnatioCabron> EpherealX and the boxes cost 100 BTC each
[2022-12-27 23:05:44] <%+spiritx522> they wont nerf bz bcs there was big panic and complaining when they nerfed type 59 back in 2013

[2022-12-27 23:06:31] <Reagan_Doctrine> You're invading his personal space
[2022-12-27 23:06:32] <%Cynthic> @Intimidat0r that only makes sense if they are deliberately power creeping the old tanks into uselessness, if the players realize it why would they buy any new tanks? fix old ones and 100% of player base would realize all prem tank purchases are actually worthwhile.

[2022-12-27 23:09:12] <%+TheLAFFEY> @skill4ltu I 3 marked 122tm. you think it is worth to keep it?
[2022-12-27 23:09:19] <+tankachu_twch> @skill4ltu What do you think about Renegade at the current game vs BZ and other tanks?
[2022-12-27 23:09:23] <@^StreamElements> Are you interested in Skill's Favourite Tier X Tanks? Just check out this YT playlist: shorturl.at/cMS78
[2022-12-27 23:09:25] <iron_wall_> @skill4ltu  and the pelegin you mark?
[2022-12-27 23:09:35] <$Intimidat0r> @Cynthic they have been doing that for ages, all premium tanks for like 3 or 4 years are better than the normal ones in  a way or have special abilities, really OP tanks arent sold anymore, i'm sure they won sell the BZ its like the Premium EBR, its about making money but in the end they will kill the game unless thay can keep making new generations play the game

[2022-12-27 23:10:08] <%EpherealX> @skill4ltu I think the next big innovation for wargaming would be for the maps to be fully deformable, how awesome would it be if you could push that wall down and get a new angle

[2022-12-27 23:10:13] <%+Empty0123> 3 marks and you cant answer this for yourself?
[2022-12-27 23:10:15] <%+kriskaem> ok, i found solution. To win 3 battles with Type59 u need to watch "Taboo  movie, take a drink and then play again
[2022-12-27 23:10:20] <antonis360r> Can someone tell me why did they add armor perc rounds on the arty's????
[2022-12-27 23:10:24] <%Cynthic> @Bishox I agree many people take the short view of things, not everyone does. WG would like this game to be around for another decade or more, a long range plan would be best from their point of view IF they bother to think of it.
[2022-12-27 23:10:29] <%+TheLAFFEY> @Bishox yeah. I don't mind the tank, but I have other chinese meds to play

[2022-12-27 23:12:14] <%warbeastn> @deadworld99 check the index out for every tank, best index in the game
[2022-12-27 23:12:15] <%ironmillos> do you think a real tank could shoot a shell through a hole like that?
[2022-12-27 23:12:16] <%Cynthic> @Intimidat0r i have noticed that most of the highly rated prem tanks on the index are only available for real money and not in game gold. which was a bummer to realize as it sort of devalues gold itself.
