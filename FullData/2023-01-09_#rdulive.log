[2023-01-09 14:06:31] <beepbeepbeep3> Many writers accidentally use the wrong spelling in their work, which can confuse the reader or make their work look unprofessional. So how do you know if you're using the right one? The short answer is that wether is a male goat or sheep, whether means “if,” and weather means the state of the atmosphere.

[2023-01-09 16:43:43] <%+mansfield11235> Streamers get quite low compensation from the sub.   You pay 5 Euro, which is taxed (depends on country), but usually 21%. After that cut is applied. Normal streamers get 50%, RDU is a partner and gets at least 70%. This translates to about 2.765 Euro per sub.

[2023-01-09 18:07:55] <+carrotymail> @twitchnamestaken They are only good as they help other minions. Like mechs summoned during combat refresh the Shield bots shields
[2023-01-09 18:07:56] <%chennnnnny> itll get zapped anyway
[2023-01-09 18:07:56] <+dizzyman667> depends how you evaluate 40 attack
[2023-01-09 18:07:57] <simp_hs> Murloc
[2023-01-09 18:07:59] <%+CAROLINO> he is gonna zap you probably anyway

[2023-01-09 18:08:25] <+shallowthought> how long does brann stick around is my question
[2023-01-09 18:08:34] <%+twitchnamestaken> For Jandice Barov, a guide says "if you find an early token, hero power the main body every single turn" what does this mean
[2023-01-09 18:08:39] <Kam9l> @LukechicagoIL everytime u buff curator amalgam this minion get twice it stats
[2023-01-09 18:08:47] <4r0nL> @LukechicagoIL whenever amalgam gains stats it gains it twice
[2023-01-09 18:08:53] <LukechicagoIL> Nice!! thanks @Kam9l @4r0nL

[2023-01-09 18:09:09] <+carrotymail> No Teamaster
[2023-01-09 18:09:13] <+dizzyman667> omega1 turn can work
[2023-01-09 18:09:34] <%+thejookeer_> Yepge
[2023-01-09 18:09:35] <Craydy> @twitchnamestaken For example if you get the 1/1 Beast that spawns another one, you can just hero power both spawned units to make them better.
