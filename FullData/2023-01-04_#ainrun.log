[2023-01-04 09:46:01] <staleycameron> Lemurs are prosimians, a type of primate. Other primates include monkeys, apes and humans. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, where they evolved in isolation. Unlike monkeys, lemurs have a moist nose and rely more heavily on their sense of smell.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind t

[2023-01-04 11:17:27] <%MadKingHyperion> defense is a flat number based on level, i think
[2023-01-04 11:17:27] <jollygatr> that is tied to your lvl
[2023-01-04 11:17:27] <brucenson> defense is flat reduction, negation is % reduction
[2023-01-04 11:17:42] <%MadKingHyperion> the negation is % of the damage received after flat reduction
[2023-01-04 11:17:45] <%Bradxkillyou> Defense is a flat amount of damage subtracted from incoming attacks, after that the remaining damage is reduced by Negation
[2023-01-04 11:17:49] <%Bradxkillyou> IIRC

[2023-01-04 11:26:11] <+Cerebral_Tempest> maybe a heal and and a blue heal is worth
[2023-01-04 11:26:11] <%+LiquidSword11> wolfs are too good for this, use the squirting

[2023-01-04 12:31:48] <+Ghaalskagg> Firegiant moves to much, a ranged or faster summon would be better i think
[2023-01-04 12:31:55] <%lazycoffee_bean> @lazycoffee_bean it has a 0.0016% modifier

[2023-01-04 12:32:41] <stridura> use imps
[2023-01-04 12:32:41] <+Phasmida> Not really
[2023-01-04 12:32:41] <%FelidaeSocialis> No she doesn't
[2023-01-04 12:32:45] <Kesirae> pepePutPhoneDown Why not use a summon that uses magic?
[2023-01-04 12:32:54] <%FelidaeSocialis> Latenna is super squishy tho
[2023-01-04 12:32:57] <atomicjest> imps do bleed
[2023-01-04 12:32:59] <%MadKingHyperion> what did you use for red wolf
[2023-01-04 12:33:04] <@%+ATONAT_> Imps are a basic version of vulgar militia
[2023-01-04 12:33:10] <Amarok457> i mean it doesn't matter if latenna can't move. if u can aggro fire giant and keep him close to latenna ez
[2023-01-04 12:33:14] <%mrpickles455> What about rollo?
[2023-01-04 12:33:14] <%arksteyx> Good morning
[2023-01-04 12:33:17] <+Phasmida> You could maybe position latenna on the cliff to the back right and then distract fire giant while she shoots?
[2023-01-04 12:33:18] <%Simbon> rot dogs?
[2023-01-04 12:33:20] <%sad_goblin_96> we need a titus summon to destroy fire giant
[2023-01-04 12:33:30] <%MantaRage> MadKingHyperion he used the rats
[2023-01-04 12:33:32] <Kesirae> Wait. What if you use the old reliable, the Jellyfish.
[2023-01-04 12:33:34] <@%+ATONAT_> Latenna phase 2 though? What about when fire giant teleports?
[2023-01-04 12:33:34] <calibancannibal> Skeletons have their own auto respawn so they could be good for long fights like this
[2023-01-04 12:33:40] <%rmorrin> good boys doing work

[2023-01-04 12:33:55] <@%+ATONAT_> @calibancannibal giant’s stomp will finish them while they reassemble though I think
[2023-01-04 12:34:13] <calibancannibal> Possibly
[2023-01-04 12:34:14] <Yurgin93> You should summon the leader of the wolve pack Lobos :)
[2023-01-04 12:34:46] <+Phasmida> @ATONAT_ If positioned right on the cliff near the top she should still be able to hit fire giant
[2023-01-04 12:34:53] <EdenDeezNuts> Can you double summon in seamless co op ?
[2023-01-04 12:35:04] <%lazycoffee_bean> would +10 make a difference
[2023-01-04 12:35:08] <Kesirae> I don't think he's grabbed Red Knight has he chat?

[2023-01-04 12:37:07] <calibancannibal> Warhawk or stormhawk have potential
[2023-01-04 12:37:12] <thekelvingreen> I seem to remember that you can summon Latenna outside the arena at the top of the hill and she can shoot from safety, but (1,) it's been ages so it may have been patched, and (2) it's very cheesy

[2023-01-04 13:38:23] <%alo_obert> @thedee88 why does Johnny have 10 apples? Is he hoarding them? speculating on the apple market?
[2023-01-04 13:38:25] <+wiwaka69> buff first 3 so ull have more time to summon others whule first not dying
[2023-01-04 13:38:25] <%+AlwayssSad> not as easy as you think

[2023-01-04 13:38:33] <$TheHarryManback> you say it like if using 4 OP rats was not trivial on other bosses
[2023-01-04 13:38:36] <chroetilda251> summon one until it dies and then summon another one

[2023-01-04 13:38:42] <%happyverii> they are doing better without you it seems

[2023-01-04 13:40:46] <%marrt00> is rot dog a trash summon if it's one of the few summons that can defeat fire giant?
[2023-01-04 13:40:59] <%FelidaeSocialis> Shruge Maybe it works with NPC summons. Try it?

[2023-01-04 13:41:35] <Stiffs8000> I think you can equip the shabriri talisman, call the spirit tear ash and unequip it so your spirit gets the agro mostly
[2023-01-04 13:41:36] <%hendrickson007> funny how blaid fights well with us but sucks with Radhan
[2023-01-04 13:41:45] <%FelidaeSocialis> @ATONAT_ I have done a summon only and I know
[2023-01-04 13:41:58] <+Tunercio_Ribagorda> and Blaidd is the best...

[2023-01-04 13:42:06] <@%+ATONAT_> Also Howl of Shabriri adds the effect too
[2023-01-04 13:42:24] <chroetilda251> shabriri’s woe only works in coop, doesnt affect spirit ashes
[2023-01-04 13:42:25] <%glacia7> also
[2023-01-04 13:42:32] <%shues> also you
[2023-01-04 13:42:36] <%Ixdex1> in my experience it only worked in coop, not with ashes

[2023-01-04 13:42:43] <scarti55ue> Also sugma

[2023-01-04 13:42:45] <%happyverii> also, you are able to resummon if theyd ie
[2023-01-04 13:42:56] <@%+ATONAT_> Personally no, I’m just basing it on anecdotal comments. No evidence against, some anecdotal for
[2023-01-04 13:43:00] <%+EvilEwok42> fextralife says they also work on ashes, and we all know fextralife is never wrong about anything lol
[2023-01-04 13:43:00] <LordSpankworthy> Draws aggro consistently
[2023-01-04 13:43:00] <ShogunSamuryan> chat has conlcuded there is no answer lol

[2023-01-04 13:44:20] <+Ghaalskagg> Shabriri works for sure,but the aggro is not permanent,every attack generates aggro from a summon or a player.I use it on mimic and it works.
[2023-01-04 13:44:23] <vysted> lobosOh
[2023-01-04 13:44:30] <%hemoclysm_> bull goat armor wil solve this

[2023-01-04 13:44:32] <@%+ATONAT_> Seems harder to prove it doesn’t work though? people saying they put it on and drew aggro quicker, others just say they didn’t notice a change. Also people saying it seems to stack with duelist set idk
[2023-01-04 13:44:40] <vysted> hes angie
[2023-01-04 13:44:41] <%why_damon> maybe shabiri's woe works with multiple mob type enemies
[2023-01-04 13:44:47] <$TheHarryManback> you get agro from him and theresa kills him by throwing pots
[2023-01-04 13:44:47] <@^StreamElements> PotFriend
[2023-01-04 13:44:54] <@%+ATONAT_> Because if you draw aggro and you’re further away he’ll follow you rather than aoeing up close?
[2023-01-04 13:44:56] <%+AlwayssSad> because casting spells generates emnity even if they're healing/buff spells
[2023-01-04 13:45:03] <scarti55ue> Also aggro from radahn seems silly to me
[2023-01-04 13:45:07] <@%^Nightbot> Follow the channel and make me the next pokimane
[2023-01-04 13:45:14] <%FelidaeSocialis> @Ghaalskagg It works on mimic yes. But not to pull aggro away from ash, not to ash
[2023-01-04 13:45:17] <scarti55ue> Cos aggro is better for also
[2023-01-04 13:45:20] <Stiffs8000> Imagine dying a horrible death against radahn just to be revived by a mf to be killed again by radahn
[2023-01-04 13:45:20] <%hemoclysm_> skill issue
[2023-01-04 13:45:21] <%Ixdex1> i mean, if you put on the talisman and then spam r1 all fight you're gonna take aggro regardless

[2023-01-04 13:46:39] <@%+ATONAT_> Kiting, ideally. Boss chases you instead of attacking summons
[2023-01-04 13:46:45] <scarti55ue> No he won’t blow you
[2023-01-04 13:46:56] <%+its_LDJ> Did you try resummoning?
[2023-01-04 13:46:59] <+Ghaalskagg> I mean the aggro switches between attackers,since ur not attacking it should work,but the summons attacking draw aggro too
[2023-01-04 13:47:00] <%+AlwayssSad> it wouldn't be 0 cause casting healing/buffs still generates aggro
[2023-01-04 13:47:00] <@%Vswed> skipping my advice WeirdDude
[2023-01-04 13:47:06] <scarti55ue> The boss is easy though bro
[2023-01-04 13:47:07] <$TheHarryManback> roll better LUL
[2023-01-04 13:47:10] <%+AlwayssSad> but I agree getting his aggro wouldn't help much
[2023-01-04 13:47:20] <@%+ATONAT_> I didn’t invent kiting KEKL
[2023-01-04 13:47:22] <%+seijuro13> "before you say something you have to think about it" ain have you met your chat

[2023-01-04 13:47:27] <%Ixdex1> yeah, but still not that much @AlwayssSad close enough for what i said :p

[2023-01-04 13:47:30] <%happyverii> leave horse alone
[2023-01-04 13:47:33] <scarti55ue> Why would you teach chat when you are the one dying
[2023-01-04 13:47:37] <itisnotaaron> i think it would honestly be better if you just resummon when they die
[2023-01-04 13:47:41] <$TheHarryManback> use Loretta's staff
[2023-01-04 13:47:48] <+Tunercio_Ribagorda> I think tah if you are riding the horse and lure it to attack you...it could avoid hits to the summonings

[2023-01-04 15:01:41] <$TheHarryManback> placi you can kill with the archer girl right?
[2023-01-04 15:01:41] <goldy_the_unbreakable> latenna is best against malenia and ogha is a massive hater for her and always knock her down
[2023-01-04 15:01:42] <@%+ATONAT_> Have you levelled up greatshield soldiers yet? They’re very highly regarded
[2023-01-04 15:02:01] <sukapha_ron> I remember watching a video where malenia fighting all the tier summons and still wins !!

[2023-01-04 15:02:24] <+Tunercio_Ribagorda> but it is good that the are small and fly...so they are not that easy to hit
