[2022-12-10 11:10:26] <%PotatoPCGamer2> ramattra is fun, i would say hes pretty balanced, they could buff his pull down a lil bit so it does what it does in the trailer

[2022-12-10 11:37:27] <jzkd2045> @DokOck53 yeah I think that the Zip rails play a big part in that because the map is about as bug as World's edge and if I'm correct, there are less POIs

[2022-12-10 15:17:46] <ElleKenway3> how do u ppl always get ads
[2022-12-10 15:17:50] <+NoxWright> I feel like Punch plays the adds when he is afk or not saying anything, I'm fine with that if that's the case
[2022-12-10 15:17:53] <Nagmz_> @pazers13 Use opera gx and just pull the stream out the corner
[2022-12-10 15:17:54] <+TheBoxTop> @pazers13 correcto
[2022-12-10 15:17:59] <IrZKuma> @pazers13 twitch works around the ad blockers fairly often then you need to wait for updates

[2022-12-10 15:43:57] <+NoxWright> I don't think Bastion's ult is like actualy... physical bullets. He just picks a spot on the floor and that spot explodes so I don't think roofs or blocking the air matter.

[2022-12-10 17:15:22] <%+Relex146> Rainbow Six Siege supports crossplay and cross-progression between PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and between PC, Stadia and Luna.  This means you can access your progress between either your PC, Stadia and Luna accounts, between consoles within the same family, or between PlayStation and Xbox consoles.
