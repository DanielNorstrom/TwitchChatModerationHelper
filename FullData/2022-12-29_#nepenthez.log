If you start a car wash, you can start pushing the money through the car wash in fake "business". That money, despite being taxed, is then yours to use with no questions asked.

[2022-12-29 14:47:38] <@%AaronBrookes94> @SpreadsheetFifa They were most likely waiting for a potential reason to ban him, and didn't he go through and sell tons of icons? Flagged as suspect and they hit him with the full ban due to his sponsorships

[2022-12-29 15:10:45] <jhunter123> Felix isn‚Äôt a striker imo
[2022-12-29 15:10:48] <+jameskelly23691> Wins a win
[2022-12-29 15:10:48] <%krk0707> should I keep prem bronze players
[2022-12-29 15:10:48] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @Viperlization Felix is a central player. More of a false 9 than an out and out striker. Gakpo is a winger.
[2022-12-29 15:10:49] <%+yaniek038> he didnt even press after the 80th minute
[2022-12-29 15:10:53] <%+brandonmcandrew78> Brilliant game management there Neppo

[2022-12-29 15:19:03] <%+danii6789> The bronze sud cards are 800-1.5k
[2022-12-29 15:19:06] <FreddieMehigs> people are rushing to buy them that's why @yingas12  and they aint 800 :D :D
[2022-12-29 15:19:06] <%+danii6789> maybe

[2022-12-29 15:19:31] <%ntblue1034> golds are cheap... silvers are expensive
[2022-12-29 15:19:32] <%+danii6789> on pc bronze suds were around 1k but silvers go for like 4k a piece here LUL
[2022-12-29 15:19:34] <botfrag100> nep can i do this with single player draft?
[2022-12-29 15:19:35] <yingas12> no i buy them for 800
[2022-12-29 15:19:36] <+SCF08onFIFA> Bronze and silver Sud's are 2k generally
[2022-12-29 15:19:39] <+tjyurieveaggy> @nepenthez is there going to be more tokens released
[2022-12-29 15:19:42] <yingas12> bought like 5 for 800
[2022-12-29 15:19:43] <+teasyy_tom> plus 1 time u will hit big

[2022-12-29 15:19:59] <%+danii6789> @NepentheZ there is a high chance that you get a bad loan pack if you go out of the draft in the first round
[2022-12-29 15:20:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Mate, weve made it
[2022-12-29 15:20:05] <%+danii6789> so going out second round is better
[2022-12-29 15:20:05] <@%$ItsTr3ple> I reckon 1st round exit is better than 2nd, hopefully no rares in the 5K packs
[2022-12-29 15:20:08] <johnterryspants> Thanks for listing them at 800 though mate you‚Äôve helped me complete the lib/sub easily üòâ
[2022-12-29 15:20:10] <%+joshua12012000> But look at the silvers that‚Äôs how the money neps making

[2022-12-29 15:20:14] <%krk0707> would opening silver packs be profitable aswell
[2022-12-29 15:20:14] <ifbbsami> Selling it under the Price

[2022-12-29 15:20:23] <iGrobby> i feel like its so good cuz theres literally no downside and you get to try new players
[2022-12-29 15:20:23] <kdw19> and wins for the winter winning obj are nice
[2022-12-29 15:20:28] <botfrag100> single player draft works too?

[2022-12-29 15:20:30] <Mr_Arneg> better to lose in the 1st round than win the draft when you get the 7.5k + two 25k packs
[2022-12-29 15:20:32] <+ASR20002001> so is the point to make it as far as possible or is it best to back out after first win?
[2022-12-29 15:20:40] <bluenosekiller007> noooo
[2022-12-29 15:20:43] <LiddleLockdown> i lost in the first round and got chong

[2022-12-29 15:50:42] <michaejss> In a way Draft is fun but why play it? Rewards not worth it & you have to be pretty lucky to get anything good out of it. Draft needs a revamp and fifa needs new game modes or just like promos new things.

[2022-12-29 15:50:57] <+Juckeeh> @NepentheZ business law student here, judges wouldn't care and if they did, EA settles in closed court. There's been numerous lawsuits about FIFA that haven't really surfaced onto social media, but EA is factually breaking the law. Quite an interesting article I read about Star Wars online a few weeks ago, that basically went into the legal aspect of scamming people ingame

[2022-12-29 15:51:12] <jake123playz> without addressing it further is false information. The offence is a strict liability offence. This means it does not need to be proven that the provider knew it had supplied false or misleading information. Providers can offer a defence if they can show they have taken all reasonable steps to ensure the information was correct. the fact it hasnt been updated proves they are in the wrong.

[2022-12-29 15:58:00] <$SteIngham> Have the rewards for offline changed since FIFA 16? just read an old article from a non EA site that details rewards in fifa 16 and it says that 0 wins offline gets you a gold pack.

[2022-12-29 15:59:04] <satvikkkk> they should do 1 of 2 TOTW player picks as permanent draft rewards that scale up to 1 of 3 and maybe 1 of 4. that way theoretically u get ur coin value back coz discarding it is 10k xqcT

[2022-12-29 16:06:08] <%ntblue1034> maybe it was if you had the points to qualify when last season ended

[2022-12-29 16:06:19] <@%$ItsTr3ple> That's at least 15/20 games to get the points
[2022-12-29 16:06:20] <@%AaronBrookes94> Could it have maybe not given you the points because you were on 0 points? So it bugged out thinking you'd already qualified?
[2022-12-29 16:06:21] <+shawchris9> Why have they removed subscribe  on twitch on the ps5?

[2022-12-29 16:06:33] <%+pokerbrat111> could be a long grind

[2022-12-29 16:45:16] <EasyGriezy> i dont watch much fifa content anymore because no one goes for high rank in champs. For me personally its not so entertaining grinding a massive team to stop at 11-1 in champs
[2022-12-29 16:45:24] <+Craig951> ive just helped my son (hes 7, so ive got to do online stuff :D) and hes got a good team very quickly with a limited grind

[2022-12-29 16:46:47] <+Od1ng> Stoichkov has to be the worst icon ive ever played with
[2022-12-29 16:46:59] <Gleesanator> The thing about the RTG was it‚Äôs also a place where we can just hear you talk about things, for me it became a thing of what‚Äôs Nep up to as opposed to how his RTG is going, be cool to see that come back
[2022-12-29 16:47:01] <Triplechins45> 20-0 rewards aren't even massively better
[2022-12-29 16:47:16] <EasyGriezy> yeah i understand it 100% its not the content creators fault, its the game. I preferred the 30 game format with top 100

[2022-12-29 17:34:30] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> That would be brilliant
[2022-12-29 17:34:36] <whufcconnor> u21 common would be so good for me
[2022-12-29 17:35:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Nah I think people are misreading the common thing. It was a way to give people super high scoring commons so that when they come into the main game they can have a proper go at getting limiteds in the academy.
[2022-12-29 17:35:02] <+GeorgeCuz> im begging they make more common divs, ive only played common for the last year so 95% of rewards are kinda useless atm
[2022-12-29 17:35:11] <colbydavis291018> Will you do SharePlay if anything comes out
[2022-12-29 17:35:37] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> @GeorgeCuz Same here
[2022-12-29 17:35:46] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Also common has always been about picking the best 5 not just having the best 5.

[2022-12-29 17:54:16] <+mozzaonstix> bc with discards, selling everything, at most u can only lose a couple k if u gert a run through for less than 20k consistently, which i do

[2022-12-29 17:55:02] <+euan18m> I've found the premium to be easy to rinse, the sud/lib squad usually costs like 5k and about 10k for ligue 1
[2022-12-29 17:55:26] <+jrossino> Top 2 segments are free every run
[2022-12-29 17:55:27] <+plantedwharf545> @euan18m What team is best for ligue 1?
[2022-12-29 17:55:45] <+mozzaonstix> i have like 5 clubs i look through for ligue 1 / ere and get that done on avg for about 9.5k-13k. then lib for about 6.5k. and the main 2 for at MOST 2k each
[2022-12-29 17:55:48] <+mattlorenzo_> I usually try getting the silver libs/suds on bid
[2022-12-29 17:55:53] <fifa22surviver> can I get your thoughts on the jarzinho sbc?
[2022-12-29 17:55:54] <+kev89preece> Psg is 16k as standard, mass bid on the lib cards and you‚Äôll get 5/15 cards you bud on for an average of 750 coins.
[2022-12-29 17:55:54] <+jrossino> Personally I don‚Äôt sell much all other cards go into PP

[2022-12-29 17:56:09] <+rokerjoker_> Some weird eggs around today
[2022-12-29 17:56:12] <+giuseppe_esq> I need fodder for SBCs and pulled untradeable Neymar.
[2022-12-29 17:56:15] <%+RfcHarry07> @blakechurch12 pu into upgrades then put into league sbcs open tradeable packs and just keep opening bronze packs
[2022-12-29 17:56:16] <AlyoshaFyodorovitch> do you remember the fifa 12 pro clubs series with skillz and jj? it was hilarious af. my favorite fifa series
[2022-12-29 17:56:21] <VictorPogba93> Hey nep how u doing man
[2022-12-29 17:56:24] <+euan18m> @plantedwharf545 I typically go for what i have most players in. Nantes has been a staple for me recently tho. Common golds are cheap and theres a fair amount
[2022-12-29 17:56:25] <$yayatoure12399> i do each run 20k and just reusing the players i get back from the ppacks
[2022-12-29 17:56:41] <%+Mrdyslexia4> 50
[2022-12-29 17:56:41] <%$liamfifa91> @blakechurch12 plus when you‚Äôre putting the fodder into other SBC‚Äôs you‚Äôre also getting tradable packs back
[2022-12-29 17:56:41] <+rokerjoker_> I respect the grind
[2022-12-29 17:56:42] <$yayatoure12399> yes exactly
[2022-12-29 17:56:44] <1870s> I literally made 6.5k profit from 1 bronze back jesus i love it
[2022-12-29 17:56:47] <%$istreet98> I've done it over 20 times and only got 1 86 walkout tradeable. Lost over 100k
[2022-12-29 17:56:49] <+mozzaonstix> with the ere/ligue 1 i look through my 5 diff clubs i use. look at the expensive cards from the cheapest clubs to see which ones cheapest at that time
[2022-12-29 17:56:54] <%+shamefulJoey53> I've been grinding it but starting to run out of bundes / serie a / la liga / prem players
[2022-12-29 17:57:02] <+jrossino> There‚Äôs always potential you hit something big from the jumbo gold and everything is relayed
[2022-12-29 17:57:06] <+jrossino> Repayed
[2022-12-29 17:57:18] <+plantedwharf545> @euan18m Yh thats what i am doing as i grind bpm and upgrades, the teams seem to be similar prices if you‚Äôre sensible
[2022-12-29 17:57:26] <+blazeshadowdark> I‚Äôve been doing bpm for a few days. Made 120k so far! It‚Äôs a great time for the moment!!
[2022-12-29 17:57:37] <+jrossino> They really kept league sbc from us so we couldn‚Äôt stack fodder cos it was rare to get without league sbc
[2022-12-29 17:57:50] <%+RfcHarry07> i have dupes cant even open rivals rewards cos ive done all players i want to do
[2022-12-29 17:57:52] <92ish562> The BPM = free PPs
[2022-12-29 17:57:55] <$jose_1245> Hello Nep
[2022-12-29 17:57:55] VIEWERS: 2¬†000
[2022-12-29 17:57:58] <+kev89preece> I‚Äôm up to 92 packs (prime and small rare) and down around 140k. It‚Äôs not a bad trade off
[2022-12-29 17:58:01] <islander771231> i did 8 of the 9 teams of zairzinho without spending a single coin to buy and still have a lot of fodder
[2022-12-29 17:58:04] <here4rewards_> I have done each sbc around 10 or more times, packed and crafted 14+ Winter wildcards
[2022-12-29 17:58:05] <%$liamfifa91> I‚Äôve done the premium one at least 40/50 times and I‚Äôm up with coins and club is stacked. I find it hard to believe with the jumbo gold and the small prime being tradable that people are down so much
[2022-12-29 17:58:07] <+kingnothing_x7> what's the best team to use for the lib or sud one club SBC
[2022-12-29 17:58:08] <+jrossino> You boys recommend doing jair or wait for gamble sbc?
[2022-12-29 17:58:09] <%$istreet98> 2 86 untradeable and 87 chielleni
[2022-12-29 17:58:09] <vvvjonesyvvv> people love to exaggerate on FIFA, it's always somewhere in the middle
[2022-12-29 17:58:13] <+euan18m> @plantedwharf545 BPM is good for starting off but I feel like once you have a solid club of golds its typically not the best use of time
[2022-12-29 17:58:15] <$yayatoure12399> with this methood, I have got lucky a few times  and packed a few special cards and fodder that sell for alot, it basically made a lot of the coins back
[2022-12-29 17:58:16] <dizzydukc> i always save all my cards for sbc i did the lueagr sbc sold@my neymar and after i finished it i got  mendy ww and lisandro martinez so it was worth it
[2022-12-29 17:58:27] <+rokerjoker_> I have been through 7 or 8 times and havent packed anything major but have put lots of cards into the club and do it efficiently price wise
[2022-12-29 17:58:34] <+danboyle156> What team do you think is the best for the ligue 1/eredivisie squad?
[2022-12-29 17:58:39] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> lower division players are the most toxic on the game i swear
[2022-12-29 17:58:45] <johnterryspants> Is this the same playlist as yesterday Nep?
[2022-12-29 17:58:46] <xjo0ey> Are u content creator or a pro
[2022-12-29 17:58:50] <+T___Train> I completed Kroos and Payed with untradable dupes..

[2022-12-29 17:59:00] <%+MonstaReqs> I've done it 15 times I've completed kroos and the hero sbc because of it
[2022-12-29 17:59:03] <johnterryspants> @xjo0ey God
[2022-12-29 17:59:05] <+prohit97> How is that gavi tott?
[2022-12-29 17:59:07] <%+ColeTrain3> iv broke even but done 5 segments or Jairzinho
[2022-12-29 17:59:09] <Jalebigill> @danboyle156 I done psg it‚Äôs actually not terrible to pay for players
[2022-12-29 17:59:12] <%+tobywankenobi101> I'be done it about 15 times and only lost about 50k but put loads of fodder into the club so
[2022-12-29 17:59:13] <dizzydukc> pro streamer tho
[2022-12-29 17:59:17] <Beanomm> i've done it sooo many times, it's just so enjoyable
[2022-12-29 17:59:19] <%cornishgirth> BPM makes it cheap. People just can‚Äôt be bothered to sit there opening them lol
[2022-12-29 17:59:20] <%+bazzay10> yeah I've got nothing special but used fodder to get hero pack and got Di natale
[2022-12-29 17:59:24] <+danboyle156> Do you know the best squad to use for the one club segment?
[2022-12-29 17:59:27] <%+shamefulJoey53> What do you sell from the tradable packs?
[2022-12-29 17:59:28] <+plantedwharf545> @euan18m Yh, it‚Äôs been good for the other league sbc with the silver upgrades, will experiment with just coining through it after my last non-premium run
[2022-12-29 17:59:33] <%$max_kingsley> Im already 500k down with the League SBC. I only sell the Ligue 1 Players that I don‚Äôt use. Everything else I put into 75+ or Jairzinho. But with 500k down I already done the Premium League at least 25-30 times.
[2022-12-29 17:59:33] <+Jimmer_42> only sad part about jairzinho sbc is thtat i was looking forward to using his prime end game but i probs wont now

[2022-12-29 17:59:39] <+rokerjoker_> I dont use BPM towards it

[2022-12-29 18:00:24] <%+Dilly_666> with bpm into gold and silvers I can do premium sbc for 7-8k v efficient

[2022-12-29 18:02:08] <%$max_kingsley> I actually use everything in all the SBCs. I haven‚Äôt discarded a single player but also sell almost nothing. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm down 500k. I still have 3,6 Mio, that‚Äôs why I put even tradable Players in the 75+ Picks.
[2022-12-29 18:02:18] <+aoe2hostage> which is better, the premium or non-premium?
[2022-12-29 18:02:21] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> no money spent @M0EH1
[2022-12-29 18:02:24] <+rokerjoker_> I have a simple method. I use the same Eredivisie club and the same group of Lib players. Their prices fluctuate so I just wait for a down cycle and buy 2 to 3 of each. You have to be patient

[2022-12-29 18:05:47] <%$max_kingsley> I would love a Speedrun or something like that for just the League SBCs. Start with 50k/100k and see what happens. Maybe the next step with the 4 Hour RTG?

[2022-12-29 18:54:20] <ry1up> They could well be stream snipers but I think it‚Äôs also down to being dropped two divisions as I don‚Äôt play much rivals I usually get to around div 4-3 then put back to div 6-5
[2022-12-29 18:54:20] <erikdinho3> It always happens when u really need it aswell @mykill91

[2022-12-29 18:54:32] <%eatburgers1> I am not saying you're wrong about snipers, but you can get a few good players in lower divisions, like someone who used to play and got it for christmas, or me personally who was in div 6 yesterday because I hadn't played much rivals for a few weeks. On average there will be the odd good player down there. But maybe you are getting proportionately more than normal

[2022-12-29 19:29:29] <%+ray_rockwood> @3omar_astro it.wouldnt be op though. It would make unusable cards worth using if you could raise their composure or stamina
[2022-12-29 19:29:33] <iiCal_v1> Marquee matchups actually feels decently profitable with the inflated cards from league sbcs
