[2022-12-07 17:46:35] <%+TankeGames> What if they made PvP leaderboards with each season? Think that would help incentivize people to keep playing it?
[2022-12-07 17:46:40] <%lG9R> yeah, lot's of lightning and lots of water
[2022-12-07 17:46:46] <%savvy905> @orbponderer14 I saw you in here the other day! It’s been a while

[2022-12-07 17:47:49] <hbforever1> To be honest I really hated the last PVP but the way they are doing it now is 100x better and fair.
[2022-12-07 17:47:59] <@%+Raeeyore> huh.... weird
[2022-12-07 17:48:04] <%0steri> is it wrong to take beer if vacation? :D

[2022-12-07 17:48:29] <seadogg_468> lets goo
[2022-12-07 17:48:38] <%+Josverhallen> wasnt the vent meant for the heat dissipation
[2022-12-07 17:48:41] <$UltimaPowers> shows a bit too much favouritism, yknow
[2022-12-07 17:48:50] <%+Josverhallen> during those very hot summers
[2022-12-07 17:48:57] <%0steri> @UltimaPowers no wife :D just alone
[2022-12-07 17:49:13] <$UltimaPowers> ahh well no bother leaving her behind then
[2022-12-07 17:49:15] <%+DoobyUK> Aircons are literally heat pumps, they are basically the same thing
[2022-12-07 17:49:24] <@%agitatedsquid> an actual  in-game war and still not a single war cry
[2022-12-07 17:49:28] <%+Josverhallen> disgusting
[2022-12-07 17:49:30] <steelslickrick> It reverses the gas from the out side coils to the inside coils
[2022-12-07 17:49:32] <Stekieee> gg bois pack it up
[2022-12-07 17:49:33] <%+DoobyUK> its just which direction you pump the gas round

[2022-12-07 17:50:28] <%+DoobyUK> always annoys me when 'AirConn' is baaad and 'Heat Pump' is nice and green - literally the same fucking thing
[2022-12-07 17:50:38] <%TimPdotTM> AC
[2022-12-07 17:50:41] <%infectixn> I think the momemnt you are in the water merms should appear so people wouldnt get screwd
[2022-12-07 17:50:41] <+BigJohnsonTV> i have not lol
[2022-12-07 17:50:57] <$The_Great_Rafiki> worse merm I had this season... spawned... behind me... as I was swimming away
[2022-12-07 17:51:00] <@%+Raeeyore> you can't chainshot but you can firework... remember
[2022-12-07 17:51:06] <@%agitatedsquid> might be controversial but i also think the solo respawn times are too faster for a solo v solo fight
[2022-12-07 17:51:09] <$UltimaPowers> you used to be able to poop your own deck too
[2022-12-07 17:51:09] <@%^Nightbot> Fancy yourself a hat or a T-shirt? 🧢  Check out Beard's merch shop here: https://www.shopbeardageddon.com
[2022-12-07 17:51:13] <Digmybeak> Why would you want to chainshot your own mast?
[2022-12-07 17:51:15] <$UltimaPowers> Rare pls fix
[2022-12-07 17:51:23] <%$Dieks77> @DoobyUK well, aircons are usually more optimized for the cooling and heatpumps for the heating. but essentially they are the exact same thing yeah
[2022-12-07 17:51:36] <%+Crom_11> Yesterday I got blundered off then chainshotted, it took me so long to swim after the ship as it slowed
[2022-12-07 17:51:42] <%DoozyDomo> @agitatedsquid nah I can agree to that. an extra 3 to 5 seconds would be better
[2022-12-07 17:51:42] <Digmybeak> Ohhhh that makes sense
[2022-12-07 17:51:50] <$UltimaPowers> i did it to my own boat once to hide it behind reaper's
[2022-12-07 17:51:59] <$UltimaPowers> whilst waiting on a golden reaper chest to arrive
[2022-12-07 17:52:03] <%TimPdotTM> @ultimapowers was that you?
[2022-12-07 17:52:07] <$UltimaPowers> worked a treat
[2022-12-07 17:52:19] <$UltimaPowers> was what me?
[2022-12-07 17:52:34] <%TimPdotTM> @ultimapowers had someone do that to my crew once.
[2022-12-07 17:52:40] <$UltimaPowers> do what

[2022-12-07 17:54:26] <Lobalw> that's like 10 more sinks to 100
[2022-12-07 17:54:28] <$UltimaPowers> oh well maybe then... it was a while ago now, back when it was still nice weather at reaper's @TimPdotTM
[2022-12-07 17:54:28] <%SweatBait> its coming today, few more wins
[2022-12-07 17:54:31] <%infectixn> 6 sinks should get you to 100
[2022-12-07 17:54:35] <%DrnkenMaster> flag?
[2022-12-07 17:54:41] <$UltimaPowers> and people still cared about gold reaper chests
[2022-12-07 17:54:41] <%LogsCreations> watching you is giving me a break from finals week
[2022-12-07 17:54:44] <%lG9R> what do you think about the resource situation, do you think they should implement something to fill resources after a fight?
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <+oxporiv> Beard if you keep this up you’re gonna get the blessing today!
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <+darthmiserius> seas are getting more dangerous all te casuals have taken it up a notch post update

[2022-12-07 17:55:24] <jens_buur> Why tf are u underwater HUH
[2022-12-07 17:55:37] <@%agitatedsquid> that's a dumb solution anyway
[2022-12-07 17:55:41] <@%agitatedsquid> just give people more starting supplies
[2022-12-07 17:55:51] <Lewjaaa> hello!
[2022-12-07 17:55:52] <%+OrbPonderer14> people would never exploit something like that Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:55:52] <%AYRlS> what about getting supllies after dipping under water to join new server
[2022-12-07 17:55:53] <+cwgraham85> They should change how much supply you respawn with if you sink from the battle mode.
[2022-12-07 17:55:59] <%+Josverhallen> This boat has been upgraded to a submaring

[2022-12-07 17:56:05] <%+andysig> ive had a awesome day on adventure today
[2022-12-07 17:56:09] <%+DoobyUK> if everyone has more stat supplies it changes nothing, the person who stocks up still has more than you
[2022-12-07 17:56:27] <%not_blade01> pineapple in bottom barrel
[2022-12-07 17:56:35] <%$SLaMDannigan> Just lift the cap on the supply vendors? and take throwables and chains out of them?
[2022-12-07 17:56:36] <%5YBREN> I never minded the supplying up in the new mode yet. It's so easy now to get supplies compared to two years ago.
[2022-12-07 17:56:37] <+MissRarity_> Maybe more supplies for fresh spawns but lower resupply for respawns?
[2022-12-07 17:56:39] <%+Josverhallen> i feel like if you sank you lose all your supplies
[2022-12-07 17:56:46] <%Count_Buttcrackula> id be cool with like 10 more cannon balls added and lik 10 or so coconuts in base supplies. doesnt seems like it'd break it too awfully much
[2022-12-07 17:56:47] <%Malice5578> Sup beard, how close are we to the curse now?
[2022-12-07 17:56:49] <%+Josverhallen> boat be empty
[2022-12-07 17:56:59] <FryskeSergeant> why not make it like when you dive down there is a supply ship where you can buy supplies underwater before entering the fight
[2022-12-07 17:56:59] <%Malice5578> nice
[2022-12-07 17:57:02] <oreomaster_sot> Hey, how are you today
[2022-12-07 17:57:03] <오만원과편견 (elicious53)> 겁나 고였네.. 개잘한다
[2022-12-07 17:57:04] <%$path_smalls> if they could somehow implement the auto despawning in adventure after you sink someone 3 times or something, but may be too complicated
[2022-12-07 17:57:09] <%sithsaucey> @FryskeSergeant this
[2022-12-07 17:57:09] <%+Josverhallen> !english
[2022-12-07 17:57:11] <%lG9R> barrels of suplies floating after you sink a ship? @Beardageddon
[2022-12-07 17:57:11] <DanBOriginal> what ship cosmetics are those??
[2022-12-07 17:57:24] <$UltimaPowers> i think a sunk ship should float up 50% of it's supplies in a crate no matter the context; PvP mode or adventure
[2022-12-07 17:57:25] <FearlessJake> Could they not just make it so that you get like 30 extra cannonballs during the pvp fight, when ended they disappear?
[2022-12-07 17:57:25] <+monferno> sea forts give 150 cannonballs if not looted
[2022-12-07 17:57:27] <seadogg_468> you are the partner of sot and still you're complaining huh?

[2022-12-07 17:57:31] <oreomaster_sot> Im good and you
[2022-12-07 17:57:32] <FryskeSergeant> you have a 30 sec timer before fight starts
[2022-12-07 17:57:32] <iSmiter> If anything they should just drop peoples barrels after you sink them
[2022-12-07 17:57:32] <%DoozyDomo> I'm gonna have to go to work soon, so I think I'm gonna miss you hitting 100 live. legcRipz gonna try to tune in periodically
[2022-12-07 17:57:41] <+SquatterMadras> Good day Dax - hope you are well :)
[2022-12-07 17:57:43] <+hollowman113> Whatever it takes to get people back into the fight sooner! It not about the gold it’s about the glory!
[2022-12-07 17:57:47] <Ephious> Well night yall
[2022-12-07 17:57:52] <$Ka_Wouter> It's literally PVP in adventure, complains about supplies, alliances and blunderbombs make absolutely no sense. It wasn't an issue before. Nothing has changes, you just get PVP faster.
[2022-12-07 17:58:02] <seadogg_468> yeah yeah i was just joking
[2022-12-07 17:58:04] <@%agitatedsquid> sorry that was my alt account Kappa

[2022-12-07 17:58:34] <%+Crom_11> More battle barrels! With even more kegs!
[2022-12-07 17:58:36] <+Themanobo> barrels you can harpoon in the underwater vaze
[2022-12-07 17:58:36] <%$SLaMDannigan> So here's ma solution... All supplies on a boat should float up after being sank... Done!
[2022-12-07 17:58:39] <MrSaltyTheNF> that's most guys
[2022-12-07 17:58:40] <$The_Great_Rafiki> was this the salty boy?
[2022-12-07 17:58:41] <%DoozyDomo> sounds like he already went for one
[2022-12-07 17:58:43] <cashincreases> you should be able to get all the supplies off enemy boats you beat in this mode i think
[2022-12-07 17:58:58] <+ThePretendUK> Barrels should fill to a certain level when in battle, and then revert to your pre-battle levels.
[2022-12-07 17:59:10] <+ThePretendUK> Once the battle is over
[2022-12-07 17:59:17] <$Ka_Wouter> @SLaMDannigan better solution, everything stays the same because it's still adventure
[2022-12-07 17:59:21] <johnny8egood25> maybe there coulde be a way to do so underwater... Like you get a supp crate or whatever
[2022-12-07 17:59:21] <AntiLCF> good evening o/

[2022-12-07 18:00:10] <+BigJohnsonTV> rare needs to address cheaters first
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <Ill_ser3nity_llI> Additional supplies for the PVP mode could work if they were to implement it at the point of the 'battle begins' banner. So as soon as you get matched you get given Arena supplies or something, which then get taken away at the end of the battle and you're left with only what you queued up with.
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <@%agitatedsquid> wait so now you're arguing against your own argument of people dropping supplies? LUL
[2022-12-07 18:00:18] <%DoozyDomo> @johnny8egood25 yo I was just thinking about this

[2022-12-07 18:00:29] <mbapp_eh> That’s why people shouldn’t complain about supplies and see that taking time to get them is part of the game
[2022-12-07 18:00:32] <+cwgraham85> Make your supplies dependent on what mode you sink in. Sink in normal adventure respawn with normal supplies. Sink during the battle mode and respawn with more supplies.
[2022-12-07 18:00:37] <Chet_Awesomelazor> Change your barrels to Arena barrels when you spawn in and revert back when you win/sink
[2022-12-07 18:00:39] <%lG9R> going around the zone to try and board you and lead your ship away from the zone?
[2022-12-07 18:00:41] <AntiLCF> he's like f*ck that shit im out :D
[2022-12-07 18:00:41] <+hollowman113> Supplies like loot should be available when a ship sinks, but the amount of supplies you can save needs to have a limit
[2022-12-07 18:00:48] <@%agitatedsquid> oh yeah like i said earlier just get rid of them Kappa
[2022-12-07 18:00:53] <%$SLaMDannigan> He's gonna blow up!
[2022-12-07 18:00:53] <%+Bunny_VIB> He saw Ainsley and bailed haha
[2022-12-07 18:00:54] <CaptainAegnor> so he gave up?
[2022-12-07 18:00:55] <%+Crom_11> So when you dive, you get extra supplies but only up to a certain level
[2022-12-07 18:00:56] <seadogg_468> he's going out?
[2022-12-07 18:00:56] <trickytwitch_> is he sailing out of map bounds?
[2022-12-07 18:00:58] <+IsntEvenMyFinalForm> lets see if this strategy pays off for him
[2022-12-07 18:01:02] <mrbojangley> Could they implement something similar to the  plunder pass  where you unlock stuff only by playing this mode
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <$The_Great_Rafiki> is man is out of here?
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%+CaseyJones77> saw it was the Ainsley Harriott and went running
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <johnny8egood25> @DoozyDomo yeah nad also implement a win to lose ratio to it so waht beard said wouldnt happen

[2022-12-07 18:01:43] <+hollowman113> What’s the point? He gets no rep
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <c0pe0ne> he prob has 0 naval skill, just trying to board and sail you out of bounds LUL
[2022-12-07 18:01:45] <CaptainAegnor> Eheh! Streak 3!
[2022-12-07 18:01:47] <kronikhaze240> Are you going to turn in to get the rep?
[2022-12-07 18:01:48] <%DoozyDomo> @johnny8egood25 or just have it be cannons, wood, and food
[2022-12-07 18:01:50] <%$path_smalls> Limiting the amount of chains and specials like arena would be great, forces players to strategize rather than spam
[2022-12-07 18:01:50] <Ironside8516> i need more opponents like him
[2022-12-07 18:01:51] <@%agitatedsquid> you just need the next person to scuttle and you've got an equal amount of wins and gifted wins

[2022-12-07 18:02:06] <iAmGoatFather> What about guaranteed bird barrels when you respawn after losing a fight?
[2022-12-07 18:02:08] <%+OrbPonderer14> that one's going in the 'tage legcRage
[2022-12-07 18:02:09] <%lG9R> @Beardageddon how many hours do you usualy stream?
[2022-12-07 18:02:10] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> I agree that we shouldn't get supply after a fight; we have to go look for some if we need it; like we always had and still have to do
[2022-12-07 18:02:12] <seadogg_468> he's scared now
[2022-12-07 18:02:18] <CaptainAegnor> Beard going for the streak 4? Pog?
[2022-12-07 18:02:18] <%+DoobyUK> he does get rep for losing

[2022-12-07 18:02:25] <+jesusonaunicorn> sell
[2022-12-07 18:02:29] <johnny8egood25> @DoozyDomo maybe idk
[2022-12-07 18:02:33] <%+CheeseburgerXApocalypse> maybe each fight should strip your pockets and barrels and start you with a set number of supplies
[2022-12-07 18:02:42] <c0pe0ne> @doobyuk no he doesnt, he went out of bounds
[2022-12-07 18:02:44] <+jesusonaunicorn> streak of two
[2022-12-07 18:02:47] <+chief863> What if there was the option to requeue after sinking and you keep the supplies you had on your ship if you opt into it? If you back out of the queue from that point you lose the supplies
[2022-12-07 18:02:51] <rojozombie> what did you do before gaming?
[2022-12-07 18:02:57] <%$Wahosken> long stream beard > 2 short boys
[2022-12-07 18:03:03] <%DoozyDomo> @johnny8egood25 maybe just when at a zero streak? so only before the first fight or after a loss?
[2022-12-07 18:03:08] <%+DoobyUK> I thought you still got rep unless you scuttle @c0pe0ne
[2022-12-07 18:03:09] <seadogg_468> did you see that level 100 athena curse cutscene?
[2022-12-07 18:03:12] <%WackDaniells> Have you run into a good number of throwers?

[2022-12-07 18:04:28] <nice_vibe> how long do you put them in for?

[2022-12-07 18:04:39] <Ironside8516> we just use the dryer
[2022-12-07 18:04:44] <@%agitatedsquid> if your junk is cold maybe you should keep it in your pants in the first place
[2022-12-07 18:04:46] <%bigbadbootydaddy86> can confirm it's a legit strategy

[2022-12-07 18:04:57] <%DoozyDomo> @johnny8egood25 if they are good enough to sink everyone, they should start siphoning
[2022-12-07 18:04:58] <$TheTechnicolorDreamGoat> really unlocks the flavors
[2022-12-07 18:04:58] <bizrgamr> dont season your microwave LUL

[2022-12-07 18:05:06] <%5YBREN> Bruh imagine Beard standing bottomless in the kitchen looking through the microwave window
[2022-12-07 18:05:08] <@%+DJPhoenixUK> clean underwear? you mean i have to buy new stuff every time i want to microwave it?
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <nice_vibe> do you at least season them first?
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <%+machine_washcold> wait...ya'll wear underwear?

[2022-12-07 18:05:25] <bigpermy> i dont wear underwear  so i guess I'll just microwave my junk and see if it warms me up
[2022-12-07 18:05:27] <Dolfgrim> there's a reason why there's so many warning labels everywhere.... just some people LUL
[2022-12-07 18:05:35] <+SquatterMadras> I'm surprised they even HAVE microwaves in Cornwall - they struggle with light switches down there ;)

[2022-12-07 18:07:42] <%DoozyDomo> @johnny8egood25 yeah but with 1v1s, respawns are so short siphoning can be difficult
[2022-12-07 18:07:46] <%RoyRed> @DJPhoenixUK ah yeah I think I remember that some odd years back.

[2022-12-07 18:10:53] <rojozombie> I think they should add whirlpools on the map that spawn.

[2022-12-07 18:11:12] <+hollowman113> Thoughts on this mode starting with even supplies on both sides like Arena?
[2022-12-07 18:11:15] <$KnottyPwetzel> I like running veils with hourglass active; two birds, one stone.

[2022-12-07 18:11:38] <%+andysig> i believe so
[2022-12-07 18:11:38] <%AveryCorvus> 'new social options for crews'
[2022-12-07 18:11:42] <%5YBREN> New Social Options for Crews
[2022-12-07 18:11:42] <@%+Raeeyore> @bunny_vib don't be sorry.... I'm still working so I can't do things as quick, you're helping me out
[2022-12-07 18:12:08] <@%^Nightbot> Beard is partnered with Sneak Energy! Use code THEHWAY in the checkout cart. Thank you for your support! https://sneakenergy.com/collections/deals
[2022-12-07 18:12:11] <%$path_smalls> That actually makes sense
[2022-12-07 18:12:15] <%$SLaMDannigan> Synced emotes can't be an entire update though... right? RIGHT?
[2022-12-07 18:12:15] <%+DoobyUK> it makes it too much like a separate game mode
[2022-12-07 18:12:15] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Raeeyore okies xx well I gotta go afk now to feed the kids so hopefully @DJPhoenixUK can pick up the slack? Kappa

[2022-12-07 18:12:39] <$KnottyPwetzel> @SLaMDannigan I mean...they did have a whole update for sitting?
[2022-12-07 18:12:40] <%$path_smalls> You've changed my mind Beard SeemsGood
[2022-12-07 18:12:51] <%5YBREN> 'Expanded role play & quest types' was the tagline for this season, seems really vague looking back at it lol
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <@%agitatedsquid> season 8s was "expanded role play" on the roadmap though so who knows what's actually happening Kappa
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <@%+Raeeyore> @bunny_vib ha ha ha good thing I'm finishing work soon LUL
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <%sbk548> im back beard
[2022-12-07 18:13:04] <%+therugby> this game man <3
[2022-12-07 18:13:06] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> Yeah, you never know if you gonna get against one ship or 3 ships alliance LUL
[2022-12-07 18:13:12] <%$SLaMDannigan> @SLaMDannigan LUL That was Sea forts! ...and stools
[2022-12-07 18:13:20] <CaptainAegnor> I think people who want the same supplies like Arena are just fed up with supplying up after every sink. Which I can understand...But depends on the ship type once again...
[2022-12-07 18:13:26] <+Design_Deity> I'd love a way to TDM within your own crew. This would help new/inexperienced crews to practice hand-tohand combat. Instead of getting killed the loser crew mate gets a long stun similar to missed lunge.
[2022-12-07 18:13:28] <Thisismeisityou> I feel like half the people didn't even know there were chests to dig up in Arena lol
[2022-12-07 18:13:44] <%SweatBait> oh can megs, skellies and kraken spawn INSIDE the barrier in pvp? i hope so tbh...doesnt get more dynamic than that
[2022-12-07 18:13:51] <ins0mnix> I like the ability to not have to get supplies, flip the thing over and dive.
[2022-12-07 18:13:53] <+chief863> I've yet to see an alliance or shores of gold exploiter, guess I'm just lucky
[2022-12-07 18:13:57] <@%agitatedsquid> because people see other ships and call it an alliance but what's actually happened is that two battles have just happened to spawn in the same area
[2022-12-07 18:13:57] <%5YBREN> The only thing I notice now online is players that are not very good at pvp would've benefited from the arena instant respawn after sink to jump back into fighting the same crews again and learning from it.
[2022-12-07 18:14:02] <%+Crom_11> We had an organic one as a duo sloop where a 3P brig joined in on their side. Was a really fun 20 minutes of constant planking and bucketing
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <johnny8egood25> @Beardageddon ok what if when you are underwater a supp crate or something spawns that is has some kind of win to lose ratio so evereyone is happy
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> I actually I haven't, but I did meet a crew that was camping a fortress and kegged us and use fortress cannons
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <%+DoobyUK> @Design_Deity maybe just let your whole crew start on the Maiden Voyage island and let you do stuff there
[2022-12-07 18:14:12] <+crispybacon5> I've been in 1 alliance fight. It was kinda crazy
[2022-12-07 18:14:12] <Taboo48> Ran into a shores of gold exploiter the other night. Have you ran into one of those yet?
[2022-12-07 18:14:12] <%sbk548> beard my niece is here in our hose today and when i saw her sleeping she started to cough shes a bit sick shes is only 6 months i feel so bad
[2022-12-07 18:14:13] <+Mutefire_yt> yee
[2022-12-07 18:14:20] <Stekieee> @Design_Deity There is no reason to not have friendly fire other than making open crew better
[2022-12-07 18:14:24] <%$RunTMc93> Happened to me my 4th game and 2 of my friends it was their first pvp on demand fight. 3 allianced boats Vs us
[2022-12-07 18:14:31] <%$SLaMDannigan> I burst out on a Athena ship the otherday, and a champion flame heart bpat (like mine) burst out halfway through... Get double spawned on!
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] [Notification] salamandich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! [poopfart 69 420]
[2022-12-07 18:14:52] <+Design_Deity> @DoobyUK That or, if you're sailing a long distnace, and you want to kill time then you can have a quick battle aboard the ship.
[2022-12-07 18:15:07] <seadogg_468> you mean you can alliance with another ship and do pvp?
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> I was in an alliance in this mode in defense but we told our mates we wouldn't interfere
[2022-12-07 18:15:13] <%+Exeian> PVE servers in season 9?!? Player base would expand 5X

[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <+cmdrdean> I have not ran into aliances per-say, but I have had a few third parties come in in the middle of a fight
[2022-12-07 18:15:49] <c0pe0ne> it would f*ck the whole game
[2022-12-07 18:15:49] <$KnottyPwetzel> @Exeian lol for like 2 weeks until they all got bored because of no player interaction.
