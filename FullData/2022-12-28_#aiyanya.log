[2022-12-28 10:32:50] <%MatthewScammell> Whenever I hear people talking about the Avatar movie my mind goes straight to the live action Avatar: The last Air Bender movie and I die a bit inside remembering that movie exists.
[2022-12-28 10:32:55] <%unstablekaren> 3D was a terrible idea because no one actually knew how to use it properly. or at least very few. avatar was the first true movie made for 3D specifically
[2022-12-28 10:33:16] <Dang_old_Dixie> 3D was cool in concept but just didn't work in practice. We tried it and all went 'nahhh'

[2022-12-28 10:56:03] <Dragamyr> we had a cow's eyeball at highschool. I missed the frogs day.
[2022-12-28 10:56:05] <@%Dark_Fable> and then we did a cockroach and bleh

[2022-12-28 11:30:03] <!%+Edrem> minecraft was in alpha/beta for ages

[2022-12-28 11:30:22] <!%AzureAhmed> Minecraft
[2022-12-28 11:30:23] <!%+Edrem> I actually bought it back when it was just some indie game on the tig forums
[2022-12-28 11:30:24] <+cmourttv> as I have over 2k hours in terraria I would pick that
[2022-12-28 11:30:29] <!%AzureAhmed> cuz that toxic strimer Aiya plays Terraria
[2022-12-28 11:30:33] <@%Dark_Fable> minecraft mostly for building itch. Terrarria is a better combat game
[2022-12-28 11:30:33] <Dang_old_Dixie> I think the minecraft alpha predates Terraria but Terraria got released sooner officially

[2022-12-28 14:47:25] <%DragonofEternity> wtf is that
[2022-12-28 14:47:45] <%DragonofEternity> is this vanilla? calamity?
[2022-12-28 14:47:56] <CraftyasFox> I hate how they portray cloud in other games like dissidea and kingdom hearts. They make him as emo as squall
