[2022-12-08 20:42:36] <%OnePunkArmy> The reveals are spaced out across the show, so we hope the pacing will feel good. There are lots of fun moments. We’ve also held back surprise presenters, performers and lots of games that aren’t pre announced.
[2022-12-08 20:42:55] <%OnePunkArmy> There are games revealing tonight I’ve been waiting to show you for years. We don’t make the games so we are only as good as what’s shipping and what’s ready to showcase. I do feel really good about this year’s lineup.
