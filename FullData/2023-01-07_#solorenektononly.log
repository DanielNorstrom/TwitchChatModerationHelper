[2023-01-07 18:49:50] <foreverrxx> i think its because he lied about being challenger and hes just not as good as he says he is

[2023-01-07 18:50:12] <skippy1> exactly! he has a brand and offer his services. not happy whit the rates? don't buy the services! plain and simple.
[2023-01-07 18:50:14] <%+donimusprime1817> also being good at league and being able to coach league are not the same thing. this applies to literally anything competitive
[2023-01-07 18:50:19] <Hermganksyou> @foreverrxx but he didn't lie about challenger, he was chally in like lan, which sure isnt as good but its still chally.
[2023-01-07 18:50:20] <WERTZAO> @skippy1 look they have to be really dumb to give 350$ for a league coaching, i wouldnt even pay 10$ but doesnt excuse him and saying that theres no market its bs
