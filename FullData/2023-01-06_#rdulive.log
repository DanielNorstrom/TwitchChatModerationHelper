[2023-01-06 13:25:27] <%+looplessly> Hey Rdu, would you mind sharing your thoughts on the relative strengths of different tribes right now? Do you, for example, often find any tribe so strong that it‚Äôs worth aiming towards forcing from the start of a game, just based on the tribes which happen to be in? (For example: ‚Äúno murlocs; it‚Äôll be worth forcing apm pirates here.‚Äù) I hope my question is clear. Let me know if not.

[2023-01-06 13:47:42] <CNardog> @RduLIVE most US states the jury poll is based off you are registered to vote. Some make people a higher probability to be selected if they recently moved there. Yes anyone can be picked (Former President Bush was). Goes as long as trial. Can be two days to months
[2023-01-06 13:47:42] <@%ziolxx> @AuggieHC we removed it because it had G2 symbols
[2023-01-06 13:47:42] <$the1immortalnpc> the best way out of jury duty is to commit a low level misdemeanor.
[2023-01-06 13:47:43] <zeefurbs> if youre self employed you can tell them and you might not get selected, so youd probably only lose a day

[2023-01-06 13:48:02] <+surgeongabriel> You gotta take time off work, but if you're an hourly employee sometimes you get to claim "financial hardship" so that you skip jury duty. Most people I know don't like to do jury duty and try to avoid it! You get no compensation for jury duty. Most cases are quick, but I know a guy who was tied up with jury duty for a month! He was not happy!
[2023-01-06 13:48:03] <+danimalgames> Most people get excused day 1, but if you get pulled into a jury it can last awhile

[2023-01-06 13:48:26] <%+dragoncore21> Also jury duty isn‚Äôt 100% that you are on the jury.  You are in the group they choose from.  Different jury duty assignments last for different amounts of time.  One I had was every Tuesday for 3 months.

[2023-01-06 13:48:37] <Yellowersnow1> jury duty is the same as being a channel mod... except you don't get to pick the hours
[2023-01-06 13:48:41] <katya_lemonlime> In Australia, your job has to pay you still while you're at jury duty

[2023-01-06 13:48:51] <+kgblive> Usually you don‚Äôt get picked and it‚Äôs the 1 day. If you do get pick trials usually take 1-3 days at most but occasionally it could be longer like weeks or possibly even months

[2023-01-06 13:49:03] <druiloorx> I would let Jack the Ripper get off any sentence if I was a juror

[2023-01-06 13:49:18] <@%R2DU> @really Adge  Rdu plays ads in between games so no one misses out on action. You can get rid of ads by subbing to the channel Kapp Thank you for understanding HUGGERS Adge

[2023-01-06 13:49:19] <%itssooool3y> @RduLIVE do you think they will pick a streamer to take decisions ?
[2023-01-06 13:49:24] <Leif_LaCroix> no that's not a good reason. you gotta go in and prove you are not impartial

[2023-01-06 13:49:51] <%brireamz> @RduLIVE What's up my favorite romanian streamer, Happy New Year! Loving the haircut, new year, new fresh look
[2023-01-06 13:49:54] <SuperSymn> guys I'm online in an hour can we give him the death penalty real quick?
[2023-01-06 13:49:59] <zeefurbs> It‚Äôs likely, I saw a guy say it was his wifes birthday the next day and they didnt pick him
[2023-01-06 13:49:59] <druiloorx> RDU went to an eminem concert, now he is also racist and homophobic
[2023-01-06 13:50:00] <%Tuneshootin23> He‚Äôs not entirely wrong. I said I have really good friends who are cops and would probably believe them more than someone non cop
[2023-01-06 13:50:01] <$the1immortalnpc> when the prosecution questions you, just sound like an extremist of some sort and you'll almost always be excused from the jury.
[2023-01-06 13:50:08] <stepa242> Well that would be really hard to find somebody in Romania, if you have to not be racist or homophobic :D
[2023-01-06 13:50:08] <+kgblive> Pay check or work situation means nothing to them. You get selected on whether or not you will be impartial to the situation.

[2023-01-06 13:50:35] <WulkenCS> @RduLIVE According to the twitch Algorithms, if you have your whole mmr in title, it brings more viewers. Just a heads up.

[2023-01-06 13:51:17] <MildSambal> Does Romania have a jury?
[2023-01-06 13:51:20] <Leif_LaCroix> I mean shows are usually based on the american system, so yes
[2023-01-06 13:51:23] <@%+Weirdgus> @RduLIVE you should be glad that there aren't 12 random people without legal education who dictate on matters of law, BUT ACTUAL JUDGES you know, like it should be OK
[2023-01-06 13:51:24] <%conesworth> you dont have juries in romania? doesnt that open your criminal justice system to serious corruption?
[2023-01-06 13:51:24] <%+Addersting> It's less corrupt with 12 random people
[2023-01-06 13:51:25] <%itssooool3y> @RduLIVE I studied it in business law and it was a long process
[2023-01-06 13:51:27] <cristosheloo> its not like they come and take you from home, you still have to apply
[2023-01-06 13:51:28] <+TexasMudbug> it's trial by peers so it makes sense
[2023-01-06 13:51:32] <SuperSymn> if the gloves don't fit, you must acquit
[2023-01-06 13:51:32] <%+seppala64> Romania you just pay off the judge right?

[2023-01-06 13:51:50] <magneto_dorito> Yep. And the rules are very loose. The jury can actually say "they are technically guilty but the law is not good"
[2023-01-06 13:51:51] <NitrousOxide123> @RduLIVE the idea is that, you may seem guilty in the eyes of the law but if your community is ok with it you are OK

[2023-01-06 13:55:02] <+Moojor> have you seen the "peers" in twitch chat....
[2023-01-06 13:55:03] <goldegolem> @RduLIVE I know that in some European countries you choose a 'focus' in high school and only have classes based on that, is that the case in Romania?
[2023-01-06 13:55:04] <Shauku123> :D
[2023-01-06 13:55:06] <Yellowersnow1> @RduLIVE Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

[2023-01-06 13:55:09] <imbabanana> @dragoncore21 You know you are technically not judged by your peers, because the lawyers on both side recuse lots of people who might side with one side
[2023-01-06 13:55:09] <%Eggimannd> Fuck those nerds who went to school
[2023-01-06 13:55:11] <+Moojor> That's the sort of people you could be judged by lol
[2023-01-06 13:55:12] <%Eggimannd> what a bunch of losers
[2023-01-06 13:55:16] <Magsi> I'd rather be judged by someone who studied law than someone who knows nothing about it LUL
[2023-01-06 13:55:16] <druiloorx> or letting killer cops off the hook
[2023-01-06 13:55:17] <%DasWolfMan> in america judges usually get appointed don't they?
[2023-01-06 13:55:18] <+CptChaossScII> among us shows how good it is to be judget by random people LUL
[2023-01-06 13:55:19] <%+lemechant20_hs> Not all cases go to jury duty! It‚Äôs on specific requests or crimes
[2023-01-06 13:55:24] <+Jeffaffah> Why would people on shore tell how a ship should sail? They don't understand anyway.
[2023-01-06 13:55:25] <SuperSymn> I wouldn't trust one of my peers with a spoon KEKW

[2023-01-06 13:55:28] <+LadyPenelope_rl> if there's one thing social media has taught me it's that my peers are mostly morons
[2023-01-06 13:55:29] <%phillykallday> It gives less power to the government and more to the people @RduLIVE
[2023-01-06 13:55:36] <+Moojor> @CptChaossScII hahaha

[2023-01-06 13:55:50] <%Eggimannd> @RduLIVE I think a jury in romania should be 5 streamers like you, superJJ, Thisjj, etc
[2023-01-06 13:55:54] <Dr_Brian> @TudorS19998 uh no, in the Johnny depp trial in the UK the judge was corrupt as hell, he had tons of conflict of interest with The Sun
[2023-01-06 13:55:58] <+carrotking> The jury isn‚Äôt used in every case in America, you guys. Lol
[2023-01-06 13:55:58] <%+FisheyeX> I want Frank Caprio to judge me
[2023-01-06 13:56:00] <Magsi> @iiawko not in first world countries though
[2023-01-06 13:56:01] <CNardog> @RduLIVE if you were being accused of a crime, would you rather of a jury of 12 average joes where only one needs to say not guilty for a hung jury or 5 judges who likely think in unison?
[2023-01-06 13:56:10] <%TheRealSkythe> @phillykallday 'the people' is not some benevolent force tho

[2023-01-06 14:02:42] <+kgblive> @dr_brian I mean democracy just needs to develop with the times. People are too easily influenced and it turns election campaigns away from addressing real change and  towards a straight up popularity contest on slogans and hashtags. I‚Äôm not saying voting should stop but a change needs to happen cause the system is broken at it‚Äôs core.

If you do download it, make sure to turn on animated emotes in mod settings, some people don't look at settings and then think there are no animated emotes. All for Android btw

[2023-01-06 16:45:22] <%+Medifaded> maybe taunting warden is the play to increase chance quest reward hits where u need it to
[2023-01-06 16:45:45] <goldegolem> @RduLIVE why not keep the rat for the potential tripple into another theo?

[2023-01-06 17:01:14] <raedelis> @teemeea the plot is acceptable, it set up a lot for the next movie. it was one of the prettiest movies ever made

[2023-01-06 17:01:16] <gbnew_1> @RduLIVE for the Wednesday show - I was not going to watch it initially, but then I gave it a shot and actually liked it. For the Avatar - depends on what you expect - the story is basically the same as the first movie, but the effects are really good

[2023-01-06 17:08:16] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2023-01-06 17:08:31] <+WorthlessMountain> @goldegolem Lol yet Blizzard made it so can get 6,5k with a below average winrate. So if that is true, all that means is the average player doesn't play enough games to reach 6,5k
[2023-01-06 17:08:37] <+sunnykat1> what or who is a kripp?

[2023-01-06 18:57:42] <Freddocino1> somebody playing hoggar would say the opposite
[2023-01-06 18:57:45] <OviHyperion> they should include a button to end the turn and if all players agree the turn ends

[2023-01-06 18:57:50] <wet_farting> just give us the button
[2023-01-06 18:57:50] <GHA_FTW_> I need longer timer
[2023-01-06 18:57:51] <Bastiid> if they reduce timers then they kill APM Pirates

[2023-01-06 18:57:54] <Qseoliam> @RduLIVE what do you think about turbo mode where you get like 15s to make a turn
[2023-01-06 18:57:54] <RoJo_93_> no we need those timers for the people who needs the apm strats
[2023-01-06 18:57:55] <%+rammc> @RduLIVE JJ times out every turn...
[2023-01-06 18:57:56] <Yuro_OK> Remove the timers ixdLaugh
[2023-01-06 18:57:58] <M9tTyC0h3N> @RduLIVE I fell asleep and lost a game i was winning because of the damn timer..
[2023-01-06 18:57:58] <Feon2P> or people at work that need that extra time

[2023-01-06 18:58:03] <+okkeh> I rope way too often. please dont reduce time
[2023-01-06 18:58:04] <+demogorg> Bro did u ever play on mobile ? You need long timers
[2023-01-06 18:58:04] <Moli________> You know all the cards?
[2023-01-06 18:58:05] <get_cranked> they need to add a ready button
[2023-01-06 18:58:05] <Rikkis309> They just need to add "Ready" button that if everyone has pushed the turn can end
[2023-01-06 18:58:06] <+f1rst_f1re> The timers are super long based on how the prior matches go - if a match goes super long due to frogs or something then the timer will be much longer.
[2023-01-06 18:58:07] <grazvans324> or maybe they could add a "ready" button, and u press it when you are ready to fight @RduLIVE
[2023-01-06 18:58:07] <Muzzymoodoe> timer needs to be longer for supperJJ KEKW
[2023-01-06 18:58:10] <%+Vasko_de_gama> Rdu either taking 12 seconds to take his whole turn, or waiting until 12 seconds left to start his moves and running out of time
[2023-01-06 18:58:11] <Fikoblin> i always miss time when playing naga
[2023-01-06 18:58:13] <imarotti> Maybe thay can put a buton when u finish your turn you press

[2023-01-06 19:02:56] <Pedroberbs> prolly lifecoach
[2023-01-06 19:02:56] <ivelaizer> wait 100s wait without rdy button
[2023-01-06 19:03:01] <Freddocino1> some of us wouldnt have that much fun,right
[2023-01-06 19:03:02] <RoJo_93_> because u are a beta
[2023-01-06 19:03:03] <Fonzais> would be interesting to know if they were trolling or really needing that much time
[2023-01-06 19:03:04] <NocturnosPT> what is the use of a ready button if someone is playing infinite pirates?
[2023-01-06 19:03:06] <not_theking> ready don't work
[2023-01-06 19:03:06] <WSL_Wisher> it takes 30  min at most, the method that end the round already exist, so is just enable button, change animation and add 1 listener with 2 conditions, ez pz. @RDU_Live
[2023-01-06 19:03:10] <%+sef242424> with 8 ppl left it wouldnt really work. with top 4 or less it would be super useful
[2023-01-06 19:03:10] <%+heycorman> It was lifecoach
[2023-01-06 19:03:11] <VukKiller> always that one guy who plays pirate casino
[2023-01-06 19:03:11] <%teetime01> The button will come back in the OmegaLUL version and can only be pressed if you tip bob
[2023-01-06 19:03:12] <GHA_FTW_> I will not press the ready button on purpose
[2023-01-06 19:03:18] <Feon2P> i mean statisticaly in 8 players probably one will take maximum time , but after you drop on 2 players ?
[2023-01-06 19:03:21] <@%ziolxx> rduRecruit
[2023-01-06 19:03:21] <Rikkis309> The button needs to be invisible to other players
[2023-01-06 19:03:24] <Pedroberbs> Lifecoach would have a stroke
[2023-01-06 19:03:28] <%Trainingpokemons> An "end turn" button would be great :D
[2023-01-06 19:03:30] <+LeliBRUK> and now everyone is required to play max time????

[2023-01-06 19:03:31] <Freddocino1> and hooktusk with golden baron wouldnt press it, cause he know he wins
[2023-01-06 19:03:33] <Bullnutzz> it already has a ready button @rdulive , on mobile only. all blizzard games are meant to be played on a mobile device.
[2023-01-06 19:03:35] <@%RedNote_EZ> @RduLIVE but what about button to skip the fight?

[2023-01-06 19:03:46] <TryHardLine> @RduLIVE Also kripp said in early alpha tavern had ALL sold-minions. Like you are spawning cats with Chadgar and then your whole shop are those cats KEKL
[2023-01-06 19:03:47] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2023-01-06 19:04:49] <%+pearbear85> If there is no button everyone knows how much time. If there IS a button, then the last person who presses it has power over when to end the tavern. It ends up with some power dynamic issues that isn't fun and holds players hostage to their screen instead of freely walking away for the remaining seconds.
