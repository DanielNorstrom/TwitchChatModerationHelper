[2023-01-06 14:29:24] <@%Tamburmajoren> Oh yeah Sideways is great! Keep coming back and watch the videos

[2023-01-06 15:34:13] <%$Dohregard> I used to live at the foothills of the Smokey Mountains, i think it's about what land was owned before they designated the area a national park
[2023-01-06 15:34:13] <%+AidanFolkes> @praxiz "According to a UN definition, London can be classified as a forest, its 8.4 million trees – almost one for every person – adorning and detoxifying this great city"

[2023-01-06 15:35:12] <+SnowLae> The creation of state and federal lands, including forests, in the US is a crazy history, especially in the mid-atlantic and south-east. Virgina, West Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Maryland etc

[2023-01-06 15:38:18] <Zernach> parents house has apple trees, so when the yard has rotting apples in the fall you got to watch your step
[2023-01-06 15:38:30] <+darklegacy6364> To answer the question, to have private land in National Park it's called "inholdings". In short the land was owned before it became a National Park. The Homestead Act of 1862 protects those who own that land. Selling that land is a different story.
[2023-01-06 15:38:41] <Endwell> "you have chose poorly."
