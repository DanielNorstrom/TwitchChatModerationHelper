[2022-12-29 10:57:40] <Sky_Anon> there's technically a skip for the crate puzzle, but it looked way way slower
[2022-12-29 10:57:47] <BlueHarvey> what I think is cool about this challenge is that, it takes everyone out of their comfort zone of games they already know. It's a terrbile game thats somehow extremely average (at best)
[2022-12-29 10:57:48] <Beastmister> Is the movement scripted in that puzzle?  Looks like you could do it with less moves.

[2022-12-29 14:34:22] <Coffin_Stuffer> How much does Troy Baker cost per line? You might be able to get 20 lines from Troy Baker in the sequel.

[2022-12-29 16:33:17] <GoodNewsforyou> here's good news : one day we'll have to give an account for our life & what we would deserve for our evil (lies, stealing, hatred, unclean thoughts+) is hell. but on the cross Jesus took the punishment we all deserved, then rose again to save us from hell n offers us forgiveness & a hope that goes beyond this earth
