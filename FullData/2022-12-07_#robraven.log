(1) Save up your channel points or (2) Make clips of your favorite moments of the stream. The more you clip the higher your chance of making VIP for being a valued member and helping out Rob with clips for highlight videos.

[2022-12-07 17:45:09] <+riddler1215> saw an interesting thought about the die hard being a Christmas movie thing.  If Die hard is a Christmas movie, then so is Home Alone.  Die Hard is the adult version on Home Alone.
[2022-12-07 17:45:14] <+indianajones102> Rob have you seen the new movie violent night? It is amazing
[2022-12-07 17:45:18] <Difidus> Hi RobRaven you singwell !!

[2022-12-07 17:45:36] <Rasen_BR> take care of yourself
[2022-12-07 17:45:45] <%Vect0rPryde> Can we maybe see some Pirate rapping then?
[2022-12-07 17:45:45] <MidnightWolf1> maybe try some warm tea and honey after the stream? that could help
[2022-12-07 17:45:47] <+Padre_San> Larynx issues, Mate?
[2022-12-07 17:45:57] <+riddler1215> no one that I know of.  Just thought it was an interesting thought

[2022-12-07 17:48:17] <TheOGBookofDaniel> I feel like the kraken should drop loot that pirates have lost to the sea throughout the server. It would make fighting the kraken worth it

(1) Save up your channel points or (2) Make clips of your favorite moments of the stream. The more you clip the higher your chance of making VIP for being a valued member and helping out Rob with clips for highlight videos.

[2022-12-07 18:08:37] <%Jaeknir> that is why I prefer to just listen to people and don't have an opinion ona matter it has become too tedious to have an opinion for me.
[2022-12-07 18:08:38] <%+sassy_gi> I hope that happens
[2022-12-07 18:08:45] <pjplaysxbox1> thats gone
[2022-12-07 18:09:01] <pjplaysxbox1> @dankykong134949 that event is gone
