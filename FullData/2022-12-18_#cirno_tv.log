[2022-12-18 02:15:45] <%$Mrglrglrglrgl> You should buy a switch for multiple games.  This is NOT one of them astrOMEGA
[2022-12-18 02:15:46] <ChaosLordR> I would buy a switch if I could do certain things to it HACKERMANS
[2022-12-18 02:15:47] <+tewi_inabaka> mario cart 8 is a banger on the switch

[2022-12-18 02:15:49] <%razorxscooter> Get a SteamDeck GabeN
[2022-12-18 02:15:50] <rhadnard> get one for mario/zelda/pokemon but not just for this
[2022-12-18 02:15:50] <TrebleZX> this is by far the worst pokemon in the mainline
[2022-12-18 02:15:51] <+tewi_inabaka> especially for the dlc
[2022-12-18 02:15:55] <%Illylia> Switch has been an amazing console so far imo
[2022-12-18 02:16:01] <%Fabricio20> Nope, but if you get some others like the latest Kirby, zelda and such
[2022-12-18 02:16:02] <Icer107> yeah, this game is NOT a Switch buyer, but if you're into character action games, all 3 Bayonetta games are on Switch, those are amazing
