[2022-12-08 19:39:39] <AD1Ckarry> but buffing her range would be a disaster for any other enemy team

[2022-12-08 19:39:45] <%ravilolie> it feels like zeri has none of the options a normal adc has tbh
[2022-12-08 19:39:49] <lifeisgame13> zeri is worse she's ever been

[2022-12-08 19:41:21] <%ravilolie> i think it's the players that stuck with her when she was so bad so the players that play her now are really good
[2022-12-08 19:41:24] <%+aimdanig> @CookieLoLxx She got under 50% winrate.
