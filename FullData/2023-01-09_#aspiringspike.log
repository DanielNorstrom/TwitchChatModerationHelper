[2023-01-09 16:56:21] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Lurrus. While this card may be currently banned in modern, to me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Melira. Thank You.

[2023-01-09 17:29:36] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @adamant0 WRONG! I'm not running any triomes, it's a two color deck and it loses to moon because in modern you have to play a lot of fetches and shocks because you can't afford to take turns off. Blood moon doesn't even stop the 4+ color decks it's supposed to because they get to play 100 answers in their splash colors. It's nonsense and the community needs to move past this relic and grow up and ban the problem cards instead of these miserable hosers. Don't @ me.

[2023-01-09 18:26:12] <Hal9004> it would probably make things better but realistically the actual fix is that WOTC needs to do any fucking testing at all for legacy because it is immediately apparent once you play with M&B or White Plume for more than ten seconds that they are not okay
[2023-01-09 18:26:13] <lagdotcom> tbh yes commander products should be banned from al lformats

[2023-01-09 18:27:16] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> @Guerrilla705 aspike1 aspike2 aspike3
[2023-01-09 18:27:25] <%Goody_Phil> would you say this version is less resilient to artifact hate without the stirrings? @aspiringspike
[2023-01-09 18:27:32] <%+Avinan> I think the format just needs some oversight. Nothing huge.
[2023-01-09 18:27:32] <exactlythreedozenkittens> @Aquinas9 "it's not the initiative cards, it's what they do"
[2023-01-09 18:27:38] <%fourdeltavictor> the undercity is so clearly designed for mulitiplayer
[2023-01-09 18:27:42] <%+deadpool646> Just print “if you have more than one opponent” on commander cards
[2023-01-09 18:27:43] <%$Ocara115> I like keeping commander cards, but some of them are just a bit much, and those should be banned. That's simple
[2023-01-09 18:27:46] <%fourdeltavictor> Like, deal 5????
[2023-01-09 18:27:47] <Redarrow420> true name and fluster are from commander and those feel fine, the recent cards just feel *so* pushed

[2023-01-09 18:27:55] <%anergyboy> @hal9004 so immediately apparent that it took until last month for initiative to show up, even though CLB came out in June?
[2023-01-09 18:27:58] <%fourdeltavictor> 5 is so much
[2023-01-09 18:28:01] <%+Avinan> We could main deck Umori in the stirrings version!
[2023-01-09 18:28:07] <MordeToLight> @anergyboy they got on MTGO  a month ago
[2023-01-09 18:28:10] <dbsman012> Is there some reason people expect an imminant b&r update, or is this just normal between-set ban chatter?
[2023-01-09 18:28:13] <%+IncredibleGator> @anergyboy the cards werent on MTGO right away
[2023-01-09 18:28:19] <+DrTerrier> Kinda feels like Umori lets the opponent know there's little to no interaction, not sure how relevant that would be though

[2023-01-09 18:28:40] <%Aquinas9> @exactlythreedozenkittens I'm saying you can make the gameplay better by changing Undercity without making any changes to White Plume Adventurer etc. If the initiative mechanic only took you to regular dungeons, those decks would be completely average.

I have noticed the opponent has a nonland permanent with CMC 1 or less on their side of the board. Did you consider using Archmage's Charm's "gain control" mode? Thanks

[2023-01-09 18:54:32] <rowrow_> there's some weird rules for what constitutes a "mana ability" but the short of it is if activating an ability adds mana to your mana pool without targeting something, it's a mana ability
[2023-01-09 18:54:33] <%+fearphage> It also doesn't have a target (unlike Deathrite Shaman).

[2023-01-09 18:54:53] <%anergyboy> A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, doesn’t target, and isn’t a loyalty ability

[2023-01-09 18:55:01] <+mi89325> Opponent carefully reading each dungeon, and trying to determine how many times you can cast Acererak.
[2023-01-09 18:55:03] <Sugar_Bandit> I had someone try to argue that skirk prospector isn’t a mana ability it’s a sacrifice ability
[2023-01-09 18:55:03] <%Trustmeimatroll> Judge here, the only thing that makes a mana ability not a mana ability is if it targets (ie Deathrite Shaman) or if its a loyalty ability (iE Chandra torch of defiance)
[2023-01-09 18:55:06] <+Dicho_v2> Better to blow up the heartless right? Make Acererak cost 2 per cast instead of 1?

[2023-01-09 19:15:35] <%+swinda_> Its very forgiving on the timing
[2023-01-09 19:15:50] <%riotboyjhin> did you reset? or is this a run attempt?

[2023-01-09 19:19:27] <+keigatide> You need the ring from him
[2023-01-09 19:19:34] <%+swinda_> sif is mandatory to get the ring that lets you fight 4 kings
[2023-01-09 19:19:44] <%riotboyjhin> @swinda_ by virtue of? BKH has better Raw later in the game iirc.
[2023-01-09 19:19:50] <%enbymage> i used to run DS no *deaths* and wd get crazy nervous + miss parry timings vs gwyn... cannot imagine going for it in no-hit
[2023-01-09 19:19:51] <bakingsoda_98> do you know about thechnique to make gwyn dance
[2023-01-09 19:19:53] <%+swinda_> if you do the DLC before fighting Sif, he will recognize you

[2023-01-09 19:20:30] <%+swinda_> @riotboyjhin you dont need to farm resets/attempts just to get the drop rate for the Crystal Halberd. Yes BKH is better overall, but no-hitters seem to prefer the lack of reset attempts

[2023-01-09 19:21:24] <%riotboyjhin> @swinda_ hm. its a low time investment, but I guess for sake of consistency crystal makes sense.
[2023-01-09 19:21:32] <%+samp6_> no glitches?

[2023-01-09 19:21:54] <bakingsoda_98> if you use a pyromancy a certain way gwyn gets stuck jumping from side to side and you just spam him down

[2023-01-09 19:21:55] <%+swinda_> low time investment, but as someone who has farmed BKH for over an hour for runs it gets annoying swindaLurk

[2023-01-09 19:22:17] <bath_salty> so hyped you doin this run from now!

[2023-01-09 19:23:27] <%riotboyjhin> BKH kill is easy, its just a parry or bs kill off the edge. but yeah, I guess its payoff isn't worth the investment
[2023-01-09 19:23:41] <%+swinda_> @aspiringspike Do you have a savestate for O&S? If so, is it in front of the boss fog? For some reason if you have a save state/save quit out in front of boss fog, their AI will act differently compared to a normal run. Save states typically are set before the giant stair cases down
[2023-01-09 19:24:23] <+the___mad> whats the hit # pb?
[2023-01-09 19:24:28] <bath_salty> y i think about 30-40 is still really good for the beginning
[2023-01-09 19:24:41] <+dotslashgatsby> i forgot the item name but is turning yourself "not" undead not allowed in these runs?
[2023-01-09 19:24:45] <%Blademan69er> 4kings is gonna be hell. That place is a run killer

[2023-01-09 19:43:18] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> when you complete this no-hit run will you then extend it to a no-hit run sequentially of every ds game and peripheral?

[2023-01-09 19:49:00] <bath_salty> @halonen would start with this game DS1, but its old. if u want a game up to date def. elden ring
[2023-01-09 19:49:06] <%+snakeskins777> uw control is so difficult wotc had to print t3feri to simplify the turns.
[2023-01-09 19:49:17] <+akedion> i would recommend ds1, cause i think when you played ds3/elden ring before its really clunky coming back to ds 1
[2023-01-09 19:49:29] <%distinguishednarwhal> DS1 is honestly a better starting point as long as you get thre remastered version
[2023-01-09 19:49:39] <%Blademan69er> DS1 is the UW control of video games aspikeShark
[2023-01-09 19:49:55] <%+jktorborg> is this dark souls 2?
[2023-01-09 19:49:58] <bath_salty> DS1 feels more like a prison deck equivalent lel
[2023-01-09 19:50:19] <+offusk> Yeah ds1 is a slower game because of the jankiness
[2023-01-09 19:50:33] <%+jktorborg> no i mean is this literally dark souls 1 or 2 haha
[2023-01-09 19:50:34] <rhoron_> ds2 is good. it had powerstancing
[2023-01-09 19:50:43] <bath_salty> DS2 is fine but long af
[2023-01-09 19:50:50] <gumbox> @jktorborg this is 1
[2023-01-09 19:50:52] <+im_a_lasgna_hog> from a casual perspective it's very similar
[2023-01-09 19:50:54] <bath_salty> it did really good in implement the base for DS3

[2023-01-09 19:51:00] <gumbox> Is this a remaster or original ver ?
[2023-01-09 19:51:10] <+offusk> remaster
[2023-01-09 19:51:21] <+offusk> but not much is different
[2023-01-09 19:51:34] <Penguin_FTW> the level/world design for 2 just isnt nearly as strong as it is in 1 or 3, the base mechanics are all similar enough that its still fun enough to play
[2023-01-09 19:51:42] <gumbox> Yeah. Was sure it was much more smoother
[2023-01-09 19:52:09] <%Nuclerchckn> What does using the souls do there?
[2023-01-09 19:52:09] <Penguin_FTW> yeah the dlc for 2 is fantastic
[2023-01-09 19:52:20] <Penguin_FTW> gives you xp to spend on levels and upgrades
[2023-01-09 19:52:35] <mgosig> the ring? why no put it on? :)
[2023-01-09 19:52:45] <mgosig> the red one you know
[2023-01-09 19:52:48] <gumbox> You can always go with DeS remaster as a start. Oldest of the souls but very nowadays version on ps5

[2023-01-09 20:35:46] <+GH0stwight> @samp6_ eh, just wondering what the differences were really and if people who played them had an opinion. KH1 is a bit different than KH1 Remix, for example.
[2023-01-09 20:35:58] <+GH0stwight> More content, balance changes, more cutscenes, ect.

[2023-01-09 20:41:44] <Penguin_FTW> @Wolfsokol a no hit run would be invalidated after a hit, limited hit is attempting no hit but just seeing how few hits you can get
[2023-01-09 20:41:53] <+Dicho_v2> @Wolfsokol not resetting whenever you get hit so you can continue to practive for no-hit

[2023-01-09 20:49:44] <Rocha1> @GH0stwight for me: gameplay -> sekiro; envirnment -> bloodborne; exploration -> ER/DS2; boss design -> DS3/BB/ER
[2023-01-09 20:50:13] <Rocha1> sekiro's boss design is amazing too nvm
[2023-01-09 20:50:14] <+GH0stwight> I've also heard bb gives you some more options for builds and tinkering and with sekiro you just kind of get what you get. and i really like the customization in elden ring, that was sick.
[2023-01-09 20:50:51] <+offusk> sekiro is my favorite fromsoft game
[2023-01-09 20:51:00] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> can you arch the archer first?

[2023-01-09 20:51:06] <%+MrCleverpig> sekiro has skill trees and whatnot, all the others are classic rpg style

[2023-01-09 20:54:31] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @aspiringspike Why do you light that bonfire? Doesn't it count as a hit when you start coughing from smoke inhilation because you made a fire indoors?
[2023-01-09 20:54:39] <%+fallofgondolin> Is there a lore reason why everything looks so pristine where these two are vs the more spooky areas from before?
