[2023-01-03 14:48:02] <LCorazza> The earliest DEX it em you can get now is near Mytha. You would need to kill 2 meme bosses

[2023-01-03 14:50:02] VIEWERS: 703
[2023-01-03 14:50:25] <%+AndyDale93> I finished the original Dark Souls 2 but not Scholar version.
[2023-01-03 14:50:35] <%+kmacdone> i did a magic build on it for my first run, and that is basically impossible in DLC. stopped after Fume Knight
[2023-01-03 14:50:36] <%TheSlinger90> My main gripe is that the boss fights are mediocre/bad. But I like the game a lot.
[2023-01-03 14:50:42] <LCorazza> Nico, once you switch to Mace, kill Skelly Lords and Jabba so you can get a +5 dex item
[2023-01-03 14:50:47] <jcorbach> Dino, something I do not fully understand: you say you do not know DS2, but you did some no-hit runs with it?
[2023-01-03 14:50:54] <!%noxifoxi> poison area
[2023-01-03 14:50:54] <%Baryon23> before mytha

[2023-01-03 14:51:08] <%+LMental23> the regular game bosses are a bit easy but the DLC ones are hard
[2023-01-03 14:51:15] <%+TheLeviathong> 8k hours btw
[2023-01-03 14:51:16] <LilithTheForgotten> Hey Nico hope youre doing well

[2023-01-03 14:51:45] <%+unagiro> bullshit bosses + map design + adp + hollow hp mechanic + fall damage + weapon durability + no iframes on fog walls that's probably a good summary of what people hate
[2023-01-03 14:51:51] <%+simoniquous> you might be able to tickle him to death within the next 2 hours

[2023-01-03 14:54:11] <jcorbach> @jcorbach Yep, I agree, I suppose doing a non-hit run does not mean at all that you know the full game, just a specific way. But I was curious to understand if Dino has never played the game the normal way.

[2023-01-03 16:24:29] <%BenderZGreat> @CantusMechanicus arguably NG+7 bosses aren't the same as NG bosses, so you could go down a huge rabbit hole where you need to go through all NG cycles to consider it "true all bosses", it's a goofy issue

[2023-01-03 17:01:30] <LCorazza> yes. But i'm not sure if you have range with crossbow
[2023-01-03 17:01:34] <TysonJDevereaux> *In this world
[2023-01-03 17:01:36] <LCorazza> Anyway you have stats for the bow
[2023-01-03 17:01:43] <%remiri> popCat
[2023-01-03 17:01:47] <LittleWing322> thats for the bossfight
[2023-01-03 17:01:48] <%CantusMechanicus> @TysonJDevereaux you know the origin of that right? Durability was linked to frames spent inside the enemy/wall. So when they brought it to PC and doubled the FPS from 30-60, they uh, doubled the durability damage taken since it was 2x as fast now
[2023-01-03 17:01:49] <frosthollow> U can  poison him
[2023-01-03 17:01:50] <TysonJDevereaux> that's for dragonrider
[2023-01-03 17:01:56] <%Lellam_> its to make dragonriders arena bigger

[2023-01-03 17:02:14] <LittleWing322> imagine not letting dragonrider die to fall damage
[2023-01-03 17:02:15] <TysonJDevereaux> But durability in DS2 is still a threat if you want to kill all enemies in an area
[2023-01-03 17:02:23] <%remiri> the cupboards are bare

[2023-01-03 17:24:29] <%MrNinja1234> In other news, internet micro-celebrity Angus "TheHappyHob" Mason has been arrested today following allegations of money laundering. His stream on Twitch frequently featured bets he'd make with his chat where he would gift thousands of subs on a loss. Involving things like completing Dark Souls games without getting hit or winning Call of Duty: Warzone games, many questioned how he could afford these gift subs given his complete lack of skill. Angus has said he's representing himself at trial.

[2023-01-03 17:33:42] <%badmagnet> I think he has a Warzone audience but I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword. People aren't there to see him play well I don't think. As far as skill goes he's fine, not as good as I'd expect from someone who plays 5-8 hours a day every day.

[2023-01-03 17:35:35] <%+TheLeviathong> Peak age is Counter Strike is like 22-23, very few players make it to late 20s

[2023-01-03 17:35:42] <%Baryon23> it's really only for the PVP or MOBA games
[2023-01-03 17:35:47] <%badmagnet> He won't ever be as good as actual pro guys but he can definitely be better. Reaction speed goes with age but game sense doesn't. He just doesn't have any real awareness yet, which is why he plays better when he actually listens to Blondie about what to do and when.

[2023-01-03 17:35:56] <+KarottenPalme> there was that one german kid that reaced grandmaster at the age of 14 or 15 and they say the only reason he wasn't higher is because he spent too much time with school to become challenger

[2023-01-03 18:18:34] <!%noxifoxi> @pie_brother 10k hours probably
[2023-01-03 18:18:35] <%MrNinja1234> @Layman64 no, just regular non-dungeon bosses

[2023-01-03 18:19:18] <pie_brother> he's the easiest parry in the game
[2023-01-03 18:19:20] <@%a_chu> Old iron King is not in the any% no hit route
[2023-01-03 18:19:22] <Breadcrumbs85> Can you agro them and then shoot them from the stairs ?
[2023-01-03 18:19:23] <LittleWing322> Parry sound in DS2 is the best sound tho
[2023-01-03 18:19:27] <@%Sarah88_66> Just git gud Kapp
[2023-01-03 18:19:27] <@%a_chu> so ofc he doesn't know OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 18:19:33] <LCorazza> if 4 do not work. Then i don't think it is possible
[2023-01-03 18:19:33] <%+oesti090> I love how the pursuer has like a gazillion moves that he barely uses
[2023-01-03 18:19:36] <@%Sarah88_66> very true chu OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 18:19:37] <pie_brother> @a_chu ah true
[2023-01-03 18:19:47] <@%a_chu> people be ignorant af about challenge runs LULW
[2023-01-03 18:19:49] <LittleWing322> Dont forget ur souls
[2023-01-03 18:19:56] <pie_brother> I hate this area so i dont blame him for doing the 1mil souls
[2023-01-03 18:20:04] <%+mmancini10> is that snow effect on the screen something you have enabled? pretty cool

[2023-01-03 18:20:24] <Stalinsss> no DAMAGE 1 lvl tomorrow
[2023-01-03 18:20:28] <!%noxifoxi> it's easier if you lock on KEKW
[2023-01-03 18:20:34] <pie_brother> lock on for nerds
[2023-01-03 18:20:54] <LCorazza> @dinossindgeil Swap your hook into laddle
[2023-01-03 18:20:56] <LittleWing322> i think rolling to the left is more reliable
[2023-01-03 18:21:02] <%MrNinja1234> staying locked off made pvp easier too
[2023-01-03 18:21:09] <%abluecardigan> the lore is in the name

[2023-01-03 18:21:54] <$sa10pururin> The Pursuer lurks in Drangleic. He seeks the bearer of the sign and will not rest until his target is slain.
[2023-01-03 18:21:59] <%MrNinja1234> pretty sure the pursuers were trying to kill the bearers of the curse
