[2023-01-03 09:08:05] <%$Zencodion> Its been chill , I got into competitive mario kart 8 deluxe for funzies and man its tough
[2023-01-03 09:09:10] <%TurtleExpress> Havent played MK in years, but I can definitely see it being rough thinking back to the times Wetwo played it on stream
[2023-01-03 09:09:37] <%TurtleExpress> So much bullshit like blue shell and the bullet to mess you up PepeHands
[2023-01-03 09:10:00] <%$Zencodion> yeah its like that times 100 with strategies in the game like bagging ( sitting in boxes grabbing good items)
[2023-01-03 09:10:16] <!%+Nbg13> holiday, what was that?
[2023-01-03 09:11:10] <%$Zencodion> but theres also a lot of tech while driving in the game thats really addicting
