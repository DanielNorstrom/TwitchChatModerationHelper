[2022-12-15 17:24:23] <%+PlagueSD> I don't play single player games. I find them quite boring.
[2022-12-15 17:24:23] <+lts_Sosa> Can’t stand the 30fps on console on fallout 76
[2022-12-15 17:25:06] <+lts_Sosa> Witcher 3 update is awesome.
[2022-12-15 17:25:07] <%thedream706> ESO is to different compared a single player game like Skyrim
[2022-12-15 17:25:11] <Dogekans> i love how 76 is not a build simulator focus like fallout 4 is. fallout 4 the game feels like it punishes you if you dont build. 76 does not do that.

[2022-12-15 17:28:43] <%+Airikaybeni> its so deep.  it has 10 years worth.  its more similar to a single player story wise
[2022-12-15 17:28:52] <%SmokeyHQ> @gabzwickers thing is with that is ESO is set before certain other TES games and Manimarco features in those story so he can’t die as it would ruin that lore and canon
[2022-12-15 17:28:53] <%+brewmasterdao> ffxiv has alot more character development

[2022-12-15 17:43:28] <%craw_papi50> but new world is a cool skin over a boring mmo. its pretty but has no core. the quests and lore are garbage
[2022-12-15 17:43:29] <%Donnie_Chadh> Are there any aspects of NW pvp games that you would like to see in ESO?
[2022-12-15 17:43:31] <%miss_gunz> the levelling on new world is such a snore fear

[2022-12-15 17:46:08] <ChaoticSquish> New World is the only game i've been able to spend a whole day just gathering rss and not notice the time going by.
[2022-12-15 17:46:22] <%+Airikaybeni> yeah big servers are nice.  just wish you could switch between them.  even if had to play

[2022-12-15 19:30:18] <%+scifisarah> trying to save up my eso+ crowns for the house I want when it swings around, is easier to buy little crown stuff for gold from people
[2022-12-15 19:30:34] <@%+brockhoeft1991> @terran_bear crowns usually go for 1200 to 1 all the way up to 1500 to 1. so the any race bundle could cost u 3.6 to 4 5 million gold

[2022-12-15 22:02:03] <JimmyJJShabadu> if you're looking for vicious ophidian you'd have a better chance at having it drop on veteran instead of normal. in normal the drop chances flip and you're more likely to get the trial-specific sets.

[2022-12-15 22:17:16] <%willis3120> The rule is, if delt dies it’s mandatory tbag
