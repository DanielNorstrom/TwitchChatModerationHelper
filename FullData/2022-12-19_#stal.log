[2022-12-19 19:36:21] <@%Jam_Dodger> i would say tmenu mods
[2022-12-19 19:36:21] <%Goregie> yo we got the hero goal
[2022-12-19 19:36:25] <@%Laww__> im not a mod person tho
[2022-12-19 19:36:25] <%Goregie> gj team
[2022-12-19 19:36:36] <%Keld__> So the real way to play skyrim is actually to just mod the game
[2022-12-19 19:36:40] <@%Laww__> @Goregie WICKED welcome back
[2022-12-19 19:36:43] <%Keld__> You mod the game for 100+hrs and play it for 5min
[2022-12-19 19:36:46] <%Goregie> your used to being carried
[2022-12-19 19:36:47] <%Keld__> then go back to modding
[2022-12-19 19:36:54] <%spellsword91> I would check the game out for a bit before thinking of mods too much
[2022-12-19 19:37:12] <+NikoCakey> Yo yo. stalalaLurk
[2022-12-19 19:37:15] <%Pillowyzeal> stalalaSwole
[2022-12-19 19:37:15] <%PsyFi_ZA> menu mods, chracter customization mods, gfx mods, mesh mods, lighting mods, companion mods, weather mods, survival mods, skill and magic mods etc... its easy really :)

[2022-12-19 19:37:30] <%TheKo0ts> there's a "rain onions" mod... does that work for you?
[2022-12-19 19:37:34] <%spellsword91> thinking back on it I replayed oblivion a lot more than skyrim stalalaHmm
[2022-12-19 19:37:52] <%TheKo0ts> ngl... I did changed the dragons with Thomas the engine
[2022-12-19 19:37:54] <%+GraveyardBrawl> I will not be weak. I carry stal all over the place. stalalaSwole
[2022-12-19 19:37:57] <%TheKo0ts> pretty scary stuff
[2022-12-19 19:37:58] <@%Laww__> i think ull play it till the first dungeon and quit in the first dungeon KEKW ngl
[2022-12-19 19:37:59] <%senybonito> Just mod in K-On characters
[2022-12-19 19:38:16] <%gama41> sounds like classic stal gaming
[2022-12-19 19:38:17] <@%Laww__> true seny is a genius
[2022-12-19 19:38:21] <%Raikyr_> My experience with skyrim is
[2022-12-19 19:38:24] <%PsyFi_ZA> the game is fine on default, you can get the Unofficial Patch mod since that fixes A LOT of bugs but you can get that in the creation store in game without Nexus mods
[2022-12-19 19:38:25] <%Raikyr_> dragons are pushovers
[2022-12-19 19:38:38] <%Raikyr_> very hard.
[2022-12-19 19:38:38] <%+RegiBrock> For me I want someone to mod Skyrim to turn the dragon into Xeems just yelling
[2022-12-19 19:38:40] <%senybonito> Usually people spend hours finding mods for the game and by the time they login they're burnt out already
[2022-12-19 19:38:42] <%PsyFi_ZA> you can...with mods LUL
[2022-12-19 19:38:49] <%+RegiBrock> and give it a giant ass beard
[2022-12-19 19:38:56] <%+GraveyardBrawl> Yeah the game isnt very cute friendly.
[2022-12-19 19:39:09] <%PsyFi_ZA> and then they crash Rainge
[2022-12-19 19:39:28] VIEWERS: 309
[2022-12-19 19:39:30] <%TheKo0ts> mod crashes Rainge
[2022-12-19 19:39:31] <%+GraveyardBrawl> Hoard all the loot stal. Here we go again.
[2022-12-19 19:39:34] <%+RegiBrock> For me I HATE the 50 shades of brown/grey that Skyrim has all the time
[2022-12-19 19:39:44] <@%Laww__> u should just play the regular game first imo anyways
[2022-12-19 19:39:52] <%Keld__> Sometimes its mod load order that causes crashes

[2022-12-19 19:40:29] <%TheKo0ts> special edition was the first HD free update they did if you had the base game

[2022-12-19 19:41:00] <%TheKo0ts> most mods are made for the base version
