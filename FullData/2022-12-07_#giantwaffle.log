[2022-12-07 17:32:31] Joining #giantwaffle..
[2022-12-07 17:32:31] VIEWERS: 1 539
[2022-12-07 17:32:31] You have joined #giantwaffle
[2022-12-07 17:32:36] <%banshay3> the concept is the same
[2022-12-07 17:32:42] <%KoniQ111> non-binary trees is just binary trees with extra elements
[2022-12-07 17:32:43] <m1ntyb0iz> neetcode is good
[2022-12-07 17:32:45] <%$PaulFlies> Search tree walk maybe
[2022-12-07 17:32:45] <%cmmeth> its the same
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <+DatoPotatoDato> inorder works with any tree its the same concept
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <%banshay3> what he just explained is what you will do
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <Dude_S14> create a class function that sends the value of the added file to the parent, and it just keeps calling the parent of the class until you get to root?
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <Alminta> Could look up DFS
[2022-12-07 17:32:48] <%brewerdc> THat one
[2022-12-07 17:32:50] <%brewerdc> 5 Simple Steps
[2022-12-07 17:32:52] <olm_alone_> its the same, jsut replace the 2 binary outputs with all your children instead
[2022-12-07 17:32:53] <%Munschmann> It's the same
[2022-12-07 17:32:53] <%brewerdc> That will help
[2022-12-07 17:32:56] <espi> search for a tree walk or non-binary tree
[2022-12-07 17:33:08] <%brewerdc> Yes
[2022-12-07 17:33:08] <Stragmol> @banshay3 but confusing unless you know the difference
[2022-12-07 17:33:08] <%+W84M3> yes
[2022-12-07 17:33:14] <%brewerdc> Title
[2022-12-07 17:33:23] <espi> YEP
[2022-12-07 17:33:25] <%brewerdc> Need to
[2022-12-07 17:33:31] <%brewerdc> Learning day
[2022-12-07 17:33:33] <%banshay3> just watch 2x
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <ashooby> think of it this way: binary is `for c in [left, right]: # do loop`, this case is: `for c in children: # do loop`
[2022-12-07 17:33:51] <proste_Fefko> you would have a while children != none
[2022-12-07 17:33:53] <byGeeky> it still blows my mind that indians are a type of asian
[2022-12-07 17:33:54] <Ihana_Mies> make a function to increase the size which calls the same function on parent or children, recursion done
[2022-12-07 17:33:55] <%NotPeaK> If you skip it how do we learn? waffleSad
[2022-12-07 17:33:59] <+TwitchPlusMe> To understand recursion, you must understand recursion slootYEP
[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <%$PaulFlies> I wish I had YouTube at university. Would have been nice to get alternative explanations of stuff i didn’t understand
[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <Flobu_> that looks like a 3blue1brown video just with different voice over
[2022-12-07 17:34:11] <%cmmeth> you dont
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%$Thermaight> that is what the stack does for you
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%gartoks> you dont
[2022-12-07 17:34:15] <%KoniQ111> Python does this for you
[2022-12-07 17:34:17] <%cmmeth> thats what the recursion does
[2022-12-07 17:34:18] <%brewerdc> The computer does that for you
[2022-12-07 17:34:19] <+DeMayon> That’s recursion
[2022-12-07 17:34:24] <Stragmol> thats what you get with recursion
[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <+FlyingVillage> Always ask the parent
[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <%+W84M3> @Giantwaffle think of it this way... you are doing "current_node.size += ..." in this tiem just call a function that gets the node parent and to stop the recursion you check if there is no parent
[2022-12-07 17:34:29] <olm_alone_> you dont need to think that way with recursion, you dont need to keep track
[2022-12-07 17:34:30] <%$Thermaight> tree traversal is a stack, you can do it with recursion (implicit stack) or explicitly
[2022-12-07 17:34:34] <+echoteecat> that's the magic of recursion, you just end up in the node, and going "back up" is just returning
[2022-12-07 17:34:37] <%KoniQ111> You call a function inside a function and when it's done, you return to the original
[2022-12-07 17:34:38] <IceKingFlash> This sounds so bad  LOLLLLLLLLLL
[2022-12-07 17:34:40] <%banshay3> you have a variable that holds the reference to the root_node. use this to start. for the recursion you don't need to know where you are
[2022-12-07 17:34:45] <Redster11> each not needs to have a list of child nodes that it can point to
[2022-12-07 17:34:45] <@%^Moobot> Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2022-12-07 17:34:45] <%$PaulFlies> Draw it out
[2022-12-07 17:34:47] <%brewerdc> He's almost there guys pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:34:47] <m1ntyb0iz> you track state in an argument to the recursion
[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <%bobolpwnz> def traverse(node):   for child in node.children:      traverse(child)
[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <%banshay3> and it's under a 100k
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <%brewerdc> ALWAYS have an escape check
[2022-12-07 17:35:19] <%KoniQ111> Entire chat on their way to tell waffle how to do recursion peepoRun
[2022-12-07 17:35:28] <%$Thermaight> do_thing(current, children):    print(current)    for child in children:      do_thing(child)
[2022-12-07 17:35:31] <%brewerdc> if (children.count == 0) return;
[2022-12-07 17:35:49] <%+W84M3> thinking in that direction is more complicated becasue you have multiple children... if you start back and go up you just need to use the parent and stop when there is no parent
[2022-12-07 17:35:50] <%$PaulFlies> @koniq111 KEKW ‘me me me i know’
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <%KoniQ111> @brewerdc won't 'for child in children' do the same tho?
[2022-12-07 17:36:42] <headlightlo> <3 <3 <3 <3 Any one excited for the up coming $20000 M1 GAME CONSOLE ?!??!?! MAXIXES.. CC .... O.O .... MM
[2022-12-07 17:36:44] <Dude_S14> could you do a class method called add_size, and inside that call this.parent.add_size, then it would go up all the way to root?
[2022-12-07 17:36:46] <%banshay3> @Giantwaffle less than or equal 100k
[2022-12-07 17:36:47] <+ReySteaL> look for the Breadth-first search algorithm
[2022-12-07 17:36:47] <%+em_t_hed> is this a pyramid scheme Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <%cmmeth> just need the size YEP
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <Redster11> Breath-First-Search on Trees
[2022-12-07 17:37:02] <Schwee09> i just used a stack to keep track of my current path, and then every time i found a file i would loop through the stack to add the size ['/', 'a', 'e']
[2022-12-07 17:37:26] <%+W84M3> you have a size variable in the nodes... if you do all the calculations in the tree construction you dont need to do any of this
[2022-12-07 17:37:34] <%cmmeth> you can just add it to the size
[2022-12-07 17:37:42] <%KoniQ111> @headlightlo yes mod this msg right here susHmm
[2022-12-07 17:37:58] <%+W84M3> when you originally increase the sie of a dir... also increase in the parents
[2022-12-07 17:38:02] <%brewerdc> @KoniQ111 That works too
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <Ihana_Mies> where are you keeping the list of files?
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <%+W84M3> that way it's already set
[2022-12-07 17:38:19] <%cmmeth> the recursion knows
[2022-12-07 17:38:20] <%banshay3> when you've been to all children
[2022-12-07 17:38:21] <DiamondDestructe> oo boy, tree traversal
[2022-12-07 17:38:26] BAN: headlightlo (600s)
[2022-12-07 17:38:35] <+ReySteaL> look up Breadth/Depth-first search
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <%Chronoes> you don't need a visited set in a tree
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <+DeMayon> It’s recursion it does
[2022-12-07 17:38:52] <iamjoy7> just joining what are you trying to do
[2022-12-07 17:38:59] <Jayray84> just recursion makes the trick ;)
[2022-12-07 17:39:04] <%Chronoes> recursive depth-first search will handle it for you, just gotta understand that part
[2022-12-07 17:39:06] <burtis_trindinstein> @Giantwaffle hows Melvor progressing?
[2022-12-07 17:39:07] <%KoniQ111> DFS
[2022-12-07 17:39:15] <deep5> Dfs recursion will take care of that
[2022-12-07 17:39:20] <%brewerdc> @KoniQ111 Just basic principle, for  recursion, you need an escape check to break the recursion.
[2022-12-07 17:39:33] <%banshay3> Clap
[2022-12-07 17:39:42] <%brewerdc> @KoniQ111 The loop is doing that for you
[2022-12-07 17:39:56] <%cmmeth> for child in working_node.children
[2022-12-07 17:40:05] <%+W84M3> i really don't want to spam... but while you are adding the sizes to a dir, call a recursive function to add it to the parent, that way you have all parents up to date on the sizes and then you just check that size and filter is <= x
[2022-12-07 17:40:28] <imNoxel> ^
[2022-12-07 17:40:36] <%cmmeth> monkaHmm
[2022-12-07 17:40:37] <%banshay3> @W84M3 I think he will end up with a recursive function... eventually
[2022-12-07 17:41:02] <imNoxel> yeah but you can do it in the main loop, and just read it out after. no need to go through the tree again
[2022-12-07 17:41:03] <McFatbutt> NOTED
[2022-12-07 17:41:09] <%cmmeth> @w84m3, we are getting there, slowly ... might take the whole stream, but we wil lget there
[2022-12-07 17:41:14] <+IrUnan71> can u teach matlab
[2022-12-07 17:41:18] <%+W84M3> yes he will... but he will go up->down instead of down->up
[2022-12-07 17:41:40] <Dude_S14> create a stack of children and once you've searched it pop it off, and do while len(stack) >= 1
[2022-12-07 17:41:50] <whyando> function SUM(node) {  sum = 0  for child of node.children   sum += SUM(child)  return sum }
[2022-12-07 17:42:22] <%+W84M3> at least in my brain it looks simpler to do it this way instead of going all over the children... becasue then he doesn't even need to keep  a lsit of children
[2022-12-07 17:42:35] <Lyrienne> trying to do recursion and parse twitch chat at the same time challenge
[2022-12-07 17:42:42] <Jayray84> what if children is 0
[2022-12-07 17:43:03] <%cmmeth> return the size ot that dir
[2022-12-07 17:43:03] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-07 17:43:10] <%+W84M3> as long and you have all directories updated with the sizes you don't really care if a dir has n children or not...
[2022-12-07 17:43:25] <whyando> YES
[2022-12-07 17:43:30] <%banshay3> Clap
[2022-12-07 17:43:42] <%KoniQ111> make a variable with value 0, add children sizes to it. that way with no children it stays 0
[2022-12-07 17:43:44] <Alminta> You can iterate over an empty list. It just won't do anything
[2022-12-07 17:43:53] <%banshay3> return something
[2022-12-07 17:44:08] <%banshay3> at most 100k
[2022-12-07 17:44:11] <%Immp> node.size, not child.size
[2022-12-07 17:44:47] <%cmmeth> the asnwer wants <= 100000
[2022-12-07 17:44:48] <Ihana_Mies> calculate the size on the fly
[2022-12-07 17:44:50] <+iSir_Ike> just tuned in, whats going on?
[2022-12-07 17:45:09] <%banshay3> @cmmeth this is going to be fun

[2022-12-07 17:45:19] <+iSir_Ike> ahh i seee
[2022-12-07 17:45:21] <%cmmeth> @isir_ike, a struggle to understand recursion
[2022-12-07 17:45:40] <%Chronoes> you will need to keep sizes per directory
[2022-12-07 17:45:49] <+0ddR> still hacking the planet?
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <%+MasterKraft> parent always exists?
[2022-12-07 17:46:12] <+iSir_Ike> i am not versed in coding tongue <3
[2022-12-07 17:46:22] <+0ddR> watching makes me feel dumb
[2022-12-07 17:46:25] <%KoniQ111> if parent is not none though
[2022-12-07 17:46:31] <%anx_gotta> Just got back. He implementing a depth first tree traversal?
[2022-12-07 17:46:41] <%brewerdc> @anx_gotta Yep
[2022-12-07 17:46:41] <+iSir_Ike> i dont know whats going on, i haff to googlru thigs
[2022-12-07 17:46:42] <%cmmeth> final answer: 3 NODDERS
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%DX_Plates> Giantwaffle Re-read question... AT MOST 100,000
[2022-12-07 17:46:51] <%banshay3> you can use your variables in the f-string directly using {}
[2022-12-07 17:46:53] <Schwee09> isnt it at most 100000? <= 100000
[2022-12-07 17:46:56] <%banshay3> Pog
[2022-12-07 17:47:18] <%TigerLuv> cmmeth wait I was told 42 was always the answer
[2022-12-07 17:47:25] <%banshay3> if parent.size == None -> 0
[2022-12-07 17:47:32] <%GFQPR1882> That’s true what if there is no parent
[2022-12-07 17:47:36] <+DatoPotatoDato> check if node is null
[2022-12-07 17:47:40] <%KoniQ111> nono
[2022-12-07 17:47:41] <%banshay3> sorry parent == None
[2022-12-07 17:47:43] <%KoniQ111> if parent is not none
[2022-12-07 17:47:46] <%brewerdc> Gotta null check

[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%$Thermaight> speed running trees and recursion
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%GFQPR1882> waffleHmm waffleNote NOPERS took to long LUL
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%$PaulFlies> I mean that’s basically a coding interview in some places
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <Zuiuzz> day 7 btw :D
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <$MrMoneybagMan> Good job Clap
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <ashooby> the next part is easier
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%brewerdc> Part2 should be another dose of dope
[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <+rofl1436> 5Head here we go
[2022-12-07 17:49:50] <+echoteecat> woo!
[2022-12-07 17:49:50] <Zoocha> the 1% feeling of coding, the other 99% being Sadge

[2022-12-07 17:49:51] <%cmmeth> WE should get hired as college profs KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:49:51] <%Hurtwolf> 5Head ?
[2022-12-07 17:49:52] <@%$Apparentthreat> tree traversal is like a sophomore/junior level course in CS. You've got lots more to learn Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:49:52] <monsef> @Giantwaffle did you see the openai api website
[2022-12-07 17:49:54] <Maximus439> 5Head
[2022-12-07 17:49:55] <+0ddR> my brain hurts
[2022-12-07 17:49:55] <%brewerdc> Now you get to use the function
[2022-12-07 17:49:56] <IceKingFlash> Lol
[2022-12-07 17:49:58] <%DX_Plates> Now you write it down as 4 hours, and you're half way done with a work day.
[2022-12-07 17:49:59] <%+MasterKraft> what was the point of adding to parent.size?
[2022-12-07 17:50:05] <Kurbol> General coding tip: Recursion will almost always be slower than an iterative solution and tends to run out of memory. Recursion is easier for humans to reason about though for some problems.
[2022-12-07 17:50:05] <Phinnick> well done. Trees are hard. As a game engineer they are suffering :P
[2022-12-07 17:50:05] <+rofl1436> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:50:06] <%Hurtwolf> widePepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:50:09] <ashooby> oh, though I guess it might not be easier if your code isn't set up right
[2022-12-07 17:50:14] <+rofl1436> about that pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:50:17] <AleXanDreMau> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:50:24] <%cmmeth> it's easy with your function
[2022-12-07 17:50:29] <IceKingFlash> Ok then more coding
[2022-12-07 17:50:33] <+iSir_Ike> if i wanted to start coding and progress into something further, where would i start?
[2022-12-07 17:50:42] <Myekos> "a directory"
[2022-12-07 17:50:52] <%brewerdc> while loops with recursion?
[2022-12-07 17:50:54] <%$PaulFlies> Why go to all this effort… rm -rf / Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:50:55] <%GFQPR1882> EZ delete all :)
[2022-12-07 17:51:04] <%deathfurr> just do format c: and stop worrying about directories

[2022-12-07 17:51:35] <%+W84M3> it should at least
[2022-12-07 17:51:35] <%KoniQ111> Check root for total size taken, -40 mil, thats the minimum directory size to delete
[2022-12-07 17:51:37] <%Chronoes> it's pretty easy once you have the DFS part down
[2022-12-07 17:51:38] <%banshay3> you have created all the tools you need

[2022-12-07 17:51:53] <Myekos> sort the sizes, find the one that is first under 3000000
[2022-12-07 17:51:56] <IceKingFlash> More coding
[2022-12-07 17:52:01] <%cmmeth> just like 3 more lines and you are there
[2022-12-07 17:52:17] <%brewerdc> Add a depth tracker property to node?

[2022-12-07 17:52:36] <%banshay3> Pog
[2022-12-07 17:53:17] <%Chronoes> @DX_Plates you need to calculate the current amount of free space and then how much you need to delete to have 30M free
[2022-12-07 17:53:18] <Slymph> @GFQPR1882 Sure u can, its just that nothing happens Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:53:23] <%banshay3> that's a bug
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <ixwt> @DX_Plates Eh, I just did a recursive call, keeping track of the closest number that was greater than the needed amount.
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <%banshay3> root_node.size is used space
[2022-12-07 17:53:36] <Schwee09> total_space - root_node.size

[2022-12-07 17:54:45] <%deathfurr> now it's negative again
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <%banshay3> now if you have a negative number, you have enough space

[2022-12-07 17:55:29] <@%$Apparentthreat> Simply tell the admins that all files are necessary and to increase the disk size by 20 GB
[2022-12-07 17:55:35] <@%Str0ngPaprika> Just sort all the directories?
[2022-12-07 17:55:41] <%$Thermaight> sizes are unique (for this problem)
[2022-12-07 17:55:43] <%KoniQ111> print the node size in calc and look at the output Pepega
[2022-12-07 17:55:48] <%+W84M3> your answer will be the size of directory you will delete... just put all sizes in a lsit, sort it and check the value

[2022-12-07 17:56:00] <%banshay3> @Thermaight and if they weren't it would not matter for the answer

[2022-12-07 17:56:09] <%cmmeth> leave it all in
[2022-12-07 17:56:27] <%cmmeth> just add it to a list at the end
[2022-12-07 17:56:27] <@%$Apparentthreat> TigerLuv it's what I do *shrug* pepeLaugh  We have monitoring software to alert us at certain thresholds. Increasing disk size is better than micromanaging files
[2022-12-07 17:56:31] <%+W84M3> you dont need to use this function anymore... it already did it's job
[2022-12-07 17:56:35] <%banshay3> you need that function to calculate the sizes at least once
[2022-12-07 17:56:49] <%deathfurr> @Apparentthreat format C also does wonders

[2022-12-07 18:03:52] <ashooby> I used dicts
[2022-12-07 18:03:54] <%$Tabakhase> that whole tree thing is smoke you didnt need - just absolute filepaths, foreach this and condense to directories splitting on / ignoring the last (filename)

[2022-12-07 18:04:43] <%$Thermaight> knowing that the input is already a tree traversal, you can actually do it as a running problem and never build the tree

[2022-12-07 18:05:17] <%KoniQ111> @DonnieQuest ChatGPT solvers have not done this i think
[2022-12-07 18:05:17] <%+W84M3> i ended up using a directory list that would link to the parent and keep the sizes updated that way with recursion, kind of a tree, but not really
[2022-12-07 18:05:24] <ashooby> yeah, this was a great problem. I'm a fan of tree related things :p
