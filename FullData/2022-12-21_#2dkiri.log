[2022-12-21 15:39:37] <%multiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii> just write as many i's as you have space for
[2022-12-21 15:39:45] <ForeverMash> The only thing elven traders are good for is testing new traps.
[2022-12-21 15:39:47] <%multiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii> i don't even remember how many there are
[2022-12-21 15:40:15] <The_Holas> you can change names now? dont you ..
[2022-12-21 15:40:28] <%multiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii> this was the lowest number of i's that was available

[2022-12-21 15:41:06] <%hi_im_meo> Good morning! Looks like our dwarves are doing swimmingly
[2022-12-21 15:41:10] <%KaldrisRelm> If these are elves, please buy all of their 'living wood' items and then burn them inside the trade depot
[2022-12-21 15:41:11] <%$Panderrific> yeah, my mayor is obsessed with coffins and mail shirts, and wont let me sell either
[2022-12-21 15:41:14] <+TheEggBeard> I assume the plural of i is i, like sheep.
[2022-12-21 15:41:18] <%KaldrisRelm> Preferably with the traders inside
[2022-12-21 15:41:22] <%$CarloTheCurious> bloody tree huggers
[2022-12-21 15:41:24] <%+The_Dakta> for the memes
[2022-12-21 15:41:24] <brrrako> because elves aren't dwarves
[2022-12-21 15:41:26] <%+inakleinbottle> They're the natural enemies of dwarves
[2022-12-21 15:41:28] <critiqa> Roleplaying as a dwarf demands elf hating

[2022-12-21 15:41:36] <%agravicvoid> You can’t trade anything that comes from animals, and you can’t trade wood
[2022-12-21 15:41:37] <+slippry_john> Those are our trees
[2022-12-21 15:41:37] <%MarnikRong101> Damn filthy pointyears
[2022-12-21 15:41:44] <%Silvertunga> Something about dwarves and elves hating each other because Tolkien is not fantasy, it's law?
[2022-12-21 15:41:45] <%SillyZili> Elves are yucky
[2022-12-21 15:41:47] <SADEyX> yea, Elves best traders
[2022-12-21 15:41:50] <darkwolfn1> elves eat their cereal with water
[2022-12-21 15:41:50] <%+Balodek> It's because their beer tastes like water
[2022-12-21 15:41:51] <+IamCaffy> Sell them your wood crafts, they love that
[2022-12-21 15:41:52] <brrrako> just look at them with their flimsy wooden armor, the bastards
[2022-12-21 15:41:58] <%Brynjarbjorn> Dwarves don't like cooties.
[2022-12-21 15:41:59] <usgrethontwitch> elves are hypocrites, they eat sentient beings
[2022-12-21 15:42:02] <%AkumiOnBass> happy wednesday kiriDance kiriDance
[2022-12-21 15:42:06] <%+The_Dakta> I was about to make a trade with elves the other day that would have net them thousands in profit but I accidentally selected a scroll too, so they told me to go die
[2022-12-21 15:42:13] <%KaldrisRelm> Can we somehow flood the Trade Depot and drown the Elves?
[2022-12-21 15:42:15] <%grugenvids> Filthy leaf overs. NODDERS SoSnowy
[2022-12-21 15:42:20] <sir_metalanarchie> When you dont hate Elves you propoly a spy !
[2022-12-21 15:42:22] <%agravicvoid> I tried to trade them wool and they were like “we see you revel in death and now we refuse to trade with you”
[2022-12-21 15:42:25] <The_Holas> they dont drink DansGame and thinks they are above us DansGame
[2022-12-21 15:42:33] <%agravicvoid> Wool. From a sheep. The sheep is FINE
[2022-12-21 15:42:51] <%KaldrisRelm> I'm sure he won't mind if you matter smash it
[2022-12-21 15:42:52] <%+The_Dakta> @agravicvoid was it in a wooden bin? Because I think they only have an issue with wooden items
[2022-12-21 15:43:08] <darkwolfn1> 'we misplaced another mayor. new elections!'
[2022-12-21 15:43:15] <usgrethontwitch> the mayor can't ban the export of anything if he/she stops being mayor, just saying
[2022-12-21 15:43:15] <ForeverMash> Elves eschew stone, the prime material to craft with. They praise wood, rather than use it as kindling for the great forges.
[2022-12-21 15:43:16] <static_electro> @agravicvoid they pobably saw the dead ticks in that wool
[2022-12-21 15:43:16] <%agravicvoid> @the_dakta no bin, just wool haha
[2022-12-21 15:43:18] <brrrako> I think it has a lot to do with the huge pain it is to trade with elves
[2022-12-21 15:43:21] <%KaldrisRelm> Elves have had a hand in way too many of my Dwarf fortress deaths to be friendly to them
[2022-12-21 15:43:30] <%KaldrisRelm> *hand in destroying
[2022-12-21 15:43:33] <+uncivlengr> probably because of Tolkein

[2022-12-21 15:43:37] <+MisterAvry> hello good morning everyone!
[2022-12-21 15:43:42] <%wombatwhole> moohooEnceladus EarthDay
[2022-12-21 15:43:52] <an0k_> Isn't the bin wood?
[2022-12-21 15:44:10] <%$Panderrific> ya, dwarves and elves have classically never gotten along, gimli and legolas were an exception to the rule
[2022-12-21 15:44:11] <+IamCaffy> Why you trying to defend those treehuggers Kiri?
[2022-12-21 15:44:32] <%SillyZili> You can transport items in bins to elves, but just don't trade the bins :D
[2022-12-21 15:44:46] <Rogxu> they might have used the eggs automatically?
[2022-12-21 15:44:47] <+TheEggBeard> I hate how annoying bins make trading, even if you set up proper stockpiles.
[2022-12-21 15:44:48] <%agravicvoid> I mean that’s another reason I’m addicted to this game, everything is extreme, dwarves have to be constantly drunk, and elves are pretentious and they can sell you wood but will call you evil if you try to do the same
[2022-12-21 15:44:56] <+TheEggBeard> Just let us order by value of items ignoring bins.
[2022-12-21 15:44:58] <an0k_> ah ok, makes sense
[2022-12-21 15:45:03] <%$Panderrific> @SillyZili okay this is helpful... not that they ever have anything worth buying lol
[2022-12-21 15:45:03] <%$CarloTheCurious> no, no, let Kiri try to trade the forbidden stuff, so she too can learn the proper attitude towards elves! :)
[2022-12-21 15:45:04] <usgrethontwitch> -if- you did have too many mail shirts from mayors mandates, you could also melt them down to get some metal back
[2022-12-21 15:45:05] <+MisterAvry> I made the elves mad the other day because I didn't know they don't like bones.
[2022-12-21 15:45:09] <%+The_Dakta> @agravicvoid tbf, their wooden items are grown and gifted that way.

[2022-12-21 15:45:44] <usgrethontwitch> @CarloTheCurious and to how cuddly war pandas are
[2022-12-21 15:45:48] <@%2DKiriBot> Remember to clip funny moments. They go into clip compilations for YT kiriCool
[2022-12-21 15:46:02] <brrrako> it's not just wood, it's anything living like plants / cloth / leather / bones
[2022-12-21 15:46:12] <%agravicvoid> It sucks cause then they refuse to trade and just sit there taunting you with their stuff
[2022-12-21 15:46:16] <ForeverMash> I champion the dwarf-elf feud because it allows for stories creating friendships forged beyond said hatred, which I really love.
[2022-12-21 15:46:21] <%+VoodooLilium> kiriHi
[2022-12-21 15:46:21] <%$Panderrific> yeah butchering of any innocent creatures, which includes trees
[2022-12-21 15:46:21] <%KaldrisRelm> Anything that came from something living
[2022-12-21 15:46:22] <+MisterAvry> Cloth?! jeez
[2022-12-21 15:46:27] <%SillyZili> To be honest, Elves are easy to kill if you have a full armoured/trained military up. They wear wooden armour and things LUL
[2022-12-21 15:46:41] <+Fauxwise> Trees are never innocent, those fiends
[2022-12-21 15:46:45] <usgrethontwitch> if you have a stone object decorated with leather, they will still flip out
[2022-12-21 15:46:52] <+TheEggBeard> @SillyZili Elves have been buffed in the Steam Version
[2022-12-21 15:47:05] <%$Panderrific> @SillyZili how many units would you say is a full military? i have 1 metal, 1 leather, 1 ranged.. is that enough?
[2022-12-21 15:47:08] <usgrethontwitch> @SillyZili the elves themselves, the pandas were no joke
[2022-12-21 15:47:10] <%KaldrisRelm> I think my next base may incorporate a floor drop trap that dumps any incoming elves into lava pits
[2022-12-21 15:47:12] <%multiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii> trees have killed enough of my dwarves to not even nearly count as innocent
[2022-12-21 15:47:30] <Rogxu> he did, someone else will transport it
[2022-12-21 15:47:30] <ForeverMash> @SillyZili Every dwarf serves the military. Some simply serve more.

[2022-12-21 15:47:39] <+TheEggBeard> @multiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii The tree has a pretty solid case of self defence against you.
[2022-12-21 15:47:58] <%$Panderrific> chat, can big wagons navigate ramps?
[2022-12-21 15:48:18] <%SillyZili> @SillyZili No need for much variety tbh, I just chuck all my Dwaves in metal armour and change weapons to suit. (Usually either spears or crossbows)
[2022-12-21 15:48:24] <%KaldrisRelm> As long as it's 3x3 I believe
[2022-12-21 15:48:25] <p3rilous3d> two wide
[2022-12-21 15:48:25] <+MisterAvry> yes if the ramps are wide enough
[2022-12-21 15:49:07] <ForeverMash> Look at that flashing Alert button. Kappa
[2022-12-21 15:49:16] <ForeverMash> Must be the elves up to their elven tricks.

[2022-12-21 15:50:48] <+MisterAvry> Can you do diplomacy with the elves and ask them to bring specific stuff? Their random grab bag of animals is always hard to get breeding pairs

[2022-12-21 15:52:07] <+TheEggBeard> You should purchase as much as possible and then give them enough to make "trader profit" into the green, that makes them happier with you and bring you more stuff next time.... BUT it does attract attention to your fort from others who want your wealth

[2022-12-21 16:04:31] <+TheEggBeard> I had a monster slayer solo kill a forgotten beast without even getting injured
[2022-12-21 16:04:31] <%Silvertunga> Have you seen any monsters since they showed up? No? Then obviously it works!
[2022-12-21 16:04:59] <+Vinyl_Rabbit> are you down in the cavern layers yet
[2022-12-21 16:05:10] <+crazyhobbitman> Monster hunters need an open path to the cavern to go down and hunt.

[2022-12-21 16:05:55] <+TheEggBeard> You can also expel the ones that you notice are constantly in the tavern and not in the caverns

[2022-12-21 16:06:32] <critiqa> The only bummer for me in this game is the lack of ambiance. Hearing someone mining or cooking...
[2022-12-21 16:07:01] <%+The_Dakta> can't they not break objects that are not on the same z-level as them, so the hatches should pretty much do it?
[2022-12-21 16:07:09] <usgrethontwitch> artifact door would be handy
[2022-12-21 16:07:09] <%KaldrisRelm> @2DKiri Since you have two bridges just always have one closed, use an airlock design
[2022-12-21 16:07:15] <+crazyhobbitman> If you are worried about getting to the drawbridge levers in time you can put them near your main base.
[2022-12-21 16:07:28] <toktok_woktok> @p3rilous3d : the bees started flying again this week, bc its gotten so warm. there's no flowers, ofc, so most of them will die. climate change really sucks :(
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <+bjmunise> @KaldrisRelm the problem is the monster hunters not going to hunt monsters bc the path isn't open
[2022-12-21 16:07:40] <+Vinyl_Rabbit> put the levers up in the gathering areas not down near the bridges so the dwarves sent to throw them dont get killed before they can throw the switch

[2022-12-21 16:08:56] <+MisterAvry> it's sealed down tho
[2022-12-21 16:09:03] <+Vinyl_Rabbit> yes that is a design flaw

[2022-12-21 16:09:20] <ForeverMash> If the monster can't break down constructions, you shouldn't worry about them. If it can, a gate won't help.

[2022-12-21 16:46:00] <%$Panderrific> you could have your basics, like 1 barrel, 1 bin, 50 coal, all collapsed into one at the top, then smithing in another, smelting in another, and individual orders just loose at the end
[2022-12-21 16:46:24] <Rogxu> keep in mind making something out of metal requires the coal to make the bar + the coal to make the item

[2022-12-21 17:11:33] <brrrako> is it a constructed stair? try channel then
[2022-12-21 17:12:02] VIEWERS: 435
[2022-12-21 17:12:11] <brrrako> ah yeah, have to build adjacent to the tile, can't build diagonally
[2022-12-21 17:12:14] <%eF_eX> this is one of those games where i have the fear that an entire year will be gone if i start playing
[2022-12-21 17:12:14] <%$Panderrific> .....so they can move diagonally, but not build diagonally
[2022-12-21 17:12:39] <%$Panderrific> okay thats a fun quirk
[2022-12-21 17:12:48] <%+The_Dakta> @eF_eX literally didn't do any work on Monday, just played DF while "on the clock"

[2022-12-21 17:13:05] <brrrako> you want to do the diagonal first
[2022-12-21 17:13:20] <DiamondDestructe> that should work now

[2022-12-21 17:29:01] <kippawah> My first year on the first embark on the steam version, I had a dwarven child drown in a nearby fishing pool. Her body was unrecoverable, and so she terrorised her parents and siblings as a ghost, until I was able to make a memorial slab for her. That seemed to put an end to her hauntings. I later was able to mine out the frozen water to recover her bones for interring.

[2022-12-21 17:52:46] <+toon2k> watching it first is a good way to get into the game i think
[2022-12-21 17:53:09] <%$CarloTheCurious> th1sRIP is from a streamer called Nancy. Who hasn't streamed in ages :)
[2022-12-21 17:53:25] <+toon2k> you can limit the population in the options. I think the standard is 200
[2022-12-21 17:53:31] <N8tefal> you learn it with trail and error

[2022-12-21 17:54:32] <Sitiran> Losing is Fun
[2022-12-21 17:54:34] <subparumpire> And thats OK
[2022-12-21 17:54:35] <bayerii> I wanted to get into Dwarf Fortress so bad back in 2012 or so because I loved the aesthetic of it. But my middle school brain was unable to grasp any of the systems LUL
[2022-12-21 17:54:39] <mad_wack> peculiar is a good way to put it

[2022-12-21 17:55:26] <%$CarloTheCurious> playthrough, even
[2022-12-21 17:55:26] <%$Panderrific> i feel like losing in DF is the main place where the stories might come from
[2022-12-21 17:55:50] <bayerii> I'm in love with it now. Playing Rimworld first was definitely a nice bridge
[2022-12-21 17:55:52] <subparumpire> Losing is the game, once you figure everything out there isn't much to do
[2022-12-21 17:56:00] <Valentin_PV> I heard someone say in another chat: "Rimworld is a game you play. Dward Fortress is a machine. You are a cog in that machine, and the machine will eventually break you" :D
[2022-12-21 17:56:05] <+uncivlengr> haven't played the steam version, apparently you can't advance time frame y frame anymore?

[2022-12-21 17:56:38] <%$CarloTheCurious> @uncivlengr I haven't tried them, but I did see some workarounds posted on reddit
[2022-12-21 17:56:45] <+uncivlengr> that was always critical to being sure you were doing what you expected
[2022-12-21 17:57:01] <Sitiran> I remember a comment years back that the DF learning curve make EVE Online look like a perfect 45° slope
[2022-12-21 17:57:03] <subparumpire> Advance tick by tick
[2022-12-21 17:57:05] <+uncivlengr> frame by frame, one "tick" at a time
[2022-12-21 17:57:21] <%$CarloTheCurious> generally useful for combat more than anything else
[2022-12-21 17:57:23] <%$Panderrific> you can adjust game rate with alt -/+

[2022-12-21 17:58:24] <%$CarloTheCurious> only if you never dismiss the notification
[2022-12-21 17:58:30] <Pagrax> I always found the term learning curve strange. Mathematically, a steep learning curve means something is easier to learn. Shallow learning curves are actually more difficult. But in English, steep is difficult and shallow is easy.
[2022-12-21 17:58:31] <Shagiwog> you could watch it live before
[2022-12-21 17:58:34] <subparumpire> I find it kind of unbelievable there is no combat log accessible after the fact
[2022-12-21 17:58:57] <%$CarloTheCurious> The combats logs (actually, all logs) used to be separately accessible live & historically
[2022-12-21 17:59:01] <Pagrax> A learning curve is knowledge vs time. Steep means the line goes up faster, aka you get more knowledge sooner.
[2022-12-21 17:59:04] <+uncivlengr> steep learning curve is like climbing a steeper hill
[2022-12-21 17:59:10] <+Cameron_Paxton> Yeah, that's not accurate
[2022-12-21 17:59:15] <%$Panderrific> @Pagrax its harder to walk up a sharp slope than a gentle hill
[2022-12-21 17:59:16] <%DnDMonty> !lol
[2022-12-21 17:59:21] <Ramiel01> apparently trees can grow beneath animals

[2022-12-21 17:59:37] <Rogxu> I had that issue with dwarves... running away from danger (birds)
[2022-12-21 17:59:41] <Valentin_PV> @Pagrax I think the axes are difficulty vs time
[2022-12-21 17:59:56] <Pagrax> @Panderrific Yes, I totally get why it is that way in English. But a learning curve is represented as a graph in math, and the faster the line goes up the easier a game is to learn. So grammar vs math is different. Just a silly thing is all.
[2022-12-21 17:59:56] <mad_wack> i keep my pastures underground in the soil layer... they can graze there if you've breached the caverns at least once
[2022-12-21 17:59:56] <bagofholding> how do the elves put up with all those trees?
[2022-12-21 18:00:01] <TactfulKook> OK so I have a horde of Giant bushtits running amok in my fort
[2022-12-21 18:00:03] <subparumpire> @Pagrax Its not linearly steep
[2022-12-21 18:00:05] <static_electro> and THAT is why dwarves hate trees... and elves...
[2022-12-21 18:00:11] VIEWERS: 505
[2022-12-21 18:00:42] <%$Panderrific> @Pagrax yeah like @Valentin_PV thats more of a time to learn thing, as opposed to ease of learning
[2022-12-21 18:00:42] <Ginmaru> if horizontal is time spent and vertical is knowledge of the game, then in a steep learning curve you spend less time to get more knowledge, that's the falacy

[2022-12-21 18:00:48] <TactfulKook> I wish I had cages, these things seem amazing
[2022-12-21 18:00:54] <Valentin_PV> @Pagrax so instead of knowledge vs time, it's difficulty to absorb the knowledge vs time
[2022-12-21 18:01:14] <+uncivlengr> yeah it's a learning curve not a knowledge curve
[2022-12-21 18:01:17] <Rogxu> you can allow the bolts to be picked up outside siege time
[2022-12-21 18:01:18] <%$CarloTheCurious> most designations things work across multiple layers, or used to (burrows don't in this version, for some reason)
[2022-12-21 18:01:21] <+Cameron_Paxton> Not sure where you're getting time from
[2022-12-21 18:01:21] <mad_wack> there's a standing order to claim used ammo automatically
[2022-12-21 18:01:24] <Valentin_PV> though iti's a figure of speech, so it's never been accurately defined
[2022-12-21 18:01:28] <subparumpire> @Ginmaru The line is exponential when its steep
[2022-12-21 18:01:28] <+Cameron_Paxton> It's effort/knowledge
[2022-12-21 18:01:34] <bayerii> birbsNotes time.. horizontal.. knowledge... eep!
[2022-12-21 18:01:35] <icosaeder> Unforbid bolts to have dwarves pick them up while they're still in the living enemy EZ
[2022-12-21 18:01:36] <Pagrax> @Valentin_PV Sure, that just isn't represented on an actual learning curve graph. Just something silly, is all.
[2022-12-21 18:01:42] <Rogxu> it doesnt work for bolts already there
[2022-12-21 18:01:43] <Rogxu> but for new bolts it does
[2022-12-21 18:01:43] <%Brynjarbjorn> More is learned over a shorter time, sure but you have to learn more of it to progress through the curve.
[2022-12-21 18:01:57] <Shagiwog> there is an option somewhere to pick the bolts up?
[2022-12-21 18:02:00] <mad_wack> should work all the time going forward
[2022-12-21 18:02:04] <Rogxu> go to siege

I am beginning to realize in this game, my own playthru, that im going to need multiple of the same kinds of workstations to do muiltiple things. this is going to be a huge undertaking
[2022-12-21 18:02:13] <Rogxu> its a button... ;)
[2022-12-21 18:02:13] <Valentin_PV> @Pagrax yeah, language do be silly
[2022-12-21 18:02:27] <Rogxu> claim used ammo.. ok its ok.. but you have to unlock all the bolts that are on the field now
[2022-12-21 18:02:28] <subparumpire> We need to be talking about whether the learning curve is exponential or logarithmic
[2022-12-21 18:02:31] <mad_wack> do it harder
[2022-12-21 18:02:31] <%illmryn> you can change it from "forbid during siege" to just "not be forbidden
[2022-12-21 18:02:49] <%illmryn> oh. i thought that would fix it. derp
[2022-12-21 18:02:54] <mad_wack> yeah sounds buggy
[2022-12-21 18:02:57] <%$CarloTheCurious> maybe bugged then. It used to work :)
[2022-12-21 18:03:03] <brrrako> you don't want to collect your bolts anyway, when they get covered in blood, they'll stack only in singles in your bins
[2022-12-21 18:03:22] <Rogxu> ad.. but its working for me, maybe some of the bolts (bone?) are seen as refuge ?
[2022-12-21 18:03:34] <DeFactoDeJure> mjlBounce mjlPog
[2022-12-21 18:03:40] <Rogxu> you can unlock them faster from the stocks menu

[2022-12-21 18:03:54] <%$CarloTheCurious> forbid and unforbid do still work across multiple z-levels

[2022-12-21 18:21:23] <%Oskatatv2> in the game settings somewhere, I forgot exactly where. It says 'max population' I think, also lets you set it so you won't get new babies when for example you already have 2 children for every adult

[2022-12-21 18:28:45] <Pagrax> I never understood why people give dwarves 1x1 closets as a room, space is basically infinite you may as well cut them decent rooms and make them happy.

[2022-12-21 18:29:32] <%$CarloTheCurious> @Pagrax it's not infinite if you want to keep within a certain design (e.g. a tower). But mostly it's just quicker (I usually use 2x3 though)

[2022-12-21 18:49:57] <Rogxu> think you have to assign diagnostician in the hospital
[2022-12-21 18:50:22] VIEWERS: 436
[2022-12-21 18:50:30] <mad_wack> you need to assign the chief medical dwarf as a doctor
[2022-12-21 18:50:33] <+hyfrydle> It speeds things up if you do
[2022-12-21 18:50:37] <mad_wack> and then you're gucci
[2022-12-21 18:50:49] <mad_wack> yep

[2022-12-21 18:54:59] <dev_spajus> hey! the space ship is going strong, but we landed here for some dwarfs :)
[2022-12-21 18:55:20] <mad_wack> orderlies will do basic stuff like dressing
[2022-12-21 18:55:27] <%+mattress_wolf> I AM THE DOCTOR
[2022-12-21 18:55:28] <mad_wack> and by default the whole fort is orderlies
[2022-12-21 18:55:33] <%$Panderrific> you can also assign orderlies, but thats everyone by default
[2022-12-21 18:55:42] <+uncivlengr> "I'm a bookkeeper, not a doctor!"
[2022-12-21 18:55:44] <destroyercromatic> the last 2 minutes of gameplay here so perfectly embody my entire relationship with this game

[2022-12-21 18:58:03] <%SillyZili> Orderlies will also feed and give water to those in hospitals
[2022-12-21 18:58:08] <%SillyZili> So better of leaving it as it is tbh
[2022-12-21 18:58:24] <mad_wack> they dress wounds, wash patients, etc

[2022-12-21 18:58:52] <%$Panderrific> once you have some people getting good at it you can specialise them as orderlies, set them as nurses in the hospital zone

[2022-12-21 19:01:19] <%shunoshi> If you look at your civilization on the map screen it should say what they wanted.
[2022-12-21 19:01:19] <Knicpaw> If I may, I saw a tip on a different stream... to find out past trade "requests", go to world map and hover/right-click (?not sure) on your colony

[2022-12-21 19:01:46] <%SillyZili> @RezaDarkside Truth LUL
[2022-12-21 19:01:53] <Bostonmeadhorn> Bavaria and Austria would be a more reasonable country then having Bayern in Deutschland
[2022-12-21 19:01:56] <%$Panderrific> you can mouseover yourself on the civilisations list for that too
[2022-12-21 19:01:59] <%+mattress_wolf> it is if you'tr a tourist @RezaDarkside
[2022-12-21 19:02:03] <%$Panderrific> but it clears once they arrive for trade

[2022-12-21 19:02:34] <mad_wack> this cracks me up every time
[2022-12-21 19:02:36] <Shagiwog> it's the green one. or maybe blue :)
[2022-12-21 19:02:37] <Rogxu> one of the grey forts
[2022-12-21 19:02:37] <%+ListlessOnion> It has a yellow highlight around it
[2022-12-21 19:02:45] <Rogxu> more top-left
[2022-12-21 19:02:50] <%$Panderrific> yeah i think its coz you were close to the other blues when you settled on the zoomed in version, so they overlap you on this zoomed out view
[2022-12-21 19:02:53] <Rogxu> (maybe)?
[2022-12-21 19:02:56] <%shunoshi> You can click on the Civilizations button on the right and look at your civ, it'll show what they want.
[2022-12-21 19:02:59] <!%RezaDarkside> there is no yellow!
[2022-12-21 19:03:06] <%+ListlessOnion> Yellow highlight
[2022-12-21 19:03:12] <%$Panderrific> bring up civilisations list on top right and you see the trade deals on mouseover.... until they show up to trade :(
[2022-12-21 19:03:13] <%SillyZili> Yikes lmao
[2022-12-21 19:03:25] <Knicpaw> green in center with wooded square?

[2022-12-21 19:03:32] <%SillyZili> If you left click on the map, I think it zooms in?
[2022-12-21 19:03:35] <Scytale3> If you don't know, maybe the goblins don't know either...
[2022-12-21 19:03:47] <%$Panderrific> sadly the agreements end when they show up to trade

[2022-12-21 19:09:54] <Pagrax> I linked your VoD of embarking.
[2022-12-21 19:10:00] <%$Panderrific> i think the zoomed in map might just be missing from this version?
