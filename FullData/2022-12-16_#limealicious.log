[2022-12-16 21:10:10] <+denizium> did you do the ini file tweak to ACTUALLY disable the rtx? it likes to stay on even when you turn it off in the game itself
[2022-12-16 21:10:11] <@%Kovubot> Interested in supporting Limealicious and getting some heckin' cute merch limesAw ? Check it out here! https://teespring.com/stores/limealicious .

[2022-12-16 21:11:41] <+RaZor92P> I bought it on Steam since I was going to anyway and the gamepass version is more likely to end up dead
[2022-12-16 21:11:46] <%+Hedobot> @ghost_mira that would be nice
[2022-12-16 21:11:51] <+denizium> wait are you serious?

[2022-12-16 21:12:18] <+ghost_mira> the gampass version is an update behind because of microsoft regulations

[2022-12-16 21:12:31] <+ghost_mira> so cross play cant work until updates arent so frequent

[2022-12-16 21:12:44] <+RaZor92P> The gamepass version is much less populated already from what I know

[2022-12-16 21:13:23] <+denizium> gamepass would be less populated especially if it doesn't have xbox crossplay
[2022-12-16 21:13:23] <+ghost_mira> The gamepass version was unplayable for the first ~2 days after release, so anyone that REALLY wanted to play probably went to steam
[2022-12-16 21:13:23] <%Ballermar> I hope they add a skiitari class at some point.  I wanna be a sorta tech priest

[2022-12-16 23:52:20] <%AK_Zephyr> just plan on 200 :)

[2022-12-16 23:52:53] <Wayback2k> @Limealicious  Trick I use to count them is un map one bedroom, and then drag a multi over the whooooole thing to see how many dupe beds it doesnt count
[2022-12-16 23:52:55] <Justjake274> laimubot will be back, when we are in greatest need of her

[2022-12-16 23:56:01] <stochastic_guy> IIRC if you have enough followers of a given god then you specialize the temples?
[2022-12-16 23:56:02] <!%Laimubot> How is it another slang
[2022-12-16 23:56:03] <Yleshphitrium> Temples for the main dwarven gods are nice

[2022-12-16 23:56:24] <Wayback2k> I did that, overlapped a bunch of temples to different Gods on the same large and fancy temple room. Some still get really cranky though

[2022-12-16 23:57:12] <$GoutetsuKame> can we have a temple to the god of wine and tits?
[2022-12-16 23:57:32] <ionlich> Inexperienced smelters are also really slow

[2022-12-16 23:57:34] <AlmondRoll> more wheelbarrows might help, rocks are slow to haul
[2022-12-16 23:57:47] <+JJBob1234> I think the forges need lava near them don't they?
[2022-12-16 23:57:56] <%AK_Zephyr> make sure you are adjusting the stockpile to allow more than one
[2022-12-16 23:57:59] <jonnazar> @Limealicious the workshops produce much slower down if they are cluttered
[2022-12-16 23:58:00] <%+Snackteeth> Might be worth making a minecart system to automate some of that mine retrieval!
[2022-12-16 23:58:02] <%$RubixN00B> create a nearby set of small, individual, high-priority storage areas near the crafting zones

[2022-12-16 23:58:46] <%AK_Zephyr> 6 wood burners : 2 Smelters : 2 Forges seems to be the ideal ration for me
