[2022-12-16 00:00:07] <%ow_sigmaeats> @bogur WINTON
[2022-12-16 00:00:09] <%+Austintooclutch_> Its Winton
[2022-12-16 00:00:09] <fazefireskull0> kiriko in plat 2 W or L i dont play a lot
[2022-12-16 00:00:10] <+nictiss> @rizz_goat I know man im just holding my tears rn
[2022-12-16 00:00:12] <Rollo156> @therealsabertooth slightly harder to one clip? Thats all i assume really
[2022-12-16 00:00:18] <Espher_5> COPIUM rein buffs
[2022-12-16 00:00:19] <therealsabertooth> @nickuhfoster wym supposed sweet spot?
[2022-12-16 00:00:20] <rizz_goat> @therealsabertooth I don't know, tbh I'm also new so idk either
[2022-12-16 00:00:24] <+Sabertore> Yo everyone MLADY just saw the patch video, holy shit POGGIES
[2022-12-16 00:00:24] <%basssskitty> @basssskitty maybe that person had a rough tank on ow1 KEKW
[2022-12-16 00:00:25] <WhoIsBio> fixed pin hitbox and 100 dmg fire strike???
[2022-12-16 00:00:25] <l3monyfresh> @therealsabertooth tracer has a high rate of fire and lots of bullets per clip, so 0.5 per bullet adds up
[2022-12-16 00:00:28] <Dawnveu> god please give Rein some love
[2022-12-16 00:00:28] <gamesetmatch> that earlier was called a boopdown
[2022-12-16 00:00:31] <HYDROFTW28> Hey flats why are most streamers moving to quick play instead of playing comp? I think I know why but i just wanna know if I’m right or not
[2022-12-16 00:00:34] <lesbianhentai> did you know if Mercy and Genji wave at eachother hanzo and Cassidy will kiss
[2022-12-16 00:00:35] <!%bogur> no i didnt, i was too busy having my day ruined by roadhog players in ranked
[2022-12-16 00:00:35] <%+pandamension> @bogur rein will get a buff to firestrike
[2022-12-16 00:00:37] <%SirTryhard7> Does speed boost heal with amp?
[2022-12-16 00:00:38] <%+Austintooclutch_> LOL HOG lmaoooooooo
[2022-12-16 00:00:41] <DevsRad> @therealsabertooth it may seem a small number but it adds up, u could be missing tons of dmg, droplets make ocean
[2022-12-16 00:00:41] <%Silvr_Xelz> did they talk about junker queen?
[2022-12-16 00:00:43] <Chan_OW> LOOK
[2022-12-16 00:00:43] <hasturthebarrel> KEKW
[2022-12-16 00:00:46] <+ScottySimppin> @Flats we know you bartered for Rein buffs in that interview MonkaHmm
[2022-12-16 00:00:49] <%+Austintooclutch_> Didn't get nerfed in this patch.
[2022-12-16 00:00:49] <UgsHavard> @therealsabertooth she unloads a whole clip insanely fast. that's .5 less per shot. it's like 20 less damage per clip so she one clips less characters and has to hit all the shots
[2022-12-16 00:00:53] <fantabi> @fazefireskull0 try to poke as much as possible whilst still healing from time to time what u can do is flank because u can climb walls then if ur in danger just tp to someone and make sure to suzu cleanse when u can to save team from dying

[2022-12-16 00:00:58] <+dethwishh> Is that common practice, switching auras so quickly on Lucio? (I suck with him)
[2022-12-16 00:01:06] <rizz_goat> @hydroftw28 becuase ranked is not fun ,the way  the system works isn't
[2022-12-16 00:01:13] <%ow_sigmaeats> @silvr_xelz jq is most likely getting a buff
[2022-12-16 00:01:13] <sbfg_mysteryyt> Dropgang
[2022-12-16 00:01:17] <kjngam> @dethwishh yeah cause the healing heals a bit lnonger when you swap

[2022-12-16 00:01:30] <Christigious> @flats r you gonna post a vid on the patch notes on what you think
[2022-12-16 00:01:32] <%+backsonjeck> the rare flats lucio 😧😧😧
[2022-12-16 00:01:40] <WhoIsBio> @dethwishh the boost/heals both have a lingering effect for a small time period so if you crossfade a lot you can essentially have both
[2022-12-16 00:01:43] <%$TeaHauss> @Christigious already posted on flats2
[2022-12-16 00:01:44] <bigsloth8346> su0

[2022-12-16 00:01:45] <%basssskitty> knowing me if I was lucio I'd just trip over a pebble KEKW
[2022-12-16 00:01:46] <bigsloth8346> sup
[2022-12-16 00:01:46] <+kianmd> @dethwishh Yeah if you watch the best lucios they swap a lot
[2022-12-16 00:01:49] <+dethwishh> @kjngam thanks for the pro tip
[2022-12-16 00:01:59] <rizz_goat> @christigious he already did like 3 hours ago on his 2nd channel
[2022-12-16 00:01:59] <!%bogur> ramattra is gonna be meta
[2022-12-16 00:02:00] <+karatena_> i see your more of a grucio then a lucio
[2022-12-16 00:02:00] <!%bogur> which is funny
[2022-12-16 00:02:02] <+perplaxus_> !patch
[2022-12-16 00:02:02] <worldnotending> @dethwishh little speed boosts make you more unpredictable and harder to hit as well
[2022-12-16 00:02:02] <@%^StreamElements> New balance patch is out NOW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W3MO9tS938
[2022-12-16 00:02:19] <DevsRad> orisa is probably the best tank right now
[2022-12-16 00:02:20] <%basssskitty> you gonna play him bogur? PauseChamp
[2022-12-16 00:02:24] <!%bogur> orisa and hog will be meta tanks probably until people learn how to play ram
[2022-12-16 00:02:27] <+Sabertore> KEKW

[2022-12-16 00:03:33] <saxifragous> the problem is orisa also shits on rein, so he is not playable still

[2022-12-16 00:03:53] <jaythebearduk> has orissa been buffed now
[2022-12-16 00:04:15] <nasty_pasta_> maybe Plat 2 lucio.

[2022-12-16 00:04:29] <saxifragous> @maximasapientia yes, ive had to alt f4 a couple times because of it
[2022-12-16 00:04:31] <spectreadept> @therealsabertoot The 0.5 could be the difference between Tracer having her to reload again or her killing you in one clip.

[2022-12-16 00:04:42] <%Keystone4274> Did you know that torb can heal bastion with his hammer because he made him
[2022-12-16 00:04:47] <%$jasonwocky> Soldier's gonna be meta because he can run away from Rammatra and that's the most important thing now, I can feel it
[2022-12-16 00:04:49] <maximasapientia> @maximasapientia Restart the computer?

[2022-12-16 00:05:56] <NuDimon> @ScottySimppin Mei wall is not classified as a barrier, so it shouldn't
[2022-12-16 00:06:09] <+NotBradAce> Why does he constantly switch between healing and speed? Is it more efficient/optimal?
[2022-12-16 00:06:13] <maximasapientia> @maximasapientia Sure can do that, by the way ivve seen on the forums that many have experienced this.
[2022-12-16 00:06:16] <Graysog> how come it says stuck for cass and not bastion
[2022-12-16 00:06:17] <jacob22w> OMFG
[2022-12-16 00:06:20] <+dethwishh> @skeeterbeater0 plat 3 support here and I’ve been playing up too. Was wondering if this was normal
[2022-12-16 00:06:23] <@%flyingfish1230> @NotBradAce crossfading provides a little bit of both heals and speed

[2022-12-16 20:37:46] <Zadriar> i think i missed like a huge part of OW balance cos all of a sudden everyone just hated on roadhogs one hit, never bothered me but since the change to 5v5 it seems more prominent

[2022-12-16 20:52:11] <thegreenhill95> Ramattra has a voice line where he calls our rein for charging in "by all means keep charging in"
[2022-12-16 20:52:14] <+ZacNZL> why couldn't they find a good middle ground for doom now hes trash again

[2022-12-16 23:16:02] <+Ferixstar> Just to share my experience today (in case it helps someone): For this specific drop, Twitch Mobile  wouldn’t show me any progress or let me claim it on mobile. I couldn’t even find details on this drop when on mobile. It’s like it didn’t exist. But as soon as I logged into Twitch on a PC, it showed me the progress that it had recorded while I was mobile, and let me claim the drop. So for peace of mind: your mobile viewing is counting toward the drop even if you can’t see it.

I could be totally wrong thats why i asked but i wont ask anything again i just wont watch lol. Tilted off a toxic loss
[2022-12-16 23:34:24] <%$TeaHauss> Chat, flats will do more bronze spectating 1) the less people ask and 2) the more people ACTUALLY follow the rules
[2022-12-16 23:34:24] <diellixo> just let top 500 be 5 stack pro players
[2022-12-16 23:34:28] <%laznick_stone> Why that’s dumb

[2022-12-16 23:39:38] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
