[2022-12-08 20:18:08] <%nog00d4u> @willerz I have a lot of experience with fiber stuff.  You will see crews running cable either overhead or boring underground days or even weeks before the house is connected.  They gotta get the cable from their head-in to your casa.  These installs are typically done by contractors, not the major provider. Drive around and look for obvious work happening nearby.  That’s gonna give you an idea of how far out your are.
[2022-12-08 20:18:08] <%+joycenothing> Should have brought the PP ammo

[2022-12-08 20:42:51] <+Syntr_ox> A DMA (Direct Memory Access) card is a hardware device that allows a computer to transfer data directly from one device to another without involving the CPU. This allows for faster data transfer speeds and frees up the CPU to perform other tasks. DMA is commonly used in devices such as hard drives and network cards

[2022-12-08 23:50:55] <%Alphaw> @tobexi Customs is always best to learn but lots of pvp
[2022-12-08 23:50:58] <%+HereComestheWoooooo> when I slowed it to .25 it looks like he just tackles you after saying sorry
[2022-12-08 23:51:04] <justbrighthammer> in the clip it looked like he knifed you

[2022-12-08 23:51:48] <+PuppetMaster176> @tobexi some people will say customs, but i dont agree. mid-late wipe everyone goes there just to pvp so we chase every gunshot lol. id say woods or lighthouse. both can get you a lot of rubles and can avoid other players.
[2022-12-08 23:51:50] <%T_RAN> he did the cod finisher

[2022-12-08 23:52:00] <%Alphaw> @tobexi still customs, because majority of your quests stem from here. You should try to learn in offline mode with scavs on
[2022-12-08 23:52:01] <Vaski__> j_actual88 hahahaha "sorry boss :' "
[2022-12-08 23:52:05] <wtfPANDA_ttv> he was in tent i think to your left

[2022-12-08 23:52:48] <+PuppetMaster176> @Alphaw its good for quests but leaning the basics of the game, not questing, its a hard map for the reason i stated
[2022-12-08 23:52:49] <%Alphaw> Im expecting a tweet from BSG tonight announcing

[2022-12-08 23:53:41] <%Alphaw> @PuppetMaster176 He asked for easiest map to learn, i would still say customs, and if not customs reserve

[2022-12-08 23:56:36] <+PuppetMaster176> @Alphaw i also thought reserve but with how hard the extracts are for new players without RR i didnt want to suggest it

[2022-12-08 23:57:39] <%salgolkin> g36 is cool
[2022-12-08 23:57:46] <InsaneActual> @Alphaw easiest to learn would be factory its super small but its not for a new player lol
[2022-12-08 23:57:52] <%T_RAN> i wouldnt mind seeing a good ole g36 kit
[2022-12-08 23:57:55] <%og_thundercat> i think its too slow for a g36
