[2023-01-04 16:27:39] <@^Nightbot> Before you begin investing, please complete these three steps. 1. Save a minimum of 3-6 months worth of liquid cash as an emergency fund. 2. If your employer offers a matching 401K then contribute up to at least the maximum amount they will match (it's free money). 3. Pay off any high interest debts you may have (credit cards, loans, etc.) and after you have accomplished all three, then we can speak about investing.

[2023-01-04 17:48:30] <+ZeroG34R> @Steve_the_Pirate100 Short answer, no. Longer answer - it's promising for a Canadian trading platform but its still missing important features to be viable.

[2023-01-04 19:41:20] <1GallonCokeZeroADay> 30% less most likely means that rent would be cheaper if you add amortization etc.

[2023-01-04 19:42:32] <MiamiGringo> Ppl don't get this, the average landlord makes around a 2.5-5% cap rate on their rental based on market price... They need to rent for 20-50 years to pay their investment off meanwhile renters are keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars in their pockets. CoC is something like 7%. I can get better returns in literally any investment right now long term than 7% CoC.
