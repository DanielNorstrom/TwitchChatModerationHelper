[2022-12-21 17:30:36] <^StreamElements> And if you're looking for a "win condition" by looking for cards that say "Win the game.", I think that's setting yourself up for disappointment. Rather, there's several ways that Priest can win games; high value control, healing synergies, big minions, Rally stuff, etc.
