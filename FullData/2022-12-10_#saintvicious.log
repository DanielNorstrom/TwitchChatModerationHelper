[2022-12-10 08:22:20] <%+Rhuid> at some point you should probably have a conversation about exclusivity
[2022-12-10 08:22:20] <%+jaws98765> probably
[2022-12-10 08:22:23] <laurberz> yes
[2022-12-10 08:22:29] <%noname313> Probably would get her pissed off
[2022-12-10 08:22:34] <%+jaws98765> after 5 it might start to get assumed
[2022-12-10 08:22:35] <%xOkamiyasha> def piss her off
[2022-12-10 08:22:35] <+Berclex> it totally depends on the person
[2022-12-10 08:22:42] <%xOkamiyasha> one or two dates no worries
[2022-12-10 08:22:42] <+Ruu0101> if they have insecurities and/or expect you to exclusively date them
[2022-12-10 08:22:45] <+Berclex> but if you are wondering about you should bring it up
[2022-12-10 08:22:46] <BrutaIforce> i feel like more than a few and its expected no?
[2022-12-10 08:22:46] <JahBal0603> did you have game with the yasou 60% omnivamp augment yet? had one yesterday 16kdmg yas (jg,titans,qss)

[2022-12-10 08:22:56] <+Ruu0101> most tallk about it if they care
[2022-12-10 08:22:59] <Markhaim> most girls expect exclusivity by default.
[2022-12-10 08:23:12] <paaaauli> Communication is key
[2022-12-10 08:23:14] <+Berclex> debatable
[2022-12-10 08:23:15] <!%junopoy> Wooo I hit plat what rank are you now Saint?
[2022-12-10 08:23:15] <%+evilcise1234> No reasonable well adjusted adult should assume they have a monopoly on you unless discussed.
[2022-12-10 08:23:18] <%xOkamiyasha> not default, but after 3 dates, they do
[2022-12-10 08:23:35] <%+jaws98765> I was going to say after 3-5 it might start to be assumed, but it should still be talked about
