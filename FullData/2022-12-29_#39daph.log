[2022-12-29 17:54:12] <%HackerProdiG> Hi 39daph I have always had a preference for Korean girls like yourself but god damn you are a different breed! I went to Korea a year ago. I loved the culture. Would you like to go on a date with me..? I could pick you up and we could have a bibimbap date and maybe visit a soju bar afterwards! Forgive me if this is too much but you are too yeppuen!
[2022-12-29 17:55:40] <%HellaZach> I mean it depends on how the artist presents it but yeah the beginning of chainsaw man is pretty slow daphShrug
[2022-12-29 17:56:04] <%Jooaaaoo> it has to be some ultra giga art
[2022-12-29 17:56:32] <%Jooaaaoo> like junji ito shit or better
[2022-12-29 17:57:31] <%HackerProdiG> I am so close to unsubscribing from 39Daph. Don't have anything major against Hasanabi but he is way too out of line even when he is joking or whatever. He is so toxic and arrogant that it brought questions for me, one of them is why does she continue playing with him? He is probably even worse in real life. Just way too annoying. And then it occurred to me. Daph is similar to him, unfortunately. Yeah she is cute, smart and amazing in all aspects ,
[2022-12-29 17:58:30] <%tiamani> but perhaps i should stop living a dream of thinking that Daph is this shy, kind and a loving person. She changed over time, for worse. She can be rude to other people as well in many of her videos, being rude to strangers included. The truth sucks so much but ever since her and [redacted] broke up she hasn't been fixed. At least not entirely . I hate to say this but i want the old and kind girl called Daph back. The one that was making hentai content with kind people around her.
[2022-12-29 17:58:44] <%HellaZach> I mean the show does take from the fact that the source material presents shots in a pretty cinematic way. There are good things that you can only get from the animation but the manga has things that the animation doesn't capture either bc it's a different format

[2022-12-29 20:02:15] <%mah_teo> pretty wild to see how many things in DS1 ended up in elden ring though (or like evolved versions)
[2022-12-29 20:02:18] <%Tho0mgarlic> im pretty sure they gonna release some pro version of 5 or 6 soon like in couple of years
[2022-12-29 20:02:23] <%+imsodry> are they really still hard to get?

[2022-12-29 20:03:10] <%jaaawn> I was on bestbuy last night and they set up the site where it'll load to confirm availability before adding to your cart
[2022-12-29 20:03:33] <%+imsodry> even beans got a ps5

[2022-12-29 20:05:00] <%mah_teo> thats a pretty awesome gift
[2022-12-29 20:05:15] <%+imsodry> also sales in japan went up alot too due to stock improvements
[2022-12-29 20:05:41] <%HellaZach> yeah I think it's probably only worth if you don't have a decent pc bc most of the stuff that it had exclusive is getting ported or already ported PepegeHmm
[2022-12-29 20:05:50] <%+imsodry> yeah
[2022-12-29 20:05:51] <%Capownz> Sony got a good 2023 lined up too, spiderman 2 daphCheer
[2022-12-29 20:05:58] <%+imsodry> PS5 just has faster ssd speeds

[2022-12-29 20:06:17] <%+imsodry> i think
[2022-12-29 20:06:24] <%jcraig919> only got my ps5 to play Elden Ring
[2022-12-29 20:06:26] <%Capownz> PS5 can load far faster than most PCs
[2022-12-29 20:06:31] <%+imsodry> ah ok
[2022-12-29 20:06:33] <%Capownz> most games just aren't optimized for it
[2022-12-29 20:06:34] <%+imsodry> thats what i assumed
[2022-12-29 20:06:41] <%+imsodry> thats why some games dont load as fast
[2022-12-29 20:06:42] <%jcraig919> cause no way my pc was gonna handle Elden Ring

[2022-12-29 20:08:47] <%HellaZach> the port*
[2022-12-29 20:09:04] <%Capownz> Im guesing its because they built the game knowing they had a super fast ssd
[2022-12-29 20:09:13] <%Capownz> but now on PC to make up for that they need way more memory to be safe
[2022-12-29 20:09:59] <%+imsodry> i dont man, people hate exclusives and then when they dont they be like KEKW what exclusivs? not point in a console

[2022-12-29 20:11:41] <%Capownz> Cyberpunk plays well on next gen now but you're stuck with like 70fov and controller aim

[2022-12-29 21:44:37] <%Capownz> the basics so far is that there's a bunch of elven clans, they're at war with eachother, this dude fucked the princess and got banshied, she's a bard warrior who sister just died
[2022-12-29 21:45:08] <%Capownz> then some sussy advisors used a monster to kill the heads of each clans when they were brokering a peace and put the emperess as the figure head
[2022-12-29 21:45:19] <%Capownz> now they're cutting eachother for some reason LULW
[2022-12-29 21:46:28] <%+imsodry> oh this is the elven dimension
