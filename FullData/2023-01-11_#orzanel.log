[2023-01-11 08:35:45] <Zeplexx> they nerfed this line into ground because of the cry about bz-176
[2023-01-11 08:35:45] <%+lepre_tw> I assume tier 7-8 will be fucked for good now
[2023-01-11 08:35:52] <masteryoda_thedarkone> well people cry about how op it was on the supertest and they removed the he gun and made the turret trash

[2023-01-11 12:11:27] <therealslimfatty> You can get penned pretty easily in the turret with gold right?
[2023-01-11 12:11:41] <therealslimfatty> Its kinda flat
[2023-01-11 12:11:48] <el_ninno420> and i cant do the 5 crit mission 2 days

[2023-01-11 12:12:02] <MakMak02> no point in grinding this line for me
[2023-01-11 12:12:03] <SirEdno> so why do you take Rations instead of the estiguisher
[2023-01-11 12:12:04] <+kriskaem> BZ 176 is also flammable

[2023-01-11 12:12:24] <Condonation> !bz75
[2023-01-11 12:12:24] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, not the best armor, ok-ish gun handling for that alpha, it's kinda slow but you got the rockets to make up for it.Overall ok-ish tank.
[2023-01-11 12:12:36] <%+demZyxx> is it? never encountered fire in the 176
[2023-01-11 12:12:38] <@%Mustang__6521> for cheeks you need high pen
[2023-01-11 12:13:05] <Condonation> !bz68
[2023-01-11 12:13:05] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, gets set on fire alot, gun handling not the greatest, takes some time to aim, good hulldown with small weakspots, overall ok-ish tank.

[2023-01-11 12:14:27] <@%Mustang__6521> its 330mm turret cheek..only TDs firing gold can pen it
[2023-01-11 12:14:35] <@%Mustang__6521> but not reliably though
[2023-01-11 12:14:40] <therealslimfatty> Ok thanks

[2023-01-11 12:24:08] <@^Nightbot> Orzy recommends for average/not so good players Defender, IS3-A, Object 703 if for sale, if not Löwe also works. From the bond shop Liberte and Guard. For more experienced players/good players the previous tanks also apply + Su-130, Skopion G, Progetto, ShPtk,Object 274a for grinding credits. Other OP premiums that suck at moneymaking can be Chrysler, Skoda T56, Bourrasque. For Light Tanks, M41 GF and LT432.

[2023-01-11 13:07:06] <spartans_kill> !bz
[2023-01-11 13:07:06] <@^Nightbot> Very fun derp tank, gun is reliable, armor is good, decent speed, pen is okay for top tier games, might feel low in higher ones. Overall a fun tank!
[2023-01-11 13:07:16] <Kobastal> !bz75
[2023-01-11 13:07:16] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, not the best armor, ok-ish gun handling for that alpha, it's kinda slow but you got the rockets to make up for it.Overall ok-ish tank.
[2023-01-11 13:07:36] <!%basin79> How picture this. It's a sunny day. The golf cruising the streets at 15mph. Window down and this blaring out. Orzy bobbing his head with a shit eating grin. Desi with her head down praying no one sees her.

[2023-01-11 13:17:06] <!%basin79> With 240mm pen on the derp they're not even bad for the game with the HE mechanics. You need to aim for weak spots or do little damage.

[2023-01-11 13:41:14] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, not the best armor, ok-ish gun handling for that alpha, it's kinda slow but you got the rockets to make up for it.Overall ok-ish tank.
[2023-01-11 13:41:28] <+Mathematicus_GR> Hi master Orzy
[2023-01-11 13:41:30] <ziga2017> i did
[2023-01-11 13:41:37] <rejuuzr> do you recomend grinding the american light tanks
[2023-01-11 13:41:46] <rejuuzr> im new to the game
[2023-01-11 13:41:59] <@%Mustang__6521> !new @rejuuzr
[2023-01-11 13:41:59] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics
[2023-01-11 13:42:09] <Bishox> maybe the situation wasnt that bad or they messed up and didnt give the ban
[2023-01-11 13:42:20] <@%ShoppingDisaster> leo was playing just like d3p PixelBob
[2023-01-11 13:42:23] <@%Mustang__6521> American LTs are not that good when you have are new
[2023-01-11 13:42:23] <+peter6345> @ziga2017 i use to play at least 100 battles a day everyday for a long time until i got tired of WoT and took a few months off from it.

[2023-01-11 13:43:12] <SzemiG> Hi Orzanel! Q: reduce the gun dispersion or reduce the aiming circle? which is better?

[2023-01-11 13:43:31] <ziga2017> @Bishox  dud push me into ennemy fire from bush where i was,blocking me to go back,for no reason and i died ofc
[2023-01-11 13:43:33] <+uselesseater42> get T100-LT or get your hands on Char mle 75 if u can. If you want good light tank
[2023-01-11 13:43:50] <@%ShoppingDisaster> no work or chores then oke
[2023-01-11 13:43:55] <@%Mustang__6521> learn the game first before getting LTs
[2023-01-11 13:44:02] <Bishox> aiming circle is better in 90% of situations

[2023-01-11 13:45:17] <+uselesseater42> easier to hit
[2023-01-11 13:45:37] <ziga2017> @uselesseater42 Char mle 75  is good light? LUL
[2023-01-11 13:45:49] <+uselesseater42> i love char mle
[2023-01-11 13:45:59] <@%Mustang__6521> char is soo good
[2023-01-11 13:46:06] <!%basin79> Even if you're great in light tanks they're almost entirely pointless now. Not many maps are light tank friendly and those that are your team mates usually don't bother shooting what you spot.
[2023-01-11 13:46:07] <@%Mustang__6521> I love to ram everything in it
[2023-01-11 13:46:09] <@%ShoppingDisaster> are the boosters big help on this tank? PixelBob
[2023-01-11 13:46:25] <+uselesseater42> yea and good rammer as well for a light tank :)
[2023-01-11 13:46:35] <+uselesseater42> also 1K damage clip when u can land all shots :)
[2023-01-11 13:46:42] <@%Mustang__6521> only downside is you have to fire a lot of gold

[2023-01-11 13:59:49] <+uselesseater42> but if it's too powerfull, like it is right now
