[2023-01-10 17:49:21] <Hammer_96_> @Tines_Deepwater There is not

[2023-01-10 17:50:13] <%+aamaxlew> Got it, thanks. I will need to learn the mods before I start playing again
[2023-01-10 17:50:58] <+TheGreenMan321> @aamaxlew I run like 144 different mods on a server I’m on. There’s so many good ones.
[2023-01-10 17:51:04] <Tines_Deepwater> Hammer_96_ i thought there is. but, then again, i never survived a bite so....

[2023-01-10 17:51:44] <%+aamaxlew> @thegreenman321 Any advice on how to choose when you’re starting out?
[2023-01-10 17:52:17] <Hammer_96_> You can disable getting infected via blood but salvia/bite always infects you. In vanilla there is no way to survive the zombie infection. (wounds getting infected is seperate)
[2023-01-10 17:52:59] <+c9bigballs> Man, I never played MP in this. Looks so much more fun
[2023-01-10 17:53:04] <+TheGreenMan321> @aamaxlew when you go onto the steam workshop they have the most popular downloads tab. Start cycling through and get what sounds cool. Best ones in my opinion are the skill recovery journal, brittas guns and armor packs and then the added vehicle mods.

[2023-01-10 17:54:51] <Hammer_96_> Hydrocraft adds a lot but is honestly far to messy and convoluted for my tastes
[2023-01-10 17:55:20] VIEWERS: 556
[2023-01-10 17:56:29] <Tines_Deepwater> skill recovery journal is too lenient for me. makes the game too soft.
[2023-01-10 17:56:39] <Hammer_96_> Thats fair
[2023-01-10 17:56:42] <+TheGreenMan321> @aamaxlew there is also a mod called “don’t feed the zombies” and it gives zombies the ability to turn into hoards and they are attracted to dead zombies. Makes the game even harder but more fun. There’s a “night runner” zombie mod too. But that’s if you want to poop yourself every time the sun goes down. Zombies turn into sprinters at night
[2023-01-10 17:57:08] <Avithan69> DAng i forget how to hotwire

[2023-01-10 19:58:06] <Lord_Nightmare> technically to be realistic you could use that spotlight generator trailer to power the gas pumps, to pump the underground tank, but i don't know if the game supports that yet
[2023-01-10 19:58:11] <Hammer_96_> I don't think it will ever full release
[2023-01-10 19:58:16] <%+Jencey86> at least it's one of those "complete" EA games

[2023-01-10 20:36:38] <$CapnSlipp> Hoards of burning zombies.
[2023-01-10 20:36:42] <@%$Everleigh> If cars can go through the fires with no issues....then not a big deal.
[2023-01-10 20:37:23] <$CapnSlipp> Not by other players.  Over in Riverside or something.
[2023-01-10 20:37:30] <%arjantablet> Run and Talk
[2023-01-10 20:37:42] <%itssalsashark> @Cringer Wouldn't Milos' character be unable to talk ingame? Or at least hear?

[2023-01-10 21:01:07] <%+prickleypete101> right click the gun and go to Upgrade then Silencer... Both gun and silencer need to be in your inventory. Also silencer needs to be for that type of gun (ie Rifle, Shotgun, pistol)
