[2022-12-27 16:27:51] <n00rman_> copy paste gadget would do an entire floor in one click
[2022-12-27 16:27:55] <%+Corvous> is dires copy and pase tool in this pack? that could be even faster
[2022-12-27 16:28:19] <officialhunterx> theres a maxium
[2022-12-27 16:28:21] <Linkitch> You don't have enough inventory space to do it in one click.

[2022-12-27 16:28:46] <+jberk26> Can’t you just put a cobblestone gen on an obsidian furnace?
[2022-12-27 16:29:15] <Linkitch> Color coding the blocks around the elevators would make it easier to figure out what floor you are on.
[2022-12-27 16:29:17] <n00rman_> imagine if you could link the copy paste gadget to ae storage
[2022-12-27 16:29:19] <natsu130> yes

[2022-12-27 16:29:33] <%Venxuri> imo do it in the multismelter and make patterns for on demand crafting

[2022-12-27 17:38:44] <@%+Nexhunter> if you get a smart thermostat from your energy providers then yes it will be wired in

[2022-12-27 17:38:53] <kane1941> that was a quick load time
[2022-12-27 17:38:54] <Unwanted_Endlessness> You dont have to sign up for it and block the setting
[2022-12-27 17:38:54] <obylix> you can opt in for that for a lower bill

[2022-12-27 17:39:00] <obylix> but by default no
[2022-12-27 17:39:02] <%TheWonderLlama> You can sign up for a savings on some grids if you let them control your thermostat
[2022-12-27 17:39:05] <kypudo> did you add the parameters?
[2022-12-27 17:39:09] <RingSong> seeing diagonal geometry in minecraft is bizarre
[2022-12-27 17:39:09] <+MadWolf1290> it *can* but that depends on your energy provider letting Nest know about it

[2022-12-27 17:39:14] <%Zenimer> That was never the point. People found out that power companies were doing it

[2022-12-27 17:39:16] <%maccabeus> how could that go wrong
[2022-12-27 17:39:20] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle you can get a smart thermostat from your provider and you will be opted in automatically
[2022-12-27 17:39:28] <@%+Nexhunter> otherwise it always opt in
[2022-12-27 17:39:33] <%Pbjtime54> until ur house is 90* and they lock ur a/c out
[2022-12-27 17:39:37] <+xNew> That happened in Colorado

[2022-12-27 19:48:43] <%+P00nDozer69> nah flip sides are the best, half pretzel half cracker. great for charcuterie as well
[2022-12-27 19:48:48] <kane1941> do you remember all the things you automated yet at different tiers?
[2022-12-27 19:48:51] <@%ninopanda> @fishypooos i know i was being funny, since the KEKW.  but honestly they have not announced any changes.  just more of the same stuff.  you can still do a lot of stuff on F2P and if you grind enough you can get omega.
[2022-12-27 19:48:52] <The_Flembo> I can understand club crackers, but no way saltines are better than ritz
[2022-12-27 19:49:01] <+gdawg99> eating too many ritz gets greasy over time compared to saltines imo

[2022-12-27 19:49:30] <+Furiak> club crackers are legit
[2022-12-27 19:49:31] <%Dagmoo> yeah saltines are a perfect snack NODDERS
[2022-12-27 19:49:32] <%+SirNickGaming> Ritz chips go really hard. They are extra crispy but taste like Ritz

[2022-12-27 19:51:20] <Fluffymagicman> it's the better one
[2022-12-27 19:51:20] <%+Ouroboros_LoL> you could just set it to always have 1 made at any one time so it doesn't eat though your plates and you  don't have to craft them

[2022-12-27 20:10:04] <%maimvice13> don't output in the same interface
[2022-12-27 20:10:04] <%+Angel0death> yeah, we have contractors that train people on yalls jets @az1iiiz
[2022-12-27 20:10:17] <Starmetal_> item conduit sucks the bolt into the input slot from interface, can happen sometimes
[2022-12-27 20:10:26] <+JaFoste99> is this the GTCEu port?
[2022-12-27 20:10:30] <%McFlannel> DOD and military in general is sort of moving in a direction that is very unfavorable. Most hospitals/offices are moving towards the DHA model and it is failing. At least in the dmv area
[2022-12-27 20:10:32] <%TheResinger> @JaFoste99 yes
[2022-12-27 20:10:43] <drsnaki96> when it's imported in the interface there is a small amount of time that the item is available to be extracted back to the machine
[2022-12-27 20:10:54] <dylan0806> Import filters?
[2022-12-27 20:10:56] <+Babyblasphemy> The -> in the gregtech machines is auto export mode I think
[2022-12-27 20:10:58] <+loaded57> @Giantwaffle cant you use an ender chest import system to avoid it?
[2022-12-27 20:10:59] <%lazyhot> or blacklist the output item in your input channel

[2022-12-27 20:11:10] VIEWERS: 3 103
[2022-12-27 20:11:11] <+Schutter07> you can use a dedicated interface for importing in the system
[2022-12-27 20:11:14] <kitty_cat20> you can put an import on an ender chest, an use conduit to put the items on the ender chest
[2022-12-27 20:11:31] <Polkich> Can;t you like change the auto output side with a screwdriver?
[2022-12-27 20:11:31] <Az1iiiz> @Angel0death my dad worked as contractor trainer after he retired. they usually do that cause of experience
[2022-12-27 20:11:34] <+Abudun2011> make a blacklist for bolts in the conduit
[2022-12-27 20:11:41] <+Babyblasphemy> I think you can move the export direction with wrench, though that might be knowledge from 1.6.4 that hasn't ported this far lol

[2022-12-27 20:49:12] <MonteKuchen> for everything, newer tiers get more expensive and doing stuff at hv is fine

[2022-12-27 20:54:01] <The_Holas> isnt less air ... with like less machines?

[2022-12-27 20:54:38] <R1Rider01> air is free, but requires power.   apatite you'll be getting on the first drone anyways.
[2022-12-27 20:54:38] <MonteKuchen> PureSpider SeemsGood
[2022-12-27 20:54:40] <+itamarb77> the only core component of the recipe that isnt free is appetite. you should use less of it
[2022-12-27 20:54:43] <%Dagmoo> pati may have automated it?
[2022-12-27 20:54:55] <%Dagmoo> or was that only PTE and PVC

[2022-12-27 21:39:00] <%DX_Plates> Twitch is eventually just going to be all emote spam, those emote bots are replicating.
[2022-12-27 21:39:04] [Notification] SourUranium subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months!
[2022-12-27 21:39:13] <SolariusUOX> So nomifactory is the pinnacle of all those other versions?

[2022-12-27 21:39:54] <Glacial_Indifference> Blue Yeti has power QC issues, so their gain control and noise gating is inconsistent.

[2022-12-27 21:58:34] <LethalBro> I mean Pati is doing a bunch of liqquid storage already
[2022-12-27 21:58:38] <officialhunterx> I know 128 fully upgraded numi generator will get you to end game
[2022-12-27 21:58:39] <Thalmize> might as well since its soo cheap in AE
[2022-12-27 21:58:42] <FairePlaie> stay focus :)
[2022-12-27 21:58:44] <kane1941> Pati just did you a massive tanker
[2022-12-27 21:58:44] <%magyx__> do it

[2022-12-27 21:59:18] <%+Angel0death> Pati already has deep storage... no point not too use it lmao

[2022-12-27 21:59:33] <%magyx__> they are instant
[2022-12-27 21:59:41] <officialhunterx> don't forget they can be upgraded with speed extract
[2022-12-27 21:59:47] <%lazyhot> with a redstone card in importer to EA you can also work with the emitter auto stop on lvl ?
[2022-12-27 21:59:52] <%$frainsbreeze> you just need to extract air. waste of conduit
