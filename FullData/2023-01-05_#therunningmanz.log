[2023-01-05 15:55:21] <thecardiazxd> I dont play official because its so awfully laggy

[2023-01-05 15:55:25] <%uncle__rucku5> atleast dayz doesn't have a problem with the devs cheating themselves like ark is dealing with right now
[2023-01-05 15:55:30] <+swiftmod92> I play ps5 official servers for the vanilla essence and it's just kos all the time. no interactions or talking just shooting on sight.

[2023-01-05 15:55:39] <%BluSeventyThree> @the_dailynomad they have active admins in game and official can't do that
[2023-01-05 15:55:44] <%+galasteve> @the_dailynomad community admins can ban hackers.  On official, no one is finding and banning hackers.  It‚Äôs only the battleye software that ‚Äúprevents‚Äù it
[2023-01-05 15:55:52] <+AdamWas_Here> i wonder if they're stuck in a contract with battle eye they cant get out of for a while
[2023-01-05 15:55:52] <jabok_tv> I have 7000 hours on DayZ and I‚Äôve only died to cheaters on official for the last 700+ hours
[2023-01-05 15:55:52] <sham101> not our problem, we paid for the game
[2023-01-05 15:55:58] <CodfatherOfSoul> Deal with the cheating instead of adding rocket launchers and Humvees that nobody asked for.
[2023-01-05 15:56:00] <thecardiazxd> @swiftmod92 yeah console dayZ is pretty much always like that on every server
[2023-01-05 15:56:02] <%MyWayLoL> just a raid 0 anticheat like valorant did and all cheaters gone, easy
[2023-01-05 15:56:05] <%PistNbroke01> the game on xbox is not near as good as on pc.  however at least this isnt a issue i feel i have to face when i play it
[2023-01-05 15:56:08] <@%^Nightbot> TRMZ releases a new video every week on YT, you can go and see highlights of his adventures here: youtube.com/therunningmanz

[2023-01-05 15:56:15] <%TheLoneStrider> No point devolving the game anymore if it doesn‚Äôt work.. need to fix it
[2023-01-05 15:56:20] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> @wasted_soldier U got old or new Xbox?‚Ä¶ new runs Nice..played og Xbox for years new x much better
[2023-01-05 15:56:22] <+prefab_trout> presumably a hacker has a character in game on server. Surely an auto ban dished out to kills above 2km would fix some of it as a start?
[2023-01-05 15:56:33] <krisggm> @swiftmod92 not always kos. I play quite often official too. Depends on wich one you choose. But i met quite some interesting people over there
[2023-01-05 15:56:33] <%+cmantoss> @therunningmanz as shit as console is compared to PC, I'm glad I started on there because it doesn't really have the hacker problems so I could learn on official properly
[2023-01-05 15:56:36] <+cryptonious> how would you suggest to better land new players ? I completely agree with you I've had friends say fuck it and stop playing due to exactly what you are saying
[2023-01-05 15:56:37] <thecardiazxd> if official wasn‚Äôt so laggy on console I would play it
[2023-01-05 15:56:37] <+lBanbringerl> basically no game with anticheat on steam prevents cheats in short period. they ban cheaters on a longer basis so they can keep selling the game to the same person
[2023-01-05 15:56:38] <%+golden4ge> 1 of those servers you mentioned are riddled with cheaters
[2023-01-05 15:56:39] <%FriedrichHecker> Its maybe similar with Rainbow Six. Over christmas all the top streamers basically only played cheaters. Very critical for new viewers. Also Battle Eye anti cheat btw NotLikeThis

[2023-01-05 15:58:07] <%WorldOfCracraft> cheating has ruined many good games
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <%Secrytt> theres cheating in every form of game tho, even life, theres no stopping it its just the nature of the beast
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <%dmpca> cheaters will never end though, thats the reality of PC online gaming, and thats every game, you look at any popular to unpopular game, cheating is rampant, more every year, and it fucking sucks, but its every games main problem, its easier to cheat then it is to devolp a anti cheat to stop it faster
[2023-01-05 15:58:13] <%+monstercjt> Like warzone cheats

[2023-01-05 15:58:40] <CodfatherOfSoul> @cun8 There are hackers and being someone who started on Console and then switched to PC...PC is 1000% better than console
[2023-01-05 15:58:41] <%WorldOfCracraft> i feel like going to games developers offices and saying that is a great game you have there...but do you have a good anticheat in place
[2023-01-05 15:58:46] <jabok_tv> I promise you that 95% of your deaths on official are cheaters if you randomly just die whilst full sprinting
[2023-01-05 15:58:46] <%PistNbroke01> it would be a good video with all your heavily geared characters falling to the cheats would make a good  video, and obviously not to pump your tires @TheRunningManZ  it would get alot of eyes on it because of your platform

[2023-01-05 15:59:13] <notsoslimshady36> I bought the game before xmas and 1st thing i learnt was that you just can't play on offical servers only community servers are worth the time investing in

[2023-01-05 16:12:26] <+wasted_soldier> i think microsoft should end hwspoof.... and people who use cheats should be legally liable especially the vendors

[2023-01-05 16:12:35] <+kalkohlive> Hackers use the in game processes and in game code to inject their own undetectable code to manipulate the dayZ game into doing what they want basically, aim bot is just manipulating the bullet velocity and making ur viewport lock on to enemy hitboxes
[2023-01-05 16:12:36] <+t0da90> is this vanilla server?
[2023-01-05 16:12:38] <atmdigital> i disagree with what u said about a game having to run on its own servers
[2023-01-05 16:12:38] <%jack_burtonn> Ive seen dudes make 800m shots with a glock. Thats hacking lol
[2023-01-05 16:12:40] <bertvde1963> Cheat as much as you want in a solo game. But cheating in a multiplayer game should really be banned. Even developing means to cheat should already be a criminal offence. You ruin the fun of others who spent money on it.
[2023-01-05 16:12:40] <%TomEmilioDavies> Did you spawn already sarving?
[2023-01-05 16:12:43] <%wils0ff> how would you feel about the Devs implementing skins you can buy?

[2023-01-05 16:12:50] <+Jsamsyadig> @thecardiazxd Exactly, no big streamer is gonna risk getting caught abusing that power
[2023-01-05 16:13:02] <jackhammer0115> it's time everyone should fight back on the official servers

[2023-01-05 16:14:18] <atmdigital> dayz being mostly private servers reminds me of how trackmania doesnt make any maps for the players, all community made.   developers basically just offer the platform.     i think its a cool format that lets the community shape the gane

[2023-01-05 16:38:08] <%+gringo_smoker> easier to get caught on 1pp at least on 3pp some scenarios look like 3 person peaking
[2023-01-05 16:38:11] <%+movemaker_> @jigglenaut that doesn't sound enjoyable in the slightest
[2023-01-05 16:38:13] <%papadeath44> 3rd person is basically cheating anyway

[2023-01-05 19:01:17] <TGreat> I paid retail, but waited for there to be a good sale. there are websites that track steam prices and tell you when it is low

[2023-01-05 19:01:37] <+moody_swan> Yeah i like to pay normal prices for games, videos and most of all music. But i understand if someone is less fortunate and does not have the money to play full prices
[2023-01-05 19:01:38] <+spandy> couldn't they just nullify the keys that were bought fraudulently?
[2023-01-05 19:01:41] <kauvertrag> Officially NOT on sale anymore

[2023-01-05 19:01:59] <@%Unclefood> Wasn't there a credit card thing at one point, G2A stealing cards to buy games, selling them cheap, and then the keys deactivating after it was reported by the card owner?

[2023-01-05 20:23:21] <%$BPMETALMILITIA> Worth the wait
[2023-01-05 20:23:22] <%mxcannondale> Maybe he combat logged
[2023-01-05 20:23:23] <%+Bulldog_ufk> definitely not dead in the barn?
[2023-01-05 20:23:23] <%+Bravoalltheway> did u check the barn?
[2023-01-05 20:23:28] <%+Padlabeur> Are you sure they were together ??
[2023-01-05 20:23:31] <mr_taff_92> you think you un cond him and broken his leg

[2023-01-05 20:24:16] <%+InZanebc> I think blue backpack guy stumbled upon them just before you did. the meat you found before at the tents was the one piece left over that wouldn't fit and the guy you killed pack and that's it

[2023-01-05 22:16:01] <%Skippski> Broken arm discription from the discord "A broken arm will cause you to have increased sway and recoil, and when not having a splint applied, can even cause you to pass out when raising a weapon for too long. You'll even find morphine and painkillers to be helpful to mitigate the effects of your broken arm."
[2023-01-05 22:16:01] <%Sobok_de_la_baguette> it's just ads for tarkov, they don't care if viewers leave, they probably sold some copy from this ops
