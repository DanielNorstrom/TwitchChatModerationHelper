[2023-01-01 14:54:46] <%+Skar_> now*
[2023-01-01 14:55:02] <%doximanman> if im decent but not perfect at rein do you think its better to learn another hero or to one trick rein and try to improve even when im playing like shit? @LhCloudy27
[2023-01-01 14:55:07] <+sabre5395> genji low key carrying this game
[2023-01-01 14:55:21] <VeeXYZ> @sabre5395 probably. I think what they should have done was NOT add that change. But if they really had too.. maybe have shields decrease the damage by 50%
[2023-01-01 14:55:50] VIEWERS: 234
[2023-01-01 14:56:04] <%doximanman> i mean... hog can work even without being super experienced at playing him, no? LUL
[2023-01-01 14:56:05] <@%sansaburo> AAAA
[2023-01-01 14:56:20] <Naoxys> AAAA
[2023-01-01 14:57:19] <+sabre5395> @VeeXYZ Yeah I think it was unnecessary
[2023-01-01 14:57:38] <+sabre5395> The falloff change was more than enough IMO
[2023-01-01 14:57:40] <%doximanman> i meant play another hero when it goes bad as rein, not to switch completely
[2023-01-01 14:57:52] VIEWERS: 234
[2023-01-01 14:58:13] <%doximanman> not to main another hero i mean

[2023-01-01 14:59:44] <%doximanman> sometimes they have an insane hog that just picks at my dps and it seems like playing rein is throwing LUL

[2023-01-01 15:07:24] <ChocolateGIRLxx> not to kill but to get out of the hook
[2023-01-01 15:07:43] <%doximanman> if the enemy hog is popping off isnt it better to go dva or orisa? @LhCloudy27
[2023-01-01 15:07:49] <Naoxys> ana is quite a threat against hog

[2023-01-01 17:39:26] <CHICKEN2XD> All sigma is fun for is lifting opponents from point
[2023-01-01 17:39:26] <$marodas2> Winton and Ram?
[2023-01-01 17:39:27] <TheeABCs> rein can spam the chat

[2023-01-01 17:39:50] <%evilstunky> you're talking about matchup into rein but most people dont play rein
[2023-01-01 17:39:52] <luazri> sigma doesn't have footsteps

[2023-01-01 17:40:50] <@%$PayMeToThrow> if orisa does her rotation correct she never doesnt have an ability up

[2023-01-01 17:40:51] <maxsonfinn> orisa is f tier cause shes fucking boring to play and its a video game i play for fun
[2023-01-01 17:40:53] <%+TheTurtleHax> sig is okay into other matchups
[2023-01-01 17:40:53] <maxsonfinn> thats why

[2023-01-01 17:41:35] <maxsonfinn> ball fucks if you cant counter him
[2023-01-01 17:41:36] <+kelebraska> winston is just too easy to kill even with a support
[2023-01-01 17:41:36] <%anung> I rather take the rock or Doom punch before teammates
[2023-01-01 17:41:38] <avon_blocksdale> ball is ok????

[2023-01-01 17:41:48] <maxsonfinn> but if u rush their backline ball cant protect his squishies

[2023-01-01 17:41:54] <+Guts72> Only roadhog beats winston atm

[2023-01-01 17:42:14] <avon_blocksdale> I mean I saw junkerqueen is top 5 LUL
[2023-01-01 17:42:18] <%evilstunky> ball is good because of nerfs to others
[2023-01-01 17:42:20] <maxsonfinn> ball will never be shit just by his design
[2023-01-01 17:42:23] <%evilstunky> And orisa cant always focus him
[2023-01-01 17:42:24] <maxsonfinn> he is a carry hero
[2023-01-01 17:42:25] <%YoungsterGlenn> Isn't Korea a bunch of Balls
[2023-01-01 17:42:25] <+TheTurtleHax> oh yeah
[2023-01-01 17:42:28] <%anung> but you have to be really good at ball
[2023-01-01 17:42:29] <Wh00pSid3iZi> ball needs buffs
[2023-01-01 17:42:30] <avon_blocksdale> man
[2023-01-01 17:42:40] <%+TheTurtleHax> ball is genuinly good  i think
[2023-01-01 17:42:41] <maxsonfinn> just like how necros could carry on genji all those years the hero was shit
[2023-01-01 17:42:46] <maxsonfinn> good balls will always be good
[2023-01-01 17:42:47] <$Topsy__Cret> @anung obviously, to be rank 1.....

[2023-01-01 17:42:59] <%geno69> if ball gets buffs, supports will just stop playing in most ranks xd
[2023-01-01 17:43:04] <+Synex_ow> master challenger, what happened to shame....
[2023-01-01 17:43:05] <bthagreatfc> Oh no season6 on the team
[2023-01-01 17:43:05] <@%$PayMeToThrow> if rein had speed boost ability this game would be completely balanced
[2023-01-01 17:43:07] <papajis> Ball is good, just hard for people to get good with and their team to play around

[2023-01-01 17:43:35] <kaymaroarts> gigachad
[2023-01-01 17:43:38] <maxsonfinn> ball is actually easy to play and play with because he does his own thing independent of the rest of the team
[2023-01-01 17:43:45] <+AlexIsBeastmode> Only ball change would be reducing cool down on hook when you spawn.
[2023-01-01 17:43:46] <maxsonfinn> winston is a better ball but requires team workl
[2023-01-01 17:44:02] <sdsgruu> he's just better
[2023-01-01 17:44:07] <Wh00pSid3iZi> he switches ball only when it's good? but he mains other tanks?

[2023-01-01 17:44:18] <luazri> ball is good for solo queue experience if you're good with him
[2023-01-01 17:44:20] <hairyarmpitsenjoyer> winston hard af to play
[2023-01-01 17:44:20] <maxsonfinn> see i think winston is a lot harder to play

[2023-01-01 17:50:43] <maxsonfinn> at least by design she should be but shes overtuned and can w into rein and win
[2023-01-01 17:50:44] <tricky_tracky> man I find it very funny when enemy tank switch from  mirroring to counter
[2023-01-01 17:50:44] <%+Aceattack> they need to take away orisa gun and hand her the javelin so she is also melee tank
[2023-01-01 17:50:46] <maxsonfinn> its dumb

[2023-01-01 17:51:49] <%+Aceattack> they will rework hog and forget about orisa
[2023-01-01 17:51:52] <+Guts72> I highly doubt Orisa will get nerfed
[2023-01-01 17:51:57] <tricky_tracky> I never do that I enjoy the mirror even if I lose
[2023-01-01 17:51:59] <%GIRLinMaleBody> complain in their discord
[2023-01-01 17:52:04] <ayaponzu_> orisa damage dropoff range is better than... cassidy, lmao
[2023-01-01 17:52:18] <+Guts72> The Orisa buffs were so no needed
[2023-01-01 17:52:23] <%GIRLinMaleBody> no other projectile has a dropoff
[2023-01-01 17:52:37] <%+Aceattack> recent buffs aren‚Äôt the issue. orisa was always this annoying vs rein in ow2

[2023-01-01 17:53:31] <Kottaryy> what would you nerf on her
[2023-01-01 17:53:32] <runnymorringggg> super using orisa and everyone using orisa now. better than hog I guess
[2023-01-01 17:53:34] <maxsonfinn> zarya good against mei and orisa js
[2023-01-01 17:53:35] <tricky_tracky> yeah but now rein can't even use shield against her ult

[2023-01-01 17:53:45] <thehokeypogi> she wasn't even bad last season either. the buffs didn't make much sense
[2023-01-01 17:53:47] <fuki63> they should make orisa like ow1
[2023-01-01 17:53:51] <%anung> what a sad world we live in when Orisa is a good tank
[2023-01-01 17:53:53] <%mkultra25> headshot in fortify?
[2023-01-01 17:54:15] <@%$PayMeToThrow> increase her cooldowns is so needed

[2023-01-01 17:54:21] <generalvonroom> Pog
[2023-01-01 17:54:24] <SSWaterWorld> uhhh outplayed the orisa
[2023-01-01 17:54:25] <+Guts72> @Aceattack Plenty of people played, Going winston & ignoring Orisa won every game, No one does it now cause they just switch hog and kill winston

[2023-01-01 17:54:50] <%anung> I think her cooldowns need to be longer
[2023-01-01 17:54:54] <%+Aceattack> @guts72 yeah that‚Äôs true. the no ult penalty on swap is making this worse

[2023-01-01 17:54:58] <@%$PayMeToThrow> an orisa rotating her abilities never needs to stop shooting the fan and spear cools her gun enough

[2023-01-01 21:12:30] <@%aidreu> white_tygga but its impossible to consistently have worse teammates than enemy, most times ur teammates are shit but so is enemy
[2023-01-01 21:12:46] <@%aidreu> only thing u can do is make as little mistakes as possible
[2023-01-01 21:12:54] <%geno69> @GIRLinMaleBody you have to think that enemy team has the same kind of players as well. There are unwinnable games, but tons of winnable ones as well.just keep playing :)
[2023-01-01 21:12:55] <xgogglesx> i only play qp i just started playing the game feel im grasping it well.. but everytime i play ranked i got someone acting like they are ML7 trying to dictate everything

[2023-01-01 22:48:51] <Frondoll_> maybe they are cheaper
[2023-01-01 22:48:52] <bananstol> koreans work hard but do they work smart? doubt it

[2023-01-01 22:49:37] <thehyp0cr1te> but these days na and eu teams can easily beat koreans
[2023-01-01 22:49:39] <lordesenhor> no one IS better than hanbin, proper, the Dallas healers and any korean coach
[2023-01-01 22:49:50] <boumsy_boy> owl also killed any tournaments involving money
