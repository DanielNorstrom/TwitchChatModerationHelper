[2023-01-09 15:35:47] <+alteregon> I mean Sim is doing a perfect rotation without any ms delay on cd pressing etc on standing completetly still its near impossible to be near the same. Also look if you managed to change the quality of enchants etc, you might have a lvl 2 quality but the sim does it with lvl3 might make a huge difference in the end

[2023-01-09 17:09:24] <+jakfirff> @phnxx87 It'd be a waste of time playing an off meta class in the MDI, theres no reason for him to do it
[2023-01-09 17:09:26] <smuf187> @phnxx87 i think on this lvl playing (world first, mdi) there is no point for fun classes, you have to play what is needed
[2023-01-09 17:09:26] <+PMrD97> @phnxx87 when you go for world first mythic, and winning the MDI every season theres kind of just no reason not to put your effort into fotm

[2023-01-09 17:10:26] <+PMrD97> id assume he enjoys the competition aspect of it much more than which class he is playing specifically, and hes been doing it for years so i think its safe to say hes happy doing what hes doing

[2023-01-09 18:47:42] <veiloflonelystars> @cythox_ i have seen so many underpeforming dpsers geting tier in pugs it's hilarious

[2023-01-09 18:48:03] <+tempsi17> @unholyhoit i mean the game is like a month and a half old lol .. its not like valor is your only source of upgrades..
[2023-01-09 18:48:17] <cythox_> I mean i dont mind if people with low dps get it through pugging because maybe theyre just not good but still want some loot they need

[2023-01-09 18:54:32] <%lbalalld> @unholyhoit its a way to increase play time. if everybody was almost close to max gear now then a lot of people would quit when theres probably around 3 months or 4 months left of the patch.

[2023-01-09 18:57:25] <%lbalalld> @ichbinsnickk cannot find group in m+ and raids? thats a player issue more than a gear issue imo, you can easily get into m+ with higher rating, and raids never been a problem for me even tho ive been unlucky with loot and currently at 397 ilvl with hc and normal cleared every week and just got my 2pc tier set this week.
[2023-01-09 18:57:28] <musfar2> @ichbinsnickk now i just make the grp and kick ppl doing that, much more fun :)

[2023-01-09 18:58:17] <%lbalalld> @unholyhoit i feel like people play more pvp for the sake of playing pvp, the gear is just something you need. how many would still play pvp if there was no gearing system there? probably 90% of the people that already do

[2023-01-09 21:15:16] <+Itshiko> Playing Protection Warrior is the hardest thing in World of Warcraft Dragonflight. It requires a lot of attention to detail and focus. Do I press my Ignore Pain button hard enough or do I need to press it harder? It requires a second monitor to be able to watch a Netflix show in a background while you roll the face on a keyboard while playing the game. Only true and real players can handle the depth of the gameplay of such tank, some people will never understand. Pathetic you all are.
