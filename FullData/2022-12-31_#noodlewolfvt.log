[2022-12-31 01:34:49] <%+SilvyrSphere> well in the old day people referred the earth as mother earth so in alot of older societies a place of one's birth was always female because they were given birth within that area
[2022-12-31 01:34:54] <%Shizounu> Its not as gendered as some other european ones. German for exampel has 3 and every word has one of them

[2022-12-31 01:36:49] <%Shizounu> The gender of a nation is probably mostly based the cultural influences of a specific nation

[2022-12-31 01:40:26] <Naliina> I was always under the impression the origin was affectionate but I've heard some claim its misogynistic in origin. Something about "She's a whiny one, she is." being a phrase I heard quite often as well.

[2022-12-31 01:40:46] <Naliina> Oft either lovingly referred to but sometimes in a negative manner... probably the loving manner is the origin though.

[2022-12-31 01:45:37] <Naliina> @ShayTheBean Do you think it's possible the reason men, originally named their most intimate vehicles a female name, was because they were taught to be sturdy and emotionless?

[2022-12-31 02:05:09] <Naliina> Since you mentioned your doggo's unfortunate state, I feel it'd be fair to share one from my older Yorkie. She was abused as well. Her leg got yanked so hard by her previous owners, it broke her connection between her hip-bone and thigh. She was abused and was always scared. Now she's still scared of a lot of things BUT she's no longer miserable.

[2022-12-31 02:07:45] <Naliina> Yeah the hip and the femur needed an operation to fix.

[2022-12-31 02:18:33] <%+SilvyrSphere> oh yeah
[2022-12-31 02:18:47] <creeprgenesis> Would you adopt?
[2022-12-31 02:18:58] <Naliina> That's a separate thing.
[2022-12-31 02:18:58] <%ShayTheBean> you know what else can heal? That little piece of skin in a woman that breaks the first time. It can heal over again.

[2022-12-31 02:19:33] <Naliina> I'd say it should be normal to adopt but I'm also of the opinion that we should instate a law for number of humans born on this planet. We've already over-populated to an absurd level.

[2022-12-31 02:20:57] <%ThatchRoofedCottage> Also the hymen isn't what people think it is.... shitty sex ed makes you think it's like the seal on a yogurt cup.  It's more like the skin between your thumb and first finger, it's an arch of tight flesh and if you're GENTLE it shouldn't ever break
[2022-12-31 02:20:57] <Naliina> Adoption should be difficult but it should be the norm.

There were major complications and I didn't get enough oxygen or nutrients during the whole pregnancy, and then 2 weeks early the uterus just detached itself entirely and my mom almost miscarried me... so yeah I had a traumatic entrance into the world. I was born blue
