[2022-12-20 06:55:52] <%+DrWhat86> Druid is my unloved class in arena
[2022-12-20 06:56:12] <+iiM_KeZ> Those patch notes and buffing DK for ladder looks like it‚Äôs gonna be even more insufferable in arena lol

[2022-12-20 07:00:19] <%^Nightbot> help redbeard come up with some dumb titles for youtube https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx87TDgwE8L9Mqbs_2D5EjxpwKt2wdZglq8ukMyDHLUlDWDQ/viewform
[2022-12-20 07:00:57] <+Khanectomy> Hey RB idk if you watched or someone else already told you but Lorinda gave you a shout out during World finals. there were random minions on Bunnyhoppor's side and he said something like "i wonder what RedBeard thinks when he sees this board."
[2022-12-20 07:01:00] <%StarsyNA> is this a pre adjustment deck?
[2022-12-20 07:01:35] <%StarsyNA> yeah huge change tbh, I had a 2 win DK earlier which is significantly lower than the 3 wins I had been averaging before..
[2022-12-20 07:01:44] <%StarsyNA> I hate to say it but the gravy train has left the station
[2022-12-20 07:02:18] VIEWERS: 61
[2022-12-20 07:02:28] <+the_true_artful_dodger> nah DK is still by far the most powerful class
[2022-12-20 07:02:49] <+mattycharchar> I barely know what I‚Äôm doing, and I have a live 6-0 DK run for my first time ever drafting a DK.
[2022-12-20 07:03:17] <+the_true_artful_dodger> nerfs didn't do much, buffs were even less impactful
[2022-12-20 07:03:38] <its_mr_bass> How's the beard today Mr. Red?

[2022-12-20 07:04:48] <%StarsyNA> seems like the changes should have made a difference.. they stripped all the discovered scourges out of the class

[2022-12-20 07:06:34] <%StarsyNA> huh Dreads spent alot of his stream complaining about how it was still impossible to get more than a handful of wins with some of the classes
[2022-12-20 07:06:39] <%+DrWhat86> i Told him alread, but he ignored me in shame

[2022-12-20 07:08:28] <%dinklejam> so the dk balance made it even better for arena it seems
[2022-12-20 07:08:33] <%StarsyNA> I don't think i've seen the cool new Sylvanus portrait yet :(
[2022-12-20 07:08:42] <loopglass> have u tried turning down the 4 Watt setting?
[2022-12-20 07:09:13] <%dinklejam> ohhh lowered appearance.  I thought with the buffs it would be worse
[2022-12-20 07:09:26] <+the_true_artful_dodger> seems like discover cards were the only cards nerfed in terms of appearance rate. Rune cards seem to still appear with reasonable frequency
[2022-12-20 07:09:27] <%StarsyNA> yeah that was my first thought too dinklejam
[2022-12-20 07:09:58] <%+SixGingerKids> all the other classes are way better now!!!!! (i swear)
[2022-12-20 07:10:02] <%StarsyNA> they didn't really explain what they changed too thoroughly but they said in broad terms that they removed cards that generate other cards for DK.. or atleast made them much more rare to draft

[2022-12-20 07:21:50] <%Kaguyavn> both that card and pally needs to f right off

[2022-12-20 07:22:49] <%Synastar> So hopefully u won‚Äôt see much more of it

[2022-12-20 07:26:49] <disssen> been watching a lot, and you know Simpsons trivia and episodes etc. but you've never mentioned Futurama. what's up with that
[2022-12-20 07:27:37] <%+Thehomedemon360> it‚Äôs a 5 mana improved twisting nether
[2022-12-20 07:27:39] <%3Lyra> Explosion is something you really want the ability to discover if needed, but drafting it isn't too great
[2022-12-20 07:27:40] <%+Thehomedemon360> it‚Äôs situational
[2022-12-20 07:27:53] <%+Thehomedemon360> but it‚Äôs good at what it does

[2022-12-20 07:33:19] <!%deformedboogie> I thought you are not mad at me because of disrespecting the uber driver
[2022-12-20 07:33:24] <%Synastar> I think you could play any game and gain an audience as long as you weren‚Äôt awful
[2022-12-20 07:33:27] <%StarsyNA> the taunt thing can use itself as a corpse right?
[2022-12-20 07:33:34] <%StarsyNA> for the deathrattle?
[2022-12-20 07:33:35] <+basedthola> right you wanna play fun interesting decks
[2022-12-20 07:33:51] <disssen> I don't think DK got hit as hard in arena because it got buffed and nerfed. if you snag some buffed cards, you're just as strong.
[2022-12-20 07:34:13] <%StarsyNA> i guess so :)

[2022-12-20 07:37:43] <disssen> arena could definitely get with the times. draft in MTG has been a thing for 20 years. drafting 40 cards to make a 20 card deck is the best part of draft @redbeard

[2022-12-20 07:38:56] <@%Tazny> From what Ive heard MTG seems to value long term goals and HS seems to value short term goals
[2022-12-20 07:39:05] <disssen> did they just kind of abandon the bucket system or just muck it up

[2022-12-20 07:42:06] <@%Tazny> Oh yeah no doubt HS has been a huge success, its just the quality is decreasing in recent years and its not as popular as it once was
[2022-12-20 07:42:10] <%StarsyNA> they are going to go back and fix the original mistake
[2022-12-20 07:42:25] <%nekrotoon> problem is, i am not a fan of snap and i don't want to go back to mtg...

[2022-12-20 07:43:51] <%StarsyNA> @nekrotoon the good news is the bazaar is definitely coming out in 2023
[2022-12-20 07:44:02] <%nekrotoon> any recommendations of other up and coming new card games with draft mechanics out there?
[2022-12-20 07:44:07] <%StarsyNA> it will be literally a perfect game
[2022-12-20 07:44:14] <brightside2016> does snap have anywhere near  the same depth as hs? havent played it but it seems simplistic
[2022-12-20 07:44:17] <%+doctorsauceman> Is part of the fun of marvel snap figuring out when you‚Äôre ahead to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù and maximize cubes?

[2022-12-20 07:45:05] <%StarsyNA> @doctorsauceman I think that's a crucial part of the game yes.. it's a wagering system plastered on top of the core gameplay

[2022-12-20 07:45:39] <disssen> @next__88 dk is way more spikey because they nerfed offer rates but buffed like 8 cards, s

[2022-12-20 07:56:56] <%+Jurbek> that meta felt like this meta pre nerf no? one class to rule them all style... fun when u play that class not when u dont?
[2022-12-20 07:56:59] <%$bbart2412> I honestly think they should hire you as an arena expert for balancing. They totally do not get what the arena players would like to experience...
[2022-12-20 07:57:04] <$littleladykitten> felt good beating DK's and it felt good drafting dk
[2022-12-20 07:57:27] <%+TennisDamo> fun ashtrays should be the goal and balance is a only a portion of what makes up fun
[2022-12-20 07:57:35] <%+TennisDamo> fun always*
[2022-12-20 07:57:39] <%zeddtinn> I was okay before the changes, at least there were 2 decks fun to play, now what?

[2022-12-20 08:05:35] <+basedthola> so the people who spend money have someone else to interact with, great point
[2022-12-20 08:05:36] <%uhhitsJon> Keeping Arena alive solely to compete with other card game's drafting modes is reason enough to have it from Blizz's perspective
[2022-12-20 08:05:44] <$littleladykitten> @ACGsteve these days its a planned obsolete idea
[2022-12-20 08:05:44] <%StarsyNA> all the people producing quality products got pushed out of the market long ago :(
[2022-12-20 08:05:44] <%zeddtinn> how many of you would still play Arena if it cost you money, say a $6 monthly sub for example?
[2022-12-20 08:05:49] <%nekrotoon> maybe a cool idea would have been to make a dk only draft, but you choose at the beginning which draft pool you will have available, depending on the runes
[2022-12-20 08:05:51] <%StarsyNA> cell phone games are the order of the day now
[2022-12-20 08:06:14] <%+NExt__88> id glady play $6 a month for unlimited arena's and better meta

[2022-12-20 08:11:07] <%StarsyNA> It was kind of strange wrt: Zeddy... he would change decks and every time the loading screen would stutter and it would load in a direct counter to his deck
[2022-12-20 08:11:15] <%$ESY16> Do you think it would be worth experimenting to have an arena system where your first 5 (or so) picks are always from among class cards to sort of jump start a draft and then the rest of the cards follow the usual offerings?
[2022-12-20 08:11:23] <!%ChibbaTron> doing so now. I've not played a run in this meta yet. just unlocked DK and then didn't get him in my arena run and logged out lol
[2022-12-20 08:11:45] <%StarsyNA> and by strange i mean fucking hilarious watching him blow his stack lol

[2022-12-20 08:19:52] <%+doctorsauceman> The type of complaining changes depending on how egregious the mistakes of HS arena are. Sunken city people complained about colossals, but the synergies were there for multiple classes. Dual class was awful for so many reasons and the degree of complaining reflected that
