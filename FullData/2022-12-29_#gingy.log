[2022-12-29 00:01:38] <olternaut> @rednecrikky building a new PC...got all the parts.  I will build it first, set up new OS on a m.2 drive. after windows installed then i want to move the old raid 0 drives and plug into the new system with standard SATA cables.
[2022-12-29 00:01:58] <Mynar_Moonshadow> @olternaut Is the raid made by spanning disks via windows or is there some other software being used to manage the raid?
[2022-12-29 00:02:02] <olternaut> @rednecrikky I'm hoping it will simply recognized the raid 0
[2022-12-29 00:02:17] <%+johnkepton> Yeah that’s fair
[2022-12-29 00:02:18] <olternaut> @Mynar_Moonshadow no it was simple windows
[2022-12-29 00:02:19] <parenthesisrl> i got a raid ill be back
[2022-12-29 00:02:21] <@%Philbo> Hi Gingy! Wipe is great so far, i'm loving streets! I only got to level 4 and then i went to sleep for a 3 hour nap. i've been up since 5am for BSG cast

[2022-12-29 00:02:36] <%$rednecrikky> @olternaut i dont think it will unless you take your current os with it i believe
[2022-12-29 00:02:38] <@%Philbo> So now i'm all coffee'd up and ready to rock

[2022-12-29 00:03:01] <Mynar_Moonshadow> @olternaut The it should recognize it just fine.  Just don't reinitialize the array or you will lose all the data.
[2022-12-29 00:03:07] <olternaut> @rednecrikky see, I was hoping it would simply recognize the raid 0.
[2022-12-29 00:03:10] <@%^Nightbot> Hey chat do you want some great beef jerky? Check out https://empirejerky.com/discount/Gingy and use code GINGY for 10% off your order.
[2022-12-29 00:03:35] <olternaut> @Mynar_Moonshadow I just want to plug them in.  I don't want to mess with anything else.
[2022-12-29 00:03:47] <@%Philbo> yeah i waited back2back 10 min raids so i decided that was the time for nap
[2022-12-29 00:04:02] <olternaut> *kisses Gingy on forehead*  Hope you feel better!  :D

[2022-12-29 00:04:11] <+thefirstcow> hello, where is the best place for gas analyzers?
[2022-12-29 00:04:14] <%$rednecrikky> @olternaut i think what is recognizing the raid 0 is the os if you can bring it along it would just plug and play like if you move copy of os to m.2
[2022-12-29 00:04:27] <Mynar_Moonshadow> @olternaut yup.  Go ahead and plug them in .. if it doesn't recognize the array or if it wants to reinit the array, then just stop, turn it off, and plug them back into the old computer and migrate the data off.
[2022-12-29 00:04:38] <@%Philbo> Interchange best map
[2022-12-29 00:04:41] <olternaut> @rednecrikky well it's a new system I'm builing.  I will get a new windows 10 key online somewhere.

[2022-12-29 01:02:30] <pewpewchris1381> We had a 3 man coming out of woods towards UN Roadblock. There was a single scav, laying down waiting to ambush anyone that went near that big ditch en route to the extract. He killed two of us, we both had hit him multiple times and the 3rd man killed him after again, unloading on him

[2022-12-29 01:12:27] <%+Mahiingann> In the patch notes it mentions that SOME quest items now have random spawn locations, though they will more or less be in the same area

[2022-12-29 01:22:00] <%+ogjoker88> I think all the new people are wanting to run scav and not pmc so its making a que for scav
[2022-12-29 01:22:07] <iacewheeler> I have the same problem
[2022-12-29 01:22:13] <davelmn> servers are overloaded for streets

[2022-12-29 01:24:03] <lozzz03> How you finding the audio in game?
[2022-12-29 01:24:19] <iacewheeler> I been having like 50 frames recently so strange
[2022-12-29 01:24:24] <!%+sub2dex> Audio is weird!!
[2022-12-29 01:24:33] <+sofa_king_lzy> not good to do restart with windows
[2022-12-29 01:24:49] <+sofa_king_lzy> shut down and start back up is best
[2022-12-29 01:24:52] <+nazzrai> You can look at installed updates and revert any changes through windows
[2022-12-29 01:24:52] <lozzz03> Audio has been the same for me
[2022-12-29 01:25:00] <%+ogjoker88> Did you turn the binaural audio back on that they are using again?
[2022-12-29 01:25:02] <Trueuwu> @Gingy i think the game is having frame issues too tho, ive been getting significantly lower frames too
[2022-12-29 01:25:08] <%+oregano_aouregan> that's what i thought. unless they were killing a ton post wipe.
[2022-12-29 01:25:09] <+sofa_king_lzy> its called edge of darkness version
[2022-12-29 01:25:13] <flame_hunter997> EOD edition starts you with a bunch of gear.
[2022-12-29 01:25:14] <%+ogjoker88> they said in the patch notes to turn it on for best performence

[2022-12-29 01:25:24] <%+ReK_42> @gingy then do an actual restart. Modern windows doesn't fully shutdown, it's more like the old hibernate, so it boots faster next time. Actual "restart" can solve some problems
[2022-12-29 01:25:25] <Trueuwu> oof
[2022-12-29 01:25:29] <Trueuwu> good luck

[2022-12-29 01:26:02] <iacewheeler> I mean streets is very un optimised
[2022-12-29 01:26:03] <%+ogjoker88> then i turned it on and it fixed it

[2022-12-29 01:28:00] <davelmn> today all players have frame issues on the streets, so it is a server problem
[2022-12-29 01:28:00] <+TheToefinger> yeah i dont fix my own pc either its just not worth me fucking something else up
[2022-12-29 01:28:01] <phazeoce> how about we move on from the subject chat :)

[2022-12-29 14:23:55] <%+ogjoker88> Drip is a term to refer to someone's cool sense of style. Hip-hop culture popularized the term, and it gained popularity as a way to describe a person's impressive and trendy appearance. Drip can apply to clothing, shoes, jewelry, or just how someone carries themselves

[2022-12-29 16:26:41] <+Atrocity187> I set heavy bleed to 4 and light bleed to 5 so if I get a bleed. I just hit 4 and it’ll take care of the bleed, whether it’s heavy or light because 4 is press and 5 is activated on release of 4 @gingy
[2022-12-29 16:26:49] <%Blasphify> I’ve only found the machinery key so far

[2022-12-29 18:49:58] <%+deosilic> I take for early wipe money savings
[2022-12-29 18:50:01] <Opalak> Yeah, It can buff.
[2022-12-29 18:50:02] <%GorillaMonsoon25> depends on level of skill you have
[2022-12-29 18:50:04] <WhoseHughes> pretty sure mine was a grach from prapor</3
[2022-12-29 18:50:04] <%Maximum_3ffort> you have to get the skill up so might as well take it
[2022-12-29 18:50:06] <+mr_toxxxx> Add random bonuses to guns if you got the right amoujt of skill.
[2022-12-29 18:50:07] <%ogjoker88> at level 10 though are you even close?
[2022-12-29 18:50:10] <maw__99> Take it!! It got random mods to guns now
[2022-12-29 18:50:27] <%Aiyah4la> reason to loot scav guns now, to skill up repairs
[2022-12-29 18:50:31] <+Hansi189> take the cash into doc for space
[2022-12-29 18:50:33] <+TheMadHattr08> It makes sense, but little sad you need elite level for the rare buffs

[2022-12-29 19:01:04] <toxickarma838> but more players == less queue time right ?
[2022-12-29 19:01:06] <maw__99> @whosehughes the 1st drop is a “common crate” so don’t expect anything juicy… but people are getting anything from pile of meds, tt pistol, electric drill and so on

[2022-12-29 21:48:39] <%itsQueenMeep> You’re doing great let’s see some more adventuring on streets!! Woot woot
[2022-12-29 21:48:39] <%iamjlouis> I think that was a mix of bad audio, and haccccccker! Sound like he was coming to the door, but then when you could see him, he was in the distance
[2022-12-29 21:48:40] <tommytizzel> I think she reported because of the name, no?
[2022-12-29 21:48:42] <%itsQueenMeep> itsque17Love
[2022-12-29 21:48:45] <%BTurbo_is_TPC4L> Hackers typically protest that there are hackers.
[2022-12-29 21:48:47] <olternaut> @Tzakol_original i have to admit it did look weird
[2022-12-29 21:48:48] <pixalie> Honestly they need to add Kill cam like after Raid ends or something
[2022-12-29 21:48:54] <%CaerusBlue> she reported the name
[2022-12-29 21:48:56] <%+mechanicman396> Hopefully BSG tries harder on anticheat
[2022-12-29 21:48:58] <%StoneValleyKing> yall act like she doesnt have 11k hours on the game and can tell when its a hacker. She never calls it a hacker when she dies.
[2022-12-29 21:48:58] <%Buxbomber> they need to add kill cams with reporting
[2022-12-29 21:48:58] <%CaerusBlue> whatever the name was
[2022-12-29 21:48:59] <@%TrillOG_> i got the new SMG from my drop <3

[2022-12-29 22:12:11] <+Hoof_N_Mouth> some of the audio is flipped. You'll hear it on your left but the people are on your right
[2022-12-29 22:12:17] VIEWERS: 2 551
[2022-12-29 22:12:22] <%chumppi> yes but it's not implemented for Interchange, they haven't setup the sound so it's all mssed up.
[2022-12-29 22:12:24] <olternaut> you guys didn't expect there not to be bugs right?  I hear for the new audio to work they had to manually place audio cues on objects.
[2022-12-29 22:12:26] <%+MuseDz> and random noise that is not from around
[2022-12-29 22:12:28] <+jj700physics> So, for Tarbank quest, we checked the tarbank building (same street as construction, near the intersection) apparently there was no way to go inside  it, also we found tarbank van near cinema and damaged house,
[2022-12-29 22:12:29] <olternaut> someone was bound to mess something up
[2022-12-29 22:12:30] <%ogjoker88> When its on im fine if its off all audio is fucked
[2022-12-29 22:12:33] <%+Mahiingann> its because the new sound engine doesnt have occlusions zones for interchange yet
[2022-12-29 22:12:34] <%+mechanicman396> @hoof_n_mouth Same for me
[2022-12-29 22:12:44] <%Carrionx> i hear gun fights from buildings i'm no where near it's kinda dumb

[2022-12-29 22:12:53] <olternaut> yeah and they have to place thoes zones manually
[2022-12-29 22:12:57] <olternaut> they'll work it out.
[2022-12-29 22:12:58] <+ChrispyK> They turned off sound occlusion.  Instead of not hearing people on different floors, you can hear people as if no walls existed

[2022-12-29 23:23:54] <%chumppi> It's true, your body reacts to it as if it was sugar and spikes your blood sugar levels.
[2022-12-29 23:23:59] <@%+jimmiedrum> mentally, like 13
[2022-12-29 23:24:03] <goldendragon11> If you have diabetes, stevia could be a way to sweeten your yogurt or hot tea without adding carbohydrates.
[2022-12-29 23:24:07] <%ragnar112> would call that too @Sapper04 or about there

[2022-12-29 23:25:16] <omega5336> i am a diabetic myself @Gingy  basically the reason they are not allowed it is cause it still contains some amount carbs or natural "sweet" it will still mess you up a little , and they probably have it like once or twice a day or are a Type 2 , i myself as a type 1 cant have it all

[2022-12-29 23:25:25] <%$FadedNerdGaming> It doesn't spike your blood sugar. What you are thinking of is the taste of sugar in your mouth makes your body think you are going to get some sugar and when you don't it causes you to crave sugar.
