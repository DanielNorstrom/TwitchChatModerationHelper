[2022-12-19 13:31:00] <Sax850> I've played tabletops and D&D since I was 13, turning 30 next year. I've been a forever GM for D&D 5e for about 8 years... But I finally get to be a player since I convinced a player trying to be a GM and its been fun! But I don't GM D&D/Pathfinder anymore, I GM/run Traveller or specifically Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition, its a Firefly/Serenity/Similar Sci-Fi Tabletop that I love.

[2022-12-19 13:34:58] <%$Krypsyn> @Canslli I think it was mainly that I didn't get enough immersion.  I did very well on the written, and my accent was not horrible, but I could never follow what people were saying.  (It got so bad, one of my college teachers thought I was cheating, because I would get perfect scores on the written, but fail the orals every time.)

[2022-12-19 13:47:18] <Calintares> In an earlier version, it was interpreted as the cat drinking four whole units of beer, and since they have no alcohol tolerance it would kill them.

[2022-12-19 14:00:57] <+Telear> Blueprints don't let you copy/paste, they just let you lay out your fort in advance so you don't go crashing into the moat you haven't finished digging yet.
[2022-12-19 14:01:07] <ZaZiiZu> macros are easy but somewhat limited I think. they only record keystrokes (so you have to 'draw' with keyboard). takes a bit to get used to

[2022-12-19 14:02:06] <+Telear> Exactly. They don't do repeatable chunks of layout, they just help you not mess up stuff that's been planned for a long time.

[2022-12-19 14:04:17] <+Telear> So you can kind of repeat the stairwell pattern all the way down by adding in z-level changes as part of your drawing.
[2022-12-19 14:04:30] VIEWERS: 482
[2022-12-19 14:04:51] <+Telear> If you designate the stairs last, you don't even have to wait for stairs to be dug.
[2022-12-19 14:05:09] <+Telear> Just layout the mining, and then drill down through it with the stairwell cross.

[2022-12-19 15:28:50] <ArgentumSound> Thank you!
[2022-12-19 15:29:18] <%Silvertunga> Soap IRL is made from lye+fat+water, anything more is just whatever additives people want to make it more fragrant or pretty. So it's more complicated in the game than IRL.
[2022-12-19 15:29:28] <jabberwoocky> Great ! thanks
[2022-12-19 15:29:51] <Neroxen_> @Silvertunga But its the same exact resources in the game?

[2022-12-19 15:30:00] <%Silvertunga> @Silvertunga Needed ash as well?
[2022-12-19 15:30:10] <VeruMamo> ash is needed to make lye
[2022-12-19 15:30:15] <VeruMamo> then you need tallow and lye
[2022-12-19 15:30:25] <VeruMamo> tallow is derived from animal fat in the butchers

[2022-12-19 15:58:03] <VeruMamo> heavier materials are best only because marksdwarves will mostly not shoot people and try to bludgeon them with the crossbow

[2022-12-19 15:58:16] <+slippry_john> If you have any silver or copper, those are better materials for crossbows

[2022-12-19 16:03:34] <VeruMamo> who will alert you to intruders
[2022-12-19 16:03:47] <+Exoltik> Generally better to have a bunch of traps in the entrance hallway. Cage traps, rockfall traps. They'll automatically trigger on a hostile entity entering that tile
[2022-12-19 16:03:49] <VeruMamo> patrolling, iirc, doesn't improve their skills
[2022-12-19 16:04:05] <VeruMamo> goblin thieves are trap immune I think
[2022-12-19 16:04:21] <VeruMamo> but a dog stationed in the middle of a 3x hall will observe a thief

[2022-12-19 16:21:16] <KillMolly> Would VR affect it tooÉ
[2022-12-19 16:21:17] <Lord_Nightmare> does disabling antialiasing or especially disabling time based antialiasing help? and running the game in a lower resolution?
[2022-12-19 16:21:35] <VeruMamo> very curious about the biomechanical causes
[2022-12-19 16:21:37] <SirLansolot> have you tried putting a dark circle around the screen borders and playing?
[2022-12-19 16:21:39] <VeruMamo> imma look into this
[2022-12-19 16:21:57] <SirLansolot> it works in VR for motion sickness, just a thought
[2022-12-19 16:21:58] <Lord_Nightmare> TXAA/TAA antialiasing gives me a headache and makes evrything swimmy

[2022-12-19 16:22:25] <Lord_Nightmare> I personally find it easier to turn off antialiasing and live with the jaggies

[2022-12-19 16:22:37] <%+joehungers> Does dimenhydrinate (common brand name Dramamine) offer any symptom relief for simulation sickness?
[2022-12-19 16:22:40] <jabberwoocky> and i mean i like booze
[2022-12-19 16:22:44] <+Carkan> maybe he didn't drink alcohol as well?
[2022-12-19 16:22:45] <SirLansolot> yeahh same with me

[2022-12-19 16:22:55] <%+essi2> Sounds bad, I can usually compensate by changing FoV, disabling Blur etc. but some games are beyond helping. Sim sickness is why I first went to my optician

[2022-12-19 16:23:08] <Shagiwog> I can't play any first person view game without getting motion sickness... forget VR
[2022-12-19 16:23:22] <VeruMamo> I wonder if its related to proprioception in general, related to hypermobility or POTS
[2022-12-19 16:23:27] <Lord_Nightmare> it could also be a werewalrus ate them or something
[2022-12-19 16:24:07] <VeruMamo> it's motion sickness medicine
[2022-12-19 16:24:16] <$Elarcis> Something I did to get water once was dig an underground channel towards the river and put a well above the collecting pool.
[2022-12-19 16:24:19] <VeruMamo> usually used by people for long car rides
[2022-12-19 16:24:31] <$Elarcis> … I don’t recommend it, my fortress was later flooded, for unknown reasons
[2022-12-19 16:24:38] <braphoggers> I don't know how anyone can tolerate motion blur under any circumstance
[2022-12-19 16:24:51] <VeruMamo> my wife uses those
[2022-12-19 16:24:52] <%+joehungers> dimenhydrinate is the ingredient, it's an antihistamine
[2022-12-19 16:24:57] <CansecoDev> Beat Saber is a masterpiece example of a VR game that exploits the technology very well not just because of the motionless status but also not expecting feedback from the controllers

[2022-12-19 16:25:33] <Lord_Nightmare> my favorite is when you make a long set of magma forges around the rim of the lava level of the volcano, only for the level to rise and flood your fortress with magma
[2022-12-19 16:25:38] <specturo> @Elarcis if the riverlvl is above ur well you get a problem
[2022-12-19 16:25:39] <@%imperfectionistimp> Kiri, with parallax, what alterative works for you? Just completely disabled motion? Or is there anything that works as a compromise?  Because I have motion sickness too, but parallax doesn't tend to bother me.
[2022-12-19 16:25:41] <%Silvertunga> @Elarcis Unknown, unrelated reasons.
[2022-12-19 16:25:48] <VeruMamo> be careful about making a well at a lower z-level than the source water
[2022-12-19 16:26:05] <$Elarcis> @Elarcis It wasn’t but I suspect ice to have displaced water and caused the flood
[2022-12-19 16:26:08] <VeruMamo> aquifers are the best for making self-filling wells

[2022-12-19 16:26:50] <SirLansolot> yes
[2022-12-19 16:27:04] <VeruMamo> parallax is the mathematical process by which your eyes use difference in motion to estimate difference
[2022-12-19 16:27:06] VIEWERS: 588
[2022-12-19 16:27:09] <@%imperfectionistimp> Parallax is when the background scrolls at a different rate so as to simulate motion with depth of field.
[2022-12-19 16:27:10] <%Silvertunga> Parallax in games is when several 2D planes move at different rates.
[2022-12-19 16:27:12] <VeruMamo> distance rather
[2022-12-19 16:27:19] <Lord_Nightmare> parallax is when the background moves at a slower or faster rate
[2022-12-19 16:27:23] <Lord_Nightmare> usually in several layers
[2022-12-19 16:27:25] <@%imperfectionistimp> Yeah, fair enough, thanks Kiri.
[2022-12-19 16:27:36] <SirLansolot> I have very bad motion sickness but luckily it doesnt bleed into gaming
[2022-12-19 16:27:40] <Lord_Nightmare> and usually slower, to give the illusion of depth (like in shovel knight)
[2022-12-19 16:27:44] <Shivur> Yes it's when the camera move laterally but doesn't turn.
[2022-12-19 16:27:50] <$Elarcis> Yes, objects afar move slower in your field of vision, this phenomenon is generally called parallax, and video games emulate it
[2022-12-19 16:27:53] <@%imperfectionistimp> Screenshake and motion blur and all that sort of thing does me in, but not parallax, for some reason.
[2022-12-19 16:27:59] <CansecoDev> Winter is great because there is not plants causing me to sneeze and there is not a hellish hot sun during the best day hours CurseLit
[2022-12-19 16:28:01] <+TelinArtho> yup - just keep going down
[2022-12-19 16:28:03] <Lord_Nightmare> but sometimes faster to give the illusion that the platform you're standing on is moving quickly like a train level in some beat em up games
[2022-12-19 16:28:05] <$Elarcis> But it’s also called like this IRL and can be used to measure distance to stars and stuff
[2022-12-19 16:28:08] <Lord_Nightmare> or metal slug
[2022-12-19 16:28:23] <+TelinArtho> once you find a cave "pop" - you'll sense it

Or just hang on tight on that railing and I'll be fine. But seasickness me second weakness I dont have nothing for atm. Just avoid boats I gues.

[2022-12-19 16:29:01] <Lord_Nightmare> parallax was used rarely on NES and Gameboy games; its used notably in battletoads on NES and on the cave levels in shantae on the gameboy

[2022-12-19 16:29:13] <$Elarcis> Haven’t had one of those yet
[2022-12-19 16:29:25] <SirLansolot> if you play old SNES games, you can turn off the parallax layer with snes9x
[2022-12-19 16:30:01] <@%imperfectionistimp> Love the cave noises
[2022-12-19 16:30:06] <Lord_Nightmare> the reason it was rarely used on nes and gameboy is that they only have one background layer, so doing true parallax requires some very complicated 'demoscene' style tricks
[2022-12-19 16:30:12] <CansecoDev> Will they require some archery ranges?
[2022-12-19 16:30:14] <$Elarcis> Surprisingly, having to redraw the whole background of your game everytime the player moves wasn’t nice to early game consoles’ chips
[2022-12-19 16:30:30] <Lord_Nightmare> while the SNES has up to 4 background layers (in the rarely used 'mode 0') so it makes parallax easy
[2022-12-19 16:30:46] <%grugenvids> Haha Nice design Idea!
[2022-12-19 16:30:48] <Shivur> Me I get sickness when the colors are too saturated. For instance I got sickness playing terraria but not starbound.

[2022-12-19 16:30:49] <jabberwoocky> it looks  like one
[2022-12-19 16:30:53] <Lord_Nightmare> the sega genesis/megadrive uses a framebuffer but it has a cpu fast enough to EMULATE parallax, as was done in the sonic the hedgehog games
[2022-12-19 16:31:02] <ZaZiiZu> could draw an arrow with Floor tiles. then room doesnt have to look 'that' weird

[2022-12-19 16:58:36] <%+Agion59> animal breeding is a bit complicated. Chickens, as a non-grazing animal, can be placed in a room inside the fortress with  nest boxes. Make sure to lock them in them in otherwise the dwarves will eat all the eggs before they hatch.

[2022-12-19 17:21:49] <@%imperfectionistimp> A catchment in nature is the area that a watercourse receives rainwater from. In human geography, it refers to the area that people and/or resources can be drawn from. Schools, for example, will often have a catchment area defining the zone within which you have to live in order to send your children to that school.

[2022-12-19 17:27:57] <!%rselbo> we need to bribe mystery to turn up the volume on the boo command to scare kiri a bit more
[2022-12-19 17:28:12] <Lothian_Waltheof_II> what these fan-overhaul patches can milk out of a '94 game, hot-damn

[2022-12-19 17:33:35] <+RebBr0wn> I've done everything there's to do in the game, so no - though hopefully now more people can enjoy it :)

[2022-12-19 17:35:33] <!%FirebirdLover> There is one more important piece you need to understand: number of figures in the unit
[2022-12-19 17:35:51] <icosaeder> Yeah you angered them.

[2022-12-19 17:36:02] <+RebBr0wn> spells dont have 'range', no - I do think ranged attacks from units get a penalty if enemies are far away
[2022-12-19 17:36:06] <!%FirebirdLover> Every FIGURE has 3 attack and 4 health. So, the unit has 12 attack and 16 health

[2022-12-19 17:44:07] <Troodis> It was educational. SeemsGood
[2022-12-19 17:44:15] <+RebBr0wn> the game makes dice rolls for everything in combat - they probably roll for each point of fire damage, and got a little lucky to only take 3
