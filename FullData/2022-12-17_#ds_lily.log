[2022-12-17 00:54:12] <TreantGamer> your body at some point rejects sugar and it'll make you sick
[2022-12-17 00:54:20] <!%Amidore> FIGHTER
[2022-12-17 00:54:56] <TreantGamer> also insulin resistance is bad so don't get fat
[2022-12-17 00:55:00] <%LordTekkless> ill go barb
[2022-12-17 00:55:10] <%LordTekkless> so the gear share is easier
[2022-12-17 00:55:11] <!%Amidore> I think fighter easiest
[2022-12-17 00:55:12] <Angellaps> Necro is simpler to gear and more defensive
[2022-12-17 00:55:14] <skillformon3y> Guardian is more beefy Right ?
