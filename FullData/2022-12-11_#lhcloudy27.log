[2022-12-11 15:19:16] <%+Slapo0> RIP no gm. Banned too soon
[2022-12-11 15:19:17] <%+Skar_> lhcloudyExplain flame rein guy
[2022-12-11 15:19:18] <tirdni> why is your chat flaming you
[2022-12-11 15:19:28] <endcosmos> tanks fault of course
[2022-12-11 15:19:29] <%MilkmanHopkins> you are shielding too much
[2022-12-11 15:19:53] <Insektkongen> high diamond/low masters is the most toxic of any rank in my experience
[2022-12-11 15:19:59] <%Kakaobob> finally kiriko
[2022-12-11 15:20:22] <tirdni> there is no t500 challenger tho
[2022-12-11 15:20:29] <%WinstonsNK> good afternoon mr cloud lets go
[2022-12-11 15:20:40] <mixeryow> Its so dumb that they „reset“ the rank
[2022-12-11 15:20:41] <%+Skar_> big dick is bronze 5 , it's harder to get that
[2022-12-11 15:20:54] <tirdni> i cant pay attention, im vibing to the music
[2022-12-11 15:21:07] <mixeryow> I dont even loss my rank i climbed with placement games
[2022-12-11 15:21:14] <mixeryow> So that mean im a gigachad
[2022-12-11 15:21:23] <+sabre5395> agreed
[2022-12-11 15:22:15] <+sabre5395> all the gold 5 players sent to low silver/high bronze :(
[2022-12-11 15:22:23] <Skurt2k> doesn't make sense if you don't play this season, your rank will go down 5 divisions again but your mmr is the same????
[2022-12-11 15:22:45] <%Kakaobob> what happened to silver and bronze players? they also dropped?
[2022-12-11 15:22:57] <tokekberacun> @Skurt2k yes but lets say u went 7-7 u can still rank up
[2022-12-11 15:22:58] <%GIRLinMaleBody> lilaggAYAYA
[2022-12-11 15:23:00] <+sabre5395> it should naturally decay the less you play
[2022-12-11 15:23:24] <Saltysmigma> if you only place will you bronze 1
[2022-12-11 15:23:32] <%GIRLinMaleBody> Streaming torb just cums
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <Skurt2k> so you say if you are gm and don't play for 6 season your rank is bronze?
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <tokekberacun> !whiff
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <@^Nightbot> Cloudy has whiffed 1060 shatters
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <+sabre5395> Yeah this is waaay too overtuned, and just seems artificial.
[2022-12-11 15:24:29] <%resourcefulperlo> does thee mmr buff stays long or not?
[2022-12-11 15:24:46] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @resourcefulperlo i think mmr stays forever until u start losing hard
[2022-12-11 15:25:00] <Ameeba37> pepeJAM catJAM
[2022-12-11 15:25:08] <%+Aceattack> !uptime

[2022-12-11 15:25:18] <%+Aceattack> greetings!
[2022-12-11 15:25:19] <%resourcefulperlo> oooooh
[2022-12-11 15:25:21] <tokekberacun> if ur on high mmr but low rank it kinda tolerates ur loss
[2022-12-11 15:25:23] <%resourcefulperlo> ok
[2022-12-11 15:25:26] <tirdni> oh good thing i lost just 9 in a row
[2022-12-11 15:25:30] <Saltysmigma> i miss seeing the avg sr of lobbies
[2022-12-11 15:25:36] <mixeryow> My money dont jiggle jiggle it folds
[2022-12-11 15:25:54] <%resourcefulperlo> agreed but top 500 sr
[2022-12-11 15:26:07] <tokekberacun> i had 12 lost streak yesterday and just deranked from plat 5 to g1 only(i expected way lower tho)
[2022-12-11 15:26:15] <+sabre5395> In Rocket League knowing your teammates SR is totally fine, the Overwatch community is just waaay more toxic
[2022-12-11 15:26:27] <mixeryow> But actually you can see your teammates sr with this „master challenger, diamond challenger“ so its useless
[2022-12-11 15:26:37] <%anfieldow> @LhCloudy27 cloudy you matched up with that ana in nepal again? the gymbod guy?
[2022-12-11 15:26:44] <%+Aceattack> hiding the sr just hides problems with matchmaking because mmr can be 500+ than sr on a given day
[2022-12-11 15:26:51] <tirdni> i want Bronze Challanger
[2022-12-11 15:26:55] <%GIRLinMaleBody> i will know theyre shit and wont trust them much
[2022-12-11 15:27:11] <EmBRan> who to pocket KEKW
[2022-12-11 15:27:22] <mixeryow> If i know someone is lower sr for example gold and the other dps is diamond, im gonna pocket the diamond more
[2022-12-11 15:27:24] <sustavo0> yea but atleast u know who u should ignore
[2022-12-11 15:27:24] <poopypants099> hello
[2022-12-11 15:27:24] <mixeryow> For example
[2022-12-11 15:27:26] <Skurt2k> this ranking system is way too consufing. I think they should go back to game developer school
[2022-12-11 15:27:28] <%resourcefulperlo> Im just going to play qp until hog gets nerfed
[2022-12-11 15:27:43] <%resourcefulperlo> I just reach gm and then Im out
[2022-12-11 15:27:44] <Skurt2k> incompetent people
[2022-12-11 15:28:04] <%GIRLinMaleBody> tracer is feed
[2022-12-11 15:28:04] <%YoungsterGlenn> CLOUDY
[2022-12-11 15:28:10] <Saltysmigma> have you noticed the matchmaking changes
[2022-12-11 15:28:13] <mixeryow> Do you think its easier to get diamond now than ow1
[2022-12-11 15:28:33] <tokekberacun> its the same, they just want you to get addicted
[2022-12-11 15:28:44] <%+Skar_> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 15:28:53] <%+Aceattack> every season will have a meta so complaining about meta is just counter productive at this point
[2022-12-11 15:29:01] <mixeryow> Hog ult vs a non shielding rein should be a freewin
[2022-12-11 15:29:03] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @mixeryow diamond is super easy to get but takes little longer, cuz game cant place u higher than plat5, in ow1 u could place straight into 3400
[2022-12-11 15:29:41] <%minounn> soj is balanced guys 4Head
[2022-12-11 15:29:43] <sustavo0> sojurn is still 1v5 in my lobbies OMEGALUL  nice "nerf" there is just mercy dmg boost every game now
[2022-12-11 15:29:52] <+sabre5395> There's always room for improvement, even if sometimes making changes has unintended consequences
[2022-12-11 15:29:54] <peeposhell> Rank system sucks but balancing is the bigger issue
[2022-12-11 15:29:57] <%Biofuze> hmmMeeting
[2022-12-11 15:30:01] <@%aidreu> Do kill kill kill!!
[2022-12-11 15:30:15] <%+Aceattack> no i meant not playing ranked because of meta is not going to help personal growth
[2022-12-11 15:30:16] <mixeryow> Why did you not solo shatter hog?
[2022-12-11 15:30:19] <%resourcefulperlo> Im still waiting for the game to be at least a lil bit balenced
[2022-12-11 15:30:45] <%GIRLinMaleBody> sojourn 1v5
[2022-12-11 15:30:46] <%minounn> soj 1v5ing
[2022-12-11 15:30:49] <tokekberacun> soj kinda carried last fight
[2022-12-11 15:30:59] <@%aidreu> Dang
[2022-12-11 15:31:02] <@%aidreu> That was rly close
[2022-12-11 15:31:04] <sustavo0> nothinh has changeed about sj, she still  1v5 no problem
[2022-12-11 15:31:09] <%resourcefulperlo> @tokekberacun kiriko saved her from hook
[2022-12-11 15:31:10] <%kraandopOW> Good afternoon
[2022-12-11 15:31:12] <%resourcefulperlo> so its kiriko
[2022-12-11 15:31:13] <%+tahir2fast> whats ur win rate cloudy

[2022-12-11 15:31:21] <%Tjsb_gage_253> how we doing this morning?
[2022-12-11 15:31:29] <endcosmos> she's broken in every rank now
[2022-12-11 15:31:31] <%anfieldow> @LhCloudy27 you have the code for the ana that missed to see a dragon in nepal?
[2022-12-11 15:31:31] <ihelvete_> is it only this accountt that you are doing no shield?
[2022-12-11 15:31:32] <%GIRLinMaleBody> she is like 1% weaker than previous
[2022-12-11 15:31:32] <ihelvete_> account

[2022-12-11 15:31:52] <monkyyyyyyyyy> With a mercy pocket sojourns buffed
[2022-12-11 15:31:58] <sustavo0> it is just a lateral shift of power, sj is now even more accessible in lower rank players
[2022-12-11 15:32:12] <%anfieldow> england FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-11 15:32:20] <tirdni> bro with the support buffs, this game is unplayeable. the mercy jsut whips the gun so fast now
[2022-12-11 15:32:28] <%minounn> lower ranked players can spam bodyshot with ult now
[2022-12-11 15:32:28] <%mysstle> good morning
[2022-12-11 15:32:28] <%+Aceattack> they sacrifice a support to have mercy so overall might be fine for team comp
[2022-12-11 15:32:32] <%mysstle> lhcloudyLove
[2022-12-11 15:32:33] <+sabre5395> it's the true OW2 experience
[2022-12-11 15:32:35] <sustavo0> true KEKW
[2022-12-11 15:32:35] <%resourcefulperlo> they should try to understand that the ability to oneshot isnt the issue its the ability to have a slow in aoe who does damage and having a great mobility
[2022-12-11 15:32:51] <%resourcefulperlo> blizzard should...
[2022-12-11 15:32:51] <mixeryow> Mercys movement is just crazy
[2022-12-11 15:32:51] <endcosmos> they made her very hard to kill
[2022-12-11 15:32:54] <%GIRLinMaleBody> good mercy is impossible to kill
[2022-12-11 15:33:04] <sustavo0> mercy movement needs nerf, she is unkillable
[2022-12-11 15:33:04] <%gdddvibes> Good morning

[2022-12-11 15:37:48] <monkyyyyyyyyy> Thr dmg reduction on vape is broken i think
[2022-12-11 15:37:48] <%issallassi> In contenders they play orisa against hog
[2022-12-11 15:37:48] <+Xeffary> orisa's boring though, and mirror'ing hog is still a better option
[2022-12-11 15:37:48] <kingalba95> the q time is good today? Only 20 minutes?
[2022-12-11 15:37:48] <%gdddvibes> It’s a button mash character

[2022-12-11 15:38:54] <%+Aceattack> sr reset doesn’t reset mmr so it is perfectly fine. they want you to play more than 25 games in ranked
