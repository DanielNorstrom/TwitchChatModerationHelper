[2022-12-30 06:44:45] <%+WastingSanity> If you were soloing I would say damage and health... but since you have a full group... all damage.
[2022-12-30 06:44:45] <+raynorhunter> augmentations are not uncommon
[2022-12-30 06:44:46] <Joren456> they got power armor, thats all
[2022-12-30 06:44:47] <%+Nickkolas> Not like a space marine, no.

[2022-12-30 06:45:12] <Joren456> BUT, they do have some weird belief system
[2022-12-30 06:45:14] <%+Nickkolas> Not really, just their armor and some strong faith
[2022-12-30 06:45:15] <%+Zenzi_Aurora> no
[2022-12-30 06:45:25] <+raynorhunter> faith is what makes them so powerful
[2022-12-30 06:45:25] <%+WastingSanity> I do not believe so
[2022-12-30 06:45:26] <That_Steven_Guy> just the augments and training i think
[2022-12-30 06:45:29] <+True_King_In_Yellow> they use genetic de againg

[2022-12-30 06:46:40] <Joren456> the reason they arent fodder like guardsmen is the power armor

[2022-12-30 06:46:57] <+raynorhunter> their power armor is still way weaker than space marine armor
[2022-12-30 06:47:02] <That_Steven_Guy> Faith & Fire and Hammer & ANvil are the two Sisters novels I've read

[2022-12-30 07:15:47] <+Altyrian> this happened to me in a mission  is best to leave.
[2022-12-30 07:15:57] <%Varanid> there are some mission conditions where mobs wont suffer damage to hits that do below 'x' damage
[2022-12-30 07:15:58] <%+JaneInTheBox> but yes, this does kind of look like glitched
[2022-12-30 07:16:17] <%Varanid> you MUST read the mission conditions at start
[2022-12-30 07:16:23] <%+Maxheadspace> Didn't run rough-shod over the enemy.  it must be bugged

[2022-12-30 07:57:00] <$chazisop> to begin with, it is very likely that the game has an end date
[2022-12-30 07:57:15] <%OragamiSwamy> 'cause they can choose to no longer host the servers, and essentially prevent you from playing that even single player game.

[2022-12-30 07:57:31] <%StonerMk2> Im sure by the time they decide to close servers, they'll make it single players

[2022-12-30 07:59:52] <+Abberron> from what some are posting online, Neocore requires a separate neocore account and if their servers go down, you cant play, not so much your internet
[2022-12-30 07:59:54] <%+Korigan_Archangel> simple then just dont buy the game if it is such an issue
[2022-12-30 07:59:57] <Ezioxxauditore> also why would I support something like that
[2022-12-30 07:59:58] <+killerlithgow> It's one more moving part that can break.  My internet is inconsistent

[2022-12-30 08:01:57] <%OragamiSwamy> Happens more that a company goes under, game becomes unplayable until community has to make the "patch"
[2022-12-30 08:02:00] <%+Weezmeister> Should I buy this game? I'm afraid reality might sudden collapse on itself and effect my ability to play it.

[2022-12-30 08:02:02] <%Varanid> offline mode is an important thing imo. When I moved house, I had no internet for like 2 weeks but could play my games that had offline mode

[2022-12-30 08:03:32] <VrtniPatuljak> the reason is DRM
[2022-12-30 08:03:32] <%SMonTwitch> It’s just the type of game it is, if your net can’t support it, don’t play it. I don’t get this argument

[2022-12-30 08:03:42] <%Varanid> the game has PVP, Seasons, Leaderboards. Probably imprtant for online connectivity so people arent hacking shit? I dunno

[2022-12-30 08:03:50] <%OragamiSwamy> I never said that, I just agree that if a game must be connected to a server, a user run dedicated server should be available.. in order to prevent the possibility that the company stops running the servers.

[2022-12-30 08:07:13] <%GuardianAngelz> I'm literally just proving the point that it DOESNT need to be online.
[2022-12-30 08:07:19] <%+BlazneeX> I would even go so far as to say that's the biggest downside for me of Disney buying Marvel. Them shuttering Marvel Heroes.
[2022-12-30 08:07:33] <%BrosBroFisting> @xen_mind don't you think most pirates still support games by buying them after enjoying them so much for free?
[2022-12-30 08:07:35] <%Varanid> @gingytrucking I think they can open warp rifts and summon things accidentally and their 'Morality' skill tree is likely influenced by this? Havent played Psyker just yet

[2022-12-30 08:07:52] <$chazisop> @GuardianAngelz hence, it cannot be offline

[2022-12-30 08:08:07] <brol81> i think they did. like as soon as Disney brought Marvel
[2022-12-30 08:08:11] <Joren456> yes, got shut down by disney, so they could make their own version
[2022-12-30 08:08:11] <%GuardianAngelz> @chazisop how is the economy system crucial to the game? I've never used it and I do just fine.
[2022-12-30 08:08:12] <Invierea> Go play a single player game that doesn't require internet. Problem solved. If you don't like an online game, don't buy it.

[2022-12-30 08:17:20] <haahdek> out of curiosity, is unstable internet connection a bad argument?
[2022-12-30 08:17:24] <%kimba274> rings of power is terrible because the acting is the worst in a tv show since 1889. they all have one expression

[2022-12-30 10:22:14] <TK2236> The price is a bit too high for some regions. I could buy a new pc every 5 years for the price of using the highest tier of GFN

[2022-12-30 10:23:21] <%tekmojo> GFN would kill my bandwidth at my resolutions, that's complain, workshop support, how many clicks and time to get into the actual game

[2022-12-30 10:25:39] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @tekmojo for example, when we did the most recent DarksideRP for Atlas. I played the entirety of it from GeForce NOW, but my internet at the time was too slow to download the mods. What you need to do though when launching a steam game from gfn is enable downloads during gameplay, so the mods can download.
[2022-12-30 10:25:40] <$Raikon_Kuzaken> @SamRagga that's just connection stuff, it probably requires a bit higher for bandwidth.
[2022-12-30 10:25:49] <@%+dawneylee> @Aesthir you can play on the phone or tablet but not sure of the controls
[2022-12-30 10:25:49] <+noctis_atriedes> @ElasmoFan Wait, you can use mod though GeForce now, how?
[2022-12-30 10:26:00] <ElasmoFan> mhmm

[2022-12-30 10:26:23] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @tekmojo I meant since my internet was too slow, that's why I used gfn. It downloaded the like 6gb's downloads in a couple minutes.
[2022-12-30 10:26:25] <%tekmojo> yea i heard it's a bit hit or miss
[2022-12-30 10:26:25] <%OragamiSwamy> Do you know if they are using the new AV1 encoding?
[2022-12-30 10:26:26] <+Quiet__Lion> odd question but  are you moving using keyboard? I'm only getting mouse movement on my game

[2022-12-30 10:26:33] <Aesthir> Ok... Still, if this means I can play some turn-based game like XCOM on my phone that would definitely interest me :)
[2022-12-30 10:26:45] <Aesthir> with decent controllability
[2022-12-30 10:27:02] <%$GGuts> I just thought of another use case. In the summer you won't heat up your room if you use GeforceNow to play your games. danHmm

[2022-12-30 10:27:16] <@%xReadyAimMissx> yup, since Atlas runs like a potato. I wanted to keep resources free on my pc and get the mods to download faster. So using GFN was my best option. It worked great and the game ran way better. LUL

[2022-12-30 10:36:53] <Shivalla> Did you hear what Ubisoft did with the Stadia games? They freaking gave all the games you had into Ubisoft connect, and now you can use em on GFN. AND everyone got refunded the games by Google just prior. So to put it simple way, you bought a game. Got your money back, and you still can keep the money. 😁 @burkeblack
[2022-12-30 10:37:10] <%$pwog> why does steam profile have to be public,for gforce now, to play on phone?
[2022-12-30 10:37:23] <Shivalla> and games.
[2022-12-30 10:37:29] <+Darthtrinius> i would love for a 40k game to have a space mechanic the more you travel the more inconsitent is the travel (arriving like 300 hundred years later , or 50 years earlier )

[2022-12-30 10:56:04] <%GuardianAngelz> @BurkeBlack heck with it.. I'm gonna set the Citadel up in a wormhole - and we're claiming that.
[2022-12-30 10:56:11] <+MinhRaJu> lol
[2022-12-30 10:56:15] <EvelKinevel> yes dodge is based on adrenaline you can get a perk that makes it a passive chance to dodge but you cant manually dodge
[2022-12-30 10:56:27] <+Ghostly_Chris> Well, slight catch, you can only play for 1 hour on the free setting, but TOTALLY worth it

[2022-12-30 12:38:29] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @GGuts reminds me of the boss I was watching people kill in one of the new WoW raid I believe. Blizzard had put a christmas hat on the dragon. seqKEK
[2022-12-30 12:38:33] <Arnevoldski> if you go to planetary thing, you can go into each sector and click top right icon
[2022-12-30 12:38:47] <%$GGuts> What happens when a space marine is too old to fight? Will they just keep fighting until they die anyway?
[2022-12-30 12:38:56] <Arnevoldski> then you can see what rewards you get from influence gained doing mission in system
[2022-12-30 12:39:11] <EvelKinevel> need influence for quick fate points gotta figure out the ones that give it and do missions in specific systems
[2022-12-30 12:39:22] <%GuardianAngelz> @BurkeBlack no, people can still sign up for pvp, just individually.
[2022-12-30 12:39:24] <Arnevoldski> there a certain tarot card that help increase influence you can take also
[2022-12-30 12:39:25] <%$GGuts> @GGuts burkeKek
[2022-12-30 12:39:39] <%GuardianAngelz> @BurkeBlack meaning we don't need the logi corp and can gather everyone under the same banner.
[2022-12-30 12:39:39] <RabydPanda> You can do FW individually
[2022-12-30 12:39:49] <Arnevoldski> to improve gained influence point in system mission you receive
[2022-12-30 12:39:54] <$TripleNope> I believe they age slowly, and die before that becomes a problem
[2022-12-30 12:40:15] <%GuardianAngelz> @RabydPanda that's what I*m trying to tell him xD
[2022-12-30 12:40:16] <EvelKinevel> its the weapon
[2022-12-30 12:40:24] VIEWERS: 1 765
[2022-12-30 12:40:33] <EvelKinevel> that is the utility item
[2022-12-30 12:40:34] <dark5pade> @GuardianAngelz did CCP set up the individual fw? i thought that wasn't until later.
[2022-12-30 12:40:47] <$TripleNope> They got a “space marine” class yet?
[2022-12-30 12:40:51] <%GuardianAngelz> @dark5pade yep, you can sign up as a corp or as individual.
[2022-12-30 12:40:58] <EvelKinevel> that is the grenade spot not weapon
[2022-12-30 12:40:59] <Arnevoldski> think buyback stuff disappear when you leave the vendor
[2022-12-30 12:41:13] <EvelKinevel> ^
[2022-12-30 12:41:19] <Arnevoldski> believe you have to buyback before leaving vendor on regret sales
[2022-12-30 12:41:34] <EvelKinevel> you have mines not more constructs
[2022-12-30 12:41:38] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @GuardianAngelz wait, so you can play eve online without doing pvp if you want to? you're not forced into an "always pvp enabled" environment? danHmm

[2022-12-30 12:43:28] <EvelKinevel> the buyback is only there until you leave the store
[2022-12-30 12:43:29] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @dark5pade oh, welp. lol
[2022-12-30 12:43:49] <foxnox9> blessing from the omnisiah

[2022-12-30 12:44:32] <%$GGuts> +1 Burkies point for Ram biberNote
[2022-12-30 12:44:39] <Arnevoldski> when you're in one you should be able to check reward for influence with them doing mission in sector
[2022-12-30 12:44:56] <Arnevoldski> travel
[2022-12-30 12:44:58] <dark5pade> @xReadyAimMissx if you really want to play with pvp turned off, you can always play on the test server. your progress will get reset every time they do a server reset... but you don't have to do pvp there. unless you're in the pvp system.
[2022-12-30 12:45:00] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @GGuts KEKLEO
[2022-12-30 12:45:10] <Arnevoldski> then top right corner should come icon
[2022-12-30 12:45:24] <Arnevoldski> you can check rewards
[2022-12-30 12:45:34] <EvelKinevel> click a system
[2022-12-30 12:46:11] <Arnevoldski> that one you can see progress bar
[2022-12-30 12:46:13] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @dark5pade danHmm hmm I see. I'm only hesitant to try the game, because it takes me an incredibly long time to learn things and if I end up dying a lot. I don't think I will end up learning much. LUL
[2022-12-30 12:46:17] <%+Teclos_Starfang> Goo goo ga ga?
[2022-12-30 12:46:17] <Arnevoldski> what rewards you get
[2022-12-30 12:46:22] <EvelKinevel> influence bar shows rewards for the system
[2022-12-30 12:46:24] <%Game_Ov3r> someone wants to be tickled!!
[2022-12-30 12:46:29] VIEWERS: 1 747
[2022-12-30 12:46:38] <EvelKinevel> you have to do missions in the system to get the rewards
[2022-12-30 12:46:46] <dark5pade> @xReadyAimMissx you can play it for free... so it's not really a problem
[2022-12-30 12:46:57] <Arnevoldski> yah you need fate point to unlock crafting station tech tree
[2022-12-30 12:47:03] <dark5pade> and most people wont mess with you in highsec
[2022-12-30 12:47:07] <Arnevoldski> which unlock more crafting options
[2022-12-30 12:47:08] <%NemisizZ> u get fate on every mission you play, but you get more on the story if i remember right
[2022-12-30 12:47:12] <$Ascate2> hi Burke, how are you today?
[2022-12-30 12:47:15] <EvelKinevel> check otehr systems they ahve different rewards look for Fate rewards

[2022-12-30 12:47:53] <Arnevoldski> well think is personal preference but for me I always try unlock crafting options
[2022-12-30 12:47:57] <%NemisizZ> void missions or whatever they are called

[2022-12-30 12:48:17] <%+Lewy9> @dark5pade In eve you have to learn how to put less value in getting the next big ship if your under threat of pvp because the cheapest ships in the game are cheap enough that any player can get blown up in them 5 times a day
[2022-12-30 12:48:29] VIEWERS: 1 819
[2022-12-30 12:48:31] <Arnevoldski> You check system by click information like you did with current one
[2022-12-30 12:48:31] <%NemisizZ> if u click on a mission, it says how much fate it gives you
[2022-12-30 12:48:41] <Arnevoldski> then when you find system that rewards them
[2022-12-30 12:48:48] <Arnevoldski> you enter it and look for missions
[2022-12-30 12:48:58] <Arnevoldski> yah
[2022-12-30 12:48:58] <$TripleNope> Take you robo army, get into the fantasy universe and kick their butts
[2022-12-30 12:49:07] <Arnevoldski> they're under influence rewards
[2022-12-30 12:49:10] <EvelKinevel> they can be
[2022-12-30 12:49:19] <EvelKinevel> that one has some
[2022-12-30 12:49:23] <Arnevoldski> yah till you get 200 influence
[2022-12-30 12:49:41] <%+Lewy9> its easy enough to avoid getting blown up once you understand the game more
[2022-12-30 12:50:08] <dark5pade> @Lewy9 true... but the full loss pvp is daunting for people who aren't used to it. it does help them to know that most likely, they wont have to face pvp for the first little while.
[2022-12-30 12:50:13] <dark5pade> that'
[2022-12-30 12:50:23] <dark5pade> s not guaraneteed... but for the most part.. it's true

[2022-12-30 12:50:40] <%NemisizZ> u get a fair amount doing void crusades
[2022-12-30 12:50:41] <Arnevoldski> But when you have stuff like tech unlocked, most endgame content usually doing void crusades
[2022-12-30 12:50:53] <%$pwog> wow Crream still streaming?
[2022-12-30 12:51:04] <Arnevoldski> you open at the table with card icon above on the deck of the ship

[2022-12-30 12:53:01] <dark5pade> i never really cared for the theming behind undead. but i like minion master classes
[2022-12-30 12:53:07] <Eastern_Cowboy> I miss the Diablo 2 Necro. it was so fun. Diablo 3 was honestly boring in comparison
[2022-12-30 12:53:16] <Arnevoldski> well scary stuff is the seasonals
[2022-12-30 12:53:26] <Arnevoldski> LUL LUL
[2022-12-30 12:53:32] <@%NoirMagic> hope they use the d2 style summoning not the junk in d3, yeah
[2022-12-30 12:53:32] <+Wil4Punk> yes you summon minions with the necromancer in diablo4, you have 3 types of minions
[2022-12-30 12:53:47] <%+electrigasms> If anyone can take the most beloved class from D2 and ruin it, it's Bilzzard RN
[2022-12-30 12:53:50] <dark5pade> is this single player? or is there a coop mode?
[2022-12-30 12:53:55] <%Oppai_Nani> In diablo 4? there is a necromancer gameplay video and yes you summon skeleton mage, warriors and golems
[2022-12-30 12:53:55] <+Wil4Punk> each type you have to choose one of 3 types of skills
[2022-12-30 12:54:04] <Arnevoldski> at the launch the seasonal some like Nurgle harbringer had so OPed healing at lower levels they had to nerf his heal aura
[2022-12-30 12:54:05] <majorduck3334> hello

[2022-12-30 12:54:51] <xgravitasx> @dark5pade  it's got coop
[2022-12-30 12:55:21] <%Oppai_Nani> @KingOfRedNames But a druide this time thats something! I think ima go with mage or warrior

[2022-12-30 12:55:28] <Arnevoldski> But surprised if you're going into this not having much tech tree stuff unlocked etc.
[2022-12-30 12:55:30] <Eastern_Cowboy> ionno half the time people sell skins and the comments say "P2W" am just like "wut?" lol
[2022-12-30 12:55:42] <+garstige_Giftspinne> diablo 3 real money ah was great
[2022-12-30 12:55:45] <vickter112> It wont be p2w at start then I am sure they will add the shop
[2022-12-30 12:55:48] <Arnevoldski> why the regulars didn't suggest you make a new character for the seasonal stuff
[2022-12-30 12:55:57] <Kekema> i dont mind skins  if no stats on em
[2022-12-30 12:55:57] <+Wil4Punk> in the closed beta barbarian was the worst balanced class, i hope they fix this when open beta comes out
[2022-12-30 12:56:11] <Arnevoldski> you can get lots of cool stuff even early from seasonal chests and crates
[2022-12-30 12:56:19] <dark5pade> people have vastly different definitions of p2w
[2022-12-30 12:56:20] <+Ignizshun> is this game out?
[2022-12-30 12:56:26] <Arnevoldski> also little more challenge with harbringers spawning on missions

[2022-12-30 12:57:30] <+garstige_Giftspinne> don't get fooled of the easy gameplay, he does a level 50 mission at level 62
[2022-12-30 12:57:39] <%SMonTwitch> Darktide is fun but missing features
[2022-12-30 12:57:40] <Arnevoldski> that its fun to play but loot system is horrible, is that true?

[2022-12-30 13:07:09] <remokizz> or add tarrot
[2022-12-30 13:07:34] <remokizz> it should show missions
[2022-12-30 13:07:36] <%NemisizZ> might have to be in the bridge for that
[2022-12-30 13:07:38] <remokizz> but i guess it dont :D
[2022-12-30 13:08:25] <sshen13> one thing d3 does right is the greater rift system, every game should have that, endless gameplay
[2022-12-30 13:08:30] <%kimba274> @wolfman2212 yes, but everything from martyr is playable in prophecy afaik

[2022-12-30 13:10:13] <%kimba274> if you have martyr, all your chars and game are available in prophecy and you only need to have prophecy installed to play everything

[2022-12-30 13:16:01] <%kimba274> nonono

[2022-12-30 13:16:15] <$streamsicle> yes

[2022-12-30 13:16:26] <lendvaimarci> yup
[2022-12-30 13:16:27] <%+Lewy9> he can phase them out maybe
[2022-12-30 13:16:30] <%+JaneInTheBox> jake_wu6410 yeah, I needed a bit  "light hearted" stories after reading the Krieg book

[2022-12-30 13:16:51] <%+JaneInTheBox> and I very much second that - "The Infinite and the Divine" is awesome
[2022-12-30 13:17:00] <kriscrow> they are tools for him, ofc he will end them when they have no more use
[2022-12-30 13:17:15] <+rottencore1> probably keep a couple around as police force but if there is no more war what use do they have

[2022-12-30 13:25:48] <Deiviz> feelings = warp, the emperor cannot afford to have feelings so as not to be corrupted, yet that does not mean that he does have the duty to protect and care

[2022-12-30 13:32:02] <+lockthelootgoblin> If the emperor is so powerful, how did horus whoop up on him so bad

[2022-12-30 13:32:21] <Deiviz> Emperor expected self-sacrifice and duty, not self-preservation from astartes
[2022-12-30 13:32:29] <%+Shoggoth75> i dont think he do not prove nothing for his "creations" but he can sacrifice them for what he think is a "greater good".... much like a "traditional god",,,,
[2022-12-30 13:32:33] <+lockthelootgoblin> Got ya
[2022-12-30 13:32:37] <+Perklon> and he only wounded the god emperor BTW
[2022-12-30 13:32:40] <sshen13> Horus tried to pull an Arthas but this time, dad fights back
[2022-12-30 13:32:44] <%jake_wu6410> We still haven’t got to that part in the Siege of Terra but very close.

[2022-12-30 13:32:47] <+chobtt> @BurkeBlack Horus didn't become a heretic because he thought the emperor looking at them as tools. He became a heretic because Erebus show him a vision showing the Emperor wants to become a God and lied to everyone.
[2022-12-30 13:32:53] <$Goldfish4k14> I'll have what heresy is having

[2022-12-30 13:32:55] <Aesthir> THere was this whole boardgame the Emperor and Malcador played, trying to outsmart a possible Chaos infestation, that was rather interesting
[2022-12-30 13:32:57] <kriscrow> sum glue that was  LUL
[2022-12-30 13:32:58] <%+Lewy9> chaos never works together until the emperor
[2022-12-30 13:33:00] <ogre3000> still the emperor was crushing Horus yet he hesitated to launch the killing blow it's why Horus managed to wound the emperor to begin with
[2022-12-30 13:33:03] <Deiviz> Well, the emperor basically one shotted Horus when he got serious.

[2022-12-30 13:33:24] <Chaser_Yohmoi> after the emprerium took its ultimate form it was to be the emperor, the primarchs and the custodies. primachs where to act as regional reprsentatives for the word of the emperor
[2022-12-30 13:33:26] <+Necrosack> Horus had cocaine, meth, LSD and viagra in him when he fought the Emperor
[2022-12-30 13:34:01] <%SMonTwitch> Human nature
[2022-12-30 13:34:01] <sshen13> That’s a cult
[2022-12-30 13:34:06] <Kekema> where have i seen this in real life
[2022-12-30 13:34:26] <+chobtt> you sound very experienced in the topic Burke. very suspicous monkaHmm
[2022-12-30 13:34:27] <%NemisizZ> thats what thousands sons wanted to do, but when the emperor realized that he stopped them and then rediculed the primarch infront of everyone
[2022-12-30 13:34:32] <pokeypointy> that's a can of worms
[2022-12-30 13:34:34] <sshen13> Heresy!

[2022-12-30 13:35:05] <%kimba274> @JoshuaColossus there is a "warhammer 40k timeline in 20min" on youtube
[2022-12-30 13:35:15] <+MABER_FETT> @BurkeBlack fav class in this game, have you tried the Battle Sister?

[2022-12-30 13:35:47] <sshen13> Burke should do a 40k lore tldr and make it a twitch clip
[2022-12-30 13:35:49] <%SMonTwitch> Yeah, the surface is fun but then you dig into it and there is so much more
[2022-12-30 13:35:50] <$TripleNope> Slap chop
[2022-12-30 13:35:54] <Deiviz> read the "last church" it basically contains the premonition why Heresy happened, the Emperor was warned about it and it probably was a self-fulling profecy
[2022-12-30 13:35:54] <$Goldfish4k14> Kroot are the coolest design in 40k
[2022-12-30 13:35:56] <+chobtt> it's deeper than the Mariana trench
[2022-12-30 13:36:00] <ogre3000> it's been over 10000 years of humanity praying to the emperor imagine how big he is in the Warp yet there seems to be no presence of him in the warp doesn't that seem weird?

[2022-12-30 13:37:17] <sshen13> They don’t need to show everything, first series can be just human vs tyranids or something, leave the other races out
[2022-12-30 13:37:19] <+DDPrime> Emperor bless Henry, cause his task is difficult
[2022-12-30 13:37:27] <%NemisizZ> its expected tbh, as long as the acting is good then im fine with it
[2022-12-30 13:37:27] <%kimba274> you start with an exterminatus. like the DoW 2 retribution final. gives you an instant feel of the universe
[2022-12-30 13:37:33] <%Eumalan> Inquisition story on a Hive World would likely be the easiest to tell
[2022-12-30 13:37:51] <Codebreak3r_> just give us tau cmon man lol
[2022-12-30 13:37:52] <+Necrosack> I think they could do it.  The Space Marine story held up on its own even to newbies.  If they stay tight and focused on one marine (cavil) it can be done.
[2022-12-30 13:37:58] <%NemisizZ> or rogue trader
[2022-12-30 13:37:59] <OneAintZero> did they get the astartes guy in to help with the new show? @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-30 13:38:07] <sshen13> Or just adapt an established video game story

[2022-12-30 13:39:37] <$Goldfish4k14> I hope they make an animated universe too

[2022-12-30 13:41:44] <%+McCrory> @burkeblack the problem with the shows you listed, they had a different production company doing them, boys is Sony, Jack Ryan is paramount. lotr and wheel of time was 100% amazon

[2022-12-30 13:45:59] <evercrow> imagine taking out grimdark out of WH40k for mainstream audience FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-30 13:46:04] <%+Panda_c260> the heresy has to be a moment like the red wedding in 40k, you gotta start in the great crusade for the right feel
[2022-12-30 13:46:10] <+chobtt> Nope
[2022-12-30 13:46:13] <+chobtt> impossible

[2022-12-30 13:46:23] <%+chrisabbott91> Start with Gaunt's Ghosts.
[2022-12-30 13:46:23] <%inquisit0r001> if its a movie they would do it in acts; explain the heresy in the 1st act and go from there
[2022-12-30 13:46:23] <+toodeloot> i am afraid they are going to tone it down, to make it more mainstream
[2022-12-30 13:46:28] <+TripMaverick> I imagine 40k history is long like Dune?

[2022-12-30 13:46:49] <+TripMaverick> Does 40k start off from our earth or diffferent?
[2022-12-30 13:46:49] <+chobtt> first read the books Burke and you'll udnerstand why
[2022-12-30 13:46:50] <%+Thurzy> @Eumalan he has a lto of experience, given what he has done in comics too
[2022-12-30 13:46:50] <%NemisizZ> could be done in flashbacks too
[2022-12-30 13:46:59] <sshen13> I still hope they make a new Warcraft movie… Story sucks but it’s such good cgi eye candy
[2022-12-30 13:47:03] <Deiviz> so what you are saying is that most of the fantasy verses that went mainstream got diluted and dumified, and so that is absolutely  not gonna happen with warhammer?
[2022-12-30 13:47:03] <+Araknon> just came in  to look, whats those bots burke have? i didnt see those when i played the game a long time ago

[2022-12-30 13:49:33] <+MABER_FETT> then like 800 Seasons!!
[2022-12-30 13:49:34] <Deli_Ninja> 52 including filler episodes :)

[2022-12-30 13:49:52] <VrtniPatuljak> I dont think we need the Heresy to start. its a lot of how and why. just start instead
[2022-12-30 13:49:54] <+Necrosack> the horus heresy is already being told on Warhammer TV

[2022-12-30 13:49:55] <Emaharg> 1 huge episode.
[2022-12-30 13:49:56] <+chobtt> Burke there are just too many huge fights in the main story that is not a filler that it wouldn't be possible to fit it into one season

[2022-12-30 13:50:17] <sshen13> Shouldn’t do Horus Heresy as start, need to first establish the emperor
[2022-12-30 13:50:18] <L1ger> "somehow, palpatine returned"
[2022-12-30 13:50:26] <Deli_Ninja> or just do a trilogy movie like star wars :)

[2022-12-30 13:51:34] <%+Panda_c260> I'd say minimum 2 seasons NODDERS for a good telling of heresy, assuming 10 episode seasons NODDERS

[2022-12-30 13:54:45] <+Weaver40k> @chobtt you know a lot of shows have suplimentary books? not everything needs to be in the show because people can read the books for more info

[2022-12-30 13:54:54] <+DrWraithjr> They need to keep it SUPER simple. Dive in to deep to early and everyone will get lost.
[2022-12-30 13:55:01] <Yoomazir> yea
[2022-12-30 13:55:02] <+bobi_sus> nope
[2022-12-30 13:55:02] <ThanosOfTitan> no
[2022-12-30 13:55:06] <VrtniPatuljak> yes, but it would suck
[2022-12-30 13:55:07] <+toodeloot> no
[2022-12-30 13:55:07] <%Blaze_Traile> no
[2022-12-30 13:55:08] <pokeypointy> just make thousands of hours of live action, no problem
[2022-12-30 13:55:09] <Codebreak3r_> follow a fireteam into a planet that discovers the first tyrnid
[2022-12-30 13:55:10] <+JimmyBobbin> thats a massive ask that not everybody wants anyway :p
[2022-12-30 13:55:10] <mauzer2001> no way in hell

[2022-12-30 13:55:14] <Codebreak3r_> would be awesome
[2022-12-30 13:55:15] <%+chrisabbott91> @mob1900 Ciaphas Cain is a Hero of the Imperium of Man.  How dare you blaspheme his great name.
[2022-12-30 13:55:15] <+chobtt> They don1T need the fillers but the improtant stuff yes
[2022-12-30 13:55:15] <Shivalla> If they would go for lore based story, it would take freaking 10+ seasons and halfway they would quit because people would not want to watch filler material every second episode.
[2022-12-30 13:55:23] <+WSeveryn> @burkeblack look at what they did to Wheel of Time.  they killed a e
[2022-12-30 13:55:24] <%Blaze_Traile> Too much things too much
[2022-12-30 13:55:26] <sshen13> They made warcraft in live action, so yes
[2022-12-30 13:55:27] <Emaharg> They could, but it would take years and years to do
[2022-12-30 13:55:30] <mob1900> just hope they dont give it a Blood Origin budget LuL
[2022-12-30 13:55:30] <ZanRebel> i dont see why not, just a lot of CGI needed
[2022-12-30 13:55:31] <+Ghostly_Chris> Just need to let the audience read between the lines, and if they want to learn more about the background, then they can go into the books and video and internet of it
[2022-12-30 13:55:33] <mauzer2001> cgi will be all over it
[2022-12-30 13:55:38] <+WSeveryn> series by making it to short
[2022-12-30 13:55:39] <uno168> probably not, superman gonna get f by those higher-up in gw
[2022-12-30 13:55:41] <@%xReadyAimMissx> If they can do it in Avengers Endgame, they can do it in Warhammer. Kappa
[2022-12-30 13:55:57] <55tactics> @chobtt "important stuff" is subjective
[2022-12-30 13:55:57] <+JimmyBobbin> whats ''important'' is different for each person
[2022-12-30 13:55:57] <%+sel369> Of course they can't, who would be stupid enough to think 40k could be done irl
[2022-12-30 13:55:59] <uno168> look at astartes and where he is now
[2022-12-30 13:56:02] <mob1900> Ci-ci-ci Cipahs Cain, Saviour of the Imperium!
[2022-12-30 13:56:07] <VrtniPatuljak> you could fit 2 humans in power armor
[2022-12-30 13:56:12] <dark5pade> they could just tell the betrayal story you were talking about earlier
[2022-12-30 13:56:13] <+Weaver40k> regular ass viewers dont care about eery characters back story
[2022-12-30 13:56:13] <ZanRebel> why even make it live action, i prefer animated movies anyway, whether it's 3D or 2D
[2022-12-30 13:56:14] <evercrow> no, it can only done with good practical effects or costly animations, and they can't do either Kappa
[2022-12-30 13:56:14] <%Oppai_Nani> Inb4 they cancel it after season 1 just relax and enjoy the show when its out i know y'all excited but keep expectations low lol since you know nothing about it
[2022-12-30 13:56:19] <%Oppai_Nani> burkeKek
[2022-12-30 13:56:26] <Deli_Ninja> the question is. Do they have the Funds to do many many many episodes
[2022-12-30 13:56:27] <ThanosOfTitan> I like arguing Madge
[2022-12-30 13:56:32] <+chobtt> @55tactics That is why it's freaking hard to do it.
[2022-12-30 13:56:34] <%+Thurzy> Poor Ferrus
[2022-12-30 13:56:35] <evercrow> I would love drawn animation like Arcane

[2022-12-30 13:56:40] <+xanthius92> i think it should be a band of brothers style gaunts ghosts series
[2022-12-30 13:56:43] <evercrow> WH40k has some sick art
[2022-12-30 13:56:43] <Codebreak3r_> 40k discussion is argueing lol

[2022-12-30 13:56:54] <%inquisit0r001> yea they can just kill off ferrus manus in a flashback burke NODDERS
[2022-12-30 13:57:00] <+bobi_sus> well if imp guard will be played by Peter Dinklage and space marine by the rock they could fit human into space marine. @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-30 13:57:01] <+toodeloot> space marine is 8ft big
[2022-12-30 13:57:08] <%+stgecu03> imagine an animated opening that shows the back story
[2022-12-30 13:57:22] <55tactics> @chobtt exactly, if you want deep lore, read the books
[2022-12-30 13:57:24] <%+chrisabbott91> @mob1900 And Game of Thrones was a small cast by comparison???
[2022-12-30 13:57:41] <+Aceje> Still has to release as they can still cancel it
[2022-12-30 13:57:42] <Kosa128> you're arguing if it's lore accurate and more than like 1k people won't care about it, if the show is good people will watch it, if it's bad it will die after one season
[2022-12-30 13:57:45] <@%xReadyAimMissx> peepoHappy DED
[2022-12-30 13:57:46] <VrtniPatuljak> idk why were talking about this, its 2y+ out
[2022-12-30 13:57:51] <+chobtt> Listen they are making a show and we don't even know what it will be LUL let's just be happy about it and accept that we have different opinions. But if they are making a Horus Heresy Series then make it good an don't cut any important stuff out of it because that will be the only one what they make.
[2022-12-30 13:57:52] <sshen13> It may not get made. There’s nothing done yet so we don’t know if it’ll fall apart before even starting pre production
[2022-12-30 13:57:53] <%+chrisabbott91> @toodeloot The giants from GoT were bigger than that.
[2022-12-30 13:57:58] <mob1900> i would hope they gave it as much thought as GoT @chrisabbott91
[2022-12-30 13:58:06] <+JimmyBobbin> heres another thought, hear me out, if you're someone who is petrified by the thought of the show being awful... just simply dont watch it SeemsGood
[2022-12-30 13:58:09] <Eastern_Cowboy> no1 watches live action shows for deep lore. give us the good shit and read the books if you want more.
[2022-12-30 13:58:15] <mob1900> GoT kinda grew season by season
[2022-12-30 13:58:18] <%+chrisabbott91> @mob1900 I would as well.  40k deserves at least that much.
[2022-12-30 13:58:24] <mob1900> yeah
[2022-12-30 13:58:34] <Deli_Ninja> how do you make your units stronger?

[2022-12-30 13:59:06] <mob1900> so whoever comes after Cavill's 40k have to match it
[2022-12-30 13:59:19] <%$GGuts> @Eastern_Cowboy It's the characters, the emotion and the audio visuals that need to be on point. The deeper lore is something you read up on later. NODDERS

[2022-12-30 14:03:51] <Spurious_ECG> I hope it is actively cooled, like most similar cosplays nowadays

[2022-12-30 14:04:13] <+Ariqqi> Well that is anti-ewok armor.
[2022-12-30 14:04:13] <ZanRebel> @BurkeBlack easy, only hire buff actors Kappa

[2022-12-30 14:04:16] <evercrow> but can you punch through walls in that, huh?
[2022-12-30 14:04:16] <mob1900> so much chaffing
[2022-12-30 14:04:24] <+HELLFIREV1> Just can't aim fo shit lol
[2022-12-30 14:04:24] <Deli_Ninja> but they can do movie magic and make that storm trooper bigger than what's real
[2022-12-30 14:04:24] <Chaser_Yohmoi> except the helmet is garbage in the trooper armor

[2022-12-30 14:04:52] <djhooker001> @BurkeBlack what was the command for the lore?
[2022-12-30 14:04:52] <sshen13> How big is this guy irl
[2022-12-30 14:04:56] <%Eumalan> also you cant see much at all so if on rough ground would just trip over
[2022-12-30 14:05:01] <+Ariqqi> I think they will have to use football players as space marines and everyone else has to be 5 feet tall.
[2022-12-30 14:05:03] <+Zjyslav> Stormtrooper armor is designed to fit on a regular human being, Space Marines are somewhat bigger.
[2022-12-30 14:05:04] <sshen13> Does his feet touch the ground I wonder
[2022-12-30 14:05:04] <+Aceje> Space marines are way bigger than normal humans
[2022-12-30 14:05:05] <mob1900> he got fans

[2022-12-30 14:05:22] <+DrWraithjr> Just don't put space marines and humans on screen at the same time.
[2022-12-30 14:05:23] <Deli_Ninja> just like the hobbit. they made normal height people look like smol people
[2022-12-30 14:05:26] <VrtniPatuljak> REEEEE

[2022-12-30 14:05:59] <evercrow> karskin armor  is still cool
[2022-12-30 14:05:59] <%$GGuts> That is why they didn't make any 40k stuff, cause you can't make it successful and please da nerds.

[2022-12-30 14:06:21] <evercrow> @sshen13 he probably has some stilts inside of it
[2022-12-30 14:06:22] <Eastern_Cowboy> Rage against the machine? nah, let's all listen to Burke's new podcast "Rage against the ragers"
