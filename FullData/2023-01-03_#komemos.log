[2023-01-03 09:46:34] <%+maeshtar> Getting my eyes lasered was one of the best decisions I ever made. I've done it 19 years ago (I had -7 on both eyes so I could not really see that much without glasses). They overcompensate you so that you once your eyes do start to worsen you will still have normal vision.
