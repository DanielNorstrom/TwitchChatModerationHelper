[2022-12-27 17:22:42] <@%Kuglorf> Most of the time the player spends in the open world of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Locations are filled with all kinds of PvP and PvE-activities, beloved by fans of Stalker: search for artifacts, mutant hunting, exploration of uncharted locations, doing quests and laboratories, participation in faction wars. For those who have little time to play, there are various session modes. pepoG

[2022-12-27 17:54:51] <SindWirLustig> any tips for not dying while progressing the atlas? I always get to red maps without dying but when you have to run them rare and corrupt I always die for the first time.. do I just progress too fast or what

[2022-12-27 18:11:37] <%Ragabosh> @casinocop then no, don't get it, play one of the free arpgs
[2022-12-27 18:11:39] <!HoloGoddess> or make it so you can still hear the steamer during ads
[2022-12-27 18:11:40] <%Nite01> so its basically pointless
[2022-12-27 18:11:48] <%andbeefore> because pay or suffer
[2022-12-27 18:11:50] <!HoloGoddess> like soft ads loud stream

[2022-12-27 18:13:03] <%Nite01> like they send you a notification that you gotta run them, and you have like X minutes to run the ads, or they ll run automaticall
[2022-12-27 18:13:20] <%Nite01> that would be better I think
[2022-12-27 18:13:24] <rixaN_> i think its contractual now right
[2022-12-27 18:13:32] <rixaN_> before it was the wild west people ran no ads some run lots
[2022-12-27 18:13:53] <%Nite01> well, any channel I go to, I get ads in the middle of conversations or content

[2022-12-27 18:15:55] <rixaN_> 3 minutes an hour is so much less pervasive than TV but it feels so much worse
[2022-12-27 18:16:10] <%Nite01> I mean, you enter a channel and you get like 5 ads

[2022-12-27 18:28:28] <+ZaggedoutTV> the way phox does it is clean
[2022-12-27 18:28:32] <%Nite01> and I see nothing unethical about it
[2022-12-27 18:28:36] <@%Nizmat> why wouldn't you embed your own stream on your own website, you can just embed it big and with sound tbh
[2022-12-27 18:28:37] <@%^Nightbot> cuz it's better
[2022-12-27 18:28:39] <%Inharm> feel like ti would be fine if the website was meant for watching the stream specifically, but if its minimized on every page, thats sketch
[2022-12-27 18:28:42] <Naxalite_> twitch even has a guide on how to embed stream on website. why shouldn't it be okay for you too?
[2022-12-27 18:28:55] <%sybernetik_> @ds_lily Quinn used to be 'quinn bot' due to an alleged bot network when he first started streaming to 10K viewers LUL
[2022-12-27 18:29:00] <%sybernetik_> so its probably okay
[2022-12-27 18:29:14] <%Nite01> I mean, its your own content
[2022-12-27 18:29:20] <Naxalite_> oh, now I understand

[2022-12-27 18:29:36] <Arcanlor> well its a little bit bs because ppl have expectations based on viewer count so its almost like a bait. if i see 3k instead of 1.5 i am guessing there is a content window happening for example

[2022-12-27 19:43:59] <%Ragabosh> flat vs % bonuses were also stupid unbalanced
[2022-12-27 19:44:00] <rixaN_> then they nerfed fear in PvE Sadge
[2022-12-27 19:44:00] <%Wizardstrangler> barb still good in group with gear but
[2022-12-27 19:44:04] <%Wizardstrangler> they are far worse baseline now
[2022-12-27 19:44:18] <rixaN_> rangers pretty busted yea
[2022-12-27 19:44:19] <%Wizardstrangler> they were stronger
[2022-12-27 19:44:22] <%Wizardstrangler> because others got weaker
[2022-12-27 19:44:27] <%Wizardstrangler> and they barely adjusted bows
[2022-12-27 19:44:30] <rixaN_> they need to fix the move speed for sure
[2022-12-27 19:44:30] <%Wizardstrangler> except for fighter

[2022-12-27 23:27:40] <+thelegendey> the big damage is the pull back of the tentacles :/
[2022-12-27 23:27:43] <@%Kuglorf> idk maybe im dumb but I wouldn't expect tentacles to do damage when they are dragging back
