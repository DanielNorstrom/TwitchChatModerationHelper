[2022-12-20 19:32:32] <Sepulros> chasing around the atlas was ass
[2022-12-20 19:32:45] <+ImonitOndouble> I think it's one of the only boss fights in PoE that kinda goes against PoE's "ethos" as a "thinking man's ARPG". It kinda requires more mechanical skills than "theory skills". Of course it's not so black and white, but anyways..
[2022-12-20 19:32:56] <ryuukk__> @Andrew756 katarina is kinda nice, and sirus conqueror bosses are also nice mini bosses, but i agree every new stuff is not good imo
[2022-12-20 19:33:04] <%OrsoWobble> Is it that a build doesn't feel complete until it's able to do the uber bosses?
[2022-12-20 19:33:07] <prumpoe> uber atziri needs quite precise positionine
[2022-12-20 19:33:14] <Punishbear> I'd rather have the 4 atlas regions again than fight maven
[2022-12-20 19:33:57] <%OrsoWobble> Is it just that you don't like the Maven fight?
