[2023-01-11 00:27:57] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!

[2023-01-11 00:49:38] <%+ucdchris1> the 3/3 dragon is probably the only passable dragon card besides the 1anathirst

[2023-01-11 00:51:38] <%+ucdchris1> i wonder how weird it would be to pick minion with okani
[2023-01-11 00:51:48] <caybellHS> clumbing is over 55 no?
[2023-01-11 00:51:52] <%+SnowMyzer> My winrate with big spell is 61%. 109-71
[2023-01-11 00:52:04] <+reaperonetho> they only has 3 minions tho
[2023-01-11 00:52:13] <%+ucdchris1> feel like with ur taunt setup, they have to go feldorei band miniumum right
[2023-01-11 00:52:16] <caybellHS> what rank tho
[2023-01-11 00:52:20] <gol1sano> I remember when you would play 1 card per turn and be happy with it. The game has devolved into an abomination and I’m glad we have a moral streamer to guide us back to the light.
[2023-01-11 00:52:26] <caybellHS> i have similar WR with bigspell but usually at the diamon 5+ ranks
[2023-01-11 00:52:27] <%+P3tDuck> my best deck is thief rogue
[2023-01-11 00:52:29] <caybellHS> not too impressibe
[2023-01-11 00:52:37] <just_blade_> @reaperonetho they are going to kill okani before he can counter the minions
[2023-01-11 00:52:40] <%+feduco94> Only Egg will show you the way
[2023-01-11 00:52:44] <%+dragontear03> isnt the best way to play okani on an empty board is quick and without much thought

[2023-01-11 01:17:18] <SavageWolves> Frost DK is the most competitive, but its play patterns are really easy to read

[2023-01-11 01:20:10] <@%littleballofhate> @NoHandsGamer One of the key mistakes you've been making the last few games has been allowing your opponents to play 6/10 worth of stats on turn 2

[2023-01-11 01:22:50] <PaladinIRL> If you could just beat the current broken top deck more often I’d really appreciate it, my viewing experience would be greatly increased if the rogues died more often Kappa thanks 🙏

[2023-01-11 01:24:27] <%OurYoungHero> Hey NoHands, why doesn't Anachronos just put Valeera two turns in the future and give you an immediate win? Would that be op?
[2023-01-11 01:24:48] <lightfreeze_hs> would anachronos be much stronger if it iwas 6 mana?

[2023-01-11 01:25:18] <%+ucdchris1> i think 7 mana is deliberate design cause of the mana thirst, the 7 drop colossal,
[2023-01-11 01:25:26] <ZergVolution> can anachronos get us to the future for a balance patch?
[2023-01-11 01:25:31] <+datfrogger> anachronos is already a strong card
[2023-01-11 01:25:36] <divinegondwm> @ucdchris1 if you don’t have enough mana to respond to their board without loatheb effect, what does it matter?

[2023-01-11 02:52:51] <%$Onyrius> I think getting to D5 does require you to play somewhat regularly. Remember @nohandsgamer that most people don’t have the extra stars from getting legend the previous month.

[2023-01-11 02:54:19] <Mr_Fhtagn> your hs rank isnt bound to quality of enemys you face, we live in mmr times, if you have problems reaching legend just loose 100 times at dia 5 and get chicken ranks to legend as enemy

[2023-01-11 04:58:26] <%+Parabellvm420> wild is for when you really don't feel like playin standard
[2023-01-11 04:58:27] <%Arkarku> play anything (as long as it's not wild or duels or arena KEKW )

[2023-01-11 04:58:35] <ScarecrowCR> do you know the apm needed to shadowstep astalor 3 times???
[2023-01-11 04:58:35] <Hyoob> EU, land of the plebs, will be good for morale
[2023-01-11 04:58:45] <perturbedgertrub> play thijs warrior, it seemed to up against rogue+dh

[2023-01-11 05:00:02] <gonviena> paying for mana is a wild concept
[2023-01-11 05:00:29] <+The_monster_hunter> What are some cards you'd like to see in core this rotation? @NoHandsGamer
[2023-01-11 05:00:36] <+tdeprat001> Asia might be faster queues
[2023-01-11 05:00:51] <Otmershi> It’s new year’s discount for mana season after all
[2023-01-11 05:01:37] <%vayazu2> have you seen the new avatar or are you into that stuff
[2023-01-11 05:01:58] VIEWERS: 754
[2023-01-11 05:02:05] <%+Parabellvm420> is a spell/effect always better "on a stick"?
[2023-01-11 05:02:09] <tiny_littleone> I need to call it a night. I have you have a good remainder of your stream and games start to look good
[2023-01-11 05:02:12] <ScarecrowCR> that warlock is playing a strange secret card...
[2023-01-11 05:02:35] <%rexmkh> metabreaker warlock Kappa
[2023-01-11 05:02:36] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> new deck Pog Kappa
[2023-01-11 05:02:51] <%+SnowMyzer> God is there anyone playing this game that isn’t playing rogue
[2023-01-11 05:02:58] <Hyoob> I thought he was playing secret warlock for a second
[2023-01-11 05:02:59] <quaq13> there is no warlock =(
[2023-01-11 05:03:11] <%+SnowMyzer> Actually so frustrating thoughts?
[2023-01-11 05:03:12] <ScarecrowCR> warlock is only in your imagination
[2023-01-11 05:03:22] <%rexmkh> how do we even know no hands isn't a rogue? Kappa
[2023-01-11 05:03:57] <ScarecrowCR> you should play more minions and spend your mana KEKW

[2023-01-11 05:05:23] <corey123014> Isn’t it a terrible thing for standard for one class to be so dominant? It even becomes boring to watch bc it’s so repetitive
[2023-01-11 05:05:43] <+The_monster_hunter> not enough armor for them LUL
[2023-01-11 05:05:54] <%nerazzurri_> take a short break maybe, clear your mind
[2023-01-11 05:05:57] <casie1> eu too hard

[2023-01-11 05:06:01] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> the devs determined that only the rogue class is allowed to have fun
[2023-01-11 05:06:01] <ZBD502> the meta that finally broke nohands
[2023-01-11 05:06:05] <%+Parabellvm420> its all good bro

[2023-01-11 05:08:08] <Profoundlove> did you see the psycho priest list the CN player was top 50 on NA with?
[2023-01-11 05:08:11] <caybellHS> do you know what the dragon ball story is loosely based on?
[2023-01-11 05:08:23] <ScarecrowCR> doesn't hunter beat rogue most of the time?

[2023-01-11 05:08:50] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> not being able to target a single class with anything is the worst feeling
[2023-01-11 05:09:24] <Profoundlove> it might make you feel a little better about the rogues if you're interested i can dm you

[2023-01-11 05:10:03] <%+Xeath5> wdym rogue is high skill testing. you just randomly generate destroy random enemy minion and step astalor nohandsKappa
[2023-01-11 05:10:31] <+The_monster_hunter> 10 hp already, oof
[2023-01-11 05:11:05] <caybellHS> seeing an old clip of nohands with no beard is like that scene in spongebob movie when king neptune reveals his bald head
[2023-01-11 05:11:11] <%+Xeath5> i played 1 ranked game in eu in 10 days ResidentSleeper just better to wait for changes ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-11 05:11:21] <+The_monster_hunter> going planted for armor mightve been the correct play there
[2023-01-11 05:11:23] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> feels like every streamer except jalex is miserable in this meta LUL
[2023-01-11 05:11:45] <%+GuildChatter> ty for the stream
