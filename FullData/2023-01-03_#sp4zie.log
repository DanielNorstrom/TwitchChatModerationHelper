[2023-01-03 10:26:15] VIEWERS: 684
[2023-01-03 10:26:36] <AlbertBrostein> Because grabbing the orb means you pick one of that champ out of the pool
[2023-01-03 10:26:45] <AlbertBrostein> So your chance of finding another one will be lowered

[2023-01-03 12:19:33] <kurrekurban> it says so in the text
[2023-01-03 12:19:33] <ManOfShambles> slam the hurricane
[2023-01-03 12:19:36] <%+Xaytah> it just says so on the augment
[2023-01-03 12:19:37] <thereon> because it reads so "When you field exactly 2 copies of a non-threat champion, they both gain 45% Attack Damage and 45 Ability Power, Armor, and Magic Resist. When you 3-star, gain a 2-star copy."
[2023-01-03 12:19:38] <kurrekurban> probably would be too good
[2023-01-03 12:19:43] <achraftha> cuz they be too op i think
[2023-01-03 12:19:49] <beepbeep_im_a_sheep> cho is most of the time in the right or left corner spuz, he will hit his beam onto everyone
[2023-01-03 12:20:11] <XZAERT> dt and built diff doesnt work on threats because it would be op
[2023-01-03 12:20:36] <%wronggparty> probably cause those units are already buffed up, and they dont have traits that need to be active. So it would probably just be too strong
[2023-01-03 12:20:37] <%+Xaytah> Runaans interacts really well with Bel imo

[2023-01-03 12:28:05] <Gopeto21> @Flaming_Banone I think its rng but the more champions you hit the better

[2023-01-03 12:28:23] <%Dher0> sp4zieHeya
[2023-01-03 12:28:24] <$Flaming_Banone> so it's a fixed chance *per champion hit*?
[2023-01-03 12:28:34] <%+Xaytah> Basically, the % chance rolls for every unit hit.
[2023-01-03 12:28:39] <$Flaming_Banone> holy jesus
