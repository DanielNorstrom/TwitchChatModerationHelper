[2022-12-31 08:17:44] <+Senor_Sultana> there are so many merely streamers.
[2022-12-31 08:19:00] <+Senor_Sultana> creative criticism. definitely understand.

[2022-12-31 08:20:01] <+hevakhevak> I'm having a hard time leveling a decent gun quickly in WZ, It would be nice to have a shortcut youtube video on getting to a viable gun quickly.
[2022-12-31 08:20:29] <+hevakhevak> especially because you have to level random guns to get attachments
[2022-12-31 08:20:39] <+AJflick42> I moved on from my 6900xt, it was a great card and I sold it to a gaming buddy for $500 usd, which is a win.

[2022-12-31 08:21:40] <+Senor_Sultana> easy tiktok how to level gun = contracts.
[2022-12-31 08:21:47] <%+cyrillic_404> @AJflick42 Which card did you picked, 7900 xtx?
[2022-12-31 08:22:21] <+NineShotNigel> Last stream? been away awhile
[2022-12-31 08:22:43] <+AJflick42> @cyrillic_404 no, I went back to Nvidia, 4090. I just wanted the upgrade gpu to be over for a few years.
[2022-12-31 08:22:51] <+hevakhevak> I just dont know which attachments to go for, so i'd have to level random guns.
[2022-12-31 08:22:55] <+Senor_Sultana> man friends are great shift work makes hanging out with them difficult.
[2022-12-31 08:23:14] <+hevakhevak> Amazon did tests and red for prices had the highest sales

[2022-12-31 08:23:30] <+Senor_Sultana> 50% = blue
[2022-12-31 08:23:55] <%+dereul3r> good morning
[2022-12-31 08:24:10] <+brooksie359> @AJflick42 make sure your gpu power connecter is in all the way. dont want to start your computer on fire lol.
[2022-12-31 08:24:21] <+Senor_Sultana> shining 50%
[2022-12-31 08:24:33] <+AJflick42> @brooksie359 can confirm all is well with the connector.
[2022-12-31 08:25:00] <+hevakhevak> Should be Damage + 50%
[2022-12-31 08:25:14] <+Senor_Sultana> maybe " Damage + 50%"
[2022-12-31 08:25:15] VIEWERS: 84
[2022-12-31 08:25:16] <+hevakhevak> I don't think Damage needs +
[2022-12-31 08:25:23] <+AJflick42> Damage + 50%
[2022-12-31 08:25:39] <!%armandharmes> isn't it Damage +50 % ?
[2022-12-31 08:26:14] <+brooksie359> yeah as long as you are careful there should be no issue with the connector but the fact that if you have it not fully connected it can start a fire is still scary to me. definitely would be extra careful its in all the way.
[2022-12-31 08:26:30] <MarcusDante> still green
[2022-12-31 08:26:34] <+hevakhevak> green
[2022-12-31 08:26:39] <+Senor_Sultana> would have to see it my mind palace is sleepy.
[2022-12-31 08:26:45] <!%armandharmes> what about gold color

[2022-12-31 08:27:37] <+hevakhevak> Looks like a medical sign
[2022-12-31 08:27:38] <%+cyrillic_404> I think that +50% needs to be green, like a positive
[2022-12-31 08:27:59] <!%armandharmes> ok I follw
[2022-12-31 08:28:43] <+hevakhevak> Is there a skinnier +?

[2022-12-31 08:54:59] <@^StreamElements>* Mass-subgifting is random. Asking for a sub gift will result in a timeout. Keep doing it and you will be banned. Begging for gifts is rude so don't do it. Thanks.

[2022-12-31 09:12:07] <%+TactfulRager> To resolve this, you can switch to default controls in the event that an update is rolled out and smart controls are not working as expected.

[2022-12-31 09:15:39] <%+TactfulRager> There is also a "Shooting mode" which is available, and needs to be manually enabled and disabled with F1 if you are not using smart controls. This would allow you to use the mouse as you might on a PC game.

[2022-12-31 11:09:00] <+Freezer_Roebuck> don't know why people have such an issue with the lgbqt community I'm Hetro and one of best nights out I've had was in a gay bar
[2022-12-31 11:09:05] <+Andy_Summerfield> It's EXACTLY the same as saying that you don't feel "Safe" around a Catholic , Christian , Jew , Muslin or any other denomination
[2022-12-31 11:09:13] <%KayleighDHB> The point is, just because you are playing a game, doesn’t make you homophobic or racist etx
[2022-12-31 11:09:14] <@^StreamElements> @KayleighDHB, P4wnyhof is not gay but generally very happy!
[2022-12-31 11:09:20] <fenekOfficial> i'd feel unsafe in a room with a serial killer
[2022-12-31 11:09:35] <%KayleighDHB> @streamelements LUL LUL
[2022-12-31 11:09:44] <+Freezer_Roebuck> oh you on about JK my bad I popped in mid convo haha
[2022-12-31 11:09:47] <+Atrionix> I have a gay (well, she's pansexual) friend. I once went clubbing with her in a gay club. I wasn't worried for a fucking second. In fact, I made it clear that I wasn't interested in people of the same sex and that was that. Had a fucking good time. Another example: my best friend is religious. I am not. We have plenty of talks about his beliefs and he feels very strongly about them yet he never forces them on me. Problem solved lol
[2022-12-31 11:09:49] <%+CptFusselBoeseWicht> i had the same conversation with a vegan guy wo was insulting me because i like to eat meat and vegetables and stuff and im not just eating meat every day. meat for me needs to be something special and i only buy what i need and not mass buying meat ^^ I have a lot of friends that supports also LGBTQ and stuff and he said as a big fan of harry potter he would still love to play the game
[2022-12-31 11:09:49] VIEWERS: 323
[2022-12-31 11:10:18] <Torena_> That take is really just hating on the art because a creator is doo doo in their head. This happens so often
[2022-12-31 11:10:52] <+Atrionix> The problem is that people force their beliefs on other people. People should live and let other people live and do their own thing
[2022-12-31 11:11:24] <%+FrenkiiYFN> I've never knew about Rolling and the LGBT stuff .... and I now a bad person when I play the game???
[2022-12-31 11:11:36] <Konuwatchmia> I go to work with 30 other people, go to shoping malls.... I have never felt unsafe around any of them. I dont even know them nor do I care to be there friends. I dont understand this hurt behavior being in a room with other people. It seems very childish.

[2022-12-31 11:12:37] <+Atrionix> well, to be fair, the real world is a shit show Kappa
[2022-12-31 11:13:02] <Torena_> I think using the phrase "real world" is very wrong here P4wny, since also the content creator world is part of the real world. What you probably mean is a usual 9-5 job kinda deal right?
[2022-12-31 11:13:10] <+Atrionix> if people want to be inclusive, they should not exclude people with their own mindsets
[2022-12-31 11:13:13] <%trippylf> we want to include everyone, except that guy over there
[2022-12-31 11:13:14] <+Atrionix> hypocrits
[2022-12-31 11:13:27] <%butterbrot7c> Guilt by association, bad practice by lots of people
[2022-12-31 11:13:30] <%lidofrin> it seems similar to the discussion about Narnia and christianity...at least it sounds pretty similar. Of course you can like Narnia but have a problem with christianity. And I would never charge anyone being a crusader just by liking Narnia

[2022-12-31 11:14:29] <Torena_> Oh snap, I guess I really underestimated this. Since I am a non content creator. xd
[2022-12-31 11:14:39] <%+CptFusselBoeseWicht> over reacting bullshit in my opinion if you like something over decades why stop just because every one is getting upset just play what you like. I dont like Fortnite but dont say hes a bad person for playing fortnite just let them life and do what they want ^^
[2022-12-31 11:15:14] <+Atrionix> i mean.. asmongold is a brilliant example
[2022-12-31 11:15:35] <Torena_> I am also not able to clean my own shit I am just not a content creator (and I am also not mentally too well).

[2022-12-31 11:18:21] <Torena_> I see where you are comming from but that dosnt have to do (mostly) with having mental problems or just being at home all the time. I was unemployeed for the past 6 years and just spend time at home on my PC, if you are slightly aware of yourself you can see the drift and do something against it. Those people are just not selfaware for one reason or another.
[2022-12-31 11:18:52] <%lidofrin> step out to keep up with reality. I always face that problem on twitter-maniacs. They are totally off when recognizing the "world outside" doesn't even know the topic ur talking about ... u thought until then it is the most important for humanity ^^
