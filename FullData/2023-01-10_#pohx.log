[2023-01-10 19:57:34] <+Solomon_Kain> I like the fighting multiple bosses much more than fighting Maven.
[2023-01-10 19:57:42] <+Blade420> @dat_pudding sounds a bit more like it
[2023-01-10 19:57:46] <+EverangeR> been playing flicker strike and over the seizures. Starting your rf jugg guide now :)
[2023-01-10 19:57:47] <Maxwell_Audier> My lifetap addiction on low recovery builds does not help

[2023-01-10 19:58:05] <%+ArcticIceFox> @Maxwell_Audier but jugg rf can face tank all the other mechanics tho. Helped me beat maven for the very first time since she came out lol
[2023-01-10 19:58:57] <Maxwell_Audier> Only time i ever fought her and one it was on a 50+ divine build
[2023-01-10 19:59:02] <Maxwell_Audier> Won*
[2023-01-10 19:59:05] <draculaaocontrario> you can put all them togheter?
[2023-01-10 19:59:08] <Maxwell_Audier> Its just a skill issue
[2023-01-10 19:59:18] <%Zerograviti> Wait, you can do that?? using 3 einhar scarabs at the same time?

[2023-01-10 20:03:33] <old__Joe> but why you need so much essenses??
[2023-01-10 20:03:41] <%+inSpired_TV> @Cowpanda i use ", fire|fire," - not sure if there's any gems with only a fire tag (would miss that) but otherwise works
[2023-01-10 20:03:48] <adolebitque> I have 23 writhing invitations but no will to run them

[2023-01-10 20:04:20] <%+Pallchek> @Cowpanda he wants to buy, so i guess he meant on the trade website. I don't think there is a way on the website
[2023-01-10 20:04:20] <Ninjakens> essencess is the only method to crat at leas 1 affix determenisticlally
[2023-01-10 20:04:27] <%+Cowpanda> Essences is amazing
[2023-01-10 20:04:28] <Venoxis_> essences are scary
[2023-01-10 20:04:30] <Ninjakens> also it's good exp
[2023-01-10 20:04:56] <%Zerograviti> @pohx I enjoy finding essences, fighting them not so much
[2023-01-10 20:05:03] <Oct0_Pus> essences are amazing muns in sc trade
[2023-01-10 20:05:10] <GamGam_chan> How have essences felt this league? Im worried about them being rippy but that might be old archnem fears
[2023-01-10 20:05:18] <+antonhavree> Same, even better when you open them with a bunch of mobs around, chain reaction and poof, they are suddenly gone
[2023-01-10 20:05:20] <%Zerograviti> @pohx especially if they have fire and ignite resistance as a mod

[2023-01-10 20:08:53] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @McCreeper97 are you running regular maps for blight or blighted maps
[2023-01-10 20:09:02] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @ArcticIceFox 12 is not many at all

[2023-01-10 20:09:48] <iammelard> New to PoE and I've seen that mostly PoE Players recommend your build and here I am. Thank you for welcoming me :)

[2023-01-10 20:09:54] <%+ArcticIceFox> @dyzzy_bz ah ok, just curious. It's like 1.2 divines worth, just wasn't sure the average
[2023-01-10 20:10:08] <%+jeeze9> i didnt know you were gonna craft more on the current weap

[2023-01-10 20:10:19] <dyzzy_bz> @ArcticIceFox it was way more than 1.2 divs when i did it at league start
[2023-01-10 20:10:23] <%Zerograviti> @pohx I always do the recipe on opal bases, I find the void scepter ugly
[2023-01-10 20:10:23] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @iammelard the build and guide is incredible! check out pohx.net and the faq/crafts section its super helpful

[2023-01-10 20:10:44] <xlusionn> Easiest way to get fire gems with qual?
[2023-01-10 20:10:48] <xlusionn> or qual on fire gems?
[2023-01-10 20:10:50] <dyzzy_bz> @ArcticIceFox remember than u can still run a normal elder helm without the elemental dmg till u get the one u need
[2023-01-10 20:10:51] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @dyzzy_bz the helmets are super saturated. you will save a ton by buying them now
[2023-01-10 20:11:26] <dyzzy_bz> why buy them now, i quit the league today nothing left for me to do
[2023-01-10 20:11:30] <%+ArcticIceFox> @dyzzy_bz yeah I'm wearing one rn, just crafting one better to replace it. It also has malevolence enchant so I can fit in skitterbots

[2023-01-10 20:11:43] <%+Pallchek> @xlusionn you can set your filter to show fire gems with lower quality on maps, there is a section on filterblade for it
[2023-01-10 20:11:51] <dyzzy_bz> i'm tagged tho
[2023-01-10 20:11:58] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @dyzzy_bz yep thats how threads work sorry
[2023-01-10 20:12:12] <dyzzy_bz> Sadge
[2023-01-10 20:12:19] <xlusionn> @Pallchek Yeah but allmost no gems drops
[2023-01-10 20:12:54] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @ArcticIceFox if youre going for improving your gear through crafting, on nice RF gear, prepare to have like 10 divs in craft budget. its starting to get to be late league.
[2023-01-10 20:12:54] <%+Pallchek> @xlusionn if you run t14+ wiht influence and expeditions on maps, always check for additional gem drops
[2023-01-10 20:12:58] <%+ArcticIceFox> @dyzzy_bz that's the one I'm wearing, bought fresh from the market. But could use a better one for min-max.
[2023-01-10 20:13:00] <Ninjakens> i would get a 2ond helmet so you can have one to use temporeraly till you get a solid roll
[2023-01-10 20:13:04] <+EverangeR> Clicked on your stream in recommended channels today. Little did I know i'd find myself re-rolling. Thanks for the detailed guide!
[2023-01-10 20:13:26] <xlusionn> @Pallchek Right now i run with a weapon on my second hand slot with 6 sockets so i have fire gems in lvl them to lvl 20 and use 1 gcp to each so i get them qual 20
[2023-01-10 20:13:31] <%+Pallchek> @xlusionn for me, expedition dropped a ton of gems on some maps, just need to pick the gem reward early in the explosions

[2023-01-10 20:13:57] <+antonhavree> "once you go RF you never go back" Or something like that. Can't remember the actual quote
[2023-01-10 20:14:02] <xlusionn> @Pallchek but thanks alot for the tips :D
[2023-01-10 20:14:38] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @GoGoLoThirty yep, crafting isnt easy despite what crafting vets will make it seem like lol. once you understand the tools and tricks you can figure stuff out but the issue is that you dont exactly get like highlighted tutorials like "now you could try this with this item" in the game
[2023-01-10 20:14:54] <%+brizeno1> passive points

[2023-01-10 20:17:39] <@%GoGoLoThirty> I mean its a perk to the build style. people completely avoid miners because of the way you have to use your keybinds and stuff. ppl just associate it with lazy cause thats natural to do
[2023-01-10 20:17:40] <%+gibble1> okay cool, thanks!

[2023-01-10 21:26:30] <Oct0_Pus> your best course of action is scour suff multimod the dot and fire mult and slam i guess
[2023-01-10 21:26:31] <+StoweMobile> Can get divines reliably from league mechanic, but ya that's super expensive
[2023-01-10 21:26:34] <PISKONAVT> I would lock prefix and reroll in Harvest

[2023-01-10 21:26:57] <StickOfButter7> If you get no suffix then you can aug +1 fire
[2023-01-10 21:27:02] <MasterBrico> u have an eldrich anul?
[2023-01-10 21:27:08] <%Strollein> btw with a rune dagger you can guarantee +1 fire
[2023-01-10 21:27:24] <StickOfButter7> Not if you mult mod and prefix cant be changed
[2023-01-10 21:27:30] <Oct0_Pus> he can aug +1 fire but its a 1 in 7
[2023-01-10 21:27:43] <Swageroni_> or u can scour, 3mods, cannot roll attack ,cant change prefix and u get +1 fire with 3 clean prefixes
[2023-01-10 21:27:47] <+x__vindictive> all's well that ends well :)
[2023-01-10 21:27:49] <Swageroni_> lots of currency sink but..
