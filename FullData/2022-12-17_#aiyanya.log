[2022-12-17 12:01:31] <%+RisellSnowcrest> @RisellSnowcrest oh god yes we hit it earlier ish too and no one had any real idea how it was solved outside of the world prog teams
[2022-12-17 12:01:33] <%+RisellSnowcrest> it was nasty
[2022-12-17 12:02:05] <%jallyman55> oh Aiya that p8 group with the youtube description says he's streaming on youtube
[2022-12-17 12:02:07] <%+RisellSnowcrest> I'm expecting 6.3 to be slightly easier than DSR as i think it will be a puzzle ultimate vs a execution ulti
[2022-12-17 12:02:23] <@InfiniteYeet> I have a bad feeling it may be a puzzle ultimate
[2022-12-17 12:02:24] <%+RisellSnowcrest> so the blind prog will be hard but after that will be slightly easier

[2022-12-17 12:05:58] <@InfiniteYeet> I think the way DSR went around it makes it harder for a longer period of time so it has the best longevity out of any ultimate to date so I am wondering if the feed back about it being hard but less fun will make them change pace to TEA style where the difficulty is in very high consistency precise mechanics and then a big puzzle at the end
