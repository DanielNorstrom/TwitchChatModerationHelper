[2023-01-03 01:40:31] <!%BenjyyX> How do you know about my demon cow lover but you don't know the furry porn yelnax
[2023-01-03 01:40:33] <%Christmas_Fighters> Sevaagoth_ for most of my days i used to watch twitch on chromecast lol
[2023-01-03 01:40:41] <%Christmas_Fighters> so no chat
[2023-01-03 01:40:46] <%Christmas_Fighters> it was just a background
[2023-01-03 01:41:01] <%Christmas_Fighters> i follow sing since uhm
[2023-01-03 01:41:09] <%Christmas_Fighters> a lot time i guess
[2023-01-03 01:41:30] <%Christmas_Fighters> BenjyyX, you told me about the demon cow last year WTFF
[2023-01-03 01:41:32] <!%BenjyyX> I follow since like 2016 when i discovered twitch
[2023-01-03 01:41:36] <!%BenjyyX> Or 2015
[2023-01-03 01:41:39] <!%yelnaX> when sing deleted the vods the 2nd time, emin asked to tell people that they were still online Christmas_Fighters
[2023-01-03 01:41:42] <!%BenjyyX> Oh yea, i forgot KEK
[2023-01-03 01:41:52] <!%yelnaX> so I was online at the time and would be telling people where to find them
[2023-01-03 01:41:59] <%Christmas_Fighters> KEK
[2023-01-03 01:42:08] <!%BenjyyX> Plus, yelnax is a furry porn enjoyer
[2023-01-03 01:42:08] <!%yelnaX> then I think Melpomenecatharsis made a copy pasta about me telling peoiple
[2023-01-03 01:42:30] <!%yelnaX> and added that I was a furry porn connosieur because I used a VR set
[2023-01-03 01:42:40] <!%yelnaX> and thus a lore was born
[2023-01-03 01:42:43] <!%BenjyyX> Aaaand... because you do enjoy furry porn
[2023-01-03 01:42:56] <!%yelnaX> I don't think I would hate it
[2023-01-03 01:43:01] <!%yelnaX> but I haven't watched it

[2023-01-03 05:09:26] <%darkbiacksnow> Shootles in hard mode, one of her basic attacks dispel phoenix so you can die randomly
[2023-01-03 05:09:34] <%Shootles> you need mug
[2023-01-03 05:09:40] <%Shootles> and mug her from the start
[2023-01-03 05:09:43] <%Shootles> then you get max pheonix downs
[2023-01-03 05:09:46] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah, but one of her attacks can dispel phoenix
[2023-01-03 05:09:47] <%Shootles> so you just put another one one
[2023-01-03 05:09:49] <%darkbiacksnow> and get 1shotted

[2023-01-03 05:13:02] <%Shootles> that shit is only for that stupid pot
[2023-01-03 05:13:05] <%darkbiacksnow> no, from dying
[2023-01-03 05:13:19] <%Homeless_Emperor> nah i used costly punch + high jump
[2023-01-03 05:13:21] <%darkbiacksnow> because 75m hp is no joke when you're only dealing 99k
[2023-01-03 05:13:37] <%darkbiacksnow> his ability one shots in hard right?
[2023-01-03 05:13:38] <%Shootles> i guess that's cheaper AP
[2023-01-03 05:13:39] <%darkbiacksnow> her*
[2023-01-03 05:13:42] <%Homeless_Emperor> gil toss has higher dps

[2023-01-03 05:13:53] <%darkbiacksnow> gil toss is 5 or 6 hits of 99k
[2023-01-03 05:14:02] <%darkbiacksnow> so its faster okey
[2023-01-03 05:14:05] <%darkbiacksnow> but you farm gil instead LULE
[2023-01-03 05:14:06] <%Shootles> Hmm
[2023-01-03 05:14:30] <%Homeless_Emperor> better to fight minerva for 8 hours than farm gil for 8 hours

[2023-01-03 05:29:32] <%darkbiacksnow> I was able to get it in my 3rd or 4th try I think
[2023-01-03 05:29:54] <%Shootles> is it meant to be on 0?!
[2023-01-03 05:30:00] <%+o1nk3rs_> singsingRee
[2023-01-03 05:30:04] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah I think so
[2023-01-03 05:30:06] <%Shootles> or push on what would be 0 with his shitty delay push
[2023-01-03 05:30:07] <%darkbiacksnow> thats what I count on
[2023-01-03 05:30:27] <%Shootles> fuck it, i have the trophy already

[2023-01-03 05:31:17] <!%Yolovsky> nothing beats ff7r pull ups minigame okey
[2023-01-03 05:31:17] <%darkbiacksnow> I think I was frustrated a bit for that
[2023-01-03 05:31:18] <%darkbiacksnow> but good thing I got lucky
[2023-01-03 05:31:33] <%darkbiacksnow> thank god the crisis core squats are easy
[2023-01-03 05:31:39] <%Shootles> if i didn't sync up with a YT vid i think i'd still be there
[2023-01-03 05:31:43] <%darkbiacksnow> compared to ff7r pull ups
[2023-01-03 05:31:46] <%Shootles> the squats are easy
[2023-01-03 05:31:48] <%Homeless_Emperor> they should have made squats like ff7r
[2023-01-03 05:31:51] <%Homeless_Emperor> smhmyhead
[2023-01-03 05:31:51] <%Shootles> Stare
[2023-01-03 05:31:56] <%darkbiacksnow> no fuck you
[2023-01-03 05:31:56] <%Shootles> those ff7 ones are SO hard
[2023-01-03 05:32:04] <%Shootles> the squats are EASY
[2023-01-03 05:32:05] <!%Yolovsky> ff7r pull ups is difficult because I was distracted by something
[2023-01-03 05:32:06] <%darkbiacksnow> that minigame in ff7r needs full concentration
[2023-01-03 05:32:10] <%Shootles> it's the first transition that sucked
[2023-01-03 05:32:12] <%darkbiacksnow> BOOBA

[2023-01-03 05:44:20] <%Shootles> i assume the he's probably a massive drug addict at this point
[2023-01-03 05:44:24] <%darkbiacksnow> FF7R had good english VAs
[2023-01-03 05:44:37] <%Shootles> i will die on the hill that the aerith english actress is awesome

[2023-01-03 13:07:46] <@%$Anuviel7> docking  A very intimate and intense sexual act performed by two uncircumcised men. Guy one pulls his foreskin back and holds it while guy two stretches his open and outward as far as possible over the head and shaft of guy one's penis. Then guy one repeats the procedure as he's releasing all of his foreskin that he was holding back tightly, pulling the opening out and as far down as possible over guy two's penis, making sure guy two's foreskin stays in place.

And since they have very little girth, that just makes them these absolutely giant fucking dinner plates that God must have accidentally dropped while washing dishes one day and shrugged his shoulders at because no one could have imagined this would happen. AND WITH NO PURPOSE. EVERY POUND OF THAT IS A WASTED POUND AND EVERY FOOT OF IT (10 FT BY 14 FT) IS WASTED SPACE.
