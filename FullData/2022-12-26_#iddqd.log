[2022-12-26 11:48:45] <%Goryllo> that's true @iddqd but i would say that tank, specially how they were in OW 1 should never be able to one shot you. and i stand by it in OW 2 still

[2022-12-26 11:49:40] <Scamahh> they think never nerfing support heros will make support popular but that isnt the issue
[2022-12-26 11:49:41] <%+NyoXandrian> How much extra damage is mercy boost again?
[2022-12-26 11:49:50] <%Smacky20> ppMercy Not my fault

[2022-12-26 11:50:16] <VikingJackAU> NOPERS Can't touch supports
[2022-12-26 11:50:27] <ClaymoreLdr> Your argument just is, nerf supports. So no. If there are good supports who enable dps, why not nerf the dps. Its ok

[2022-12-26 11:51:29] <blobgiraffe> @ClaymoreLdr if they nerf the dps then the dps is unable to play without that support enabling them meaning the support becomes even more overpowered

[2022-12-26 11:51:58] <Reignus> Hog is still badly designed apart from Kiriko tho. Tanks shouldn't be able to oneshot (regardless of how broken/strong he is)
[2022-12-26 11:52:05] <quasiverbal> if blizzard ever decided to actually nerf supports we wouldn't have needed the game to be 5v5

[2022-12-26 11:53:03] <Scamahh> I feel nerfs should be balanced between ashe and mercy and hog and kiriko etc instead of just picking one to nerf entirely out of viability.
[2022-12-26 11:53:06] <%finsterFPS> @wackytaco692 isnt your sub badge just the 1st? since youre a founder sub

[2022-12-26 14:30:40] <DecadeUK> i agree
[2022-12-26 14:30:43] <%+sliime69420> i used to play cod on on console

[2022-12-26 14:31:09] <DecadeUK> something like splatoon would be a nightmare on M&KB
[2022-12-26 14:31:10] <+Excruciation> pc talent cap is higher because they can instantly target you and track you from skill and playtime
[2022-12-26 14:31:12] <+aj7continue> i roll pc players on controller
[2022-12-26 14:31:18] <%+sliime69420> i liked that tangent

[2022-12-26 14:33:43] <+Excruciation> its not a bash on consoles at all, they are doing amazing things with an anolog controller while a mouse is like using telekenisis in comparison lol

[2022-12-26 14:34:31] <Fair_Squared> the aim assist is pretty big. I had to turn mine down to 40% strength or I would have my aim ripped off people when I was playing tracer

[2022-12-26 14:44:52] <Oneminuterice> as a console player - alot of the players genuienly just prefer to to shoot big target even if they have double pocket and expect them to  die

[2022-12-26 14:52:27] <%Qnote> @iddqd you say dash out so maybe it gets a kill on whatever support I’m diving, I typically use dash to secure the kill (dashing the ground) then once I kill I get out
