[2023-01-07 00:00:06] <%Sims112> well if its the same size and has the same cables it's easy right?
[2023-01-07 00:00:16] <%Houdini111> Eh.... It's a pain in the butt. You have to unplug everything and then plug them back in... and then cable manage. Not neccessarily hard (though the main MB power connector could be a royal pain to disconnect) just really tedious.
[2023-01-07 00:00:39] <%Houdini111> @Sims112 Do NOT risk using the same connectors. cirNOPERS
[2023-01-07 00:00:55] <%nazzurro> whar Cirno? Whar?

[2023-01-07 00:01:00] <%hynpo> I feel like replacing a motherboard is a bigger pain, with all of the tiny ass little pins n shit
[2023-01-07 00:01:11] <%Sanglune> @nazzurro Subathon ended, one day break
[2023-01-07 00:01:24] <%Sims112> i meant if it comes with the same plugs and everything

[2023-01-07 00:01:30] <%Houdini111> Different PSUs, even from the same brand, will have pin connectors in different places. You can easily fry your computer if you reuse the cables. Much better to be safe and use the same cables that came with your PSU.
[2023-01-07 00:01:32] <%nazzurro> Ah and I missed him yesterday cirPls Thanks @Sanglune
[2023-01-07 00:01:59] <%Houdini111> @Sims112 PSU cable connectors are all the same from the outside. You can't tell if it'll fry your computer just from looking at them.
[2023-01-07 00:02:32] <!%RobotIsBroken> What is iPhone latest phone 😂 👌
[2023-01-07 00:02:35] <%Houdini111> @hynpo It's the heart of the computer, after all. Or the nervous system. Or whatever analogy you want to use. You're basically rebuilding the computer if you replace the MB.

[2023-01-07 00:03:30] <@%Duo11> Nervous system is pretty accurate cirThink
[2023-01-07 00:04:12] <%Houdini111> yakitsSip Well, it's also the digestive system and cardiovascular system since it provides the materials (power) needed to run everything.
[2023-01-07 00:04:36] <%hynpo> if you're rebuilding your human, you may as well replace the nervous system since you have it apart

[2023-01-07 01:55:48] <@%Toonfish> because I noticed a strange pattern regarding aroma extractions using alcohol. After steeping something in alcohol for a few weeks/months like orange peel in vodka or vanilla pods in rum, I tried blitzing said alcohol with the to-be-extracted material in a high-powered blender and then straining it
[2023-01-07 01:56:00] <@%Toonfish> like even just through a thin metal filter, not even a coffee filter
[2023-01-07 01:56:27] <@%Toonfish> and what I noticed was that the blitzed and filtered alcohol had less of the flavor I was trying to extract then it did before the blitzing
[2023-01-07 01:57:02] <%boldCactuslad> I assume by blitz you mean mix and not drink yes?
[2023-01-07 01:57:03] <@%Toonfish> you'd think the tiny particles of the orange peel/aroma that stay in the blitzed and filtered version would increase the orange/vanilla aroma but instead they decreased it cirLost
[2023-01-07 01:57:12] <@%Toonfish> by blitz I mean putting it into a high-powered blender
[2023-01-07 01:57:18] <%boldCactuslad> ah ok
[2023-01-07 01:57:39] <%boldCactuslad> well i will say that metal filters leave their own taste behind no matter how hard one tries
[2023-01-07 01:57:51] <@%Toonfish> tried it with paper filtration too
[2023-01-07 01:57:53] <@%Toonfish> same result
[2023-01-07 01:58:02] <@%Toonfish> the only thing I haven't tried yet is a cheese cloth
[2023-01-07 01:58:42] <%boldCactuslad> it should enhance the flavor, that would make sense to me. more surface area, more mixing...
[2023-01-07 01:58:54] <@%Toonfish> yeah that was my thinking too
[2023-01-07 01:59:01] <@%Toonfish> but it had objectively less orange/vanilla flavor
[2023-01-07 01:59:10] <@%Toonfish> I did multiple blind triangle tests with multiple people
[2023-01-07 01:59:13] <@%Toonfish> and it was unanimous
[2023-01-07 01:59:40] <%boldCactuslad> why can't you just use the word "objectively" to mean "like for sure, not that we tested it" like everyone else you dang overachiever
[2023-01-07 01:59:49] <%Gelil> Did you try distilling it again? Let the condensation drip over the aromatics, and the heat will extract the oil, and bring more flavor

[2023-01-07 01:59:56] <%boldCactuslad> might i suggest MORE oranges

[2023-01-07 02:00:13] <%Gelil> Ahh ok
[2023-01-07 02:00:14] <@%Toonfish> yes cactuslad that's what I ended up doing cirLaugh

[2023-01-07 02:01:12] <@%Toonfish> @Gelil does distillation concentrate the flavor? I thought you'd lose a bunch of aromatics to the air and destillation is only done to get rid of super unpleasant aromas or toxic subtances cirThink

[2023-01-07 02:01:51] <@%Toonfish> I use a few drops of the orange extract in club soda for orange flavored, no sugar no acid soda and I use the rum in baking OkuuNODDERS
[2023-01-07 02:01:52] <%Gelil> Toonfish Depends on what you are trying to do? If you are distilling the first time, then yes
[2023-01-07 02:02:02] <@%Toonfish> @gelil interesting NowISee
[2023-01-07 02:02:21] <@%Duo11> @Toonfish distilation is done in a closed system so it should trap most volitile compounds if you have a good enough condenser cirISee
[2023-01-07 02:02:34] <@%Toonfish> Duo I should have asked you cirD

[2023-01-07 02:02:48] <@%Duo11> Of course mWOW
[2023-01-07 02:02:48] <%Gelil> But subsequent distilling will dilute, and you can then filter the cooled solution to clarify

[2023-01-07 02:05:20] <@%Toonfish> the orange peel was just peeled very thinly with a knife/veg peeler and the vanilla pods were split open to expose the seeds
[2023-01-07 02:05:26] <@%Duo11> By blitz you mean like, in a food processor? OhISee
[2023-01-07 02:05:28] <%boldCactuslad> just so we're sure you're comparing month seeped unblended to month seeped blended yes
[2023-01-07 02:05:33] <@%Toonfish> yes Duo, high powered blender
[2023-01-07 02:05:55] <@%Toonfish> it was months seeped, then blended and filtered vs months seeped, not blended
[2023-01-07 02:06:11] <@%Toonfish> the orange peel had only been seeping for 2 weeks
[2023-01-07 02:06:16] <%Gelil> Store bought alcohol?
[2023-01-07 02:06:35] <@%Duo11> Hmm I'm not sure. Some flavor compounds are quite fragile so its possible the heat and agitation from the food processor destroys some of them cirISee
[2023-01-07 02:06:59] <@%Toonfish> for the orange peel it was 65% neutral spirit (like between vodka and everclear) for the vanilla pods it was captain morgan white rum cirPomp
[2023-01-07 02:07:20] <@%Toonfish> it didn't stay in the blender long enough for it to get warm
[2023-01-07 02:07:46] <@%Toonfish> I think it might also be additional aromas getting into the mix that cover up the pleasant ones
[2023-01-07 02:07:57] <@%Toonfish> the eggnog I made with the blended vanilla rum tasted kinda muddy
[2023-01-07 02:07:59] <@%Toonfish> if that makes sense
[2023-01-07 02:08:14] <@%Toonfish> the eggnog with just the infused rum was cleaner and more vanilla-y
[2023-01-07 02:08:38] <@%Toonfish> but ye the agitation might to it, like it aerates the mixture too
[2023-01-07 02:08:40] <%boldCactuslad> i uh may have read that as "cum"
[2023-01-07 02:08:44] <@%Toonfish> so maybe some oxidation happening as well? cirThink

[2023-01-07 02:10:23] <%Fenix_TV> What about pregnogg naroHodo
[2023-01-07 02:10:24] <@%Duo11> Yeah, also blending would be destroying the plant-cells in the orange peel which can release different chemicals than just soaking it in alcohol. Like even thoug hthe plant is dead the walls of the plant's cells are made of celilose they're faily durable so some stuff just stays locked inside the dead plant bits until you blend it cirISee

[2023-01-07 02:10:34] <%Demeorin> I missed that
[2023-01-07 02:10:36] <@%Duo11> The blending could be releasing undesierable flavor compounds

[2023-01-07 02:11:10] <@%Toonfish> the blended and filtered vanilla rum was also a LOT more bitter than the unblended stuff
[2023-01-07 02:11:22] <@%Duo11> Yeah that makes sense
[2023-01-07 02:11:29] <@%Toonfish> but I thought that would be a good thing because flavors can often end up bitter if you concentrate them a lot

Supposedly they raised the pressure twice, so it should be more than double the original and supposedly now other residents are happy. The inspector when I moved in measured ~30 PSI. I just bought myself a pressure gauge and measured 40.

[2023-01-07 10:35:05] <%another_tristan> holy shit youtube is such garbage. i havent tried to actively search for something in years but i wanted to find the rest of the undertale playthrough.
[2023-01-07 10:38:15] <%another_tristan> searching "X" gives you 75% things that are not X
[2023-01-07 10:38:23] <%another_tristan> you cant search for just a playlist
[2023-01-07 10:42:31] <%another_tristan> how did this become the gold standard of videos. its completely unusable.
[2023-01-07 10:42:53] <@%Damhain> there might be the small issue of there is no playlist for undertale for cirno
[2023-01-07 10:43:02] <@%Damhain> but thats just a start oldIrish
[2023-01-07 10:43:12] <%another_tristan> what did he run during the subathon then
[2023-01-07 10:43:47] <@%Damhain> none of that was uploaded
[2023-01-07 10:43:54] <%another_tristan> even if there wasnt one i cant find literally any of the other videos except the first one and the pacifist or genocide highlights
[2023-01-07 10:43:58] <@%Damhain> its all been youtube shorts as videos
[2023-01-07 10:44:01] <@%Damhain> for some reason
[2023-01-07 10:44:09] <@%Damhain> i wonder if gambit knows shorts are a thing

[2023-01-07 10:45:17] <%another_tristan> i thought those were deleted

[2023-01-07 10:46:14] <%another_tristan> its not a big deal
[2023-01-07 10:46:26] <%another_tristan> OhIToot
[2023-01-07 10:46:48] <@%Damhain> it would be really stupid
[2023-01-07 10:47:01] <@%Damhain> to have the giant fanfare for the subathon and not have it archived
[2023-01-07 10:48:00] <!%biggdeck> @another_tristan it's in his youtube vod. It's unlisted cirSnack
[2023-01-07 10:48:02] <%another_tristan> i dont mean the subathon in general, he replayed his old undertale videos which were before i found the channel
[2023-01-07 10:48:06] <!%biggdeck> you'll have to look for it cirSnack
[2023-01-07 10:48:37] <%another_tristan> yeah, i just spent a bit. im not good at youtube so if theres a trick i'm not gonna find it
[2023-01-07 10:48:43] <@%Damhain> that was something probably on his old yourube that got shot or some shit
[2023-01-07 10:49:08] <%another_tristan> he was definitely streaming them back from youtube because for a couple of days they were getting lagged
[2023-01-07 10:49:19] <%OhIToot> probably just easier to ask him when he wakes up
[2023-01-07 10:49:36] <%another_tristan> yeah
[2023-01-07 10:49:42] <@%Damhain> why was his old youtube killed? he forgot the password for it?
[2023-01-07 10:50:10] <%another_tristan> if they arent easy to find though, theres a good chance he wanted it that way so i dont want to bug him
[2023-01-07 10:50:17] <%another_tristan> just mad i missed the chance to see some old stuff

[2023-01-07 10:51:08] <%another_tristan> youre not wrong. or vice versa. it can be hard to tell
[2023-01-07 10:51:50] <%meshiura> you know how you used to able to use + and - in google search
[2023-01-07 10:51:53] <%meshiura> they took that away
[2023-01-07 10:51:55] <@%Damhain> if they are all unlisted you wont find it without the direct link
[2023-01-07 10:51:59] <%another_tristan> yes naroDespair
[2023-01-07 10:52:09] <@%Damhain> do you know how to use the internet?
[2023-01-07 10:52:16] <%another_tristan> no
[2023-01-07 10:52:17] <%meshiura> so i guess it's similar with youtube, taking away features that i guess not enough people use
[2023-01-07 10:52:23] <@%Damhain> ah well theres your problem
[2023-01-07 10:52:53] <%another_tristan> from what i understand google decided their advanced stuff confused people who werent the intended audience, and so they decided they should remove the advanced options
[2023-01-07 10:52:59] <@%Damhain> oh i guess aspect ratio is why gambit isnt doing shorts
[2023-01-07 10:53:12] <@%Damhain> shorts do A LOT better now than videos
[2023-01-07 10:53:24] <%another_tristan> well hooray for them
[2023-01-07 10:53:25] <@%Damhain> cause we have the attention spans of rodents tdogRat
[2023-01-07 10:53:50] <%another_tristan> youtube is now being sacrificed to compete with tiktok, a completely different kind of thing
[2023-01-07 10:54:06] <@%Damhain> I would argue its better
[2023-01-07 10:54:16] <%another_tristan> i wont argue either is good
[2023-01-07 10:54:24] <%meshiura> i've only been able to find undertale part 1 and hightlights. no playlist of any kind of it
[2023-01-07 10:54:26] <@%Damhain> but im over being angry at clouds
[2023-01-07 10:54:44] <%another_tristan> thats all i can find too meshiura. thanks for the confirmation
[2023-01-07 10:54:56] <@%Damhain> what good is my dumb ass gonna do getting all pissy over multimedia platforms

[2023-01-07 11:02:41] <@%Damhain> i have also been downloading ela vods on youtube to watch them at work and save a fuck ton of data
[2023-01-07 11:03:40] <@%Damhain> it was doing this really annoying thing before i turned it off called smart downloading
[2023-01-07 11:04:04] <@%Damhain> where it will auto download algorithm baised videos for you to have when ever your not on data
[2023-01-07 11:07:00] <%another_tristan> nice. i liked the video thought i guess it reminded me of seraphim, but, i think i liked seraphim more
[2023-01-07 11:07:32] <@%Damhain> maybe im just getting old but if you told me that song came out years ago i would believe you

[2023-01-07 11:10:02] <%another_tristan> probably wasnt because of the video, but you can never be too sure
[2023-01-07 11:11:07] <%another_tristan> anyways im curious what its like to use yt for music. i cant find playlists of anything i want, let alone specific albums
[2023-01-07 11:11:48] <%another_tristan> so thinking about being able to turn my phone off with that app running doesnt sound like a useful experience let alone something worth money
[2023-01-07 11:11:52] <@%Damhain> give album
[2023-01-07 11:12:12] <%another_tristan> well i wanted to find cirnos undertale playlist
[2023-01-07 11:12:24] <@%Damhain> MahoHuh
[2023-01-07 11:12:25] <%another_tristan> but apparently its private
[2023-01-07 11:12:33] <%another_tristan> does music magically work better?

[2023-01-07 11:14:36] <%another_tristan> ok well how many mitchie m albums are there on yt music

[2023-01-07 11:20:03] <%another_tristan> i still pay for spotify though i rarely use it anymore
[2023-01-07 11:20:36] <%another_tristan> i guess i just hate the idea of using a video service for music?
[2023-01-07 11:20:57] <@%Damhain> its only a video service if you turn on videos
[2023-01-07 11:21:08] <@%Damhain> otherwise its a seperate website and app
[2023-01-07 11:21:14] <%another_tristan> dont remind me about og nier, thats still on my backlog. i didnt even know there were 4 endings when i first played it
[2023-01-07 11:21:45] <@%Damhain> 5
[2023-01-07 11:21:50] <@%Damhain> there are 5

[2023-01-07 11:24:35] <%another_tristan> its more likely ill permanently give up on 3d action games. ive decided they are boring and i hate them
[2023-01-07 11:24:50] <%another_tristan> i'm old enough i can do that

[2023-01-07 11:26:14] <%another_tristan> not only do i think 3d combat is boring it always increases the amount of work you have to do like 10 - 100 times
[2023-01-07 11:26:48] <%another_tristan> its just extremely disrepectful of your time, on top of being clumsy and inaccurate
[2023-01-07 11:27:11] <@%Damhain> thats litterally all games if you wanted to spin it that way
[2023-01-07 11:27:33] <%another_tristan> did you get bored of hitting a mob 3 times in that 2d game? well how about hitting it 50 times in this 3d game
