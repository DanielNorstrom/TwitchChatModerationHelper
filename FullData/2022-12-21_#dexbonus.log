[2022-12-21 15:48:01] <$CrimsonFalconer> It's the default bind for Arrow Keys, the WASD defaults have dash on J and cancel on K
[2022-12-21 15:48:21] <CaptainPensive> It's a little weird to have it on C because that means you can't dash and to right at the same time
[2022-12-21 15:48:39] <%+Helwar> @CrimsonFalconer oh, the binds i used to use when playing snes emulators xD

[2022-12-21 15:49:58] <%+Helwar> actually, my Snes died the same way. Got me paranoid about unplugging everything at the first sign of thunfer
[2022-12-21 15:51:35] <@%ArnarBjornss> @helwar aww unfortunate. My NES still lives although some controllers and cartridges are sorta"tired" and loose (technically my older brother owns it but I got to claim it when I rediscovered it in the attic and revived it).

[2022-12-21 15:53:36] <@%ArnarBjornss> @helwar oh yeah, I should be more careful during blizzards here. My poor PC has gone through a number of sudden power outages while neck deep in powering a game and such (can't imagine it's "healthy" for the PC to go from 100 to dead in an instant).

[2022-12-21 15:54:46] <%+Helwar> @ArnarBjornss if it's a power outage, it's ok. Something might brake, but highly unlikely. If it's a power SURGE, then you're screwed unless your home protection is good, and my old home wasn't specially "top notch" in that regard xD

[2022-12-21 15:56:38] <@%ArnarBjornss> @helwar ah true. I remember an accidental man-made power surge (construction) at my old music school. They had JUST installed "smart pianos" (sorts computerised) and every single one plus the regular computers got fried during that. One of the most expensive mishap I've seen.

[2022-12-21 15:58:30] <%+Helwar> @ArnarBjornss haha, once a schoolmate, while we were in the pcs room, turned around and was unplugging the mouse of someone behind to bother them, and after doing it a few times, he found a button back there and said: What is this? and flipped it. Every single computer in our side of  the room went "poof" with a loud noise, in succession.
