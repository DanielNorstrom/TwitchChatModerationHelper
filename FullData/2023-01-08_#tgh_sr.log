[2023-01-08 08:51:57] <+KING_D3MON> The French influenced some Vietnamese dishes. That's why some food you come across in Vietnamese culture has some French behind it
[2023-01-08 08:52:00] <%Deamonhunter11> Not absol... utely terrible.
[2023-01-08 08:52:07] <+edheadd> the reason american english forgoes -our in favour of -or is because american newspapers used to charge by the letter so advertisers cut costs by removing "redundant" letters

[2023-01-08 09:33:58] <%NinethLions> I'm curious - IronMon doesn't cause the same frustration as ALttP rando did despite also being luck-based, right? Is it because you're not doing this in competition against others?

[2023-01-08 09:35:30] <%+Rozalyndis> i know a guy who made a friendly competition out of ironmon. it's basically a points run where get outta the lab, get 1 point. beat rival/gym get 5 points. whoever has the most points by the end of the night wins and the loser gifts a sub to the winner
[2023-01-08 09:35:32] <Finngus> Honeslty kaizo ironmon is kind of a roguelite

[2023-01-08 14:13:18] <ProSkiller1> I think alliteration is just the first letters but assonance is repeated sounds

[2023-01-08 14:15:12] <abbew123> Is physical/special connected to type of move in this game?
[2023-01-08 14:15:14] <%S17Master> @XSlicer Depends if the mon can have two abilities
[2023-01-08 14:15:16] <jpcicno6> level 23 bone club calling it
[2023-01-08 14:15:17] <%+dermumpfel> it's called jinxing it
[2023-01-08 14:15:22] <%+einlanzer625> itll be petal or teeter dance, and youll be all "wrong dance game!"
[2023-01-08 14:15:23] <@%fsvgm777> I think Soundproof also means you're not affected by Sing, Grasswhistle, Uproar and Hyper Voice as well.
[2023-01-08 14:15:28] <GoldenAxeSOR> even agility would be cool
[2023-01-08 14:15:30] <%+dermumpfel> it always works all the time
[2023-01-08 14:15:33] <Kidsan13> it's so wrong seeing sludge bomb and hyper voice be physical but faint attack is special
