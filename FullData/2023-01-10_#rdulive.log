[2023-01-10 13:36:19] <@%initiate_bg> @jozo08 start paying attention on what the lobby is doing more often, before each fight for example. If everyone is mad levelling then you should level too, if you notice people are playing tempo try to keep up
[2023-01-10 13:36:52] <%HS_blind> you just MarioBLJ then you do some  ppOverheat and then you finish off with  Spoogers . You will always top 3 following this method.

[2023-01-10 16:26:02] <!%ohmygug> Variety had a first look at the second season of squid game, and was really surprised by the huge changes. Instead of surviving childish games the contendants are in front of their computer watching a streamer (and villain of the season) named superGG100 play a children cardgame. The game is simple, you have to chat, but if you are banned, you die IRL. The last survivor gets 6months sub gifted.

[2023-01-10 17:18:57] <%teetime01> @babyybaer it's not sus, battlegrounds doesn't produce revenue as much as constructed does.  So this is a way to balance the equation if you're trying to continue supporting this game mode
[2023-01-10 17:19:15] <+view_bot_prime> if only these experience professionals would listen to my idea on the subject after 15 seconds of thought.....

[2023-01-10 18:49:29] <SubMur> @JaminSully A mouse (pl: mice) is a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.
