[2022-12-30 15:18:27] <%+sar__3> really?
[2022-12-30 15:18:29] <FiskNi> Because buff is applied on skill use, dmg comes slightly after

[2022-12-30 15:19:28] <%ItsDivination> Like Casting Akir and then using the summoner atk pwr buff
[2022-12-30 15:19:30] <Makavelit0t0> i even do that with my gunlancer ult, just to squeeze as much dps possible, thats how petty i am LUL
[2022-12-30 15:19:31] <3ingo> @FiskNi i thought is was obv tbh
[2022-12-30 15:19:32] <+b1ghaze> I found this out on my striker counting my adrenaline stacks, I saw it went to 6 stacks when I charged my LTS and damage was always the same
[2022-12-30 15:19:42] <%rich106848> YEP
[2022-12-30 15:20:01] <fly_round> isn't the third flash step just for more dps on the skills he drops
[2022-12-30 15:20:02] <Xtra_Step> @ItsDivination dmg is calculated on hit, so any buff you get before the skill hits applies, similarly if you lose a buff before the skill hits, you lose dmg
[2022-12-30 15:20:20] <yunyunku> cause he doesn't use energy release before dps in that case i guess

[2022-12-30 15:24:40] <Nozerkg> I'd take a spec bard on my party most of the time lmao. It's the thing about them being rare, and seeing my dmg higher. (ofcourse overall damage is lower)
