[2022-12-19 04:38:05] <%zinix5> it funny how excited I am for you to play this game. I have been really really enjoying watching you figure it out.
[2022-12-19 04:38:18] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Was the werelizard situation resolved?
[2022-12-19 04:38:26] <%EpicPumaNess> good morning Richard and Chat

[2022-12-19 04:39:04] <%+Cynder_Dragon> That should be in the history books
[2022-12-19 04:39:07] <%EpicPumaNess> despite all my rage I'm still just a lizard in a cage

[2022-12-19 04:43:38] <$unknownohyeah> caw

[2022-12-19 04:45:59] <%Erbrand> that makes sense
[2022-12-19 04:46:02] <banksdignity1> 👋
[2022-12-19 04:46:08] <%Erbrand> I have no concept of that kind of cold richLUL
[2022-12-19 04:46:26] <nightperson1> there are also like down socks people buy for winter camping
[2022-12-19 04:46:52] <$NeverEndingPizza> how cold are they calling for it to get there this coming week?
[2022-12-19 04:47:06] <+PurplePoe> swiftyUp
[2022-12-19 04:47:14] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Are they getting wet down there?
[2022-12-19 04:47:20] <Icion> a lot of places in the midwest are going to hit 0
[2022-12-19 04:47:50] <$NeverEndingPizza> I'm in Ohio we are gonna have single digit highs sat and sunday
[2022-12-19 04:48:10] <+PurplePoe> @richard_hammer You got them Squidward sounding feet
[2022-12-19 04:48:30] <nightperson1> can try finding down slip overs for boots or something
[2022-12-19 04:49:11] <Icion> my feet and ears are the only thing that really bother me when i get cold
[2022-12-19 04:49:33] <+Hopvine> Which state do you live in?
[2022-12-19 04:49:50] <+PurplePoe> @richard_hammer Well, I'm working in Ohio now, so I'm listening closely to your advice lol
[2022-12-19 04:49:58] <Icion> would it be possible to jam some hand warmers in your boot?
[2022-12-19 04:50:06] <nightperson1> i know they have like heated gloves for bikers so id imagine they have boots too
[2022-12-19 04:50:19] <%+Felstrike> Work outside for a living, all weather, only thing you can do is get water tight boots, really all you can do
[2022-12-19 04:50:22] <$unknownohyeah> also not an option for you but... if you drink alcohol it increase circulation to your extremities
[2022-12-19 04:50:37] <$unknownohyeah> increases*
[2022-12-19 04:50:50] <%+Zmpr0wler> wool sock are amazing
[2022-12-19 04:51:39] <$NeverEndingPizza> geez 4 pairs lol
[2022-12-19 04:51:59] <+PurplePoe> Get a bathroom and stop squatting outside, stagnant activities....
[2022-12-19 04:52:02] <$unknownohyeah> they have those USB electric gloves... maybe they make socks? lol
[2022-12-19 04:52:07] <$RumNDone_> my wife had the same issue... FEET didnt keep heat. I got her a set of electric socks from amazon last year.
[2022-12-19 04:52:13] <$RumNDone_> spent like 70$ on em
[2022-12-19 04:52:25] <%+Zmpr0wler> yeah that dont work
[2022-12-19 04:52:50] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I hope you're making wool socks for your dwarves for these winters
[2022-12-19 04:53:09] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Gotta keep their fat toes warm
[2022-12-19 04:53:24] <%+Felstrike> Some guys and girls carry dry socks they throw on heaters and trade them out every other hour, I can’t do it because I think it makes my feet colder I just go 24 hours before I take the boots off in a warm place
[2022-12-19 04:53:36] <+lloydrick> heated insoles
[2022-12-19 04:54:10] <%+Zmpr0wler> changing socks is also really good if they get a little damp
[2022-12-19 04:54:38] [Notification] Scootz_McDeezy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! [I didn't know that about wool being the first layer. usual only n3ed 1 pair of wool socks but that's good to keep in mind]
[2022-12-19 04:55:59] <$Sacratoy> When I did backpacking silk sock liners were also good. Did silk liners with wool socks
[2022-12-19 04:55:59] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 04:56:19] <$Sacratoy> Liners wick away moisture
[2022-12-19 04:56:21] <%+Felstrike> I hate the cold anyway, if I’m not working I don’t understand going outside below 20 degrees, people think that’s weird as Iv worked in below zero weather for over 36 hours straight, cold is the worst rather work in 110+ heat all day every day
[2022-12-19 04:56:28] <$Sacratoy> It isn't a smooth silk
[2022-12-19 04:56:45] <+ThatSl1me> damn silk boxers are amazing just gotta find the right ones
[2022-12-19 04:57:03] <%+Zmpr0wler> what is that one big hunting brand that starts with an S
[2022-12-19 04:57:21] <$NeverEndingPizza> @felstrike agree working for long hours in the cold is awful
[2022-12-19 04:57:31] <+lloydrick> sitka
[2022-12-19 04:58:04] <Icion> Mossy Oak is another one where you are just paying for a brand
[2022-12-19 04:58:53] <$Sacratoy> Mossy oak near me is all Walmart plastic
[2022-12-19 04:59:56] <%+Zmpr0wler> you could also get sitka<
[2022-12-19 05:00:17] <%+Zmpr0wler> Sitka's new core warmer
[2022-12-19 05:00:49] <%+Felstrike> Not sure what boots you guys go for in the cold, not a hunter, but my favorite use to be danners, tight lace up to knees, then after talking to the myth busters, Adam told me of bloodstones as he used them on the show to do all the crazy stuff they did, there Australia made and have many many knock offs, but there one hell of a work boot for all weather and they keep my feet dry and warm, not cheep though like $399, danners could run you like $699 though
[2022-12-19 05:00:52] <nightperson1> time to sit on your feet
[2022-12-19 05:01:34] <Junglepants> I also have a similar problem, but I've found out that if I overlayer, like you said you did with the 4 layers of socks, the tightness of the socks can actually make the circulation even worse.
[2022-12-19 05:01:49] <$NeverEndingPizza> I usually just buy red wing boots
[2022-12-19 05:02:10] <$Sacratoy> Men's knee high boots sounds like a safari outfit
[2022-12-19 05:02:13] <+lloydrick> what helped me was less sock . and leave some room in my boots kept my feet warmer
[2022-12-19 05:02:20] <%+Felstrike> Danners yeah, damn near
[2022-12-19 05:03:05] <$Sacratoy> I feel like cold toes are a fact of life
[2022-12-19 05:03:17] <%+Felstrike> Bloodstones normal length though, the danners have great lace ups, you don’t need to lace it so tight you can’t get circulation, just so the snow and shit doesn’t get in
[2022-12-19 05:03:22] <%+Zmpr0wler> permison to post link
[2022-12-19 05:03:27] <$Sacratoy> I don't think I've ever had warm toes hiking after deer
[2022-12-19 05:03:29] <$NeverEndingPizza> just buy some fiberglass insulation to stuff in the boot toes lol
[2022-12-19 05:03:46] <%+Zmpr0wler> https://www.reddit.com/r/Waterfowl/comments/bm9jon/new_product_from_sitka_the_core_body_temperature/
[2022-12-19 05:03:54] <%+Mhoram_> Evening Dick and Chat richBobble
[2022-12-19 05:04:03] <%+Felstrike> I wonder what chat thinks of boots I’m a boot man, hate redwings and all the other name brands, Danner and bloodstones all I can do now
[2022-12-19 05:04:34] <%+Mhoram_> @NeverEndingPizza That is a method of torture lol
[2022-12-19 05:04:43] <%bdres> survived the werelizards and your up to 64 pop? thats impressive
[2022-12-19 05:04:43] <ReformingOne> Hey Richard, we still werelizard dwarves up in here?
[2022-12-19 05:04:55] <Icion> I wonder i theres a way to jam sme sort of electric warming element in the front of the boot and cycle it on and off
[2022-12-19 05:05:04] <$NeverEndingPizza> unless we get a bunch of snow i never wear boots usually in sandals
[2022-12-19 05:05:10] <%+Zmpr0wler> sitka "core warmmer" aka butt plug will keep you warm
[2022-12-19 05:05:20] <$Sacratoy> Once upon a time powered heated boots existed. I don't think it's a thing anymore
[2022-12-19 05:05:37] <%+Felstrike> I work with a guy who uses a drill battery for his jacket to keep warm, got to be something for the feet then surely
[2022-12-19 05:05:42] <%+Zmpr0wler> do you have the battery powered core warmmer
[2022-12-19 05:06:26] <%bdres> core warmer warms your core. its a microwave that fries your insides
[2022-12-19 05:06:26] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 05:06:37] <%+Felstrike> What boots or shoes you hunting with @richard_hammer
[2022-12-19 05:06:55] <%+Zmpr0wler> it was a camo butt plug that Sitka put out at an april fools joke
[2022-12-19 05:06:56] <ThatLittleRedBird> time for snu snu
[2022-12-19 05:06:58] <ThatLittleRedBird> atpGasm
[2022-12-19 05:07:14] <Icion> Amazon has a remote control heated insole for 60 bucks, were getting closer
[2022-12-19 05:07:42] <$Reductive_Reasoning> yet...
[2022-12-19 05:08:01] <+raffkelly> a seat is just an external butt plug, if you think about it
[2022-12-19 05:08:11] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Big truth
[2022-12-19 05:08:20] <%+Zmpr0wler> @raffkelly lol
[2022-12-19 05:08:24] <%zinix5> I found a couple things on Amazon after typing 'heated +toe'
[2022-12-19 05:08:51] <%+Felstrike> Shoe ware is important, going to ask my ice fishing friend what he wears out in Chicago ice fishing
[2022-12-19 05:10:23] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Dude this combat music SLAPS
[2022-12-19 05:10:49] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Also how are those Red Wing boots, I've bought belts/gloves and so far they've lasted forever and been good.
[2022-12-19 05:10:52] <$NeverEndingPizza> how much is this game?
[2022-12-19 05:11:02] <smithtony619> dig water to drink
[2022-12-19 05:11:08] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Did you get out of the death spiral of were creatures or still a looming threat?
[2022-12-19 05:11:46] <$NeverEndingPizza> @cynder_dragon i like mine but they are "steel" toe work boots.  very comfy though
[2022-12-19 05:11:57] <%zinix5> is lizard boy aging? Can
[2022-12-19 05:12:13] <%zinix5> hate typing on mobile
[2022-12-19 05:12:36] <%+Felstrike> Not a hunter my self, for work though I never liked redwings so I’ll just suggest a nice new pair of danners they got below 40 weather rated boots for like $330 with shipping and junk, like I said foot ware is important so it’s not something I be cheep on
[2022-12-19 05:12:50] <$NeverEndingPizza> they are heavier I agree but my feet never hurt standing for 10hrs in them
[2022-12-19 05:13:56] <%$BlaydeX15> aboot what?
[2022-12-19 05:14:42] <$NeverEndingPizza> this fortress had turned around nicely after being down to 1 person
[2022-12-19 05:15:22] <%+Felstrike> I always said a good boot is something you don’t even know is on, like you come home and you don’t even realize you didn’t take your boots off even after 24 hours it just is a part of your foot and it’s not cold or hurting, that is the price of a good boot
[2022-12-19 05:15:48] <$NeverEndingPizza> agreed fels
[2022-12-19 05:16:01] <%+Felstrike> Yeah thanks @neverendingpizza
[2022-12-19 05:16:15] <Icion> When i had to wear steel toes the $40 walmart steel toe tennish shoes were better than my $140 wolverines
[2022-12-19 05:16:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> good boots are def one of the best investments you can make
[2022-12-19 05:16:34] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 05:17:31] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I have to get some real work boots. My socks keep getting soaked when I'm working outside and I'm changing through multiple pairs of socks throughout the day, come back home to my feet being clammy
[2022-12-19 05:17:38] <%+Felstrike> Yeah, my first work boot everyone recommend red wings, maybe because I work outdoor? I just never liked them like I tried so many times, carpenters and plumbers love them by me
[2022-12-19 05:18:42] <%$BlaydeX15> I like my Keen's
[2022-12-19 05:18:48] <%+Felstrike> Also on the discussion, never was a fan of steel toe, just hard leather, haven’t broken a toe yet so personal choice I suppose
[2022-12-19 05:18:53] <%AccompanyingArmor> Dwarfin
[2022-12-19 05:19:38] <Icion> Yeah steel toes arent something you wear recreationally.  The factory I was at made us.
[2022-12-19 05:19:44] <+Rocksmasha> !please
[2022-12-19 05:19:44] <@^Moobot> @Rocksmasha Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-19 05:19:54] <$NeverEndingPizza> I don't like the steel toe they get cold.  i went with composite
[2022-12-19 05:20:40] <%+Felstrike> So the thing with that @richard_hammer if your getting your toe cut off by high pressure water, was the steel toe going to save the toe? I mean honestly if 1000lbs fell on my hard leather vs my steel toe is the toe going to be saved more or less as the steel would just clean cut your toe then. Just questioning that my self
[2022-12-19 05:21:38] <%+Zmpr0wler> yeah in some jobs it is needed but in some jobs it is required that you cant wear them doctors can save crushed not cut
[2022-12-19 05:22:16] <%+Zmpr0wler> i have worked in both enviroments
[2022-12-19 05:22:19] <+Ralekin> i feel like this is a seatbelt vs no seatbelt argument. sure, there are cases where the belt is worse. but thats not the point
[2022-12-19 05:22:33] <Junglepants> ^
[2022-12-19 05:22:59] <+Ralekin> there are SO few cases where a armored toe is detrimental though
[2022-12-19 05:23:29] <%+Felstrike> I mean, I just feel like steel toe vs none steel toe, I’m a safety 3rd guy, mike row joke, you always try to not lose your toes, i just wonder how much steel toe shoes save your toes
[2022-12-19 05:23:33] <+Ralekin> i assumed we were talking about a professional context only though, so that could be on me
[2022-12-19 05:24:17] <$NeverEndingPizza> i had steel toe save my foot getting run over by a forklift
[2022-12-19 05:24:33] <+Ralekin> i went from military to construction tho, so biases
[2022-12-19 05:24:51] <%+Felstrike> Really? Now that’s a story I want to hear a forklift ran over your foot and saved your toes?
[2022-12-19 05:25:13] <%+Felstrike> I have forklifts lifting literally tons of steel if that thing ran my foot over I write that off as gone
[2022-12-19 05:25:22] <%+trevorsgame1> only thing with steel toe is it would sometimes be better to have a smashed foot then cut off toes beacuase the steel toe bent and chopped all the toesies
[2022-12-19 05:25:34] <%+Zmpr0wler> ^
[2022-12-19 05:25:52] <+Ralekin> clean cut easier to treat than mashed potatoes tho, i can say that from experience as a medic
[2022-12-19 05:25:56] <+Nightmareblaze> but the tosies can be put back on, just use duct tape
[2022-12-19 05:26:07] <Icion> if something is hitting you hard enough to bend the steel toe back so hard it cuts your toes then its not going to matter
[2022-12-19 05:26:18] <$NeverEndingPizza> yeah i was standing talking to the driver and my foot must of been slightly forward. he went slightly forward for some reason and it went over the toes of my boot
[2022-12-19 05:26:34] <%$BlaydeX15> you're fucked either way, tbh
[2022-12-19 05:26:34] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 05:26:44] <hiddentalent424> at least with them getting cut off you could get them reattched assuming the steel toe made a good cut
[2022-12-19 05:26:49] <Kiexi> I've heard some stories about crushed body parts. They dont usually end up with the person retaining said limb. On the other hand, cut off bodyparts can be stiched back together.
[2022-12-19 05:27:03] <%+Felstrike> I don’t know if I compare seatbelts to steel toes, I mean now I want to look up steel toe stats, because it’s like 100% better chance to live wearing a seatbelt as opposed to not
[2022-12-19 05:27:55] <+Ralekin> that was kind of my point tho felstrike. its (99%) better, and the remaining 1% is kind of a grey area
[2022-12-19 05:28:22] <+Ralekin> smashed through steel toes is smashed toes anyways, so why not wear the steal toe
[2022-12-19 05:28:27] <%+Felstrike> Ugh I always hate that 1% guy anything can happen a meter can hit me on the way to work I guess
[2022-12-19 05:28:44] <%+Felstrike> Meteor*
[2022-12-19 05:28:52] <%+Zmpr0wler> the nerve ending get cut no feelings left but with crushed toes they can mend the bones with steel rods and screws if needed
[2022-12-19 05:29:30] <+Ralekin> exactly. so go with the 99%
[2022-12-19 05:29:30] <Icion> i have been sitting here a moment
[2022-12-19 05:29:32] <Junglepants> I would love to have a 5 point harness in my car... Just can't justify replacing the seats and modifying the car to support it.
[2022-12-19 05:29:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> if we had a 1% chance to get hit by a meteor oof imagine
[2022-12-19 05:29:45] <%hottiefruits> I just sat down
[2022-12-19 05:29:49] <%EpicPumaNess> I'm fat, I get up and walk around at least once eevery hour just cause I get uncomfortable
[2022-12-19 05:30:22] <%+Zmpr0wler> unless you are in super heavy enviroment
[2022-12-19 05:30:29] <%+Felstrike> Steel toe cost more then hard leather? Hmmm that I want to look into I don’t think that is from experience
[2022-12-19 05:30:39] <%+Cynder_Dragon> LUL
[2022-12-19 05:31:02] <$Sacratoy> When I did logging we wore boots with no extra toe construction. No effect if a log fell on it so we saved some weight
[2022-12-19 05:31:04] <+Ralekin> Steel toed dress shoes only Kappa
[2022-12-19 05:31:41] <$Sacratoy> Logs are so heavy it'll crush the box
[2022-12-19 05:31:43] <$Sacratoy> Sever the toes
[2022-12-19 05:31:55] <%$PrismaticDuck> I wear steel toe / composite for fixing tanks. It's fairly pointless imo
[2022-12-19 05:32:25] <+Ralekin> idk. im used to combat boots, so the extra weight is almost a security blanket thing, and id rather have it than not personally.
[2022-12-19 05:32:34] <%Erbrand> reincarnation!
[2022-12-19 05:32:35] <%$PrismaticDuck> It's for like dropping things like roadwheels on it and parts but like, don't be dumb LUL
[2022-12-19 05:32:35] <+Ralekin> but im also never going to argue with someone to change
[2022-12-19 05:33:10] <%Al_Kappaccino> ive stepped on a couple nails its not fun
[2022-12-19 05:33:19] <%+Felstrike> Yeah that’s what I’m saying steel toe is pointless, I feel like we keep saying it, it’s like the job it’s recommend for your going to lose the toe anyway, my hard leather I dropped 180lbs on at the job and I was perfectly fine
[2022-12-19 05:33:21] <%+Zmpr0wler> i wear steel toes daily because they are only boots that are broken in and feel good
[2022-12-19 05:33:51] <$NeverEndingPizza> i stepped on a board in high school had 2 nails go well into my foot. not fun
[2022-12-19 05:34:00] <%bdres> I was about to say LUL
[2022-12-19 05:34:02] <$Sacratoy> If we ever did chopping we wore chain mail little toe socks.
[2022-12-19 05:34:06] <%+Felstrike> Boots safety is very concerning!
[2022-12-19 05:34:11] <@%BranLan> I'm impressed how long boot safety talk has gone on
[2022-12-19 05:34:11] <+Ralekin> that is completely not true dick. we beat this on a weekly basis
[2022-12-19 05:34:21] <%bdres> this is the most robust boot debate I've heard on twitch ngl
[2022-12-19 05:34:49] <%$PrismaticDuck> It goes to show you have a lot of blue collar workers that watch you.
[2022-12-19 05:34:58] <%+Felstrike> I’ll concede to the sharp vs blunt on steel toe then, I have no frame of reference for that, so can’t say
[2022-12-19 05:35:05] <$Sacratoy> If an axe goes into chainmail it'll stop the cut, but you'll stick break your toes
[2022-12-19 05:35:10] <$Sacratoy> Marginal improvement
[2022-12-19 05:35:12] <%$PrismaticDuck> I count as blue collar. >:(
[2022-12-19 05:35:16] <%$PrismaticDuck> I'm just a mechanic
[2022-12-19 05:35:30] <%$PrismaticDuck> ONE MORE YEAR
[2022-12-19 05:35:33] <%$PrismaticDuck> THEN I'M FREE
[2022-12-19 05:35:35] <%EpicPumaNess> People just need tougher feet, problem solved
[2022-12-19 05:35:35] <$Sacratoy> Still*
[2022-12-19 05:35:43] <+Ralekin> navy got rid of the blue camo, they dont count anymore
[2022-12-19 05:35:46] <%bdres> I think anything that runs a risk of defooting you through steel boots is pro blue collar
[2022-12-19 05:35:51] <%+Zmpr0wler> my current job is the most office work in my life but have work alot of dirty job type things
[2022-12-19 05:36:00] <%+Felstrike> Hashtag built different

[2022-12-19 05:36:11] <%$PrismaticDuck> I used to do that when I was like 9
[2022-12-19 05:36:28] <%EpicPumaNess> I've run over my foot with a pallet jack carrying about 1200 lbs with just a regular shoe and besides being a little sore, I was fine
[2022-12-19 05:36:28] <%$PrismaticDuck> I'd run to the mailbox barefoot on asphalt in the Las Vegas heat
[2022-12-19 05:36:42] <EngeltheFallen> i've done that

[2022-12-19 05:37:02] <%$PrismaticDuck> I bought crocs as shower shoes and I unironically use them everywhere now
[2022-12-19 05:37:08] <%+Felstrike> Shoveling snow in sandals I feel like is just being lazy to a point your like, yeah I’ll do it but I won’t be comfortable while I do it

[2022-12-19 05:38:23] <%+Zmpr0wler> that would be a circle of hell
[2022-12-19 05:38:24] <smilingowl> i realized this is nit the big colonie, what happend?
[2022-12-19 05:38:33] <syynch> What is this thing called snow? I've never seen it. LuL
[2022-12-19 05:38:42] <Ruinkind> 10 bucks?!  You're scamming that boy.  :D  @BlaydeX15
[2022-12-19 05:38:46] <%$PrismaticDuck> We went from "wearing what you need to get the job done" to no underwear in freezing temps shoveling show.
[2022-12-19 05:39:00] <%$PrismaticDuck> Humans are great
[2022-12-19 05:39:00] <%+Felstrike> I don’t get people who do shorts in cold, again I work outside over 36 hours in cold and a few guys actually do the shorts and it’s like good for you I guess? Don’t want to ask age on here but the guys doing shorts are under 30, I want to see them keep doing that in 10 years
[2022-12-19 05:39:22] <%$BlaydeX15> @ruinkind shhhh. free market
[2022-12-19 05:39:23] <$NeverEndingPizza> I'm 35 Fels
[2022-12-19 05:39:42] <EngeltheFallen> 40 still do shorts in cold
[2022-12-19 05:39:52] <%+Felstrike> I weigh 225lbs I hate the cold shorts in cold, I hate you >.>
[2022-12-19 05:39:52] <%$PrismaticDuck> Shorts in the cold if its short burst or if i'm really active
[2022-12-19 05:40:01] <Smatter_Roomie_2> sometimes just runnin hot that day and need some shorts
[2022-12-19 05:40:24] <%+Zmpr0wler> i am jeans year round kinda guy all the time
[2022-12-19 05:40:25] <%EpicPumaNess> depends how cold, but I used to rock the jacket shorts combo, calves are fucking heaters
[2022-12-19 05:40:26] <%bdres> some people are built diff. you can be fighting for your life in 10deg weather and still see some random dude in shorts strolling by carefree
[2022-12-19 05:40:46] <EngeltheFallen> 10 deg weather is not even that cold
[2022-12-19 05:40:48] <%$PrismaticDuck> Sometimes I'll work in shorts if its like 40 in the morning and turns into 70/80 in the afternoon
[2022-12-19 05:41:10] <%+Zmpr0wler> if i am in shorts people start to wonder if i am ok
[2022-12-19 05:41:20] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Wind chill is also a huge factor in whether to wear shorts during winter
[2022-12-19 05:41:32] <EngeltheFallen> yeah wind matters more than temp
[2022-12-19 05:41:43] <%+Felstrike> Christmas in Chicago says it’s going to be -7, as of now
[2022-12-19 05:41:44] <$NeverEndingPizza> low 20s in good unless windy
[2022-12-19 05:41:52] <%Erbrand> what's between shorts and snow pants?
[2022-12-19 05:41:53] <%$BlaydeX15> I mean,  it's time based too. I've taken garbage to the curb in shorts and barefoot in 0f, but 30 seconds wasn't going to kill me
[2022-12-19 05:41:57] <$NeverEndingPizza> wind can fuck off
[2022-12-19 05:41:57] <%+Zmpr0wler> 110 degrees to negitives jeans all the way
[2022-12-19 05:42:08] <%Erbrand> richLUL

[2022-12-19 05:42:31] <syynch> fat dude, I hate shorts
[2022-12-19 05:42:35] <%EpicPumaNess> I'm fat, but I got calves of fucking steel, only part besides my forearms I'm proud of
[2022-12-19 05:42:40] <$NeverEndingPizza> i can't remember last time i wore pants
[2022-12-19 05:42:45] <Ruinkind> My legs have never seen the sun in my adult years until I started biking again.  Not fat, either.
[2022-12-19 05:42:51] <%+Zmpr0wler> i am 5'8" and 175
[2022-12-19 05:42:52] <Ruinkind> I like my jeans, okay?
[2022-12-19 05:42:53] <%+Felstrike> 5% body fat and tall, hate jeans and shorts
[2022-12-19 05:43:03] <syynch> My legs were extra thicc when I was thin, now that I'm fat it's like I'm an elephant
[2022-12-19 05:43:09] <%+JDSmith90> rooSitF
[2022-12-19 05:43:19] <%zinix5> Im fat as fuck and my girlfriend gets mad at me for wearing shorts too much
[2022-12-19 05:43:22] <Line_Noise> Shorts in Australia is just a recipe for horrific sunburn when you’re as pale as me
[2022-12-19 05:43:25] <%EpicPumaNess> I exclusively wear shorts at home, I mostly wear jeans out in public unless I'm working out nowadays
[2022-12-19 05:43:35] <EngeltheFallen> new england that was too
[2022-12-19 05:43:43] <%+Felstrike> I’m like an elephant comment made me laugh
[2022-12-19 05:43:52] <$NeverEndingPizza> pssh i don't even own a hoodie shorts tshirt years round in Ohio
[2022-12-19 05:44:09] <$unknownohyeah> your body does acclimate though
[2022-12-19 05:44:21] <$unknownohyeah> so there's some logic to it
[2022-12-19 05:44:25] <%+Zmpr0wler> i love hoodies and jeans
[2022-12-19 05:44:30] <Ruinkind> See, that is how I feel about shorts, I think they look stupid.
[2022-12-19 05:44:32] <%+Zmpr0wler> year round
[2022-12-19 05:44:32] <Ruinkind> :D
[2022-12-19 05:44:52] <%+Zmpr0wler> i am a hoodie and jeans year round
[2022-12-19 05:45:07] <$NeverEndingPizza> yeah like 60 to people in Florida is cold
[2022-12-19 05:45:18] <%EpicPumaNess> I wish it was cool enough to wear jackets all year round, my fav piece of clothing, but I lvie in texas so it's too hot 3/4 of the year
[2022-12-19 05:45:36] <%+Felstrike> Well the take away from this was get nice boots, don’t be cheep on the boots, save your toes
[2022-12-19 05:45:43] <%$BlaydeX15> hoodies for life. 60f? hoodie. 20f? hoodie. -20f? cold in your hoodie
[2022-12-19 05:46:05] <$NeverEndingPizza> -20f means don't leave the house
[2022-12-19 05:46:30] <EngeltheFallen> -20 is why do i live somewhere where the air hurts my face
[2022-12-19 05:46:45] <%+Zmpr0wler> i love 100 to 60 is my perfect temp range

[2022-12-19 05:47:06] <EngeltheFallen> yeah pain cold is my limit for cold - i hate over 70
[2022-12-19 05:47:14] <$NeverEndingPizza> we have wind chills of -30 coming this weekend going to be awful
[2022-12-19 05:47:19] <%$BlaydeX15> it's -12 right now, gonna be like -30 by the time I leave for work
[2022-12-19 05:47:27] <5slammer> fun fact -40f is the same as -40c
[2022-12-19 05:47:43] <%+Felstrike> I remember 4 years ago Chicago hit a day it was -37 to -40 with windchill, never saw the streets so empty ever, was worried the oil in the trucks would start to solidify that day was fun
[2022-12-19 05:47:45] <$NeverEndingPizza> geez Blayde
[2022-12-19 05:47:58] <Ruinkind> With wind chills you can get some nice -50 days near the rockies here.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 05:48:08] <EngeltheFallen> i am cool below freezing but not below it hurting your skin to just be outside
[2022-12-19 05:48:12] <%bdres> I never heard people confuse the two
[2022-12-19 05:48:24] <%+Zmpr0wler> @5slammer i learned that today also
[2022-12-19 05:48:28] <$NeverEndingPizza> @ruinkind I'm not in the mountains though but fuck that
[2022-12-19 05:48:33] <%Erbrand> @bdres that's because you're in socal richLUL
[2022-12-19 05:48:51] <EngeltheFallen> i remember that -50f being predicted when they meant like -10
[2022-12-19 05:49:08] <Ruinkind> Well, you can deal with those temps with proper gear, with heat, I can't take off enough clothing.  :D
[2022-12-19 05:49:13] <%bdres> I grew up in new england
[2022-12-19 05:49:16] <%ABadTanker> how goes the lizard situation?
[2022-12-19 05:49:48] <$unknownohyeah> ive heard there's not much difference at a point though
[2022-12-19 05:49:51] <%+Felstrike> -50 in the Rocky Mountains, so question, how do the cars run up there
[2022-12-19 05:49:52] <smilingowl> in that regard celsius has a advantage 0 is freezing and -50 below freezing is the same as below 0
[2022-12-19 05:49:54] <$unknownohyeah> like -10f and -40f is the same
[2022-12-19 05:50:01] <$unknownohyeah> idk if thats true
[2022-12-19 05:50:03] <$NeverEndingPizza> i have never heard someone say xx amount below freezing
[2022-12-19 05:50:08] <%+Zmpr0wler> i think everyone would just be happier with Celsius only in their life
[2022-12-19 05:50:13] <EngeltheFallen> no -10f is painful cold -50f is your car may not start
[2022-12-19 05:50:22] <Ruinkind> Any day under -23ish you plug in your car, keep the block heater going.  @Felstrike
[2022-12-19 05:50:35] <%+davidflowers90> the wind really messes me up in the cold
[2022-12-19 05:50:51] <%EpicPumaNess> I can stand really cold weather, but with wind chill its a whole different ball game
[2022-12-19 05:50:52] <RoboTiio> Wind can be brutal
[2022-12-19 05:50:52] <%Al_Kappaccino> humid cold is the worst for wind chill
[2022-12-19 05:50:52] <%+Felstrike> Yeah we launch from inside so they tell us when it’s below -20 don’t turn the trucks off
[2022-12-19 05:50:54] <EngeltheFallen> i remember -20, our school did not cancel and it was painful
[2022-12-19 05:51:00] <%+Zmpr0wler> -23 is the coldest i remember
[2022-12-19 05:51:05] <$NeverEndingPizza> wind chill is just the temp out feels like outside
[2022-12-19 05:51:06] <%$BlaydeX15> below like -15, your breath freezes in your nose. that's like the last sign of super cold
[2022-12-19 05:51:08] <$unknownohyeah> wind chill if youre totally naked lmao
[2022-12-19 05:51:10] <monkeryz> The wind is what always gets me at least when I'm outside.
[2022-12-19 05:51:26] <EngeltheFallen> your beard hair also freezes at like -20
[2022-12-19 05:51:55] <EngeltheFallen> gets weird feeling like sharp
[2022-12-19 05:51:57] <%+Felstrike> I thought beard hair kept your face warm now it’s a detriment?
[2022-12-19 05:51:59] <$NeverEndingPizza> because the wind is not on you in your car.
[2022-12-19 05:52:00] <EngeltheFallen> and hurts
[2022-12-19 05:52:09] <%+Zmpr0wler> we had no power for 6 days i looked foward to going to school to take a shower and get warm
[2022-12-19 05:52:16] <Ruinkind> When you exhale, that moisture freezes pretty fast on a cold day.
[2022-12-19 05:52:28] <cementgolf> DansGame
[2022-12-19 05:52:33] <%Al_Kappaccino> lol
[2022-12-19 05:52:34] <%+Felstrike> Omg I want a thick mustache if that’s true
[2022-12-19 05:52:38] <Ruinkind> I end up looking like a yeti at times.
[2022-12-19 05:52:39] <EngeltheFallen> yeah in the winter i grow thicc chops, the year i skipped them def felt it
[2022-12-19 05:52:53] <+ebagbay> lol thats so foui
[2022-12-19 05:52:56] <%+Felstrike> Worst thing about the cold is carrying a hanky for the damn boogers
[2022-12-19 05:52:59] <%Al_Kappaccino> dam thats serious
[2022-12-19 05:53:08] <$Negarretep> You could have just not told us that and no one would have known
[2022-12-19 05:53:13] <$unknownohyeah> lol
[2022-12-19 05:53:18] <$NeverEndingPizza> just shaved my beard off this conversation making me realize that was a bad idea
[2022-12-19 05:53:27] <%$BlaydeX15> yeah, and get cold enough, and it freezes before it even leaves your nose. lol
[2022-12-19 05:53:33] <+ebagbay> yea but having ur lips sealed is def gross
[2022-12-19 05:53:41] <%+Zmpr0wler> i had the with my eyes and eyes crusties working in a grain elevator
[2022-12-19 05:53:52] <%Watup2613> Whats up Dick?
[2022-12-19 05:54:06] <%+Felstrike> Heated hanky’s for the nose is a must in the cold, whipping boogers on your sleeve or a cold tissue is the worst part of the cold
[2022-12-19 05:54:18] <+ebagbay> technically it was already in you anyway i guess
[2022-12-19 05:54:25] <%+davidflowers90> snot rockets.
[2022-12-19 05:54:34] <Ruinkind> I'm imagining a USB powered hanky, now.  :D
[2022-12-19 05:54:38] <%+Felstrike> No heated hanky’s! You need them
[2022-12-19 05:54:40] <$unknownohyeah> theyre heated if you keep them in an inner pocket lol
[2022-12-19 05:54:56] [Notification] Watup2613 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! [My resub didnt go through when I said what’s up the first time, trying again]
[2022-12-19 05:55:02] <EngeltheFallen> my vape doubles as a usb charger so i am good
[2022-12-19 05:55:04] <$NeverEndingPizza> gotta keep them in your prison pocket duh
[2022-12-19 05:55:42] <%+Felstrike> We were talking about the prospect of heated boots and he’s questioning heated hankeys. :/
[2022-12-19 05:55:55] <+Riptide_Rampage> honestly just waiting for the day that getting lost in the wilderness just ends with you building a science hub with wifi and a dish to send messages to space
[2022-12-19 05:56:20] <%bdres> whats the military doing?
[2022-12-19 05:56:48] <%$BlaydeX15> @riptide_rampage just carry a satellite phone on you. ez.

[2022-12-19 05:57:55] <%+Felstrike> Any news on that game, it looks like the gameplay is don’t starve esc
[2022-12-19 05:58:06] <$NeverEndingPizza> don't starve is fun with a friend
[2022-12-19 05:58:11] <Ruinkind> Don't Starve is a cute distraction for awhile.

[2022-12-19 05:58:50] <$NeverEndingPizza> @felstrike what is wizard with a gun
[2022-12-19 05:58:50] <%+VoicedChimp> F
[2022-12-19 05:59:26] <%+Carnith> Much appreciated! How’s it been going chat?
[2022-12-19 05:59:55] <%Erbrand> cold
[2022-12-19 05:59:55] <%+Felstrike> Wizard with a gun was a game announced by digital revolver about a year ago, the game play is just shown to be the same as don’t starve, so looks fun
[2022-12-19 06:00:00] <%bdres> I think we were on snot sealent
[2022-12-19 06:00:08] <$unknownohyeah> heated hankies
[2022-12-19 06:00:13] <$NeverEndingPizza> thats cool
[2022-12-19 06:00:47] <smilingowl> you missed a colum on the right to roof over
[2022-12-19 06:01:02] <$NeverEndingPizza> can't you play don't stave together solo? or is the solo version actually different?
[2022-12-19 06:01:04] <%bdres> I feel like digital revolver has a lot more good ideas than they have good games
[2022-12-19 06:01:09] <%+Felstrike> @richard_hammer wait why you don’t like don’t starve together? I had that same thought because I actually watched you play it and when I finished the single player I just play the together and it’s the same thing but updated
[2022-12-19 06:01:37] <$NeverEndingPizza> i never had lag issues on ps4 for it
[2022-12-19 06:01:54] <+ebagbay> damn son
[2022-12-19 06:02:01] <$NeverEndingPizza> how do you figure i beat everything lol
[2022-12-19 06:02:25] <%bdres> we spend so much time talking about staying warm only for dick to ice that dude
[2022-12-19 06:02:44] <%+Felstrike> Never had lag issues in solo play, only thing I will say though, the game is tuned to 8 people, so I highly recommend a mod to make the health the same as it would be for 1 person to make it the same experience
[2022-12-19 06:02:58] <+Riptide_Rampage> I played on mobile a few years ago and noticed the lag, does that make me good Kappa
[2022-12-19 06:03:08] <%+Felstrike> I don’t find it fun to hit a giant x8 times a much because your alone

[2022-12-19 06:03:54] <$NeverEndingPizza> i haven't played the single player since it first came out on pc so I dont remember the differences
[2022-12-19 06:04:00] <%$Weeeluu> richBobble richBobble richBobble richBobble
[2022-12-19 06:04:24] <%zinix5> I stopped play League when they changed nidalee because it felt like input delay and so bad
[2022-12-19 06:04:40] <$NeverEndingPizza> I did all the combat in togther and never noticed it
[2022-12-19 06:04:47] <%Erbrand> umm but the game explicitly tells you not to
[2022-12-19 06:04:55] <$NeverEndingPizza> very possible
[2022-12-19 06:05:05] <%$Weeeluu> differnt porting my have less lag issue
[2022-12-19 06:05:06] <%+Felstrike> @richard_hammer so I would recommend don’t starve together again, solo play, the game has had so many updates every character is different now and they added over a dozen if not 2 dozen new bosses, and a bunch of slice of life things like chest sorting
[2022-12-19 06:05:20] <$NeverEndingPizza> i own a computer as well and own it as well but havent played together on pc
[2022-12-19 06:05:21] <Ruinkind> It isn't just a Richard issue, the input lag from DST is a reported issue.
[2022-12-19 06:05:31] <EngeltheFallen> by why male models?
[2022-12-19 06:06:01] <EngeltheFallen> it is painful when you do notice it too
[2022-12-19 06:06:14] <smilingowl> i didnt notice it because im a sloth in respect to reflexes
[2022-12-19 06:06:19] <%+Felstrike> Those were a fun 1000 hours
[2022-12-19 06:06:32] <$NeverEndingPizza> could also be not going from normal to togther makes it less noticeable

[2022-12-19 06:07:13] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Hades 2 is gonna be awesome
[2022-12-19 06:07:20] <$NeverEndingPizza> you ever plan to try 7 days again dick?
[2022-12-19 06:07:27] <+RaffleSnaffle> Shipwrecked?
[2022-12-19 06:07:30] <$unknownohyeah> he played 7 days this year i think?
[2022-12-19 06:07:32] <+RaffleSnaffle> Thought Shipwrecked was cool
[2022-12-19 06:07:58] <%+Mellottman> Supergiant Games does great work
[2022-12-19 06:08:03] <%+Cynder_Dragon> It's surprising that SuperGiant games does a sequel, but less surprising it comes out as fast as it is
[2022-12-19 06:08:06] <smilingowl> isnt hades already 2-3 years old?
[2022-12-19 06:08:11] <nightperson1> could always fuck with mods
[2022-12-19 06:08:14] <%+Felstrike> Yeah shipwreck was weird I think they tried to add the shipwreck stuff to don’t starve together
[2022-12-19 06:08:24] <%+Felstrike> Shipwreck was so weird
[2022-12-19 06:08:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> 7 days has been early access for like 10 years lol
[2022-12-19 06:08:55] <$unknownohyeah> sometimes early access just means "active development"
[2022-12-19 06:09:00] <!%+krainboltgreene> Holy shit you bounced back from the werelizard?
[2022-12-19 06:09:09] <syynch> no
[2022-12-19 06:09:09] <%zinix5> Hades came out in 2018
[2022-12-19 06:09:17] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Hades 2 EA coming in 2023, I imagine summer
[2022-12-19 06:09:24] <Ruinkind> I want Project Zomboid to get some fresh paint, it has had so much multiplayer content, but the solo single player game is where the real challenge is, for me.
[2022-12-19 06:09:34] <%bdres> its technically 0.50. they didn't call it EA but its also not what they consider a full release
[2022-12-19 06:09:34] <Ruinkind> Been like 3-4 years.
[2022-12-19 06:09:34] <+RaffleSnaffle> no but this is gonna get constant updates I think
[2022-12-19 06:09:50] <iLoveYhou> he called it his lifes work
[2022-12-19 06:09:50] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I mean hey, they pulled the EA off with Hades and it worked out well
[2022-12-19 06:09:51] <%+Felstrike> I don’t know I’m still hype for Wizard with a gun :(
[2022-12-19 06:09:55] <!%+krainboltgreene> Just art and writing right?
[2022-12-19 06:09:59] <%+bortz29> i wonder if it started out as DLC and then they just grew it to a full game and said no DLC for Hades 1
[2022-12-19 06:10:05] <!%+krainboltgreene> The engine is perfect.
[2022-12-19 06:10:07] <$NeverEndingPizza> tarkov is early access?
[2022-12-19 06:10:17] <syynch> Tarkov is basically Star Citizen at this point
[2022-12-19 06:10:31] <syynch> Devs figures out that they can make bank on seasonal content, so they never release it LuL
[2022-12-19 06:10:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> wait really lol
[2022-12-19 06:10:40] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Tarkov is beta, not early access, HUGE DIFFERENCE Kappa
[2022-12-19 06:10:47] <syynch> Has been in "beta" for 5 years
[2022-12-19 06:10:57] <$NeverEndingPizza> i did not know that about tarkov
[2022-12-19 06:10:57] <!%+krainboltgreene> Their planned game was going to be a slog.
[2022-12-19 06:11:04] <%$Weeeluu> just follows dayz
[2022-12-19 06:11:16] <%$BlaydeX15> live service. lol
[2022-12-19 06:11:21] <%+Felstrike> If it’s in beta for 5 years, that should just be it is what it is
[2022-12-19 06:11:39] <syynch> Streets of Tarkov releases this year! COPIUM
[2022-12-19 06:11:41] <$Bolbor> yeah if their dream is ever realized I'm done with tarkov
[2022-12-19 06:12:26] <+Riptide_Rampage> imo the only valid tag is beta when used to refer to playtests outside of the studio. all the other ones are pretty much just mumbo jumbo made to sell more
[2022-12-19 06:12:29] <nightperson1> honestly the games bad lategame
[2022-12-19 06:12:42] <nightperson1> it turns into cod
[2022-12-19 06:12:50] <+Kremmel> path of exile has both, a standard mode where stuff isnt wiped, and a 3 month season cycle, could do that with tarkov
[2022-12-19 06:12:57] <$NeverEndingPizza> is that dark and darker like fantasy tarkov?
[2022-12-19 06:13:01] <$unknownohyeah> yep 100%
[2022-12-19 06:13:07] <$unknownohyeah> needs to be fully loot based
[2022-12-19 06:13:24] <Ruinkind> But that is entirely pointless and the vast of majority of players don't play it, other then to test for new seasons.  @Kremmel
[2022-12-19 06:13:37] <smilingowl> aka item saturation and avaliability?
[2022-12-19 06:13:38] <+Shimoroku> the flea market is the major issue for sure
[2022-12-19 06:13:47] <$unknownohyeah> @smilingowl yep

[2022-12-19 06:13:57] <syynch> If they don't wipe, the people who paid $140 for the premium version of the game can't feel special with their paid advantages after a fresh wipe LuL
[2022-12-19 06:14:43] <$unknownohyeah> if you die you lose all your stuff
[2022-12-19 06:14:47] <$unknownohyeah> progression solved
[2022-12-19 06:15:05] <%+Felstrike> Online games current year argument. I miss 2004 when world of Warcraft came out and we didn’t meta and max min everything
[2022-12-19 06:15:14] <%+bortz29> isn't that what diablo 3 did with the auction house at the very beginning?
[2022-12-19 06:15:24] <%+bortz29> they had a player market then trash canned it
[2022-12-19 06:15:38] <$Bolbor> nah not yet
[2022-12-19 06:15:38] <nightperson1> wipes the 28th
[2022-12-19 06:16:00] <%ABadTanker> diablos was a real money auction house lol
[2022-12-19 06:16:02] <Ruinkind> AH was actually pretty successful, it was removed due to P2W outrage from players, blizzard trying to pander to save face from a shit game.  @bortz29
[2022-12-19 06:16:18] <%SkyLineAce> i made so much money on that @ABadTanker
[2022-12-19 06:16:24] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I've heard Tarkov is gonna have drops at the beginning of this next wipe....
[2022-12-19 06:16:31] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Which partially defeats the point of wipes, but hypes up I guess
[2022-12-19 06:16:33] <nightperson1> there are more people playing it hardcore now ithout traders though which is nice
[2022-12-19 06:16:33] <%SkyLineAce> I found a ring that was worth like 100 dollars
[2022-12-19 06:16:35] <%SkyLineAce> lol
[2022-12-19 06:16:45] <syynch> They could just add a permadeath mode, but with the amount of cheaters in the game, it would be horrible
[2022-12-19 06:17:01] <%+bortz29> @Ruinkind ah ok, my bad, it's been so long
[2022-12-19 06:17:01] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 06:17:28] <+Shimoroku> I personally think the game would be better if everything was barter transations, rather than 90% direct currency
[2022-12-19 06:17:39] <%+Felstrike> Diablo 3 action house had a limit of like $250 or something but you had a black market where you could sell things well over $1000, against tos, yes, did people care, no
[2022-12-19 06:17:55] <Xyic0re> traders just give out endless free money
[2022-12-19 06:18:19] <nightperson1> they added airdrops which made that worse lol
[2022-12-19 06:18:49] <EngeltheFallen> he just enjoying a wee bit of the outdoors
[2022-12-19 06:19:09] <%+bortz29> i've never played tarkov so forgive my ignorance, but would part of the problem be that the same loadouts are ALWAYS going to be good/the best and so there isn't much variety between wipes?
[2022-12-19 06:19:16] <Ruinkind> Well, the black market on games like D2/D3/PoE give longevity to the games.  The seedy underbelly of people who want to P2W and bot will always exist.  D3 doing the AH removing the middle man was actually progressive, but managed poorly.  @Felstrike
[2022-12-19 06:19:44] <Xyic0re> they put in all of those awesome early game weapons.. which are relevant for a1 week. so much effort put into programming that stuff only for it to be defunct within a week
[2022-12-19 06:20:36] <Ruinkind> Now they killed the black market entirely in D3, the only thing that brings life into that game is the resets, not a very good design, imho.
[2022-12-19 06:21:03] <%$Weeeluu> i enjoy the recent resets in d3 season stuff
[2022-12-19 06:21:20] <%+Felstrike> @ruinkind well, I love the bot augment, I agree it’s a problem that will always be, however there seems to be a solution to that no one wants to believe to be true, just higher a guy a full time wage to manger a sever, you can tell if people are going to bot with a real GM watching in shifts, but that cost money, so a automated system so catch bots will never work and we will always have bots in everything
[2022-12-19 06:21:21] <+Shimoroku> @Ruinkind its fine imo because they have been running on a skeletron crew for like 7 ears now
[2022-12-19 06:21:33] <+Shimoroku> years*
[2022-12-19 06:21:58] <+Shimoroku> yeah, they still do new seasons
[2022-12-19 06:22:03] <Ruinkind> Oh its pretty well dead aside of their season resets.
[2022-12-19 06:22:25] <syynch> PoE is going downhill in quality because they are focusing so much in the development of PoE 2
[2022-12-19 06:22:36] <$Bolbor> I think for the most part now you either play Diablo or you play PoE and there's not much overlap
[2022-12-19 06:22:36] <syynch> there are like 3.5 devs working on PoE 1 right now LuL
[2022-12-19 06:23:02] <%+Felstrike> No one is talking about the last epoch?
[2022-12-19 06:23:09] <%zinix5> I am loving this PoE patch
[2022-12-19 06:23:10] <%+Felstrike> The last epoch is way better then Poe and Diablo psh
[2022-12-19 06:23:34] <Ruinkind> A company like Blizzard sees the value in having a entire community giving their game longevity.  They ban wave a few bots, they sell 1000 more keys.  There is no value in stopping them.  @Felstrike
[2022-12-19 06:23:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> wonder how D4 will be
[2022-12-19 06:24:22] <%$Weeeluu> hopefully good
[2022-12-19 06:24:34] <$NeverEndingPizza> I really hope they don't pull the diablo immortal bullshit with D4
[2022-12-19 06:24:44] <%+Felstrike> @ruinkind I agree it’s bots make money for blizzard, so why do anything even if it is against your tos. Fixable problem though if you care to is all I’m saying
[2022-12-19 06:24:54] <%$Weeeluu> if i can log onto a server on launch within first 48 hours its better then d3s "launch"
[2022-12-19 06:25:17] <%+Felstrike> I want to say though, shout out to “last epoch” people waiting for Diablo 4 just go look at that game it’s amazing
[2022-12-19 06:25:33] <$NeverEndingPizza> @weeeluu oh im sure that won't happen lol

[2022-12-19 06:27:29] <Ruinkind> They've put a ton of money and R&D into making a very vicious rootkit "Warden" into keeping the ban cycle alive.  Even WoW still thrives on the ability for people to buy whatever gold they want from third parties.  They are very much "for" it.  @Felstrike

[2022-12-19 06:29:09] <$NeverEndingPizza> seems like many mmos anymore let third party sellers function because it's tons of subs for them
[2022-12-19 06:29:13] <%bdres> wtf is a gosling
[2022-12-19 06:29:21] <Ruinkind> Keeps the games alive, tbh.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:29:31] <%+Felstrike> There comes a sad point though in a game like world of Warcraft, like if your not going to bot or pay extra money off a black market your already losing to literally everyone else who is playing, so just play it for fun with your own friends I guess is all that’s left to do with that
[2022-12-19 06:29:54] <%+Mellottman> RYAN! Get yer damn goslings in a row!
[2022-12-19 06:29:57] <%bdres> how do you lose in wow. you just play
[2022-12-19 06:30:55] <$NeverEndingPizza> you really only "lose" in an mmo if you want to be first but aren't
[2022-12-19 06:31:22] <Ruinkind> You also lose the amount of your life you've invested.  LUL  @NeverEndingPizza @bdres
[2022-12-19 06:31:25] <%bdres> spoiler: you're not gonna be first if you have to RMT either
[2022-12-19 06:31:38] <%bdres> just means you're not grinding like the sweatlords are
[2022-12-19 06:32:04] <%+Felstrike> Eh, depends how bad the bot problem is @neverendingpizza, I guess maple story should have taught us this
[2022-12-19 06:32:15] <$NeverEndingPizza> it's literally a game for fun not losing your life if you don't care where you are vs others
[2022-12-19 06:32:45] <%+Felstrike> If your not cheating your not trying, I believe they say
[2022-12-19 06:32:47] <EngeltheFallen> he living his best life
[2022-12-19 06:33:06] <Ruinkind> Its just a predatory world, I put all my priorities aside for my addiction to a MMO for a good year of my life.  I'm glad I woke up from that shit.
[2022-12-19 06:33:52] <$NeverEndingPizza> but it's very possible to play an mmo casually and not put everything aside like that

[2022-12-19 06:34:51] <+Outrider> Is he just unconscious at the bottom of a lake?
[2022-12-19 06:34:58] <Ruinkind> You can say that about many things, in my mind its no different then marketing smoking to minors who don't know any better yet.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:35:16] <%Erbrand> he just wanted to get splashed by some mist
[2022-12-19 06:35:20] <$Reductive_Reasoning> LUL
[2022-12-19 06:35:20] <%bdres> at least the waterfall gave him a positive thought
[2022-12-19 06:35:25] <%+Felstrike> Viking funeral
[2022-12-19 06:35:35] <+Deadmanfoot> I have been playing mmos for around 10+ years of my life
[2022-12-19 06:35:37] <$NeverEndingPizza> @ruinkind doesn't that fall on parents then?
[2022-12-19 06:35:44] <+Deadmanfoot> luckily mny addiction was broken because most of em are shit
[2022-12-19 06:35:49] <%SkyLineAce> "This waterfall looks safe"
[2022-12-19 06:35:54] <%+VoicedChimp> Good night sweet prince.
[2022-12-19 06:36:29] <Pompolonius> How did they end up over there? Migrants?
[2022-12-19 06:36:41] <Ruinkind> The predatory actions of companies are not the sole responsibility of the parents.  It is also on the shoulders of the product.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:36:57] <+Riptide_Rampage> might end up with a cool waterfall entrance this way
[2022-12-19 06:37:03] <Ruinkind> I'd like to see way more regulation when we actually understand the psychological effects of designing games like online casinos better, we are starting to though.
[2022-12-19 06:37:07] <%SkyLineAce> theres another corpse down there
[2022-12-19 06:37:17] <%+Felstrike> What’s the next mmo everyone is hoping to be good ash’s of Eden? We live in this age of min/max I just like to do the single player stuff like subnatica or grounded now that I’m older
[2022-12-19 06:37:36] <$NeverEndingPizza> @ruinkind maybe but if parents don't want their kids playing mmos easy solution.
[2022-12-19 06:37:36] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 06:37:37] <+Outrider> I love watching this game but man it's hard to understand the layers sometimes
[2022-12-19 06:37:58] <%bdres> mmos cant be good anymore. everyone just sprints to endgame and wikis anything that isnt obvious
[2022-12-19 06:38:07] <%bdres> its just a genre of tredmills
[2022-12-19 06:38:24] <%+Felstrike> @bdres agreed
[2022-12-19 06:38:25] <%SkyLineAce> @Felstrike throne and liberty
[2022-12-19 06:38:30] <$NeverEndingPizza> @felstrike star citizen or ashes of creation, but i mostly do single or coop anymore
[2022-12-19 06:38:41] <Ruinkind> I don't think that is valid, they won't learn their lesson until they go through it the hard way.  They will just wait until they are free and experience the crack for themselves.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:38:48] <+Outrider> Like trying to comprehend what's up and down is just confusing me, when a tile is light blue and you're up here, does that mean theres water just way below?
[2022-12-19 06:38:53] <+Deadmanfoot> @Felstrike ffxiv is good but also a giant time sink
[2022-12-19 06:39:52] <$BurnedAether> @outrider you only see like 5ish levels down. so light blue is open air for a bit
[2022-12-19 06:40:36] <$NeverEndingPizza> @ruinkind im not sure i agree.  It's pretty well known anymore mmos can be a life stealer.  it's like smoking crack and acting like you won't know the result already
[2022-12-19 06:40:59] <$Negarretep> I'm not sure my brain can handle what dick is doing here
[2022-12-19 06:41:15] <Ruinkind> That is exactly why they shouldn't exist in their form.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:41:27] <$BurnedAether> dorf trying to become a fish
[2022-12-19 06:41:33] <%Erbrand> if he dies will it poison your water supply?
[2022-12-19 06:41:39] <%+Felstrike> But Diablo immortal makes like a million dollars a day right? So amazing
[2022-12-19 06:41:49] <$NeverEndingPizza> @ruinkind but why people can play them and not be stupid
[2022-12-19 06:42:10] <%Hohen__> I wonder if the 3d viewer for df maps still works
[2022-12-19 06:42:17] <Ruinkind> Oh absolutely, that is why we don't market extremely predatory products to children or in general anymore.
[2022-12-19 06:42:18] <SimonSez> Genshin makes 10x that @Felstrike
[2022-12-19 06:42:31] <Ruinkind> Gaming is a bit wild west and not fully understood yet.
[2022-12-19 06:42:37] <%bdres> not only that, but addicts will seek out whatever feeds their addiction. if a game isn't properly addicting, they'll just move on to one that is
[2022-12-19 06:42:43] <$Negarretep> @Ruinkind we don't?
[2022-12-19 06:42:45] <$NeverEndingPizza> are mmos marketed to children anymore though?
[2022-12-19 06:43:15] <%+Felstrike> I’m mr t and I’m a night elf Mohawk, what’s your game?
[2022-12-19 06:43:21] <$NeverEndingPizza> I would say most mmo are adults anymore playing
[2022-12-19 06:43:46] <H2o_Spez> morning
[2022-12-19 06:43:48] <+Riptide_Rampage> wizard 101 Kappa
[2022-12-19 06:44:12] <$BurnedAether> but Roblox is an mmo Kappa
[2022-12-19 06:44:20] <Ruinkind> I suppose the spam of WoW ads even on television have been forgotten about.
[2022-12-19 06:44:21] <$NeverEndingPizza> roblox and mobile games are def the bigger issues
[2022-12-19 06:44:23] <%+Felstrike> Think of the children is not part of the mmo argument
[2022-12-19 06:44:28] <H2o_Spez> protect kids from fortnite
[2022-12-19 06:44:37] <Goober10001> those guy migrate from the wrong side of the map?
[2022-12-19 06:44:44] <CommunismForDummies> excuse me is that dwarf at the bottom of the river
[2022-12-19 06:44:56] <%+Felstrike> I think tik toc is more of a concern then fortnite honestly
[2022-12-19 06:45:05] <Ruinkind> Those aren't extremely addictive products designed around playing your psyche.
[2022-12-19 06:45:10] <DemonedAway> Advertising absolutely is an issue.
[2022-12-19 06:45:23] <H2o_Spez> no
[2022-12-19 06:45:25] <xix7xix> mobile gaming is way worse
[2022-12-19 06:45:39] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Weird take imo
[2022-12-19 06:45:45] <$BurnedAether> the dwarf is definitely at the bottom of a waterfall. I'm curious how he got there...
[2022-12-19 06:45:48] <Ruinkind> Yes, mmos are absolutely running on the ability to have been run on a hamster wheel running from dopamine hit to dopamine hit.
[2022-12-19 06:45:54] <MommaOliviya> Mobile gaming is worse, since kids think they can charge things to their phone bills. Which most families don't know the ways of blocking that
[2022-12-19 06:45:56] <Ruinkind> It is almost their direct cause of addiction.
[2022-12-19 06:46:00] <MommaOliviya> so they end up getting in trouble
[2022-12-19 06:46:05] <%bdres> gacha games have taken on a lot of psychological tricks that casinos use for slot machines and shit
[2022-12-19 06:46:15] <EngeltheFallen> videogame psychological research considers mmo addiction a myth
[2022-12-19 06:46:23] <%+Felstrike> I think world of Warcraft was original designed by a group of guys who wanted to play EverQuest in a way they couldn’t so they made world of Warcraft to play with there friends, that was the original teams idea they wanted a game they could play together
[2022-12-19 06:46:33] <%+Felstrike> Today people who run world of Warcraft don’t even play the game
[2022-12-19 06:46:54] <Ruinkind> MMO's were absolutely innocent in their conception.
[2022-12-19 06:47:00] <%bdres> did the waterfall guy survive?
[2022-12-19 06:47:00] <MommaOliviya> Hell all the people I meet in WoW are 24+ so I don't see how people say its ruining kids.
[2022-12-19 06:47:03] <H2o_Spez> are pots actualy store liquid same as barrels? are they worth to make?
[2022-12-19 06:47:38] <%+Felstrike> You think you do, but you don’t
[2022-12-19 06:47:38] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 06:47:39] <%bdres> pots are the pottery version of barrels
[2022-12-19 06:47:46] <Ruinkind> I don't think we understood the effect these types of games had on us, at all.
[2022-12-19 06:47:58] <EngeltheFallen> because psychological that effect does not exist
[2022-12-19 06:48:03] <$NeverEndingPizza> what effect is that?
[2022-12-19 06:48:22] <Ruinkind> We've been over this, plenty.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:48:31] <H2o_Spez> is there any that similar to bin?
[2022-12-19 06:48:47] <MommaOliviya> Honestly only game thats really ever effected me badly was league, which I quit in s8
[2022-12-19 06:48:56] <$NeverEndingPizza> mmos did nothing to me differnet than playing any other game. we would just replace mmos with other games as gamers
[2022-12-19 06:49:03] <%bdres> mmos are at least semi-social. lots of kids spend just as much time playing COD and screaming at everyone. thats probably more unhealthy
[2022-12-19 06:49:16] <%+Felstrike> But did you clear the whaling caverns Richard Kappa
[2022-12-19 06:49:26] <EngeltheFallen> as likely the only person here that was a member of apa div 46, def will say that mmo "effect" was debunked repeatedly
[2022-12-19 06:49:33] <$BurnedAether> this fort location looks really cool btw
[2022-12-19 06:49:49] <MommaOliviya> Saying games affect people is just a dumb concept to begin with. Since it doesn't effect everyone, it effects people who let it motivate them into things or don't have the realization that it's just a game.
[2022-12-19 06:49:59] <Ruinkind> I don't think its healthy at all for people to change their priorities from the real world to a virtual one being trapped into their safe space environments.
[2022-12-19 06:50:01] <MommaOliviya> Which a good portion of us know what we're doing and know when to stop.
[2022-12-19 06:50:04] <DemonedAway> MMOs make up such a tiny portion of the market, man. Especially in terms of whales and predatory practices.
[2022-12-19 06:50:38] <%+Felstrike> Henry cavali was just told he was a toxic man for likening video games
[2022-12-19 06:50:43] <EngeltheFallen> people who play video games are better psychologically adjusted than those who do not
[2022-12-19 06:50:54] <+Suffoice> yeah reading that I would think you're talking about VR
[2022-12-19 06:51:01] <%+Felstrike> Video games evil
[2022-12-19 06:51:05] <Ruinkind> Because they are the biggest offenders to building a false virtual world.
[2022-12-19 06:51:29] <EngeltheFallen> mmo mediate existing mental health issues
[2022-12-19 06:51:33] <$NeverEndingPizza> have you seen the real world virtual world are better lol
[2022-12-19 06:51:37] <%+Felstrike> Hammers looking for nails?
[2022-12-19 06:51:44] <%bdres> instagram creates a much better virtual world than any mmo
[2022-12-19 06:51:49] <%bdres> bigger*
[2022-12-19 06:51:50] <Ruinkind> Yeah, that isn't good.  @NeverEndingPizza
[2022-12-19 06:52:06] <DemonedAway> They aren't. I promise you, that. MMOs have more visible worlds to an outsider, but the world isn't the thing that matters to people like that. What matters is getting the next hit, which skinner boxes and mobile gaming is for.
[2022-12-19 06:52:08] <+Riptide_Rampage> i dont think there's anything wrong with virtual worlds, its when you get addicted thats the issue in general @Ruinkind
[2022-12-19 06:52:11] <%+Felstrike> Yes but who is playing the Meta verse, best mmo
[2022-12-19 06:52:15] <blindpositivity> this game got performance issue when u get hella drawves?
[2022-12-19 06:52:28] <+Riptide_Rampage> immersion and fascination don't lead you to throw your life away
[2022-12-19 06:52:46] <+Ghouldude> Does this game like cores, single core speeds, or cache like the 5800x3d has?
[2022-12-19 06:52:47] <blindpositivity> i see around 200 dwarves u get performance issue?
[2022-12-19 06:52:56] <EngeltheFallen> single core iirc
[2022-12-19 06:53:10] <DemonedAway> LUL
[2022-12-19 06:53:25] <%+Felstrike> @ruinkind you know speaking of world of Warcraft, it was so good in 2004 when all we had to chat was AIM or yahoo, it was just a good chat program now we have these phones so mmos are way different
[2022-12-19 06:53:44] <blindpositivity> really i see ty man for the answer
[2022-12-19 06:53:46] <xix7xix> how much ram you have dick ?
[2022-12-19 06:54:16] <EngeltheFallen> yeah it is a known issue for all single core games
[2022-12-19 06:54:54] <3rdlevelwizard> Have you been dumping all the clothes they slowly accumulate?
[2022-12-19 06:54:56] <%bdres> having door? or having no doors?
[2022-12-19 06:54:58] <+Riptide_Rampage> now we have to build the base to specifically counter lag-causing behaviors
[2022-12-19 06:55:34] <$BurnedAether> I know pathing is a big meta thing to improve lag but I don't know how. I wonder if the traffic system helps or hurts
[2022-12-19 06:56:15] <%+Usinji> Didn't you say you had a older processor? I haven't had any lag at 150 dwarfs. like 100fps constantly.
[2022-12-19 06:56:40] <%+Usinji> I'm only on year 5 tho so it probably builds over time
[2022-12-19 06:57:00] <Ruinkind> It will be one of the biggest challenges of the world, to break the dependencies we have on these products, especially by those who grew up with them.  I don't think the changes will happen for a very long time till our behaviours actually become an issue. @Felstrike
[2022-12-19 06:57:19] <Ruinkind> I am not here to tell you how to value your time and life, shrug.
[2022-12-19 06:57:35] <%+Usinji> I in the negatives but I also have my pop capped at 150. I was worried fps would ruin my fort
[2022-12-19 06:57:43] <MommaOliviya> I mean just gives you time to play another game if your not a streamer, like I have 200 dwarves and I just play Path of exile or WoW during
[2022-12-19 06:57:43] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 06:58:05] <DemonedAway> If everyone wanted the same things in life, life would be boring.
[2022-12-19 06:58:15] <%MistaBoogie> I strive for mediocrity and i'm 100% okay with that
[2022-12-19 06:58:15] <$NeverEndingPizza> what does it ruin though i would assume most of us here who have gamed all our lives live normal lives outside it
[2022-12-19 06:58:21] <MommaOliviya> Its just funny that they're having this argument on a gaming platform
[2022-12-19 06:58:26] <%Hohen__> agreed richard
[2022-12-19 06:58:44] <+snakepissdiablo_> striving for excellence is propaganda to make you work harder to make a company more money
[2022-12-19 06:58:54] <+Suffoice> If everyone wanted to make a rocket go to Mars, there wouldnt be anyone left to actually build it
[2022-12-19 06:58:54] <%bdres> thats just a product of capitalist indoctrination. we're told our value is our output, so people think their lives should be maximizing their production
[2022-12-19 06:59:03] <+Riptide_Rampage> @Ruinkind out of curiosity, have you heard of escapism?
[2022-12-19 06:59:29] <%+Felstrike> Shorts in the cold, worst life
[2022-12-19 06:59:34] <Ruinkind> I just said its your life, and I'm not here to tell you about how to run it, I was giving my opinion on a product.
[2022-12-19 06:59:36] <EngeltheFallen> LUL fel
[2022-12-19 06:59:36] <%EpicPumaNess> I have zero ambition I’m content with a good computer and wifi
[2022-12-19 06:59:38] <$NeverEndingPizza> hush Fels
[2022-12-19 06:59:41] <Ruinkind> I don't understand the personal attacks, but whatever.
[2022-12-19 06:59:55] <blindpositivity> where is this subject coming from?
[2022-12-19 07:00:00] <%EpicPumaNess> And a good to sleep admittedly
[2022-12-19 07:00:02] <+snakepissdiablo_> happiness is literally the only life metric that matters
[2022-12-19 07:00:22] <%MistaBoogie> you did the "i'm not racist but..." thing with that paragraph
[2022-12-19 07:00:33] <diablofdb> I'm super happy just living my life how I see fit, working a simple job, earning what I need having free time, enjoying good food, games and scotchs.
[2022-12-19 07:00:39] <+camoking> I like turtles.
[2022-12-19 07:00:45] <Ruinkind> Are you kidding me?  @MistaBoogie
[2022-12-19 07:00:46] <%+Felstrike> Turtles are tight
[2022-12-19 07:00:54] <EngeltheFallen> turtles are psychopaths
[2022-12-19 07:00:54] <$NeverEndingPizza> as someone with severe depression games are a nice escape
[2022-12-19 07:01:05] <+Ellipseis> Convo as deep as a dwarven fortress
[2022-12-19 07:01:06] <%MistaBoogie> I am kidding lol
[2022-12-19 07:01:07] <EngeltheFallen> turtles will destroy all they can for fun
[2022-12-19 07:01:23] <%+Felstrike> Can you get a turtle in dwarf fortress? And if so I want to be that turtle
[2022-12-19 07:01:29] <+Ralekin> also, none of that was even personal. only the words you typed were ever referrenced
[2022-12-19 07:01:38] <EngeltheFallen> had two dogs, two cats and a turtle and that turtle ran shit when he was free
[2022-12-19 07:02:13] <+Ellipseis> dwarves gone semi-wild
[2022-12-19 07:02:19] <Ruinkind> No, I think what I was saying was taken quite personally, and it was rebutted as such.   @Ralekin
[2022-12-19 07:02:21] <$NeverEndingPizza> we can have difference of opinions and it not be personal
[2022-12-19 07:02:28] <blindpositivity> i shouldve known about the performance issue with the game before i bought it its ok tho i bet they will fix it
[2022-12-19 07:02:29] <Ruinkind> I won't take a subject beyond surface level, sorry.
[2022-12-19 07:02:33] <Ruinkind> I'll move on with my own time.
[2022-12-19 07:02:38] <+Pooping_Sunflower_Seeds> how is dwarf fortress , i almost bought it today. enjoying yourself brotha man?
[2022-12-19 07:02:43] <%+Felstrike> Man wish my wife would agree with that @neverendingpizza
[2022-12-19 07:02:46] <+Ralekin> sure, it could be interpreted as an attack on your words. that isnt the same as a personal attack
[2022-12-19 07:02:50] <%+Usinji> We're in the middle of technology changing the world in ways we can't be prepared for. Something humans have been doing forever is adapting to our changing environment. If we can handle cars and nukes we can handle mmo's.
[2022-12-19 07:03:07] <%MistaBoogie> Can we name one of the birds Foghorn Leghorn?
[2022-12-19 07:03:31] <+Ellipseis> you enjoy disagreeing? no you don't KappaHD
[2022-12-19 07:03:35] <$NeverEndingPizza> @felstrike lmao just give up on that one marriage doesnt count she is always right lol
[2022-12-19 07:03:40] <$BurnedAether> @blindpositivity unfortunately I don't know if they will. it's been a problem for a while and it may only minorly get better
[2022-12-19 07:03:41] <!%Ellieanna> I am offended you aren't offended
[2022-12-19 07:03:54] <+Riptide_Rampage> I have a professor like that. He thinks one of the greatest things about universities is that its pretty much meant for constructive disagreement LUL
[2022-12-19 07:03:59] <%+Felstrike> I only take offense to boot safety
[2022-12-19 07:04:11] <blindpositivity> oh really damn sad this game is really good
[2022-12-19 07:04:11] <phillymilksteak> thats all well and good, but if you disagree with me about boot safety, you're a monster :)
[2022-12-19 07:04:18] <+Riptide_Rampage> awooga?
[2022-12-19 07:04:27] <EngeltheFallen> a new lady friend?
[2022-12-19 07:04:30] <$NeverEndingPizza> @felstrike and cold weather shorts apparently
[2022-12-19 07:04:34] <+Ellipseis> lady friend? HahaSweat
[2022-12-19 07:04:42] <+RaffleSnaffle> How did you feel about Andor Richard??
[2022-12-19 07:04:48] <!%Ellieanna> you could just say "My friend and I" and like not use genders
[2022-12-19 07:04:52] <+RaffleSnaffle> this is a test on good opinions
[2022-12-19 07:05:13] <%+trevorsgame1> off topic but elon tweeted a poll today about if he shoule be the face of twitter or not and i found it funny he is using that as his choice
[2022-12-19 07:05:16] <+Riptide_Rampage> yea, this professor is also a huge tolkien nerd (he teaches a class called Fantasy where he just talks about LOTR the whole time) so i had the fun of talking with him about the Rings of Power when it came out
[2022-12-19 07:05:38] <+snakepissdiablo_> who needs trees anyway?
[2022-12-19 07:05:46] <%+Felstrike> Twitter is a blue bird that’s the face of twitter
[2022-12-19 07:05:56] <%bdres> @trevorsgame1 hes not. hes getting forced out by the board and wants to make it seem like it was his own choice
[2022-12-19 07:06:28] <$NeverEndingPizza> tesla board? because twitter doesnt have a board anymore
[2022-12-19 07:06:39] <EngeltheFallen> tesla board most likely
[2022-12-19 07:06:49] <EngeltheFallen> they lose money everytime we tweets
[2022-12-19 07:06:53] <+RaffleSnaffle> I am so sick of hearing about Elon
[2022-12-19 07:06:56] <+Riptide_Rampage> dont tell anyone but one of my favorite things is being wrong because then someone can correct me and we can have a conversation together LUL
[2022-12-19 07:07:27] <$NeverEndingPizza> yeah they lost like 50% since he said he wanted to buy twitter in april
[2022-12-19 07:07:35] <+nomnom345> how comes the dwarven castle making?
[2022-12-19 07:07:39] <%bdres> @NeverEndingPizza its a legal requirement for a publicly traded company to have a board
[2022-12-19 07:07:44] <%+Felstrike> Can we talk about Bilbao?
[2022-12-19 07:07:44] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 07:07:53] <%$mord_> @Richard_Hammer if you haven't seen it there has been some talk about solving some sources of fps death in the steam version by checking errorlog.txt in the installation directory. it can reveal stuff like stuck dorfs trying to path every tick
[2022-12-19 07:07:59] <$NeverEndingPizza> @bdres twitter isnt public anymore
[2022-12-19 07:08:01] <+Riptide_Rampage> @Richard_Hammer its worth mentioning that he was talking more about the actual purpose Tolkien had for writing the LOTR and middle earth (which was one of reenchanting the world in a post-industrial society) very interesting stuff
[2022-12-19 07:08:19] <%+Felstrike> O when Sam said I can’t carry the ring for you master Frodo, but I can carry you
[2022-12-19 07:08:27] <%bdres> @NeverEndingPizza oh ok
[2022-12-19 07:08:30] <%serilleous> Important quesiton, is Sam the top?  or Frodo?
[2022-12-19 07:08:38] <+Riptide_Rampage> definitely LUL
[2022-12-19 07:08:50] <%serilleous> tbh, I feel like Sam is a power bottom.
[2022-12-19 07:08:57] <$SomeRandomBob> Sam bottom imo
[2022-12-19 07:08:59] <$BurnedAether> they are both switches I feel.
[2022-12-19 07:09:11] <+RaffleSnaffle> @Richard_Hammer have you watched Andor?
[2022-12-19 07:09:13] <+Riptide_Rampage> imo they're both bottoms but Sam really wants Frodo to top
[2022-12-19 07:09:15] <3rdlevelwizard> Power bottom.
[2022-12-19 07:09:16] <+camoking> Frodo bottom 2024
[2022-12-19 07:09:18] <%+12yno> he's not a bottom, trust me, i know a thing or two
[2022-12-19 07:09:24] <%BGa9> true
[2022-12-19 07:09:28] <$SomeRandomBob> FaIr point, but Sam is a pleaser
[2022-12-19 07:09:28] <%serilleous> Frodo doesn't deserve Sam.
[2022-12-19 07:09:44] <+Riptide_Rampage> Sam also has a wife and child so he does totally fuck
[2022-12-19 07:09:46] <%+Felstrike> Frodo doesn’t deserve Sam is true
[2022-12-19 07:09:59] <+RaffleSnaffle> actually based
[2022-12-19 07:10:10] <$SomeRandomBob> The movies did make Frodo into more of a whiny brat than the books did
[2022-12-19 07:10:35] <%+Felstrike> @richard_hammer what’s your favorite fiction tv show then
[2022-12-19 07:10:36] <%serilleous> oh god.  I HATE when the main plot driver is poor communication, and thats like %90 of shows/movies.
[2022-12-19 07:10:39] <%Hohen__> no drama
[2022-12-19 07:10:40] <$NeverEndingPizza> woah woah woah talking is going to far
[2022-12-19 07:10:44] <%bdres> maybe I'm just old and jaded but I feel like contemporary storytelling is substantially bad writing
[2022-12-19 07:10:45] <+gudrunix> clearly tom bombadil is the best choice
[2022-12-19 07:10:50] <3rdlevelwizard> Shits creek was good about that.
[2022-12-19 07:10:53] <+Riptide_Rampage> to me, there's nothing more frustrating than when the whole plot can be solved with either a minute of thinking or a solid conversation
[2022-12-19 07:11:13] <$isoseeyo_u> bullet train was ass
[2022-12-19 07:11:25] <+RaffleSnaffle> it's funny that happens IRL tho because people talk past each other when mad and can be terrible communicators
[2022-12-19 07:11:25] <%+12yno> is there a kurt vonnegut book you really enjoy
[2022-12-19 07:11:31] <+Savageblackduck> "the plot would be solved in 5 minutes if any one character was not an idiot"
[2022-12-19 07:11:33] <+gudrunix> Wednesday hasnt been bad
[2022-12-19 07:11:48] <+RaffleSnaffle> I usually really hate most TV and would rather play games, but Andor killed it. Fantastic
[2022-12-19 07:12:00] <3rdlevelwizard> Just finished Atlanta.  F-ing loved it.
[2022-12-19 07:12:01] <%+Felstrike> I fell like rich watch’s NCIS in his off time
[2022-12-19 07:13:08] <$isoseeyo_u> last shows I remember liking was Better Call Saul and Righteous Gemstones
[2022-12-19 07:13:14] <+RaffleSnaffle> real crime is where it's at. Anything fake suck dick
[2022-12-19 07:13:18] <diablofdb> I was disapointed in the last season of the Rookie but loved the first 2 ones
[2022-12-19 07:13:19] <The_Doktah> philip galliglian you say
[2022-12-19 07:13:19] <+JohnTimbre> Early Castle was pretty good.
[2022-12-19 07:13:34] <%+Felstrike> Wednesday has been enjoyable I agree to that
[2022-12-19 07:13:34] <%bdres> I really enjoyed andor but I might be the only scifi guy in chat
[2022-12-19 07:13:49] <+RaffleSnaffle> nah Expanse was awesome too @bdres
[2022-12-19 07:13:55] <$NeverEndingPizza> firefly is his best work
[2022-12-19 07:14:02] <%serilleous> Nathan Fillion is every mans Jack Harkness.
[2022-12-19 07:14:11] <%hottiefruits> butts? richHoggers
[2022-12-19 07:14:14] <+Dracolysis> I liked Expanse a lot too
[2022-12-19 07:14:19] <Stormfury_Thunderpants> firefly goated
[2022-12-19 07:14:23] <%+Felstrike> Black widow must of been a downer of a movie then
[2022-12-19 07:14:33] <+skagator> The Richard but. Aka The dick butt
[2022-12-19 07:14:34] <%$mord_> It would be real nice to get a star wars story that isn't set in the same ~40 year period as everything else
[2022-12-19 07:14:46] <+RaffleSnaffle> @Richard_Hammer true, but they introduced a ton of neat characters and those they had freedom to do what they wanted with. Best thing was no stupid cameos
[2022-12-19 07:15:02] <%bdres> thats exactly why I liked andor though. it explored the oppression of empire and the mess the resistant has to make. it doesn't really matter thats the destiny is predefined
[2022-12-19 07:15:07] <The_Doktah> the "richard but" is the second best type, after ass
[2022-12-19 07:15:09] <+RaffleSnaffle> Mommy Mothma
[2022-12-19 07:15:37] <%+Felstrike> That’s why he couldn’t get into better call Saul, you know where it needs to end
[2022-12-19 07:15:38] <+RaffleSnaffle> TRUE, but still a GOATED first season
[2022-12-19 07:15:55] <+RaffleSnaffle> made Star Wars watchable by real adults
[2022-12-19 07:15:56] <3rdlevelwizard> It was interesting seeing people playing compelling characters who were essentially nazis.
[2022-12-19 07:16:14] <$NeverEndingPizza> they need to either move much further in future or back to like old republic era
[2022-12-19 07:16:36] <%bdres> I think rian johnson is doing an old republic movie
[2022-12-19 07:16:42] <+skagator> Disney is wholly uninterested in producing anything that’s not easily tied to a proven winner. We are lucky Mando season 1 ever got green lit
[2022-12-19 07:16:44] <%+Felstrike> But are you excited for Indian jones 5 played by a 95 year old man
[2022-12-19 07:17:01] <+RaffleSnaffle> Richard Disney has no idea what to do with the STar Wars IP they bought lol
[2022-12-19 07:17:22] <%bdres> Im still not over harrison ford showing up to blade runner in his wednesday afternoon clothes
[2022-12-19 07:17:22] <$Zanoxis> i mean, they have, but its in the comics and books
[2022-12-19 07:17:31] <+skagator> I don’t think that’s true. Star Wars has printed a LOT of money since they acquired it
[2022-12-19 07:17:35] <$NeverEndingPizza> yeah they could do other parts of the galaxy but I would just like to see other time periods
[2022-12-19 07:17:41] <diablofdb> you ever tried a game in a sinister, haunted or terrifying zone in DF?
[2022-12-19 07:17:43] <+skagator> Way more than Star Wars made before Disney
[2022-12-19 07:17:50] <+RaffleSnaffle> @skagator that's what kills me with Andor. Like how did this show get greenlit. It takes chances and has actual good writing

[2022-12-19 07:18:10] <The_Doktah> stairs to nowhere, even more foreboding than doors to nowhere
[2022-12-19 07:18:10] <%bdres> might have drawn a down stair over an updown star
[2022-12-19 07:18:25] <+RaffleSnaffle> Luthen's speech blew me away. I thought there was nothing in the tank for Disney star wars, but I guess it just took hiring the right guy
[2022-12-19 07:18:32] <$Zanoxis> btw, new colony today or is this lizard world
[2022-12-19 07:18:34] <+RaffleSnaffle> that wasnt even a SW fan lmao
[2022-12-19 07:18:37] <+pupupuputter> there should be a full series on jabas sex trafficking ring
[2022-12-19 07:18:56] <%bdres> can anyone on the surface mine?
[2022-12-19 07:19:42] <%bdres> the tombs grew 5 sizes this day
[2022-12-19 07:19:45] <+RaffleSnaffle> Slowly, gently... this is how a fort dies
[2022-12-19 07:19:46] <+Ralekin> whats the well room on the surface for? just water, or can you fish there?
[2022-12-19 07:20:21] <+sevwall_nefastus> I just started trying to learn this game. It’s complex.
[2022-12-19 07:20:44] <The_Doktah> if i had a nickel for every time i went insane and forgot what i was working on
[2022-12-19 07:20:53] <$NeverEndingPizza> alright im off to bed. hopefully no werelizards today
[2022-12-19 07:20:56] <%+Felstrike> This game reminds me of Lego rock raiders and I just want to play Lego rock raiders
[2022-12-19 07:22:47] <+radical_jack_> just started actually diving into the military tab, seems nigh impossible to get them to wear uniforms when not training, so annoyed
[2022-12-19 07:23:58] <!%Ellieanna> you have fake dorfs, that is why
[2022-12-19 07:24:04] <!%Ellieanna> real dorfs want to mine
[2022-12-19 07:24:09] <%bdres> @radical_jack_ theres an option for that. ill dm you
[2022-12-19 07:24:14] <CallMeHanna_> Diggy diggy hold
[2022-12-19 07:24:24] <%bdres> oh nm i cant
[2022-12-19 07:24:48] <%+Felstrike> Waterfall frozen? How cold does it need to be to freeze a waterfall
[2022-12-19 07:25:02] <+Seriack> Oh, I think I know why they weren't going to dig those stairs.
[2022-12-19 07:25:47] <$cpt_obvious1337> @Felstrike below freezing
[2022-12-19 07:26:00] <%+Felstrike> No shit
[2022-12-19 07:26:30] <+Riptide_Rampage> below freezing or negative temps?
[2022-12-19 07:26:31] <$cpt_obvious1337> rikkuSip
[2022-12-19 07:26:56] <diablofdb> I think there are some ways to keep water unfrozen to keep fishing and all of that
[2022-12-19 07:27:13] <%+Felstrike> That would be a sight outside of Zelda oot never seen a frozen waterfall

[2022-12-19 07:37:53] <%zinix5> That or fish I think
[2022-12-19 07:38:20] <%+MrZev> does that mean you just add pepperoni, or do you throw in some sauce as well?
[2022-12-19 07:38:28] <phillymilksteak> Sounds like a calzone
[2022-12-19 07:38:40] <+pupupuputter> you just add a lil pizza sauce and pepperoni to a grilled cheese and use mozzarella
[2022-12-19 07:38:50] <%+Usinji> Its the thought that counts lol
[2022-12-19 07:39:21] <phillymilksteak> Yeah, a calzone but with bread instead of pizza dough

[2022-12-19 07:40:00] <Viperbmf> bread burgers was a normal thing for me
[2022-12-19 07:40:06] <%+MrZev> Those are called Patty Melts
[2022-12-19 07:40:11] <phillymilksteak> ^
[2022-12-19 07:40:11] <banksdignity1> i prefer it on regular bread tbh
[2022-12-19 07:40:12] <nightperson1> that was with hotdogs in my house
[2022-12-19 07:40:25] <banksdignity1> you can add more toppings that way
[2022-12-19 07:40:26] <+pupupuputter> or a bsked pizza sloppy joe you use pizza sauce in sloppy joe and add pepperoni and cheese on top
[2022-12-19 07:40:28] <+snakepissdiablo_> yeah hotdogs and hamburgers lol
[2022-12-19 07:40:29] <Xyic0re> we never had buns, 2 buns was the price of a whole loaf of bread
[2022-12-19 07:40:32] <%+MrZev> you can buy those at our fast food burger places
[2022-12-19 07:40:56] <Viperbmf> she was lying for sure, haha

[2022-12-19 07:41:19] <%+MrZev> patty melts are good.
[2022-12-19 07:41:20] <phillymilksteak> Negotiations stalled due to lack of buns
[2022-12-19 07:41:24] <sosoFortress> revelations buns 1:01
[2022-12-19 07:41:39] <!%Calastigro> not the first time dick has had revelations about buns
[2022-12-19 07:41:42] <SimonSez> Reminds med of Eddie Murphy standup "Raw" He had a bit about "house burgers"
[2022-12-19 07:42:04] <+pupupuputter> I started making dinner when I was 12 and mom got a job I made sure there was proper buns for food I made
[2022-12-19 07:42:05] <Viperbmf> jeez
[2022-12-19 07:42:08] <+Riptide_Rampage> she's just holding onto it for when you visit!
[2022-12-19 07:42:44] <!%Ellieanna> I found mustard in the fridge that expired a year ago, it got tossed tonight
[2022-12-19 07:42:56] <+Riptide_Rampage> man, I was just pointing out today to my mom that there's stuff in our freeze we've been "meaning to eat" since we bought the house LUL
[2022-12-19 07:42:56] <The_Doktah> startling realizations on stream with dick hammer. "i fucked an ass," "there were never any buns"
[2022-12-19 07:43:07] <!%Calastigro> a couple years ago my brother and i got our parents to get rid of some canned cuttlefish that was in the pantry since the '70s
[2022-12-19 07:43:15] <!%Ellieanna> MY MOTHER DOES
[2022-12-19 07:43:20] <+Riptide_Rampage> i think that's what spring cleaning i supposed to be
[2022-12-19 07:43:25] <phillymilksteak> If its not growing the black plague, its fine
[2022-12-19 07:43:38] <!%Ellieanna> She grabs a garbage bag every spring, and goes through her pantry and tosses expired stuff
[2022-12-19 07:43:39] <The_Doktah> @Calastigro mmm, fermented botulism, just like mom used to make
[2022-12-19 07:43:48] <Xyic0re> LFP-tip - if you are starting a new job let them believe that you have kids. That way you will be more likely to get the flexibility and leave dates that you want
[2022-12-19 07:44:04] <SimonSez> Expiration dates mean nothing to me. If it's bad you'll usually smell it
[2022-12-19 07:44:15] <%lord_vron> I always play the risky game of if it still smells good then I maybe I should try it
[2022-12-19 07:44:24] <+Riptide_Rampage> I caught covid a few days ago and my Advil was expired in 2019 LUL
[2022-12-19 07:44:33] <+pupupuputter> try 2 year old jarred meat it was scary but still good if done right before storage
[2022-12-19 07:44:52] <!%Calastigro> only 7 years old?
[2022-12-19 07:44:56] <%zinix5> I have customers that come in once a year after cleaning out their stuff and donate them
[2022-12-19 07:45:05] <+Riptide_Rampage> canned...venison?
[2022-12-19 07:45:28] <$Zanoxis> its not likely to kill you...so you should try it. you may like it
[2022-12-19 07:45:43] <!%Calastigro> traditionally, canning something means boiling the shit out of it
[2022-12-19 07:45:46] <%TwitchingTarget> its so good
[2022-12-19 07:46:06] <%lord_vron> also is it a true use by date or is it best by date?
[2022-12-19 07:46:10] <$Zanoxis> my favorite thing i tried was deer jerky...never had it before my cousin made me eat it lol
[2022-12-19 07:46:12] <+pupupuputter> a lil citrus goes long way in tenderizing venison
[2022-12-19 07:46:19] <+Riptide_Rampage> as a general rule of thumb, if putting something in my mouth will make me feel worse than not putting it in, im not going to do it
[2022-12-19 07:46:20] <ItsHooligan> hello dick and chat how goes the stream
[2022-12-19 07:46:29] <nightperson1> hard pass on anything someone canned themselves
[2022-12-19 07:46:48] <Xyic0re> 1 can 1 venison 1 orange. boom tender meat
[2022-12-19 07:47:03] <%Heroic_Platypus> what do you like putting in your mouth tho richNotes
[2022-12-19 07:47:03] <!%Calastigro> yeah, if you fuck up canning, you're creating some real dangerous shit
[2022-12-19 07:47:07] <%+SlashSteel11> yup
[2022-12-19 07:47:12] <!%Calastigro> yeah, he was trying to ferment a sauce
[2022-12-19 07:47:18] <+Riptide_Rampage> only home-canned thing im willing to try is my grandparent's fruit preserves
[2022-12-19 07:47:25] <+Outrider> Certainly sounds like a justin thing to do
[2022-12-19 07:47:32] <%hottiefruits> also repeatedly got chilli in his eyes because he didn't wear gloves
[2022-12-19 07:47:32] <%bdres> whats your #1 hot sauce
[2022-12-19 07:47:44] <ItsHooligan> gooses are birds?
[2022-12-19 07:47:57] <%lord_vron> I mean to be fair I would not try anything a couple years past the date on the can... or if the can is bulging if its bulging it went bad no mater the age
[2022-12-19 07:48:00] <+Outrider> What's he been up to, it's been forever since I've seen a stream with him around
[2022-12-19 07:48:06] <%hottiefruits> did he lose his christmas map?
[2022-12-19 07:48:17] <phillymilksteak> Yeah some stuff is safer to can than others. Fruits with a little acidity are safer I think
[2022-12-19 07:48:22] <+Riptide_Rampage> someone get that man an advent calendar
[2022-12-19 07:48:24] <$Zanoxis> now i wanna make bottled cannaoil and just let it sit for 10 years
[2022-12-19 07:48:45] <blockington99> the whole christmas map conversation from mario kart years ago will be my favorite thing forever
[2022-12-19 07:48:49] <!%Calastigro> chat, how do y'all feel about spam? I love the stuff, fried up
[2022-12-19 07:48:56] <$Chucklesjs> !please
[2022-12-19 07:48:56] <@^Moobot> @Chucklesjs Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-19 07:48:59] <blockington99> and the fact he's still confused after the conversation makes it better
[2022-12-19 07:49:00] <ItsHooligan> spam is great
[2022-12-19 07:49:07] <!%Calastigro> i make spam musubi and it's richHamjob
[2022-12-19 07:49:12] <ItsHooligan> some fried spam on a sandwhich
[2022-12-19 07:49:14] <%bdres> are they climbing the wall or something?
[2022-12-19 07:49:47] <$Zanoxis> so, i never got an answer, is this the were lizard colony from last night? or a new one?
[2022-12-19 07:50:18] <%DerekTheDeliman> I had 4 dwarves walking on a river as it unfroze today and all 4 drowned

[2022-12-19 07:50:44] <Viperbmf> i learned how dangerous bridges are today
[2022-12-19 07:50:54] <SimonSez> He's got 78 dwarfs @Zanoxis This colony is probably a couple of streams old

[2022-12-19 07:56:32] <+radical_jack_> its awful lol
[2022-12-19 07:56:32] <%+MrZev> positive on steam so far
[2022-12-19 07:56:36] <!%Calastigro> very positive reviews on steam
[2022-12-19 07:56:39] <sosoFortress> double the jobs, don't know about this
[2022-12-19 07:56:42] <+Thrawn20> it's pretty good
[2022-12-19 07:57:09] <%bdres> I never heard about this
[2022-12-19 07:57:11] <%lord_vron> hey now I am a one job kind of guy.... two is just to complicated
[2022-12-19 07:57:11] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I've watched a couple people play it
[2022-12-19 07:57:13] <$Zanoxis> i havent seen anyone i watch stream it...so i had no clue either
[2022-12-19 07:57:38] <%Heroic_Platypus> so like.... are we going on the trail?
[2022-12-19 07:57:44] <wzrdn> the river crossing guide is played by henry cavill in oregon trail
[2022-12-19 07:58:04] <$Zanoxis> thats cool
[2022-12-19 07:58:15] <%Dyrk> you have died of dysentary
[2022-12-19 07:58:19] <%$GrumpSH> think i've seen someone playing it recently on  twitch
[2022-12-19 07:58:25] <wzrdn> please don't believe me I am just trying to be funny
[2022-12-19 07:58:29] <%+SlashSteel11> Time to fulfill a life long dream of dying of dysentery
[2022-12-19 07:58:41] <@%BranLan> Judging by when it released, I'm gonna say most streamers didn't play it since it came out around when the new god of war and pokemon did. LUL
[2022-12-19 07:58:44] <$Zanoxis> oh...you got my hopes up
[2022-12-19 07:58:49] <$Zanoxis> i love henry cavill
[2022-12-19 07:58:59] <wzrdn> it would be fucking sick if it WAS voice acted though
[2022-12-19 07:59:10] <+usernameguy> huh, there's a trailer
[2022-12-19 07:59:12] <phillymilksteak> Who would you want to voice act it?
[2022-12-19 07:59:20] <%$GrumpSH> lime played oregan trail a few days on stream yeah
[2022-12-19 07:59:29] <%AnxietyPrime> @phillymilksteak Wayne June
[2022-12-19 07:59:34] <nightwisdom> Organ Trail already took that years ago
[2022-12-19 07:59:49] <$Zanoxis> to be fair, it came out with GoW and pokemon, it was sent out to die
[2022-12-19 08:00:16] <%+MrZev> lets do it!
[2022-12-19 08:00:21] <+Thrawn20> I watched gassymexican and cream play it. it was a fun time.
[2022-12-19 08:00:21] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 08:00:22] <$Zanoxis> id pay 30 for this....i never got to play the original
[2022-12-19 08:00:33] <%Heroic_Platypus> dude. let's go drown in a river
[2022-12-19 08:00:33] <%ABadTanker> its all time peak on steamcharts is 300 so thats probably why theres not much about it
[2022-12-19 08:00:40] <+radical_jack_> has amobile game feel, didn't liek it
[2022-12-19 08:00:48] <+Waaugh> is it by the same devs as the original?
[2022-12-19 08:00:59] <+Riptide_Rampage> its also mobile
[2022-12-19 08:01:17] <sosoFortress> that looks nice
[2022-12-19 08:01:25] <$Zanoxis> id love a remaster of Organ Trail next..
[2022-12-19 08:01:25] <+Riptide_Rampage> yea, I own the game on mobile, got it through apple's game service
[2022-12-19 08:01:28] <dingo2345> LUL
[2022-12-19 08:01:33] <$Zanoxis> if its mobile, i might just buy it
[2022-12-19 08:01:47] <The_Doktah> "chi chi" for short
[2022-12-19 08:01:50] <@%BranLan> how else you gonna see at night
[2022-12-19 08:01:50] <dingo2345> if it's mobile, its not a video game sorry
[2022-12-19 08:02:00] <+usernameguy> it's based on a game with line graphics
[2022-12-19 08:02:00] <+radical_jack_> industtrial era nvg brother
[2022-12-19 08:02:01] <%Heroic_Platypus> so you can see at night.... duh
[2022-12-19 08:02:01] <+Merc_The_Jerk> damn they got that NVG tech
[2022-12-19 08:02:09] <+Riptide_Rampage> the game is pretty mediocre imo
[2022-12-19 08:02:09] <wzrdn> general custer got them IR goggles
[2022-12-19 08:02:25] <%lord_vron> green and black is a call back to the first floppy game
[2022-12-19 08:02:28] <%+MrZev> i  dont see it on android
[2022-12-19 08:02:33] <%bdres> the hunting/rafting minigames being exactly the same as 30 years ago is kind of a turn off
[2022-12-19 08:02:33] <The_Doktah> @Merc_The_Jerk infrared cameras were common on the trail, unfortunately the technology was lost for hundreds of years
[2022-12-19 08:03:08] <@%BranLan> suddenly became worth 30 dollars
[2022-12-19 08:03:26] <$Zanoxis> we thinking this is just a nostalgia bomb then?
[2022-12-19 08:03:37] <@%BranLan> 100% nostalgia cash in
[2022-12-19 08:03:52] <+UmbrellaFox> You say that until you die of dysentary
[2022-12-19 08:03:56] <@%BranLan> I don't remember the original oregon trail being a good video game. LUL
[2022-12-19 08:04:09] <%bdres> I used to play oregon trail in the public library. they had a computer and you scheduled time on it with your library card
[2022-12-19 08:04:09] <+usernameguy> yeah that game feels ALL nostalgia
[2022-12-19 08:04:22] <The_Doktah> i've only ever heard of the old OT being frustrating, not fun
[2022-12-19 08:04:22] <+UmbrellaFox> A feel like a lot of the fun of playing Oregon Trail was not understanding it, so it felt random
[2022-12-19 08:04:29] <$Zanoxis> do you think a cyclops only has 1 testicle? @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-19 08:04:35] <+Riptide_Rampage> a lot of the game revolves around multiplayer community events which are basically just finding people to talk to along your journey and giving them stuff
[2022-12-19 08:04:36] <+bossdevildogg> Cyclops with so many eyes, I can’t see it flash
[2022-12-19 08:04:47] <wzrdn> the second version on CD was fucking sick smh
[2022-12-19 08:05:04] <%bdres> monkaS
[2022-12-19 08:05:21] <$Zanoxis> i always thought it would be funny if cyclops had 1 testicle and 2 dicks
[2022-12-19 08:05:28] <+bossdevildogg> What if he just needed some food
[2022-12-19 08:05:33] <+Riptide_Rampage> cyclops is fuckin outta there
[2022-12-19 08:05:55] <@%BranLan> cyclops prolly have 2 buttholes. gotta keep the number of holes the same.
[2022-12-19 08:06:00] <+bossdevildogg> Dicks a bully
[2022-12-19 08:06:01] <$Zanoxis> can you add it to the colony? just have a beafy body guard or worker on your side?
[2022-12-19 08:06:05] <LuckNut> The 18 year old warrior was very intimidating to the 270 yr old boi
[2022-12-19 08:06:13] <Bunsan> Squirrel kills 4 dwarfs. Cyclops just runs away and dies.
[2022-12-19 08:06:21] <wzrdn> 7900 kilos? he's 10 miles wide
[2022-12-19 08:06:22] <%bdres> yea the squirrels were way scarier
[2022-12-19 08:06:28] <dingo2345> @BranLan Cyclops only have one ball
[2022-12-19 08:06:31] <+UmbrellaFox> What are the current projects we're working on?
[2022-12-19 08:06:56] <+UmbrellaFox> Oh, I was here for that LUL
[2022-12-19 08:07:02] <+UmbrellaFox> The great Werelizard war
[2022-12-19 08:07:08] <+usernameguy> badass child though
[2022-12-19 08:07:14] <+UmbrellaFox> I just haven't seen any of today's stream
[2022-12-19 08:07:17] <$Zanoxis> and that child is still there isnt he?
[2022-12-19 08:07:24] <+UmbrellaFox> You betcha!
[2022-12-19 08:07:33] <+UmbrellaFox> Playing make believe
[2022-12-19 08:07:36] <$Zanoxis> is he playing on the stairs still
[2022-12-19 08:07:45] <+UmbrellaFox> No, he has his own little cavern
[2022-12-19 08:08:06] <$Zanoxis> do children grow up? cuz it seems like he should be grown by now
[2022-12-19 08:08:20] <+UmbrellaFox> I think turning into a werelizard stopped his aging
[2022-12-19 08:08:22] <+UmbrellaFox> idk tho
[2022-12-19 08:08:27] <%Heavy509> surround him with glass and make him a tourist attraction LUL
[2022-12-19 08:08:34] <$Zanoxis> that would be fucked. like vampires
[2022-12-19 08:08:42] <+UmbrellaFox> IRL if he was regenerating, it would actually stop his aging
[2022-12-19 08:09:08] <wzrdn> that's true IRL lizards are genetically eternal
[2022-12-19 08:09:29] <shazrobot> Yes
[2022-12-19 08:09:29] <$Zanoxis> i like that idea @Heavy509 like "beware the were lizard, kill them before you get bit or this will be you"
[2022-12-19 08:09:36] <@%BranLan> xmen was based on a true story probably.
[2022-12-19 08:09:36] <+UmbrellaFox> No, there was recently a research paper talking about how aging work
[2022-12-19 08:09:43] <%zinix5> absolutely
[2022-12-19 08:10:00] <+UmbrellaFox> and it's basically you're body not repairing as well, and different things attacking your cells over time
[2022-12-19 08:10:18] <+UmbrellaFox> But, yea.  Wolverine is actually a good frame of reference.  Or Doctor Who  :D
[2022-12-19 08:10:28] <$Zanoxis> this childs going to grow up and just start digging his way out to murder everyone
[2022-12-19 08:10:28] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 08:10:34] <%bdres> I cant wait for them to cure aging but only rich people get it
[2022-12-19 08:10:47] <+UmbrellaFox> So, vampires
[2022-12-19 08:11:17] <wzrdn> @bdres peter thiel tried it but he's still going to die don't worry
[2022-12-19 08:11:21] <$Zanoxis> isnt that what Underworld is about? (the 4th movie)
[2022-12-19 08:11:22] <+UmbrellaFox> :c  How did they ruin doctor who?
[2022-12-19 08:11:42] <$Zanoxis> all the vamps are rich and now out in the open, just living forever
[2022-12-19 08:11:47] <+UmbrellaFox> Yea, the showrunners changing hands is frustrating is fuck
[2022-12-19 08:12:12] <+UmbrellaFox> I wouldn't say noooooo impact
[2022-12-19 08:12:47] <$Zanoxis> my dad has watched every single episode of Dr.who.... at least twice. i dot get his love for it
[2022-12-19 08:12:48] <+UmbrellaFox> Especially newer doctors, some doctors create their next personality as a response to the previous one
[2022-12-19 08:12:54] <$Zanoxis> but to each his own right?
[2022-12-19 08:12:55] <blockington99> the impact is more in line with what the personality base he'll regenerate into next is
[2022-12-19 08:13:00] <+UmbrellaFox> ^
[2022-12-19 08:13:12] <+UmbrellaFox> David Tennant is amazing
[2022-12-19 08:13:15] <+UmbrellaFox> That's all I'll say
[2022-12-19 08:13:18] <wzrdn> ah yes, the fargate
[2022-12-19 08:13:18] <dingo2345> Goault?
[2022-12-19 08:13:24] <%bdres> stargate bad? im offended
[2022-12-19 08:13:27] <+UmbrellaFox> Love the other doctors too, but if you just watched his run, I wouldn't be mad
[2022-12-19 08:13:29] <+usernameguy> it's like you're trolling fanbases...
[2022-12-19 08:13:31] <CaptainCerealHands> Was Stargate that bad?
[2022-12-19 08:13:38] <ItsHooligan> i watched all of battlestar galatica
[2022-12-19 08:13:41] <$Zanoxis> i mean, i get it, but its a show spanning over 20 years, a newcomer would need to dedicate so much time to it
[2022-12-19 08:13:52] <CaptainCerealHands> I mean the series that came after it were trash but
[2022-12-19 08:13:52] <xix7xix> stargate was fun
[2022-12-19 08:13:56] <blockington99> the reason the new Who's were progressively younger and more whimsical for awhile was him trying to distract himself from the Time War
[2022-12-19 08:13:57] <$Zanoxis> my mom loves stargate...also never got that
[2022-12-19 08:13:59] <+UmbrellaFox> If you wanted to watch Old Who, then yea
[2022-12-19 08:14:01] <%bdres> hard to get ratings on scifi network
[2022-12-19 08:14:12] <thesweatybetty> Indeed
[2022-12-19 08:14:18] <+UmbrellaFox> But New Who was specifically created so you could start in New Who
[2022-12-19 08:14:23] <$Zanoxis> im into so much shit they are, but there are just some shows i cant get into
[2022-12-19 08:14:32] <Deleroth> didn't it start on showtime?
[2022-12-19 08:14:37] <wzrdn> scifi had the expanse which made everything else it ever did worth it
[2022-12-19 08:14:40] <%bdres> battlestar galactica was one of the best scifi shows ever imo and scifi was the only network that would run it
[2022-12-19 08:14:45] <%bdres> they did exapnse too
[2022-12-19 08:14:51] <$Zanoxis> peak scyfi channel shows: Warehouse 13 and Haven
[2022-12-19 08:14:58] <%bdres> nbc did the bsg miniseries, yea
[2022-12-19 08:15:26] <%bdres> oh, stargate, yeah. the movie was fucking weird
[2022-12-19 08:15:33] <%$mord_> Stargate was a real movie
[2022-12-19 08:15:41] <wzrdn> the expanse is over now
[2022-12-19 08:15:44] <%+MrZev> expanse is over for now
[2022-12-19 08:15:49] <+mr6re3n> no
[2022-12-19 08:15:49] <%bdres> scifi network dropped expanse and amazon picked it up
[2022-12-19 08:15:57] <%+MrZev> there are more books but it takes place like 400 years later
[2022-12-19 08:16:01] <wzrdn> they did the first 2 seasons? I think???
[2022-12-19 08:16:12] <%bdres> amazon is running a new stargate too, i think
[2022-12-19 08:16:18] <+mr6re3n> It was too expensive
[2022-12-19 08:16:40] <xix7xix> dont amazon just pick up warhammer ?
[2022-12-19 08:16:40] <ItsHooligan> i always hear people upset firefly got cancled but ive never seen it
[2022-12-19 08:16:45] <wzrdn> I hate everything but the expanse was so good
[2022-12-19 08:16:52] <$Zanoxis> my dad also liked firefly
[2022-12-19 08:16:53] <%$Weeeluu> firefly was good imo
[2022-12-19 08:17:00] <The_Doktah> expanse was very good but i don't think i'd watch if they brought it back
[2022-12-19 08:17:09] <%bdres> its crazy how much money amazon and netflix can dump into projects
[2022-12-19 08:17:14] <%bdres> and hbo too
[2022-12-19 08:17:15] <dingo2345> remember the episode where O'neal turned neandertal on the neandertal planet? LUL
[2022-12-19 08:17:20] <shazrobot> 1 billion+ seasons now only
[2022-12-19 08:17:28] <wzrdn> there's a rumor they're gonna make an Amos spinoff, which I would at least give a chance
[2022-12-19 08:17:43] <$Zanoxis> its sad, but people are focusing so much on CGI, but it still doesnt look or feel as good as proper makeup or props
[2022-12-19 08:17:53] <%lord_vron> Honestly Firefly was not bad but I think it got over hyped due to it getting dropped more then it being a great show
[2022-12-19 08:17:59] <The_Doktah> @wzrdn sounds like joey tribbiani material
[2022-12-19 08:18:07] <ItsHooligan> I want more godzilla movies I saw Shin Godzilla and yesterday and loved it
[2022-12-19 08:18:22] <ItsHooligan> extra and snuck in
[2022-12-19 08:18:27] <wzrdn> @The_Doktah lol
[2022-12-19 08:19:09] <ItsHooligan> shin godzilla was very different I had a hard time with the other ones
[2022-12-19 08:19:10] <The_Doktah> amos is a great supporting character but i do not want to watch 40+ minutes of him at a time
[2022-12-19 08:19:14] <$Zanoxis> ya know what i want? unique good movies...no more sequals, requals, reimaginings, or remakes. lets have some unique shit come out
[2022-12-19 08:19:33] <+bossdevildogg> There goes Tokyo. Go go Godzilla
[2022-12-19 08:20:07] <%$mord_> Expanse was financed and produced by another company and Syfy's deal was garabge, they only made money from the first run of the episodes and nothing from streaming
[2022-12-19 08:20:10] <$Zanoxis> speaking of shit movies....im excited to see Legend of the White Dragon next year
[2022-12-19 08:20:22] <The_Doktah> @Zanoxis people still make unique things and nobody buys it because it's not something they know already
[2022-12-19 08:20:25] <wzrdn> I get your point. I hope they would have a lot more going on than just him but I completely understand how it could be bad.
[2022-12-19 08:20:58] <%bdres> people always say they want original shit but when original shit comes out, they dont fuck with it
[2022-12-19 08:20:58] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 08:21:52] <$Zanoxis> its a balancing act. come out with something unique, but make it look appealing. imo theres just a lot of bad marketing in movies
[2022-12-19 08:22:17] <$Zanoxis> trailers just show either way too much, or nothing at all
[2022-12-19 08:22:26] <ItsHooligan> I want movies that break away from "the heros quest" formula
[2022-12-19 08:22:46] <wzrdn> they did once, but nevermore
[2022-12-19 08:23:01] <$Zanoxis> unfortunately "the heroes quest" is a tride and true formula that has worked since before the Odyssey
[2022-12-19 08:23:05] <%bdres> big studios just wanna spew out lowest common denominator stuff, so its always heroes quest
[2022-12-19 08:23:14] <shazrobot> there's cool stuff coming out all the time. just aren't $100 million dollar box office sellers. Reason To Leave is an awesome Korean movie that just came out for the example.
[2022-12-19 08:23:14] <%bdres> thats what hits the most demos
[2022-12-19 08:23:40] <$Zanoxis> its a money game for big hollywood. make something as cheap as possible, throw some big names in there, and hope it makes a profit
[2022-12-19 08:23:52] <$Zanoxis> rather than take the time and care to make something great
[2022-12-19 08:24:21] <$Zanoxis> games have the same issue
[2022-12-19 08:24:41] <%bdres> all the best games are indie games these days
[2022-12-19 08:24:44] <$Zanoxis> thats why indie games are so important, showing true passion
[2022-12-19 08:24:45] <%bdres> AAA games are for normies
[2022-12-19 08:24:51] <$Zanoxis> said it just before me
[2022-12-19 08:25:24] <ItsHooligan> @Zanoxis everyonce in a while tho you get an Elden Ring
[2022-12-19 08:25:28] <$Zanoxis> idk though, cant say that bout all AAA games. I loved Gow, Horizon, and ofc any final fantasy goodness
[2022-12-19 08:25:28] <Blas88> probably a waterfall victim again
[2022-12-19 08:25:38] <The_Doktah> yeah like that one indie game that came out and shook everyone's world. what was it called, sheldon's rings? that was an indie gem.
[2022-12-19 08:25:49] <wzrdn> bazinga
[2022-12-19 08:26:00] <$Zanoxis> im excited for Hades 2...i love that studio
[2022-12-19 08:26:23] <$Zanoxis> i never played hades 1, but ill prolly do it someday when its on sale and i got cash lol
[2022-12-19 08:26:32] <%bdres> I'm excited for the next dwarf fortress patch that fixes everything and improves performance 4Head
[2022-12-19 08:26:57] <wzrdn> I'm excited for the dwarf fortress DLC with voice acting by henry cavill
[2022-12-19 08:27:18] <wzrdn> and snoop dog
[2022-12-19 08:27:23] <ZeroDjinn> and his netflix series
[2022-12-19 08:27:31] <%bdres> snoop dog voicing the elves is gonna be wild
[2022-12-19 08:27:42] <$Zanoxis> ima be honest, im really excited for the new year cuz my neighbors are behind on rent and will probably be kicked out, which means my partner and I can move out of the In-laws house
[2022-12-19 08:27:56] <%bdres> lmao wtf
[2022-12-19 08:28:07] <$Zanoxis> i know, its terrible
[2022-12-19 08:28:10] <%bdres> what a sentence to type
[2022-12-19 08:28:12] <The_Doktah> that's fucked up
[2022-12-19 08:28:17] <The_Doktah> congrats, tho
[2022-12-19 08:28:24] <The_Doktah> but also really fucked up
[2022-12-19 08:28:41] <$Zanoxis> its fucked up, but they are only aquantences of mine...unlike my partner, whos known them all her life lol
[2022-12-19 08:29:03] <$Zanoxis> its super fucked...but where else am i gonna get a place for as cheap as we'd get that one
[2022-12-19 08:29:28] <wzrdn> don't worry I'm sure hedge funds are going to release their grip on the housing market any day now
[2022-12-19 08:29:29] <$Zanoxis> also, they both have good jobs and treat the whole house like shit. its a hoarders dream in there
[2022-12-19 08:29:40] <The_Doktah> "hey guys no offense but i hope you get evicted so i can have your house, here's a casserole btw"
[2022-12-19 08:29:45] <%bdres> not good enough jobs to afford rent apparently
[2022-12-19 08:30:09] <$Zanoxis> the rent is like 700, the landlord is cool like that
[2022-12-19 08:30:22] <ItsHooligan> no dude I understand theres a house behind mine that has its own lake with a dock, when the zombies happen...ya know....if its unoccupied it wouldnt be so bad
[2022-12-19 08:30:25] <$Zanoxis> they make like 5x what me, my partner, and her mom do combined
[2022-12-19 08:30:28] <%bdres> 700 for rent? is it 2004 in there?
[2022-12-19 08:31:00] <$Zanoxis> the landlord doesnt care about the money, hes retired and just does this as a hobby
[2022-12-19 08:31:00] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 08:31:38] <$Zanoxis> hes been my mother-in-laws landlord for 16 years and has never raised rent
[2022-12-19 08:31:39] <wzrdn> what do werelizards believe in
[2022-12-19 08:31:58] <The_Doktah> werejesus
[2022-12-19 08:32:16] <The_Doktah> he rose from the dead after 3 days and then mauled werejudas to death
[2022-12-19 08:32:25] <$Zanoxis> you are less terrible for what you said then me @ItsHooligan lol but same vein
[2022-12-19 08:32:25] <wzrdn> haha
[2022-12-19 08:32:38] <$Zanoxis> i just needed to get that shit off my chest, been thinking bout it for 2 months
[2022-12-19 08:33:20] <+Seriack> Is that werejesus, as in a Jesus that bites others to make more werejesus', or a Jesus that was a wereanimal?
[2022-12-19 08:33:38] <$Zanoxis> prolly the later seriack
[2022-12-19 08:33:46] <ItsHooligan> @Seriack yes
[2022-12-19 08:33:57] <$Zanoxis> kinda defeats his whole thing if he made other people jesus
[2022-12-19 08:34:00] <The_Doktah> dunno man, the scriptures don't say what happens if you get bitten by werejesus and live
[2022-12-19 08:34:09] <Blas88> @Zanoxis will you invite your neighbors to the housewarming party?
[2022-12-19 08:34:12] <The_Doktah> maybe that's how you get to heaven
[2022-12-19 08:34:28] <$Zanoxis> that would be fucked blas88, no no no
[2022-12-19 08:34:43] <$Zanoxis> im an asshole, but im not THAT much of one
[2022-12-19 08:35:45] <$Zanoxis> has anyone here made venison gumbo? just wondering how it would taste
[2022-12-19 08:36:09] <$Zanoxis> the meat would prolly become tender if left in a crockpot for 8 hours yeah?
[2022-12-19 08:36:15] <Viperbmf> tastes like gumbo, but with deer in it
[2022-12-19 08:36:40] <Viperbmf> used to get a ton of venisen from local places years ago
[2022-12-19 08:37:04] <Viperbmf> even had hamburger helper but with venison
[2022-12-19 08:37:21] <$Zanoxis> that seems interesting
[2022-12-19 08:37:35] <Viperbmf> meat is just a bit stronger in flavor
[2022-12-19 08:37:41] <$Zanoxis> its been like 13 years since i had deer jerky, and thats my only exp with venison
[2022-12-19 08:38:19] <$Zanoxis> closest thing was a rabbit stew i made. this butchery had rare meats sometimes
[2022-12-19 08:38:50] <Viperbmf> my step mom made all kinds of random stuff wtih venison, gumbo, goulashes, stews
[2022-12-19 08:38:55] <Viperbmf> burgers
[2022-12-19 08:39:19] <wzrdn> gumbo is good, venison however is not
[2022-12-19 08:39:30] <+usernameguy> broth of a bunch of random shit with spices. it's good.
[2022-12-19 08:39:30] <Viperbmf> tbh honest i dont know all the ingredianits either, just gumbo is usually on the spicy sude
[2022-12-19 08:39:31] <$Zanoxis> youve never had gumbo? DIck if you ever come to nevada, ill make you some to try
[2022-12-19 08:39:37] <Viperbmf> side*
[2022-12-19 08:39:38] <wzrdn> unless you like cracking your teeth on buckshot
[2022-12-19 08:40:01] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Pretty sure gumbo is that green clay character with the horse Kappa
[2022-12-19 08:40:06] <!%Calastigro> @Zanoxis how's the fishing in nevada?
[2022-12-19 08:40:17] <$Zanoxis> i speciffically make whats called Jean Leffeat, and its a mix of Bumblebee stew, and Voodoo chicken
[2022-12-19 08:40:35] <ItsHooligan> bumblebee stew?
[2022-12-19 08:40:39] <$Zanoxis> @Calastigro i wouldnt know, i dont fish lol
[2022-12-19 08:40:39] <wzrdn> arise chicken, chicken, arise
[2022-12-19 08:40:45] <The_Doktah> i too enjoy eating bees. i prefer them raw, or sun-dried.
[2022-12-19 08:41:26] <$Zanoxis> bumblebee stew is a stew made with corn and lots of other stuff. the bumblee bee is cuz it has corn and black beans in it
[2022-12-19 08:41:26] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-19 08:41:32] <ItsHooligan> @Calastigro i hear its good up in flagstaff but otherwise nevada is pretty much desert
[2022-12-19 08:41:46] <$Zanoxis> its good in taho, from what ive heard
[2022-12-19 08:41:52] <The_Doktah> @Zanoxis sounds like false advertising
[2022-12-19 08:42:00] <ItsHooligan> wait flagstaf is arizone nvm
[2022-12-19 08:42:00] <!%Calastigro> oh yeah, lake tahoe has fishes
[2022-12-19 08:42:11] <Maki_Rollz> I just moved to Nevada, but Tahoe and Pyramid lake are what ive heard for fishing
[2022-12-19 08:42:18] <!%Calastigro> trying to think how you'd get dick to nevada, lol
[2022-12-19 08:42:36] <Viperbmf> feels bad for the left mitten
[2022-12-19 08:42:45] <Viperbmf> never going to be as good as their brother
[2022-12-19 08:42:52] <The_Doktah> i hear planes are good for getting places
[2022-12-19 08:42:56] <$Zanoxis> its not, i promise. theres a really good chain restaurant through the midwest called J Gumbos, its where i got the recipe
[2022-12-19 08:43:01] <+nilockin> I feel like this isn't proper dwarf fortress if it doesn't make my eyes bleed
[2022-12-19 08:43:03] <wzrdn> there are no airports in nevada though
[2022-12-19 08:43:05] <jonflip_zoosa> the right mitten is where the power stones go
[2022-12-19 08:43:22] <ItsHooligan> @wzrdn really?
[2022-12-19 08:43:23] <$Zanoxis> theres an airport in reno
[2022-12-19 08:43:29] <$Zanoxis> its not all desert
[2022-12-19 08:43:31] <Maki_Rollz> Reno and Vegas are the only places you would wanna go anyways and they have airports
[2022-12-19 08:43:49] <wzrdn> why would you ever believe any state doesn't have an airport chat
[2022-12-19 08:43:55] <$Zanoxis> ive only been here 2 years and im always shocked by how much of the desert i actually see
[2022-12-19 08:44:10] <Schlurpus> how are the bugs in this game? are they sill loving the caves and luxurious halls of your kingdom? :)
[2022-12-19 08:44:27] <The_Doktah> of course there's airports, what do you think it is, alaska?
[2022-12-19 08:44:32] <Maki_Rollz> lmao
[2022-12-19 08:44:33] <$Zanoxis> ^
[2022-12-19 08:44:38] <%$Weeeluu> there are a lot of tiny airports springled through NV. but reno and vegas is biggest
[2022-12-19 08:44:39] <ItsHooligan> idk i thought maybe they all got pandemic shutdown or something
[2022-12-19 08:44:53] <ItsHooligan> im gullible
[2022-12-19 08:45:01] <Viperbmf> alot of crash to destop bugs
[2022-12-19 08:45:09] <$Zanoxis> Dick, if you came to reno, i could show you some really good food
[2022-12-19 08:45:10] <Schlurpus> yeah tried a "clever" rimwolrd reference! LUL
[2022-12-19 08:45:12] <Viperbmf> noticed it has to do with double clicking things, at least for me
[2022-12-19 08:45:18] <$Zanoxis> no canned venison i promise
[2022-12-19 08:46:10] <$Zanoxis> i love showing people tahoe...its beautiful

[2022-12-19 08:47:53] <Maki_Rollz> I had to pass through Fresno a couple months ago... I hate that part of cali lol
[2022-12-19 08:48:25] <Schlurpus> as a german guy, these distances in the USA are just insanity LUL
[2022-12-19 08:48:29] <$Zanoxis> the only bit of cali ive been to is Sacremento, that was okay but i wouldnt wanna live there
[2022-12-19 08:48:57] <%bdres> sacramento isn't exactly a hot spot
[2022-12-19 08:49:09] <Maki_Rollz> I moved to Reno from Virginia, and it took 5 days driving
[2022-12-19 08:49:09] <wzrdn> hahahaha
[2022-12-19 08:49:24] <wzrdn> "I'll take a bus or a train surely" hahahaha
[2022-12-19 08:49:28] <$Zanoxis> im sorry, im high, it was 36 hours, not 72
[2022-12-19 08:49:35] <Viperbmf> alot of Europeans dont realize our states are the same size are their countries
[2022-12-19 08:49:43] <$Zanoxis> i remembered a 3 and thought it was for the day
[2022-12-19 08:50:04] <$Zanoxis> and its cuz me and my mom had to rest
[2022-12-19 08:50:11] <$Zanoxis> cuz we tried taking turns
[2022-12-19 08:50:21] <wzrdn> the northern route from cali to the midwest is beautiful though
[2022-12-19 08:50:30] <%bdres> i love cali. born in ny, raised in ct, college and life in ma, but now im in cali and doubt ill ever leave

[2022-12-19 08:52:01] <Maki_Rollz> its super boring lmao
[2022-12-19 08:52:17] <$Zanoxis> worst part of my move was when me and my mom got to a gas station and she locked the keys in the car
[2022-12-19 08:52:35] <wzrdn> you haven't been to arkansas have you lol
[2022-12-19 08:52:43] <$Zanoxis> we spent 2 hours in the freezing cold trying to get a slimjim to work
[2022-12-19 08:52:50] <$Zanoxis> we got it eventually
[2022-12-19 08:52:56] <!%Calastigro> i think the border between nevada and utah is funny, so much sin business in these tiny nevada border towns
[2022-12-19 08:52:59] <Schlurpus> do all cars in the US have cruise control or are people actually haldling the car for so many hours? seems tedious
[2022-12-19 08:53:01] <Maki_Rollz> having done bothj, the southern route is prettier imo
[2022-12-19 08:53:08] <%zinix5> lived in both utah and Nebraska and can confirm
[2022-12-19 08:53:10] <%+Impuritan> Evening rich and chat
[2022-12-19 08:53:19] <Viperbmf> luckily for missouri, you can just take the one highway through the entire state east-west
[2022-12-19 08:53:50] <Viperbmf> get off that highiway though and the roads go all over the damn places
[2022-12-19 08:53:55] <RoboTiio> yeah Utah is surprisingly nice. even the dry southern part is cool too
[2022-12-19 08:53:56] <wzrdn> utah wyoming is great
[2022-12-19 08:53:56] <+Outrider> As someone in utah it's beautiful here but get me out
[2022-12-19 08:53:58] <!%Calastigro> Moab down in southern utah, too
[2022-12-19 08:54:04] <$Zanoxis> i thought about moving to utah...but im happy in NV
[2022-12-19 08:54:16] <%zinix5> I live in slc right now and its so beautiful
[2022-12-19 08:54:18] <+Outrider> Sugarhouse is super hipster and wonderful
[2022-12-19 08:54:53] <wzrdn> a state can be beautiful but horrible to live in culturally
[2022-12-19 08:54:55] <%zinix5> yes and that why I live there outrider haha
[2022-12-19 08:55:17] <wzrdn> haha
[2022-12-19 08:55:23] <+Outrider> I miss living there a bit, it was nice
[2022-12-19 08:55:23] <ItsHooligan> yep
[2022-12-19 08:55:28] <ItsHooligan> food sucks
[2022-12-19 08:55:29] <$Zanoxis> i spent this whole time chatting and now i got like 10 minutes to do all the things i said id do before my partner got home. back to the lurk
[2022-12-19 08:55:35] <%+davidflowers90> I do 95% of my driving at night when traveling
[2022-12-19 08:56:11] <The_Doktah> a divorce would really throw a wrench into the whole house-stealing plan
[2022-12-19 08:57:28] <The_Doktah> i get sleepy just driving 30 minutes to work
[2022-12-19 08:57:41] <The_Doktah> monotonous activity
[2022-12-19 08:58:38] <+Frosty_Virago> New fort? Any particular theme or ideas in mind?
[2022-12-19 08:58:56] <The_Doktah> theme is "as many people as possible"
[2022-12-19 08:59:09] <The_Doktah> very similar to all of dick's other themes

[2022-12-19 09:03:24] <malfiory> !please
[2022-12-19 09:03:24] <@^Moobot> @malfiory Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-19 09:03:57] <The_Doktah> @tipereth6 if you don't get out of the shower looking like a 1920s miner, are you even really clean
[2022-12-19 09:04:28] <H2o_Spez> magma uses when you smelt?
[2022-12-19 09:05:31] <H2o_Spez> i mean like source.  is block get used or its just for heat?
[2022-12-19 09:05:35] <%bdres> can I suggest a possible fps improvement?
[2022-12-19 09:06:15] <%bdres> it relate to a game mechanic so im not sure
[2022-12-19 09:06:16] <+radical_jack_> no it just keeps it as it, you can have one magma and it heat indef
[2022-12-19 09:06:42] <%GoRibGo> what monster attacked you?
[2022-12-19 09:06:44] <%+Usinji> So you captured a cave troll. Was that a tamable creature? If not, how did you move it? I got some trogo's caged and not sure what to do with them lol.
[2022-12-19 09:07:00] <%GoRibGo> OH good
[2022-12-19 09:07:09] <+Frosty_Virago> Hopefully the game gets some updates to help with some lag.
[2022-12-19 09:07:28] <H2o_Spez> how you sell them? my dude when ever bring cage its remove animal from it
[2022-12-19 09:07:34] <%GoRibGo> ...where are you keeping the werelizard
[2022-12-19 09:07:36] <%bdres> @Frosty_Virago youre gonna be waiting a long time
[2022-12-19 09:07:45] <+Frosty_Virago> I'm certain
[2022-12-19 09:07:57] <%+Usinji> Ok cool so I guess they'll come move them when I sell them. Relocating them was my issue
[2022-12-19 09:08:24] <%GoRibGo> I didn't think of that when I got murdered by wereapes slowly through spreading
[2022-12-19 09:08:35] <RoboTiio> Why is one my children tantrum punching a python. Don't do that, lil dude.
[2022-12-19 09:09:31] <%GoRibGo> Do you know how to fix a stairs going down, and the next floor its also going down, when I want them to connect?
[2022-12-19 09:10:05] <H2o_Spez> i forgot to turn off auto collect. i had 3k webs xD
[2022-12-19 09:10:31] <Tsarok> how many webs does it take to create the internet?
[2022-12-19 09:10:46] <%bdres> the internet is a series of tubes. not webs
[2022-12-19 09:10:53] <Tsarok> You right
[2022-12-19 09:11:05] <RoboTiio> use a Stair Construction if you can't mine out the stairs @GoRibGo
[2022-12-19 09:11:39] <H2o_Spez> why its so cold !
[2022-12-19 09:11:44] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 09:11:44] <%GoRibGo> it says space already occupied, with stairs just going down, not up and down
[2022-12-19 09:12:01] <%GoRibGo> I'm probably being dumb but its stumped me
[2022-12-19 09:12:05] <RoboTiio> If you have a Down Stair Construction then you need to remove that Construction, then rebuild as an Up/Down
[2022-12-19 09:12:36] <%GoRibGo> hmm I'll try again
[2022-12-19 09:13:17] <RoboTiio> if its already a Built Stair you might have to Remove Construction. (hotkey m -> x)
[2022-12-19 09:14:14] <%bdres> the water is splooging again
[2022-12-19 09:16:46] <%GoRibGo> @RoboTiio removing them isnt working
[2022-12-19 09:19:14] <%bdres> they cant build vertically if thats what you're trying @GoRibGo
[2022-12-19 09:20:13] <%GoRibGo> yeeah its hard to describe too, its pretty minor but its really bugging me
[2022-12-19 09:20:36] <%GoRibGo> when I set a build stairs over the existing stairs the bp appears but it doesnt ever get done
[2022-12-19 09:20:50] <%bdres> stairs are really confusing for a while
[2022-12-19 09:20:56] <%GoRibGo> right? its like I can't continue until I figure this out haha
[2022-12-19 09:21:53] <%bdres> when in doubt, just slam another stairhole

[2022-12-19 09:22:15] <%bdres> what danger monkaS
[2022-12-19 09:22:39] <+Seriack> Probably rumors, unfounded of course, of the werelizard child somewhere in the fort.
[2022-12-19 09:22:45] <%GoRibGo> gonna have to do that I think, it looks like I can make a hole by mining a channel but then theres a hole there lol
[2022-12-19 09:23:05] <%bdres> wtf are those rodent men
[2022-12-19 09:24:12] <%bdres> good ol' poverty conscription. just dont tell them the government doesn't hav emoney
[2022-12-19 09:24:25] <%GoRibGo> got the bodies to spare now
[2022-12-19 09:24:42] <AC_ThirtySix> which biome is this
[2022-12-19 09:25:33] <%GoRibGo> I have another question, can you fix everyone being angry constantly? 2 years after a big corpse clean up and ghost haunting and they never were happy again lol
[2022-12-19 09:26:21] <%bdres> you can look at them and see what they're unhappy about
[2022-12-19 09:26:25] <%bdres> sometimes that helps
[2022-12-19 09:26:31] <+Seriack> They love feeling the mist in their beards. NODDERS
[2022-12-19 09:26:47] <%GoRibGo> lol I did not try that, I did do a lot of other stuff like engraving and nice stuff, but they were forever haunted by bad memories. All their current thoughts were positive
[2022-12-19 09:27:59] <+kallman1206> Clothesmaking
[2022-12-19 09:28:03] <+kallman1206> in purple
[2022-12-19 09:28:23] <%bdres> I love how menus just arent alphabetical ever
[2022-12-19 09:29:10] <+Seriack> Maybe it's alphabetical in the world it's created in. Kappa
[2022-12-19 09:29:45] <%bdres> I didnt realize climbing was a thing until I saw a dwarf jump 2 z-levels to punch a goblin to death
[2022-12-19 09:30:33] <r3nko_> Adequate sounds like a 4/10
[2022-12-19 09:30:44] <RoboTiio> check out cat's skills. they're all Legendary Climbers LUL
[2022-12-19 09:30:49] <%tipereth6> thats almost a surgeon
[2022-12-19 09:31:47] <%+Usinji> The one thing I want in this game is a combat window setup kinda like pokemon lol. Where I can see the sprites fighting. Minimal animations along with the text. Would be sick.
[2022-12-19 09:31:56] <%bdres> theres a cleaning job if you want a janitor

[2022-12-19 09:37:02] <!%Ellieanna> only 1 cutter?
[2022-12-19 09:37:24] <!%+krainboltgreene> It's day one of vacation and I'm already restless.
[2022-12-19 09:37:46] <%bdres> I dont get why it makes you manually add each work detail
[2022-12-19 09:37:56] <%bdres> like, why cant they just be there
[2022-12-19 09:38:30] <AchillesLastStand> @bdres The honest answer to that question is probably "The devs didn't know how to"
[2022-12-19 09:39:02] <%bdres> @AchillesLastStand they knew how to add the 8 default ones lol
[2022-12-19 09:39:25] <%+Usinji> I will say if you just let everyone do shit the system actaully does alright.  So I like that aspect.
[2022-12-19 09:40:03] <%+Usinji> Fair point lol
[2022-12-19 09:40:14] <%bdres> i wonder what legendary cheese tastes like
[2022-12-19 09:40:16] <H2o_Spez> its normal that my dude stands inmagma and drowning? but not melting NotLikeThis
[2022-12-19 09:40:27] <+radical_jack_> yeah eagerly awaiting df hack and the like to come to this
[2022-12-19 09:40:28] <%+Usinji> I kinda tend to set the guys I want on the important stuff and let her run
[2022-12-19 09:40:46] <+detoast> like pepperjack eh?
[2022-12-19 09:41:11] <!%+krainboltgreene> Munster is the best cheese though.
[2022-12-19 09:41:38] <%bdres> ghost pepper pepperjack is where its at
[2022-12-19 09:41:48] <Viperbmf> we know, we alllll know

[2022-12-19 09:43:08] <%bdres> you've heard of the techno viking? now we got techno dwarves
[2022-12-19 09:45:30] <!%Calastigro> i wonder how techno viking is doing these days
[2022-12-19 09:45:46] <!%Calastigro> i check on Mr Cool Ice every few years, make sure he's doing well
[2022-12-19 09:50:12] <!%+krainboltgreene> :|
[2022-12-19 09:50:23] <Trisgrand> how do you move animals to pens I created a stockpile and selected animals but they arent moving
[2022-12-19 09:50:57] <$Oolert> you dirty bitch
[2022-12-19 09:51:34] <Trisgrand> just not moving. they are the animals i started with im assuming they are pets
[2022-12-19 09:51:40] <%$DuranDuranDuran> So Techno Viking is off the sauce and as of 2015 looks like a normal guy with an IT job.
[2022-12-19 09:51:41] <Trisgrand> ill work it out
[2022-12-19 09:52:15] <!%+krainboltgreene> Seriously?!
[2022-12-19 09:52:20] <+BinaryFireball> you should be old enough to remember techno viking
[2022-12-19 09:52:20] <skurke_> old meme
[2022-12-19 09:52:20] <r3nko_> Wait you don't know Technoviking?
[2022-12-19 09:52:23] <!%Calastigro> techno viking is a guy who was at the front of a parade
[2022-12-19 09:52:27] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Its a meme from like 2001.
[2022-12-19 09:52:27] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-19 09:52:29] <%bdres> one of the OG memes
[2022-12-19 09:52:31] <%+Usinji> @Trisgrand You're just wanting to paster/pen them? because you need a zone for that not a stockpile
[2022-12-19 09:52:44] <!%Calastigro> it's a video
[2022-12-19 09:52:51] <+BinaryFireball> its just a buff dude at a parade doing his thing
[2022-12-19 09:52:51] <skurke_> it's but a man
[2022-12-19 09:52:52] <%bdres> its not just a man. its a viking
[2022-12-19 09:52:53] <!%+krainboltgreene> It's a video of a man dancing to a song.
[2022-12-19 09:52:54] <$hexdecs> its an OG meme
[2022-12-19 09:52:54] <%AnxietyPrime> yeah it's a guy who walked in a parade having a good time
[2022-12-19 09:53:09] <!%+krainboltgreene> It was the 00's idea of a viking.
[2022-12-19 09:53:24] <Trisgrand> @Trisgrand I see, thanks man.
[2022-12-19 09:53:27] <%tipereth6> Its a super old meme, I didnt even have the word meme in vocab when I first saw that
[2022-12-19 09:53:31] <%AnxietyPrime> I get called techno viking all the time because I a) have a beard and b) dance a lot
[2022-12-19 09:53:43] <skurke_> back then the meme economy was something different
[2022-12-19 09:54:33] <cfpreston> i mean, at least cripple bottom is dorf related
[2022-12-19 09:54:35] <!%Calastigro> @BinaryFireball it's like he'd never seen that fuckin' badger badger badger mushroom shit
[2022-12-19 09:54:43] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Its a meme for 50-year-old men. You just missed it.

[2022-12-19 09:57:43] <%bdres> its such trash
[2022-12-19 09:57:53] <!%+krainboltgreene> YTMND and Albino Black Sheep were like what if subreddits were entire websites.

[2022-12-19 12:32:10] <Kumikurre> 8000 for a mussel roast wtf :D
[2022-12-19 12:32:13] <Ironstates> buy the slave!
[2022-12-19 12:32:26] <%hottiefruits> maybe you interrupted some kinky fun times
[2022-12-19 12:32:40] <monkeryz> Is the lizard child long gone? Or can they also somehow go in a cage?
[2022-12-19 12:33:17] <+k_nord> maybe forced inside by the water accident?
[2022-12-19 12:33:52] <%$kuakae> did one of the animals overwhelm him, lock him up, put on a dwarf costume and is now living amongst you?
[2022-12-19 12:34:06] <smilingowl> they can trip the traps sometime? may stepped into one of the cage traps
[2022-12-19 12:36:12] <MasterMonk84> How do you compare the new DF with Rimworld?

[2022-12-19 12:36:35] <duchko> Pulp fiction vibes
[2022-12-19 12:38:43] <Glaciace> maybe he just really likes being in a cage
[2022-12-19 12:38:57] <Pompolonius> That's a wooden cage. I bet she built herself into it!
[2022-12-19 12:39:11] <smilingowl> they come over to release him and he politly declines
[2022-12-19 12:39:43] <%+Usinji> Man it would be sick if you could tie children to chains. Have them "play make believe" while guarding the entrance. pvpKing
[2022-12-19 12:41:34] <+ChromeViper> Stare
[2022-12-19 12:42:05] <rainasu> lmao dwarf cage
[2022-12-19 12:42:14] <rainasu> lever
[2022-12-19 12:42:22] <%hottiefruits> are they a criminal?
[2022-12-19 12:42:28] <%+Usinji> Haha can you pen/pasture him
[2022-12-19 12:42:41] <Pompolonius> I hope they end up putting the animal in without taking the dwarf out. LUL
[2022-12-19 12:42:57] <%+Usinji> Let him out for a little grazing time
[2022-12-19 12:43:03] <rainasu> tame him :)
[2022-12-19 12:44:10] <+k_nord> that some nice master crafter mussel roast
[2022-12-19 12:44:12] <rainasu> appraiser had a bit too much mushroom wine :)
[2022-12-19 12:44:13] <Pompolonius> Why are you hating on raw mussel roast?
[2022-12-19 12:44:47] <OneViolentGentleman> well, food in fancy restaurants be like that :p
[2022-12-19 12:44:51] <TeeJabs> your broker is just like....way into seafood :P
[2022-12-19 12:45:14] <Pompolonius> I don't trust your food judgements.
[2022-12-19 12:45:25] <smilingowl> fishing op
[2022-12-19 12:45:46] <%+Usinji> Is your broker legendary? Or maybe the cook is just a badass
[2022-12-19 12:45:51] <Iqunlimited> prepared food being worth a lot is a long standing thing lol
[2022-12-19 12:46:25] <%hottiefruits> put some mussel roasts on a pedestal in there?

[2022-12-19 12:47:23] <%hottiefruits> it sounds dumb so it must be a good idea
[2022-12-19 12:47:49] <%Convectt> bury? ppl still dying by going outside?
[2022-12-19 12:48:38] <Iqunlimited> that is incredible tbh
[2022-12-19 12:48:44] [Notification] thexLed subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months!
[2022-12-19 12:48:46] <Iqunlimited> i wonder if hungry dwarves will come by and take one for nibbling
[2022-12-19 12:49:00] <%Convectt> a public viewing of the fermentation process
[2022-12-19 12:49:05] <%+Usinji> Or if it'll rot lol
[2022-12-19 12:50:22] <%Convectt> it sounds good, but it is probably becuase it has "cheese" in it
[2022-12-19 12:50:33] <%+Felstrike> What happened in the last 6 hours I went to bed
[2022-12-19 12:51:25] <rainasu> no soap?
[2022-12-19 12:51:26] <%+Usinji> So the food being worth so much is just the logical outcome of having a legendary cheesemaker.
[2022-12-19 12:51:39] <Bananaheli> Hello, so good to catch a stream again.
[2022-12-19 12:52:25] <Bananaheli> Working on my PhD and need some chill vibes :D
[2022-12-19 12:53:29] <%hottiefruits> yeah to be fair the roasts you sold were masterworks
[2022-12-19 12:53:32] <rainasu> if you assign an item to a noble you can see values, idk about barrels/bins tho
[2022-12-19 12:55:16] <%thexLed> isn't it time for their Christmas brake soon?
