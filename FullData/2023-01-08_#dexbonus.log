[2023-01-08 14:35:32] <%+The_Dawnseeker> they take glass in recycling down in plymotuh but I've always thought it weird, if any glass thing breaks you've contaminated all that plastic and paper with broken glass, nightmare for sorting

[2023-01-08 14:36:44] <altie1> I'd love for packages to be small family friendly. I'd like to buy two-three hot dogs. Not 6-8. nooshCRY

[2023-01-08 14:36:44] <GBF6> Now the real question is do you drink the hot dog water from the glas jar?
[2023-01-08 14:36:46] <CptWindwalker82> @Lampzak hotdogs are seasonal?
[2023-01-08 14:36:56] <%+The_Dawnseeker> I also can't remember the last time I had a hotdog instead of a proper sausage
[2023-01-08 14:37:04] <Lampzak> not when you can them
[2023-01-08 14:37:05] <@%+AlexRatman> So like a hotdog in England could just be a sausage in a bun. But in america it's clearly a frank. In Germany it's a frank.

[2023-01-08 15:06:42] <shufflingkitten1> Having a name that gets shortened is kinda like that.
[2023-01-08 15:06:59] <+Senteria> It's hard when the name is impossible to be written in the latin alphabet.
[2023-01-08 15:07:01] <%Nirofen> My name is unpronouncable my most native English speakers simply because our 'r' is different to the English 'r'.
[2023-01-08 15:07:02] <%CrimsonJae> My name was NEVER pronounced right growing up. 80% of the time my teachers would assume it was a spelling error on their sheet instead of just asking me.
[2023-01-08 15:07:04] <%+spacepiratepluto> I get so many people who spell my name horribly.  Sometimes even mispronounce my name.
[2023-01-08 15:07:04] <@%Amarienn> yeah when I was teaching in the US we had a lot of international students and most Chinese students especially just chose a US name not to bother but also the rest we would make sure we can say right
[2023-01-08 15:07:11] <%Akabara86> thats my last name its never pronounced correctly so i just gave up its what ever you say lol
[2023-01-08 15:07:11] <%nemo3538> yeah, my last name is always mispronounced so I just go with it.  whole family has for generations
[2023-01-08 15:07:17] <%Livingofstories> @TheLittlePancakeMonster Yeah it's nice when people make an effort. Mine is pretty doable in English after telling people but the default English pronounciation is very very wrong.

[2023-01-08 15:09:48] <%Livingofstories> I think it was also more difficult to push back on getting them to pronounce it correctly cause you had to fit in with the culture/country etc and you'd be considered difficult for insisting they try and pronounce it right.

[2023-01-08 15:29:20] <maplethistles> new Trigun is about the level of BEASTARS for animation. it's not bad, just takes some getting used to

[2023-01-08 15:29:29] <+AliceCattx> does cg stand for colour grading here or computer graphics lol

[2023-01-08 16:16:59] <A_shuchu> does UK have an array of different dairy products?
[2023-01-08 16:17:01] <+TahliahtheFox> And then then there's that milk that comes in the gold bottle and is like half cream

[2023-01-08 16:34:05] <rookiemillie> any tips on how to help an anxious cat? my cat is a scardy cat and hates anything new (person or furniture)
[2023-01-08 16:34:09] <+DartonLance> My dad feeds his cat every time he makes food so when I moved in  I got my leg carved up every time I cooked
[2023-01-08 16:34:29] <shufflingkitten1> I had a maine coon who was basically like a small dog. She'd follow me around town and stuff cause she was an outdoor cat.

I love that you and Jesse have stayed whom you are/true to your 'Northstar' (Easy Polaris joke) as it were while having your own growth. I really respect that after all this time and hope you keep having fun working the way you do.  We'll keep watching. (Maybe my folks will now too. LUL )

[2023-01-08 16:59:16] <%OfferedLeek> I've been wondering this for a while but I'm curious what you look at when you are talking to "us"? cause it looks like you read chat on your right and your camera is in the middle, but you seem to be making eye contact with something on your left. hope it's not a rude question, just curious doogSweat

[2023-01-08 16:59:21] <vestigial_chill> About vods on youtube, I mostly watch you on youtube and I really enjoy it even not being able to see chat. I think you respond in a way that makes it clear what’s being said. I love sam’s stream clips but really wish he would post vods on youtube too.
[2023-01-08 16:59:26] <%coollike> it's also important to try and put more stock in those hidden metrics, like how engaged or supportive the community is, rather than the metrics that twitch deems most important like live viewers -- they correlate but aren't the same thing
[2023-01-08 16:59:37] <DariusHasDogs> so mission accomplished
[2023-01-08 16:59:42] <%GazbangGoblin> for like half a minute I was looking at your twitch overlay going 'Where did Dodger get those really cute heart shaped christmas lights?' coxDerp

[2023-01-08 17:01:36] <straxbsn> I understand that mindset of feeling like you have to work harder. My boat (sport of rowing) in 2006 would win a race and feel like we were slow and had to train harder, we had to get faster.  Looking back now, damn that boat was fast and our success showed but we really didn't see it at the time.  Sometimes you need someone on the outside to give you perspective.

[2023-01-08 17:04:43] <+MajesticLandwhale> I've heard other streamers talk about dual streaming but only have chat interaction with twitch chat
[2023-01-08 17:04:43] <%+Empty_Cognizance> yay, it's 11am... I can order my friggin pizza soon doogDab
[2023-01-08 17:04:44] <%SilenusHere> Do you have to swear loyalty to get the key?
[2023-01-08 17:04:48] <%$Dohregard> you're basically flooded with emojis that cost money
[2023-01-08 17:04:49] <melodiousthonkvi> Probably Dan is the forefront on the Twitch/TikTok combo. So it’s still up in the air.
[2023-01-08 17:04:52] <%EquinoxPhoenix> YT will catch up to Twitch on the streaming side just before Twitch does a die from everyone leaving it cause they did one bad thing too many
[2023-01-08 17:04:55] <%MattMGK> I've never seen a good TikTok stream
[2023-01-08 17:04:57] <@%$free_doom> but tiktok numbers are very different. you can get millions of likes but translates to no money
[2023-01-08 17:04:57] <%$RMutt1917> I barely seen tiktok at all let alone a stream
[2023-01-08 17:04:57] <@%ArnarBjornss> doogBurn
[2023-01-08 17:05:05] <!MaureenCreates> Yeah, there are prerequisites to TikTok streaming. They aren't too bad, though.
[2023-01-08 17:05:09] <%+mikle255> @free_doom yea their partner agreements suck doogSuffer

[2023-01-08 17:05:12] <%+MichaelL8> from twitch streamers doing tiktok, the main thing is it's a good way of getting discovered on twitch
[2023-01-08 17:05:13] <%MattMGK> That's changing though
[2023-01-08 17:05:15] <+UristMcPutko> its the only place where you get to watch live mexican gun cartel gunfights
[2023-01-08 17:05:16] <+ChickenzForLife> Hey there dooger c:
[2023-01-08 17:05:28] <@%$free_doom> tiktok is for boosting engagement on other platforms
[2023-01-08 17:05:30] <+MajesticLandwhale> tiktok is good for putting your content in front of people, bad at translating it into $
[2023-01-08 17:05:31] <ocelot022> yeah
[2023-01-08 17:05:39] <%JazzJackrabbit> @uristmcputko doogSuffer
[2023-01-08 17:05:44] <+BrotherofAnubus> I’ve seen people get streaming privileges removed problematic people reporting the streamer because they got booted from the stream.
[2023-01-08 17:05:48] <%nemo3538> tik toc is way to try and get people to look at you elsewhere
[2023-01-08 17:05:52] <@%Amarienn> the tiktok shorts Sam and Jesse do seems like a good idea though
[2023-01-08 17:05:58] <+UristMcPutko> @JazzJackrabbit its kinda fucked up
[2023-01-08 17:05:59] <ouss1> yep Dansgaming was talking about converting tiktik viewers into twitch
[2023-01-08 17:06:08] <%MattMGK> Since YouTube started paying people BANK on YT Shorts TikTok is changing how they pay out creators
[2023-01-08 17:06:09] <+MajesticLandwhale> my buddy is a sub 100 follower streamer and pulled like 20k views on a random valorant clip he put on tiktok
[2023-01-08 17:06:17] <Asna> Tiktok also takes 70% of the money on live sessions
[2023-01-08 17:06:20] <%+natures_realm> doogHi doogLurk
[2023-01-08 17:06:25] <Bosseyn> Do youtubers earn money on Youtube shorts or are they mostly for exposure?
[2023-01-08 17:06:25] <Zenguppy> i swear networking is dark magic i will never learn
[2023-01-08 17:06:29] <@%ArnarBjornss> @amarienn oh yeah, similar on Instagram.
[2023-01-08 17:06:33] <JXvicehawk> that makes sense, cause it's just iousey with content
[2023-01-08 17:06:33] <%+AidanFolkes> it's funny how youtube shorts is mostly content from tiktok
