[2023-01-01 01:10:02] <DefianceOrDishonor> @bunitorial Ahhh fair enough. Well one suggestion is to have the wiki maps up while you're in raid, and they show areas Scavs spawn at. Also they usually voiceline as you get nearish them-- but not always.

[2023-01-01 01:49:40] <%SneakySmoker38> problem with that gate is you open the room and the doors in the far back. i dont think you can hit the extract box from wall nudging.
[2023-01-01 01:49:41] <+itzProps> willerz is so fine my gosh
[2023-01-01 01:49:43] <%bootyraider420> kinda dumb since 2 other doors you need factory key for you can still get quest done outside door
[2023-01-01 01:49:48] <+SauceyCos> does santa still lower your rep?
[2023-01-01 01:49:56] <XxDiddleysquatXx> yeah you have always needed the key to exit here....

[2023-01-01 01:52:35] <Izzik> scav on factory for those mp133s early, so many scavs there have it from my experience
[2023-01-01 01:52:36] <%The_Jackel> most pople scav on factory to get wuick spawned loot and to extract right away to farm ascav karma, thats what others do
[2023-01-01 01:52:38] <+7enntoes> @HugeBaguetteSan do you get rep just for extracting?

[2023-01-01 14:53:28] <+Erdnusshund> That is the BEST advice for new players or really anyone that's struggling, don't bother with the high tier stuff just loot, scoot, and learn along the way
[2023-01-01 14:53:29] <%NiteTerror> the pmcs right now dont have good gear.. its a waste
[2023-01-01 14:53:30] <%squidwardstesticals> Bugs me when people only go for high end shit anything is better then Nan empty slot and if you find better shit then swap it out as you go

[2023-01-01 15:28:50] <sp3eedd> impressed you haven't died to a scav yet, mofos have aimbot from 100+
[2023-01-01 15:28:51] <@%Mess1as> oooh noooo, it was a landmine... LUL Actually not surprised Kappa
[2023-01-01 15:28:54] <+Eezias> One thing about grouping vs solo is - except for FF incidents - it takes that many other hostiles of the map.  Sometimes that's the boost you need for one of those frustrating missions.
[2023-01-01 15:28:56] <+Tommy_Kase> @BANKAIlIl Imo, I think since you both got each other's backs, it's indeed easier, but as a solo you don'T have to worry about you mate so your focus is better
[2023-01-01 15:29:00] <%+acexr3kt> @WillerZ do you think scavs are too busted this wipe? Or fine
[2023-01-01 15:29:05] <%trenzi_> @Ferry1337 How is that related to chat

[2023-01-01 15:29:46] <+FOOCHIEFACE> is streets released?
[2023-01-01 15:29:47] <timberstiffy> how many pci'e lanes does that cpu of your have?
[2023-01-01 15:29:52] <SoullessAV> Lol did a big boy kit yesterday for woods . Spawned took 2 steps and blew up 2 landminds. Scaving the next month
[2023-01-01 15:29:55] <+Eezias> A negative is that if you lose track of your friend(s), then you hesitate to shoot on sight.   As a solo you know every other person on the map is hostile.

[2023-01-01 15:30:11] <+JuugMastaRoadrunna> does binural audio make directional sound easier or harder to pinpoint? I can't decide

[2023-01-01 15:30:16] <KBOperator> Solo can be better depending on the teammate. I survive nearly 100% alone, and depending on who I'm with it generally goes down. I play with one guy who will rage his way into getting us both killed frequently. It's more playstyle than number of people
[2023-01-01 15:30:16] <VETOVA> @razorsharp135 im just a suffering enthusiast

[2023-01-01 16:44:22] <+RickyBobbie> good morning
[2023-01-01 16:44:23] <%NsG_PaT> Hypothetical question @WillerZ, if you are running duos and run up on a team of 4 and take heavy damage meanwhile your partner dies, if you have an opportunity to withdraw and reset do you take it or do you die to an unwinable fight trying to get his gear?
[2023-01-01 16:44:26] <salfal670> How much do you make of subs alone if you dont mine me asking?
[2023-01-01 16:44:31] <al_coholiccc> Has anyone figured out how and when you can get to the light house trader?
[2023-01-01 16:44:34] <%HeyDrift> super expensive to lay lines and a very tedious task as fiber optic is super fragile

[2023-01-01 16:50:48] <%+imLelly> @whaxzyyy welcome, head on over to the tarkov website and connect your twitch to your account via the panel on the right. Then type in google "Twitch inventory" and click that, it'll help you track your progress. Watch willerz for 2 hours and you get an award, if you watch for 10 hours you'll get a legendary reward. click claim every time the 2 hours is up, to start the timer on the next reward

[2023-01-01 17:10:34] <wellington44326> @doofizzdrew Tarkov is CPU and GPU intensive. So either choosing a better GPU or CPU that is compatible with your motherboard. Either will help overall framerate in the game.

[2023-01-01 17:12:33] <wellington44326> @Milkonbean Thats incorrect. Tarkov, in this users case would significantly improve from having a better GPU.  Going from even a 1050ti to a 3060, they would see some   improvement in framerate.

[2023-01-01 17:44:45] <+texasblaketimmykiller> Ibuprofen is goated he just didn‚Äôt bring enough water. Then you use it with 1 use left and get free propitol even though those suck now
[2023-01-01 17:44:46] <+ChemicalMarbles> It's only marginally cheaper if you take duration and uses into account. Plus with T3 med statino you can use the leftovers to make 7 propital.
[2023-01-01 17:44:49] <%+Warmaster_OotP> is it cheaper though? if we're talking roubles per hit of vase line vs ibuprofen?

[2023-01-01 18:36:30] <@%^Nightbot> WillerZ currently does not use the Binaural audio, in his opinion it's not ready yet and a bit buggy. He uses the old/normal game audio :)
[2023-01-01 18:36:31] <SarcasticFox_Tv> i saw a lvl 28 in first 3 hours lmao no way that guy was legit
[2023-01-01 18:36:31] <+iloveicecream01> this is the best map in the world

[2023-01-01 18:36:39] <%SexyAhsoka> nvm im just stupid. i was looking at drops from anothewr game... explains why im so confused
[2023-01-01 18:36:40] <%+monketype> @iloveicecream01 it could use a little TLC. it's been a while i think
[2023-01-01 18:36:43] <prozak995> shorlines been pretty much abandoned at this point
[2023-01-01 18:36:46] <MagDumpMedia> shoreline is the worst map for sure it def needs love

[2023-01-01 20:02:13] <+mrtnldm> waited until like 9 minutes once, that seems buggy more than a patience problem :/
[2023-01-01 20:02:16] <+Kryp7iic> everyone goes thru it lol once you are done with that group of quests you are done with it for the wipe lol

[2023-01-01 20:02:17] <Ultimate__Ace> the problem with the shoreline quests is they are all back to back. so you get no break from that dog map
[2023-01-01 20:02:17] <+grekomon> @mrtnldm 9 to 12 minutes is average for me.
