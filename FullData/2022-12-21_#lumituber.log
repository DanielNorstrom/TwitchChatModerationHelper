[2022-12-21 16:02:58] <%+scornthegreat> good question
[2022-12-21 16:03:00] <%WMRain> That's just RTX model
[2022-12-21 16:03:01] <%OMGBEES> you are just loom
[2022-12-21 16:03:01] <White_Wolf256> Both
[2022-12-21 16:03:02] <%nutzerlos> i would say so
[2022-12-21 16:03:03] <gxviiii> no
[2022-12-21 16:03:03] <Denniz93> kinda
[2022-12-21 16:03:03] <%$J_Beefus> You can't cosplay yourself because its not a costume
[2022-12-21 16:03:04] <st0rmyn1ght05> yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:04] <!%o0thelazyartist0o> Technically, yes. Cosplay.
[2022-12-21 16:03:06] <%billybosky> idk
[2022-12-21 16:03:09] <jaylenrui> yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:10] <ArcadiaZer0> both?
[2022-12-21 16:03:11] <@%Pardzival> Technically yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:13] <Heroes_of_Vale> In a meta sense technically yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:13] <%duck7775> I think so yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:14] <skedadle1> Pretty the same
[2022-12-21 16:03:17] <$Fallen_Aries_> True form lumi
[2022-12-21 16:03:17] <%scienceteam_member> yocciPause Its called DLC outfit
[2022-12-21 16:03:17] <%PokeyWartooth> Oooh!  How festive!
[2022-12-21 16:03:18] <%czarneskrzydlanicosci> It is consider... being 200% of yourself xD
[2022-12-21 16:03:18] <AlphaOmega82> not a costume or roleplay If it's just you
[2022-12-21 16:03:20] <$LittleKawaiiCherry> lumi is a real anime girl lumituGASP
[2022-12-21 16:03:22] <%+rennovamocs> I think it'd still be cosplaying. One of my friends who's also a small vtuber did the same.
[2022-12-21 16:03:23] <%jartzamaster> Yes
[2022-12-21 16:03:30] <%billybosky> would be more cosplay if someone else dressed as you. but for you. its your natural outfit.
[2022-12-21 16:03:35] <skullx_638> Sleeeeep

[2022-12-21 16:03:41] <code_shork> equivalent question would be, is batman cosplaying when he puts on the suit
[2022-12-21 16:03:41] <+RDJKR> yashArrive yashB
[2022-12-21 16:03:45] <Denniz93> if it was just the outfit and no ears and wigg then no
[2022-12-21 16:03:45] <%WMRain> Tensile and garland are pretty much the same
[2022-12-21 16:03:45] <%nutzerlos> Its a Cosplay, you cosplaying you 2D/3D Modell
[2022-12-21 16:03:45] <%vinssi__> What a coincidence.I got Pepsi too
[2022-12-21 16:03:59] <dragonfriend7738> if you go as Lumi, then no, if you go as not Lumi, then yes
[2022-12-21 16:04:01] <gxviiii> I cosplay as myself everyday
[2022-12-21 16:04:08] <$Fallen_Aries_> Male or female version of you
[2022-12-21 16:04:09] <White_Wolf256> Is then just living an eternal cosplay?
[2022-12-21 16:04:10] VIEWERS: 816
[2022-12-21 16:04:12] <%EvilInTheAir> tinsel is individual strands. garlands can be made out of tinsel or other stuff strung together
[2022-12-21 16:04:16] <%billybosky> i mean. how can lumi cosplay as lumi.?
[2022-12-21 16:04:18] <%+wolfcypherr> what if someone did a genderbent cosplay of you Lumi?
