[2023-01-03 14:41:19] <siprus92> @AiCandii The problem is that people stop on the road to drop off  people to park and fountain AND that there is lot of through traffic.

[2023-01-03 14:41:24] <BETD23> cos they are all dying?

[2023-01-03 14:41:39] <siprus92> basically the through traffic slows to crawl because lot's of people stop on the road to drop people to the theme park.
