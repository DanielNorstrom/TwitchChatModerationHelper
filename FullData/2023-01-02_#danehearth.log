[2023-01-02 17:29:48] <Ressurect_> Wasn’t it lethal Dane?
[2023-01-02 17:30:06] <@ClawFossil> It was not, because Alignment sets the Nature Project back to 1 mana

[2023-01-02 17:30:25] <Doc___Holliday> Ouch. Missed lethal before - could make everything 1 mana use get 2 crystal and kill with 8 damage from new legendary

[2023-01-02 17:30:41] <Ressurect_> @doc___holliday yup
[2023-01-02 17:31:02] <@ClawFossil> @Doc___Holliday Alignment resets you to 0 mana and sets everything to 1 - you can't play Nature Project after
[2023-01-02 17:31:09] <Doc___Holliday> Nature project would be - mana due to elementals

[2023-01-02 17:31:37] <@ClawFossil> Do the elementals reduce the set cost to 1 effect?
[2023-01-02 17:31:41] <Doc___Holliday> Radiant elemental would set it 0 )l
[2023-01-02 17:32:07] <xnick_uy> @ClawFossil I think that the Echo was completely reworked to avoid that precise case
[2023-01-02 17:32:09] VIEWERS: 150
[2023-01-02 17:32:10] <@ClawFossil> Hmm, not fully sure which order those effects take place in but you may be right
[2023-01-02 17:32:37] <Doc___Holliday> They reduce 1 mana each. So yes - 0 mana for nature project

[2023-01-02 19:31:29] <DrEvel_hs> he might fatigue himself lul
[2023-01-02 19:31:31] <CrazyRampage246> Maybe you hit Finley earlier?
[2023-01-02 19:31:44] <%zantomun> ddos him
[2023-01-02 19:31:58] <some_marw> you didn't hit parrot he has to 4/5s

[2023-01-02 19:33:05] <DrEvel_hs> i dont think he can get through the armor, pretty sure he still loses
[2023-01-02 19:33:07] <bigdgamerboi> Maybe later they will change the plaguespreader so the game can show to us what we transformed
[2023-01-02 19:33:13] <Arphenyte> He doesn't have enough turns I think
[2023-01-02 19:33:38] <Snapjaw100> he'll need 8-ish turns to kill you

[2023-01-02 19:38:02] <Dukenukem3222> Now it looks like that Bran was not enough either, given your amount of armor
[2023-01-02 19:38:04] <skysoul8> they were so cringe
[2023-01-02 19:38:07] <$Takkon> you also had a way to clear the board as rogue
[2023-01-02 19:38:22] <$Takkon> he probably didn't think you could clear him after end of his turns

[2023-01-02 23:14:07] <shirozely> what do you think is the  apm deck good for consistent climb ?
[2023-01-02 23:14:48] <IKNGHT> I wanted to put shadowform in shadow priest but then I found out they took off the 3 dmg upgrade
[2023-01-02 23:14:59] <shirozely> i think its better than the most priest decks
[2023-01-02 23:15:10] <%$grognardish> What part of this deck is 'Priest'? Did you play that earlier, or is that a joke that you're praying for good draw?
