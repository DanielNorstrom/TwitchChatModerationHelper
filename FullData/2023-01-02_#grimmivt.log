[2023-01-02 04:26:15] <%LoremasterofSotek> Grimmi is disgusted by feet, what a fascinating discovery for my Lore Plaques on GrimmiVT!
[2023-01-02 04:26:27] <vuanaunt> 100 redeems of some 1000 point redeem?
[2023-01-02 04:26:34] <@%Extrafuzzy> The points have to come from somewhere in order to increase mine. Which means most of chat will need to take an L
[2023-01-02 04:26:35] <%LoremasterofSotek> Ah, these 22k points will soon have a good use it sounds like
[2023-01-02 04:26:49] <CotePathos> I didn't say stop

[2023-01-02 07:23:20] <%Halbernacht> To think that robots murdering kids is like the most normal part of the franchise compared to this.
[2023-01-02 07:23:21] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Actually it was cysts and other infected/impacted bodies. You cannot prove I have stolen organs.
[2023-01-02 07:23:26] <%LeonidasUmbra> i refuse to accept this is fnaf, its just a fetish thing
[2023-01-02 07:23:33] <%Nullamm> don't know if you wanna describe it as 'getting into' when the topic of the story is mpreg

[2023-01-02 07:28:02] <%staykillerxx> nah figured there will always b3 more
[2023-01-02 07:28:02] <PlushMines> @Prof_PavloVT But you SHOULD
[2023-01-02 07:28:06] <%Halbernacht> It's like watching a wild B movie. But having a spooky anime girl read it at you.
[2023-01-02 07:28:08] <%fabgutwich> "as a human"
[2023-01-02 07:28:08] <%if_you_seiso> like a moth to a flame grimmi14Fine
[2023-01-02 07:28:15] <!%Prof_PavloVT> @Prof_PavloVT If it stops me from being the pilk guy maybe I sh ould
[2023-01-02 07:28:15] <%Nullamm> why is it that everytime I turn around, Grimmi's got these weird titles/assosiactions?   first it was the cat boys now this?
[2023-01-02 07:28:20] <%LoremasterofSotek> You could be an mpregging rabbit monster instead if you want I guess
[2023-01-02 07:28:24] <%$Kloost> time to fall back and recover
[2023-01-02 07:28:24] <%ArcReaper_21> There are A LOT of weird crap out there. @LoremasterofSotek Please never recommend the Inquisitor Draco series to her.
[2023-01-02 07:28:26] <%$Tempest_52> This is scarier than the games
[2023-01-02 07:28:33] <fed_kaczynski> indeed it didd
[2023-01-02 07:28:36] <%LeonidasUmbra> i was too mad at Matt to care about the mpreg
[2023-01-02 07:28:36] <%$Petrihaku_> just got here wtf is going on grimmi14OHNO
[2023-01-02 07:28:37] <supermariogravyboat> And to think you could, at least at one point, go buy FNAF bedsheets for your kids. Great series to raise your kids on
[2023-01-02 07:28:39] <PlushMines> True!
[2023-01-02 07:28:40] <%code_phoenix410> 'I liked it' Grimmi 2023 on fnaf mpreg lore
[2023-01-02 07:28:40] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I don't think they can do anything to you for reading their book on stream.
[2023-01-02 07:28:44] <+luke5260> This was horror! It's in the tag on your channel, can't deny that!
[2023-01-02 07:28:45] <%LoremasterofSotek> @ArcReaper_21 WE DON'T RECOMMEND WEIRD WARHAMMER STUFF HERE
[2023-01-02 07:28:53] <%Yayifications> Honestly it was pretty good apart from a few nitpicks...and the fact this is marketed to children.
[2023-01-02 07:28:56] <+minister_crv> Is Dead Space code for me Mpreg?
[2023-01-02 07:29:05] <%$eleni_afk> You have no breaks next week if you do.. grimmi14OHNO
[2023-01-02 07:29:05] <+minister_crv> more*
[2023-01-02 07:29:06] <%Yayifications> Like that whole part with Gene was kinda pointless
[2023-01-02 07:29:06] <%k_yama_> nah, just play for 10mins and then call it a stream just like you did for MGS3
[2023-01-02 07:29:07] <%LeonidasUmbra> grimmi rest as some point
[2023-01-02 07:29:07] <!%socialistOtter> awww, it's ending...
[2023-01-02 07:29:08] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> Grimmi stream
[2023-01-02 07:29:12] <!%Prof_PavloVT> It would?
[2023-01-02 07:29:13] <Tenosis> Only slightly
[2023-01-02 07:29:15] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Matt deserved what he got.
[2023-01-02 07:29:15] <!%socialistOtter> see you later, Grimmi
[2023-01-02 07:29:18] <%Realkoolxmx> Pregnancy?! grimmi14Grimmilin

[2023-01-02 07:29:25] <%fabgutwich> LUL
[2023-01-02 07:29:28] <!%Prof_PavloVT> Usually they impregnate themselves with you
[2023-01-02 07:29:32] <spookgerook> If you are wondering, no intercourse was involved
[2023-01-02 07:29:33] <PlushMines> When Matt cried i literally thought "I have never not sympathized this much with a person crying before"
[2023-01-02 07:29:35] <%$eleni_afk> Gator?..
