[2022-12-03 00:17:43] <%+BubbaDoongai> I'd rather buy the mine item than use a weapon slot on a screwdriver

[2022-12-03 00:21:27] <Shoobinator> how much splode can we get?  All the splode
[2022-12-03 00:21:28] <TheBrokenAce> Only illegal if you get caught.
[2022-12-03 00:21:39] <%infidelzombie> None more splode.
[2022-12-03 00:21:40] <Alwaysgonnathrow> this run is blessed

[2022-12-03 00:22:47] <%simian56> There's not that many items tagged with explosive, so those items show up a lot
[2022-12-03 00:23:36] <plague_1> what's the non shredder weapon you got there
[2022-12-03 00:23:55] <%simian56> the nuclear launcher
[2022-12-03 00:24:12] <%doomtrain404> This guy is so bad to face as soldier

[2022-12-03 00:24:58] <Shoobinator> Nuclear Launch Detected
[2022-12-03 00:25:12] <%+enkidu2> This run is insane
[2022-12-03 00:25:15] <firedron> PogChamp
[2022-12-03 00:25:23] <%Endur1n> What the hell lol
[2022-12-03 00:25:45] VIEWERS: 1 002
[2022-12-03 00:25:46] <%infidelzombie> This run violates some international treaties.
[2022-12-03 00:25:51] <Shoobinator> Not enough supply depots, must build more supply depos ( for more nukes )
[2022-12-03 00:25:55] <Bomberboy99> why do you like move speed so much?
[2022-12-03 00:25:57] <%+twitchtaeric> I had a similar run.  Concentrated on attack speed and was basically non-stop nukes.
[2022-12-03 00:25:57] <inertiv> this reminds me of the dual obliderator (sp?) you got yesterday
[2022-12-03 00:26:07] <%Migishu> need more nuke launchers
[2022-12-03 00:26:14] <TheBrokenAce> Still have to keep outrunning the tide, but a 1/5th of the screen just being decimeated every other second.
[2022-12-03 00:26:36] <%Endur1n> What is the nuke crit multiplier?
[2022-12-03 00:26:40] VIEWERS: 1 002
[2022-12-03 00:26:57] <tt1me89> Have you managed a stand still type build yet?
[2022-12-03 00:27:08] <paparatto18> holy that is a big explosion
[2022-12-03 00:27:33] <Shoobinator> Booms are almost as big as the screen
[2022-12-03 00:27:41] <Deuzim> baalorlord sir, im sorry but i have to inform you that your build is illegal
[2022-12-03 00:28:01] <Shoobinator> The funny thing is he can still technically die
[2022-12-03 00:28:02] <%+BubbaDoongai> stand still build dies to wave 20 in my experience
[2022-12-03 00:28:40] VIEWERS: 1 105
[2022-12-03 00:28:45] <%Migishu> needs more crit
[2022-12-03 00:29:00] <%teutonic_nite> can explosions crit?
[2022-12-03 00:29:04] <Bomberboy99> so overpowered
[2022-12-03 00:29:04] <Shoobinator> The only thing scarier than big booms and double nuke is big booms double nukes AND ricochet

[2022-12-03 00:29:05] <rainvt> is this game vampire survivors but with potatoes
[2022-12-03 00:29:05] <Shoobinator> Kappa
[2022-12-03 00:29:12] <SirBefBef> this is kinda nuts
[2022-12-03 00:29:22] <%Endur1n> @rainvt yes
[2022-12-03 00:29:29] <RandyB123> @rainvt yeah, and a lot more build control
[2022-12-03 00:29:31] <%RaavaRoo> this is just silly now
[2022-12-03 00:29:35] [Notification] TheDroidYouAreLookingFor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! [this is majestic]
[2022-12-03 00:29:40] <rainvt> is it also more fun than it has any right to be?
[2022-12-03 00:29:53] <inertiv> yes
[2022-12-03 00:29:58] <%doomtrain404> @rainvt To be fair this is some seriously crazy stuff, usually the potato struggles to live
[2022-12-03 00:29:59] <+CatTheGirl> bigger!
[2022-12-03 00:30:11] <%Ingenol> I've definitely made the mistake of misreading my stats in conjunction with the couch tooltip and taken it to great detriment
[2022-12-03 00:30:13] <unvoid_> looks like a perfect build to idle in a corner^^
[2022-12-03 00:30:17] <%Endur1n> This is absurd lol
[2022-12-03 00:30:28] <nutritionalvape> where did the white outline for explosions go?
[2022-12-03 00:30:34] <%windgraze> Almost feels like a good run for a statue
[2022-12-03 00:30:39] <Shoobinator> Baalar can still technically die folks.  It's called hubris

[2022-12-03 00:30:46] <nutritionalvape> huh
[2022-12-03 00:31:00] <%Migishu> I found the flashing effect to be distracting so I turned it off as well
[2022-12-03 00:31:10] <nutritionalvape> thats fair, I thought it got removed lol
[2022-12-03 00:31:11] <ExtensionGaloisienne> YEP the white flash is annoying to me too
[2022-12-03 00:31:12] <%teutonic_nite> fixied -100% dmg lol
[2022-12-03 00:31:35] <%Migishu> Need ricochet
[2022-12-03 00:31:37] <%+TheDroidYouAreLookingFor> just needs classical music and slow-mo while everything just goes boom
[2022-12-03 00:31:37] <Shoobinator> It sadly actually isn't as good as you might want
[2022-12-03 00:31:40] <%+enkidu2> this is silly now
[2022-12-03 00:31:46] <%haligonian89> Now?
[2022-12-03 00:31:53] <%haligonian89> This has been silly for a while
[2022-12-03 00:31:57] <TheBrokenAce> Is this build good enough for Barricade?
[2022-12-03 00:31:58] <%Migishu> Ricochet would break this open hilariously
[2022-12-03 00:32:05] <inertiv> he can bleed :o
[2022-12-03 00:32:13] <ExtensionGaloisienne> does this build beat the heart?
[2022-12-03 00:32:25] <%ZYMixx> no enemy behind after the first hit))

[2022-12-03 00:32:55] <ExtensionGaloisienne> dang it
[2022-12-03 00:32:58] <%doomtrain404> Gives him lots of block
[2022-12-03 00:33:07] <%windgraze> did a double statue run with old man earlier. It was... hard
[2022-12-03 00:33:23] <+CatTheGirl> being faster means they just group up sooner!
[2022-12-03 00:33:24] <RandyB123> oh no.. enemy speed. what will we do?
[2022-12-03 00:33:35] <ExtensionGaloisienne> this is the least useful lumberjack shirt i've ever seen
[2022-12-03 00:33:59] <Shoobinator> Fast enemies don't matter when you move faster than them AND you destroy everything just by existing
[2022-12-03 00:34:03] <%infidelzombie> Wassamatter tree, can't take a nuke?
[2022-12-03 00:34:07] <RandyB123> LUL i supposed nuking a tree probably does the trick already
[2022-12-03 00:34:12] <%Endur1n> With this speed I'd totally run into a big guy and die LUL
[2022-12-03 00:34:13] <statisticaly_bad_at_stats> you are lacking in the health regen department imo
[2022-12-03 00:34:29] <paparatto18> BOP

[2022-12-03 18:24:02] <@%FaeLyka> there is an unwinnable Jaw Worm seed! it's KAQ4 Kappa
[2022-12-03 18:24:06] <DrPizzazz> Does the seed also determine draw order then?
[2022-12-03 18:24:10] <@%FaeLyka> yes
[2022-12-03 18:24:11] <FunnyMan3595> The thing about "impossible" seeds is that even if a seed isn't truly impossible, the actions needed to win it may not be sensible ones to take in normal play.
[2022-12-03 18:24:16] <@%FaeLyka> seed determines everything
[2022-12-03 18:24:24] <firedron> Is this gonna be A5 run?

[2022-12-03 18:24:38] <Emjit> The nature of proving it restricts the search space alot, im sure theres a whole bunch of unwinnable seeds that are virtually unprovable unwinnable
[2022-12-03 18:24:41] <@%FaeLyka> there exist unwinnable seeds that cannot be found with the current search criteria, also

[2022-12-03 18:25:21] <%whoisnoah> Problem is some seeds could be unwinnable but not unwinnable until A2 or whatever. Such a huge number of ways to run 1 seed and have to exhaust all attempts to prove its unwinnable.
[2022-12-03 18:25:26] <@%FaeLyka> there can be runs where you get damage cards but can't get past some Act 1 gauntlet

[2022-12-03 18:27:34] <%neruzeee> scrape is my most hated card in the game
[2022-12-03 18:27:36] <RecreationalTrees> Why do you say thunder strike shouldn’t exist?
[2022-12-03 18:27:37] <@zyzzyvivification> But can the defect understand a broken heart?
[2022-12-03 18:27:42] <Sinanata> wdym if you channel 100 lightning its 700 dmg
[2022-12-03 18:27:46] <Lamguin> The Defect only needs 5 cards: Reprogram, Hologram, Strike, Strike, Defend

[2022-12-03 18:28:30] <%robbaq> Defect runs either make you feel utter despair or impossible joy, there's rarely any middle ground

[2022-12-03 18:28:32] <jacuzzidiamonds> do u think thunderstrike woudl be better if the upgrade was an energy cost reduction :)
[2022-12-03 18:28:34] <%+kokasokaloka> it's too expensive imo

[2022-12-03 18:28:59] <Sherrybird> windmill strike seems worse to me thats about it
[2022-12-03 18:29:04] <+BoogerBusz> thunderstrike is super expensive and doesnt hit hard until very late in the fight
[2022-12-03 18:29:07] <%0solace0> Huh-

[2022-12-03 18:29:23] <shjark> It’s hilarious how much worse it is than blizzard which can actually be useful
[2022-12-03 18:29:23] <+WteLotuS> one thing I find interesting is that I "feel" some cards stronger than some other cards, but I don't know the "why" behind this feeling
[2022-12-03 18:29:24] <AlwaysDMB> thunder strike is nice once you already have necronom LUL
[2022-12-03 18:29:24] <Jonneponken> its good if you play the ultra laser card
[2022-12-03 18:29:28] <%spiritsparrow> probably only for snecko
[2022-12-03 18:29:31] <jacuzzidiamonds> baalor watches amaz?? PogChamp
[2022-12-03 18:29:33] <%+kokasokaloka> what if it was like electrodynamics but just for the cast?
[2022-12-03 18:29:36] <jacuzzidiamonds> no wonder he is so good....
[2022-12-03 18:29:43] <%+kokasokaloka> so it would do 7 to every enemy
[2022-12-03 18:29:54] <saladfart69> I think thunder strike is for lightning decks without focus @Baalorlord
[2022-12-03 18:29:57] <jacuzzidiamonds> what if thunder strike was gain block per lightning PauseChamp
[2022-12-03 18:29:58] <Midbros> much more reasonable 1 cost
[2022-12-03 18:29:59] <vortexcurse13> @baalorlord how would you change Thunder Strike for it to be better as a rare card
[2022-12-03 18:30:30] <gammahutka> play pls
[2022-12-03 18:30:30] <%Errantinlad> The trick to thunderstrike is to reach negative focus, so all your lightning orbs fail to  kill the enemy.  Easy.

[2022-12-03 18:32:36] <blurst_> the lore is hinted at but not really expanded on
[2022-12-03 18:32:36] <ICWobbles> other thing to remember for cards is they do different things, but one thing they all do is take up space in your deck and hand. which is why card removes are baller, and skipping cards is also baller

[2022-12-03 18:32:55] <FunnyMan3595> It's worth noting that the game doesn't *need* every card to be universally useful.  Bad and highly-situational cards help make the game more interesting.

[2022-12-03 18:35:01] <%doomtrain404> Defect is interesting in this respect.  Your deck will make a certain number and type of orbs per rotation, and mostly "good" cards let you break this limitation.
[2022-12-03 18:35:02] <roedtogsvart> what are good common cards to look for early on in a defect run that can still have an impact later on?

[2022-12-03 18:37:20] <%entendir> does scrape discard reflex and tactician?

[2022-12-03 18:37:28] <%leetnanas> Is it incorrect logic to say the draw and discard evens out always between discarding good and bad cards?

[2022-12-03 18:37:45] <roedtogsvart> an AI could be trained very easily to be good at this game. the cards can be quantified

[2022-12-03 18:39:54] <%doomtrain404> Scrape is also a weird card in that you may actually want to just discard a bunch of cards.

[2022-12-03 18:53:20] <%tiefull> winning as defect.
[2022-12-03 18:53:23] <samazing8> why a5 and not a0 guys?
[2022-12-03 18:53:33] <+spinesheath> I'm pretty sure I had runs with way less than 50 floors
[2022-12-03 18:53:33] <%tiefull> to add a little challenge
[2022-12-03 18:54:03] <%barrythechopstick> @samazing8 I think because at a4 all enemies do the max damage possible and a5 for a bit more challenge
[2022-12-03 18:54:14] <%doomtrain404> The devs said the game was balanced at this ascension apparently.
[2022-12-03 18:54:48] VIEWERS: 973
[2022-12-03 18:54:57] <%scyphus43> then a20 isnt balanced?
[2022-12-03 18:55:08] <%tiefull> a20 is meant to be very hard
[2022-12-03 18:55:16] <samazing8> balanced means easy?
[2022-12-03 18:55:20] <%doomtrain404> It's balanced for someone who wants max difficulty. LUL
[2022-12-03 18:55:22] <%FeatherFallTT> yay! get my daily dose of Baalor

[2022-12-03 18:55:34] <%Joshprox> that poor lonely unhighlighted leg
[2022-12-03 18:55:38] <+spinesheath> well, since a20 is harder than a5, and your stuff doesn't get any better... it obviously is differently balanced
[2022-12-03 18:55:45] <twitchforgotmyaccount> IIRC they said it's the "intended experience." A20 is absolutely brutal if you don't have a lot of hours in the game.
[2022-12-03 18:55:50] <blurst_> a20 requires specific answers and makes some decks completely useless
[2022-12-03 18:55:58] VIEWERS: 973
[2022-12-03 18:56:04] <blurst_> or mostly useless

[2022-12-03 19:03:02] <gordionknot> internally i categorize those as “value”

[2022-12-03 19:03:15] <@%FaeLyka> @firedron I disagree. Hello World is very good, and can be used as a showcase

[2022-12-03 19:06:31] <%+EriKyoto> The problem I run into with Hello World is my deck starts to get flooded with mediocre cards. Is it better to wait on Hello World or should it be played as soon as possible?

[2022-12-03 19:07:18] <+RudeDemiGawd> @EriKyoto from my experience, it depends on fight
[2022-12-03 19:07:29] <+RudeDemiGawd> on the fight*
[2022-12-03 19:07:38] <Much_King> @EriKyoto Hello world is good act 1 in laga and cube fights, as strikes and defends are the worst cards you get, late you just dont play it
[2022-12-03 19:07:58] <+RudeDemiGawd> or by act 3 remove it
[2022-12-03 19:08:04] <Much_King> @EriKyoto So you don't flood you deck with bad cards if all the cards you have are worse :D
[2022-12-03 19:08:16] <%+reinroux> @Much_King with that explanation, it feels like you're picking something that becomes a curse later...
[2022-12-03 19:08:47] <TTRPG4kids> You frequently have to take cards to solve specific problems in act 1 and 2 that aren't as useful later in the game.

[2022-12-03 19:13:03] <Escalavrator> why kill when you can humiliate the lice?
[2022-12-03 19:13:04] <1TigerbotHesh1> Good sts advice; if you can win the fight, wiin the fight
[2022-12-03 19:13:06] <SuperSiss> yeah rebound strike on back one + dualcast was guaranteed
[2022-12-03 19:13:07] <%Ingenol> so nice when those guys have no hp

[2022-12-03 19:13:31] <donotputmeonpizza> @maverator Dualcast first is nearly always better, as it lets you make decisions based on where lightning hits
[2022-12-03 19:13:35] <beepbeepyeah> @beepbeepyeah lmao, just teasing : )
[2022-12-03 19:13:41] <gordionknot> stack is kinda hello world synergy innit
[2022-12-03 19:14:17] <FunnyMan3595> Dualcast last would have been better in that case, because we could guaranteed kill the back one with two attacks, then the front one with dualcast.

[2022-12-03 19:15:16] <FunnyMan3595> The only bad outcome was dualcast killing the back one, leaving us without enough damage to kill the front.
[2022-12-03 19:15:19] <Herazahra> @FunnyMan3595 dualcast 1st leads to a 100% kill on both, cause of the 2 atks in hand. no matter the hits of dc

[2022-12-03 19:15:51] <Polymorphzz> @Herazahra due to curl up this is false
[2022-12-03 19:15:53] <nanoha272> funny is right, dual first wasnt 100%

[2022-12-03 19:16:09] <FunnyMan3595> Yeah, curl up prevented us from killing the front one with two attacks.
[2022-12-03 19:16:16] <@%FaeLyka> dual first was lethal 75% of the time, and no damage otherwise
[2022-12-03 19:16:30] <FunnyMan3595> Yup.  It worked, though, so no biggie.

[2022-12-03 19:27:04] <FunnyMan3595> I mean, the real nit-picky would be calling it "spending a fire action", since you're doing something, not skipping.
[2022-12-03 19:27:08] <Annibal> @tiefull Yeah, i wouldn't point that out, but this is a tutorial and i know someone will comment on youtube xD

[2022-12-03 19:32:24] <FunnyMan3595> Being able to remove or negate the downside turns biased from a "fight ender" that you can't play too early, into a "super buff" that you play ASAP.

[2022-12-03 20:13:49] <Steffenfield> Does that Bestiary mod affect progress or achievements in game?  I'm still unlocking junk.
[2022-12-03 20:13:50] <bekchiofwar> It's a little inconsistent with how the game rewards you in previous Acts, but I wouldn't necessarily call it "unfair".

[2022-12-03 21:32:13] <%FluctuationEM> hmm, surprsingly large amount of starter cards with smiling mask
[2022-12-03 21:32:19] <KrypticDiamond> has baalor done ladders recently? i was away for about 2 years

[2022-12-03 21:32:39] ~[390/400] The final 10 wins - !gamevote (Slay the Spire)~
[2022-12-03 21:32:46] <KrypticDiamond> gotcha
[2022-12-03 21:32:54] <KrypticDiamond> i guess they lost their novelty and a20 is more interesting?
[2022-12-03 21:32:59] VIEWERS: 1 574
[2022-12-03 21:33:28] <%sparrow1762> He mentioned on one recent stream that he might do another ladder after the 400 wins challenge is over
[2022-12-03 21:33:28] <simmarine_> probably moreso about doing 400 heart wins in a year id think
[2022-12-03 21:33:32] <@%FaeLyka> we also have the 400 challenge this year
[2022-12-03 21:33:54] <KrypticDiamond> oh shit that's crazy
[2022-12-03 21:33:58] <KrypticDiamond> 400 at a20 ya?
[2022-12-03 21:34:06] <@%FaeLyka> yup
[2022-12-03 21:34:07] <@%FaeLyka> !400
[2022-12-03 21:34:08] <@%baalorbot> @FaeLyka Baalor's 2022 challenge: Get 100 A20 Heart kills with every character during the year, for 400 total. Each character will be run until they win, before rotating to the next one. This will ensure all characters reach 100 kills at the same time! Current challenge status: https://baalorlord.tv/400
[2022-12-03 21:34:39] <KrypticDiamond> awesome

[2022-12-03 21:35:18] <%tiefull> !chair
[2022-12-03 21:35:18] <@%baalorbot> @tiefull baalorChair no longer lives with Baalor, but will continue to join us onscreen! baalorChair
[2022-12-03 21:35:19] <%+jake89832> ladder is so much fun, I've been doing ironclad a1h-a20h and haven't gotten past a5 yet. gives a great gradual increase in difficulty and the tension from chaining winstreaks as if I'm a good player is good too
[2022-12-03 21:35:32] <KrypticDiamond> did he get rid of the chair because desk was better for posture or something?
[2022-12-03 21:35:56] <%tiefull> posture, and i think he said after he moved, he didnt have a lot of room for it

[2022-12-03 21:36:20] <KrypticDiamond> @jake89832 totally agree! i tried that the year before i had to leave and got to a17 once only (every other run ended around 10 or before). SO tense.
[2022-12-03 21:36:50] <KrypticDiamond> you start being really critical of every mistake on higher ascensions

[2022-12-03 21:38:00] <%+kokasokaloka> The spire will collapse and the world will be saved
[2022-12-03 21:38:01] <%tiefull> yep. 10 more wins and the game will be deleted from steam, never to be played again. by anybody. ever.

[2022-12-03 21:47:26] <%RootReducer> @Baalorlord have you thought about your goals for next year? Not sure if you've talked about it here yet :)

[2022-12-03 21:50:40] <%+jake89832> exhume is like a strike that exhausts itself but does no damage

[2022-12-03 21:51:09] <@%baalorbot> @沒有道理 Baalor uses Slay the Relics (hover over), Relic Stats (tracking), mapmarks (node highlighting and map drawing - !map), UI sliders to reposition the discard/exhaust piles, Run History Plus (better run history information), and Bestiary (cataloguing of enemy AI - !bestiary). For general QOL, he recommends Minty Spire though he doesn't use it.
