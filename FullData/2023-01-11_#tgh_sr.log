[2023-01-11 09:21:31] <Kappatechy> I think-- and don't quote me on this-- if your OPPONENT uses fire on you, that thaws you.

[2023-01-11 10:09:46] <%Mirby_Studios> they can only hire so many more before they have to move to a bigger building which would cause delays in and of itself

[2023-01-11 10:09:51] <ecceweirdo> anime is dedge. they retired ash

[2023-01-11 10:10:10] <%Mirby_Studios> and the anime isn't dead they're continuing it
[2023-01-11 10:10:10] <Idixal> And also, more developers doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean more efficient development
[2023-01-11 10:10:17] <%endrift> I can't believe Ash Ketchum is fucking dead
[2023-01-11 10:10:19] <%Mirby_Studios> just because ash is done doesn't mean the anime is over
[2023-01-11 10:10:38] <%endrift> Someone with the name Ash Ketchup joined the mGBA discord a few days ago and I was really tempted to tell him that joke was older than he was

[2023-01-11 10:10:49] <%endrift> but I guess it's possible he was younger than 25
[2023-01-11 10:10:53] <%endrift> *older

[2023-01-11 10:10:57] <%Mirby_Studios> also hiring new employees also takes time away from development cause they have to be trained and acclimated to the systems
[2023-01-11 10:10:58] <%LightLunas> well there's the STAB Flamethrower
[2023-01-11 10:11:08] <%endrift> @Kappatechy Goh is a good boy
[2023-01-11 10:11:10] <%Mirby_Studios> like "just hire more people" isn't a magic bandaid for development

[2023-01-11 10:11:18] <ecceweirdo> i hope Goh gets eaten by a guzzlord

[2023-01-11 10:45:42] <Katooie> I had an amazing Manectric with Huge Power and I decided to use it (Only Sp. ATK moves), but I didn't count the run as valid

[2023-01-11 10:46:10] <Katooie> Eh, I don't make the rules

[2023-01-11 10:46:48] <ecceweirdo> it still sucks for confusion
[2023-01-11 10:47:01] <%LightLunas> most people play it that way, that catching one with that ability just doesn't count, you go back to your main before and can catch in the same area again, the actual rules just say to pivot to something else before the next trainer battle
[2023-01-11 10:47:02] <Katooie> Of course it's made to torture you
[2023-01-11 10:47:04] <Katooie> it's Kaizo
[2023-01-11 10:47:04] <Annibal> Either you count the catch void or you never use phy attack, in my eyes either of that is valid
[2023-01-11 10:47:27] <%SweetLew_> rules are meant to help you and keep things structured

[2023-01-11 11:23:13] <Izandai> Smoke ball is literally useless in trainer battles. It could be a thing that you luck into that lets the time before the first trainer battle be a bit less painful, but instead it's an unlucky thing that if you don't notice it it snipes your run from across the city.

[2023-01-11 12:38:35] <Finngus> Big mandela effect on Drill Peck not being high crit, damn
[2023-01-11 12:38:36] <TrjnRabbit> EQ and Shadow Ball both have mons that are immune
[2023-01-11 12:38:40] <%+Draggo__x3> I like Wing Attack a lot
[2023-01-11 12:38:49] <blargerer> it might be like top 5 physical moves
[2023-01-11 12:38:55] <%smohrwz> wooooooobbuffet
[2023-01-11 12:39:01] <TrjnRabbit> Double Kick is contact too but also grewt
[2023-01-11 12:39:09] <%0ldmanbiff> I pp maxed a wing attack, 56 pp is nice
[2023-01-11 12:39:16] <%+Draggo__x3> Top 5 for me hmmm
[2023-01-11 12:39:22] <ecceweirdo> #1 EQ, #2 drill peck, #3 shadow ball, #4 low kick, #5 return
[2023-01-11 12:39:30] <Finngus> Double Kick is double contact
[2023-01-11 12:39:48] <Cryten0> now I am wondering if there is a pure fighting special attack mon
[2023-01-11 12:39:51] <%Rootballa> double kick is extremely good, i think that might actually be one of the most underrated moves
[2023-01-11 12:39:51] <%LightLunas> it absolutely is, but only because most fighting moves are ass, and there's not that many LUL
[2023-01-11 12:39:58] <%$EDL666> Okay okay, hear me out tho
[2023-01-11 12:40:02] <TrjnRabbit> Exactly, the second kick removes contact

[2023-01-11 14:41:25] <%carrarium> been fun! learning the job, but it doesn't feel like work.

[2023-01-11 14:41:40] <Atro> I'm glad its there for people who like it, but I can't watch 7 hours of FF7
[2023-01-11 14:41:45] <%DarkraiReaper> at least Dunsparce's evolution was just Game Freak going "Okay can you shut up about it needing an evo?!"
[2023-01-11 14:41:46] <%+Rob_EZ_LnP> It didn‚Äôt look like the fakemon fire and grass type I had in mind, but Scovillain is cool I guess

[2023-01-11 14:42:16] <elitegames3543> you can't force friendship... that's society's problem now
[2023-01-11 14:42:23] <TommZee> I hope it becomes a Crobat for the haha funny moment
[2023-01-11 14:42:27] <%S17Master> How many steps are we at?
[2023-01-11 14:42:33] <Atro> friendship evolution happens faster if you have the battle pass
[2023-01-11 14:42:34] <%AwakenSmok3> @TommZee It can't
[2023-01-11 14:42:36] <TommZee> Oh, really?
[2023-01-11 14:42:46] <%DarkraiReaper> maybe it updates if you change areas? barbThink

[2023-01-11 14:43:05] <%$EDL666> In the identity thingy
[2023-01-11 14:43:19] <%+theSkyfisher> does that mean azuril would evolve into a normal type?
[2023-01-11 14:43:23] <%S17Master> I cannot imagine Soothe Bell would actually be considered illegal if the question was brought up
[2023-01-11 14:43:29] <%AwakenSmok3> Does the tracker list potential evolutions?
[2023-01-11 14:43:41] <%LightLunas> since Soothe Bell amplifies friendship increases by 50%, and steps add friendship by +1 every time, maybe Soothe Bell really does nothing here...
[2023-01-11 14:43:48] <%smohrwz> the soothe bell is a counterfeit

[2023-01-11 14:44:39] <alighieri018> I could‚Äôve sworn the tracker does it
[2023-01-11 14:44:45] <%Finngus> Maybe it's actually screwing up the algorithm here and rounding it to 0 LUL
[2023-01-11 14:44:51] <%LightLunas> I don't know, but in Pok√©mon it's generally safe to assume that things round down
[2023-01-11 14:44:55] <%AwakenSmok3> @rayin6 It will change from FRIEND to SOON
