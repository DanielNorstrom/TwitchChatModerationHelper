[2023-01-09 10:01:50] <shaddy42> cap is always the same since start of the game
[2023-01-09 10:01:52] <+fenriwow> the game is fully horizontal
[2023-01-09 10:01:54] <+chrishuge> Yep, then they added mastery points to give you something to progress towards at cap

[2023-01-09 10:03:43] <%+avenlaya1> @Preachlfw levels really dont have a big impact of the game, except for the ability to go to all the zones without getting one shot
[2023-01-09 10:03:44] <%Garfried> Some people say the game begins at 80
[2023-01-09 10:03:44] <foodrepublic> there's a few ways to get to 80 in like 15 minutes
[2023-01-09 10:03:45] <%+대전허리케인 (daejeon_hurricane)> core game is gw2's ARR!
[2023-01-09 10:03:51] <+scoob79> GW1 was the same was it not?
[2023-01-09 10:03:54] <%beskarsilver> GW1 had the same idea
[2023-01-09 10:03:54] <@%Methuzahla> it does 100%
[2023-01-09 10:03:56] <Warden120> Feel like FF14 is slowly getting that problem
[2023-01-09 10:03:57] <%+Reiyayru> When I first played GW2 when it first came out I leveled to 80 having no idea what the heck I was doing beyond running around and doing WvWvW
[2023-01-09 10:03:59] <%NomadHook> Yeah Leveling is really quick (it even throws a lot of ways to bypass leveling entirely)
[2023-01-09 10:04:02] <neopolitan_eagle> base gw2 is like base ff14
[2023-01-09 10:04:05] <BaronSolace> compare base gw2 to ARR, it gets better as you go

[2023-01-09 10:04:16] <%+lalandir> Yep
[2023-01-09 10:04:16] <%+Zappik> it is casual mmo
[2023-01-09 10:04:17] <%Shelana95> It is semi true
[2023-01-09 10:04:20] <+fenriwow> recently they added some more hardcore stuff but essentially yea
[2023-01-09 10:04:21] <SANEST_FLORIDA_MAN> casual and nothing wrong with that, very fun
[2023-01-09 10:04:22] <DunesGames> It's pretty casual/transmog heavy
[2023-01-09 10:04:23] <+scoob79> Man, when he gets into the living world season 4 and up.
[2023-01-09 10:04:29] <pyrix0> It has some good hard content too, to be fair, but you're going for sideways progression.

[2023-01-09 10:04:30] <+chrishuge> GW2 is great to play casually, it's been my 'second' MMO for years. You can go fairly hard if you want to though
[2023-01-09 10:04:30] <+KeyrisNyan> it is gigacasual

[2023-01-09 10:05:00] <mez_taz> @Preachlfw btw there isn't any traditional questing. The quests are inbuilt to the achivement system and the open world events

[2023-01-09 10:05:55] <+Mackemm73> Inventory is like ESO.  They deliberately make it a pain in order to monetise it
[2023-01-09 10:05:55] <oakdavite> Guild Wars 2 is Inventory Wars vs. Fashion Wars
[2023-01-09 10:05:56] <%KelticNight> LUL
[2023-01-09 10:05:59] <%voltagg3> It gets more cohesive soon and the delivery gets better later
[2023-01-09 10:06:00] <+kalamari__> you are not using all the tools for your inventory though
[2023-01-09 10:06:06] <%Puzzleface> thats a gw2 base story problem across all the races
[2023-01-09 10:06:06] <+Trigarta> The female norn voice is not the best.
[2023-01-09 10:06:07] <nemosaurus_> @methuzahla i'm usa so sometimes it's hard for me to keep up. is there a youtube channel for vods?
[2023-01-09 10:06:07] <%+lalandir> Sounds about right
[2023-01-09 10:06:08] <BaronSolace> ^^^^
[2023-01-09 10:06:11] <%+avenlaya1> @Preachlfw the story gets much much better after the "personal story"
[2023-01-09 10:06:12] <%NomadHook> Yeah, very "Young Adult Novel" style
[2023-01-09 10:06:14] <%KelticNight> so it's Star Wars then? monkaHmm
[2023-01-09 10:06:14] <%+Geri_0123> You chose the worst start
[2023-01-09 10:06:15] <Mnevea> Yeah the vanilla story is pretty bad. I would say the post level 30 story is atleast slightly more interesting atleast
[2023-01-09 10:06:19] <tobbelitoinfinito> Treat it like a superhero movie
[2023-01-09 10:06:31] <%+cacklewood> depends on what events you walk into
[2023-01-09 10:06:31] <Visg> game looks really good
[2023-01-09 10:06:32] <an_p0> HoT zones PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 10:06:39] <+kalamari__> you can also do pvp/wvw to get PVE levels @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 10:06:42] <DunesGames> Tbh it's a lot better without a mount as you go to 80
[2023-01-09 10:06:47] <+FafferUK> Think i only completed 2/3 zones all the way to 80
[2023-01-09 10:06:47] <DunesGames> to get immersed
[2023-01-09 10:06:48] <%+Sprakenheit> I actually liked the story but I played GW2 before FF

[2023-01-09 10:07:09] <Irvatar> It got repetitive for me after 50
[2023-01-09 10:07:11] <Kokleekio> the expansion zones will be much better
[2023-01-09 10:07:13] <alwiro> D: that poor mount

[2023-01-09 10:07:47] <%beskarsilver> It's an ARR > HW scenario imo for GW2
[2023-01-09 10:07:55] <%Mordwyl> What will be interesting is the masteries
[2023-01-09 10:08:02] <alwiro> how do you feel about the graphics?
[2023-01-09 10:08:03] <%+axel310> GW1 is just superior to GW2. Sad that it changed so much from the original game
[2023-01-09 10:08:04] <%Cara1977> Hi Chris
[2023-01-09 10:08:11] <+Khellendross> actually I'm happy to say that the zones generally get better and better. Especially outside of the base game. In many ways its suffers from similar issues to FFXIV ARR
[2023-01-09 10:08:12] <%NomadHook> IMO One thing that I think you miss out by playing revenent first is that you don't get to experiment with Utility Skills as much as other classes
[2023-01-09 10:08:13] <noriken> @axel310 hard this.
[2023-01-09 10:08:14] <basic94> @axel310 ^
[2023-01-09 10:08:15] <%+avenlaya1> no
[2023-01-09 10:08:16] <%beskarsilver> Base Game was fine for the time it came out but it's rough now
[2023-01-09 10:08:18] <Exfr> Yes
[2023-01-09 10:08:19] <%+Drathas> no
[2023-01-09 10:08:19] <%Vinestra28> No
[2023-01-09 10:08:21] <+fenriwow> not really
[2023-01-09 10:08:22] <Exfr> It got worse
[2023-01-09 10:08:24] <%Farstrider__> Not really
[2023-01-09 10:08:24] <BaronSolace> @axel310 no it isnt, take your rose tinted glasses off lol
[2023-01-09 10:08:24] <x00p> Thoughts on the combat and weapon base ability switching?
[2023-01-09 10:08:25] <%Mordwyl> @cacklewood Except Maguuma Jungle, Heart of Thorns can burn
[2023-01-09 10:08:25] <%Quickfirex4> no
[2023-01-09 10:08:26] <%+lalandir> They dumbed down the early levels
[2023-01-09 10:08:27] <%+Geri_0123> Yes, they added the achievements, which speeds it up
[2023-01-09 10:08:27] <foodrepublic> nope
[2023-01-09 10:08:27] <Mnevea> Small changes, nothing massive though
[2023-01-09 10:08:28] <%Vinestra28> As was n slightly worse
[2023-01-09 10:08:29] <+SHENVAI> they did
[2023-01-09 10:08:36] <pyrix0> More or less, though some improvements are there.
[2023-01-09 10:08:36] <%+Sphexator> They ask you to boost for a reason
[2023-01-09 10:08:38] <+Falexx> other than mounts and login rewards, it's the same as 2012
[2023-01-09 10:08:38] <%+Awerlu> At least they fixed LW Season 1
[2023-01-09 10:08:40] <eternalyak> they make it easer or ppl just better now
[2023-01-09 10:08:41] <+scoob79> The skill system is way better now.
[2023-01-09 10:08:44] <Sermenator> very little changes
[2023-01-09 10:08:46] <+scoob79> The original skill system was awful.
[2023-01-09 10:08:48] <%Ghoulishdivide> the personal story in GW2 was longer in the base game i think
[2023-01-09 10:08:49] <+Trigarta> the adventure guide is a new addition.
[2023-01-09 10:08:51] <%Puzzleface> tangled basin can go die in a fire
[2023-01-09 10:08:52] <shaddy42> they dont have time to update start game, its a small team
[2023-01-09 10:08:53] <%turtleandfish> @axel310 do you have any sources as to why? genuine question as i have not played gw1 before
[2023-01-09 10:08:58] <noriken> @axel310 i've actually gone back to play gw1 recently and it's still better than gw2
[2023-01-09 10:09:01] <+JokeyBoy88> They improved starter area world bosses, also gives u the rapter mount to start off with

[2023-01-09 10:09:09] <Henezzi> well you had no mount when GW launched
[2023-01-09 10:09:09] <Mnevea> An example would be those helmets that you got spammed with. those weren't there at launch

[2023-01-09 10:09:33] <%+Geri_0123> The game powercrept a lot, a leveling group back then was much weaker
[2023-01-09 10:09:35] <+kalamari__> you could do story missions at your own pace and hadnt to wait for every 10 levels. so you could play them underleveled and have an actual challenge @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 10:09:37] <DunesGames> yeah the zones you are in now were not designed with mounts in mind

[2023-01-09 10:14:21] <%Vinestra28> @ravenribb numerous such as the asura jumping puzzle malachors leap in lions arch
[2023-01-09 10:14:21] <+Khellendross> these were much harder originally though (no mounts)
[2023-01-09 10:14:22] <zikaxu> Please stop killing raptors like yoshi
[2023-01-09 10:14:31] <%$Azikielboi> hows your class/rotation been @Preachlfw ?
[2023-01-09 10:14:32] <+tyrew0rm> You should try getting vistas without the mount, as when then came out there was no mount
[2023-01-09 10:14:36] <aceexmachina0011> Core experience is actually without mounts cuz they added mounts in the 2nd expansion
[2023-01-09 10:14:37] <%turtleandfish> its not a jumping puzzle if you can see the goal PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 10:14:40] <+JokeyBoy88> Chalice of tears jumping puzzle is basically a right of passage
[2023-01-09 10:14:45] <+Khellendross> @fripple4 which one? there are three in Lion's Arch?

[2023-01-09 10:17:28] <+Khellendross> GW2's main focus is exploration. That said, the story is actually fantastic outside of Vanilla

[2023-01-09 10:17:39] <%+Sphexator> I mean you needed to do side quests before to meet the MSQ level requirement
[2023-01-09 10:17:39] <Hizirin> Tbh, GW2 after the core game kinda split their attention between the MSQ story and the open world overall
[2023-01-09 10:17:46] <%urbish_> GW2 MSQ KEKL
[2023-01-09 10:17:47] <Narangal> Core writing in GW2 is....sure something
[2023-01-09 10:17:57] <Hizirin> It just doesn't force you to do the story as much
[2023-01-09 10:18:00] <%turtleandfish> oh you mean scholasticate?

[2023-01-09 10:18:23] <%ravenribb> @Preachlfw I'm slowly clearing all quests, zone by zone, good shit

[2023-01-09 11:37:16] <+ein_sof93> @Goraka91 fair play man, probably good cos im getting a bit burned out going all in on WoW
[2023-01-09 11:37:19] <Clinona> Inventory management is so much better when you just get un-id gear that stacks. Shame that the game doesn't put its best foot forward

[2023-01-09 11:37:39] <Siggi_EMP> since you're leveling quite fast it's never that big of a loss to just mindlessly sell/salvage while leveling
[2023-01-09 11:37:56] <%+Reiyayru> Watching you play has made me jump back into GW2, setting are still there which is nice

[2023-01-09 11:40:33] <Aretiam> You mean a namazu?
[2023-01-09 11:40:33] <+NekoNura> Likely quest reward
[2023-01-09 11:40:34] <%Garfried> some of the stuff you get from levelup rewards is not salvageable for some reason
[2023-01-09 11:40:34] <+メルビン (melvinhardin)> karma items

[2023-01-09 11:40:34] <Siggi_EMP> story reward
[2023-01-09 11:40:35] <VanGherwen> Because its a Karma item
[2023-01-09 11:40:35] <%+TottWriter> Some level up rewards can't be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:40:36] <simplySouron> @Preachlfw stuff received from LvL up cannot be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:40:36] <Proz3R> if you can't salvage, just sell or destroy them
[2023-01-09 11:40:38] <Exfr> Some of that stuff is level up gear. Can't be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:40:40] <Goraka91> Some stuff is weird like that, can't sell or salvage it's a pain
[2023-01-09 11:40:41] <Proz3R> they're story rewards
[2023-01-09 11:40:41] <%+Geri_0123> It's  a story reward
[2023-01-09 11:40:42] <+tyrew0rm> Story rewards are just junk
[2023-01-09 11:40:43] <%Vinestra28> Karma /story rewards
[2023-01-09 11:40:44] <arthonn> Probably a story drop, just throw it away
[2023-01-09 11:40:44] <nattycakes85> some story items cant be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:40:44] <+Khellendross> @Lolbur what do you mean? there is plenty of visual gear progression. Or do you mean stat progression at max?
[2023-01-09 11:40:45] <+JinsTonik> Can't salvage story rewards
[2023-01-09 11:40:46] <+Rymm_> some karma items are not able to be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:40:46] <VanGherwen> and that would lead to ppl buy karma tiems and salvage them
[2023-01-09 11:40:47] <+kalamari__> you cant slavage level up gear. its to prevent bots from mass leveling @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 11:40:52] <VanGherwen> ppl gat banned for that years ago
[2023-01-09 11:40:53] <MortyQ> some items are karma items or story rewards, they don't allow you to salvage/sell for some reason
[2023-01-09 11:40:53] <+fluke1963> starter gear perhaps?
[2023-01-09 11:40:54] <+Raif89> items granted from level ups can't be salvaged @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 11:40:56] <%+avenlaya1> @Preachlfw gear you get from your level up rewards are not salvageable due to RMT
[2023-01-09 11:40:56] <skythius> you can't salvage story or level up rewards
[2023-01-09 11:40:57] <%+TottWriter> If it was accountbound when you got it, it can't always be salvaged
[2023-01-09 11:41:00] <+メルビン (melvinhardin)> It's to prevent abuse
[2023-01-09 11:41:00] <Clinona> Nah some items just wont let you sell/salvage. Usually story stuff and starter gear
[2023-01-09 11:41:04] <Hizirin> @Lolbur Probably means stat progression and no eternal carrot on a stick race
[2023-01-09 11:41:06] <%NomadHook> Some story / level up / karma bought items aren't salvageable
[2023-01-09 11:41:10] <TheresADesign> no, its just a flag some items get
[2023-01-09 11:41:10] <%+TottWriter> It's to stop people farming level up items

[2023-01-09 12:12:06] <+Franken1030> i like to go through core game first
[2023-01-09 12:12:08] <+Daurentius> @phinci base game first but exps give you a bunch of qol stuff

[2023-01-09 12:12:17] <+Raif89> @phinci there are sometimes good sales where you can get all the xpacs and base game for a low price
[2023-01-09 12:12:19] <+Franken1030> i dont even suggest get mounts first
[2023-01-09 12:12:20] <%phinci> @Daurentius such as ?
[2023-01-09 12:12:21] <ishii987> monkaHmm . o O ( FeelsDankMan )
[2023-01-09 12:12:24] <%+TottWriter> @phinci Unless you reaally want the mount, basegame first
[2023-01-09 12:12:26] <MissFrann> If you buy the first expansion you can use the mount, if you're free to play you only get to trial the mount for a couple hours. Its good if you get it for sale
[2023-01-09 12:12:26] <MortyQ> @phinci getting HoT and PoF does unlock some stuff thats locked behind the f2p wall, but play it first see if you enjoy
[2023-01-09 12:12:29] <Goraka91> Probably be overwhelmed if you start at the expansions, and they do add a mount at level 10 now instead of the second expansion
[2023-01-09 12:12:34] <%+lalandir> @phinci you may get tempted to buy the expansions to get mounts and gliders
[2023-01-09 12:12:41] <%r3db3ard95> you get a mount even with base game now
[2023-01-09 12:12:42] <+Daurentius> @phinci mounts and masteries
[2023-01-09 12:12:43] <Xyr3s> If u are unsure if u will like the game, play base game first. if u are sure u wanna try it all? buy expacs

[2023-01-09 12:28:04] <+tyrew0rm> thats a end game event, they give big XP rewards if you are below 80
[2023-01-09 12:28:07] <br0cksteady> You get rewards based on your participation, the FASTEST leveling is done through events like that
[2023-01-09 12:28:08] <+Daurentius> @Phindrius this is gw2, fashion is endgame, ppl are rolling over show up on streamers field of view PepoDance
[2023-01-09 12:28:09] <Siggi_EMP> mastery progress is xp and since masteries take loads of xp to train you get a good amount of xp instead

[2023-01-09 12:28:38] <Exfr> This is a mid level zone
[2023-01-09 12:28:40] <juicycrack> events are just crackers for exp usually
[2023-01-09 12:28:40] <wynterdream> ehhh kinda far
[2023-01-09 12:28:42] <DoctorPall> It is a Liwing world season 4 event
[2023-01-09 12:28:43] <Trafikk_> you nowhere near end game zone
[2023-01-09 12:28:43] <+Rymm_> @Daurentius these events are part of achievement and on timer, people show up for these

[2023-01-09 12:28:46] <Hizirin> Events give a lot more exp than ther stuff in game, that';s why
[2023-01-09 12:28:46] <mez_taz> some end game events are sprinkled throughout the world because of the level down
[2023-01-09 12:28:47] <juicycrack> plus that was a cracker event
[2023-01-09 12:28:47] <%+lalandir> The extra reward was probably an achievement @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 12:28:47] <dddmitri> it was one of the events added later in game, mostly for lvl 80 players
[2023-01-09 12:28:49] <frume13> still leveling zone, but there are achievements in these zones that give ton of experience.
[2023-01-09 12:28:50] <+NekoNura> 1-80 in GW2 is basically tutorial, you get to max super fast

[2023-01-09 12:36:50] <Goraka91> @0rektquiem Think around the time of the Steam release they revisited the starting zone world bosses
[2023-01-09 12:36:54] <trixo_zawun> @yuiona don't know all the details, but probably it has something to do with what specific composition they want for the gruop, and you didn't notice or read chat
[2023-01-09 12:36:57] <%Shelana95> This is it

[2023-01-09 12:38:56] <PephDrood> The world boss events will start at 12:45 @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 12:39:01] <Wildonfire> GW 2 have mega servers so it does not matter what you pick for pve
[2023-01-09 12:39:02] <+Rymm_> it should be even more fun with less people

[2023-01-09 12:41:18] <Goraka91> Mounts were added with the 2nd expansion Path of Fire

[2023-01-09 12:41:28] <parmi_reggiano> @Preachlfw Good luck with everything with the studio. Sorry if I shoudn't have reminded you.
[2023-01-09 12:41:30] <jrkchoylin> griffon grind
[2023-01-09 12:41:31] <Trafikk_> Mounts and Mount Masteries were post 80 content.... PoF expansion
[2023-01-09 12:41:31] <+danhideintree> Just a lil LUL Still Felt super rewarding getting something like skyscale
[2023-01-09 12:41:32] <frume13> wow copied the flying mounts, smushing them together and dropping any drawbacks on them.
[2023-01-09 12:41:32] <EndingWonderland> you can play the entirety of the base game of gw2 for free on steam btw
[2023-01-09 12:41:33] <Goraka91> @0rektquiem NODDERS
[2023-01-09 12:41:34] <kalameesjr> even raptor was originally a path of fire mount but they added it to base game

[2023-01-09 12:49:03] <%spiritXC> still has to work on the red circle concept ^^
[2023-01-09 12:49:07] <Boktoshlive> I havent been around for a bit what happened to mr Fingle?
[2023-01-09 12:49:08] <%blackhawk_brian> What does "backseat" mean
[2023-01-09 12:49:10] <%+lalandir> Hit box is jank on this one sadly
[2023-01-09 12:49:15] <tudjetetke> this was my first world boss way back ^^
[2023-01-09 12:49:18] <Goraka91> Might makes me right POOGERS
[2023-01-09 12:49:19] <%+lalandir> But maybe the Shatterer PauseChamp
[2023-01-09 12:49:22] <br0cksteady> The hitbox doesn't suck? stand in the green circle, target boss, hit boss? even with melee
[2023-01-09 12:49:44] <numinuminumnumnum> @vydos They're very opposites, except the more focus on story, FF14 is probs the worst zone gameplay, but has strengths in other places, whilst GW2's zones are unmatched but instanced is below WoW and FF14 imo

[2023-01-09 12:49:50] <0rektquiem> @RiMi0n I mean, rev is good too! You can just try both classes and check how both classes play in the pvp lobby (pvp scales you to 80 and all skills/specs unlocked) and decide from there @RiMi0n
[2023-01-09 12:49:57] <+NekoNura> Thats where his hotbox is
[2023-01-09 12:49:59] <goatman92> Wow this mustve been a buff to world bosses. I remember it took much less time to kill SB

[2023-01-09 12:50:03] <sirsmokealott2> Man these world boss fights look more epic than in WoW

[2023-01-09 12:50:24] <jcm2606> @goatman92 they recently went back and overhauled some of the starter zone bosses
[2023-01-09 12:50:24] <+kalamari__> @goatman92 they overhauled the starter area WB before EoD release
[2023-01-09 12:50:24] <Goraka91> @goatman92 Updated the start zone ones around Steam release, jungle worm is no joke
[2023-01-09 12:50:25] <+NekoNura> Need some water eles

[2023-01-09 12:50:40] <DoctorPall> @goatman92 yeah they added mechanics to him and shaman. and bumped up the HP
[2023-01-09 12:50:42] <%+lalandir> I hate the in out hit box of this, every other starter zone boss is better
[2023-01-09 12:50:51] <+RiMi0n> @0rektquiem ok thx :3
[2023-01-09 12:50:55] <+NekoNura> The swamp distorts the AOE markers in this one
[2023-01-09 12:51:23] <chris898> How are you finding Gw2? I played it when it first launched.
[2023-01-09 12:51:25] <+Daurentius> @goatman92 shaman is true gw2 endgame

[2023-01-09 12:51:42] <+Mackemm73> GW2 is very much about stacking and sharing buffs, heals. Better to be in the group though
[2023-01-09 12:51:42] <wynterdream> just follow commander

[2023-01-09 12:52:16] <numinuminumnumnum> Shadow Behemoth probs the most meh world boss despite how cool it looks, all you do is bash head, run around bash portals, rinse and repeat
[2023-01-09 12:52:19] <swtk_> rule of thumb is to stack on the guy with the marker above his head
[2023-01-09 12:52:21] <%ninzx> does he know what a commander tag is?

[2023-01-09 12:55:22] <Azphelle> @numinuminumnumnum @plummleys1 oh! really? I haven't touched the game since HoT so I'll prob have quite a bit haha
[2023-01-09 12:55:23] <Skyle4f> They get way better as you go in to living world and expansions
[2023-01-09 12:55:23] <Hizirin> The AoE was distorted due to water, yah, but overall you need practice with recognizing danger
[2023-01-09 12:55:23] <%+YuushaEX> yeah i couldn't see what the heck was going on either
[2023-01-09 12:55:24] <ishreku1v1m8> do the sunless Pog
[2023-01-09 12:55:25] <numinuminumnumnum> This world boss is one of the most lackluster ones anyway
[2023-01-09 12:55:29] <+Daurentius> i think youre dying to dmg

[2023-01-09 12:55:57] <+plummleys1> it is the beginner world boss.. the others are way better
[2023-01-09 12:55:59] <%+TottWriter> It's a nice contrast tho. As one of the more underwhelming mechanically, it's still a good spectacle to start with
[2023-01-09 12:55:59] <%urbish_> wow mechanics are an absolute shitshow for new players too tbh
[2023-01-09 12:55:59] <MortyQ> @korgir you can type "/wiki et" in game and it brings up the page
[2023-01-09 12:56:03] <numinuminumnumnum> @Azphelle For sure! Try recovering it, will likely have a fair few bday gifts to loot with dyes, cosmetics and prestige stuff
[2023-01-09 12:56:07] <+Razzin_> its just world boss in starter zone
[2023-01-09 12:56:11] <0rektquiem> @baggytrousers cant wait for mike to get into HoT and explore the zones. Would be fun to watch him run around without mounts PepeLaugh @baggytrousers

[2023-01-09 13:01:04] <numinuminumnumnum> JP are quite hidden
[2023-01-09 13:01:05] <MonoSteeps> they don't count to map completion, yes haha
[2023-01-09 13:01:07] <+NekoNura> There are some JPs that dont count towards map completion cause theyre too hard
[2023-01-09 13:01:09] <%ArroArroArro> has he tested weapon swapping?
[2023-01-09 13:01:09] <%+ephetic> jumping puzzles are completely optional, don't need them for map completion.
[2023-01-09 13:01:14] <%+TottWriter> It's almost impossible to actually 100% a zone. there are so many events you'll miss playing through
[2023-01-09 13:01:18] <+Zilwer11> There's more to zones than 100%ing them
[2023-01-09 13:01:22] <MrSvenja> Not all the maps, but a very good majority of them, and yeah, some are well hidden
[2023-01-09 13:01:22] <IkkisFTW> I think there is like 4 JPs in this zone

[2023-01-09 13:01:47] <Trafikk_> they are NOT part of Map completetion because a huge amount of people would never complete maps cos the JP's are to tough for them :P

[2023-01-09 13:04:40] <numinuminumnumnum> @Khellendross Plenty of times, it's not so bad after a while, it's one of the best though, the new LA JP though just has some bits where you can fall off easily despite jumping the right way, things not lining up
[2023-01-09 13:04:43] <Goraka91> @Clinona PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 13:04:47] <Siggi_EMP> you just happen to do a quest from a whisper agent, not specific to your story

[2023-01-09 13:07:44] <%+berked07> hey guys
[2023-01-09 13:07:48] <Hjolt> since some time in GW2 leveling became easy. but it used to be at the phase of old SWTOR. like it was REAL slow
[2023-01-09 13:07:50] <%+silimaur> I have levelled from 1-80 in 3-4 hours BEFORE they added the adventure guide that made it a lot faster ^^
[2023-01-09 13:07:54] <korgir> getting 100% map completion record is around 12 hours, you willl get max lvl way before 100%

[2023-01-09 13:08:23] <%+silimaur> @MolotovN level 80
[2023-01-09 13:08:23] <homeless_hom> gw2 lets you mount before doing the expansions now?
[2023-01-09 13:08:24] <juicycrack> @MolotovN not for a while

[2023-01-09 13:08:40] <twinspirit> @homeless_hom Surprised me too tbh
[2023-01-09 13:08:41] <jrkchoylin> every world boss usually has pre events to do before it actually spawns, so you have time when it happens
[2023-01-09 13:08:42] <Exfr> @MolotovN Whenever he hits level 80
[2023-01-09 13:08:48] <Jakazin> @Hjolt it took me 4 days to 1-80 on gw2 release back in 2012, that's not slow imo
[2023-01-09 13:08:49] <山姆甜甜 (samsweety)> 10  it's trial mount tho
[2023-01-09 13:08:50] <hal2210> if you have pof, they give the raptor
[2023-01-09 13:08:53] <IkkisFTW> ye, they made it so you get the raptor in erozea
[2023-01-09 13:08:56] <jcm2606> @homeless_hom yep, once you get to level 10 or a multiple of 10. you can also get a 10 hour trial of the raptor if you're on a F2P account
[2023-01-09 13:08:57] <shivr__> why does his mount look like a Piñata
[2023-01-09 13:08:57] <Goraka91> Premium accounts now get the raptor at level 10 instead of in the second expansion ye
[2023-01-09 13:08:58] <+wabberjacks> best money spent in this game was world boss portal device
[2023-01-09 13:09:02] <+Razzin_> @homeless_hom smart they did that
[2023-01-09 13:09:04] <MrSvenja> Giving the raptor for new player is a really good idea. This ease the journey
[2023-01-09 13:09:08] <Raeba> has he met a certain apple vendor yet?

[2023-01-09 13:09:27] <homeless_hom> huh, that's nice you don't have to play the whole base game and expansion just to mount now

[2023-01-09 13:10:23] <%NomadHook> @Goraka91 You need to own an expansion, then it is no longer a trial (10 hour trial for people without expacs)

[2023-01-09 13:10:29] <TheresADesign> you can let the event fail for a different boss

[2023-01-09 13:12:49] <jcm2606> @TottWriter plus he has access to map chat, plus he has unrestricted access to the trading post, plus he has 4 bag slots instead of 2, plus he has 5 character slots instead of 2 LUL the F2P is extremely generous, but there's more to the F2P account than just not having permanent access to the raptor
[2023-01-09 13:12:59] <+khazroi> GW2 combat is 3/10

[2023-01-09 13:13:13] <Goraka91> @0rektquiem Yeah he's done Elder Scrolls since...Morrowind or Oblivion, he did the main theme, both Guild Wars too
[2023-01-09 13:13:21] <Venkix> maps and environment are GW2s strong point imo

[2023-01-09 13:13:39] <%+TottWriter> @jcm2606 that's very true. I was mainly referring to what people can see onstream at the moment, but yeah. F2P definitely has its limitations

[2023-01-09 13:13:50] <juicycrack> @khazroi I mean when the mobs dont encourage you to try in the open world sure just spam 1 but there is nuance
[2023-01-09 13:13:50] <%0rektquiem> @Goraka91 that explains it lol @Goraka91
[2023-01-09 13:13:54] <+NekoNura> @hal2210 Ending was shit sure, but the whole invasion stuff was cool
[2023-01-09 13:13:54] <Exfr> Dynamic events NODDERS

[2023-01-09 13:14:02] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> @hal2210 I think the overall story is ok, but the narrative is so disjointed it kinda makes no sense
[2023-01-09 13:14:06] <IkkisFTW> world bosses are cool in this game
[2023-01-09 13:14:10] <Goraka91> @0rektquiem Like the song right now is just "Skyrim cave ambience" KEKW
[2023-01-09 13:14:10] <+NekoNura> Yea, GW2 maps is alive AF
[2023-01-09 13:14:13] <+Morkid> Everything is a World Quest
[2023-01-09 13:14:22] <ItsMeSaaj> core game is so far behind expansion content, in every aspect
[2023-01-09 13:14:25] <Marathay> Yes world events have its own stories in gw2 :D
[2023-01-09 13:14:27] <+khazroi> how did you make the old graphics like look this
[2023-01-09 13:14:28] <MrAJLaycock> Huh. Sounds good.

[2023-01-09 13:14:30] <+NekoNura> GW2 is a completionists wet dream
[2023-01-09 13:14:35] <Svenwm> YES many
[2023-01-09 13:14:36] <sirsmokealott2> Are still on the base game or is this one of the expansions?
[2023-01-09 13:14:37] <MrSvenja> @khazroi Hmhm, For me GW2 combat is really really good, very deep with the combo field system, sadly, very few people know of it and stick to spam 1
[2023-01-09 13:14:38] <hal2210> i mean orr was 3 maps of current day meta events, it was cool at the time

[2023-01-09 13:14:47] <山姆甜甜 (samsweety)> @NekoNura or nightmare  KEKW
[2023-01-09 13:14:48] <homeless_hom> I adore the leveling experience in gw2. Leveling by exploring the map is such a great design choice
[2023-01-09 13:14:48] <%0rektquiem> I like GW2's combat better than WoW's and FFXIV. This game also does open world the best in the genre imo
[2023-01-09 13:14:50] <numinuminumnumnum> I remember playing the core game before first xpac and way after several years saw new events I'd never seen
[2023-01-09 13:14:52] <Wanya2007> @sirsmokealott2 still base game
[2023-01-09 13:14:53] <%+silimaur> @khazroi what do you mean?
[2023-01-09 13:14:57] <Frozenruin> Is it not similar to Fates in FF?
[2023-01-09 13:15:02] <+SparcoGreddy> Don't think we have number of events per zones, but someone could count the events on the wiki per zone :D
[2023-01-09 13:15:02] <Trafikk_> they are all dynamic as you wander around the world
[2023-01-09 13:15:04] <sirsmokealott2> cool
[2023-01-09 13:15:04] <%+khlarain> The living world chapters being behind gem purchases really fucks the story over. Only reason I didn't just binge the story.
[2023-01-09 13:15:06] <+Razzin_> props to devs for not going the WoW clone route
[2023-01-09 13:15:07] <%+silimaur> nah, fates are meh
[2023-01-09 13:15:08] <+wabberjacks> base game,expansions happen at 80
[2023-01-09 13:15:08] <%+TottWriter> It's also worth bearing in mind that once you hit 80, the story starts to have a much bigger role in what you're doing
[2023-01-09 13:15:11] <+Morkid> @Preachlfw IIRC there's achievements for doing everything in a zone, so you can see exactly what events are possible
[2023-01-09 13:15:15] <+NekoNura> @Frozenruin Similar but much more integrated into the world
[2023-01-09 13:15:15] <Dinshu> its an expansion and refinement of the world quest system from Warhammer Online
[2023-01-09 13:15:17] <+Farmoure> have you done dragon on this zone yet?
[2023-01-09 13:15:21] <%JakeZGR> Might makes me right NODDERS
[2023-01-09 13:15:25] <datNovazGG> What class are you playing?
[2023-01-09 13:15:28] <Goraka91> @khlarain Yeah no idea why they did that
[2023-01-09 13:15:33] <MrSvenja> @Frozenruin In a way; GW2 does this better tho
[2023-01-09 13:15:35] <%ilandra> @frozenruin it has more variety than ff, but very similar, and it has followups much more often
[2023-01-09 13:15:36] <+kalamari__> @Farmoure he plans to
[2023-01-09 13:15:37] <%FrenchFraies> I like the freedom to level however you like
[2023-01-09 13:15:37] <jcm2606> @datNovazGG Revenant
[2023-01-09 13:15:38] <Vallun> quests are either through ambient events or hiden away in achievement panel, which takes some getting used to, the quests are there but not how most people traditionally think of them
[2023-01-09 13:15:43] <hal2210> older maps are MUCH better
[2023-01-09 13:15:47] <+NekoNura> @Goraka91 Cause they dont have a sub
[2023-01-09 13:15:47] <hal2210> err
[2023-01-09 13:15:48] <homeless_hom> @khlarain They give them out for free now pretty frequently. I got all of them for free a year ago or something just by logging in
[2023-01-09 13:15:54] <hal2210> newer maps in expansions
[2023-01-09 13:15:57] <+khazroi> tab target oh boy, auto combat AND tab target.....why bother play
[2023-01-09 13:15:58] <%0rektquiem> @Frozenruin it's *kinda* similar but leagues better. my only gripe with this game is the story. it's decent but lackluster compared to ffxiv's. I'd say it's in between WoW and FFXIV in that aspect
[2023-01-09 13:15:59] <ishreku1v1m8> is he high enough level for the sunless? Pog

[2023-01-09 13:16:12] <+wabberjacks> return to achievements really brought people back to older maps. makes it feel more alive

[2023-01-09 13:16:13] <Siggi_EMP> when there is a new expac or living story release you will find people running around at msq points a lot though

[2023-01-09 13:16:30] <Exfr> @Frozenruin Pretty much. Fates were FFXIV's take on dynamic events. Like how GW2's strike missions are the GW2 take on FFXIV Trials
[2023-01-09 13:16:31] <+Nevarato> this is still content that's 10 years old
[2023-01-09 13:16:33] <+NekoNura> Oh yea, action combat is a million times better
[2023-01-09 13:16:34] <trixo_zawun> and free content for new accounts
[2023-01-09 13:16:36] <+Rymm_> it changed a lot
[2023-01-09 13:16:37] <%KelticNight> well new players don't get a mount for more than 10 hours unless they buy an expansion first LUL
[2023-01-09 13:16:37] <+Daurentius> yep yourye playing 12yrs old content still
[2023-01-09 13:16:37] <+NekoNura> Has Mike tried action combat?
[2023-01-09 13:16:37] <%$Chirriu> Afternoon everyone
[2023-01-09 13:16:38] <numinuminumnumnum> @Frozenruin Fates are like an alpha version of what events in GW2 are, which are way ahead, more akin to what Blizzard did in Dragonflight with their assault on the keep or soup, there's a lot of events like that in GW2
[2023-01-09 13:16:40] <%+whimsicaleel> hot was brutal
[2023-01-09 13:16:41] <@%Methuzahla> Any zones in particular you want to look at number of mini events for @Preachlfw ?
[2023-01-09 13:16:44] <Velkoman> I would say filling the 'hearts' are the quests
[2023-01-09 13:16:44] <TheOmniSora> and many items still relevant
[2023-01-09 13:16:45] <FattyPorker> good point

[2023-01-09 13:16:51] <+bullard1> GW2 comes into its own at level 80
[2023-01-09 13:16:51] <%SRompery> Giving mounts were a big thing NOTED
[2023-01-09 13:16:51] <Trafikk_> you are just Doing GW" Vanilla... the original levelling Zones from launch... you not been anywhere near the expansions yet
[2023-01-09 13:16:52] <Lithii> Waiting for Mike vs Pocket Raptors Kappa
[2023-01-09 13:16:54] <%+TottWriter> @khazroi Only your first skill will autoattack when you start combat, the rest you have to do manually. it's not much different to base autoattacks in other games
[2023-01-09 13:16:57] <homeless_hom> The base game is still quite charming even after all these years
[2023-01-09 13:16:58] <Raqi_> yeah, questing is pretty much exploration based rather than moving on a well-trodden path
[2023-01-09 13:16:59] <%+DerZanael> @Preachlfw are you waiting a week for msq this time for XIV ?
[2023-01-09 13:16:59] <Hizirin> HoT definitely was brutal for core gamers
[2023-01-09 13:16:59] <swtk_> difficulty KEKW
[2023-01-09 13:16:59] <MortyQ> HoT maps are some of the most amazing mmo experience for me
[2023-01-09 13:17:01] <Venkix> Heart of Thorns zones fucked you up. LUL
[2023-01-09 13:17:01] <%JakeZGR> Shelana95 mopHug
[2023-01-09 13:17:04] <+khazroi> if they upgrade the engine to UE5, this game would be the top mmo
[2023-01-09 13:17:05] <hal2210> dry top KEKL
[2023-01-09 13:17:06] <Jakazin> HoT was a huge difficulty spike
[2023-01-09 13:17:07] <Kazeau> huge difference
[2023-01-09 13:17:09] <+Trigarta> They learned a lot. The expansions get better and better.
[2023-01-09 13:17:12] <%Shelana95> @JakeZGR  Eya :D
[2023-01-09 13:17:13] <Siggi_EMP> you really start seeing a greater shift in hot, some smaller differences in living story
[2023-01-09 13:17:13] <Frozenruin> Gotcha thank you guys !
[2023-01-09 13:17:13] <juicycrack> HoT is wacko mode
[2023-01-09 13:17:15] <+Nevarato> HoT maps are so overwhelming for new players
[2023-01-09 13:17:16] <%ilandra> @methuzahla I think wiki lists all events for each zone
[2023-01-09 13:17:19] <MrSvenja> Yeah, HoT difficulty spike is very steep
[2023-01-09 13:17:23] <%JakeZGR> ilandra mopHug mopHug
[2023-01-09 13:17:23] <FrizzGrim> I remember the first time I stepped into HOT and I got my face ripped off
[2023-01-09 13:17:24] <Wanya2007> the first expansion blow everyones mind
[2023-01-09 13:17:24] <ishreku1v1m8> @khazroi is that even possible?
[2023-01-09 13:17:25] <yuiona> @Frozenruin kinda but also not. Events in gw2 are a lot more abundant and they can be chained into small side stories. Sometimes up to 5-7 events chain one after the other to achieve an overarching goal. you will be bombarded with events everywhere you go which makes the world feel much more alive
[2023-01-09 13:17:25] <kalameesjr> hot without skyscale LUL
[2023-01-09 13:17:27] <%+Captain_Papaya> HoT making people quit the game OMEGALUL
[2023-01-09 13:17:28] <%XRay2x> you know what I really can't wait, I can't wait for Mike to get to Sparkly Fen, considering how much of a piss he took when he heard the name of the zone back in the day during drama time KEKW
[2023-01-09 13:17:31] <ocio188> fractals
[2023-01-09 13:17:31] <IkkisFTW> Heart of thorns was tuned for people that had done it all KEKL
[2023-01-09 13:17:32] <numinuminumnumnum> HoT maps are so cool if you can get your whole Guild to try and complete a map during major events and get to the last boss
[2023-01-09 13:17:33] <%nexotar> @Preachlfw even if your current msq doesn't appeal to you, i'd encourage you to check out the later stuff. imo it becomes way better in the expansions
[2023-01-09 13:17:33] <hal2210> HoT is monkaOMEGA
[2023-01-09 13:17:35] <%+silimaur> replaced dungeons with fractals... which are dungeons :D
[2023-01-09 13:17:35] <TheresADesign> HoT maps are god tier
[2023-01-09 13:17:35] <lightriver29> Yeah HoT maps aren't as hard as when they came out now, but the spike was insane
[2023-01-09 13:17:38] <%rocthenite> the first expantion is a massive difacultly hike in term of turverus and combat
[2023-01-09 13:17:38] <+KlosterKatten> i hate HoT because everything is dependent on people being around
[2023-01-09 13:17:38] <Trafikk_> you are doing ARR...base game pre Heavensward
[2023-01-09 13:17:38] <%ilandra> @jakezgr hi! How are ya doin?
[2023-01-09 13:17:38] <swtk_> even at around level 80 mobs will cc u and stuff if u dont roll correctly
[2023-01-09 13:17:40] <secretskritt> HoT got nerfed it was too "hard"
[2023-01-09 13:17:40] <+Daurentius> gw2 first exp waaay more of an update that lets say either tbc or wotlk to wow
[2023-01-09 13:17:43] <+Franken1030> you got a mount thats not happened until second expansions
[2023-01-09 13:17:44] <%+enikma_> No healers PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 13:17:45] <+Razzin_> there is healer role in raids
[2023-01-09 13:17:45] <KaisenSiru> WHAT?!
[2023-01-09 13:17:46] <+Nevarato> there's a soft trinity
[2023-01-09 13:17:47] <+MsBungle> well there is one thing he has that wasn't base game - a mount
[2023-01-09 13:17:47] <MissFrann> There is now, sadly
[2023-01-09 13:17:49] <ishreku1v1m8> path of fire zones Pog
[2023-01-09 13:17:49] <Vallun> the trinity exists in end game pretty much
[2023-01-09 13:17:49] <xLeopanther> err.. depending on the content. there are healers, and in some raids there's tanks.
[2023-01-09 13:17:52] <%+whimsicaleel> there are healers
[2023-01-09 13:17:54] <Slamdzr> only in raids really
[2023-01-09 13:17:55] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> @Frozenruin and the most important thing that many events end up as a part of meta event. the last one from EoD is basically open world raid/trial style with a massive preparation phase
[2023-01-09 13:17:55] <Eadine> PepeLaugh el no sabe
[2023-01-09 13:17:56] <%+TottWriter> The biggest change is that they added dedicated healing roles, but tanking is still pretty different
[2023-01-09 13:17:58] <+KlosterKatten> the power creep of mobs is not amusing
[2023-01-09 13:17:58] <+bullard1> They have fractals which was basically the inspiration for WoW's mythics
[2023-01-09 13:17:59] <%+silimaur> raids still have tanks and healers in some of the content
[2023-01-09 13:17:59] VIEWERS: 3 107
[2023-01-09 13:18:00] <MrSvenja> Soft trinity yeah, Tanky/Support/dps
[2023-01-09 13:18:01] <+Coots_> Anet does not learn, they just do different things :P
[2023-01-09 13:18:02] <+khazroi> no holy trinity? no wonder they cannot have real raids and dungeons
[2023-01-09 13:18:03] <Goraka91> They tried to jury rig in specs that do those jobs, but eh
[2023-01-09 13:18:03] <Bleechyboy> in raids yes there are healers
[2023-01-09 13:18:05] <+Mackemm73> They have really good zone meta events at max level
[2023-01-09 13:18:06] <Siggi_EMP> well no, they very much exist but it's not generally mandatory
[2023-01-09 13:18:06] <secretskritt> holy trinity is dogshit anyways
[2023-01-09 13:18:06] <lutamate> no trinity for sure PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 13:18:06] <ItsMeSaaj> after level 80, you work togetehr a lot more, adn have clearer roles
[2023-01-09 13:18:13] <%0rektquiem> @MortyQ I have a love and hate relationship with HoT lol. I played it before mounts so it can get a bit frustrating at times. But the sense of accomplishment for getting to the place you want to get to is really nice
[2023-01-09 13:18:13] <%+silimaur> @khazroi it does
[2023-01-09 13:18:15] <+khazroi> no vertical progression either
[2023-01-09 13:18:18] <+vydos> He means that there's no real mandated trinity in dungeons.
[2023-01-09 13:18:19] <MrSvenja> @khazroi Oh sweet soul, it does
[2023-01-09 13:18:22] <wynterdream> in raids there's tanks, healers, support dps (like BRD, DBC)
[2023-01-09 13:18:22] <Shaklug> worked so well they implemented the trinity
[2023-01-09 13:18:22] <%Shelana95> You can also just Boost
[2023-01-09 13:18:23] <%+Xanctius> There is real raids and there is a soft trinity with healers and such
[2023-01-09 13:18:27] <%Shelana95> and skipp lvling
[2023-01-09 13:18:27] <wynterdream> DNC*
[2023-01-09 13:18:30] <Abraca_Dave> when I played this years ago there was nothing but pvp in the end game so got quite boring quickly
[2023-01-09 13:18:31] <%ninzx> everything is scaled...except doorframes
[2023-01-09 13:18:31] <+NekoNura> GW2 doesnt use gear treadmill so once you hit 80, the gear you get lasts forever
[2023-01-09 13:18:32] <roadroller_dah> @khazroi thats not really the main reason, osrs has raids and doesnt have that either
[2023-01-09 13:18:33] <Dinshu> @Preachlfw its more of a loose Trinity really. You still have the guy who takes all the aggro and the guy whose the dedicated healer
[2023-01-09 13:18:33] <Vasciras> is there an overarching story?
[2023-01-09 13:18:34] <kalameesjr> tangled depths alone made me uninstall gw2 some 3 times Keepo
[2023-01-09 13:18:35] <%KelticNight> NOTED Blazing Saddles
[2023-01-09 13:18:35] <+KlosterKatten> no vertical progression but anet still makes mobs hit harder and have more health PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 13:18:36] <Alski_> @khazroi other games have done it just fine on smaller scale (like 10 players or less)
[2023-01-09 13:18:37] <Exfr> @khazroi What makes the raids not real?
[2023-01-09 13:18:40] <IkkisFTW> ye, trinity actually is semi present in end game content
[2023-01-09 13:18:42] <%+TottWriter> GW2 focuses on support and control instead of just theal and tank
[2023-01-09 13:18:43] <scurissimo> Has he tried increasing the foov?
[2023-01-09 13:18:50] <MissFrann> Something pretty fun that they do is that there's huge material sinks for every level of material
[2023-01-09 13:18:52] <yuiona> In raids there are certain roles in the group but not the usual trinity of tank healer dps. Its more like this guy provides this buff, the other guy another buff, the third guy does healing while providing buff or another guy does dps while providing a buff
[2023-01-09 13:18:56] <ishreku1v1m8> all zones are level appropriate id say
[2023-01-09 13:18:56] <leopoldshark> SMOrc
[2023-01-09 13:18:58] <MissFrann> So going to an old zone still has good value
[2023-01-09 13:18:59] <+Nevarato> exp gain is percentage based, so u can level anywhere in the game, even starter zone

[2023-01-09 13:19:17] <MrSvenja> @vydos Yeah, roles in GW2 are different, We more talking about Support builds with specific buffs, like Alacrity of Quickness and straight up heals
[2023-01-09 13:19:18] <Hizirin> @0rektquiem oh yes xD
[2023-01-09 13:19:18] <positive_ions> more chickens
[2023-01-09 13:19:18] <%+MisterFinch> It may take Mike a couple of weeks to finish the map... the Core game map.
[2023-01-09 13:19:19] <Vallun> its actually quite interesting because the trinity isnt mandatory, but it is often the most optimal way to play the game, you could beat a fight with a tank or you could beat the fight with a split strategy instead, lots more diversity
[2023-01-09 13:19:19] <Moonraymurray> I thought max level was like 20 so it only trakes a day
[2023-01-09 13:19:19] <juicycrack> @khazroi great, love to hear it
[2023-01-09 13:19:22] <Venkix> exploration is this game's strong point. there are a lot of nooks and crannies with hidden paths

[2023-01-09 13:20:44] <Eadine> i think it would make sense to show off new features for games you have already played before but not for something you havent touched

[2023-01-09 13:21:33] <%0rektquiem> @TottWriter lmao Josh Hayes on his GW2 videos is hilarious
[2023-01-09 13:21:35] <brucemalt> If it's a good game, that should always work. Not going for that shows a lack of confidence, imo.
[2023-01-09 13:21:35] <Pongopygmaeous> never played this game is it worth it? i love mmos
[2023-01-09 13:21:36] <+NekoNura> @khazroi The game does have a non-tab target mode
[2023-01-09 13:21:47] <MissFrann> @KroniclyLazy there's egregiously expensive shiny skins
[2023-01-09 13:21:47] <Zyntrexx> @Pongopygmaeous 100% worth
[2023-01-09 13:21:47] <+emperaw94> Holy shit 3k followers? perhaps very uninformed question @preachlfw but who are you? like are you known for another game? I've legit never seen/ heard of you before

[2023-01-09 13:22:04] <Wanya2007> if want to play gw2 for longer you could apply for anet partner so you get a cut from sold games
[2023-01-09 13:22:07] <%+silimaur> no sub fee and the base game is unlimited free to play tria; so no reason not to try it

[2023-01-09 13:22:28] <ItsMeSaaj> @KroniclyLazy well while gear is static, legendary gear, is super convenient causde of the stat swapping, and getting all legendary gear takes quite some time, so it's not like you'll be done in two month
[2023-01-09 13:22:28] <%0rektquiem> @Pongopygmaeous worth it tbh. should try it, lots of content in f2p and if you buy it, you own it forever so yeah lol

[2023-01-09 13:23:03] <+KroniclyLazy> @Daurentius yeah thats what I found when I played a few times. tab target games for the sake of combat isn't my thing
[2023-01-09 13:23:04] <%+TottWriter> It's a convenience cash shop, but you can also farm gold for everything in it
[2023-01-09 13:23:06] <kurtrax> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 13:23:06] <Venkix> They're not gamebreaking imo
[2023-01-09 13:23:08] <+khazroi> yeah i wouldnt waste time on this knowing there are new mmos coming in a few months with better graphics and combat
[2023-01-09 13:23:08] <Pongopygmaeous> it looks pretty cool! is preach high lvl?
[2023-01-09 13:23:09] <TheBugBaby> and ingame zones
[2023-01-09 13:23:10] <NerfYordles> It's a really fair shop tbh.
[2023-01-09 13:23:11] <%NomadHook> You can convert Gold to Gems
[2023-01-09 13:23:12] <ItsMeSaaj> everything in the shop can be bought with gold
[2023-01-09 13:23:15] <%Gerbkamp> @preachlfw  I've been replaying the base story before going into the storytelling in the living world and first expansion and I feel the storytelling problem they have is similar to FFXIV ARR.
[2023-01-09 13:23:15] <+Morkid> You can buy the currency with gold, like wow token
[2023-01-09 13:23:16] <+tureil> the cash shop isn't great because of bank slots etc, but you CAN buy it all with gold
[2023-01-09 13:23:17] <%+TottWriter> I have so many stacks of XP boosts that the game gave me lol
[2023-01-09 13:23:18] <korgir> you can convert gold -> gems
[2023-01-09 13:23:19] <juicycrack> @khazroi give me a name
[2023-01-09 13:23:19] <InvaderTakko> i dont know the game but doesnt look like leveling is a big thing in this game
[2023-01-09 13:23:19] <MortyQ> You can buy anything in the store with gold tho, so thats nice
[2023-01-09 13:23:20] <MissFrann> Most of the stuff in the cash shop is a giga scam, which I guess is shady in and of itself
[2023-01-09 13:23:20] <%epicAvendesora> @emperaw94 He was primarily known for creating WoW content and being a variety streamer. With a lot of FF14 content over the last year as well.
[2023-01-09 13:23:20] <mez_taz> @ChunkeyNinja were you guys given the Living World Chapters ? or only the expansions?
[2023-01-09 13:23:21] <+y0uwantmi> the most nonsensical thing is buying MSQ for money wtf
[2023-01-09 13:23:21] <Venkix> Pay for convenience 100%
[2023-01-09 13:23:21] <twobiggy> gem store put a sour taste in my mouth
[2023-01-09 13:23:22] <Hizirin> @KelticNight The story IS free if you play consistently
[2023-01-09 13:23:23] <%+Nepstr> Unlimited scraper etc
[2023-01-09 13:23:23] <hal2210> its the poe approach
[2023-01-09 13:23:24] <secretskritt> it has pay once play ofc it'll like that
[2023-01-09 13:23:27] <yuiona> But you can always buy gems with gold though
[2023-01-09 13:23:29] <iknowuhax> You can convert gold to gems so you can be cashless
[2023-01-09 13:23:30] <+SparcoGreddy> @Pongopygmaeous max level is 80, so he is half way there
[2023-01-09 13:23:30] <+KlosterKatten> @Bregan92 But that also means less updates, more tedious content and less quality
[2023-01-09 13:23:31] <山姆甜甜 (samsweety)> you can buy gem by using gold tho
[2023-01-09 13:23:33] <+NekoNura> @khazroi Eh, new mmos sure, but lately nothing good
[2023-01-09 13:23:36] <%0rektquiem> @KroniclyLazy @ItsMeSaaj legendary gear being account wide is really nice and is amore than a good reason to get into the legendary gear grind
[2023-01-09 13:23:37] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> @mez_taz afaik we were given all content
[2023-01-09 13:23:39] <Vallun> lots of story is gated by the gem store tbh, not the best way to provide it
[2023-01-09 13:23:42] <Skyle4f> The have exp boosters but really the exp is irrelevant. If you play for a while you get tomes of experience that can boost your characters to 80 instantly
[2023-01-09 13:23:43] <%+whimsicaleel> no gear grind also makes it more bearable
[2023-01-09 13:23:44] <+Daurentius> @Pongopygmaeous try the base game its free, if you like it get the exps, they are 100 times better than base game.
[2023-01-09 13:23:44] <MrSvenja> I buy my gems with in game gold yeah, the exchange rate is ok
[2023-01-09 13:23:44] <lightriver29> Overall I think the GW2 shop is mostly fair, but I always think there's just a little too much
[2023-01-09 13:23:46] <Dinshu> @Preachlfw you can also turn gold in the premium gem currency and vice versa
[2023-01-09 13:23:46] <jcm2606> @khazroi those new MMOs could also flop while GW2 has been around for over 10 years at this point. safer bet is GW2 LUL
[2023-01-09 13:23:48] <%KelticNight> @hizirin cool, just let me get in my time machine and go back to when I had to log in LUL
[2023-01-09 13:23:51] <+danytt> nothing in the store gives you power, its 100% convenience and cosmetics, and you can always buy the gems with ingame gold
[2023-01-09 13:23:55] <yuiona> @ChunkeyNinja also the living world seasons?
[2023-01-09 13:23:56] <Trafikk_> you can convert ingame gold to gems... so can actually buy the stuff with Gold
[2023-01-09 13:23:57] <+YoshTS> It's pay to win but the game isn't about winning LUL

[2023-01-09 13:24:22] <mez_taz> @ChunkeyNinja you should double check about the Living World Chapters (seasonal story content between expansions) Usually you don't get those if they just give you the expansions

[2023-01-09 13:25:07] <djedeleste> Tera had fun combat, but lots of problems
[2023-01-09 13:25:07] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> TERA had amazing combat
[2023-01-09 13:25:09] <+Alyassus> smart
[2023-01-09 13:25:10] <Ceomin> I mean, WoW's combat is kinda boring
[2023-01-09 13:25:10] <Eadine> Tera was pretty good around when it first went f2p but went downhill pretty fast a year or 2 later
[2023-01-09 13:25:11] <numinuminumnumnum> @khazroi GW2 is a safer one, I'd say it's in the WoW and FF14 area as one of the top 5 MMO's, it still has another xpac planned
[2023-01-09 13:25:11] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> but thats it
[2023-01-09 13:25:11] <Cirrus> Tera's action combat was pretty cool
[2023-01-09 13:25:13] <%+mobbeh> WoW removed all the BOOBA

[2023-01-09 13:26:05] <yuiona> @khazroi they introduced the mega servers in the heights of the game when it was most active. its just more convenient especially if you want to play with friends

[2023-01-09 13:26:44] <ItsMeSaaj> @iiDetrimentalAid guardian/warrior, each class gets new spec at level 80 that can completly change the gameplay, also each weapin changes the playstyle too

[2023-01-09 13:35:49] <lightriver29> Wow's combat feels the most responsive and of all Hotkey MMOs, GW2 has the most satisfying combat as long as you don't want a caster, imo
[2023-01-09 13:35:49] <+KlosterKatten> @KlosterKatten nah, ff14 is balanced, this is... not so
[2023-01-09 13:36:03] <+vydos> @Taufanxz Same here. I can objectively say that GW2 gameplay is better, more fun and engaging. But I play FFXIV

[2023-01-09 13:38:09] <Its_Tav> nice, im glad preach gave this a try. Seems a bit under represented by content creators for how good the game actually is.
[2023-01-09 13:38:09] <numinuminumnumnum> @troubletooth This. It's fun when unorganized or when you play with a friend or two, but once you get to 5 and especially above, it turns into "stack and stack combo fields" deal, you're not an individual anymore, why I don't like its WvW or raids, GW2 would've been great with character collision to avoid standing inside eachother
[2023-01-09 13:38:11] <+KlosterKatten> @Amandagray825 There was a big drama a few months back confirming devs didn't play some classes they balanced and others they played gave alot of love.
[2023-01-09 13:38:12] <yuiona> @KlosterKatten the more build options you give players the harder it is to balance out all possibilities. One good example is elementalist. They constantly go back and forth between absolute trash and brutally overpowered. they couldnt hit the mark yet because every change they make causes either all builds to fall off pretty hard or for one specific build to suddenly be overpowered af

[2023-01-09 13:38:16] <Vallun> @secretskritt  i mean compared to GW1, GW2 is not even close in customizability, being able to move your health bars and ui wherever was nice, very limited in gw2 tho

[2023-01-09 13:40:18] <MissFrann> Nah in the first game it was extremely not intended. In the prologue if you went and died to mobs repeatedly the mobs would level up and you could get an insanely slow trickle of exp for killing them

[2023-01-09 13:46:33] <vasinsavin> used to do those new character intro questlines to farm a single key
[2023-01-09 13:46:35] <MissFrann> Yeah keys are cash shop, you get one or two free every month
[2023-01-09 13:46:35] <%yashiru_> GW2 is a perfect game for anyone with even a slight ADHD going on
[2023-01-09 13:46:35] <+Leafskin> @viczz88 they drop in game but you can also buy them
[2023-01-09 13:46:35] <missysuspicy> u can get free key every week running lv 10 story
[2023-01-09 13:46:39] <+kalamari__> @viczz88 yeah, but you can find them, gethem from daily logins or from map completion
[2023-01-09 13:46:39] <wynterdream> level 10 story quest gives key once a week
[2023-01-09 13:46:40] <山姆甜甜 (samsweety)> @viczz88 yes  but you can get them ingame
[2023-01-09 13:46:41] <Wildonfire> and no you dont need it
[2023-01-09 13:46:42] <%ilandra> @viczz88 you can farm them, you can buy them .
[2023-01-09 13:46:42] <%+TottWriter> keys are just for shinies really

[2023-01-09 13:46:46] <yuiona> @viczz88 yes they are. but there are ways to get them without money.

[2023-01-09 13:46:49] <kalameesjr> the only thins worth are bag slots, permanent tools and boss teleporter Kappa

[2023-01-09 13:47:02] <Goraka91> @viczz88 Also super rare things you can get for certain story parts, a "keyfarm" involves making an alt to do level 10 story, delete and do again next week
[2023-01-09 13:47:03] <%ninzx> perma tools are awesome
[2023-01-09 13:47:03] <+DropZeBait> At least blizzard doesnt have the audacity to ask for money for services that don't require a GM to do anything, right?
[2023-01-09 13:47:05] <frankthedsigner> You can also sometimes earn keys by completing maps

[2023-01-09 13:47:16] <Exfr> You can get them very rarely from drops. Also from some story quests
[2023-01-09 13:47:22] <Siggi_EMP> you get a key from your story again soon
[2023-01-09 13:47:22] <simplySouron> 100% location can drop it and then lvl 10 and lvl 40 story gives a key
[2023-01-09 13:47:23] <%+Captain_Papaya> You get a key from the level 10 story
[2023-01-09 13:47:24] <ItsMeSaaj> level 10 story step gives you one key a week
[2023-01-09 13:47:24] <KupuHka> keys are also a reward for 10 lvl and 60 lvl story quests
[2023-01-09 13:47:27] <%ilandra> @viczz88 also you can change gold for crystals (both ways). So if you are good gold farmer you can get everything from the shop “free”

[2023-01-09 13:47:29] <%+silimaur> @DropZeBait no but they do ask you to pay every month to play a game you bought
[2023-01-09 13:47:32] <+Mackemm73> You sometimes get keys from zone completions or achievements, but not often
[2023-01-09 13:47:34] <Eadine> @DropZeBait except literally playing the game

[2023-01-09 13:47:37] <%+TottWriter> You can get them as crazy rare drops but, mainly from farming the level 10 story once a week, or a possible reward for map completio

[2023-01-09 13:49:02] <%0rektquiem> @Kyletyldesley from the showcase ive seen on the live letter, i think its gonna be really good
[2023-01-09 13:49:05] <troubletooth> Everytime people defend the gemstore. They say you can convert gold to gems. This is not a problem imo. The gems to gold is scummy though as it devaluates any achievement that can be bought with gold

[2023-01-09 13:49:26] <%Eeisal> You're playing the game just as it's supposed to be played
[2023-01-09 13:49:32] <+NekoNura> @Kyletyldesley Seems like the team is learning a lot from FF16 so likely will be amazing
[2023-01-09 13:49:36] <%+SteelfurLive> think i'll have to try this game, only MMO I own but never actually put time into
[2023-01-09 13:49:41] <+DropZeBait> @troubletooth It's like the wow token, it's the developer realizing, people will buy gold. We might as well profit from it.
[2023-01-09 13:49:48] <%+Kyletyldesley> @NekoNura Hopefully, Cant wait to see what they do :)
[2023-01-09 13:49:55] <Exfr> @sirsmokealott2 There are world bosses pretty much constantly. There's a timer up on the wiki. Grroups will train from one to the next for loot sometimes
[2023-01-09 13:49:56] <%+SteelfurLive> @troubletooth its sensible tbh
[2023-01-09 13:49:57] <wynterdream> LUL
[2023-01-09 13:49:57] <+DropZeBait> Which in my opinion, is a smart business decision

[2023-01-09 13:49:59] <+aereton> @troubletooth yeah but whales pumping their real life money into ingame gold is making it more profitable for me to convert gold into gems SeemsGood

[2023-01-09 13:50:10] <MissFrann> "people will buy gold might as well profit from it" is incredibly misleading, tbh
[2023-01-09 13:50:12] <%+silimaur> gold is just for fun stuff not for getting better at the game
[2023-01-09 13:50:13] <wynterdream> SeemsGood
[2023-01-09 13:50:14] <+slashedpiedeux> @troubletooth But there's a difference between making it fair and making it predatory
[2023-01-09 13:50:14] <numinuminumnumnum> @SteelfurLive Best MMO to get into imo if you've never played one or others don't appeal to you

[2023-01-09 13:50:25] <%+TottWriter> The thing about gold to gem is that it means that GW2 has never really had a goldselling industry
[2023-01-09 13:50:27] <yuiona> @silimaur i mean you can buy gems with gold. thats one good usage. another is legendaries
[2023-01-09 13:50:36] <+slashedpiedeux> Is Preach completing every zone?
[2023-01-09 13:50:39] <%0rektquiem> @troubletooth i always trade my gold for gems whenever smth i want is in the shop
[2023-01-09 13:50:41] <%+silimaur> @ishreku1v1m8 not for being good at the game
[2023-01-09 13:50:41] <LewdAvocado> @silimaur gold is literally the most inportant thing in the game KEKL
[2023-01-09 13:50:47] <viczz88> sounds like a scam AND racketeering lol
[2023-01-09 13:50:47] <Skyle4f> @DropZeBait Its not like wow token because you can buy gems without another person buying them and "selling them to you" through the auction house
[2023-01-09 13:50:48] <shadowfire_15> ghostly wraith or trickster demon Necromancer???
[2023-01-09 13:50:50] <%+silimaur> for fun stuff yes

[2023-01-09 13:51:02] <juicycrack> @ishreku1v1m8 I mean sure but what sorta strawman is that???
[2023-01-09 13:51:04] <+slashedpiedeux> What are his goals?
[2023-01-09 13:51:07] <daze413> we need to teach these ogres that destroying and pillaging homes is wrong... by destroying and pillaging their homes

[2023-01-09 13:51:14] <%+TottWriter> But because so many skins are on the gemstore, the biggest flexes are the things you have to ear
[2023-01-09 13:51:18] <%0rektquiem> @silimaur i mean, @silimaur has a point but it certainly is the most important thing in the game lol

[2023-01-09 13:53:55] <Skyle4f> @DropZeBait the game doesnt have a subscription AND you can convert gold to gems without anyone putting real money in any step of the transaction. My issue is that the gem store skins are better in most cases that what you get in game so that is an incentive to put real money to get them.

[2023-01-09 13:55:15] <numinuminumnumnum> @Skyle4f Not just that, but it's almost all Outfits, not individual gear, there's a lot that is left wanting for separate pieces
[2023-01-09 13:55:17] <daze413> @ishreku1v1m8 yes true. i was only talking about getting better gear for gold- which doesnt exist in this game in particular
[2023-01-09 13:55:17] <+plummleys1> good ones come from acheivements too

[2023-01-09 13:55:38] <Skyle4f> @numinuminumnumnum I agree
[2023-01-09 13:55:38] <+DropZeBait> I have more time in WvW than any normal person should have in this game period, and you physically can't show yourself there w/o looking supreme

[2023-01-09 13:55:47] <+Rymm_> there is certainly a tradeoff for the game being one time purchase, but I can tell you that in 11 years of this game not once have I felt like I'm pushed to spend money, I sort of passively obtained everything I wanted in a reasonable timeframe

[2023-01-09 14:00:47] <Vestina> yeah anet went crazy with currencies
[2023-01-09 14:00:49] <allfightstar> salvage PepeLaugh
[2023-01-09 14:00:51] <%0rektquiem> ngl the currencies are a bit overwhelming for a new player lmao
[2023-01-09 14:00:52] <%Vinestra28> a lot of.. living story zones have their own curriencies
[2023-01-09 14:00:52] <Official_Casual> @Preachlfw save the gems in order to buy the season 1-6 story content
[2023-01-09 14:00:54] <+aereton> SALVAGE ahhhh
[2023-01-09 14:00:56] <+DropZeBait> Worsee
[2023-01-09 14:00:58] <ishreku1v1m8> @silimaur brother of course they'd be the same skill level but having ascended vs exotic objectively makes them stronger and of course youd out dps a new player lol
[2023-01-09 14:01:00] <DoctorPall> Clear your bags, might not have place for loot
[2023-01-09 14:01:03] <Goraka91> It's not as bad at it looks, each new map has it's own currency but they're functionally the same thing gotten the same way
[2023-01-09 14:01:04] <%+TottWriter> material storage is a separate part of the bank
[2023-01-09 14:01:04] <hal2210> some must fight so all can be free Sadge
[2023-01-09 14:01:06] <bias22> use salvage kits to convert old gear into mats
[2023-01-09 14:01:10] <+Zilwer11> Bank is perfectly structured :)
[2023-01-09 14:01:11] <+NekoNura> Probably still empty, Material storage is seperate
[2023-01-09 14:01:11] <Wildonfire> just salvage the gear you can not use
[2023-01-09 14:01:12] <+kalamari__> watch the sky
[2023-01-09 14:01:12] <+derpz> Full of mats probably
[2023-01-09 14:01:14] <Exfr> The material bank sel-organises
[2023-01-09 14:01:15] <Tovya> the reagent bank is good you should check it later.

[2023-01-09 14:01:36] <%DeadlyDarro> First time doing this one. Done a bunch of others in lower level areas.
[2023-01-09 14:01:36] <%+silimaur> @ishreku1v1m8 but that is kinda the point, the gold is not the issue. People buying it becuase they think they need ascended or think that having 10% more stats will make them better is a mistake

[2023-01-09 14:02:07] <+OracleCura> The one thing I do kinda hate about this game is the way the game treats loot. Inventory just always becomes so cluttered without a lot of effort to stop that. =/

[2023-01-09 14:02:22] <hal2210> copper fed NODDERS
[2023-01-09 14:02:24] <+Zilwer11> You have the blue salvage kit aswell

[2023-01-09 14:02:31] <Wildonfire> There is an npc next to you that you can sell to
[2023-01-09 14:02:31] <Elaanayo> coppper fed EZ
[2023-01-09 14:02:32] <+TrayvonKing> @OracleCura its to make you buy more inventory space
[2023-01-09 14:02:33] <Clinona> But also copper fed is BIS
[2023-01-09 14:02:33] <waggamsn> Savior of Savage
[2023-01-09 14:02:34] <+DropZeBait> Stop being such a boomer Mike, you have a full stack of salvage kits still LUL
[2023-01-09 14:02:34] <+JozzeTv> all these currencies work the same and can be gotten the same way, just on different maps. it helps with players returning to older zones not only for grinding gold, but also for getting the currency they need
[2023-01-09 14:02:36] <+Jamemoff> how are you finding GW2 mike?
[2023-01-09 14:02:36] <twobladepete> love the copper fed

[2023-01-09 14:02:37] <+StoicPJ> Copper Fed is life

[2023-01-09 14:02:39] <+DropZeBait> I love you really <3
[2023-01-09 14:02:39] <Exfr> Pre almost done
[2023-01-09 14:02:40] <Siggi_EMP> that sounds like a poor problem KEKL
[2023-01-09 14:02:40] <frankthedsigner> Definitely copper fed
[2023-01-09 14:02:42] <numinuminumnumnum> @MortyQ Yes, only must have thing in this game from the store KEKW
[2023-01-09 14:02:42] <ishreku1v1m8> @silimaur there is no game where a currency magically increases your skill obviously but saying gold doesnt matter is not very true
[2023-01-09 14:02:43] <%+silimaur> @0rektquiem I think it’s a noob trap to fall into though personally
[2023-01-09 14:02:45] <%0rektquiem> Copper-fed BEST INVESTMENT
[2023-01-09 14:02:53] <shytam> you  might say you salvaged the situation
[2023-01-09 14:02:56] <Vestina> Need that Copper Fed goodness, actually the best item
[2023-01-09 14:03:00] <LandeFTW> buy one of each rarity of salvage kit and throw them into the mystic forge ..... that makes you a good salvage kit
[2023-01-09 14:03:01] <hal2210> it does
[2023-01-09 14:03:02] <Tovya> I love the GW2 music. So good.

[2023-01-09 14:04:57] <+Pazy160> Inventory is one of the few things I dont like about GW2. Loots bags inside loot bags, items with a single use I carry for months while earning the corresponding items. Ive taken to just throwing most things away and focusing on the gameplay.

[2023-01-09 14:06:27] <ishreku1v1m8> @silimaur you dont need to buy gold definitely and if you do its better spent with gems but theyre kind of in the same boat though i dont think a new player would regret it if they spent extra money on gems

[2023-01-09 15:06:39] <%Shelana95> It is a buton next to the minimap
[2023-01-09 15:06:39] <%yashiru_> top right i think

[2023-01-09 15:06:42] <shytam> well the compass gives you a direciton
[2023-01-09 15:06:43] <TheresADesign> hover on minimap
[2023-01-09 15:06:43] <shearqan> just press m
[2023-01-09 15:06:44] <xLeopanther> nah, just open map and zoom out
[2023-01-09 15:06:50] <klaxyd> there is a icon in lion's arch
[2023-01-09 15:06:50] <tobbelitoinfinito> No
[2023-01-09 15:06:52] <%Shelana95> Thats it
[2023-01-09 15:06:53] <Hjolt> well thats not exactly it guys
[2023-01-09 15:06:53] <solaze_> ye
[2023-01-09 15:06:56] <waggamsn> I think no zoom, have to find it yourself
[2023-01-09 15:07:07] <mett7> yes its a navigation
[2023-01-09 15:07:07] <%+TottWriter> that's as much as you get, mostly people zoom out on world map
[2023-01-09 15:07:12] <aldevar> yeah, not really, you have to find it
[2023-01-09 15:07:14] <xLeopanther> map navigation is part of the adventure!
[2023-01-09 15:07:28] <Hjolt> atleast it's not like Morrowind Kappa
[2023-01-09 15:07:29] <aldevar> It does lead you through the portals, towards your location, if you're far enough
[2023-01-09 15:07:35] <Hjolt> "go to the south of the big stone in the north"
[2023-01-09 15:07:39] <%voltagg3> not much
[2023-01-09 15:07:40] <+Mustache_Mat> sometime quests will send you a letter that will auto show you an area you need to go its a button "Show on Map" or somthing like that
[2023-01-09 15:07:50] <solaze_> Your mount dye is hideous
[2023-01-09 15:08:00] <xLeopanther> no u
[2023-01-09 15:08:06] <%+TottWriter> There's a bug with core story. When the instance is in another map it just puts the icon in the centre
[2023-01-09 15:08:07] <aldevar> Also what Mustache said, it's just core storyline is a bit tedious in that sense

[2023-01-09 15:21:26] <frankthedsigner> It's usually utility skills
[2023-01-09 15:21:27] <+evilmerc> hammer has fields
[2023-01-09 15:21:29] <MarrtuEZ> you only have combo field in dwarf stance in your current setup
[2023-01-09 15:21:33] <%Zabraxa> @captainuselessv2 probably more casual than FF
[2023-01-09 15:21:33] <%+stormingg> main hand mace has combos
[2023-01-09 15:21:33] <noriatak> @Preachlfw mace skill 2 is a field skill, it's fire field, your current weapons have finishers, not combo fields.
[2023-01-09 15:21:35] <%0rektquiem> @captainuselessv2 very. you can play it casual and you can play it 'hardcore'
[2023-01-09 15:21:40] <solaze_> @secretskritt order of whispers is garbage, should be Order of Tybalt
[2023-01-09 15:21:42] <Samibacsi> @captainuselessv2 No subscritpion so you can just do nothing forever

[2023-01-09 15:21:52] <Cloudladder> chat is End of Dragons good? havent played for eons
[2023-01-09 15:22:03] <goatman92> do mace skill 2 to get the fire field then do mace skill 3. It becomes explody
[2023-01-09 15:22:03] <frume13> dwarf stability-road is a field-skill
[2023-01-09 15:22:05] <Darkbeaster> You are saying some funny words

[2023-01-09 15:22:10] <Mydw1nter> @Cloudladder End of Dragons has the best GW2 story by miles IMO.
[2023-01-09 15:22:12] <+StoicPJ> Mace/axe are condi weapons. Sword is a power weapon
[2023-01-09 15:22:13] <%Vinestra28> Isnt the basic gyst of the fields/combos is someone eg: Tosses oil on the ground /slows foes with it and someone ignites i with ifre?

[2023-01-09 15:22:33] <hyphenp> that loading screen has been my wallpaper for 10 years now lol
[2023-01-09 15:22:34] <%+TottWriter> @Cloudladder I enjoyed it. There are moments you feel the timecruch the devs had, but it's got some top tier moments
[2023-01-09 15:22:35] <SoFisht> @Vinestra28 the best example to think about is a fire field lighting projectiles on fire.
[2023-01-09 15:22:40] <%0rektquiem> the combat has some depth tbh
[2023-01-09 15:22:41] <sharladan> i came for the biches
[2023-01-09 15:22:43] <mez_taz> @Preachlfw a little tip when you swtich stances you go back to 50 energy
[2023-01-09 15:22:45] <+Brandonhipster> The pvp area with dummy target and everything unlock is a good place to learn combat

[2023-01-09 15:23:12] <+Cycanee> ye
[2023-01-09 15:23:12] <Multiblade_Twitch> brutal bolts was the combo you did
[2023-01-09 15:23:13] <LewdAvocado> Burtal Bolts was the combo
[2023-01-09 15:23:16] <mez_taz> yep
[2023-01-09 15:23:17] <+Cycanee> "brutal bolts"
[2023-01-09 15:23:18] <Skyle4f> the bolts
[2023-01-09 15:23:18] <Taufanxz> the brutal bolt pop out
[2023-01-09 15:23:18] <xLeopanther> the 'brutal bolts' that showed up was the combo
[2023-01-09 15:23:19] <Exfr> The Brutal Bolts popup NODDERS
[2023-01-09 15:23:19] <Onox> the brutal bolts. yes
[2023-01-09 15:23:19] <frume13> lightning + whirl is vulnerability
[2023-01-09 15:23:20] <+evilmerc> brutal bolts
[2023-01-09 15:23:20] <%+TottWriter> The "Brutal Bolts" was it, yeah
[2023-01-09 15:23:21] <%+Bashiel> brutal bolts yeah
[2023-01-09 15:23:23] <The_Grimoire> @val89 what D: there are boats/skiffs
[2023-01-09 15:23:24] <frankthedsigner> Yes
[2023-01-09 15:23:28] <+Razzin_> any player who shoots through it will get lightning proc
[2023-01-09 15:23:28] <musaharik> bolts yes
[2023-01-09 15:23:28] <%+TottWriter> But it's an AoE thing
[2023-01-09 15:23:28] <%+Geri_0123> applied vuln
[2023-01-09 15:23:30] <+aereton> @Cloudladder I liked HoT more for its meta events (tho Dragons End is fantastic) and PoF more for its metroidvania but it's absolutely worth it, story is 10/10, pacing is mostly good and there is a lot to explore/achieve, plus fishing is a goldmaking machine
[2023-01-09 15:23:32] <%+lalandir> Try hammer blast finisher through it PauseChamp
[2023-01-09 15:23:32] <frankthedsigner> And you can combo with other players
[2023-01-09 15:23:32] <mett7> bolts coz it was whirl
[2023-01-09 15:23:33] <MarrtuEZ> most finishers are just adding condis to the skill/giving you boons
[2023-01-09 15:23:35] <+FreeKatze> road skill + staff 4 combo give you speed buff
[2023-01-09 15:23:39] <mez_taz> also when you switch stances you always go back to 50 energy
[2023-01-09 15:23:40] <+Cycanee> they are
[2023-01-09 15:23:40] <SoFisht> they are very good
[2023-01-09 15:23:43] <TheresADesign> now find skills with finishers
[2023-01-09 15:23:43] <%+TottWriter> they are more powerdul in group combat
[2023-01-09 15:23:45] <%NomadHook> Switching legends will reset your energy in combat back to 50%, making it a nice flow to swap legends frequently
[2023-01-09 15:23:45] <MarrtuEZ> it's way less impactful than it is made out to be
[2023-01-09 15:23:46] <Goraka91> OSFrog
[2023-01-09 15:23:47] <+Rymm_> Some combos are more powerful. some less
[2023-01-09 15:23:55] <noriatak> You create brutal bolts, they generate vulnerability on the enemies when using a whirl finished @Preachlfw
[2023-01-09 15:23:55] <%+val89> @The_Grimoire I know they exist, it's a shame this pgePoorT  doesn't have one, is all
[2023-01-09 15:23:56] <mett7> blast is best finisher

[2023-01-09 15:24:13] <maosama11> this music KEKWQ
[2023-01-09 15:24:13] <+aereton> water blast anything else can be ignored
[2023-01-09 15:24:16] <klaxyd> sword axe and staff will carry you to end game
[2023-01-09 15:24:17] <+Rymm_> Combos tend to be more important in PvP nowadays
[2023-01-09 15:24:18] <xLeopanther> most used is blast + fire field for aoe might to allies. or blast + water field for aoe healing
[2023-01-09 15:24:19] <marpond_> @Preachlfw Combo fields and finishers are often neglected because there can be a lot of variations and they don't play a huge role in the rotation of a class. But they are very useful late in the game as they can give you extra damage, crowd control, healing etc
[2023-01-09 15:24:19] <%+Geri_0123> what is that
[2023-01-09 15:24:22] <+aereton> maybe light blast for condi removal

[2023-01-09 15:31:29] <%Nanonaps> rather want to be with the nerds or the trumped up militia? Whispers all the way
[2023-01-09 15:31:37] <+Trigarta> The oother order questlines are pretty boring. Whispers has character.
[2023-01-09 15:31:38] <%+Geri_0123> they apply vuln

[2023-01-09 15:40:38] <%+SHENVAI> @Kelwinnx there is no rush, you can play through it from scratch no problem
[2023-01-09 15:40:38] <%+Awerlu> @Glamrock_Bun I cant forgive Charr for GW1
[2023-01-09 15:40:40] <The_Grimoire> @Kelwinnx why, though? everything is available and you can do things at your own pace. there is no rush at all
[2023-01-09 15:40:40] <Shiva24> mounting in those early zones feels wrong :/
[2023-01-09 15:40:41] <+SeriousBear> @Glamrock_Bun Because Mike isn't a furry
[2023-01-09 15:40:47] <SeisTV> so how's the GW2 gameplay?
[2023-01-09 15:40:48] <%+Telcontar1337> @Kelwinnx you missed nothing, you can just start and experience the world
[2023-01-09 15:40:50] <PaeToWin> @Kelwinnx as in a fresh server? there's no point to it, you can do all content right now
[2023-01-09 15:40:50] <%Vinestra28> NOPERS
[2023-01-09 15:40:51] <Krystalchan> @Kelwinnx to be fair none of the old content gets phased out like in other MMOs
[2023-01-09 15:40:53] <%NomadHook> @Kelwinnx Because of the Vertical nature of the game (they have never raised the level or gear cap). You really don't have to worry about starting now
[2023-01-09 15:40:55] <noriatak> Because they ruined pre searing ascalon Sadge
[2023-01-09 15:40:55] <%yashiru_> there is another world boss under this dung

[2023-01-09 15:41:00] <Trafikk_> the Dungeon is VERY related to this area :p
[2023-01-09 15:41:02] <Glamrock_Bun> Humans ar so Generic in Games

[2023-01-09 15:41:09] <mez_taz> all the dungeons are side stories
[2023-01-09 15:41:12] <tobbelitoinfinito> It’s parallel story
[2023-01-09 15:41:13] <trixo_zawun> it's never too late to play gw2, it has horizontal progression
[2023-01-09 15:41:15] <%NomadHook> @Kelwinnx Horizontal not vertical. I am tired

[2023-01-09 15:43:03] <yuiona> scaling isnt perfect
[2023-01-09 15:43:03] <%+Geri_0123> you can, traits and correct gears matter a lot

[2023-01-09 15:43:04] <ixoAnaMaria> seeing 3k+ streamer on GW2 :D awesome!
[2023-01-09 15:43:05] <MortyQ> in story scaling doesn't work that well
[2023-01-09 15:43:06] <+kalamari__> you can
[2023-01-09 15:43:06] <%sooziecuzie> You can be carried by knowledge, though.
[2023-01-09 15:43:08] <%Neroniss_> about that...

[2023-01-09 15:43:12] <mattakola> the scaling is not that powerful
[2023-01-09 15:43:13] <ItsMeSaaj> they can carry with gear though
[2023-01-09 15:43:16] <%+silimaur> Scaling only works to a poiny

[2023-01-09 15:43:24] <noriatak> Holo is pretty much 2nd best dps easily
[2023-01-09 15:43:25] <%0rektquiem> @Krystalchan skills/mastery/knowledge of the dungeon does though
[2023-01-09 15:43:27] <ItsMeSaaj> your level goes down, but you still get bonus from the higher level gear
[2023-01-09 15:43:28] <+DDgravy> Did you know the majority of players in gw2 that play solo are sylvari? they always seem to 'branch' off on their own..
[2023-01-09 15:43:37] <+aereton> "no one uses LFG in GW2"
[2023-01-09 15:43:41] <ixoAnaMaria> he is new to GW2:o
[2023-01-09 15:43:41] <Radium_Lavans> They got all the skills and way better gear so they will carrying you
[2023-01-09 15:43:41] <The_Grimoire> @DDgravy get out
[2023-01-09 15:43:43] <+Mustache_Mat> story can be done solo its just about killing everything while in a cutscene lol

[2023-01-09 15:43:53] <ixoAnaMaria> @aereton everyone use it!!
[2023-01-09 15:43:55] <simplySouron> damage etc is scaled, gear, specialisations etc is not
[2023-01-09 15:43:56] <Jack_Vikas> @Preachlfw You can rightclick the new boots and choose stats
[2023-01-09 15:44:01] <ixoAnaMaria> but not in dungeons
[2023-01-09 15:44:02] <revanton93> headgear?
[2023-01-09 15:44:03] <troubletooth> Mechanist is the most broken they have released in a while. can do msot dps with a basic rotation
[2023-01-09 15:44:06] <revanton93> that mask is bad?
[2023-01-09 15:44:09] <httppick> @SeisTV eu. server doesnt matter outside of wvw. there is a mega server system
[2023-01-09 15:44:11] <crystalxpaladin> exp is not at all a problem if u do the tequatl world boss event!!!
[2023-01-09 15:44:13] <numinuminumnumnum> @Glamrock_Bun Humans are defo the more interesting in GW2, they're actually closer to being elves if they lived longer and had pointy ears, they're an ancient race with actual gods, known for magical prowess and on the decline (or was), as opposed to Sylvari who are more young and naive
[2023-01-09 15:44:16] <noriatak> @Preachlfw the non stat boots have selectable stats
[2023-01-09 15:44:16] <ixoAnaMaria> usually people don't do dungeons in GW2
[2023-01-09 15:44:23] <%NomadHook> @aereton LFG is really active, but people are often scared to start their own groups, so it can look empty (even if parties fill quickly)
[2023-01-09 15:44:27] <SoFisht> thos are the old ones
[2023-01-09 15:44:27] <MortyQ> the ones in your bag he meant
[2023-01-09 15:44:30] <+Noxxi_Greenrose> It's the stats that get scaled, higher level and better gear still gives a tiny bit more stats when downscaled in level
[2023-01-09 15:44:31] <Jack_Vikas> @Preachlfw The ones in your bag, nt equipped
[2023-01-09 15:44:31] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> those boots stats are already set
[2023-01-09 15:44:36] [Notification] Paranoidezz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! [Can't believe we're going strong for 3 years already! Hope you have a lovely 2023!]
[2023-01-09 15:44:37] <noriatak> @Preachlfw the new boots you got, the one in your bag that dont have stats on them.
[2023-01-09 15:44:37] <Kirzan> Gear that's without stats.
[2023-01-09 15:44:43] <+Squats3> the gearing system in GW2 is simple yet confusing as hell.

[2023-01-09 15:45:20] <+aereton> @NomadHook yeah I know, I never once had to wait longer than a few minutes even for the most obscure lfg I posted
[2023-01-09 15:45:21] <numinuminumnumnum> @aereton Yeah, the LFG groups get filled very quickly so it appears empty but you just get groups filled instantly, ofc there's parts of the LFG tool that are more barren and redundant, but not dungeons

[2023-01-09 16:01:48] <Goraka91> NOPERS No elp
[2023-01-09 16:01:51] <%+TottWriter> @AeilAwadar Now, yes. but the game is 10 years old
[2023-01-09 16:01:56] <numinuminumnumnum> @Shiva24 And that someone is the person revenants can summon as a legend, Venthir!
[2023-01-09 16:02:07] <%0rektquiem> @frume13 not to mention they stopped working on it a long time ago and moved on to other instanced content
[2023-01-09 16:02:07] <+tyrew0rm> May the Pale Tree Bless you all
[2023-01-09 16:02:16] <MolotovN> why is there no spiderJam? monkaHmm
[2023-01-09 16:02:16] <%+TottWriter> @numinuminumnumnum not quite. It was the human Ronan who planted it
[2023-01-09 16:02:23] <nohomu67> That's basically how it goes with her, yeah
[2023-01-09 16:02:26] <sat_0shi> its you factor in the developement time, its alot older then 10 years
[2023-01-09 16:02:30] <Shiva24> @numinuminumnumnum didnt wanna name it for people that didnt see GW 1 ending :)
[2023-01-09 16:02:37] <emerald_kiki> nope
[2023-01-09 16:02:38] <+Rymm_> not really
[2023-01-09 16:02:39] <DevianCroft> @frume13 Thank God Arena dropped dungeons after this. Yay Kappa (Hell no)
[2023-01-09 16:02:40] <%+Geri_0123> nah
[2023-01-09 16:02:43] <kalameesjr> they actually dont get too extreme
[2023-01-09 16:02:45] <+Infyra> 50k+ is a high hit
[2023-01-09 16:02:45] <Escamimi> 40k dps top game
[2023-01-09 16:02:45] <amindrex> Pale Tree is looking kinda...pale
[2023-01-09 16:02:49] <%+Geri_0123> endgame builds do around 38-40k dps
[2023-01-09 16:02:50] <+Raif89> not really no
[2023-01-09 16:02:51] <%Shelana95> not at all
[2023-01-09 16:02:52] <+Cycanee> around 5 digits
[2023-01-09 16:02:53] <numinuminumnumnum> @TottWriter Oh yeah, I mixed up, he planted and Venthir is the one who nurtured it
[2023-01-09 16:02:55] <+StoicPJ> It normalizes. Top dps is like 40k
[2023-01-09 16:02:55] <%+TottWriter> Ronan planted the tree on the graves of his family, but centaurs live longer so ventari became caretaker of the tree
[2023-01-09 16:02:56] <crystalxpaladin> offhand sword gives even more dps numbers
[2023-01-09 16:02:56] <einfachnorb> chat what was your biggest hit?
[2023-01-09 16:02:56] <noriatak> nah, the stupid huge numbers are really really really late into the game and are super rare
[2023-01-09 16:03:00] <%asukarae12> guessing he doesnt know about the gear plateu
[2023-01-09 16:03:02] <Slamdzr> number's are pretty tame in gw2
[2023-01-09 16:03:02] <%Neroniss_> I'm seeing 30-50k usually
[2023-01-09 16:03:03] VIEWERS: 3 389
[2023-01-09 16:03:03] <Siggi_EMP> you can see 6 figures on bosses if you play bladesworn
[2023-01-09 16:03:08] <%spejspag> 6 digits tops
[2023-01-09 16:03:08] <marpond_> Balance wise the game is at it's best so far
[2023-01-09 16:03:09] <trixo_zawun> only if you know how to play and do speedruns with very specific settings
[2023-01-09 16:03:11] <%+nvwls> highest dps on patchwerk is like 40k in this game
[2023-01-09 16:03:12] <+Rymm_> 4Head
[2023-01-09 16:03:13] <secretskritt> 15k dps all you need
[2023-01-09 16:03:15] <nabfel> EZ
[2023-01-09 16:03:16] <%Vinestra28> @TottWriter its the centaurs teachings though iirc
[2023-01-09 16:03:17] <SoFisht> @einfachnorb bladesworn blasting CoolCat
[2023-01-09 16:03:18] <+Leafskin> Bladesworn can go over 100k a hit
[2023-01-09 16:03:20] <noriatak> bladesworn is the only that can deal 6 digits but it's super SUPER situational
[2023-01-09 16:03:22] <%Shelana95> if you do 40, you are in Echo
[2023-01-09 16:03:23] <Exfr> @einfachnorb I assassinated a mosquito for 1.5M once
[2023-01-09 16:03:25] <%dragothicx> it wont creep up to diablo numbers because the numbers dont creep up on gear/levels
[2023-01-09 16:03:27] <%0rektquiem> yeah the balance right now is in the right place
[2023-01-09 16:03:29] <+Infyra> 40k dps is REALLY high
[2023-01-09 16:03:29] <+NekoNura> Because there is no gear treadmil you plateu at 80
[2023-01-09 16:03:39] <+Rymm_> elaDespair
[2023-01-09 16:03:44] <+danytt> highest possible number from 1 skill is around 100-300k and just from 1 build
[2023-01-09 16:03:44] <+aereton> just play mech, 30k dps with auto attack LUL

[2023-01-09 16:03:45] <numinuminumnumnum> @Shiva24 That's fair, though by now it's very open lore knowledge for GW2
[2023-01-09 16:03:47] <einfachnorb> @einfachnorb holy shit LUL
[2023-01-09 16:03:51] <%+Geri_0123> 45k is the max benchmark, but it's m7 deadeye memes so not realistic
[2023-01-09 16:03:53] <%Shelana95> 40k is deffo Echo numbers.. that is not normal
[2023-01-09 16:03:55] <sat_0shi> those arent super high numbers, wow literally had to make an expansion to squish calculation on numbesr because it was literally costing them money in cooling cpu usage on servers, thast how bad they got in dmg numbers

[2023-01-09 16:04:42] <%Neroniss_> @Geri_0123 hey, I play that
[2023-01-09 16:04:44] <Shiva24> @numinuminumnumnum havent really played GW 2 after Living world began ^^
[2023-01-09 16:04:44] <%+TottWriter> I mean even if she didn't, i don't see her playing mmos
[2023-01-09 16:04:46] <%Vinestra28> @Vinestra28 when did fantastical beasts come out?
[2023-01-09 16:04:51] <tf_reeee> in 10 years the game has only been power crept by about 20k dps, across three expansions and 27 elite specs

[2023-01-09 16:05:28] <+BWORKS> @whiskeyjack03 Yes, this is 2012 content

[2023-01-09 16:05:48] <%MA_Scynths> @raamonez the question should me if Ele is viable period Sadge
[2023-01-09 16:05:49] <Hjolt> well

[2023-01-09 16:05:52] <Hahkil> u mean when it was actually about fantastic beasts
[2023-01-09 16:05:54] <+kalamari__> first good, second meh, third awful
[2023-01-09 16:05:56] <%+awkswow> All three specs have dps specs that are good, tempest can also play healer.
[2023-01-09 16:05:56] <Radium_Lavans> First one was nice movie
[2023-01-09 16:06:00] <+Noraleen_> wait who are you talking about?
[2023-01-09 16:06:03] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> the first one was good, 2nd and 3rd no
[2023-01-09 16:06:03] <goatman92> All ELE is good but Weaver is best if you can figure out the best rotation
[2023-01-09 16:06:04] <whiskeyjack03> honestly, not bad for 2012 content, even if the "acting" is questionable at times NODDERS
[2023-01-09 16:06:09] <Shoemakerrr> How are you enjoying GW2? Getting a little bored of DF and thinking of trying it out
[2023-01-09 16:06:09] <The_Grimoire> @MA_Scynths viable, yes. are there better options with less effort? also, yes
[2023-01-09 16:06:12] <+Sol_Kari> first one was a decent movie then it went downhill

[2023-01-09 16:09:39] <%+Geri_0123> @Shoemakerrr much mor simplistic than wow/ff boss design
[2023-01-09 16:09:42] <The_Grimoire> @Shoemakerrr there are 2 versions for boss fights, normal and challenge mode, the latest, harvest temple CM/challenge mode, is the hardest and very few groups have defeated it so far
[2023-01-09 16:09:48] <+Morvidus> @Shoemakerrr boss are unusual. its almost all personal responsibility since there's so few that are actually "tanked"
[2023-01-09 16:09:50] <%ilandra> @SoFisht i think it's the shade/illusion effect
[2023-01-09 16:09:53] <+Squats3> @Shoemakerrr you dont play GW2 to raid. the game is all about its story
[2023-01-09 16:09:57] <The_Grimoire> @Shoemakerrr that applies to the latest boss fights, though, about 5 or so
[2023-01-09 16:09:59] <+Noraleen_> sohotin looks wild in this ghost form
[2023-01-09 16:10:04] <+Infyra> you must have the highest thoughness in the party, that makes you their target

[2023-01-09 16:10:20] <aganod44> for me it's exactly the opposite @Squats3
[2023-01-09 16:10:22] <+aereton> @Shoemakerrr boss design from OG content is a bit lackluster, as you can see here (tho there are a few golden nuggets) but expac boss content is top notch
[2023-01-09 16:10:23] <SoFisht> GW2's PvE is still fun cause the combat is fun. Plenty of people dont play ofr story

[2023-01-09 16:12:00] <orophia> @Squats3 have you done raids in gw2 before?
[2023-01-09 16:12:00] <+squizm> this game gives so much loot in general
[2023-01-09 16:12:00] <aganod44> you just have a small inventory :)

[2023-01-09 16:12:05] <thomas21400> you need to try the raids
[2023-01-09 16:12:06] <sleepy_fork> does he know that wow m+ was inspired by gw2 fractals?
[2023-01-09 16:12:06] <%Venkix> and gold
[2023-01-09 16:12:07] <j0shst3r> @SoFisht GW2 PvE is fun but the raids suck and they've triple downed on developing that content instead of WvW (which is why i quit)
[2023-01-09 16:12:07] <+kahlakah> Waaaait
[2023-01-09 16:12:07] <%+Geri_0123> seeeing arcdps for the first time is eye opening in the game.  (but no point until 80)
[2023-01-09 16:12:08] <+Infyra> did he do the explorable paths for the first 2 dungeons?
[2023-01-09 16:12:09] <Shaklug> I would love to see how they develop the group PepeLaugh

[2023-01-09 16:13:05] <%+silimaur> @sofisht don’t listen to others on raids imo. I’d give them a try yourself as there are a lot of people down on them without having much experience

[2023-01-09 16:15:33] <numinuminumnumnum> @orophia The GW2 raids are quite hard and remains hard even as the game progresses, it's like always going in synced, and the bosses are fairly well designed
