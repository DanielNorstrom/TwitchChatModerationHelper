[2023-01-01 02:42:03] <!%gunblade00> Just before midnight on New Year's Eve, people hold hands and sing a traditional song called "Auld Lang Syne". They count the seconds down to the new year and when the clock strikes midnight, they hug and kiss and wish each other a Happy New Year! Sometimes people set off fireworks as the new year begins.

[2023-01-01 09:24:07] <Allgrim1> Same with the horse. Probably singleplayer escapes
[2023-01-01 09:24:58] <!%gunblade00> -The third escape, Do The Locomotive is probably the hardest escape possible. You have to obtain weapons from anywhere in the train, make your way all the way to the front, and take out all 3 guards present in the front. It is very straightforward however it can be challenging taking out all 3 guards as they all have good weapons. This escape can only be done in multiplayer.
