[2022-12-26 20:20:52] <%Suiciderke> Hyuk  A term coined by the Starcraft commentator Cholera, named after the Korean pro Starcraft player Hyuk, used to describe the act of losing after having a seemingly insurmountable lead. It came about due to Hyuk's repeated failures even with all the odds in his favour in several pro-league matches. Well he seems to have the game in the bag, but give him time, he could still hyuk it up.
