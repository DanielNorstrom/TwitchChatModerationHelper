[2023-01-07 00:09:57] <JonyVole> @Eien_no_Hikari well yes, but the gun has its limits, a good turn and your shot will miss, what I mean is an AA like the FlaRakRad, ADATS, or any other long-range high-performance missiles

[2023-01-07 00:42:59] <!%TheSwatKnight> yeah one of the reasons her model is actually shorter than she is
[2023-01-07 00:42:59] <freeeezmanz> I think guys average is 5'9" and women's average is 5'4"
[2023-01-07 00:43:11] <HaitianSensation> For me, I typically assume most girls are shorter than me since most are
[2023-01-07 00:43:11] <!%TheSwatKnight> and she's more like 6'1
[2023-01-07 00:43:15] <@%Wloos> Tall queens get it rough with ppl being mean over being tall

[2023-01-07 00:43:38] <Gamer17138> im 5.9  and belong to the slightly below average

[2023-01-07 00:43:42] <@%Aamanes> must be living a really sad life
[2023-01-07 00:43:53] <JonyVole> average in Czechia is 5'10 for guys, which makes sense considering i tower over most ppl
[2023-01-07 00:43:54] <Madishgod> Ari do you prefer having long hair or short?
[2023-01-07 00:44:00] <SuTTi26> @Wloos well germany so 5'11 is kind of average you know
[2023-01-07 00:44:02] <!%TheSwatKnight> 173cm apparently for women in Germany

[2023-01-07 00:58:21] <%GerardDG> Optimal height is clearly 193cm, coincidentally, I am 193cm

[2023-01-07 19:19:25] <SuTTi26> @TheSwatKnight what material is the floor ?
[2023-01-07 19:19:51] <%sheephead__> 7cm is quite a lot, that's plenty for most people right. The first couple cms are the most important anyway, I don't see why you'd ever need more than 7cm, that should be big enough for most
[2023-01-07 19:20:17] <!%TheSwatKnight> @sheephead__ thought about 6 or 7cm however the isolation was important

[2023-01-07 22:10:35] <%noremann> you can still do non-dual wield magnum for sharpshooter
