[2022-12-23 00:30:45] <wkingofangmar> Your description says "If you enjoy talking about weird stuff, ASMR etc." soo may I ask a kinda strange thing here? Why do ppl like ASMR? How does someone find it comforting rather than for the lack of better word 'annoying' (dont mean to be rude).

[2022-12-23 00:40:09] <%the_cheesegod420> some people will run away from the healer and then complain for not healing them
[2022-12-23 00:40:15] <%AslanGrants> Support is more important than DPS
[2022-12-23 00:40:26] <%AslanGrants> Any DPS is effective if support is playing well
[2022-12-23 00:40:34] <%AslanGrants> But DPS can't perform if Support isn't

[2022-12-23 19:53:27] <Tyrie2001> Thr thought of -45C takes me back to the days when work had the walk-in freezers set to -35C, with the fans running while you were inside dropping it down to -45C with the wind chill.
