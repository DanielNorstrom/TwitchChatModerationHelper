Why doesn't james make hilis a mod, because she's always here and despite trolling a lot, hilis is pretty trustworthy. sometimes chat goes without mod because JD is on the other side of the earth, Cap is playing, and beth needs a well deserved break from modding. so why can't we give them some assistance? i'm being serious, no joking here
