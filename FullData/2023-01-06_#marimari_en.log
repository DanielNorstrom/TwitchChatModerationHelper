[2023-01-06 11:52:27] <MooseLounge> 3 houses felt mediocre because they spent more resources making 3 stories rather than 1 decent story.

[2023-01-06 11:52:40] <%+jdlc57> fire emblem awakening is better since it has more in one package

Then she says "Don't worry, I brought protection for you" and she pulls a chain of 100 condoms from out of her empty palm. Finally, when she's going to put the condom on with her mouth instead she quickly blows the condom up into a balloon dog.
