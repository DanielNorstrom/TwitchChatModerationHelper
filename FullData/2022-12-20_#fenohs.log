[2022-12-20 16:29:42] <!%J_Alexander_HS> Oh come on. People can’t really be telling others the ten extra cards are good can they?
[2022-12-20 16:29:43] <+luciogabrielx> @J_Alexander_HS Seems to be the best until now, Jesse, do you agree?
[2022-12-20 16:29:49] <!%J_Alexander_HS> Surely they can’t be saying that
[2022-12-20 16:29:55] <HarryLivermore> Quest DH still the best deck btw

[2022-12-20 16:30:12] <Panacea108> 10 extra cards can be good to have more total win cons and be better vs theo
[2022-12-20 16:30:27] <Vengeance_88> @J_Alexander_HS They just like bigger decks no matter the size

[2022-12-20 16:31:33] <%thebigsadone> fenoKing said it best, renethal was for the masses, people who like to have fun deck building.

[2022-12-20 16:31:43] <%tuviejita89> give me my 10 garbage cards Chatting
[2022-12-20 16:31:44] <%SikiHS> ten more cards are way worse, because you have less chance to draw specific cards
[2022-12-20 16:31:47] <SweepingTV> If only you could have 60 cards, you would never lose
[2022-12-20 16:31:50] <+Ma_Po_> Ten more cards are bad most of the time that's just it people are just coping
[2022-12-20 16:31:53] <Carruj> if there was a 20 card renathal then it would be broken
[2022-12-20 16:31:57] <!%J_Alexander_HS> I’ve said it before. Someone could get rank one jumping off a cliff and half the player base would call it high skill and jump too
[2022-12-20 16:31:57] <DysenteryGary7> druid is renathal though right?

[2022-12-20 16:32:18] <OneTrickRogue> renathal should make your deck unlimited size!
[2022-12-20 16:32:19] <xJERGEN08> 30 is buff for gnolls no? more chance for them early
[2022-12-20 16:32:19] <pykesensei> @sandwraith03 if u brann plus anub (11 mana), you can second astalor + 2 third astalor and thats 64 dmg
[2022-12-20 16:32:26] <%Emeraath> aint no way man
[2022-12-20 16:32:30] <%digglerr> I think triple blood goes renethal

[2022-12-20 16:33:25] <simr_hs> In a paper tcg I play there is no upper deck limit and almost everyone plays minimum size decks, or maybe slightly above it.  If it was same in HS, people would settle to minimum size decks quickly as well.

[2022-12-20 16:35:36] <DopeeUK> 2 mana kills it

[2022-12-20 16:35:48] <bisheyy> Completely irrelevant

[2022-12-20 17:40:07] <%LordVctor> it changes the battlecry text to 16 when manathirst so it should work sitll
[2022-12-20 17:40:07] <%liezito> now its more clear

[2022-12-20 17:40:11] <stanleeyhs> its 24

[2022-12-20 17:40:13] <0utcastt> now it should do 32 because instead means it replaces battlecry
[2022-12-20 17:40:14] <bitbangboom> @HyperionHS you are wrong
[2022-12-20 17:40:14] <%laloouc> its instead, not something else
[2022-12-20 17:40:15] <P1nkrabb1t> it deals 32 wigh brann
[2022-12-20 17:40:16] <rblhc> Brann Astalaor is broken
[2022-12-20 17:40:16] <Vengeance_88> They said it didnt change how it works
[2022-12-20 17:40:17] <+PowerKirby> BM Madge
[2022-12-20 17:40:19] <meteospasmyl> it means instead of 8 it is 16 that simple
[2022-12-20 17:40:22] <%Awitor> it's still battlecry, just changed wtf
[2022-12-20 17:40:26] <%thebigsadone> they said it didnt change the brann interaction but mad it more clear for chat but apparently not LUL
[2022-12-20 17:40:27] <%+elkeegan> before brann was doubling the manathirst which wasn't supposed to happen, but interaction was correct, so they changed wording to use "instead"
[2022-12-20 17:40:27] <IronfistHS> best player atm btw
[2022-12-20 17:40:32] <+Elderknightz> its 32
[2022-12-20 17:40:35] <Ypertatos> ο μπραν κάνει το μπατλκράι 2 φορές, το manathirst Κάνει το batllecry από 8 -> 16
[2022-12-20 17:40:35] <+Teroo> it's just wording change it didn't change functionality
[2022-12-20 17:40:35] <tvorog_2754> it is 16+8?
[2022-12-20 17:40:37] <%becomesockboy> doesn't instead imply that the battlecry changes? so it would be 32 right
[2022-12-20 17:40:38] <%liezito> it was not a nerf, just changed the text
[2022-12-20 17:40:39] <GengarSmiles> what is there to not understand lmao
[2022-12-20 17:40:45] <%+elkeegan> @becomesockboy yes
[2022-12-20 17:40:46] <+Elderknightz> 16x2 with brann
[2022-12-20 17:40:47] <r1pftw> you had 8 mana
[2022-12-20 17:40:49] <%laloouc> the 5 mana dood does something more, the 8 mana replaces the battlecry @FenoHS
[2022-12-20 17:40:50] <%AnacondaHL> no it didn't
[2022-12-20 17:40:52] <%liezito> now changes the bc
[2022-12-20 17:40:52] <GengarSmiles> this one changes the battlecry to 16
[2022-12-20 17:40:53] <meteospasmyl> when you reach 10 mana replace 8 in the text by 16
[2022-12-20 17:40:54] <r1pftw> so do 8 dmg
[2022-12-20 17:40:58] <+Butterkase> on 10mana it deals 32 and under 10mana its 16 with brann
[2022-12-20 17:40:58] <+PowerKirby> the thing I don't understand is why only the last one doubles with brann
[2022-12-20 17:40:58] <0Phantazy> "INSTEAD" :_)
[2022-12-20 17:40:58] <+treofspades> It didn’t though it’s the opposite
[2022-12-20 17:40:58] <r1pftw> not 16
[2022-12-20 17:40:59] <reformedanduin> bro it does the same
[2022-12-20 17:40:59] <%AnacondaHL> it explicitly DID NOT adjust the battlecry

[2022-12-20 17:42:41] <NovaBSL> Manathirst and Battlecry are two separate things. But the Manathirst changes the Battlecry into what it says so it makes more sense now

[2022-12-20 17:42:56] <bogmonster2> outcast dh KEKG
[2022-12-20 17:42:56] <0utcastt> manathirst is like combo - a separate effect that happens to occur same time as battlecry, but with a certain condition, not doubled by Brann. this is why 2 mana astalor doesn't double with Brann. BUT if it says instead, it does double

[2022-12-20 17:44:06] <%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> the first two effects are manathirst abilities so brann doesnt affect them. The last one changes the battlecry so that is why it gets the extra damage with brann

[2022-12-20 18:25:01] <+JINRIKII> they should nerf cards for every other player but keep mine at full power
[2022-12-20 18:25:05] <%NakazatoJL> I just would make so cards can't cost bellow 1, that is much needed for a long time now

[2022-12-20 22:22:17] <babyyshaark_> alot reps is good cardio
[2022-12-20 22:22:18] <+tk_p> 10 is big max

[2022-12-20 22:22:29] <+cicciopoldo00> while playing burgle rogue somehow i always end up with that shit totem thingy

[2022-12-20 22:22:35] <%meltingnt> jack me dood
[2022-12-20 22:22:43] <AotC_> @meltingnt  HUH
[2022-12-20 22:22:43] <RRamco> 5 reps is good for pure strength, 8-12 for hyperthrophy, 15 for cardio. cardio is never the play
[2022-12-20 22:22:52] <%laloouc> not until turn 6
[2022-12-20 22:22:55] <%+deezubernuts> wait each side???
[2022-12-20 22:22:57] <+tk_p> 6-10 for hypertrophy

[2022-12-20 22:23:24] <babyyshaark_> u should even do less weight and like 25 reps then
[2022-12-20 22:23:25] <dalitzking> no lifesteal LUL
[2022-12-20 22:23:28] <Kombiko_> 15 is endurance, not cardio
[2022-12-20 22:23:30] <%meltingnt> reroll?
[2022-12-20 22:23:31] <RRamco> hyperthropy (muscle gain) is long term also better for weight loss because of the passive calorie burning from muscle mass
[2022-12-20 22:23:34] <saa_soli> high reps are better for cardio. low rep is good for pushing your max
