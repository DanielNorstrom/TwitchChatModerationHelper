[2023-01-07 14:00:14] <Akaya56> kome is definitely one of the content creators of all time. His guides are one of the ones I've seen. These clips are the part of my year. Without his videos, my day feels like a day. He's the most person I've ever met. His artifacts are one of the character builds I've ever seen. Undoubtedly one of the streamers in 2022
