[2022-12-10 11:34:57] <!%moshcraft> omen is really good for milling into scraps
[2022-12-10 11:34:57] <@^StreamElements> I have a discord channel feel free to join and keep up to date with my streams and decks that I use. just follow this link to join https://discord.gg/cBdSBFN KomodoHype
[2022-12-10 11:35:16] <modsurg4y> hello chatters Chatting
[2022-12-10 11:35:57] <!%moshcraft> i have 10k+ mo games and i don't understand omen either
[2022-12-10 11:36:04] <!%moshcraft> i might play it at 9p
[2022-12-10 11:36:13] <!%moshcraft> or 8
[2022-12-10 11:36:37] <swords_on> 9p ye
[2022-12-10 11:36:41] <swords_on> and even at 9
[2022-12-10 11:36:52] <swords_on> you will probably play something else
[2022-12-10 11:36:56] <!%moshcraft> best combo is mamuna + mistress but any deck you make with it sucks since you wasted 12p
[2022-12-10 11:37:12] <!%moshcraft> like that 12p could've been a triss
[2022-12-10 11:37:15] <+RoaringHillock> yeah when one play spends 30 provs it's probably wrong
[2022-12-10 11:37:29] <lagina_vover> is there a link to this deck?
[2022-12-10 11:37:55] <%Lulucienne> omen isnt tutoring is it ? KEKWait
[2022-12-10 11:37:56] <!%moshcraft> yeah agreed
[2022-12-10 11:38:04] <testing_pred> Even then it‚Äôs mammuna + gerni for 25 provs
[2022-12-10 11:38:05] <%Lulucienne> I thought it was from grave KEKWait
[2022-12-10 11:38:07] <testing_pred> Not even worth KEKL
[2022-12-10 11:38:19] <meego96> If it was from grave it would be busted
[2022-12-10 11:38:23] <beefbufff> kikimore and koschey are the best targets IMO
[2022-12-10 11:38:26] <!%moshcraft> gabane said he likes it for brewess+another dw card in r1 for tempo
[2022-12-10 11:38:32] <swords_on> i think second SY gold is a way more interesting card. Crime support it seems
[2022-12-10 11:38:48] <!%moshcraft> not play, summon lol
[2022-12-10 11:39:01] <%+theus_crw> i mean, whispering hill is 8p and uses one deathwish card from deck
[2022-12-10 11:39:12] <%+theus_crw> omen is 12p for 2 with rupture
[2022-12-10 11:39:20] <!%moshcraft> and doom
[2022-12-10 11:39:25] <+RoaringHillock> well there are two types of tutor play two cards in one turn legendaries: there's the MO kind where it summons and then the cards die, and there's the SY card where it plays and has a body and enables combos
[2022-12-10 11:39:26] <%+theus_crw> and doom yes
[2022-12-10 11:39:27] <@^StreamElements> If you are enjoying the stream, don't forget to leave a follow to keep updated of when I go live :)
[2022-12-10 11:39:54] <!%moshcraft> @roaringhillock YEP exactly but it's balanced because coins LUL
[2022-12-10 11:40:00] <walidkadaben> kill tyr with junior
[2022-12-10 11:40:00] <%berdel__> it can be good only with consume setup
[2022-12-10 11:40:08] <%+wifful> You can take tyr with junior
[2022-12-10 11:40:14] <%Pepe_Smile> you might also play caranthir but frost deck lacks the second targer
[2022-12-10 11:40:18] <%+theus_crw> if you have consumes on board at the ready, you can mitigate the rupture by eating them
[2022-12-10 11:40:24] <EscliveOfficial> That Speero fellow is kinda cute, not gonna lie peepoShy
[2022-12-10 11:40:33] <!%moshcraft> @berdel__ when was the last time you had two consumes just chilling in r1
[2022-12-10 11:41:02] <%berdel__> @moshcraft and who told you you ned use this card in R1?
[2022-12-10 11:41:15] <!%moshcraft> 12 p tutor to play an 8p card - 1 point YEP SOUNDS LIKE MO
[2022-12-10 11:41:39] <!%moshcraft> @berdel__ if you're using it in r3 you have to mulligan the targets
[2022-12-10 11:41:56] <%berdel__> I can use it in R2 :)
[2022-12-10 11:42:05] <%+theus_crw> lul
[2022-12-10 11:42:11] <+RoaringHillock> the card already costs a bajillion provs you don't want to have to mulligan it on top of everything
[2022-12-10 11:42:27] <@^StreamElements> Looking for games, gadgets or hardware? find them all in one place at https://www.g2a.com/?gname=spyroza
[2022-12-10 11:42:48] <!%moshcraft> I'd rather play rodderick than omen
[2022-12-10 11:43:05] <%Lulucienne> But the art though PepeHands
[2022-12-10 11:43:13] <!%moshcraft> it's not even an organic card ICANT
[2022-12-10 11:43:27] <@^StreamElements> Ever wanted your own unique gwent voice-line? If you are a sub, you can request your own card quote. !subs for more info
[2022-12-10 11:43:48] <!%moshcraft> so if you play omen you have to run tome or oneiro otherwise you missed 12p
[2022-12-10 11:43:58] <%berdel__> imagine this would be an echo
[2022-12-10 11:44:06] <+RoaringHillock> yeah MTG used to be quite good but really Gwent's so much better
[2022-12-10 11:44:28] <!%moshcraft> @berdel__ hmmm sounds like an sk card i know but we don't want playable mo cards
[2022-12-10 11:44:37] <walidkadaben> play it before he close the row
[2022-12-10 11:44:40] <Halowski> Spyro, your talking about old card graphics right ? instantly when new graphic came in it was shocking to me how bad they are(the new one)
[2022-12-10 11:44:47] <%Lulucienne> Harlad will ping Prayge
[2022-12-10 11:44:56] <%berdel__> @moshcraft yep spyrozaThisIsFine

[2022-12-10 11:45:42] <+RoaringHillock> the only card that stands out as being kinda bad for me is the aretuza student
[2022-12-10 11:45:51] <+RoaringHillock> at least it's the only one I can think of
[2022-12-10 11:45:52] <Halowski> way better the old ones
[2022-12-10 11:46:05] <!%moshcraft> @halowski can you give an example?

[2022-12-10 13:41:28] <%+Benelioto> snap is the correct answer, gwent players too stubborn to admit it

[2022-12-10 13:42:31] <@%+xahverius> Benelioto what does it have the numbers though? I used to view a streamer that went with snap looong ago but yet I always see him with same viewers (around 100)
[2022-12-10 13:42:39] <%BAPreda> there's 3 certainties in a spyro stream: getting streamsniped, getting highrolled and the expected shashank takes that makes less sense than opponent's plays
[2022-12-10 13:42:44] <@%+xahverius> he had like always 300 with gwent
[2022-12-10 13:43:03] <%+Benelioto> @xahverius every streamer i saw move to snap has at least same viewership if not more
[2022-12-10 13:43:03] <Kessman5> snap seems too cartoonish
[2022-12-10 13:43:27] <%+Benelioto> if you're talking about speki, his viewership dropped because of his terrible streaming schedule
[2022-12-10 13:43:29] <@hippotompotomus> Benelioto i'm pretty sure speci has less until he gets hosted
[2022-12-10 13:43:37] <%+Benelioto> see above

[2022-12-10 16:30:04] <%shinmiri2> so far it looks like enslave 6/Double Cross Torres Skellen deck, or warriors Tyr @johnnyriso but you can do it with a lot of stuff
[2022-12-10 16:30:51] <hyperion100> just play NG and you get to pro ez
