[2023-01-06 02:03:04] <%ADL1337> GIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image manipulation and image editing, free-form drawing, transcoding between different image file formats, and more specialized tasks. It is not designed to be used for drawing, though some artists and creators have used it for such.

Complacency of any kind is how people get hurt doing dangerous things. The more you do it the more complacent you get. Regardless, I'm glad it only ended in stitches and that you are okay.

[2023-01-06 21:56:50] <%$huntsman_of_atlas> Basically if you combine liquid nitrogen with ice cream, the ice cream can get powdery and when you consume it you can blow out breath fog like a dragon
