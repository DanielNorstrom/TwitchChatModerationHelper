[2022-12-20 13:20:19] <@%^Nightbot> @mr_deafult  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-20 13:29:13] <%miguelito420> 4090 really only makes sense if you're running 4K or multi-monitor
[2022-12-20 13:29:18] <%Lonigus> @SyNcZeni i think its your RAM lacking and chrom is peaking the ram/cpu usage at time which can cause the sudden drops. I have the same when i play CoD.

[2022-12-20 13:52:37] <%$mistakesweremiad> gaming PCs produce an on-screen image by way of the CPU processing data ‚Äì textures, shaders and the like ‚Äì from the graphics card‚Äôs frame buffer. Usually the CPU can only access this buffer in 256MB read blocks,Resizable BAR essentially makes the entirety of the graphics frame buffer accessible to the CPU at once.

[2022-12-20 15:28:19] <reformed_d4nny> @ImSoBurr_ im sitting on 3600x rn, maybe ill change it for 7700x in next year or 5800x3d idk for now
[2022-12-20 15:28:33] <Dennset> i was playing one day and restartet the game and after that i good insame frame drops und now why?
[2022-12-20 15:28:35] <%$Xv_Ruckus_vX> Have you gone into .exe and changed usable cores to actual core count?
[2022-12-20 15:28:35] <@%ImSoBurr_> @reformed_d4nny imo wait for 7x3d series, those will be monsters
[2022-12-20 15:28:37] <@%ImSoBurr_> SeemsGood
[2022-12-20 15:28:45] <reformed_d4nny> @ImSoBurr_ cuz 7700x is sick but prices of mobo and ddr5's
[2022-12-20 15:28:49] <syrros> KEKW its high end gpus settings dont matter that much its game that is being bad optimized

[2022-12-20 15:29:07] <@%ImSoBurr_> @reformed_d4nny Exactly, if you wait a lil bit it will be cheaper for sure

[2022-12-20 15:30:07] <%+MrSergo15> @Axel_tv from some guys on Reddit "They really fucked up with one of the updates because high textures enforce some kind of shadow preset which wasn't the case before. Back then high textures meant more VRAM consumption, nothing else was toggled with it."

[2022-12-20 15:57:26] <%+MrSergo15> @MrDrip66 At this point probably. AI is just a long ass decision tree and given how it uhh evolved through the years, it's very spaghetti now LUL
[2022-12-20 15:57:51] <Cosmonaht> Starting my first wipe ever. Very excited. Hopefully I can stay patient until I get decent at the game
[2022-12-20 15:58:14] <%+MrSergo15> Will shoot you if I see you in a raid @Cosmonaht :)
[2022-12-20 15:58:23] <+callmedurk> Is it 1 hit kill?
[2022-12-20 15:58:23] <%MrDrip66> @MrDrip66 yeah programming AI to be human-like and make their own decisions just like players is extremely difficult. Highly doubt this will be a thing in games for a long while.
[2022-12-20 15:58:24] <%+MrSergo15> <3
[2022-12-20 15:58:27] <Cosmonaht> from what I've seen, it'll take more than 1 wipe to get comfortable

[2022-12-20 15:59:32] <%+MrSergo15> @MrDrip66 True, then again EFT's AI is not in the least human like. More than react to outside information it just does what it does on a timer. Randomly checks mags, moves, eats, etc.
[2022-12-20 16:00:13] <gamingbamboo> and then suddenly they peak you like a pmc

[2022-12-20 16:03:28] <%MrDrip66> @MrDrip66 yeah that is why you see every AI like they are. Everything they do have to be explained to them in some form of a sentence. Like do this and this. It cannot make up it's own mind in any way. Of course you can add a billion lines to an AI to make it react differently to everything, but again cannot do something it is not told to do you know.
[2022-12-20 16:04:52] <thbskneees> @axel_tv do you think 2k monitor on tarkov will lead to more gun fights won in raid?

[2022-12-20 16:05:36] <%MrDrip66> @SuperPants229 At that point it is  no longer AI, but a human character. Pretty close to what player scavs already are. AI are there to make games more immersive I suppose and to fill up the games a bit more and make them seem more full and populated than they really are.

[2022-12-20 17:20:37] <Noduska> @Cosmonaht depends. i struggled with quests that needed PMC kills. but if you dont max traders asap, others will and theyll have better gear than you, and then youre behind again

[2022-12-20 17:48:44] <%sharp_water> is there a new event today?
[2022-12-20 17:48:48] <+abumusafps> @odonsta a lot of people say this, but it's not completely accurate. If you're running 144ghz monitor at 200 frames, you have a better, more recent pool to pull from though you only refresh 144 times a second. To say that you should cap your frames at 144 just isn't accurate. I'd rather have a pool of 200 frames to pull from. The idea assumes that your frames are generating at the same time your screen is refreshing.
[2022-12-20 17:48:48] <!%Tiagoonl> oh boy here comes the discussion
[2022-12-20 17:48:49] <+zapjrr> @a_dragon_raised_by_wolves it's a cpu, google it ryzen 7 5800x3d

[2022-12-20 17:51:23] <@%ImSoBurr_> It's as simple as this: refresh rate is how many times your monitor can refresh the image on screen. FPS is how many frames your GPU can spit out to the display every second.

[2022-12-20 17:53:05] <Nek0r> @Royskeelv grants its labs, so that's why he was testing in offline. But if you activate AI's it will tank your fps cuz ur cpu is doing all the work as a server would. You can try this out on customs for example

[2022-12-20 17:54:35] <+abumusafps> every time I see a streamer cap their fps at their refresh rate my braincells die.....

[2022-12-20 17:54:46] <!%ItzPyroGG> you can easily test this out by capping your fps to your monitor, and uncapping it, the smoothness and input lag
[2022-12-20 17:54:47] <+zapjrr> basically if you have more fps than the refresh rate you'll also have better input lag
[2022-12-20 17:54:47] <%aysishers> did you guys know that sometimes fps can break some games?
[2022-12-20 17:54:56] <+zapjrr> exactly

[2022-12-20 17:55:23] <%$kiris95> so, the opposite: what's the benefit of having an high refresh rate monitor, like 300 MHz?
[2022-12-20 17:55:24] <@%ImSoBurr_> kiris95 I mean, I am probably going to do a bad job of explaining it so bear with me, but it's like refresh rate is the fps of your monitor. So, for instance let's say you have 144hz, you can think of it as your monitor checking 144 times each second to refresh the display. So, higher refresh rate means it is checking more often
[2022-12-20 17:55:32] <!%ItzPyroGG> google: difference between hz and fps YEP
[2022-12-20 17:55:32] <+Fluxar> i think what he means is you wont notice a difference on your 120hz monitor if your getting 120 frames or 300 frames, sure it will feel smoother in game but no difference in your display
[2022-12-20 17:55:43] <%+impactblu_> im hesitant on the new amd gpus but the 3000 are dropping in price a lot so might get a 3000 series instead

[2022-12-20 18:35:40] <%PawniacWasTaken> I've found the MDRs, both 5.56 and .308 to be very controllable in terms of recoil

[2022-12-20 18:37:41] <thereal_takenotes> @Cosmonaht no usually mid to end of a raid

[2022-12-20 18:38:24] <Cosmonaht> Thanks, chat!!
[2022-12-20 18:38:26] <+AgedCilantro> @Cosmonaht depends on the map   Some maps like lighthouse and interchange can have player scavs with like 30 minutes remaining whereas Customs typically under 20 minutes
[2022-12-20 18:38:28] <ALTernateFox> NATAHTARI
[2022-12-20 18:38:38] <DerGorro> do you use the stanard m4 for the first raids? I think the default gasblock makes it unplayable
[2022-12-20 18:38:45] <%+hendothemaniac> @Cosmonaht AI scavs can be up immediately and player scavs are usually med to end in waves.
