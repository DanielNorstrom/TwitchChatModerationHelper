[2022-12-22 00:03:02] <@%Pallydan9K> that's about it
[2022-12-22 00:03:08] <%Hulken_Hurricane> one thing i noticed when going new game plus, is that i can invade anywhere that i was on the last playthrough without getting all the graces on ng+
[2022-12-22 00:03:17] <%Hulken_Hurricane> i think
[2022-12-22 00:03:18] <rostislavoskolkov> I bet this build will end up having moonveil Kappa LUL
[2022-12-22 00:03:35] <!%$NashquttinLittleWolf> you can do this in 10 minutes with mods now
[2022-12-22 00:03:39] <torremagica> but it's also cool to actually do it the legit way, gives you something to do
[2022-12-22 00:03:40] <@%Pallydan9K> You can invade leyndell and ashen leyndell after NG+ oroJAM
[2022-12-22 00:03:41] <%+i_have_crab> Once all the DLC is out it would be nice to see another type of "Cinders" mod for this game
[2022-12-22 00:03:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @rostislavoskolkov He'll end up with a Nagakiba. Oro's usually good with sticking to builds.
[2022-12-22 00:04:14] <%Hulken_Hurricane> i like watching both :D
[2022-12-22 00:04:17] <%+i_have_crab> If you want the PvE to be more interesting then handicap yourself.
[2022-12-22 00:04:20] <wolvenedvhart> Oro, have you tried level 200 colosseum/invasions?
[2022-12-22 00:04:22] <%LuminArcTech> People just don't like touching grace oroSmug
[2022-12-22 00:04:22] <KnightVito> @i_have_crab There's already a Convergence mod in the works for ER.
[2022-12-22 00:04:31] <%$Illuna_Meira> your mic settings are better than the stream you first tried the new mic
[2022-12-22 00:04:36] <%whitebat_ivi> i hope the DLC is fucking massive oroPraise

[2022-12-22 00:06:16] <%+i_have_crab> I got more fights in the 260 bracket than in the 200 brackert
[2022-12-22 00:06:16] <%$Illuna_Meira> they say there was a theory about Loretta being unable to walk but after that crash this is more than a theory

[2022-12-22 00:20:26] <+Bilbo_B4ggins> best level to invade is 90, agree?
[2022-12-22 00:20:29] <%i_have_crab> NO
[2022-12-22 00:20:29] <johnnyriso> In my Zeus build Im at 160 for the pvp meta and so I can only get 55 dex and 55 faith 🥲

[2022-12-22 00:21:13] <@%Pallydan9K> I've been hurting a lot of people at lv33 lately
[2022-12-22 00:21:13] <wolvenedvhart> lol

[2022-12-22 00:21:22] <%i_have_crab> I pvp at 260 so its all subjective

[2022-12-22 00:21:44] <johnnyriso> @solpice I think most are between 120 and 160

[2022-12-22 00:21:56] <$Solpice> I see
[2022-12-22 00:22:03] <%i_have_crab> Invading within 200+ you wont barely find anyone
[2022-12-22 00:22:09] <%i_have_crab> But colesseum is poppin
[2022-12-22 00:22:11] <@%Pallydan9K> I made a 132 specifically because it invades starting from 91
[2022-12-22 00:22:27] <Marshmallum> I'm weird and invade at 110 and works out great for me LUL
[2022-12-22 00:22:33] <+Bilbo_B4ggins> does it matter the weapon upgrades or it's only character levels?

[2022-12-22 00:23:05] <fush06> if you're invading at 110 you're probably gonna meet mainly 125s

[2022-12-22 00:23:10] <johnnyriso> With Vigor at 60 being a must for pvp, I think 150 is the most logical pvp meta

[2022-12-22 00:23:16] <rostislavoskolkov> Question is, at what level does Miyazaki PVP? Kappa

[2022-12-22 00:23:33] <%i_have_crab> Cheer100  Have you ever considered a character as high as level 250? Its not as bad as you think. Lots of variety to builds.
[2022-12-22 00:23:35] <@%Pallydan9K> I tried using the nightrider glaive but there just wasn't enough benefit from the five more units of weight
[2022-12-22 00:23:39] <%Hulken_Hurricane> i actually enjoy using the things that are not the meta even if it means ill lose alot more XD

[2022-12-22 00:24:04] <@%Pallydan9K> Level 301 invades up to 713 btw
[2022-12-22 00:24:10] <%Kaine_san> the worst thing is invadfing sweatlords in rykards cave
[2022-12-22 00:24:17] <MANSHREK> Level 477 is good :)
[2022-12-22 00:24:19] <%i_have_crab> Level 301 reaslly invades up to 713?
[2022-12-22 00:24:29] <@%Pallydan9K> 301 really invades up that far, Oro tested it
[2022-12-22 00:24:36] <%i_have_crab> At that point why not just max to 713?
[2022-12-22 00:24:39] <$Solpice> Guess I'll work on my main lvl 387 Kappa
[2022-12-22 00:24:43] <@%Pallydan9K> You can invade farther down with 301
[2022-12-22 00:24:48] <Marshmallum> If I was going to go to 200 I would just do that instead tbh
[2022-12-22 00:24:48] <wolvenedvhart> What about level 175 lol?
[2022-12-22 00:24:50] <%$Illuna_Meira> @i_have_crab so you can invade down

[2022-12-22 00:27:06] <%i_have_crab> I perfer 250+ cause you can mix most caster builds with melee and it makes for a fun match
[2022-12-22 00:27:08] <+Thorogrimm> Your talismans and loadout matter more in a lot of cases
[2022-12-22 00:27:12] <YourSponsor_> but i NEED rennala moon and elden stars and bullgoat and quality katar

[2022-12-22 00:27:15] <fush06> problem with builds is that hybrid builds can't exist without 150 but pure at 150 is absolutely cracked in damage

[2022-12-22 00:38:52] <@%Pallydan9K> Elden ring is still fresh
[2022-12-22 00:38:59] <Roanuke> The ole iron bridge
[2022-12-22 00:38:59] <NascentCards> Dark Souls 2 had the Puzzle Sword which is the most fun weapon a souls game has ever had IMO
[2022-12-22 00:39:02] <@%Pallydan9K> well, maybe it's not warm anymore
[2022-12-22 00:39:02] <+MergosWetDream> maybe ds2 pvp is fun to play but to watch its a snoozefest
[2022-12-22 00:39:03] <+Banal_Retentive> DS2 is GOAT
[2022-12-22 00:39:04] <rostislavoskolkov> Like that toy story meme: I dont want to play with you anymore LUL

[2022-12-22 00:39:15] <%+tired_games> ds2 had all the cool samurai type stuff

[2022-12-22 00:40:49] <+Thorogrimm> Was OG DS2 any better than Scholar?
[2022-12-22 00:40:51] <NascentCards> If Bloodborne had normal invasions man that would just be oh so fucking amazing
[2022-12-22 00:40:52] <%i_have_crab> Elden ring dlc is probably gonna be the biggest ever released
[2022-12-22 00:40:57] <+Eighth_and_Mass> people dislike the elevator in ds2, but all the games have illogical transitions between zones
[2022-12-22 00:40:58] <+pdhNaz> @gladosinthemoon wait for the dlc featuring even more Ranni
[2022-12-22 00:40:59] <torremagica> because twitch was starting to get promo in the app store and other ways
[2022-12-22 00:41:00] <wolvenedvhart> I hope in lots more moveset variety
[2022-12-22 00:41:05] <!%Ebonslayer> @Thorogrimm Debatable. Some things were better, others worse.

[2022-12-22 00:53:54] <!%Ebonslayer> @Hulken_Hurricane There's two people who AFK farm: people who don't know it's incredibly inefficient and trolls.
[2022-12-22 00:53:55] <Zreaper_> the AFK farmers are usually never AFK, they are just there because they like griefing people

[2022-12-22 00:54:02] <shadowblight7> @Hulken_Hurricane IGN said its good for farming runes so people grief the online play
[2022-12-22 00:54:12] <CriticalBip> What do you want to see in the dlc?
[2022-12-22 00:54:14] <shadowblight7> pretty much its for griefing only and not even a rune farm
[2022-12-22 00:54:15] <wolvenedvhart> Remember to pick up Latenna before Consecrated Fields

[2022-12-22 00:54:58] <!%Ebonslayer> @CriticalBip A catalyst weapon AoW. That's literally it.
[2022-12-22 00:54:59] <Zreaper_> @Hulken_Hurricane 99% of AFK farmers are not AFK and just don't like the PvP in this game so they grief it for other people

[2022-12-22 00:57:35] <%moefee> does anyone think that rivers needs a buff? Im not sure my self how they would other then damage

[2022-12-22 00:57:41] <+Thorogrimm> If they added the black blade from DS3 into this game that would be cool
[2022-12-22 00:57:48] <CriticalBip> Rot weapons would be cool
[2022-12-22 00:57:55] <@%Pallydan9K> it has ARMOR, AoE, goes through walls, and pulls people off cliffs
[2022-12-22 00:58:06] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> yes only physical
[2022-12-22 00:58:08] <val_draconis> im kinda surprised malikeths black blade doesnt just have deathblight on it since its the weapon that can kill the gods itd be basically pointless but itd be funny to see
[2022-12-22 00:58:10] <%Calpernius> @moefee why should it be buffed?
[2022-12-22 00:58:42] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> yeah I like Coded so much, and busted
[2022-12-22 00:58:43] <shadowblight7> only difference would be the r2
[2022-12-22 00:58:44] <%$Illuna_Meira> @pallydan9k and pull depends on the velocity of people too so it's good to throw people off of cliffs while getting chased like a dog
[2022-12-22 00:58:48] <%ubermorph935> I hope upcoming DLCs will bring more
[2022-12-22 00:58:51] <%moefee> @Calpernius I personaly just feel like its been nerfed abit too much
[2022-12-22 00:58:52] <fush06> have you done coded invasions yet
[2022-12-22 00:58:54] <!%Ebonslayer> @moefee I think it's in a good place. It's what it was unnerfed if you hit with the blade.
[2022-12-22 00:59:05] <@%Pallydan9K> @Illuna_Meira ooo so that's why that happens
[2022-12-22 00:59:05] <%i_have_crab> How is it bugged

[2022-12-22 00:59:13] <shadowblight7> thats the big question
[2022-12-22 00:59:19] <wolvenedvhart> I would love more customisation options for armours and helmets. Remove horns, change colour, change magerial, stuff like that.
[2022-12-22 00:59:21] <%moefee> @Calpernius mind you I dont want how it use to be back
[2022-12-22 00:59:27] <ungarette> im trying poison build for pvp, but on high levels u kill ppl before proccing the poison. Its better to try on low levels or i just give up?
[2022-12-22 00:59:28] <fush06> yeah holy liver is 35% negation iirc
[2022-12-22 00:59:34] <%$Illuna_Meira> @pallydan9k yee the faster they are the harder they'll be pulled it's hilariously good mechanic actually

[2022-12-22 00:59:37] <!%Ebonslayer> @moefee It's effectively a much better double slash with some added mid-range chip.
[2022-12-22 00:59:50] <wolvenedvhart> I would love more customisation options for armours and helmets. Remove horns, change colour, change material, stuff like that.*
[2022-12-22 00:59:50] <DTPandemonium1> I think that's not a bug
[2022-12-22 00:59:52] <%Calpernius> @moefee you’re probably right, it could maybe use a minor buff in sone way so it’s at least usable in PVP. But it’s still good in PVE if you need bleed
[2022-12-22 00:59:54] <DTPandemonium1> it's been like that since release
[2022-12-22 00:59:56] <DTPandemonium1> I swear

[2022-12-22 01:00:09] <%moefee> @moefee does the blade do damage on the weapon art too ?
[2022-12-22 01:00:11] <fush06> @dtpandemonium1 it's a bug because it's unreasonable and not like the other livers
[2022-12-22 01:00:14] <%CMDRHarper> I can understand how thats a tall order though
[2022-12-22 01:00:22] <shadowblight7> @CMDRHarper won't ever be a thing because of pc hackers corrupting saves
[2022-12-22 01:00:31] <%$Illuna_Meira> yes I think it was that way
[2022-12-22 01:00:31] <eatingpotatoes25> are you gonna do DLC on NG+7 for first time?
[2022-12-22 01:00:35] <%CMDRHarper> @CMDRHarper Thought they fixed that
[2022-12-22 01:00:43] <shadowblight7> they can't fix all issues
[2022-12-22 01:00:45] <EwesNah> nope, all of them die every run through
[2022-12-22 01:00:57] <shadowblight7> they fixed the major exploit on pc recently
[2022-12-22 01:01:03] <!%Ebonslayer> @moefee Yeah. What the nerf did was it reduced the damage of the blood slashes. It actually made the sword itself during the Weapon Art more powerful, which was sorta undone with the blanket AoW damage nerf.

[2022-12-22 01:01:29] <val_draconis> im leaving my NG+7 character before burning the tree down incase for some reason the DLC entrance is in the Golden capital instead of the Ashen

[2022-12-22 01:02:02] <%$Illuna_Meira> I just don't remember T^T some bell bearings passed to ng+ but which ones I forgot, and even so it was added in game in later patches too
[2022-12-22 01:02:07] <eatingpotatoes25> which build are you gonna do DLC for first time?

[2022-12-22 01:02:23] <shadowblight7> @KayleNikita you missed servers going down because there was a exploit that let hackers take over other peoples computers? you live under a rock?
[2022-12-22 01:02:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @moefee Currently, if you hit with the blade during Corpse Piler it's only slightly weaker than old pre-nerf RoB, but only if you hit with the blade.
[2022-12-22 01:02:44] <wolvenedvhart> I would like also to be able to change colours on weapons
[2022-12-22 01:02:59] <!%KayleNikita> @shadowblight7 wait, i thought they fixed that exploit BEFORE Elden Ring came out.....
[2022-12-22 01:03:11] <shadowblight7> @KayleNikita they did for elden ring

[2022-12-22 01:03:20] <!%Ebonslayer> @moefee It makes it a super mean roll catch weapon in the right hands, since those two slashes will still proc bleed 90% of the time and do absurd damage.

[2022-12-22 01:07:45] <+Thorogrimm> How come nobody uses ice spear in pvp?
[2022-12-22 01:07:59] <@%Pallydan9K> Ice spear is slow
[2022-12-22 01:08:00] <wolvenedvhart> @shadowblight7 At 125 yes

[2022-12-22 01:08:08] <Morber_Bot> To make it authentic they should make the show protagonist completely mute, yet for some reason everyone talks to them
[2022-12-22 01:08:08] <shadowblight7> ;-;
[2022-12-22 01:08:14] <fush06> everyone uses ice spear for duel pvp

[2022-12-22 01:08:44] <@%Pallydan9K> if someone is getting hit by ice spear then they need to figure out how to not get hit by it
[2022-12-22 01:08:44] <val_draconis> @fush06 i almost never see it is it really that strong?
[2022-12-22 01:09:06] <val_draconis> cause it feels really easy to dodge

[2022-12-22 01:09:22] <wolvenedvhart> Nah, people have to free aim with it
[2022-12-22 01:09:28] <shadowblight7> @val_draconis I'd prefer a bigger blackflame fireball and some nice ashes of war
[2022-12-22 01:09:40] <shadowblight7> I love the little ring blackflame spell for crowd control
[2022-12-22 01:09:47] <shadowblight7> but nothing else really blends well for a pvp build

[2022-12-22 01:13:50] <fush06> @shadowblight7  too long for a speedy buff, though drawstring is 14 so something that takes slightly more longer to cast shouldn't be 7

[2022-12-22 01:16:07] <Austinkane> @ebonslayer @illuna_meira what's the point of writing code on paper? it's not like the paper is gonna perform the code
[2022-12-22 01:16:09] <!%Ebonslayer> @Illuna_Meira It makes no sense at all. You can't run it on a piece of paper to see if the code works, you have to eyeball everything to grade it.
[2022-12-22 01:16:14] <shadowblight7> wait
[2022-12-22 01:16:27] <shadowblight7> your saying rivers of blood WASN'T broken at first?

[2022-12-22 01:16:44] <shadowblight7> then it was made arcane which broke it
[2022-12-22 01:16:44] <@%Pallydan9K> yo I hate to tell it to you but RoB was never really broken
[2022-12-22 01:16:50] <shadowblight7> then they fixed it and it was balance wise broken
[2022-12-22 01:16:50] <%CMDRHarper> RoB was honest in 1.0 because it didn't work yet lol
[2022-12-22 01:16:52] <fush06> rivers was actually a joke weapon at launch, because it was glitched
[2022-12-22 01:16:52] <val_draconis> and im still using the godslayer to this point actually
[2022-12-22 01:16:52] <wolvenedvhart> I wish Royal GS had Ludwig’s Holy Blade moveset from Bloodborne but adjusted for Souls Combat. Favourite weapon.
[2022-12-22 01:16:59] <shadowblight7> I mean legit broken
[2022-12-22 01:17:04] <YourSponsor_> yeah on release arcane didnt scale a lot of stuff so rivers didnt deal much bleed

[2022-12-22 01:51:52] <@%Pallydan9K> halberds are very one dimensional
[2022-12-22 01:51:58] <RorBoy> Golden or Banished are the best ones
[2022-12-22 01:52:03] <+Thorogrimm> Halberds are so much slower in this compared to DS3
[2022-12-22 01:52:03] <wolvenedvhart> I preferred Sekiro PvP ;)

[2022-12-22 01:52:33] <a1splashyy> is that the armor set from killing knight istav
[2022-12-22 01:52:33] <Tripfriend> Completed the game with swordspear, favorite one for usre
[2022-12-22 01:52:33] <suspiciouslymissingsock> THe Veteran greaves actually go really good with the scaled chest

[2022-12-22 02:35:13] <%+NotSpartanJake> Taking slightly more lightning damage with that

I decided to stick to at least 50 for deathblight due to having low too much of a vigor due to shotel requirements, but yes 30 is easier to deathblight, SLIGHTLY easier

[2022-12-22 02:51:31] <RotEater> @RotEater I mean, what I did to put both the shotel and mist was 17 vigor, 15 dex, 18 int, and 23 faith. I had to throw Radagon's Soreseal on with Star-Gazer's, Two Fingers, and Prosthesis-Wearer's, but it let me mess around.

[2022-12-22 02:56:17] <%$Illuna_Meira> @roteater oh those are your base stats without the addition of all talisman extras then, I don't remember what I did but I remember I dropped 30 to have poise at 50 with still having mist and shotels once, at 30 it's impossible to achieve all of them, vigor, poise, shotel, mist.. I know I want too much for a low level char oroLUL

[2022-12-22 02:57:03] <FutureHexagons> I thought soreseal was one of the top trinkets in ER?
[2022-12-22 02:57:07] <%$Illuna_Meira> it is acceptable at 70 I think

[2022-12-22 02:57:16] <RushHS> according to the wiki soreseal stops being a net positive after lvl 80
[2022-12-22 02:57:26] <ZoomerFrog> Soreseal is one of the trinkets of all time

[2022-12-22 02:57:44] <FutureHexagons> Ahhhh had no clue
[2022-12-22 02:57:54] <%$Illuna_Meira> if its fextra there is an exact level with no reason
[2022-12-22 02:58:04] <DTPandemonium1> if the damage numbers on the wiki is correct the more damage you take from a single hit the worse soreseal gets
[2022-12-22 02:58:06] <YourSponsor_> if you're not getting massive value from 3 of the 4 stat boosts, it isn't even worth considering
[2022-12-22 02:58:07] <fush06> sleep is more of an arcane thing except from trinas @ebonslayer
[2022-12-22 02:58:08] <RushHS> yeah i took it with a grain of salt obviously
[2022-12-22 02:58:10] <DTPandemonium1> but it's fextra Kappa

[2022-12-22 02:58:39] <Komugi_> The soreseals are only good as long as you get the same hp boost as the damage penalty

[2022-12-22 02:58:44] <fush06> and the pots can proc sleep pretty fast

[2022-12-22 02:59:05] <+ForkMuffin> at later levels soreseal kills you more than it helps you
