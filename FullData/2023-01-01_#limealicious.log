[2023-01-01 01:15:28] <TheHylianGuard> I think the overall gameplay feels better in 2
[2023-01-01 01:15:28] <%+Outlulz> 2 is better balanced and no 15 minute long bad stages

[2023-01-01 01:15:35] <%thatcrazycrabs> I love the flashiness of Bayo 2, but Bayo 1 has the better depth
[2023-01-01 01:15:39] <%Cammy0896> I wonder if someone could hook up one of those haptic feedback things and make it works with TITS

[2023-01-01 20:34:16] <@%Greygull> Hauling is always a low priority task, unfortunately

[2023-01-01 20:34:46] <%shagoliravioli> not a bad idea to give hauling jobs to any performers you may have
[2023-01-01 20:34:49] <%$peekas0> Dwarf Therapist let you set priorities.

[2023-01-01 20:35:03] <%BestyVT> @peekas0 ah, I did use Dwarf Therapist :)
[2023-01-01 20:35:04] <%arctangentX> in older DF versions you used to be able to micromanage each individual dwarf's labors and have a bunch of dwarves set to ONLY do hauling and nothing else
[2023-01-01 20:35:05] <@%Greygull> Dwarf Therapist by default did not let you do that, it's possible DFHack mods could've added that functionality
[2023-01-01 20:35:07] <%RocketOcelot> @peekas0 is there a DT out for 50.4 yet?
[2023-01-01 20:35:10] <%SlimyGooblin> it's worth more than wood probably

[2023-01-01 20:35:47] <%$peekas0> @RocketOcelot I don't really keep track of DF stuff, but probably not.
[2023-01-01 20:35:52] <futilefreedom> Some dorf was probably standing there when another tried to build it.

[2023-01-01 20:36:39] <%$Ben_Couch> What killed those dwarves?

[2023-01-01 20:36:51] <%SlimyGooblin> it's good for warhammers
[2023-01-01 20:36:53] <%shagoliravioli> silver makes EXCELLENT blunt weapons
[2023-01-01 20:36:54] <%RocketOcelot> I'm hoping they make DT a mod for the new UI

[2023-01-01 20:37:11] <%earin_copper> Blunt weapon damage is determined by weight, and silver is v heavy
[2023-01-01 20:37:15] <%arctangentX> silver can't hold an edge worth shit but it's pretty heavy so it makes good bludgeoning weapons
[2023-01-01 20:37:16] <%+Zakaluka15> silver is good for finished goods as well. goblets, toys, instruments, all really great for trade. also blunt weapons

[2023-01-01 20:37:16] <%SlimyGooblin> yea but platinum is artifact only

[2023-01-01 20:37:44] <haploekun> I believe hauling covers all hauling jobs, whereas refuse hauling will need a new labor list

[2023-01-01 21:12:39] <%SlimyGooblin> warhammers are better against armor I think

[2023-01-01 21:12:46] <%arctangentX> warhammers are more likely to break bones through armor, maces are more likely to completely mangle and pulp unarmored body parts
[2023-01-01 21:12:53] <Escavalx> Maces let you you use shields too right?
[2023-01-01 21:13:05] <%Spylon> Does that mean maces are better vs undead btw? @arctangentX
[2023-01-01 21:13:06] <SlipperyElm> @arctangentX So you're saying dual wield :^)
[2023-01-01 21:13:09] <%SlimyGooblin> you can use shields with hammers too usually
[2023-01-01 21:13:12] <%Tirien66> spears are best for big enemies like dragons

[2023-01-01 21:21:16] <Spie812> Question for chat: Are tombs a requirement in the new version? I always just had a room full of coffins.
[2023-01-01 21:21:29] <Jonkku> Dead people with lost bodies you make a slab for still claim and "waste" a coffin

[2023-01-01 21:21:41] <%$AzumaMagica> @Spie812 Zoning them is a bit more janky but you can have a room with coffins, you just need to zone each one.

[2023-01-01 21:47:07] <BarbaricSpaceWhale> I think aquifers will actually leak water forever, so you have to find a way to excise the aquifer entirely if it's even possible
[2023-01-01 21:47:08] <%shagoliravioli> @bunglinglummox vermin pets OP, they chill in the inventory and hang out on the owner's head and shoulders without needing food

[2023-01-01 22:18:00] <%BestyVT> yeah dunno about newer versions but encrusting stuff that's guaranteed to get claimed by dwarves was generally not as good as furniture
[2023-01-01 22:18:10] <%+Zakaluka15> @pyrobol it's more than that, sometimes they will have a "favorite goblet" or something they claim for themself, it gives a permanent happy memory

[2023-01-01 22:27:14] <%ughdontmakemeregister> iron crossbows is probably the most material efficient because they shouldnt be smacking people with them in the first place, save steel for armor and melee weapons (and bolts)
[2023-01-01 22:27:16] <%bunglinglummox> @shagoliravioli Yeah, fortress mode only lets you *make* them from leather. But dwarven civs have them made of cloth everywhere outside your own fort. It's weird.

[2023-01-01 22:27:39] <ZephyrZx> i guess your civilization doesn't know how to make silver crossbows? mine doesn't know how to make high boots

[2023-01-01 22:28:17] <ZephyrZx> why do i keep seeing people recommend silver/steel crossbows

[2023-01-01 22:28:45] <%bunglinglummox> @ZephyrZx they're probably just using warhammer logic, since melee crossbows use the hammer skill

[2023-01-01 22:28:53] <%RocketOcelot> there's a mod on steam to give all the dwarves big boobs
[2023-01-01 22:28:55] <%SlimyGooblin> @ZephyrZx for when your marksdwarves inevitably decide to charge in and use their crossbows like a hammer
[2023-01-01 22:28:59] <DMPhobos> @ZephyrZx iirc silver is good for hitting things and if the marksdwarf runs out of ammo the use the crosswbow to hit things

[2023-01-01 22:29:05] <%$DragooKnight11> @zephyrzx crossbows double as hammers, if anything manages to close range they use hammerdwarf skills to club them to deth

[2023-01-01 22:30:46] <StromkoPenguin> @ZephyrZx People probably just forgot silver couldn't make that particular item. Silver's good for hammers, so people got their wires crossed I imagine.

[2023-01-01 23:07:48] <%$peekas0> the difference between Sean Murray and Peter Molyneux is that one actually decided to keep working on a game.

[2023-01-01 23:08:14] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> remember how Sean Murray made all those promises? and it took him 6 years to deliver 90% of them?

[2023-01-01 23:08:18] <%+SleepyCorpse_> No man sky also had all their hard drives flooded during development

[2023-01-01 23:08:43] <%LinkyWink> What about Fable 3
[2023-01-01 23:08:47] <%Charronia> Part of No Man's Sky's problem was marketing making wild claims without conferring with the devs
[2023-01-01 23:08:49] <DaveKap> @ThePooba .... and?
[2023-01-01 23:08:50] <squishiepeepz> yeah fable was still very good but it's a good joke

[2023-01-01 23:09:16] <%FourtyTwo424242> @OneManAgainstheOdds they deliver 100% of them and added on to it. It was mostly sony's fault for it he really was just a indie guy force into the light. Better then most AAA devs.

[2023-01-01 23:10:29] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> I'll play No Man's Sky when Sean Murray puts in that science-breaking rework of the periodic table that  causes atoms to refract in the NMS universe limesSip

[2023-01-01 23:13:25] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> @Dawnyan combination of factors. the numerous interviews done publically by sean murray, Sony pushing hucking fard for marketing despite the boon of financial backing.. and game journalists and the gaming community getting REALLY super hyped about Mo Nanny Sky

[2023-01-01 23:14:01] <%$peekas0> @YurbleTV you can retire a fort and make a new one, yes
[2023-01-01 23:14:01] <nicogerusan> they make the winner sing a contract that will give him 1% of profit of the next game, but they never give him a single penny, and the guy had to pay for his fly ticket to sing the contract

[2023-01-01 23:59:47] <%+Zakaluka15> if you have performance problems set the resolution down to 1080p.... you gain literally nothing from a higher resolution and it makes a bigger difference than any other setting
