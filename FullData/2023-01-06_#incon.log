[2023-01-06 00:03:55] <@%TubbyTheSatan> I mean l am good at solo
[2023-01-06 00:03:58] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Just get bored
[2023-01-06 00:04:01] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Playing it a lot
[2023-01-06 00:04:03] <%ninohundojuando> I imagine that would be fun for junglers
[2023-01-06 00:04:08] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Not really
[2023-01-06 00:04:12] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Solo is very different

[2023-01-06 00:04:54] <%ninohundojuando> Best ganks in that lane, imo
[2023-01-06 00:05:06] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Nah easier to gank mids and adc
[2023-01-06 00:05:20] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Unless the enemy solo wastes his ult on nothing most of the time
[2023-01-06 00:05:25] <%ninohundojuando> It’s just BONK, BONK, BONK to WOAHHHHHHH
[2023-01-06 00:05:36] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Bad solo only bonk
[2023-01-06 00:05:46] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Good solo clear wave, poke farm camps
[2023-01-06 00:05:51] <@%TubbyTheSatan> No way you can gank those a lot

[2023-01-06 00:06:53] <%ninohundojuando> Ok silly question, how do you frontline on a tangy non-frontline god?
[2023-01-06 00:07:11] <%ninohundojuando> Tanky
[2023-01-06 00:07:16] <@%TubbyTheSatan> If you want to frontline without really being tanky
[2023-01-06 00:07:27] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Most you can do is bait out abilities and trying to avoid those
[2023-01-06 00:07:35] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Pretend like you are going in
[2023-01-06 00:07:40] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Let the enemy waste stuff on you
[2023-01-06 00:07:57] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Any ult forced that doesnt really impact your hp too much or gets your actives burned is good
[2023-01-06 00:08:05] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Like l can play loki right?
[2023-01-06 00:08:09] <%ninohundojuando> Would Bastet be good for that?
[2023-01-06 00:08:12] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Blink in, auto combo the adc
[2023-01-06 00:08:15] <@%TubbyTheSatan> They use actives
[2023-01-06 00:08:19] <@%TubbyTheSatan> And l ult out
[2023-01-06 00:08:26] <@%TubbyTheSatan> My blink is worth less than their beads and aegis
[2023-01-06 00:08:40] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Bastet is fine if you just position well with the ult tbh

[2023-01-06 17:07:02] <%+lightforceten> i always think i'll do that with ama. then it turns out that ama dash cooldown is longer than anyone's clear
[2023-01-06 17:07:24] <%siv0r> jg going for 1 minute ku makes me so sad as a solo laner
[2023-01-06 17:07:37] <%+gabmontreuil> f6, no totem no winning
[2023-01-06 17:07:40] <%heterochromia98> @lightforceten And you end up dashing through them, messing up your positioining entirely

[2023-01-06 17:08:35] <%+lightforceten> all i know is there's no tack on my chair, and then he moves and there's a tack
[2023-01-06 17:08:38] <%+lightforceten> coincidence?

[2023-01-06 17:12:08] <%+lightforceten> especially since they changed the 2
[2023-01-06 17:12:23] <GoNnaBeLaTe> 2 pushing into your own tower is fun to watch the stuggle
[2023-01-06 17:12:30] <%siv0r> dash to avoid instead of silencing you, bold strategy
[2023-01-06 17:12:32] <%+DemonOfTheNorthSea> still like old Nike better but I know I'm in the minority on that one
[2023-01-06 17:12:34] <%seraph1232> solid gank imo

[2023-01-06 17:13:29] <+BamaMophi> I've never seen someone dash so much to dodge Nike 1
[2023-01-06 17:13:30] <%+nkingsmith> magnificent display of skill

[2023-01-06 17:14:25] <%Calvinman4> a couple times I think

[2023-01-06 17:14:36] <@%jguy85> @Incon i had someone tell me  i  did a good  job supporting back in season 2
[2023-01-06 17:14:47] <%+acraine1> @air2jodran3 I mean with her cleave autos and how strong berserks i could see it being fairly easy to pull off
[2023-01-06 17:14:48] <%+lightforceten> if you type something nice people will just assume it's sarcastic
[2023-01-06 17:14:48] <Chelios_x> I was expecting Thanatos too
[2023-01-06 17:14:53] <%Calvinman4> my favorite one was when my merc saved my life and then said "i'm here to run fast and eat ass"
[2023-01-06 17:15:01] <%+nkingsmith> Yesterday I played a game where a teammate individually called out every member of the team telling them they sucked for different reasons. Must take a lot of effort to do
[2023-01-06 17:15:02] <+BamaMophi> to be fair, I would have also assumed I was getting ganked after that support ulted me into nothing
[2023-01-06 17:15:12] <%siv0r> I hate the battle pass quests to say "You rock" because it just feels toxic to even say it
[2023-01-06 17:15:12] <%+Jagsman119> Ive seen plenty of “you rocks!” In the smite chat. Theyre often times followed by a “cancel that” but i think that’s unrelated
[2023-01-06 17:15:17] <%Calvinman4> and i'm all out of fast
[2023-01-06 17:15:25] <+LaronTheLion> Finally got Disney+! I am very overwhelmed by the amount of star wars content

[2023-01-06 18:14:16] <%+Andy1134> a bit optimistic dying only 9 times
[2023-01-06 18:14:17] <%Danger_Corpse> @incon You can switch out Poly for antiheal and move it up in the build. IF YOU WANT I GUESS.
[2023-01-06 18:14:23] <%psychictoad_> dont make that a challenge incon or so help me god
[2023-01-06 18:14:24] <%+TruePlewd> made even worse by the lane matchup
[2023-01-06 18:14:35] <+BamaMophi> I find it hilarious that they buffed shield of regrowth by giving it extremely minor power after you've used your heal which usually scales off of power
[2023-01-06 18:14:59] <mugi1wara> wallll
[2023-01-06 18:15:28] <%+tragicmike89> @incon, does it hurt?
[2023-01-06 18:15:33] <%+Ddogg1024> Sorry incon is was me I just was having a solo party in the parking lot and wanted Taco Bell
[2023-01-06 18:15:34] <%voyage_icarus> Is Mulan specifically a bad matchup for Artio, or just cuz its Mulan?
[2023-01-06 18:15:54] <%Danger_Corpse> Mulan is a pain in the ass.
[2023-01-06 18:15:58] <%+TruePlewd> @voyage_icarus yes

[2023-01-06 18:16:25] <+BamaMophi> it's because Artio isn't very good in the solo lane right now and Mulan is very good right now
[2023-01-06 18:16:33] <%+tragicmike89> YOU DID IT
[2023-01-06 18:16:38] <%+Andy1134> yeah you maul that sussano

[2023-01-06 18:16:45] <%+TruePlewd> Mulan and sca bad match up because she's basically physical Artio, but better and she can't be crippled.
[2023-01-06 18:16:48] <%voyage_icarus> Bet bet
[2023-01-06 18:16:49] <%Danger_Corpse> Shield of regrowth is the linchpin.
[2023-01-06 18:16:54] <%Danger_Corpse> That's your power spike.
[2023-01-06 18:17:04] <+BamaMophi> well time for me to try and win a game of Odin's Onslaught as Artio
[2023-01-06 18:17:06] <%+TruePlewd> Mulan is a bad match*
[2023-01-06 18:17:08] <%psychictoad_> that ult almost stole your minions

[2023-01-06 20:43:35] <%+acraine1> Only time I’ve eaten duck was in france and it was delicious
[2023-01-06 20:43:51] <%+B1ownVR> take that back @Jagsman119
[2023-01-06 20:43:52] <@%TubbyTheSatan> Duck is my fav protein
[2023-01-06 20:43:59] <%+acraine1> Better than… dry chicken?
[2023-01-06 20:44:13] <srclicky> 18 days for patch notes? or the day it gets updated?
[2023-01-06 20:44:26] <GoNnaBeLaTe> @srclicky notes on Friday of SPL
[2023-01-06 20:44:26] <@%TubbyTheSatan> The update @srclicky

[2023-01-06 20:44:40] <%+Jagsman119> Once i finish The League im going to start watching Alice in Borderlands
[2023-01-06 20:44:40] <%TheseGoodGames> duck is a bit gamier but if done right, definitely flavorful and tender.
[2023-01-06 20:44:41] <%+lightforceten> hard disagree

[2023-01-06 20:45:14] <+willyd333> @lightforceten I just finished this so I can answer. I didn't care for the "chess" game. It had potential but wasn't great
[2023-01-06 20:45:27] <%+acraine1> @jagsman119 the league!! What a great show
[2023-01-06 20:45:32] <+willyd333> Osmosis was my favorite
[2023-01-06 20:45:34] <%+lightforceten> @willyd333 that's the game he means by "tag
[2023-01-06 20:45:42] <valorant12454> when ever i read your name i read it as icon
[2023-01-06 20:45:48] <%+Jagsman119> @acraine1 im like in season 4 right now, its amazing

[2023-01-06 20:49:49] <%+Jagsman119> @incon did you watch Glass Onion?
[2023-01-06 20:49:54] <%heterochromia98> @aphoticaffinity Oooh that's what happened then. Damn. Only f6s today basically
[2023-01-06 20:50:07] <%AphoticAffinity> Glass Onion was meh.
[2023-01-06 20:50:15] <%psychictoad_> or they could do it like promised neverland, where they want for the manga to continue but then the manga becomes really bad
[2023-01-06 20:50:23] <+willyd333> I'd kinda like to see what those 2 guys from the prison game come up with as game masters lol I feel like they could come up with something pretty messed up
[2023-01-06 20:50:23] <%Caleb_IsHere> GoT didn't go downhill. They were doing fine then drove off a cliff.
[2023-01-06 20:50:26] <%$EsquireVT> i thoroughly enjoyed glass onion personally
[2023-01-06 20:50:33] <%$EsquireVT> was a nice spiritual sequel to Knives Out

[2023-01-06 20:52:27] <%AphoticAffinity> Knives out lost all sense of mystery once I learned about a early plot point (no spoilers)

[2023-01-06 20:54:49] <+xDarthPanda> little ceasars regular pizza isnt even bad
[2023-01-06 20:54:49] <%$EsquireVT> @GoNnaBeLaTe should there be a poll for "which pizza would make the best pillow?"

[2023-01-06 21:39:06] <%Calvinman4> well according to the abstract "The political basis of the religion of Islam can be considered both a centripetal and centrifugal force"
[2023-01-06 21:39:15] <%Calvinman4> so yes
[2023-01-06 21:39:16] <%looster412> centrifugal or centripetal though
