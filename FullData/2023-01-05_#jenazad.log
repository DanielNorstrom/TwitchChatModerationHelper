[2023-01-05 10:42:01] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2023-01-05 10:45:48] <TalesTyrone> SG's defense of innate 15% is so fucking cringe, they want the game to go pro but don't care that you're basically just fucked 15% of the time. No amount of gear farming or strategy can counter it.
[2023-01-05 10:45:51] <%Cloakin7> ratJAM
[2023-01-05 10:45:54] <Murakane> at the start of battle he should give the buff to all + add something

[2023-01-05 10:46:20] <tundranocaps> @TalesTyrone No, they protect 15% because otherwise people can be locked and never have a shot at even playing.
[2023-01-05 10:46:21] <%+bigoa_> He’s summer Iseria before Ran/Peira came out
[2023-01-05 10:46:24] <dazai1v9> but that doesn't make an excuse for a buff. unless he doesn't work in a slow comp

[2023-01-05 10:47:23] <TalesTyrone> @TalesTyrone @tundranocaps Isn't that the point of having debuffers AND cleansers?  @Yuruxo Sounds to me like BS - even if they just gave everybody 15% ER, at least there can be counterplay with a bit more effectiveness.

[2023-01-05 11:52:52] <%valkyr89> why does ray even need the focus thing i odnt understand....
[2023-01-05 11:52:56] <%Darkstilth1> SoCute The cutest of chats <3 SoCute
[2023-01-05 11:52:58] <Epy89> ML Ray will probably get a buff to get his S3 up faster, thing is thats still not gonna save him from immu buff LUL
[2023-01-05 11:53:09] <%termiest> DC soloed their team baseg
[2023-01-05 11:53:10] <%BartyBigBoi> mewmewSip doin ight ty for askin
[2023-01-05 11:53:11] <Sibirietis> yes every unit is a must pull
[2023-01-05 11:53:13] <IZackFury> so we pull him now ?
[2023-01-05 11:53:16] <jesus_christ_themessiah> the next buff is on march right??
[2023-01-05 11:53:17] <mjkim0419> how about using ML ray with sharun?
[2023-01-05 11:53:19] <killquota> why is he a focus unit? did they think his S3 is that oppressive?
[2023-01-05 11:53:42] <%satiricaljester1> would ray not be good with basar so there un buuffable
[2023-01-05 11:53:44] <%barald> preban Ed and Dilibet baseg
[2023-01-05 11:53:51] <%prinzsouls> sharun S1 is broken
[2023-01-05 11:53:54] <%+ulgo2> i think they might have gotten forgiveness with pflan and elena, but people might start getting mad, if it's just standard operative procedure to make garbage and then make it good
[2023-01-05 11:53:57] <Fyrowe> why is shuna a focus unit PunOko
[2023-01-05 11:53:57] <%kiritokazutoa> @CornwelI u get 3 star mob
[2023-01-05 11:54:00] <SomeSiiri> I still try to summon Ray. He hot peepoShy
[2023-01-05 11:54:00] <getdatgreen> because he wants to FOCUS on his research!!
[2023-01-05 11:54:01] <aughhuh> sg wants longer battles
[2023-01-05 11:54:10] <oopspeanut> I think it doesn't make sense to let him open with s3 first?
[2023-01-05 11:54:17] <+Graez_RotMG> but then he would be usable
[2023-01-05 11:54:18] <NubcakePie> They should have gave him strip if they want to keep it focus
[2023-01-05 11:54:20] <%+El3m3nT120> @jenazad dizzy build?
[2023-01-05 11:54:21] <oopspeanut> since then his S3 will have a long cool down?
[2023-01-05 11:54:23] <%Zetaphax> Anything with Extra attacks or counter attacks would apply too many venoms if you got it off right at the get go
[2023-01-05 11:54:26] <IZackFury> they only buff he will get maybe start with 3 focus ?
[2023-01-05 11:54:31] <reiyuu> 100 charm SHEEEESH OP NOWAY
[2023-01-05 11:54:34] <tlon21> NOWAY
[2023-01-05 11:54:39] <+d34thscyth34> lower buff duration, not strip
[2023-01-05 11:54:41] <+mafuyui> if it needs focus it should be strong KEKW
[2023-01-05 11:54:43] <%Puffypuffs> dont give them ideas KEKWait
[2023-01-05 11:54:45] <%reydedark> what if he changed all buffs to venom
[2023-01-05 11:54:47] <TouhouMirai> his base speed very low, not like he can take t1 ez
[2023-01-05 11:54:47] VIEWERS: 1 636
[2023-01-05 11:54:52] <ThirteenLantern> strips a buff turn it into venom ok
[2023-01-05 11:54:52] <%+Rhialk> Making Venon 1 turn, proc at the same turn he user gets it would do wonders to him
[2023-01-05 11:54:52] <%+screaming_noises> alright now we know whats gonna happen in 2 months
[2023-01-05 11:54:54] <InPassant> what if they did fighting spirit instead and it increased by the amount of venom debuffs on the enemy team kinda like landy
[2023-01-05 11:54:55] <EmptyHandedXIV> Make s3 none attack skill :)
[2023-01-05 11:54:56] <+HotShotQ8> or put random debuff
[2023-01-05 11:55:01] <%+laxiusvp> what if he gained focus if the opponent has venom?

[2023-01-05 11:55:19] <sveman1997> can you counter with him to make him s3 faster
[2023-01-05 11:55:24] <+Arkantana> his S1 should venom
[2023-01-05 11:55:29] <NoxNumbers> 8 turn cd ICANT
[2023-01-05 11:55:32] <AkaruiSenshi> his s1 detonates venom and stuns unit
[2023-01-05 11:55:36] <ThirteenLantern> give allies pestilence in turn 1 ?
[2023-01-05 11:55:50] <Leonfps50> smilegate when wants to make a weak unit they just make them need focus to S3, shuna would be a okay unit without the focus
[2023-01-05 11:55:50] <russteezz14> eda and belian gears
[2023-01-05 11:55:54] <%lumilavish> \]

[2023-01-05 12:09:15] <ChotoMatte> just make his s2 apply pestilence at the start of battle and maybe you can start detonating with s1 🤔
[2023-01-05 12:09:19] <oopspeanut> so when it hits his turn
[2023-01-05 12:09:20] <+Arkantana> Zahhak already murder whatever he S3 anyway
[2023-01-05 12:09:22] <Michaelwzv> Don't worry he will get buff soon KEKW
[2023-01-05 12:09:22] <TouhouMirai> you can finish 2 matches while waiting Ray to actually do his thing ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-05 12:09:29] <oopspeanut> he can s3 with more dmg on that person?
[2023-01-05 12:09:37] <%+izzrick> he's so bad that he's a must pull for futur buff
[2023-01-05 12:09:42] <%just_mel__> Waiting buffs
[2023-01-05 12:09:57] <dazai1v9> try him on counter please
[2023-01-05 12:09:58] <%Vincentx0> WTFF you already SSS him?
[2023-01-05 12:10:20] <cheezybaconburger> make venom uncleansable
[2023-01-05 12:10:20] <+finnthehuhman> @Vincentx0 he had 5 dupes of Ray
[2023-01-05 12:10:25] <NubcakePie> He needs other venomers/injury people and that makes him hyper inflexible and greedy
[2023-01-05 12:10:26] <%+ulgo2> when your allies have pestilence does it matter if they have effectiveness? if not that seems kinda whack as well
[2023-01-05 12:10:27] <%+Mcfriespls> KEKW typical ray
[2023-01-05 12:10:28] <NornofFate> @Jenazad Most of the matches where he could be good have me thinking "Wouldn't Dark Corvus just work better here?"
[2023-01-05 12:10:29] <OKB2> so must pull KEKW
[2023-01-05 12:10:34] <%15MinuteMidas> i think he's kinda hot
[2023-01-05 12:10:34] <%Vincentx0> @finnthehuhman oh. makes sense then
[2023-01-05 12:10:35] <gahaher1> you forgot to say he's hot
[2023-01-05 12:10:38] <aneixsus_sy> I disagree with everything u said
[2023-01-05 12:10:38] <+Luardzz> nah its pretty on point jena he just sucks
[2023-01-05 12:10:38] <Tig3rKnee> all i know is im going to get mad when they buff him shortly after his banner
[2023-01-05 12:10:38] <tolaz0> hes arunka tier
