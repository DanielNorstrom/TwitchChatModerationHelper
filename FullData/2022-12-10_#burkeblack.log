[2022-12-10 04:27:16] <+Striker2521> @BurkeBlack  one thing to consider for star cit is balancing the ammount of people who own the BIG ships like the hercs and gunships so its somewhat fair
[2022-12-10 04:27:18] <%+ThatsMrAnon2u> star citizen pod races

[2022-12-10 04:27:58] <+WarLyric> On the 15th developer will be giving interview
[2022-12-10 04:28:23] <+WarLyric> Probably announce the open beta at that point
[2022-12-10 04:28:23] <+Striker2521> cause with a war event id be worried about one side just having the advantage because they have a bunch of the Heavy hitting stuff
[2022-12-10 04:28:24] <%djuice_> Diablo 4 still has like 7 months of development.. dont really need to crunch
[2022-12-10 04:28:30] <%+Rhuvian> @BurkeBlack Since Discord is down, is there anything special that needs to be done to apply for the Eve Online corp, or just send in an application and mention my Twitch info?
[2022-12-10 04:28:38] <+WarLyric> Open beta means paid beta nowadays

[2022-12-10 04:30:12] <%qpan> this 3.18 patch is a big one with salvage and PES its going to be a mess
[2022-12-10 04:30:13] <+MeegsPlease> PvP in D4 will be an absolute nightmare at the start. In beta everyone stacked thorns and it was basically you just kill yourself in one skill or they did

[2022-12-10 04:39:53] <%djuice_> WIFI Mesh is better for coverage

[2022-12-10 04:39:58] <qrokodial> with your budget you could've gone the professional route and go with an ethernet router with multiple WiFi access points around your house

[2022-12-10 04:40:16] <%Lain_2779> so if 1 goes down, you still have wifi
[2022-12-10 04:40:19] <+WarLyric> I'm having a serious face palm right now
[2022-12-10 04:40:21] <+skeoch> you should not be running consumer grade gear... you should be investing in small business gear especially for your network.
[2022-12-10 04:40:23] <%djuice_> MESH your wifi routers to increase coverage.. so its has a much more stable and constant connection throughout the whole house/backyard etc
[2022-12-10 04:40:26] <bluezy0087> mesh is good for multiple devices
[2022-12-10 04:40:28] <%OldGamerJooky> it can mesh

[2022-12-10 04:46:53] <%+GreXXiGgiN> all that might be done is it configure the router save the settings and have you upload it to router.... assuming it supports that feature 😜
[2022-12-10 04:46:53] <%Miscreation78> that router is about $1200 in Australia

[2022-12-10 05:13:12] <Kranesh> I feel like Game Awards is the next E3 now.
[2022-12-10 05:13:14] <%+WastingSanity> The crazy kid at the end was a big security issue.
[2022-12-10 05:13:18] <%CodeLuffix> The announcer jokes were meh, but the games and content were great
[2022-12-10 05:13:18] <Skarvha> The woman in the pink dress was cringe but I'm pretty sure that was a lot of her script
[2022-12-10 05:13:19] <%Nobiont> lol

[2022-12-10 05:14:16] <%+realpoligeek> flute guy apparently invented an instrument for the Dune movie soundtrack
[2022-12-10 05:14:19] <%qpan> i really wanted a plagues tale to win
[2022-12-10 05:14:27] <+Skullcap8593> @BurkeBlack my only complaint of the awards is vampire survivors didn't get best indie, as its spawned a entire genre of new games
[2022-12-10 05:14:33] <$JigSAW0621> GoW should have won FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-10 05:14:35] <%+El3mentree> @qpan Should've won sound design no question
[2022-12-10 05:14:41] <%+highlanderbh85> i would have liked to see more switch games but overall a great show
[2022-12-10 05:14:44] <%+raginbehemoth> im glad elden ring won
[2022-12-10 05:14:50] <%+WastingSanity> I knew Elden Ring had the GOTY on lock down.
[2022-12-10 05:14:51] <+Tuttutt> Voice attack is great there are packs that are set up automatically
[2022-12-10 05:14:53] <Argumus> voice attack? it already has commands setup
[2022-12-10 05:14:59] <%lokenplays> I think voice attack has the commands pre made for you
[2022-12-10 05:15:00] <%+SteeleRain> ya voice attack has packs
[2022-12-10 05:15:11] <+Tuttutt> Those packs have the voice and macros set up
[2022-12-10 05:15:17] <%+WastingSanity> effort!
[2022-12-10 05:15:28] <%+c0ff33gaming> Lots of Star Trek voices

[2022-12-10 05:15:55] <Argumus> @BurkeBlack i have purchased several from them, they are great. the voice packs i bought covered NMS, Star cit, and Elite D
[2022-12-10 05:15:58] <AetherDeus> Its better for elite, but works decent enough on SC
[2022-12-10 05:16:02] <@%jstubbles> Ya I have Orion for Elite
[2022-12-10 05:16:11] <+Skullcap8593> I know the elite dangerous ones needed alot of programming
[2022-12-10 05:16:12] <@%+dawneylee> Burke is happy lol
[2022-12-10 05:16:17] <+rDotFunky> They get all kinds of famous folks to make the voice packs

[2022-12-10 05:18:45] <AetherDeus> So, there’s a crazy thing you can do too - you can assign multiple voices to different ship roles
[2022-12-10 05:18:48] <DrSparkle_> Water glitched. Unplayable.
[2022-12-10 05:18:58] <%SniperwolfHD> Get the french woman voice.

[2022-12-10 05:19:05] <%BigBeard> I loved the voice from the Kodiak in Mech Warrior Online Burke. If they had her that would be amazing.
[2022-12-10 05:19:21] <PanzerSoul> wait, is this the cat whisperer guy?
[2022-12-10 05:19:22] <+Scrapped> Delta
[2022-12-10 05:19:31] <FyreLocke> Try Delta!
[2022-12-10 05:19:32] <+PB4UGo2Bed> They work well in Citizen, but I found they were better integrated for Elite
[2022-12-10 05:19:41] <%+KingGebus> Andromeda?
[2022-12-10 05:19:43] <Klewless1> There is a "Tactical" one. I'd have to check the packs again

[2022-12-10 06:17:49] <%+akulan> wasn't there a movie like that/
[2022-12-10 06:18:00] <$Raddius> I think Fatman paved the way for more badass Santa movies.
[2022-12-10 06:18:10] <ToastFPS> its better than the other violent holiday films 10 fold. All those other ones are "what if santa was a murder" and shallow and cheesy. Violent night was actually really good

[2022-12-10 06:40:29] <+DocoRock> Could have said stuff about me.
[2022-12-10 06:40:30] <+PoorlyHung> you just know some idiot contacted Bill Clinton for comment LuL
[2022-12-10 06:40:30] <%MornielMoonlit> delivers a Gamer Manifesto, heh
[2022-12-10 06:40:39] <%Truthfoot> burkeRave burkeRave burkeRave burkeRave
[2022-12-10 06:40:39] <%+Cyberwolf74> something Like " I would like to thank my Rabbi Bill Clinton"
[2022-12-10 06:40:42] <%PKM4STER> you saw Milf Hunter got a steam deck? LUL
[2022-12-10 06:40:43] <%Lain_2779> invite only section in front, random people in the back
[2022-12-10 06:40:45] <britedog> ban them all
[2022-12-10 06:40:48] <%Lain_2779> easy fix
[2022-12-10 06:40:52] <britedog> lol
[2022-12-10 06:40:56] <%+Vraiya> prolly just a seat filler
[2022-12-10 06:40:58] <%gingytrucking> i seen that hogwarts won a award too burke :D
[2022-12-10 06:41:02] <%Meowzorzs> what was the message or thing he was trying to accomplish in the first place?
[2022-12-10 06:41:02] <+ThatGunsFoHire> Bill Clinton was modded into Elden Ring gassyFP
[2022-12-10 06:41:07] <MossyArrows> back ground checes i hope for next time
[2022-12-10 06:41:10] <Xzaven> yeah it was literally just a prank, wasnt all that serious. They sure need to check who got in there and how he got on stage
[2022-12-10 06:41:10] <%wildboy789789> it was boarderline tho... i mean rabbi, controlling the government, it did bother me, im trying not to be a cry baby about it but it was like eeeehh... what really bothers me are the actual racists in chat rooms praising his name
[2022-12-10 06:41:11] <%+Cyberwolf74> YOU Know Bill Clinton Blew up on twitter right?
[2022-12-10 06:41:13] <KhaoticDuck> @BurkeBlack  have flute guy work as stage security
[2022-12-10 06:41:16] <%PKM4STER> he was well dressed too tbf
[2022-12-10 06:41:23] <+jacobe218> @BurkeBlack I REALLY hope someone next year does something similar except instead says "wait, this isn't the way to the bathroom"
[2022-12-10 06:41:24] <%+Cyberwolf74> i bet Clinton was like wtf is going on?
[2022-12-10 06:41:24] <TDK718> I wouldn't be surprised that they start making it mandatory for everyone to wear lanyard passes like at TwitchCon
[2022-12-10 06:41:29] <%Lain_2779> problem will be the seat fillers, so they get good tv pictures
[2022-12-10 06:41:32] <H3ALTH_OCE> Yeah neither
[2022-12-10 06:41:37] <ChonkyCot> @KhaoticDuck only if he teams up with hurdy gurdy guy
[2022-12-10 06:41:40] <%wildboy789789> also flat out not cool to the japanese devs
[2022-12-10 06:41:45] <$inoooh> I noticed him and it was super weird, cause he came down from a completely different aisle lmao
[2022-12-10 06:41:47] <H3ALTH_OCE> Interacting with the team too by patting them on the back
[2022-12-10 06:41:48] <KhaoticDuck> @ChonkyCot  yes!!
[2022-12-10 06:41:50] <%+Cyberwolf74> @BurkeBlack He came in clapping from the opposite side and joined the line from the back
[2022-12-10 06:41:53] <Cerberuuttus> he looked like a part of team except looked way too young LUL
[2022-12-10 06:41:54] <H3ALTH_OCE> Really made everyone think he was part of the team
[2022-12-10 06:41:57] <Burnzs> I hate to say it, but hozier performance was terrible, and is he still relevant at all? I mean he did that church song, and had his 2 mins of fame
[2022-12-10 06:42:03] <britedog> background checks do nothing unless you have a record
[2022-12-10 06:42:08] <%+raginbehemoth> i saw him and just assumed he was one of the duded kids or something
[2022-12-10 06:42:09] <+Teeveesnacks69> even the team didn't know he wasn't part of the team
[2022-12-10 06:42:15] <Outershift> @BurkeBlack For me i think they need to make an example for that kid, cause this can cause a snowball where kids just hop on stages in award show. and it has discredited the game awards now where nominees are feeling not safe for next years show
[2022-12-10 06:42:25] <Kakuyoku7> @BurkeBlack that one lady was right..... there was a murder in the crowed... rip
[2022-12-10 06:42:26] <%PKM4STER> @Teeveesnacks69 this LUL

[2022-12-10 06:42:33] <$inoooh> Take me to Church
[2022-12-10 06:42:33] <TDK718> The kid came up from a separate aisle too, which is amazing that nobody thought that was kinda strange
[2022-12-10 06:42:36] <Moogles1> he was arrested shortly after
[2022-12-10 06:42:39] <justinh404> the flute guy was awesome

[2022-12-10 06:42:40] <crapnel_x> i think the "team" was just too polite because they were japanese
[2022-12-10 06:42:41] <%Lain_2779> pretty sure there is nothing to make example off Outershift
[2022-12-10 06:42:44] <Burnzs> That was the song performance after the longggggg speech
[2022-12-10 06:42:48] <%+CurlyRichard> Take me to church song I assume
[2022-12-10 06:42:50] <%+PAGANEIROS> I liked the Diablo 4 part
[2022-12-10 06:42:51] <7rip1e_0> i thought it was jeff`s son
[2022-12-10 06:42:56] <Cerberuuttus> @Outershift hardly need to do that as they learn to tighten the security
[2022-12-10 06:43:04] <%Lain_2779> they can ban from event, but thats it
[2022-12-10 06:43:11] <britedog> ugh same old puzzle
[2022-12-10 06:43:15] <%wildboy789789> it was really a garbage move, let me make a joke and get famouse, ruining an award for someone
[2022-12-10 06:43:16] <H3ALTH_OCE> Thank you Claire :)
[2022-12-10 06:43:18] <%+Cyberwolf74> he was arrested but as soon as they found out he was 15 they proabbly just gave him a court date and called his parents since hes a Minor
[2022-12-10 06:43:30] <Cerberuuttus> probably will ban him atleast for a while @Lain_2779
[2022-12-10 06:43:33] <Kakuyoku7> @BurkeBlack so here is the REAL question.... with all the bull crap that blizzard has been doing....are we still looking forward to diablo 4 and buying/supporting it?
[2022-12-10 06:43:33] <Outershift> as in harder punishment for the kid
[2022-12-10 06:43:34] <%Lain_2779> ban for sure
[2022-12-10 06:43:35] <bigballzz777> I mean how about those twitter drops from elon proving FBI colluded with Twitter to supress freedom of speech
[2022-12-10 06:43:36] <%+dex_xean> imo halsey song did not fit with d4 that was really weird
[2022-12-10 06:43:40] <TDK718> Oh yeah, that murder speech to promote the Knives Out sequel was so awkward
[2022-12-10 06:43:43] <%Lain_2779> but I cant imagine it will be a court or anything
[2022-12-10 06:43:48] <+ThatGunsFoHire> Oh my god I just seen a picture of them while the troll kid was talking and it says Crewmate, there is 1 imposter among us LUL
[2022-12-10 06:43:52] <%+Cyberwolf74> Imagine being His Parents and getting a Call from the Police..!
[2022-12-10 06:43:59] <$AllOfTheIsz> flute guy was the real hero of the night
[2022-12-10 06:43:59] <%wildboy789789> aside from that, AMAZING SHOW, im buying like 10 games

[2022-12-10 06:44:50] <+Wynterwynd91> I think the most genius part about it was how random it was. Nobody has thought about Bill Clinton in at least 5 years. That alone makes it memorable.
[2022-12-10 06:44:52] <britedog> ?
[2022-12-10 06:44:52] <justinh404> the flute guy was rocking the house

I would recommend going around that time, they have parades, people dress up in uniforms and drive authentic WW2 era vehicles around. I went up and down the beaches and paid my respects at the various graves, which were all in great condition.

[2022-12-10 07:13:10] <$Jasix> People can live react with emotes to your VODs
[2022-12-10 07:13:19] <$Jasix> and while live
[2022-12-10 07:13:31] <$Jasix> Not yet it seems
[2022-12-10 07:13:32] <%Malic_VR> it would be intresting if it moved at a known speed, to travel to one side, wait for it, and then know you have X time to search stuff before it shows up
[2022-12-10 07:14:00] <$Jasix> seen it on a few, seems it not on yours yet

[2022-12-10 07:14:24] <+kevkj> no we can't see it
[2022-12-10 07:14:30] <Lockehart> only streamers and mods can see it

[2022-12-10 07:14:45] <%Burnzs> Chat can't see when people are now, as it only is seen by us when we stream

[2022-12-10 07:16:13] <%+dex_xean> my ears really dislike that humming
[2022-12-10 07:16:20] <$Jasix> Yeah think atm the react just adds statistics to your VODs so you can see what sections people liked with emote reactions.

[2022-12-10 07:19:45] <KodaiRyu> Steam does nice, if sales are under 100k copies they don't they cut @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-10 07:19:47] <+Jodicus> no Steam only gives you less of a discount if you sell more than X amount of copies doesnt matter your size
[2022-12-10 07:19:49] <AlchemyNZ> I think they can take less untill a threshold is hit
[2022-12-10 07:19:53] <%+Nankam> Steam pays big publishers more favorably
[2022-12-10 07:19:56] <+TheDigitalAlchemist_> It depends on the the amount of sales
[2022-12-10 07:19:58] <KodaiRyu> take cut*
[2022-12-10 07:20:00] <@%^The_Kraken_Bot>* Burke streams Mon - Sat @ 10PM EST to 8AM EST. Sunday is Burkes shore leave. (All times and dates are subject to change)
[2022-12-10 07:20:01] <Joren456> steam dont care, which is how epic first got people to use their platform
[2022-12-10 07:20:06] <!%thetestgame> Same amount though from my understanding theres ways to get a larger percent of the sales after a title has been active X amount of time. Otherwise everyone is 30%
[2022-12-10 07:20:19] <Rabbit_xxxx> steam takes 30% of everything
[2022-12-10 07:20:22] <KodaiRyu> yah

[2022-12-10 07:21:06] <Joren456> rough idea with steam charts maybe?
[2022-12-10 07:21:08] <Rabbit_xxxx> a good estimate is 40x the number of reviews
[2022-12-10 07:21:12] <%wildboy789789> ubisoft just brought valhalla to steam... apparently the customer base is too good... im 110% a steam dude, steam knows whats its doing, its worth 30%
[2022-12-10 07:21:12] <!%thetestgame> Thats a guess but the true number is between Valve and the dev.
[2022-12-10 07:21:16] <+Jodicus> Epic is 15% and less if you use Unreal I think. Steam takes 30% unless you sell over a certain amount.
[2022-12-10 07:21:21] <%+WastingSanity> Steam charts @BurkeBlack probably
[2022-12-10 07:21:31] <Rabbit_xxxx> indie dev here btw, that's why I know these numbers :D
[2022-12-10 07:21:36] <+DocoRock> spider ,,, train. totally normal.
[2022-12-10 07:21:43] <%wildboy789789> steam would lower its cut if it was loseing any customers, its not
[2022-12-10 07:21:51] <KodaiRyu> about 100k already @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-10 07:22:01] <Rabbit_xxxx> 40 times
[2022-12-10 07:22:12] <stormrage58> 30% is excessive. But they are unchallenged so they charge what they like
[2022-12-10 07:22:19] <%+WastingSanity> https://steamcharts.com/app/1766740
[2022-12-10 07:22:19] <Rabbit_xxxx> exactly
[2022-12-10 07:22:20] <+kevkj> i guess they are saying 1in40 people leave a review
[2022-12-10 07:22:21] <+LavatoryLoad> You're using reviews as a "proxy" for sales?
[2022-12-10 07:22:24] <Rabbit_xxxx> approximately
[2022-12-10 07:22:28] <Karziel> # of players = # of reviews * 40

[2022-12-10 07:22:47] <+kevkj> i imagine the ratio is higher for indie games, because people feel more obligated to review it
[2022-12-10 07:22:52] <Pandasaurusreximus> !300k
[2022-12-10 07:22:56] <%wildboy789789> a measure like that would be less and less accurate with a smaller customer base
[2022-12-10 07:22:57] <FriendlyMitch> @BurkeBlack What are some major games you're looking forward to in 2023?
[2022-12-10 07:23:05] <$Jasix> that's a rough  estimate. Not everyone will review. I don't review every game I buy.
[2022-12-10 07:23:10] <TDK718> not everyone leaves a review :p
[2022-12-10 07:23:17] <Rabbit_xxxx> yeah there's a lot of variance in that, so it's not an exact thing, but that seems to be sort of the average is 40 sales per review on steam
[2022-12-10 07:23:20] <+Metazoxan> How does this island even have a population with a man eating spider train?

[2022-12-10 07:27:38] <!%thetestgame> @LavatoryLoad That link that was sent before it accurate. I can confirm that. 30% starting then you get more of your sales after milestones. Like $10M in sales its an 75%/25% split with 20% to valve. And it goes down more from there.

[2022-12-10 10:03:54] <%Elios000> eh clutch isnt needed really
[2022-12-10 10:03:54] <Craztwilight> It's been a very long time since I've played Racing Games... I wonder how the current gen games are holding up.
[2022-12-10 10:03:57] <+KlosterKatten> for 250 euro i would recommend the "other" brand more but i don't wanna make trouble for burke Kappa

[2022-12-10 11:30:30] <Asethe> @EntityofDesire Look at a few of the specialised Truck Simulator steering wheels.  They are a little more expensive, but a friend has been using one for more than a year with his EuroTruck sim and loves it.  Can't imagine it won't work well for Farm sim as well

[2022-12-10 11:30:41] <ElasmoFan> Imagine there's some good VR ones that you can use with this too
[2022-12-10 11:30:57] <Adie123uk> also when you tend to wobble back and forth when trying to drive in a straight line, you ned to alter the dead zone to help stop that

[2022-12-10 11:31:09] <+BryUnchained> absolutely

[2022-12-10 12:41:45] <%Dr_Vector> The minimum is what the station tries to maintain for the sector.  Provided the other sectors are above their own minimum.
[2022-12-10 12:41:53] <+Kedea> Remember they don’t eat every cycle if you send people the kitchen can adjust the food there will be people starving you need to time the transfer from 1 sector to another

[2022-12-10 12:44:05] <%Dr_Vector> It's good later.  Marduk is industry.  Conditus for food.  Although you can build anything.
[2022-12-10 12:44:08] <%Eskylious> I set Sector 2 for Industry and 3 for Agri, leaving 1 for space and then 6 for non workers
[2022-12-10 12:44:28] <%Dr_Vector> There are three memorials.
[2022-12-10 12:44:33] <+Kedea> Yes

[2022-12-10 12:44:57] <%Dr_Vector> You can build all three in every sector, but that'd be expensive.  Check under the building tabs.
[2022-12-10 12:45:06] <%Dr_Vector> Should be stability tab.

[2022-12-10 12:46:08] <%Dr_Vector> Marduk is an industry focused memorial when you research it more.

[2022-12-10 12:47:27] <%Eskylious> you get to determine what your sectors are
[2022-12-10 12:47:28] <%Dr_Vector> You will eventually, but you set that up, and so yes.
[2022-12-10 12:47:46] <Draucien> you can make sectors have bonuses with what you want cohhHmm check tutorial for specialization cohhHmm @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-10 12:47:46] <+Rydoes> I think you can set policies and stuff later
[2022-12-10 12:47:51] <+AnotherJunglist> you get bonuses from having enough of a certain thing
[2022-12-10 12:48:01] <+Kedea> Tech is important
[2022-12-10 12:48:15] <%Dr_Vector> Storage management is rough, it's a delicate balance.
[2022-12-10 12:48:19] <+AnotherJunglist> a sector filled with industry gets a industry bonus
[2022-12-10 12:48:31] <%Dr_Vector> It'll take the DLS center tech to unlock.
[2022-12-10 12:48:33] <%Dr_Vector> It's a key technology.

[2022-12-10 12:50:02] <+Dysonatore> i was fine until i got till the next sector

[2022-12-10 12:50:23] <+Dysonatore> hovered around 0-10% integrity until a strike which doomed me
[2022-12-10 12:50:23] <%+Upturnedplug> the thing that got me is workers and non workers
[2022-12-10 12:50:38] <%Eskylious> @Dysonatore it does, for this chapter its the "stayed too long" debuff which procs once after a set amount of time. so its only an extra -1 for the however long you wish to stay. It will proc again on the next chapter but it takes time again.

[2022-12-10 12:54:01] <hydoto> Set the 5 to 0
[2022-12-10 12:54:02] <%Dr_Vector> You need to set 2 to 0 and sector 1 to like 20.
[2022-12-10 12:54:05] <Athorious> That is the desired amount in this sector
[2022-12-10 12:54:05] <Ormur868> you need to lower the thingy to 0
[2022-12-10 12:54:10] <%+RogueMoo> set source to be lower than the stock of the item. then set dest to be hugher than is in the dest
[2022-12-10 12:54:13] <+Kedea> You need another storage where they can move the food to first
[2022-12-10 12:54:14] <Nifty255> Ok so Burke. Been playing myself and I can say with confidence the one thing you CAN'T specialize a sector in is storage. The reason is the game isn't intelligent about pushing overflow to other sectors. Your production can only pull from others.
[2022-12-10 12:54:16] <%jake_wu6410> @manateemafia hey there
[2022-12-10 12:54:19] <+ArcAngel_Shadowhand> its reached 5 in sector 2 so it wont move more

[2022-12-10 12:54:26] <%Dr_Vector> The station is set to keep 5 units minimum in sector 2 right now, and not care what is in sector 1.
[2022-12-10 12:54:33] <%Dr_Vector> Just max Sector one, really.

[2022-12-10 12:55:08] <%Dr_Vector> Ah, wait, keep those boxes ticked though.
[2022-12-10 12:55:19] <Nifty255> So you can make an alloys sector and pull all iron to it, but you can't push excess iron out of a dedicated docking sector.

[2022-12-10 12:56:22] <Nifty255> BUT you can tell ALL sectors to pull something, like food. So a dedicated food sector would produce, and all sectors could pull from it.

[2022-12-10 13:03:53] <%+RogueMoo> @BurkeBlack set source to be lower than the stock of the item. then set dest to be higher than is in the dest

[2022-12-10 13:06:09] <%Dr_Vector> Also it's harder to fix the ship at high levels of repair.
[2022-12-10 13:06:17] <LordHollyngton> It gets way worse

[2022-12-10 13:06:32] <%Dr_Vector> By design the higher the hull's rating the less effective the repairs become.  You get less repair / alloy.

[2022-12-10 13:06:41] <+ZeroSmokey> perhaps it's a more excessive outside pressure each time you jump..

[2022-12-10 13:07:32] <Adie123uk> maybe different damage in the location your at. i'd think jupiter would pull the craft apart with more pressure than sitting around earth for example
[2022-12-10 13:07:33] <+HoustonWebster> Just think of it as Food, station need to eat too
[2022-12-10 13:07:51] <%Dr_Vector> It's painful.  That's why I ramped up the industry sector to go far beyond the break down.
[2022-12-10 13:07:53] <5ph1nxs> the higher the hull integrity is the less alloy it needs currently it's taking 4/cycle
[2022-12-10 13:08:01] <XVI_16> the jump damaged the ship and now it's held together by duct tape Kappa
[2022-12-10 13:08:03] <+Zarall_Archangel> @BurkeBlack , you will need 2 smelters to maintain the ship.
[2022-12-10 13:08:18] <choc_taco> Held together with duct tape and bubbleyum
[2022-12-10 13:08:27] <%Eskylious> the idea is the Vohle engine and theS Self-Similar Space travel are incredibly taxing on the ship itself. Unfortunately your crew lacks the proper know how and access to proper materials to properly fix it. So youre stuck basically fixing what you can when you can and hoping it works long enough to get you there.

[2022-12-10 13:08:49] <5ph1nxs> and they def need to increase the amount of science you can get.
[2022-12-10 13:09:22] <5ph1nxs> @5ph1nxs idk but when my hull was really low it took 12 alloy/cycle
[2022-12-10 13:09:40] <%Dr_Vector> They built the tech to be hard to get so they could basically cap your progress in each chapter.  Part of the anti-grind progression.
[2022-12-10 13:09:43] <Adie123uk> can the ship be positioned away from planets/moons or has to be parked at them?
[2022-12-10 13:10:01] <%+Val_Tom> Ignoring hull repair ruined one guy's game. Didn't keep the mats allotted just for that.
[2022-12-10 13:10:16] <5ph1nxs> from what I understood about the repair efficiency the higher the integrity the more take it takes to locate the problems so decreasing the amount of alloy needed
[2022-12-10 13:10:27] <+Zarall_Archangel> Food production in first sector, industry in the second sector. That's how i maintain my ship without no problems so far @BurkeBlack .

[2022-12-10 13:11:41] <%Dr_Vector> @5ph1nxs You almost have it.  The dev logic is the more repaired the station the harder it is to find places to fix but they still use the same amount.  For reasons.  Check your EVAs the efficiency drops as your hull goes up.
[2022-12-10 13:11:44] <%Eskylious> @5ph1nxs the higher the integrity the lower your repair efficiency so less work is achieved with the same amount of mats.
