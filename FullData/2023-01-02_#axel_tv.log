[2023-01-02 00:02:01] <@%^Nightbot> @XJIE6OPE34IK  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-02 00:24:11] [Points] GamerNeelie redeemed offer a fight to a specific user  (3 333) [!fights]
[2023-01-02 00:24:11] <@%^Nightbot> @GamerNeelie  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-02 00:37:11] <@%^Nightbot> @0_0rui  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-02 01:21:33] <Warnoq> You think advertisers really know that its people afk? I doubt that
[2023-01-02 01:21:35] <@%727life> @DragonchildTV nah they want people to actively watch and be interactive
[2023-01-02 01:21:40] <majesticoose> that's like $7k per ad
[2023-01-02 01:21:43] <Mittenfinger> if advertisers are not happy twitch is not happy.

[2023-01-02 01:22:46] <happyknight29> i don't think anyone would actually sit and watch a streamer nonstop for 10 hours to get the legendary drop
[2023-01-02 01:22:49] <DragonchildTV> @727life well realistically everyone has a tab open at either 1% volume or tab muted in a stream that they don't care about but the streamer promised to be live for a long time LUL

[2023-01-02 01:57:11] <@%^Nightbot> @JahhhMorant  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-02 17:41:01] <AngreDoge> maybe
[2023-01-02 17:41:05] <%$xBashkingx> yes
[2023-01-02 17:41:06] <%Qweets> @Axel_tv I think they'll take out santa and put in an event to help people get their rep back
[2023-01-02 17:41:21] <%mart21_> slowly less and less people watching as the wipe goes on
[2023-01-02 17:41:27] <xekki__> if those three bosses are here rouges will be mad no matter what no?
[2023-01-02 17:41:32] <%mart21_> and then it evens out

[2023-01-02 17:42:12] <+arvichwolf> you have a sniper take them all out while youre at it
[2023-01-02 17:42:29] <%+S_mea_R> they don't like it when you touchy touchy the trucks, no touchy touchy
[2023-01-02 17:42:29] <voidkillzz> do you lose fence rep or something if you kill them?
[2023-01-02 17:42:30] <%+BigStuds> did you roll a bear this wipe?
[2023-01-02 17:42:36] <AngreDoge> take them out before they aimbot you
[2023-01-02 17:42:38] <bold0s> @voidkillzz nope
[2023-01-02 17:42:39] <+arvichwolf> the best way i found myself to go to the treatment plant is following the fence on the right (where you are at) and sniping them all at night
[2023-01-02 17:42:47] <+arvichwolf> the rogues at the front wont do anything though
[2023-01-02 17:42:49] <SlyJohn> why those motherfuckers have mined up the mountains now? I used to snipe rouges there two wipes ago :(
[2023-01-02 17:42:51] <+arvichwolf> unless you stay out of their sight

[2023-01-02 17:44:30] <+willisavage_> so if you go into lighthouse on your next raid naked and just throw a grenade at your feet does that reset the aggro?

[2023-01-02 19:33:39] <@%^Nightbot> @RainyDaiz_  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-02 20:51:38] <WeenieTTV> Not sure how I feel about lighthouse to be honest, the zoning seems all wrong, like a train station near a highway, near a mountainous resort and an upscale neighborhood. Near a village of wooden cottages. Doesn't feel like a real place, especially this close to Shoreline, with a health resort.
