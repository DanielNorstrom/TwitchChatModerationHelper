[2022-12-31 01:13:46] <%+Original_Munchkin> yea but TECHNICALLY Kapp
[2022-12-31 01:13:47] <xlely> golden ticket start is Pog
[2022-12-31 01:13:51] <%kayesel> xdd
[2022-12-31 01:13:52] <vermooth1> how much of tft is luck
[2022-12-31 01:13:57] <7Ack7> Smedge
[2022-12-31 01:13:57] <Mrush71> New to the game. What’s an easy comp to learn and play ?
[2022-12-31 01:14:10] <xlely> @Mrush71 yuumi
[2022-12-31 01:14:18] <bert2bert> Garbage set
[2022-12-31 01:14:19] <%Czeckers> so 20
[2022-12-31 01:14:19] <+GCHeroes> soju says the game is basically bingo KEKW
[2022-12-31 01:14:21] <LiveJY> jax or yummi whoever hits wins xdd
[2022-12-31 01:14:23] <seekermon> agreeGe
[2022-12-31 01:14:23] <%minichau24> double of 10 xdd
[2022-12-31 01:14:25] <JoeyNz2> wats 10x2>
[2022-12-31 01:14:27] <Turbi_neter> its like 20-30
[2022-12-31 01:14:27] <%+FilthyLootGoblin> so 45?
[2022-12-31 01:14:32] <EienSeiryuu> Reroll set is naturally gonna be higher luck
[2022-12-31 01:14:33] <%BaoTheNoodle> @emilyywang would it be more fair if you dont get free Rolls between rounds and only for refresh shop?
[2022-12-31 01:14:34] <Lumos77> Thats just the patch tho
[2022-12-31 01:14:35] <+Manaron> I'd think so but how can a certain RQ strimmer stay at 1700
[2022-12-31 01:14:37] <rebikhan> It’s a ton of RNG because the meta is reroll and so aggressive
[2022-12-31 01:14:40] <Mrush71> @xlely  Thanks I’ll try yuumi
[2022-12-31 01:14:45] <myles_a_way> the traits and ideas are good but holy please balance team
[2022-12-31 01:14:48] <+asla64> shitty gacha game
[2022-12-31 01:14:48] <xlely> this set is like 70% luck
[2022-12-31 01:14:50] <%tutenstein_the_mummy> That's the patch tho not the set.
[2022-12-31 01:14:59] <s1nkiing> Pure GAMBA
[2022-12-31 01:15:01] <%sordid_dog> So what changed?
[2022-12-31 01:15:02] <%testificatetft> its so strange for me to be the minority opinion on this
[2022-12-31 01:15:06] <babychoncc> i guess setsuko is really lucky then
[2022-12-31 01:15:07] <%Jmei13> roulette is a good example

[2022-12-31 01:15:25] <myles_a_way> Idk I feel like they could have done a mini patch cause the game doesnt feel healthy rn
[2022-12-31 01:15:27] VIEWERS: 3 143
[2022-12-31 01:15:30] <PapaSug> so basically tft is a scratch off ticket rn
[2022-12-31 01:15:31] <%kayesel> @jerita_ Wave
[2022-12-31 01:15:35] <bbigbobb> @sordid_dog hero augments, 4-2 5 cost for example
[2022-12-31 01:15:41] <xlely> @jerita_ Wave
[2022-12-31 01:15:41] <rebikhan> It’s the set though.  Hero augs encourage reroll.  It’s a low skill expression meta
[2022-12-31 01:15:49] <%SirGabbington> From dragons to this yaaay 🥹
[2022-12-31 01:15:54] <bert2bert> COPIUM it’s just the patch

[2022-12-31 01:16:11] <xlely> @sordid_dog supers giving early game units the power of late game units
[2022-12-31 01:16:15] <Or4nji> prismatics make me dizzy

[2022-12-31 01:16:37] <Lumos77> Is cleaver actually good? It looks awful
[2022-12-31 01:16:37] <+Braddyd1> Everyone rerolls so you take so much damage when you don’t hit that you can’t stabamlise
