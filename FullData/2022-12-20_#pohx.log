[2022-12-20 16:45:01] <+xero_kelvin> For me SSF feels more like the D2 experience I lived as a kid, so I enjoy it
[2022-12-20 16:45:02] <%SilverkissTwitch> I've been thinking of trying SSF again, mainly because of your streams lol
[2022-12-20 16:45:09] <+Mactatron> you have to enjoy the journy when playing :)

[2022-12-20 16:46:19] <NEWBBetter> Hi, I take a look at the !explode as u said, but I couldnt find the Skill FX name that you're currently using right now. Is it on the Shop? or It's just a regular explosion FX from a skill. Which one tho? I'm too new to this. Sorry.

[2022-12-20 16:48:21] <%+mrp1nk_live> @Pohx I think the real trick for Sanctum is to run low level content to get good relics. Steelemage made that point and I think he's right

[2022-12-20 16:48:49] <Illumina> I could be wrong
[2022-12-20 16:48:50] <Maszzz> 1 extra item slot for your character sounds good
[2022-12-20 16:48:50] <%SilverkissTwitch> I think you need ilvl 75 at least for relic drops but other than that yeah
[2022-12-20 16:48:54] <%rane93> it does

[2022-12-20 18:33:57] <strain121> @donavanshepard poe is huge at this point and wasn't super obvious at its start anyway. if someone has little exp in arpgs and wants to try the free one that's really good, they might need to be spoonfed at the start
[2022-12-20 18:34:15] <+Sval> just got awakened ele focus off the cemetery boss, nice

[2022-12-20 18:35:49] <@%donavanshepard> And pohx does more spoonfeeding than anyone else in PoE that I know of. Yet we still get people on here demanding to know everything and be told it rather than taking 5 minutes too look at a website or pob
[2022-12-20 18:35:53] <strain121> @silverkisstwitch I had to be handheld at the start, spent hours on the forums and on videos following cookie cutter builds to learn the game. 10years later I can make my own builds but I didn't start that way
[2022-12-20 18:35:54] <PewPewFingerGuns> That is bad logic.

[2022-12-20 18:37:50] <%+kelisium> To be fair long time followers of your build (like myself) eventually learn what they need on their own... when i first started using your guides 3 leagues ago i was a total noob. now i have 150+ div into the build this league MOSTLY thanks to just reading your content
[2022-12-20 18:37:51] <+BaguetteEtCheese> @darko0o07 what does it mean ?
[2022-12-20 18:37:58] <%+kelisium> so the information is out there people just need to take advantage of it
[2022-12-20 18:37:58] <bldout> how if i search gloves and the only mod i search is exposeure on hit...
[2022-12-20 18:38:08] <%SilverkissTwitch> @strain121 Maybe it's a semantics difference, because I don't consider "reading forums and watching videos" to wanting to be spoonfed info

[2022-12-20 18:39:22] <strain121> @silverkisstwitch yeah, maybe that's what it is. I mean that I had to go look up every aspect of what was going on in the game outside of "monster slap, hp go down"

I  played Pohx build last season and when I switched to the Aegis setup I lost the instant warcry due to different pathing on the passive tree, is that intended or did I overlook something/do something wrong?
[2022-12-20 18:44:20] <+sikiser670> @pohx how do you feel about using ritual?
[2022-12-20 18:44:22] <@%donavanshepard> RF is pretty good balanced skill
[2022-12-20 18:44:25] <+Funay> Thinking I might go RF again but that was a little weird

[2022-12-20 18:45:54] <+Johnny_Pump> turns out, those two things are positively correlated. If something is disproportionately strong it becomes popular

[2022-12-20 19:05:52] <julabi> hi is this build your fir new players
[2022-12-20 19:05:54] <chadwisethebrave> If I were going to use Molten with CWDT is it better to max out both to 20 or keep them lower level so molten pops off easier?
[2022-12-20 19:06:00] <+poedaytrader> general question, can Import my current character into POB to check my damage or do I have to build it from the ground up?
[2022-12-20 19:06:17] <convay121> the gloves don't have fracture and you say  dex essence, but dex fractures are super cheap. ssf i guess
[2022-12-20 19:06:30] <kab112> is there any website where i can get codes for maps? like to see if they have curses on them?
[2022-12-20 19:06:32] <%TheSkadooshOfDestiny> With the POB and his videos this build is extremely easy to level with, can't speak for maps yet
[2022-12-20 19:06:33] <+poedaytrader> perfect thank you my guy
[2022-12-20 19:06:35] <eaglefs> ill  buy unidentified elder helmet and scroll of wisdom give me conc eff and burning damage SeemsGood
[2022-12-20 19:06:53] <DarkKwiskas> I am interested to see how you'll manage your atlas trees when doing SSF based on your objectives at the time. I hope I will get the time to join here and see it -- Time is of the essence! (pun intended)
[2022-12-20 19:06:54] <convay121> my business :( lol
[2022-12-20 19:07:04] <DarkKwiskas> (for example, less fractures in SSF)
[2022-12-20 19:07:29] <@%+fmsttv> @julabi you want to keep your CWDT low so that it goes off sooner, as you level your CWDT the hit value when your action is taken continuously goes up, so a lvl 1 CWDT is like ex. 100 dmg taken, where a lvl 20 may be ex. 1000 dmg taken
[2022-12-20 19:07:31] <%johngio93> @Pohx i hope u dont get burnt out with all us noobs

[2022-12-20 19:47:46] <+nickythehusky> i tried looking on your website first but couldnt find an exact answer, what should my dps be looking like before attempting bosses like maven? sorry if this is a dumb question im an old returning player so this is all new to me and thanks so much for all your help

[2022-12-20 19:49:01] <legendeur> if you feel like your single target dmg is slow, then improving it before doing maven might be good YEP
[2022-12-20 19:49:05] <+spudas2k> So we want minion damage because of Spiritual Aid, i see now
[2022-12-20 19:49:11] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @nickythehusky It’s tricky to say. Do you have 6L helm?
[2022-12-20 19:49:13] <convay121> every craft should have "check Global 911" lol
[2022-12-20 19:49:14] <+spudas2k> wondered why we took that D:
[2022-12-20 19:49:17] <YeAhx69> @nickythehusky Also note maven is particularly harder with this build as she disables life regen.
[2022-12-20 19:49:39] <kzakzador> @RatsGettingFat no i wanst ive killed it multiple times on other builds it was a ignite degen i ccound tank the meteorite even but on the rolling lasers the ignite always apeared

[2022-12-20 20:51:41] <convay121> tjohn probably the helm ammy or sceptre no?
[2022-12-20 20:51:42] <adolebitque> The -50 phys does do a bunch, because a lot of trash hits will get completely nulled when you have very high % phys already, meaning that you don't take huge stacks of chip damage if you're surrounded by infinite trash mobs
[2022-12-20 20:51:48] <%Zerograviti> @pohx but doesn't the armor bonus goes away when we drop ailment immunity from Purity? because the armor bonus is only when you're not Ignited, and we're not immune to ignite, we just ignore it
