[2023-01-02 01:02:50] <Ybretsev> Japan has great internal media consumption so they don’t need to export things. Which is why K-pop and Korean shows/movies are more well known abroad.

[2023-01-02 18:55:32] <kolst> it's because new players get the hakkar card back and don't know what it is and don't notice so they don't switch it
[2023-01-02 18:55:33] <ziptopz> @tim_w5555 back in the day when ever someone killed Hakkar, it would change the cardback for people. so people who have it on might never changed card back xD

[2023-01-02 21:41:12] <SpudSmasher> they gonna change alchemist to 'your next concoction *this turn* costs 0' maybe
[2023-01-02 21:41:19] <ioreign1> It's the design concept of rogue that is the problem

[2023-01-02 21:41:40] <+reaperonetho> @SpudSmasher ye or 3 mana maybe
[2023-01-02 21:41:51] <%+brhams_101> don't limit him/her to just great
[2023-01-02 21:42:01] <Tooshy91> remove stealth from the location creatures and make them silenceable into 1/1 and EZ
[2023-01-02 21:42:02] <ace_of_clubshs> i like the fact that meati complains about the meta yet plays rougue that is the biggest problem
[2023-01-02 21:42:11] <SpudSmasher> @SpudSmasher ye that could be good
[2023-01-02 21:42:16] <%+pattumee_> is this deck worth to be crafted?
[2023-01-02 21:42:21] <+reaperonetho> rogue is not a problem, all others deck being garbage is the problem

[2023-01-02 21:42:54] <ace_of_clubshs> @reaperonetho rougue is by far a problem, both decks. you have to play aroud literraly all cards on the game
[2023-01-02 21:43:06] <blackmesyah> warrior need a giga buff,
[2023-01-02 21:43:09] <ioreign1> I think they should let rogue use DH quest
[2023-01-02 21:43:11] <isko_g01> Why is this deck better than the Crabatoa one?
[2023-01-02 21:43:14] <bodiesKO> @reaperonetho surely 3 mana 50 worth of stats on board isnt the problem. nice try
[2023-01-02 21:43:17] <@%MightyKingPin> just reverse the nerfs from warrior
[2023-01-02 21:43:28] <+reaperonetho> 2 months ago the deck was better than this and it wasn't a problem
[2023-01-02 21:43:44] <blaze35hs> yep
[2023-01-02 21:44:16] <ace_of_clubshs> for me the only class that i insta give up against is rougue
[2023-01-02 21:44:36] <blaze35hs> then u could play mirror now u cant
[2023-01-02 21:44:40] <+reaperonetho> at least u can interact with rogue, with dh u watch him do things
[2023-01-02 21:44:43] <ace_of_clubshs> i dont even lose my time playing a class that i cant play arround nothing

[2023-01-02 21:45:02] <ace_of_clubshs> @reaperonetho nh dh is by far less tilting
[2023-01-02 21:45:13] <+reaperonetho> @reaperonetho ye as i said the problem isn't rogue, others deck being garbage is the problem
[2023-01-02 21:45:22] <!%PervyOldGuy> @ace_of_clubshs this is the only interesting deck. hs would be completely unplayable without it

[2023-01-02 23:49:22] <+reaperonetho> @IcyMcSp1cy  the card is good but if u play Edwin and u draw the Crab ur Edwin is useless, i'm saying this because i played the list with the crab for like two months
[2023-01-02 23:49:51] <IcyMcSp1cy> @reaperonetho just don't draw it off edwin 4HEad

[2023-01-02 23:50:36] <IcyMcSp1cy> @nerazzurri_ If you're queuing into a ton of DH I agree with cutting crab

[2023-01-02 23:59:38] <sonofman1930> As a Jew I don't like Kanya
[2023-01-02 23:59:43] <Marxeyy> I think it's fine to like someone's previous works if you liked it before they turned bad
[2023-01-02 23:59:51] <@McBanterFace> i dont think you can complain if people think less of you for liking him though
