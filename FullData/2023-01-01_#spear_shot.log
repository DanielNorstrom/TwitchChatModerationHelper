[2023-01-01 16:15:20] <monkeyboy90411> Zed is a highly trained assassin and mastered every lethal technique and every weapon including his body. including the forbidden techniques and shadow magic, Zed stomps the competition. Yasuo has been trained with the blade sure but that's as far as his training goes. he realistically doesn't have any hand to hand combat except for the drunken brawls he no doubts gets into at times

[2023-01-01 16:55:22] <%UwUla__> @Koz_n_Effect yes, because: it still reduces 4% armor per hit (while lethality scales with level) and armor acts as a reverse exponential. Early armor matters more than late armor, and so does early armor reduction
