[2022-12-11 00:00:03] <@^Nightbot> I'm not going to be justifying my experimetns. It destroys the creative process. If you want a good deck go play something established. Sorry

[2022-12-11 00:02:00] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-11 00:02:14] <Gobydan> I mean the deck feels weaker without Dena in it...

[2022-12-11 00:12:23] <%+Xeath5> they dont need the quest reward
[2022-12-11 00:12:39] <%+Xeath5> you usually die turn 6 or 7 against this deck
[2022-12-11 00:12:42] <%+Xeath5> you dont even get to play it
[2022-12-11 00:12:43] <@%+nomadfarmer> They didn't say "not important"
[2022-12-11 00:12:55] <arayn1> This deck is really strong. NHG, when you have the chance you should try it!
[2022-12-11 00:13:01] <%+tmart2323> what is the combo at the end of DH quest anyways?
[2022-12-11 00:13:23] <+HelenaBertinelli> Can you justify why this is the best deck worth crafting? O:)
[2022-12-11 00:13:23] <@%+nomadfarmer> @tmart2323 DH doesn't care about finishing quest, it's just reduction from the first two phases is handy
[2022-12-11 00:13:31] <arayn1> @tmart2323 Spell damage into face damage
[2022-12-11 00:14:04] <azreal3356> almost as good as when i top decked that plea bargain, i'll miss you julio but at least i'm free
[2022-12-11 00:14:07] <%+tmart2323> haven't seen it in a while. probs more a legend thing

[2022-12-11 00:15:25] <%+markwhy> @nomadfarmer thanks
[2022-12-11 00:15:58] <murrturr> just do it
[2022-12-11 00:16:32] <+chuuwire> not sure if it shows i dont think so. maybe check side bar
[2022-12-11 00:16:50] <+hilaryisthedevil> hit the jace
[2022-12-11 00:16:54] <+Antonbrehbrahbruh> the miss lol

[2022-12-11 00:17:12] <willwait428> I fell off the plaguespreader train
[2022-12-11 00:17:30] <@%+nomadfarmer> They do run Jace in the Casie list. If you hit it, that's much better than hitting the quest reward, imo
[2022-12-11 00:17:30] <%randomer22> oh yeah they run the 2/2 as well

[2022-12-11 00:20:51] <herbsman101> what's the otk guys?
[2022-12-11 00:21:22] <%randomer22> the otk is a bunch of spell power and the new fel spell + fel barrages + jace

[2022-12-11 00:22:11] <%randomer22> we can't see what it hit but very likely we got Jace

[2022-12-11 00:24:00] <+thevicc_tor> do you think ramp druid was hit by the denathrius nerf or it just switches to astalor?
[2022-12-11 00:24:03] <forever_guy> the egg ends it here
[2022-12-11 00:24:21] <%randomer22> should our deck run astalor?
[2022-12-11 00:24:54] <SadLH> wait.. we are trying to win?
[2022-12-11 00:24:58] <RA1S1N> astalor is nuts my man
[2022-12-11 00:24:58] <%+agrorob> its not worth it to put a invencible in the deck ?
[2022-12-11 00:25:00] <+hilaryisthedevil> shadow wonder death is salivating rn
[2022-12-11 00:25:09] <SpoopyHS> Astalor is value, and isn’t this an attrition deck?
[2022-12-11 00:25:12] <umbron2> this deck has zero need for astalor
[2022-12-11 00:25:18] <%randomer22> opponent is demonstrating the art of the scam
[2022-12-11 00:25:22] <@%+nomadfarmer> I vote for astalor with voidtouched attendants to combo on the last turn.

[2022-12-11 00:25:48] <+Altin03> The astalor voidtouched combo is insane trust
[2022-12-11 00:25:55] <astroworldhs> @nohandsgamer , is blizzard always so dumb? They spend a year making Death Knight... just to nerf it's one good win condition in a random update. Im done playing the game, I'll just watch u stream occasionally

[2022-12-11 00:26:26] <umbron2> does math work that way
[2022-12-11 00:26:33] <umbron2> shit I need to go back to school
[2022-12-11 00:26:35] <Meeseeks_> the math checks out
[2022-12-11 00:26:43] <SpoopyHS> 300%? Show me your work
[2022-12-11 00:26:56] <+chuuwire> 350% the eggs add an extra 50%
[2022-12-11 00:26:58] <%randomer22> the math is a little sketchy but beating boon priest is actually worth 300% more wins
[2022-12-11 00:27:27] <%culleexus> @NoHandsGamer is there a replacement for basaleph? i only have the signature version Sadge
[2022-12-11 00:27:33] <astroworldhs> idk, just airing my thoughts on in frustration. saying things in twitch chat have no real meaning lol
[2022-12-11 00:27:40] <+chuuwire> @culleexus KEKW
[2022-12-11 00:28:48] <SadLH> oh boy...
[2022-12-11 00:28:54] <@%+nomadfarmer> I actually kinda like the border for signature cards, but wish they weren't completely grey. Washed out partway could be cool, but I'm not a fan of this
[2022-12-11 00:29:08] <%randomer22> HAOOO
[2022-12-11 00:29:25] <Tower_XVI> whoa, grizzled no-hands skin
[2022-12-11 00:29:30] <SpoopyHS> Is that death cock rogue?
[2022-12-11 00:29:35] <SpoopyHS> I mean coc
[2022-12-11 00:29:43] <forever_guy> egg me dude
[2022-12-11 00:29:45] <umbron2> my only frustration is that they put themself into this weird design space where a card like Brann can be busted for a full year without any change because it's a classic mainstay and being used in BGs too. so they nerf everything that interacts with it instead
[2022-12-11 00:30:09] <Forel10> @spoopyhs yea it's death cockroach
[2022-12-11 00:30:31] <@%+nomadfarmer> There was a tweet yesterday that they have their eye on brann rn now, and that this balance patch wasn't our usual balance patch... this was an extra one because of worlds
[2022-12-11 00:30:38] <forever_guy> has brann even been busted all year?
[2022-12-11 00:31:09] <@%+nomadfarmer> Brann needs to be scaled back to only like 1.5x battlecries
[2022-12-11 00:31:10] <+chuuwire> it's very unlikely for there not to be a best deck in card games regardless of balance tbh
[2022-12-11 00:31:26] <+chuuwire> just the nature of card games
[2022-12-11 00:31:37] <%+mebiohacker> we should get baron to standard as well
[2022-12-11 00:31:39] <forever_guy> just the nature of any PvP based activity
[2022-12-11 00:31:43] <SpoopyHS> This is literally the jungle book
[2022-12-11 00:31:45] <oyoyoy_> how does this deck win
[2022-12-11 00:31:47] <forever_guy> there will always be a strategy thats better
[2022-12-11 00:31:51] <%+mebiohacker> battlecries can be doubled, why not deathrattles?

[2022-12-11 00:32:59] <%+mebiohacker> @nerazzurri_ why
[2022-12-11 00:33:08] <rckon3r> concede priest POGGERS
[2022-12-11 00:33:11] <nerazzurri_> 4 mana is a lot
[2022-12-11 00:33:11] <SpoopyHS> Let’s if he can win when he brings out his coc package
[2022-12-11 00:33:16] <SadLH> what if they not concede???? DansGame

[2022-12-11 00:34:07] <%+mebiohacker> @nomadfarmer but with this expansion, i think they would
[2022-12-11 00:34:29] <umbron2> The answer to "how does this priest deck win" is always "either they concede out of boredom, or we do"
[2022-12-11 00:34:30] <%culleexus> @nerazzurri_ first of all hes 3 mana and hes not in standard
[2022-12-11 00:34:33] <%$newport5k> How is priest treating you?
[2022-12-11 00:34:44] <astroworldhs> @nohandsgamer , what does it take to be a NHG mod? do I have to get a degree in Mod Expert from Harvard?
[2022-12-11 00:34:51] <%culleexus> hes 4
[2022-12-11 00:34:56] <%culleexus> but not in standard

[2022-12-11 00:35:07] <+hilaryisthedevil> hey no hands, aside from it being bad and not our win con and us not running the right cards, why  dont we add the quest

[2022-12-11 01:06:04] <SadLH> ...back to 400% winrate.. Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:06:12] <+iambackhohoho> plagespreader needs to spread to two minions (or cards) to actually spread
[2022-12-11 01:06:21] <@%+nomadfarmer> Now all their minions are 4/4s
[2022-12-11 01:06:21] <TheMrDudeManSir> ICANT
[2022-12-11 01:06:28] <Sir_Hugh_Jaynus> ICANT
[2022-12-11 01:06:28] <SadLH> he didn't say quest he said wuest...
[2022-12-11 01:06:29] <phoeba_> i think quest was going to win this
[2022-12-11 01:06:29] <pro100chelovec> i have a quest ion
[2022-12-11 01:06:30] <SadLH> oh.. oh..
[2022-12-11 01:06:31] <%+ucdchris1> have you consider putting the demon hunter quest in to reduce the cost Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:06:38] <%+borindak> That's acceptable
[2022-12-11 01:06:41] <astroworldhs> ooo, i thought u actually had a reason
[2022-12-11 01:06:42] <Piaggio> i knew it

[2022-12-11 01:06:46] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-11 01:06:49] <+KSO_Queso> Get in my belly!
[2022-12-11 01:06:54] <%+markwhy> in a game rn and this deathknight has 70 fkin health
[2022-12-11 01:06:56] <d3xy_h> Okay but have you considered seek guidance
[2022-12-11 01:06:56] <crazy__penguin> sounds like something a priest player would do PepoG
[2022-12-11 01:06:57] <%randomer22> quest could have won that game, therefore we should include it Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:06:57] <SpoopyHS> So does that mean quest is good then?
[2022-12-11 01:07:00] <dominican87> no one can QUESTion that logic ;)
[2022-12-11 01:07:01] <%culleexus> passive aggressively not putting the quest in danHuh

[2022-12-11 01:07:21] <%+wowitssteven> we've got to run murloc holmes to steal the opponents quest LUL
[2022-12-11 01:07:21] <+Beldram> Quest seems good for this deck. Thoughts? Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:07:28] <%kaiserwroth> What happened to that guy who got banned for redeeming get in my belly at the YouTube intro Clueless
[2022-12-11 01:07:31] <%randomer22> Mi'da makes sense
[2022-12-11 01:07:35] <PieTra5> new 5 undead drop?
[2022-12-11 01:07:38] <%+ucdchris1> maybe infinite mida is the way to go?
[2022-12-11 01:07:42] <+iambackhohoho> that 5 mana 8/8 that shuffles the 10cost spell seems good Kappa Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:07:43] <xxvladtepesxx> mida is good along plaguespreader
[2022-12-11 01:07:46] <cutie_bunny15> ban meeeee

[2022-12-11 01:08:20] <arayn1> Ban Me Kappa!
[2022-12-11 01:08:25] <dominican87> ive seen death knight handle infinite mida against me, but i might also be just bad
[2022-12-11 01:08:25] <%+ucdchris1> the win con is ur opponent doesn't have fun
[2022-12-11 01:08:28] <%+markwhy> how do i beat 80hp deathknights
[2022-12-11 01:08:37] <mightyergoTV> if you can get invincible on board and get their buff train rolling, your board becomes super hard to deal with
[2022-12-11 01:08:43] <thomass_on> @culleexus lul u've opened my eyes
[2022-12-11 01:08:45] <%+markwhy> i am literally disgusted

[2022-12-11 01:09:03] <@%+nomadfarmer> whoa, I didn't know about right clicking on people.
[2022-12-11 01:09:07] <+Rechapos> quest priest is pretty strong imo
[2022-12-11 01:09:08] <+Beldram> how do I beat the meat
[2022-12-11 01:09:14] <%+Pollopollo23> The only way to beat dk is with quest Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:09:16] <arayn1> I mean there are going to be some match ups that are going to be favoured, trying to win those will mean you lose percentages against other decks
[2022-12-11 01:09:29] <%+markwhy> what outvalues deathknight
[2022-12-11 01:09:35] <%+markwhy> and can go the distance
[2022-12-11 01:09:37] <%+ucdchris1> have we found the big spell mage
[2022-12-11 01:09:42] <mightyergoTV> remember when watch post was a 2/4?
[2022-12-11 01:09:55] <%+wowitssteven> control warrior goes the distance for sure Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:09:56] <dominican87> does that amulet keep its mana increase?
[2022-12-11 01:09:58] <Piaggio> hey nohands i know a card that insta kills your opponent so you dont have to worry about them having 80hp Kappa
[2022-12-11 01:09:58] <Yatanis_Alex> What is this mage deck?
[2022-12-11 01:10:18] <%randomer22> surely they never coin barbara
[2022-12-11 01:10:18] <%+wowitssteven> big spell probably

[2022-12-11 01:11:44] <%+markwhy> what does whirlpool do is it just like twisting nether
[2022-12-11 01:11:45] <ichmagapfelkompott> is blackwater behemoth really needed in this deck?
[2022-12-11 01:11:46] <+Axel_Bordello28> can i have list? can't go in the link
[2022-12-11 01:11:52] <pro100chelovec> why plague dude doesn't show us what we are plagueing? @nohandsgamer
[2022-12-11 01:11:57] <+Beldram> having a win con is so 2018
[2022-12-11 01:11:58] <+cladoxjr> @markwhy it’s better
[2022-12-11 01:11:59] <@%+nomadfarmer> Ladder is different than a high stakes tournament game, anyway
[2022-12-11 01:12:09] <%+markwhy> @cladoxjr what does it do different

[2022-12-11 01:12:15] <pro100chelovec> i knew that!
[2022-12-11 01:12:19] <%culleexus> he can cut down on the roping all he wants. he will always be the most hated pro anyways LUL
[2022-12-11 01:12:21] <cutie_bunny15> all pro players rope. Roping actually increases your RNG per rope
[2022-12-11 01:12:22] <%purple_funk_> The roping lifestyle should go well with the sex cult ways, thoughts?
[2022-12-11 01:12:24] <+cladoxjr> @markwhy destroys every copy of the minions killed in hand and deck
[2022-12-11 01:12:30] <%+markwhy> @cladoxjr o
[2022-12-11 01:12:35] <+Axel_Bordello28> @nomadfarmer thanks

[2022-12-11 01:13:14] <%+markwhy> nvm
[2022-12-11 01:13:22] <radx1199> I guess opponent likes rope play, thoughts?
[2022-12-11 01:13:25] <%+Xeath5> @markwhy mida is a legendary you cant run 2
[2022-12-11 01:13:25] <arayn1> wasnt it beter to hit 2/2 into 3/4 so that you didnt lose your own 2/4?
[2022-12-11 01:13:27] <+cladoxjr> @markwhy no Mida leaves a spell behind so it lives
[2022-12-11 01:13:30] <PaladinIRL> The best part of nhg streams is 5 minutes in when he gets sick of chat questions and goes full troll
[2022-12-11 01:13:35] <+AdlerXI> someone needs to nerf druid asap
[2022-12-11 01:13:36] <DasUberNutz> why is he not roping on ladder, I thought it increases his win rate?
[2022-12-11 01:13:36] <+AdlerXI> fuck guff
[2022-12-11 01:13:42] <funny_goblin_real> Streamer if i want to run the 6/6 that gives me shadow spells, would my winrate suffer a little, or a lot
[2022-12-11 01:13:51] <齊天大聖爺 (heart_hstoner)> @AdlerXI if a alien felt very mad becasue lose many times from this game, what gonna happen to this company?
[2022-12-11 01:13:55] <cutie_bunny15> i really like Nozdormu. He was cool chap!
[2022-12-11 01:14:13] <%+borindak> it goes back to normal cost when you trade it into your deck though, doesn't it?
[2022-12-11 01:14:31] <mommymilkerconnoiseur> hey Luke
[2022-12-11 01:14:44] <mommymilkerconnoiseur> what did no nut november do to u man Sadge

[2022-12-11 01:18:08] <%+Xeath5> there is no quest in this deck
[2022-12-11 01:18:19] <TheMrDudeManSir> the quest is a lie
[2022-12-11 01:18:37] <Sir_Hugh_Jaynus> why are people obsessed with the quest lol
[2022-12-11 01:18:45] <kksha_> @NoHandsGamer have u tried spell combo priest ?
[2022-12-11 01:18:45] <cutie_bunny15> there is a quest in this decks. it is to beat your opponent
[2022-12-11 01:18:46] <patrikk808> the quest is making your opponent uninstall the game
[2022-12-11 01:18:57] <%+Xeath5> i think they are trolling no way they would put the quest into a plaguespreader deck... cant be that 3Head

[2022-12-11 01:23:45] <+therollingAK> It'd wild that people come in and expect (less than a week into an expansion) and expect dtreamers to just tell them the best deck(s) or complain about a meta. Keep experimenting fam we love to see it. You're often a meta-shaper anyway
[2022-12-11 01:24:11] <cutie_bunny15> what a strong turn

[2022-12-11 02:09:20] <rexmkh> Imo, some of the competitive budget decks for new players like aggro druid are not as powerful this expansion. Spitter was a good option, but it got nerfed
[2022-12-11 02:09:21] <@%+nomadfarmer> @Xeath5 Most of my hours watching are on mobile... I'm just now seeing some extra mod tools I've been missing out on for like 2 years
[2022-12-11 02:09:22] <dominican87> the tech is to auto concede to priest. ez
[2022-12-11 02:09:42] <bigbaguette_69> i think you can totally add quest to your deck
[2022-12-11 02:09:46] <%+Xeath5> ah k

[2022-12-11 02:09:57] <+Frchdakz> aggro pala better than druid
[2022-12-11 02:09:58] <xxvladtepesxx> prolly aggro druid or imp warlock
[2022-12-11 02:10:06] <dominican87> I was able to hit legend with aggro druid. a bit rough, but it got there

[2022-12-11 02:11:54] <rexmkh> Yeah, I have wanted to check out how spitter has evolved post nerf. I saw that some hunter mains were starting to use it in a midrange fashion.
[2022-12-11 02:11:57] <%+tft_spark> at this point hes just feeling himself
[2022-12-11 02:12:02] <nothwind12> How did Lich king made Beast Hunter great again?

[2022-12-11 02:13:13] <@^Nightbot> Hands have been doing really well lately. Started doing using new pain management strategies in June of 2019 and have been doing really well. Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-11 02:19:50] <@%+nomadfarmer> A couple dozen of us were making accounts with similar names and playing odd paladin to legend about a year and a half ago
[2022-12-11 02:19:56] <perturbedgertrub> @nomadfarmer ok ok. I was just annoying a bit :P Get to 11 start quickly :P
[2022-12-11 02:20:14] <@arti_bear> odd paladin got me my first legend iirc
[2022-12-11 02:20:24] <astroworldhs> I remember when you first added Egg into the 30 card deck. it's crazy how one card allowed for this crazy Meta Breaker

[2022-12-11 02:21:31] <Soru86> they can kill without

[2022-12-11 02:31:20] <Zaxlor> I think in the past 4-5 MONTHS I've seen maybe less than 1% of all opponents the streamers I watch, be Warriors Sadge Like litterally about 10~ games total. Class is a mess
[2022-12-11 02:31:44] <%+mebiohacker> warrior class was retired from the game, that's why we got DK.
[2022-12-11 02:32:03] <Zaxlor> @xcesme They got Sire nerfed, it was only a matter of time before they moved onto the next card Kappa It'll be Tickatus when Guff goes to 6

[2022-12-11 02:32:05] <rexmkh> why would you play control warrior when you can play triple blood dk at the moment?
[2022-12-11 02:32:22] <%RattlegoreLMBO> blood dk is just a better control warrior and blood dk kind of sucks. depressing to be a control player these days
[2022-12-11 02:32:30] <+AdlerXI> because noth of them are shit you can play both LUL

[2022-12-11 02:34:46] <rexmkh> blood dk seems to lack a strong finisher at the moment. Nerfed daddy d is kinda underwhelming at the moment.

[2022-12-11 02:35:10] <+Knives_Out> I meant the class in general
[2022-12-11 02:35:41] <prabh23> Eh I mean warrior hasn’t seen any play in half a year
[2022-12-11 02:35:54] <prabh23> Rogue and Druid are always played I’d think ur tired of them

[2022-12-11 02:36:09] <+Knives_Out> I’d be okay with Warrior buffs; enough time has passed
[2022-12-11 02:36:33] <prabh23> @rattlegorelmbo I just spent 7 hours theorycrafting decks
[2022-12-11 02:36:49] <prabh23> So I’m fairly frustrated too every deck feels bad
[2022-12-11 02:36:50] <khuchten> They buffed already but conveniently left out only mana discount card
[2022-12-11 02:37:00] <+Knives_Out> I also opened both Warrior legendaries that are collecting dust, and not the useful kind
[2022-12-11 02:37:01] <%RattlegoreLMBO> @prabh23 bonelord charge otk btw
[2022-12-11 02:37:07] <caybellHS> has anyone had any success with arcane otk mage?
[2022-12-11 02:37:11] <khuchten> just forget about that class if you wanna play control, blizzard clearly has no plan for it
[2022-12-11 02:37:29] <prabh23> @rattlegorelmbo I’ve been playing that list it’s fun when it pops off but can have some clunky hands
[2022-12-11 02:37:40] <rexmkh> @NoHandsGamer has anyone experimented with trying to make a kazakus blood dk? Although it sounds like a meme, it might help the archetype close out games.
[2022-12-11 02:38:01] <caybellHS> @rexmkh been trying a jailer DK since you can gain so much HP
[2022-12-11 02:38:24] <rexmkh> blood jailer sounds interesting

[2022-12-11 02:38:51] <prabh23> I cant believe some of the cards warrior gets, like that 4 mana draw one isn’t even arena playable
[2022-12-11 02:38:57] <caybellHS> i have yet to actually play the jailer so idk
[2022-12-11 02:39:02] <caybellHS> i either lose or win before then
[2022-12-11 02:39:03] <prabh23> Shaman got kinda shafted this expac too
[2022-12-11 02:39:04] <Zaxlor> How'd you ever draw Jailer though? You've got no Order in the Court/Moonlit Guidance

[2022-12-11 02:41:38] <%mstrike> Egg is a hack you put it in your deck and your win rate jumps to 92%
[2022-12-11 02:41:51] <steveomcd> DH was so broken on release Blizzard made DK as bad as warrior.
[2022-12-11 02:41:57] <soggettivita> astalor combo also needs anub in hand, going brann sire was super reliable otk

[2022-12-11 03:22:26] <@%+nomadfarmer> @NoHandsGamer Funny... opposite of the "we snap silence" earlier, I was thinking of holding the ruin last turn because I figured we could tank 8 from where we were and they're likely to make a ghost or two we want to hit with it
[2022-12-11 03:22:32] <lightfreeze_hs> had a game where i was blood dk, even if plague bringer ruined my hand i eventually won because i managed to put mograine in play and transform the mi'da before died once

[2022-12-11 04:15:10] <+Sammikk> I will say this deck is solid but running into 80% rogues when that's what u counter is tad lucky
[2022-12-11 04:15:12] <+Papaslim> @NoHandsGamer thoughts on nerubian vizer (discover spell, if undead died reduce cost by 2) over Scorpid?  or scorpid better to keep vizer out of Bonecaller rez pool?

[2022-12-11 04:19:58] <+parishbishop> why does your hero light up like that?
[2022-12-11 04:20:00] <+chuuwire> I knew killing denathrius would make priest strong

[2022-12-11 04:20:14] <%+Elderknightz> key to this deck is egg, game feels bad that you run it and lets you win.

[2022-12-11 04:26:30] <@%+nomadfarmer> @mystic__spiral your mileage may vary.... I know at my MMR I'm seeing a lot of druid
[2022-12-11 04:26:31] <astroworldhs> So considerate, giving and receiving Plagues
[2022-12-11 04:26:33] <+undlmor4711> its strong vs jailer paladin
[2022-12-11 04:26:38] <+Cadian_9th> @rattlegorelmbo tru, I gotta rogue up to legend this month so I can play casino mage
[2022-12-11 04:26:38] <unknlai> if you have bring astol in deck, it may be bad
[2022-12-11 04:26:48] <bruto_vg> Oh dh ofc
[2022-12-11 04:26:49] <mystic__spiral> thanks for looking out @nomadfarmer
[2022-12-11 04:26:53] <+chuuwire> im not big on watch posts in quest priest, but its working well in this scenario
[2022-12-11 04:26:53] <Yeahsper> @NoHandsGamer Up for a overexplain game next game even tho you are trying out stuff?
[2022-12-11 04:27:04] <phrygian99> Did they buff lightshower elemental?
[2022-12-11 04:27:08] <+Carthorn> @nohandsgamer you gotta plague speader their quest reward
[2022-12-11 04:27:21] <+parishbishop> he need to realize rigth away his win con will be transformed, and juyst play fatigue against you
[2022-12-11 04:27:32] <Miciomiciobaubau95> Which is the win condition against priest?
[2022-12-11 04:27:33] <mystic__spiral> so seems like rogue is still good to craft... all i need is shadow demise
[2022-12-11 04:27:42] <ToaTawlee> yeah please aim the plague spreader manually and hit the quest reward
[2022-12-11 04:27:50] <opheeliaa> xyrella Prayge
[2022-12-11 04:27:52] <thedesstroier> wait I was gone for one day from HS is this the mega now ?
[2022-12-11 04:27:56] <+parishbishop> @Miciomiciobaubau95 transform his win condition with plague
[2022-12-11 04:28:06] <@%+nomadfarmer> Did your plaguespreader just catch the plague?
[2022-12-11 04:28:11] <+parishbishop> summon big boards of DR late game
[2022-12-11 04:28:30] <+Cadian_9th> @thedesstroier At legend yes
[2022-12-11 04:28:30] <+Mr_M0jo> a lure without it's behemoth
[2022-12-11 04:28:43] <chromat1> is the high cultist really good in this deck, seems iffy to craft
[2022-12-11 04:29:06] <ToaTawlee> chromat1 19-2 btw

[2022-12-11 04:29:26] <%matmarex> @Miciomiciobaubau95 in an earlier game, we just kept resurrecting dudes until the other priest ran out of removal
[2022-12-11 04:29:42] <+parishbishop> @chromat1 its a value card. his 2 drops are undead DR that give copy of cards so its really good
[2022-12-11 04:29:45] <fry_junior> Hmm what’s the win condition? Sorry for the silly question I just got in
[2022-12-11 04:29:50] <+Aqibdabeast> you dont need to craft the same exact deck, just make sure you have egg in it and you'll be fine
[2022-12-11 04:29:58] <afroAlCo> set !bestdeck = egg priest
[2022-12-11 04:29:58] <ToaTawlee> @fry_junior opponent quits

[2022-12-11 04:30:30] <@%+nomadfarmer> @fry_junior Same thing as priest has always done... it's less of a win condition as much as a "don't lose condition" until the game is over. You can see in the upper right that it's working very well in Nohands' meta
[2022-12-11 04:30:33] <unknlai> @nomadfarmer I think it will, but I can really confirm it. bcs I cant see what I transform, but I know the VFX did appear when I transform a spreader to another spreader
[2022-12-11 04:30:43] <unknlai> *byt I cant
[2022-12-11 04:30:45] <Miciomiciobaubau95> He win only If he draw xyrella before quest completed?

[2022-12-11 04:34:10] <+parishbishop> best card in the game right now  Clean the Scene
[2022-12-11 04:34:12] <astroworldhs> Xyrella after quest is so important
[2022-12-11 04:34:15] <+Carthorn> what 7 mana cards do they have?
[2022-12-11 04:34:25] <+chuuwire> im wondering if the right play is to hold amulet and the light it burns for quest completion
[2022-12-11 04:34:26] <@%+nomadfarmer> I wonder if you plagued their 7 drop?
[2022-12-11 04:34:27] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> he really tries to get the plaguespreaders off the board before finishing the quest LUL
[2022-12-11 04:34:36] <+Sammikk> to beat druid you need to plaguespreader all their minions but kinda inconsistent
[2022-12-11 04:34:49] <+Carthorn> maybe their leviathan is a plague spreader now lol
[2022-12-11 04:34:58] <FardHast> no 5 drop yet?
[2022-12-11 04:34:58] <%Chambers_N> 90% is awesome!

[2022-12-11 04:35:03] <@%+nomadfarmer> @FardHast They only need a 7
[2022-12-11 04:35:04] <opheeliaa> leviathan?
[2022-12-11 04:35:14] <+parishbishop> he might be worried about Theotar and not finish his quest....

[2022-12-11 05:24:07] <+DonoHS> what if instead of the egg you run the new preist shadow spell 1 drop so it doesnt potentially mess up your amulet/bonecaller pool
[2022-12-11 05:24:29] <TentoMan> @NoHandsGamer scourge rager + animate dead + bonecaller feels rly good, thoughts?

[2022-12-11 05:33:51] <%+The_monster_hunter> not that many cards left tho
[2022-12-11 05:34:06] <VikingJackAU> shard is draw though 4Head
[2022-12-11 05:34:21] <dominican87> if we go to fatigue, idk if youre in a rush to draw
[2022-12-11 05:34:27] <VikingJackAU> er I mean silence
[2022-12-11 05:34:30] <TentoMan> I would get eggs only Sadge
[2022-12-11 05:34:37] <tictac_hs> Hey NoHands how are the eggs feeling ?
[2022-12-11 05:35:04] <dominican87> true
[2022-12-11 05:35:18] <tictac_hs> Yeah yeah I can totally see them being good, smart inclusion
[2022-12-11 05:35:18] <%+eyelikegae_6> what are "Ayeggs"?
[2022-12-11 05:35:34] <WitherMan888> i feel like DK is kinda week
[2022-12-11 05:35:36] <%Devilseye44> yes but what about quest? Kappa
[2022-12-11 05:35:40] <vayazu2> the eggs are just good cards
[2022-12-11 05:35:45] <+Verdyn_HS> Ayeggs are what the Fonz eats.
[2022-12-11 05:35:48] <dominican87> has he patchworked yet?
[2022-12-11 05:35:57] <+chrisxeni> @WitherMan888 i feel he is more like month
[2022-12-11 05:36:05] <+Sammikk> he's done two patches alr
[2022-12-11 05:36:07] <Fresh_dookie_209> ummmmm how does he have 50 health?
[2022-12-11 05:36:15] <+Sammikk> but he wasted his bran very early
[2022-12-11 05:36:16] <tictac_hs> Yeah LvGe made the first shell and then you changed some cards still doesn't take away credit from either of you :D
[2022-12-11 05:36:22] <dominican87> ah ok
[2022-12-11 05:36:59] <turn1concede> this is like quest priest without the quest
[2022-12-11 05:37:00] <tictac_hs> I liked Svalna but maybe it's not actually needed, cut behemoth cuz of switcheroo shenanigans but cutting switch might just be the call
[2022-12-11 05:37:04] <%Devilseye44> clearing the board brings more midas PepeLaugh
[2022-12-11 05:37:05] <Blastkool> Oh no not the mi'das
[2022-12-11 05:37:10] <VikingJackAU> As long as Mida doesn't get patchwerked looks like a easy matchup
[2022-12-11 05:37:15] <TentoMan> I just cant get rid of the feeling that the eggs devalue amulet and bonecaller idk, I have this bias for ravagers so I get it :D but its truly good for the early + cathedral
[2022-12-11 05:37:15] <vayazu2> are you playing this too tictac
[2022-12-11 05:37:46] <tictac_hs> @vayazu2 Yeah just played 50 games of it today LUL had like 60%

[2022-12-11 06:19:28] <+wagnercw> turn 8 btw
[2022-12-11 06:19:29] <Giannhs1998> Silly Nohands, you cant beat Guff
[2022-12-11 06:19:32] <IcyMcSp1cy> is a 3 card combo that deals 60+ damage balanced?
[2022-12-11 06:19:34] <!$dread_eye_> most of the time it wont begone
[2022-12-11 06:19:34] <+Roanoken> Love solitaire decks

[2022-12-11 06:20:13] <%jobraz27> at least they nerfed the hunter minion KEKW

[2022-12-11 06:20:25] <AllRise5566> did he dodge the second 8/8 from the plaguers?
[2022-12-11 06:20:26] <MrHandsomeNoodle> @dread_eye_ can it proc on minions that are already plaguespreaders?
[2022-12-11 06:20:35] <DiizcoHS> !bestdeck
[2022-12-11 06:20:35] <@^Nightbot> After 6 hours into the march of the lich king, I can confidently say the best deck in the game is Fire Rush Warrior. How do I know? Who are you to doubt my judgement?!?!?! Bow before your parade leader GOD!
[2022-12-11 06:20:45] <!$dread_eye_> @dread_eye_ yes
[2022-12-11 06:20:46] <+AlvasVisceron> I would have ended that message with "suck my ass" but you're probably less petty than I am XD
[2022-12-11 06:20:52] <%+The_monster_hunter> no one running a control deck will want to fight it so probably @Hellxjhonny
[2022-12-11 06:21:00] <!$dread_eye_> so its 6/64 all 3 get transformed

[2022-12-11 06:21:14] <+NoobsInc> @NoHandsGamer do you know why the 5 mana astalor doesn't give 10 armor with brann but the 8 mana one does 32 damage?
[2022-12-11 06:21:24] <MrHandsomeNoodle> @dread_eye_ oh okay i didnt think it could repeat on transformed ones so thought you just got lucky nothing ever got hit all game
[2022-12-11 06:21:46] <%+The_monster_hunter> @NoobsInc the 8 manas manathirst adds damage to the battlecry its not a separate ability trigger
[2022-12-11 06:21:50] <coyjabroni> @The_monster_hunter why does it do 32 then?
[2022-12-11 06:22:04] <%jobraz27> @NoobsInc because the manthirst text on the 5 mana one is something else completely, the 8 mana one complements the battlecry effect

[2022-12-11 06:23:15] <opheeliaa> rewording it to deal 8 dmg instead of additional 8 dmg will do it

[2022-12-11 06:23:21] <%+The_monster_hunter> Xyrella ruins it is if it hits brann or Anub its a gamble tho since you dont even know if either are in hand @MaGiiCaL_FuSiiOnZz

[2022-12-11 06:29:33] <%+Xeath5> @The_monster_hunter the fragment doesnt tricker when its silenced. but the hero cards replays effects of deathrattle minion that died. it is still a deathrattle minion even when silenced

[2022-12-11 07:19:12] <+Ojakai> marvel snap has eggs Kappa
[2022-12-11 07:19:33] <fahttytft> Snap is soooo well made. Extremely fun
[2022-12-11 07:19:34] <%+slighthaze> i snap into a slimjim on occasion Kappa

[2022-12-11 07:20:04] <finstas> how do u win vs quest dh?

[2022-12-11 07:20:35] <rexmkh> he was trying to get the other egg
[2022-12-11 07:21:08] <+skittlesme1980> how do I get the deck code
[2022-12-11 07:21:12] <finstas> gotcha, heading into the matchup now, thanks
[2022-12-11 07:21:30] <%+slighthaze> do you even egg priest SwiftRage
[2022-12-11 07:21:40] <@%+nomadfarmer> I mean, quest dh runs so few minions and they're looking to combo with them later... it's not that much of a highroll to hit Jace or spell damage minions
[2022-12-11 07:21:59] <%+The_monster_hunter> I don't find snap interesting for some reason, just seems too fast maybe.
[2022-12-11 07:22:27] <FlynnSP_> trade into plaguespreaders to create value
[2022-12-11 07:22:32] <rexmkh> this deck is interesting vs dk. I faced some variant of it with frost dk. I won, but I had to go all-out aggro against the priest. I killed him after his 2nd mida
[2022-12-11 07:22:45] <MikeCosimano> That's the same reason I haven't tried Snap. I'm a control player at heart
[2022-12-11 07:22:52] <fahttytft> Not sure if srs or trolling
[2022-12-11 07:22:54] <@%+nomadfarmer> So... you can easily play snap for 3 hours. There are also totally disruptive decks that feel like priest
[2022-12-11 07:23:04] <%+The_monster_hunter> Yeah slowish matchups with some randomness thrown in
[2022-12-11 07:23:04] <@%+nomadfarmer> You'll just get in like 100 games
[2022-12-11 07:23:05] <vayazu2> he means it
[2022-12-11 07:23:38] <khuchten> why do you say you should have played snap? the numbers seem completely mediocre to me, HS is better as content creater.
[2022-12-11 07:24:12] <%+The_monster_hunter> I also like the thematics of deck archetypes in HS, in snap the characters are completely different from one another rather than following some kind of theme.
[2022-12-11 07:24:23] <rexmkh> growing new skills is difficult, but having the willingness to experiment and deal with ambiguity is key
[2022-12-11 07:24:25] <@%+nomadfarmer> I didn't mean to go crazy on it, but I didn't play any hearthstone for like 6 weeks after snap global release
[2022-12-11 07:24:29] <khuchten> but you are not someone with 100 viewers

[2022-12-11 07:25:03] <+TheBerryMan0> always keep egg Kappa
[2022-12-11 07:25:18] <%steeeevvee> Is hollandaise viable on egg?

[2022-12-11 07:26:16] <@%+nomadfarmer> We did the thing where they don't get mida if they had it!
[2022-12-11 07:26:17] <+Seym0urButtss> fel dh has felt strong for me
[2022-12-11 07:26:40] <%+The_monster_hunter> Fel DH feels strong, just prone to some very bad hands
[2022-12-11 07:26:45] <rexmkh> a battle of eggs
[2022-12-11 07:27:05] <@%+nomadfarmer> I wonder if they got any mida fragments there
[2022-12-11 07:28:08] <solojazz_hs> Have you tried or seen any jambre rogues?
[2022-12-11 07:28:11] <rexmkh> I wonder if you could tech a warlock deck to beat this priest deck. You would include some of the discard stuff
[2022-12-11 07:28:31] <@%+nomadfarmer> Also, I wonder if we've hit their Behemoth with plaguespreaders... they played Mutanus early, so they probably can't complete quest without it
[2022-12-11 07:29:08] <%+The_monster_hunter> do they only run the 2 7s?
[2022-12-11 07:29:23] <chromat1> What about call to the grave to tutor Mida?
[2022-12-11 07:29:25] <@%+nomadfarmer> Normally, @The_monster_hunter . I dunno if the expansion gave any good options or ont
[2022-12-11 07:29:35] <Elijahhhgaming> Seen the new quest Dh?
[2022-12-11 07:29:48] <tictac_hs> can just xyrella then quest reward and play for fatigue right COPIUM
[2022-12-11 07:29:55] <tictac_hs> The*
[2022-12-11 07:30:14] <umjev> just plaguespreader the xyrella
[2022-12-11 07:30:15] <umjev> easy
[2022-12-11 07:30:27] <%+The_monster_hunter> with so much disruption lately you would think quest goes for a little more redundancy.
[2022-12-11 07:30:44] <@%+nomadfarmer> @tictac_hs If they can even complete quest... they've played Mutanus and lots of plagues have been spread
[2022-12-11 07:31:07] <%+The_monster_hunter> Mutanus was also just a misplay on his part since mida was dead already right?
[2022-12-11 07:31:21] <%+The_monster_hunter> Should've held it for quest
[2022-12-11 07:31:25] <tictac_hs> Not necessarily
[2022-12-11 07:31:37] <lucifer0034> Hola
[2022-12-11 07:31:46] <tictac_hs> They could be scared of theo typically and play for fatigue instead of going for the quest, but then I guess they shouldn't even play quest on 1
[2022-12-11 07:31:52] <tictac_hs> Guess they didn't know NoHands was ctrl
[2022-12-11 07:32:30] <Jerry_licious> wait they could get a mida by copying the spell, that's interesting
[2022-12-11 07:32:35] <rexmkh> the opponent's egg is leading a counteroffensive
[2022-12-11 07:32:59] <rexmkh> correction: the egg has backup
[2022-12-11 07:33:24] <arayn1> This matchup against the control quest version has been tough
[2022-12-11 07:34:35] <@%+nomadfarmer> Why not bump first for 4 health?

[2022-12-11 08:42:40] <+tantrum_knight> the pinned message is hilarious when you're literally 26-8 with this deck LMAO
[2022-12-11 08:42:54] <tictac_hs> We know he has a 2nd astalor and 2nd gigafin in hand
[2022-12-11 08:43:00] <astroworldhs> didn't he step the astelore

[2022-12-11 08:44:06] <Cuatakos> but whirpool would have killed astalor previously even the second 1 from his hand

[2022-12-11 08:45:06] <grimBleeper> @reczy__ Kappa tell new hearthstone players that if two divine shield minions are next to each other then they create an extra divine shield over the two of them
[2022-12-11 08:45:11] <tictac_hs> You can see it on your deck tracker just in case you forget the secret recast by tess

[2022-12-11 08:48:09] <@^Nightbot> (see bio) "People ask why my alias is nohandgamer. Unfortunately I started developing a chronic disability and have severely limited use of my hands. I can't use a keyboard and mouse without severe pain. Luckily, I discovered hands-free technology as a way to control my computer. I may have the slowest APM in the business. My disability doesn't hold me back in hearthstone, though it may create some amusing moments when I can't click fast enough."2020 update: !nohandsbetter
[2022-12-11 08:48:36] <Bemxuu> Regarding the pinned message: it's been a week since expansion launch. Are there really "established decks" by now?
[2022-12-11 08:48:50] <Anthony_Chenn> !nohandsbetter
[2022-12-11 08:48:50] <@^Nightbot> Hands have been doing really well lately. Started doing using new pain management strategies in June of 2019 and have been doing really well. Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.
[2022-12-11 08:49:03] <aendlessssssly> @nohandsgamer ok man serious question. I watched u before I went to sleep, and you are still streaming now, playing the very same deck. HOW? MonkaS
