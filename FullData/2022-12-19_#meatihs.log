[2022-12-19 00:10:32] <midliciouss> asmo i recommended control warrior to him like a week or two ago and he actually played it KEKW
[2022-12-19 00:10:33] <+xml22> Yes, I did brougth an idea, the streamer took: play a Big paladin
[2022-12-19 00:10:36] <+undlmor4711> nohandsgamer too
[2022-12-19 00:10:41] <Agyambagyam> Nope, I check what decks they are streaming, if it's not what I want I leave in 5 seconds KEKW
[2022-12-19 00:11:00] <unknlai> He will pick among hundred of suggestion
[2022-12-19 00:11:00] <huntstv> @MeatiHS depends on if you believe in the theory that with infinite universes every single possibility has at some point occurred at lease once
[2022-12-19 00:11:02] <paybrig> @agyambagyam Lol
[2022-12-19 00:11:05] <+xml22> He was doubtfull, played it once and then kept it for a while as it was fun and decent winrate
[2022-12-19 00:11:06] <frozen887> many times in many streams ... cus ppl can just suggest a meta deck
[2022-12-19 00:11:11] <ekmiikle1> kripp and reynad back in the day aswell

[2022-12-19 00:11:40] <danTheCookingGamer> @Dongerkingz danthe100Makessense
[2022-12-19 00:12:11] <Agyambagyam> There, it happened Kappa
[2022-12-19 00:12:15] <paybrig> How is it rogue is tier 1 every patch ?
[2022-12-19 00:12:16] <+Dongerkingz> Its just so boring to watch the rogue decks
[2022-12-19 00:12:34] <frozen887> control warrior is actually fun when the meta is so broken
[2022-12-19 00:12:36] <midliciouss> druid would have 20 armor + by turn 6 smh skill issue
[2022-12-19 00:12:47] <%+1nonlyshanobi> @MeatiHS on what class do you have the most wins
[2022-12-19 00:12:55] <nachowelas> why is kaza no longer a good card?
[2022-12-19 00:13:18] <MarkFromTheePark> @nachowelas too slow
[2022-12-19 00:13:20] <unknlai> its very fun to watch thief rogue when that deck just come out. but its not anymore now...
[2022-12-19 00:13:34] VIEWERS: 1 487
[2022-12-19 00:13:34] <unknlai> too much
[2022-12-19 00:13:41] <Agyambagyam> @nachowelas because druid and rogue and blood DK ( if it was good ) kill you about 30 thosuand turns before it comes alive
[2022-12-19 00:14:06] <nachowelas> fair enough
[2022-12-19 00:14:12] <achooh00> make warlock deck pls
[2022-12-19 00:14:23] <unknlai> also we have other finish card that dont need play 4 dragon first

[2022-12-19 00:15:36] <MarkFromTheePark> @unknlai astalor. even nerfed denathrius is better than kazakusan
[2022-12-19 00:15:44] <huntstv> so people were wrong about the druid astalor combo being 64 damage
[2022-12-19 00:15:46] <+Dongerkingz> LUL LUL
[2022-12-19 00:15:57] <huntstv> it's 96 damage, could be 128 if it wasn't for board space
[2022-12-19 00:16:05] <midliciouss> they dont look very alive to me
[2022-12-19 00:16:09] <+CandymanChriss> I performed a series of occult rituals, violating not only the laws of my country but also the laws of nature, spitting into the many faceted faces of pagan gods throughout an entire years' moonlit nights. The ritual was almost complete... All I needed to do was think of my wish.... and it would be done... my wish was simple- "I want Meati HS to play Control Warrior instead of something good KEKW" Didn't even have to ask him
[2022-12-19 00:16:09] <Agyambagyam> @huntstv yep, wrong, it deals 128 if minmaxed KappaPride
[2022-12-19 00:16:10] <mikroaze> !Warrior

[2022-12-19 00:16:18] <+cinnamonchair> wait they nerfed astalor?
[2022-12-19 00:16:24] <+reaperonetho> @huntstv 64 is the basic combo, it take 5 board space, but u can do more
[2022-12-19 00:16:26] <saddochi> no
[2022-12-19 00:16:30] <huntstv> @Agyambagyam but for that you need 8 board space :(
[2022-12-19 00:16:39] <unknlai> yeah. old sire, jailer, astalor. but maybe kazan could be good in pal and warrior ?  I dont know
[2022-12-19 00:16:52] <huntstv> also am I just dumb or can you not do the 64 with only 10 mana and no armor to start?

[2022-12-19 00:18:03] <Agyambagyam> @huntstv brann innervate anubrekhan astalor astalor astalor?
[2022-12-19 00:18:03] <huntstv> @reaperonetho yeah that's what I figured. Less of an issue with the 30 card deck since you have a good chance of finding your guff imo. But still overall the deck just gets torn apart by rogue which is like every other deck
[2022-12-19 00:18:33] <+reaperonetho> @huntstv  u mean miracle rogue?
[2022-12-19 00:18:44] <huntstv> @reaperonetho deathrattle rogue too
[2022-12-19 00:19:11] <+Petrozium> playing warrior, i'm always asking where are my good cards
[2022-12-19 00:19:14] <Banatak> Your good cards? They are in rogue and druid
[2022-12-19 00:19:26] <MarkFromTheePark> yeah this is pretty much a deck for masochists

[2022-12-19 00:19:43] <+reaperonetho> @huntstv  ye i think miracle and deathrattle rogue are the worst match up for druid, but i think it win vs every control match up
[2022-12-19 00:19:56] <scorepioni> as a masochist im in love w this deck
[2022-12-19 00:20:30] <huntstv> @reaperonetho yeah for sure. The priest deck that has that stupid deathrattle turn a minion in your hand into the 4/4 can be tricky though
[2022-12-19 00:20:47] <ricardovgai> i mean bcs of that you didnt draw you dredge card
[2022-12-19 00:20:56] <mambucax> nah quest DK ist best xD

[2022-12-19 00:22:06] <+reaperonetho> @huntstv  tbh i stopped play druid because of blood dk, he can randomly destroy ur win conditions, and if u don't have win condition u might still win but the game is boring af
[2022-12-19 00:22:56] <!+shanevapid> Imagine playing anything that isn’t quest dh rn
[2022-12-19 00:23:01] <unknlai> @huntstv pleagespreader not so good vs druid.
[2022-12-19 00:23:08] <huntstv> @reaperonetho yeah that matchup also feels like it just comes down to if you can dodge them eating one of your 3 combo pieces

[2022-12-19 00:58:03] <youngmoneygangsterqq> why is switcheroo so good i dont get it, just bc it draws?
[2022-12-19 00:58:05] <@Norwis_> i feel like they will nerf one of the Rogue archetypes And people Will just play other tier 1 Rogue deck(deathrattle,draka, thief, all are tier 1)
[2022-12-19 00:58:25] <@Norwis_> @youngmoneygangsterqq draw your Combo pieces
[2022-12-19 00:58:26] <+firemido> another deck drawer
[2022-12-19 00:58:28] <+BlitZZwar> I fucking hate this meta right now
[2022-12-19 00:58:28] <nikodragon> Hope the stream never ends these warrior games are too fun :D
[2022-12-19 00:58:28] <@%$Raptorheart> They should nerf From The Depths again
[2022-12-19 00:58:39] <+Alpr1010> Meta really boring
[2022-12-19 00:58:50] <@%Tinyfred> What sucks is how little we're playing the new cards
[2022-12-19 00:58:51] <piki_hs> i think thief gets 0 cards nerfed
[2022-12-19 00:58:55] <midliciouss> @norwis_ ye they will also try to push DK to T1 imo and next year we will get the actual balance changes
[2022-12-19 00:59:00] <+Alpr1010> I got legend with beast hunter, try to enjoy other decks for fun, and just end up switching back lol
[2022-12-19 00:59:06] <+Tsaion> well the rogues with ghosts just draw their whole deck by turn 7 and throw down 20/20 ghosts and 20/3 weapon.
[2022-12-19 00:59:06] <@%Tinyfred> So many T1 decks are like 95% cards from earlier expac
[2022-12-19 00:59:18] <@Norwis_> yeah exactly
[2022-12-19 00:59:24] <youngmoneygangsterqq> itd be hard to flat nerf all the rogue decks though wouldnt it, deathrattle/draka are way more toxic than theif imo
[2022-12-19 00:59:29] <Sherrybird> definitely
[2022-12-19 00:59:34] <scorepioni> Rogue is so done next patch LOL
[2022-12-19 00:59:40] <seeslash> i got leggend with frost dh. and hardly anyone plays it. felt so accomplished haha

[2022-12-19 00:59:49] <bogmonster2> i hope they dont buff stuff they always buff the wrong shit LUL

[2022-12-19 01:00:15] <kyonism> they shouldnt buff :(
[2022-12-19 01:00:27] <+Tsaion> if they just nerf the other classes they won't need to buff DK
[2022-12-19 01:00:36] <+Shadowmental> "buff" = change a few cards mana by 1
[2022-12-19 01:00:36] <@%Tinyfred> DK is actually really good in a board based meta
[2022-12-19 01:00:37] <+firemido> missing shaman gameplay
[2022-12-19 01:00:40] <!+shanevapid> remember when they buffed like 20 warrior and paladin cards and both were still unplayable KEKW
[2022-12-19 01:00:43] <@%Tinyfred> They shouldnt buff it
[2022-12-19 01:00:48] <LimunZ> @Norwis_ why would we allow theif to be the best rogue deck 3 expansions in a row?
[2022-12-19 01:00:52] <piki_hs> i am very curious to see what will they do but im expecting very big patch
[2022-12-19 01:01:11] <laytons_> I'm ok with them buffing DK, feels bad to have a new class and it having 0 impact

[2022-12-19 01:02:41] <piki_hs> @unknlai valid point
[2022-12-19 01:03:18] <@%Tinyfred> The biggest issue with this current meta is the same as it was 6 months ago, solitaire gameplay
[2022-12-19 01:03:36] <@%Tinyfred> The best decks dont even do anything on board until their win condition
[2022-12-19 01:03:57] <Manwello> Good thing they counteracted solitaire gameplay this expansion by printing cards like astalor Clueless

[2022-12-19 01:04:22] <unknlai> astalor .....
[2022-12-19 01:04:46] <+nonameswtf> i think they hit shaman too soon in nathria
[2022-12-19 01:04:48] <+firemido> he will do full combo next turn
[2022-12-19 01:04:49] <unknlai> you mean 64 in a turn
