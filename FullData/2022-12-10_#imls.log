[2022-12-10 14:42:31] <rachit> Doesn't apply all the time but usually, it's a curve I think, you can't enjoy a sport you know nothing about, start enjoying it more when you learn more and then gets boring after it gets repetitive @imls
[2022-12-10 14:42:32] <real_Iife_anime_girl> Do you think aram can be good practice for teamfighting in pro?

[2022-12-10 14:43:09] <rachit> the portal things in aram are interesting
[2022-12-10 14:43:10] <hid4ve> They should bring back twisted tree line
[2022-12-10 14:43:11] <%Randomguylul> and then ARAM champion damage is different from SR as well
[2022-12-10 14:43:18] <Fiora420> @real_Iife_anime_girl also the balance in aram is different so champions aren't the same as summoners rift
