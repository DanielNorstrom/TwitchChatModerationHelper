[2023-01-09 14:37:17] <TheLogicFan> Having a camera man could be great.
[2023-01-09 14:37:18] <!%+Arakki> you could hide a small shotgun left of the knife block
[2023-01-09 14:37:31] <+Booranda> rly nice with a Gas stove. rare in sweden.

[2023-01-09 14:37:54] <@%+DerangedM8> i think next time you could have your main cam closer up as a wider angle shot, and have the second cam more focussed on the cooking maybe
[2023-01-09 14:37:59] <Vosy1984> you saw the camera in and out flicker?

[2023-01-09 14:39:24] <TheLogicFan> Every process should have a least one closeup. :)
[2023-01-09 14:39:24] <!%+Arakki> yes you want the tripod to fall, not cable to rip off
[2023-01-09 14:39:43] <!%+Arakki> yea
[2023-01-09 14:39:56] <Homard01> he thought out the camera defenses

[2023-01-09 15:04:43] <+klone_iron_fist> the best steaks are just salt and pepper on a grill. If the meat is great, and it's cooked to your liking, you're good.
[2023-01-09 15:04:48] <Vosy1984> butter - fat, fat - floats on water

[2023-01-09 15:04:54] <%pdiddly63> you add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up if you need it to thicken

[2023-01-09 15:16:52] <ImaginaryBestFriend> I love my cast iro.
[2023-01-09 15:16:54] <GreenProton> cast iron is actually amazing. the heat transfer is way better
[2023-01-09 15:17:00] <malrockk> non stick is bad for browning foods
[2023-01-09 15:17:20] <Vosy1984> works for chicken
[2023-01-09 15:17:26] <Jellooze> You generally dont want to heat up non stick to the same high temp as castiron or steel pans
[2023-01-09 15:17:32] <ImaginaryBestFriend> you need a good amount of high smoke oil to get decent browning imo in non stick
[2023-01-09 15:17:37] <ClarenceStar> caveman
[2023-01-09 15:17:42] <ImaginaryBestFriend> like avo or grapeseed

[2023-01-09 15:18:23] <Jellooze> Maillard reaction hits at around 150-170C
[2023-01-09 15:18:34] <Jellooze> aka browning
[2023-01-09 15:18:34] <tuftyfella> generally over 230c(?) can damage the coating

[2023-01-09 15:29:55] <Jellooze> most of that oil is still in the pan after you've cooked with it
[2023-01-09 15:29:59] <Kelvarion_> Depends on what kind and how much
[2023-01-09 15:30:03] <Sukudo> as long as its not olive oil for fried rice

[2023-01-09 16:03:06] <hr77> mis en plas means preparations before cooking, all cutting etc
[2023-01-09 16:03:16] <Jellooze> @nugiyen  Mise en place is how you organize all your stuff while cookingh
[2023-01-09 16:03:29] <%pdiddly63> meh you can do it for home cooking
[2023-01-09 16:03:34] <Coolra1n> @Arakki you write it 'mise en place'
[2023-01-09 16:03:40] <hr77> the key to success!
[2023-01-09 16:03:43] <%+FraGDenShizOo> its a standert for every chef
[2023-01-09 16:03:51] <%pdiddly63> you lay it all out in order of yoru steps etc so that actual cooking is super chill
[2023-01-09 16:04:00] <anarchygoat> It 100% is a good idea, especially for streamed content.
[2023-01-09 16:04:04] <%pdiddly63> its how food shows plan their episodes
[2023-01-09 16:04:18] <%+FraGDenShizOo> one of first thing you get told in the kitchen

[2023-01-09 16:04:29] <Jellooze> its like having a organized stash in poe or when you plan up for a huge 100 map project. It works a 100 times better than when you just wing shit

[2023-01-09 16:06:08] <malrockk> I tend to do it part way.  Knowing what to do ahead and what I have time to do while another part is cooking
[2023-01-09 16:06:12] <Vosy1984> on the cooking utensils, I am using woode spoons and spatula, just don't leave them boil in the pot LUL

[2023-01-09 16:06:42] <anarchygoat> @Vosy1984 Better than leaving plastic utensils to boil
[2023-01-09 16:06:42] <ZeroHP01> you can't improve  things you never handled
[2023-01-09 16:06:54] <Sukudo> you can cut all your ingredients before though
[2023-01-09 16:06:56] <%+FraGDenShizOo> its a german kitchen slang

[2023-01-09 16:07:30] <anarchygoat> But wood is such a good flavour Kappa
[2023-01-09 16:07:52] <anarchygoat> Also... I wouldnt trust every manufacturer with plastic utensils...
[2023-01-09 16:08:00] <Parkask> Errors are experience imo
[2023-01-09 16:08:03] <anarchygoat> I've fucked multiple up, but mostly from being a moron and leaving them on the edge of the pan
[2023-01-09 16:08:04] <%pdiddly63> so something you're talking about, that you learned fomr this cook, is order of operations for meat prep
[2023-01-09 16:08:04] <Parkask> Mistakes*
[2023-01-09 16:08:10] <%pdiddly63> you now have that experience
[2023-01-09 16:08:18] <%MrBonkeyDollax> That's why when I'm cooking something new I prep all the ingredients before I start cooking, no running around cause I don't have something ready

[2023-01-09 16:09:51] <critzwins> cooking is all about learning and understanding the basics. once u have experience with basic cooking the learning curve gets easier. u learn timings etc
[2023-01-09 16:09:58] <%pdiddly63> yeah maybe its my privilege talking here
[2023-01-09 16:10:01] <+klone_iron_fist> watching my wife try and cook is like watching "worst cooks in america"
[2023-01-09 16:10:09] <Coolra1n> if i can give an advice for saving cleaning time is to invest in a splatter screen when you cook your meat like you did yesterday
[2023-01-09 16:10:17] <%herxtheslayer> @klone_iron_fist haha, another thingy easily replaced with cast iron pan LOLW
[2023-01-09 16:10:33] <+klone_iron_fist> splatter screens are amazing
[2023-01-09 16:10:44] <Vosy1984> it's fine either way as long as you use an apron
[2023-01-09 16:10:45] <Jellooze> @pdiddly63 i think your right, its just a difficult concept to convey

[2023-01-09 16:11:10] <TiiaAurora> One thing to keep in mind when following recipes online is that many sites now use AI to create content and the cooking niche is super competitive.

[2023-01-09 16:12:00] <@%+DerangedM8> a splatter screen though KEKW
[2023-01-09 16:12:08] <Jellooze> That is kinda part of Mise en place, is to prepare for those what ifs. If you think about them before you cook you will deal with them in a better way once it happens when you cook
[2023-01-09 16:12:13] <%pdiddly63> thats why there are steps and ordering to kitchen progress
[2023-01-09 16:12:20] <%pdiddly63> first you learn fryer, then char grill

[2023-01-09 16:14:47] <%pdiddly63> so for a weekend menu at this local place i used to chef for, i would legit make the menu, then gather ingredients and prep everything for say 500 meals that i would serve over the weekend, and lay it out with the flow of the recipe and the steps i would have to walk in mind LUL

[2023-01-09 16:15:40] <critzwins> if you cook every day simple stuff like rice, pasta, steak and fish, it will it be easier to follow more complex recipes. cant skip steps in cooking
[2023-01-09 16:16:39] <%pdiddly63> fat, protein and acid
[2023-01-09 16:16:43] <Jellooze> one thing i find to make recipes easier to remember is to think of the ingredients in ratios instead of measurements.
[2023-01-09 16:16:47] <+klone_iron_fist> my wife will be doing a recipe and decide she's able to skip steps or sub something without having any cooking knowledge and it results in disaster. It's fun to watch.

[2023-01-09 16:18:02] <anarchygoat> Not only thinking of ratios, but you should figure out what every ingredient does for the recipe. It will broaden your understanding really quick.
