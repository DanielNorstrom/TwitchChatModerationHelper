[2023-01-09 07:22:33] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/
