[2022-12-07 13:13:08] <MoistHeinous> LUL
[2022-12-07 13:13:19] <kiwiqzzz> Elden ring is definitely more innovative and over all greater as a whole the art direction is completely new and different from the past souls/borne games the story while not as great as past games is still amazing and the difficulty, grind and walkthrough of the game is always presenting new things, enemies, areas, and bosses, and not too mention build making has never been more diverse before so id definitely say this game wins over gow ragnarok
[2022-12-07 13:13:23] <+Solaris4> a PvE Colossem mode would be fun to. 3-man clearing waves of enemies

[2022-12-07 13:47:55] <D_DR> I heard there is a bug that after you crouch attack with thrust sword at left-hand your right-hand weapon crouch attack will use the thrust sword's motion too
[2022-12-07 13:48:09] <oneaficionado> @dani239 that‚Äôs actually a great idea!!!
[2022-12-07 13:48:18] <WakeX> there's a crouch poke bug now you can cp with giant crusher if you got a thrusting sword in offhand

[2022-12-07 13:48:32] <Pegolini> yeah the crouch poke bug is stupid

[2022-12-07 15:46:07] <%$Leonardo_07> Exactly.
[2022-12-07 15:46:07] <%+Illuna_Meira> is there an indicator when you are downscaled? peeve should check every match, maybe you are all matching based on the lowest level in team
[2022-12-07 15:46:13] <gr8sif> could it be that overleveled phantoms still have OP statuses?
[2022-12-07 15:46:17] <gr8sif> man I hope not

[2022-12-07 15:46:41] <Gorndt> @PyroBebop Quality is generally bad

[2022-12-07 15:46:53] <gr8sif> because invasions are the same, you can't seem to hit hard a overleveled phantom
[2022-12-07 15:46:59] <Lordpen85> commanders hallberd or dragon halberd are okay for a quality build. But STR is better
[2022-12-07 15:46:59] <sewerperson22> @P00se2 yep their deadly sin build is still meta
[2022-12-07 15:47:00] <P00se2> facts 4Head

[2022-12-07 15:48:17] <psychicsweat> elaBased but at least u look cooler doing it in this game
[2022-12-07 15:48:17] <+vassillios16> i don't like how it's hard to tell if you won or not
[2022-12-07 15:48:17] <Gorndt> I feel like the only thing they need to do to make ER PVP way better is make it so people don't die as fast
[2022-12-07 15:48:19] <sewerperson22> @Etherealizer i tried uchigatana bloodflame blade and sword dance it was good but in lower level duels didnt try it in high levels
[2022-12-07 15:48:21] <gr8sif> iframes on backstep RIP
[2022-12-07 15:48:36] <+vassillios16> they need some sort of after match grid or something
[2022-12-07 15:48:39] <Chata4Life> how to enter to the pvp?
[2022-12-07 15:48:41] <truly_mistaken> So u two could possibly go against each other While queuing?
[2022-12-07 15:48:44] <+ryanthewise_> Dark souls 2 everything you do feels so deliberate, ER is just a spam fest
[2022-12-07 15:48:47] <truly_mistaken> Or how does it work

[2022-12-07 15:54:01] <@%$ArchP_> we just took turns beating up the remaining opponent

[2022-12-07 15:55:56] <oponomo2> @zeik124 i think its 1 flask per person and it refresh after a kill

[2022-12-07 16:52:23] <+RexDeorum_> The arena music goes kinda hard

[2022-12-07 16:53:05] <+DynamisPreston> do the stats get normalized in the arena? or is the matchmaking level based?
[2022-12-07 16:53:23] <FloHost> how does scaling work in this mode? chat? like if my friend has a lvl 200 and i have a lvl 125 can we play together
[2022-12-07 16:53:32] <+RexDeorum_> @DynamisPreston Matchmaking works like normal, damage seems to be much lower than PvE

[2022-12-07 16:57:06] <Henpemaz> I'm on a laggy-ish connection and the fact that stat buildups still work on "ghost hits" when someone rolls is pretty good even against light-rollers
[2022-12-07 16:57:11] <vaselinemachine> Or 1.07 roll?
[2022-12-07 16:57:13] <Wamoo57> I think your gravity Knight would do well in a 2v2

[2022-12-07 17:05:50] <%+Groundwalkr> SS needed a buff if anything
[2022-12-07 17:06:03] <BravillanLive> true

[2022-12-07 17:06:27] <ezekiel_grim> like pvp fights would be shorter at 125 right?

[2022-12-07 17:07:37] <+marvinleonbutlerii> @illuna_meira i find this to be incredibly wrong, lower level pvp is a bunch of unoptimized builds, and then a few people like oro running highly specialized setups that kill you in 1-2 hits

[2022-12-07 17:08:23] <%+Illuna_Meira> @marvinleonbutlerii if you go against another optimized person, you will find it that fights are actually taking longer and its not 1-2 shots at all compared to this level you are currently seeing
[2022-12-07 17:08:32] <FloHost> chat can the misericorde still 1 shot w/ the dagger talisman?
[2022-12-07 17:08:36] <paula_smiley> @Pallydan9K so we stay lvl 125?

[2022-12-07 17:11:59] <%$Leonardo_07> 150 is where people that dont like 125 goes to.
[2022-12-07 17:12:04] <%$Mercedes_FluffleBuns> I'm thinking 300 is perfect oroSmug
[2022-12-07 17:12:04] <+marvinleonbutlerii> 150 feels good; at 125 people are running specialized one shot builds
[2022-12-07 17:12:18] <+marvinleonbutlerii> 125 feels like the cheese level
[2022-12-07 17:12:21] <%+Illuna_Meira> oh yes the grace on their head states the winner! if both team has it it means its stalemate
[2022-12-07 17:12:24] <%+Illuna_Meira> see
[2022-12-07 17:12:26] <@%Pallydan9K> the idea is 125 connects to 150 anyway
[2022-12-07 17:12:37] <BravillanLive> @pallydan9k no it doesnt
[2022-12-07 17:12:41] <@%Pallydan9K> why not
[2022-12-07 17:12:42] <AdNauseumTendrils> its those dudes that won, right?
[2022-12-07 17:12:42] <FloHost> at 150, people have everything in their arsenal. its cheese
[2022-12-07 17:12:51] <BravillanLive> its 10% plus 10 like older games
[2022-12-07 17:12:57] <@%Pallydan9K> that's only with the red sign
[2022-12-07 17:13:00] <$hollowlurker> 150 is fine for a casual meta for players who don't want to stop leveling their character 2/3 through the game
[2022-12-07 17:13:00] <@%Pallydan9K> invasions do connect
[2022-12-07 17:13:01] <BravillanLive> so 142 is max 125 can match with
[2022-12-07 17:13:07] <FloHost> 150 is objectively worse
[2022-12-07 17:13:13] <%$Leonardo_07> 150? Just go max level and have everything. lol
[2022-12-07 17:13:14] <+marvinleonbutlerii> @flohost at lower levels, you can run highly specialized cheesy builds that one shot people; no ones getting one shot at 150
[2022-12-07 17:13:15] <BravillanLive> yea invasions do if you're 125
[2022-12-07 17:13:26] <BravillanLive> 150 cant go down though if they invade
[2022-12-07 17:13:32] <@%Pallydan9K> that is true
[2022-12-07 17:13:48] <BravillanLive> so yea i guess you can be ganked by 150s at 125

[2022-12-07 17:14:15] <FloHost> 150 is much worse than 125
[2022-12-07 17:14:22] <%anom96> that was cinematic lol
[2022-12-07 17:14:22] <+marvinleonbutlerii> @leonardo_07 lol 200 is 50 points higher than 150

[2022-12-07 17:14:35] <%$Leonardo_07> @marvinleonbutlerii Exactly.
[2022-12-07 17:14:43] <%+Illuna_Meira> its still a stalemate
[2022-12-07 17:14:44] <BravillanLive> at 150 you can full bullgoat caster build so
[2022-12-07 17:14:44] <%+Illuna_Meira> god

[2022-12-07 17:15:23] <plethoraoflies> you can still build 125 to use any weapon/spell so idk why that's an argument
[2022-12-07 17:15:27] <%$Leonardo_07> And since DS1 we all know that meta level is 387.
[2022-12-07 17:15:27] <+marvinleonbutlerii> Idk ive just played and seen both, every yourube video on er is boring because its low level pvp with one dude who clearly has a perfectly optimized low level cheese build one tapping people with less than 60 vit
[2022-12-07 17:15:29] <%A2345667> 125 is just a pseudo meta for duels

[2022-12-07 17:15:52] <BravillanLive> 150 can do too much
[2022-12-07 17:16:05] <+marvinleonbutlerii> 150 is the natural progression of the game
[2022-12-07 17:16:11] <FloHost> at 150, the meta is nonexistant since you can go full bullgoats no matter the build
[2022-12-07 17:16:27] <BravillanLive> @marvinleonbutlerii yea roughly
[2022-12-07 17:16:27] <%+Illuna_Meira> wait
[2022-12-07 17:16:31] <%+Illuna_Meira> the grace disappeared

[2022-12-07 17:16:42] <BravillanLive> i purposefully stopped levelling for pvp at 125
[2022-12-07 17:16:43] <$hollowlurker> you can go full bullgoats at any level with the equip load tear
[2022-12-07 17:16:46] <plethoraoflies> i honestly dont think the difference is that big, I think people are just hung up on the old meta level and can;t let go. elden ring naturally takes you much higher, so the meta should be higher imo
[2022-12-07 17:16:48] <%sloowmocean> You guys can do a Legalos and Gimli cosplay. :)

[2022-12-07 17:52:13] <LucasUnzaga> @Abomition yeah now it is possible with the new update

[2022-12-07 17:52:26] <+enigmatic247> @Abomition it is possible now but only in the colloseum, not in the open world
[2022-12-07 17:52:26] <nuka99gaming> @SekonSanyt its not with a sword its with a rapier
[2022-12-07 17:52:34] <TheRealWholehorse> @GotenSD no one knows yet, but I'm guessing it's based on summon range like DS3
[2022-12-07 17:52:36] <+Abomition> @Abomition even in the arena?! that's sooo good !!
[2022-12-07 17:52:41] <+Abomition> thank you guys

[2022-12-07 18:07:20] <sewerperson22> is it only me that is bored of every game trying to be a movie? like choice story games are fun but like for me last of us and stuff like that dont work
[2022-12-07 18:07:26] <TheValiantBob> I personally like 138 since it lets you both duel and invade from 125-150
[2022-12-07 18:07:36] <Kamitama23> If GoW steals goty I will lose my shit
[2022-12-07 18:07:40] <!%+AstralUmbra> by running into a free aimed moon
