[2022-12-07 13:22:07] <Buizeru> They buffed her primary, and now she has a better left click, and her right click still right clicks the important targets with a pocket. Even if she didn't have a pocket, most targets she hits aren't usually full HP
[2022-12-07 13:22:07] <Bleiz3r_> she also can oneshot with mercy

[2022-12-07 13:22:59] <Bleiz3r_> i agree but when they nerfed ashe a long time ago the took in consideration the one shot with mercy
[2022-12-07 13:23:12] <+treadweazy> And the charge still lasts pretty long before seclining
[2022-12-07 13:23:13] <Fixxer14> this is the new map PauseChamp

[2022-12-07 13:24:20] <Buizeru> the devs argue its because the average player needs the buff because shes not that great for them

[2022-12-07 13:25:02] <Fixxer14> even in plat, gold she is OP AF
[2022-12-07 13:25:16] <TolenaVR> they should nerf genji even more then cause in low rank genji is still strong LUL
[2022-12-07 13:25:25] <Fixxer14> i got one shot from a far away from her
[2022-12-07 13:25:29] <Bleiz3r_> she is still annoying af at plat/diamond, are they balancing for silver? i mean ok
[2022-12-07 13:25:30] <halldrix> well low rank players are like 85% of overwatch population
[2022-12-07 13:25:41] <Saturdaywww> thats why mercy pistol hitbox is the size of a house xD
[2022-12-07 13:25:45] <%bebex001_> @halldrix more like 95%
[2022-12-07 13:25:45] <r3661316> Yea and whatever charge you get from dueling could almost always let you win plus the Disruptior
[2022-12-07 13:25:49] <@%emmy_ish> i never had issues with sojourn in my comp games, i feel like i'm weirdly missing out LUL
[2022-12-07 13:25:53] <Buizeru> I think shes strong in the lower levels but not technically for her rail gun, but her mobility, suppression pressure and her aoe thing
[2022-12-07 13:25:55] <2belr> yesterday i said i destroy in plat with soljourn and kragie rosted the fuck out of me PepeHands @Fixxer14
[2022-12-07 13:26:16] <TolenaVR> @kragiee why isn't genji getting nerfed more then cause genji is so good in gold woopsAYAYA
[2022-12-07 13:26:24] <%Freewheelin_au> you can relative to your elo imo
[2022-12-07 13:26:29] <Shubyy1> @halldrix balancing a game around casuals is what kills the game, look at overwatch 1
[2022-12-07 13:26:46] <NDumitrascu> i mean widow should be useless in lower ranks but they are not buffing it
[2022-12-07 13:26:50] VIEWERS: 2¬†927
[2022-12-07 13:27:00] <%bebex001_> well it's all about the mindset blizzard has for OW. And they clearly want to make it a casual game not a competitive game with all the ranking changes. so i can understand them balancing for 95% not the top 5% kayewhSippy
[2022-12-07 13:27:02] <jcap28> @TolenaVR idk man most gold soljourn are better than genji
[2022-12-07 13:27:07] <Fixxer14> you haven't seen gold in eu KEKW
[2022-12-07 13:27:08] <itzstazey> Genji not OP in Silver,Gold,Plat. It‚Äôs just his nano blade kekw
[2022-12-07 13:27:17] <ninelie08> i swear good genji player were always in my lobby

[2022-12-07 13:27:45] <regjus> Thats true
[2022-12-07 13:27:54] <%agiro01> who doesn't moira beat tho LUL
[2022-12-07 13:27:55] <Buizeru> well you have to think about the player that has to fight off the hero, even if the Genji is bad, the support player will struggle to track it or move away from it
[2022-12-07 13:27:56] <itzstazey> Bro the only thing OP about him is literally just nano blade other than that he‚Äôs not that strong
[2022-12-07 13:27:57] <Saturdaywww> hear me out... mercy dmg boosted moira :)
[2022-12-07 13:27:58] <halldrix> @halldrix no new content is what kill OW1

[2022-12-07 13:28:14] <+SaraaKayy> @TolenaVR they spend half their time in widow hs only custom games lmao
[2022-12-07 13:28:20] <%bebex001_> that's why i play moira against genji mains
[2022-12-07 13:28:22] <%bebex001_> KEKW
[2022-12-07 13:28:24] <daginguh> moira is stupid in general. her alt needs a rework

[2022-12-07 13:28:56] <crabf> what i dont get is why kiriko didnt get a damage nerf when her arms literally got smaller

[2022-12-07 13:29:06] <Fixxer14> i think sojourn is really good with people who know how to aim but also its not that hard to aim with her
[2022-12-07 13:29:31] <xGenero> this map looks hard to attack
[2022-12-07 13:29:38] <caligula_infinity> lets goooo new drops

[2022-12-07 13:30:45] <TolenaVR> @kragiee you find it by watching youtube videos when other pro widows play enough of the map

[2022-12-07 15:11:46] <jakethasnake> @Miketcha i think his ult is really good ppl just not paying passive enough
[2022-12-07 15:11:52] <+zinx_7> is sojourn still useable
[2022-12-07 15:11:55] <+EnvyusPug> Did they like basically buff sojourn in a sense

[2022-12-07 15:13:07] <Miketcha> @jakethasnake i think because the timer doesnt reset when someone exits his ult and reenters, his ult should be at like 5 seconds with no one in it
[2022-12-07 15:13:11] <jakethasnake> changing the DPS passive was weird, i dont really get it

[2022-12-07 15:13:35] <mazzawoollza> I can't believe they only changed Ana sleep from 15>14s PRIMARILY because of Kiriko, that screams busted
[2022-12-07 15:13:39] <+Rox0ra> @exactvenus Man the Ram, pharah and junker skin on the battle pass are pretty fire.  The rest not so much

[2022-12-07 15:14:06] <mazzawoollza> Ana sleep shoulda be 12 sec

[2022-12-07 15:14:45] <mazzawoollza> but if they changed sleep to line up with how annoying Suzu (literally quoting patch notes) then should be lower
[2022-12-07 15:14:46] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> just more ammo for ana
[2022-12-07 15:14:47] <+Rox0ra> Ana got that 1 second cool down.  woo.
[2022-12-07 15:14:52] <ghostrobotfifa> Normal to get absolutely awful team mates when season refreshes ?
[2022-12-07 15:14:52] <jakethasnake> @Miketcha i think the idea is that you pop it when in you're in there mixing it up, but at high level its probably not as good, im only gold 1 LUL
[2022-12-07 15:14:54] <PapaRisu> don't change ana pls monkaSHAKE

[2022-12-07 15:15:27] <mazzawoollza> exactly, Hog loses to Ana but Suzu makes the matchup more balanced but if Hog mirror u have to run Ana and Kiri
[2022-12-07 15:15:27] <ibimd22> BRIGG TRASH
[2022-12-07 15:15:30] <+thesneakyfart> why no kiriko/ana combo

[2022-12-07 15:15:32] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> if Ana had an escape itd be better

[2022-12-07 15:16:00] <jakethasnake> ana / kuriko has basically no defensive ult
[2022-12-07 15:16:00] <mazzawoollza> also luc lack of healing allows Kiri to build up quicker ults btw

[2022-12-07 15:16:20] <%+shytan> Hog to 600hp orisa cooldowns extended a little bit dva matrix lose a second or half a second increase booster cooldown kiriko suzu cooldown increase

[2022-12-07 15:20:02] <mazzawoollza> 960p is better than 1080p for games like OW because bitrate compared to rez
[2022-12-07 15:20:15] <mazzawoollza> but 810p makes the game look crisp but not pixel out when turning, many ults, etc

[2022-12-07 15:23:43] <%+EnvyusPug> Was the stream just stuttering like a minute ago>
[2022-12-07 15:23:46] <jakethasnake> you dont really need more than 6k unless you are running 1440p and for that you need Fiber
[2022-12-07 15:24:07] <%+Draykkyn> Pretty sure he tabbed over to something LUL
[2022-12-07 15:24:09] <mazzawoollza> @jakethasnake nawh bro some people like stream effectively lossy 1080p
[2022-12-07 15:24:39] <sKantei> wtf tracer lol
[2022-12-07 15:24:42] <%smokey> anyone can stream at 8k bitrate you just have to check ignore service limits in OBS. you're just making your audience that has slow internet speeds suffer
[2022-12-07 15:24:48] <!%Mikeverv> Yes a bit smaller

[2022-12-07 15:24:53] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> you do
[2022-12-07 15:24:55] <danieltalkthai> you do get smaller
[2022-12-07 15:24:57] <+thesneakyfart> that's factual
[2022-12-07 15:25:02] <jakethasnake> well thats because twitch has problems with 1080p, the bandwith is insanely high @mazzawoollza
[2022-12-07 15:25:02] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> you get longer by laying down at night
[2022-12-07 15:25:03] <%smokey> if you don't have resolution options that is

[2022-12-07 15:25:12] <mazzawoollza> @smokey also this, there are people who thrash streams too high when they're small and basically cull their viewers base before it happens

[2022-12-07 15:28:27] <jakethasnake> i will have to look into it but i stream on 720 because its been the most stable for me at 6k, but i do not have up to date hardware
[2022-12-07 15:28:53] <sXLXct> Do you create new accounts often?
[2022-12-07 15:28:53] <+SgtJohnsonsJohnson> im thinking games like Valorant would matter a lot more with sniping
[2022-12-07 15:28:55] <%smokey> yeah to make things look really nice you have to tweak the encoder options
[2022-12-07 15:28:59] <mazzawoollza> @jakethasnake 720p does not require 6k, go back to 4.5-5
[2022-12-07 15:29:17] <mazzawoollza> @smokey or just use 30-40 series NVENC Kappa

[2022-12-07 15:40:04] <exactvenus> You can but it is ass for gaming
[2022-12-07 15:40:04] <mazzawoollza> yes but CPU is way less efficient

[2022-12-07 15:40:10] <mazzawoollza> that's why NVENC is popular

[2022-12-07 15:40:20] <mazzawoollza> the GPU does encoding way better, so you can game same time
[2022-12-07 15:40:21] <IBeatsIX> isn't 2 pc streaming is way more complicated than 1
[2022-12-07 15:40:21] <%+EnvyusPug> I want the plant back sadge
[2022-12-07 15:40:24] <mazzawoollza> CPU gets eaten up
[2022-12-07 15:40:24] <imDyrk> the game doesnt need that much cpu does it?
[2022-12-07 15:40:31] <!%Mikeverv> @completeglobalsaturation No
[2022-12-07 15:40:34] <%smokey> if you have a newer gpu then encoding on that is going to be better for single pc
[2022-12-07 15:40:41] <insuficientsauce> how broken is doom
[2022-12-07 15:40:45] <mazzawoollza> so basically you're offloading the CPU load to another PC, and in turn, a better stream qual

[2022-12-07 15:40:58] <imDyrk> I mean I rip my pc with shit ton of synths and plugins to hit it max i dont think ow can even reach 20% cpu capacity
[2022-12-07 15:40:59] <mazzawoollza> NVENC way more effecient than 264x.

[2022-12-07 15:41:36] <mazzawoollza> @imDyrk once you factoring in other apps like spotify, OBS by itself + streaming and recording, game with high capped FPS... it adds up
[2022-12-07 15:42:06] <mazzawoollza> anyway Krag just use NVENC because it's OW and you are rank 1 DPS
[2022-12-07 15:42:11] <mazzawoollza> it makes a 15% DIFF
[2022-12-07 15:42:12] <imDyrk> @mazzawoollza yeah that might be, still need to try it myself see how is it going
[2022-12-07 15:42:15] <+crocswsocks> depends on the game
[2022-12-07 15:42:24] <%smokey> it's a pretty big difference. plus your game will feel better. less stress on your PC
[2022-12-07 15:42:28] <mazzawoollza> no because you're using NVENC which is GPU
[2022-12-07 15:42:29] <jakethasnake> i stream off a 1060 and an i7-6700k and it plays this game fine lol just have to run on performance mode
[2022-12-07 15:42:40] <%smokey> people say GPU encoding doesn't stress the GPU but it absolutely does
[2022-12-07 15:42:43] <raono_> hey @kragiee do you think tracer is kinda op now?
[2022-12-07 15:42:55] <mazzawoollza> @smokey cap bro, modern day NVENC is sooo efficient

[2022-12-07 17:33:35] <CheeseWilson> this maps rough
[2022-12-07 17:33:49] <%+EnvyusPug> played this map once and didnt like it even on defence

[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <CheeseWilson> @kingdomofblue i feel like it favors snipers too

[2022-12-07 17:38:07] <%+EnvyusPug> and the defenders majority of the time have high ground
[2022-12-07 17:38:11] <JesssOW> ow1 was fun until they added ana
[2022-12-07 17:38:16] <4bitclover> @Minardi_ ow2 is ow1 except for the 5v5 for the most part.

[2022-12-07 17:48:22] <fitori_> she's a really good midrange now
[2022-12-07 17:48:51] <%smokey> i think she's pretty well balanced now
[2022-12-07 17:48:52] [Notification] exo0h subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[2022-12-07 17:49:01] <+JTap7> I don‚Äôt think they wanted her to be completely nerfed, just more viable in lower tiers while not completely being overpowered in high tiers
[2022-12-07 17:49:06] <+tm_901> theyve just made her a better soldier?

[2022-12-07 17:49:41] <kingdomofblue> This map looks way more cancer than Anubis and for some reason they thought it was a good idea for OW2

[2022-12-07 17:51:55] <Alzerial> do you think tracer needed the buff?
[2022-12-07 17:51:59] <regjus> Ngl i hate how people dont know how to play hero or aim in result it gets the hero a buff
[2022-12-07 17:52:48] <gatix_x> its a "balance" patch @kragiee .... nerfing others to "buff" (dont touch doom) will be the same.....
[2022-12-07 17:53:04] <exactvenus> waiting for that genji buff.
[2022-12-07 17:53:27] <ddesolace> you dont think that it would just be easier to balance if they just scaled up the HP bars like league or other games? @kragiee
[2022-12-07 17:53:32] <exactvenus> 100 damage? all the roster has 150+ health
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <ddesolace> not just tracer every character damage
[2022-12-07 17:53:59] <gatix_x> if you nerf all the tanks, tanks arent going to be played.
[2022-12-07 17:53:59] <+dr_proctor_11> what dps do you think should be changed to support?(as they have suggested they may do)
[2022-12-07 17:54:04] <gatix_x> as in ow1
[2022-12-07 17:54:06] <mattaow> What change would u want to see in tank
[2022-12-07 17:54:08] <ddesolace> so that 5 and 6 damage wont be an insane change
[2022-12-07 17:54:12] <regjus> Exactly what blizzard are doing and planning KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:54:12] <+tm_901> how would you change it
[2022-12-07 17:54:13] <lecam82> MarkTasty
[2022-12-07 17:54:41] <zach2sheisty> @tm_901 is that the juiciest apricot?
[2022-12-07 17:54:46] <laugerosendal> who do uj think is the most OP dps,tank and healer?
[2022-12-07 17:54:53] <+ZefiTV> I like how they always bring up "data" to nerf characters but they know tanks outdamage dps every single time and dont do something
[2022-12-07 17:54:57] <+3redlight> ayyyyy leave my hog boi alone
[2022-12-07 17:55:04] <lecam82> HmmNotes
[2022-12-07 17:55:11] <+tm_901> @zach2sheisty lol im pretending i didnt see it
[2022-12-07 17:55:11] <Mr_Bibbles> sounds like a dps wet dream jeeze
[2022-12-07 17:55:12] <I4mAnnoying> They are unkillable at right conditions basically
[2022-12-07 17:55:25] <%exo0h> I feel like people don't really heal anymore.. kragieCry
[2022-12-07 17:55:37] <zach2sheisty> @tm_901 lol PowerUpL SUBprise PowerUpR
[2022-12-07 17:55:38] <lecam82> open Q OMEGALULiguess
[2022-12-07 17:55:39] <I4mAnnoying> Tanks are just dps with insane health
[2022-12-07 17:55:43] <ludrs> HmmmOK
[2022-12-07 17:55:48] <ddesolace> also makes tank diff so fucking painful to play
[2022-12-07 17:56:01] <lecam82> KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:56:10] <gatix_x> all i want to say is, i cant wait ow3 with 4v4
[2022-12-07 17:56:17] <shiftdrago> @exo0h deah and noone peels for them
[2022-12-07 17:56:18] <arash0066> WHY is everyone so obssesed with nerfing DPS worst tank is betters than than 90% of DPS and in support everyone can vanish or become invulnerable except zen.
[2022-12-07 17:56:27] <laugerosendal> who do u think are the most OP dps, tank and healer
[2022-12-07 17:56:39] <regjus> As a guy who gets shit on dm by tanks while queuing agree KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:56:49] <exactvenus> HOG, KIRIKO and TRACER
[2022-12-07 17:56:55] <+ClownSlick> I can see the logic behind it. They didn't want que times to be shit because no one wants to play tank, but instead they made it the longest que/best role.
[2022-12-07 17:57:03] <blackichan13> Oh wow juicy oh wow
[2022-12-07 17:57:08] <+iSeraphh> That guys neck makes me uncomfortable
[2022-12-07 17:57:13] <%+chinuthor94> Tanks should be able to survive more, not damage more
[2022-12-07 17:57:24] <ludrs> chills
[2022-12-07 17:57:41] <ddesolace> its dumb though, they just need to make good and fun tanks, theres not a lack of tank players in other mobas, the only diff is that in ow theyre boring
[2022-12-07 17:57:49] <lecam82> Phara peepoSleep
[2022-12-07 17:57:55] <shiftdrago> @iseraphh only his neck?! his whole existance annoys and scares me
[2022-12-07 17:57:57] <exactvenus> Yeah but if tanks have no dmg, since they were so adamant on removing hard CC from tanks they can just be ignored
[2022-12-07 17:58:09] <thecriticm> spy kids 3

[2022-12-07 17:59:47] <jakethasnake> :)
[2022-12-07 18:00:02] <ddesolace> @iSeraphh sorry, in other games where characters use abilities to attack other characters, the tanks are actually fun to play*
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <spicykurii> THat was the point. Low elo players made her look worse than widow

[2022-12-07 18:00:29] <arash0066> theres a reason most people play tanks cuz if you play supprt u might end u quiting the game or worse if u play DPS u will go on suicide prevention

[2022-12-07 18:01:58] <4bitclover> @santasnooze that's literally what they did, the 2 is just for marketing
[2022-12-07 18:02:32] <ludrs> and thefree part is just to open the game up to the new generation

[2022-12-07 18:03:14] <ZylTheNiceGuy> @ludrs whats wrong with being free?
[2022-12-07 18:03:39] <BANGBROTHERS> weird how lucioball isnt going on during fifa
[2022-12-07 18:03:49] <+iSeraphh> You should still get loot boxes, no one would ever spend money on a highlight intro lol
[2022-12-07 18:03:59] <thecriticm> oh the misery
[2022-12-07 18:04:01] <ludrs> @ludrs we have to buy skins now rather than just earning stuff in game id rather pay $60 for the game one off than constantly purchase battlepass and skins
[2022-12-07 18:04:17] <+iSeraphh> Anything other than skins will basically never be bought in the shop
[2022-12-07 18:04:37] <+ImWhispers> @ludrs welcome to the free to play model bud
[2022-12-07 18:04:50] <ludrs> ikr Sadge
[2022-12-07 18:05:04] <4bitclover> @ludrs it's a tradeoff but the free + seasonpass model in theory means more content more frequently vs deadgame with no new content
[2022-12-07 18:05:05] <santasnooze> earn skins in-game and make the huge massive skins or mythic for $$ would be better

[2022-12-07 18:16:15] <exactvenus> @ddesolace Forced metas would be fine, if they didnt last the whole fucking season. Also if the heroes got a little tuning so they werent completely fucking baster characters
