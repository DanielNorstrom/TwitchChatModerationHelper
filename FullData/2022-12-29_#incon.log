[2022-12-29 17:17:36] <%+Jagsman119> The opening scene with tom cruise in the plane in maverick is super sick
[2022-12-29 17:17:52] <@%$air2jodran3> @WideBodyJonny in some cases killing a tower means your wave gets pushed up more, meaning it's both harder for you to farm and easier for the enemy to farm. But in most cases it's still better to kill the tower vs intentionally not killing it

[2022-12-29 17:20:28] <%+TruePlewd> dt still overall better

[2022-12-29 19:39:51] <kingamidgods> the smite offical tiamat page doesnt list both stances
[2022-12-29 19:39:52] <%+bababengo> i hate ao kuang so much
[2022-12-29 19:39:58] <BigandFloppyD> @kingamidgods when you execute a jungle buff holding camp, it applies the buff to tiamat, and drops a seperate ground pickup
[2022-12-29 19:40:02] <kingamidgods> ill dive further..game is not open..
[2022-12-29 19:40:04] <%+king0pin> loll remember playon Tower defense in warcraft frozen throne
[2022-12-29 19:40:06] <BigandFloppyD> you can then still get a pickup buff from another camp
[2022-12-29 19:40:11] <@%$air2jodran3> @kingamidgods I mean we are telling you how to do it
[2022-12-29 19:40:13] <magicfindinc> try explaining an Au Kang to your insurance carrier
[2022-12-29 19:40:13] <%+king0pin> as well as DOTA
[2022-12-29 19:40:15] <BigandFloppyD> can have 1 consumed buff and 1 picked up buff
[2022-12-29 19:40:36] <%+bababengo> ao kuang just hides until *woosh woosh woosh* and eats you
[2022-12-29 19:40:40] <kingamidgods> ye ye..i kinda understand..but its not a guarantee that every tiamat knows it right.
[2022-12-29 19:40:42] <BigandFloppyD> @air2jodran3 basically step by step even LUL

[2022-12-29 19:41:35] <%Danger_Corpse> @kingamidgods Tiamat fires a cone dealing damage and slowing enemies hit. Minions, Large Monsters or Buff Holders hit under a health threshold are executed. Tiamat can immediately consume her Serpent and Beast pets to provide a Hardened Scale. When Tiamat consumes a Buff Holder she gains their buff while the original can still be picked up by allies. This allows Tiamat to pick up a second buff as well. Tiamat can only have one consumed and one regular buff at a time.
[2022-12-29 19:41:46] <@%$air2jodran3> @kingamidgods it's not a guarantee anyone knows anything if they don't read the ability
[2022-12-29 19:41:57] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @air2jodran3 lol
[2022-12-29 19:41:58] <%Danger_Corpse> It is listed in the ground stance description of her 1 ability.

[2022-12-29 19:43:43] <@%$air2jodran3> @Danger_Corpse I'm assuming it was a joke considering even just the first word you said is Tiamat
[2022-12-29 19:43:45] <kingamidgods> yea but ive looked on to 3 pages and they only list the other stance 1 spell

[2022-12-29 19:46:08] <BigandFloppyD> @kingamidgods i wouldnt recommend trying to use websites for stance changing gods, they sometimes are missing the abilities for the other stance, usually the one they dont default start in

[2022-12-29 23:42:49] <%heterochromia98> @pilomaxos Sometimes, when people make god requests. Surely not now tho, since he's not live
[2022-12-29 23:42:50] <MrHoarfrost> Pretty sure the sub games are only for subs that are in the discord
[2022-12-29 23:43:02] <MrHoarfrost> also only applies when he is playing
[2022-12-29 23:43:02] <+spacehag> smite fam, is this the last week to use viewer points before they start fresh?
[2022-12-29 23:43:07] <@%^StreamElements> Buy your gems and videogames here and support the twitchiest community(All Platforms) https://www.nexus.gg/incon/in-game-content

[2022-12-29 23:43:42] <%siv0r> no @spacehag that'll prob be 1/24
[2022-12-29 23:43:42] <+preacha843> and have to pay to play. but i mean if you stream i guess its worth not playing with ppl you think may be bad and get paid for it
[2022-12-29 23:44:14] <%heterochromia98> @preacha843 You don't hasve to pay to play. Only to make god requests

[2022-12-29 23:45:41] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> there were supposed to be 2, muai and another
[2022-12-29 23:45:43] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> they backed off
[2022-12-29 23:45:50] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> to put more effort into year 10
[2022-12-29 23:46:05] <+preacha843> well dang
[2022-12-29 23:46:06] <%siv0r> oh hi @MichaelxVoorheees inconLincoln
[2022-12-29 23:46:09] <+xitsyoboiii> Is this game fun again?
[2022-12-29 23:46:17] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> not really atm
[2022-12-29 23:46:18] <+preacha843> so theyll have 6 or jus 5 for season 10?
[2022-12-29 23:46:21] <+spacehag> @xitsyoboiii yes
[2022-12-29 23:46:34] <%siv0r> fun is subjective
[2022-12-29 23:46:38] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> smites usually troll and bland at end of year. jan 24 is next season/ year10
[2022-12-29 23:46:42] <%siv0r> that said, smite is objectively not fun Kappa

[2022-12-29 23:46:58] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @preacha843 i dont know tbh aliwayDisco
[2022-12-29 23:46:59] <+preacha843> @xitsyoboiii yes. i only play unranked but wanna get better to play ranked tho. lol
[2022-12-29 23:47:07] <+spacehag> the runescape event is pretty fun imo
[2022-12-29 23:47:14] <+xitsyoboiii> I see ... its still a 50/50 lol
[2022-12-29 23:47:25] <+preacha843> i still have fun.
[2022-12-29 23:47:27] <+preacha843> lol
[2022-12-29 23:47:35] <%siv0r> I find it fun but I play at a way lower level than these folks
[2022-12-29 23:47:37] <+preacha843> mostly. lol
[2022-12-29 23:47:53] <+preacha843> same @siv0r
[2022-12-29 23:47:53] <+xitsyoboiii> Preacha do play unranked until you learn the game...otherwise you gonna encounter a lot of negativity lol
[2022-12-29 23:48:10] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> its the same in ranked and casual
[2022-12-29 23:48:25] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> there is no diffrence except seeing mmr and there being a ban/pick phase
[2022-12-29 23:48:31] <+spacehag> you can't just jump into ranked conquest anyway, you have to have so many wins on unranked
[2022-12-29 23:48:39] <@VirusBot> Don't forget to use !highlight [tag] whenever something cool happens on stream. Use it responsibly.
