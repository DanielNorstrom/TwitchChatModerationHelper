[2023-01-03 10:39:08] <mmm_dogwater_yum> it's one of those games that everyone played with friends/fam and think they're goated at until they play someone who has actually practiced. Chess, backgammon, smash, badminton, table tennis, pool
[2023-01-03 10:39:10] <babaaaaayaga> lmao
[2023-01-03 10:39:13] <siddjai> to avoid cheating i guess , once you've picked up a piece and put it down you can't change
[2023-01-03 10:39:14] <%latenightenjoyer> i think blitz 3+2 is fine for casuals, very little thinking but managable if you play often, rapid is too long for casuals, people take ages to move
