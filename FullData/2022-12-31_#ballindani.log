[2022-12-31 06:54:03] <@%ratprime66> I think for brig I‚Äôd kinda like if they increased inspire heals, i like her as an aoe healer but like inspire is the same healing rate as Lucio, so it‚Äôs not great ballin45Blankie
[2022-12-31 06:54:08] <%+Valcanix> i noticed that his ROF is pretty good

[2022-12-31 06:54:35] <%FATALHERMIT> @ratprime66 might as well play lucio then
[2022-12-31 06:55:11] <Valcanix> lucio has alway been a solid pick. can duel plus beat and speed are amazing

[2022-12-31 06:57:16] <%+Valcanix> @ratprime66 is why i dont pick brig rn as a support flex. find kirko and mercy strong picks rn since you can boost sojurns and reapers
[2022-12-31 06:57:23] <%+Valcanix> and the occasional rein
[2022-12-31 06:57:50] <@%ratprime66> @valcanix I feel like brig pretty weak and really situational, but I just want to play her ballin45Blankie
[2022-12-31 06:58:47] <%+Valcanix> yee is a lil annoying. brig looks like so much fun but in terms of support i think the only thing unique about her is she can help create tiny amounts of space

[2022-12-31 07:01:22] <%+Valcanix> honestly, play what you enjoy, both me and my lucio maining twin are metaslaves and we find being stronger fun but if you find playing one hero boring switch things up. its a game after all.
[2022-12-31 07:01:41] <%FATALHERMIT> she's good if you need someone to babysit your ana
[2022-12-31 07:02:27] <%+Valcanix> tru but lucio is also good at that job with the speed boost to help escape. and lucio can do alot of dmg

[2022-12-31 07:04:18] <%+Valcanix> like my twin just goes balls to the walls 90% of the time and gets like 15k+ heals and at least 4-6k dmg
[2022-12-31 07:04:20] <@%ratprime66> For me on brig it feels like you gotta be very consistent with whip shot to get inspire without feeding and even then it‚Äôs like difficult with very little reward
[2022-12-31 07:04:51] <%+Valcanix> @ratprime66 catNODDING whip shot is also a good finshers too
[2022-12-31 07:04:56] <@%ratprime66> Though her whipshot on defense can actually be so good on stalling points and keeping tanks or close range heros away from team
