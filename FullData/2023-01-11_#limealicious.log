[2023-01-11 02:16:31] <%+WYSTIKUS> the combat can be very unfair sometimes
[2023-01-11 02:16:32] <calantlar> big fan of love limited saves
[2023-01-11 02:16:32] <%FieldMedic4077> I thought you could turn that off but maybe not limesHmm
[2023-01-11 02:16:33] <%nickjaquez26> Kinda
[2023-01-11 02:16:34] <sangdream> I always play with infinite saves mod
[2023-01-11 02:16:35] <%1Neocross1> as long as you dont scum, unlimited is fine
[2023-01-11 02:16:36] <%Azurika_> nah, i modded that out early
[2023-01-11 02:16:37] <ChromiumFox> there a re a lot of autosaves
[2023-01-11 02:16:37] <derap41> only an issue early on
[2023-01-11 02:16:38] <+Busterinabox> Yeah I modded in a perma potion, but I limited it.
[2023-01-11 02:16:39] <%accidentalcoincidence> @Limealicious it does save for free when you exit the game
[2023-01-11 02:16:44] <+Drakxii> I don't like the limited saves
[2023-01-11 02:16:48] <%falsezangetsu> and yeah teh Herb anim is a rough one to keep. i think i used one that sped it up
[2023-01-11 02:16:50] <%+1979HondaAccord> did they get pro lockspicking consultant Todd Howard
[2023-01-11 02:16:53] <%RedDeadmeat> too janky for limited saves
[2023-01-11 02:16:58] <%+erumir> You can just go to sleep, but I would just edit myself lots of Schnapps
[2023-01-11 02:16:58] <+LinkR1987> the saves could be justified because this game CAN get crashy
[2023-01-11 02:16:59] <Prelude2Madness> i dont like limited saves in general
[2023-01-11 02:17:00] <%Renkage> That's fine too, I liked them because they made actions have consequences

[2023-01-11 02:17:07] <%dinnydanny777> Nah
[2023-01-11 02:17:09] <+LeyRex> There is a settings option for lock picking I think

[2023-01-11 02:17:19] <%+1979HondaAccord> just get an NFL doctor to look at it
[2023-01-11 02:17:20] <Wastedtrojan> Savior Schnapps are really easy to brew, so I just go with limited saves
