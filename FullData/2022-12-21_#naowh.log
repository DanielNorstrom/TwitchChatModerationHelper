[2022-12-21 19:10:04] <%constantinvaldor_> @RestorationShaman well, feels like he is the one who needs the least attention as well  but like everyone and its mother plays one so i am afraid you dont get groups
[2022-12-21 19:10:06] <ChankonabeBot> @constantinvaldor_ Prot warrior is by far the easiest of the two. It takes less damage and has its fair share of panic buttons while BDK will be bouncing up and down on hp due to its usage of healing.

[2022-12-21 19:10:55] <%+RestorationShaman> @RestorationShaman thats a bad take, a tank is a tank if the group needs one or not. you have a better chance of being invited as a prot warr with that being "meta"

[2022-12-21 20:27:01] <aemithil> dk can immune the blow back
[2022-12-21 20:27:06] <ChankonabeBot> I believe it is because of Death's Advance
[2022-12-21 20:27:08] <ChankonabeBot> Ya
[2022-12-21 20:27:17] <aemithil> which helps in positioning the boss on 6th push
