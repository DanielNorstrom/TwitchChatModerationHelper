[2023-01-07 05:09:07] <Mr_Metus> Actually this game was inspired by the BL2 DLC
[2023-01-07 05:09:09] <Harmonyx_vt> I started TTW and never finished it. I'm a fan of the Borderlands series, so I was hyped... but it was basically just another game like all the rest and didn't stand out to me.
[2023-01-07 05:09:19] <$Acornfiend> Maybe also check out the game "Forgive me father" .

[2023-01-07 05:38:11] <Harmonyx_vt> of course, I barely beat the main game on hardcore. Most of it wasn't bad, but Heisenberg was a nightmare, as was the Chris section right after it.

[2023-01-07 05:40:24] <%+lts_Brandon_> it's the heart rate of the air ok

[2023-01-07 08:40:44] <%SunlightOnTheMorningTide> Sounding is the act of inserting a metal rod into your urethra. Sounding tubes are meant to be used medically, but some people figured out that they experience sexual pleasure from the act. The reason for this being that the sounding tube can reach very sensitive parts inside your penis that, if stimulated, can create some very intense orgasms.
