[2022-12-19 01:27:30] <+and0rio> although it was probably just some automod for "scripe", he did have like 50k people watching.  @chief_wiecke not that obviously :)
[2022-12-19 01:27:56] <@%B3nbu> but they put scripe as automod
[2022-12-19 01:27:57] <ZetQQ> @and0rio Timing out/banning for comments like this is cringe ngl
[2022-12-19 01:28:11] <+FENceless> I watch naowh and firedup so idk what's even going on in the "main" channels.
[2022-12-19 01:28:24] <KoBaltdeux> @and0rio What even is the point of a message like that tho ?
[2022-12-19 01:28:26] <+CoopaTroopa92> To be fair Max has talked about how toxic the chats get. Probably just went overboard a bit trying to prevent that from happening.
[2022-12-19 01:28:36] <+FENceless> I'd watch zaelia but he makes me feel bad about being only a decent healer
[2022-12-19 01:28:44] <%doggzyy> @and0rio Exactly
[2022-12-19 01:29:15] <+and0rio> I dunno Ko I typed it on impuse because I got the notice, it was the first stream on the first day

[2022-12-19 01:29:24] <ZetQQ> @CoopaTroopa92 Yeah but the thing is when you give those people attention even if it is to ban them, they come back and others start doing. Best is to just ignore them

[2022-12-19 01:40:25] <%CallmepieLUL> no way liquid kills it that fast. the boss looks so hard and they need to experience every new mechanic
[2022-12-19 01:40:30] <%CallmepieLUL> at least 200 pulls
[2022-12-19 01:40:57] <%Ali1331> The pull counts have been pretty low so far in this raid

[2022-12-19 01:41:23] <%clearsenpai_> unlikely to kill before NA reset, but could be before EU reset
[2022-12-19 01:41:29] <+FENceless> @clearsenpai_ My prediction is thursday or friday for the raz kill
[2022-12-19 01:41:33] <lolriderxd> @CallmepieLUL dont forget the 100mil shield

[2022-12-19 01:41:55] <%CallmepieLUL> 82mil shield is ez 200% increased damage in 30 seconds totally doable
