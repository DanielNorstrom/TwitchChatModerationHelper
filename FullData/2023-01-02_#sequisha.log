[2023-01-02 11:16:01] <LegitGinger1> tarkov needs a new engine this game runs like shit

[2023-01-02 11:16:29] <PositiveTune> I dont know what do you mean Valorant or Fortnite having no cheaters, they have a lot of them but you need to just pay for me. Even pro players playing for money in Valorant were banned for hacking.

[2023-01-02 11:16:31] <%trufearl> what engine is this
[2023-01-02 11:16:31] <%Dr_DD0S> what if all game companies just boycotted making games for 5 years and brought all of the shady illegal cheating rings down
[2023-01-02 11:16:31] <+truemadrag> Amazon cloud have some clever engineers also
[2023-01-02 11:16:35] <randmstring> also, it depends on whether the game is designed around anti cheat or not. EFT very much does not seem to be

[2023-01-02 11:19:36] <+VenturaRBG> im sure its cheap and honestly sucks, just used to say you have a anti cheat without doing anything else
[2023-01-02 11:19:40] <goth_milk> Yeah SOE turned into Daybreak. And I think daybreak got bought out by some Chinese company and it got broken down into smaller divisions

[2023-01-02 11:20:07] <%Dr_DD0S> @hulkhan it's hard to hire for people and tell them to just look at game footage all day. Classic MMOs used to have a huge game master staff and pay people shit minimum wage and worked shit hours
[2023-01-02 11:20:07] <%Attckcat> @hulkhan my assumption is the server code is really sloppy and lazy so its hard to validate a lot of things, like just stealing from other players inventories KEKLEO

[2023-01-02 11:21:15] <JaynisK> @goth_milk Nah, that's not what happened at all. They did get bought up, but it's a Swedish company that owns a few other game studios, like Piranha games.(mechwarrior 5/MWO devs) I think memebers of daybreak actually are majority holders in the company or something too.

[2023-01-02 18:19:44] <JaynisK> @SelDaw0w As others said, when they added the extra slots, they removed the dedicated compass bind. Now you have to assign it to a hotbar like FAKs/bandages/etc. Though, last wipe, every time you die, you have to rebind it. Probably haven't changed that.
