[2022-12-10 04:42:16] <CromaaOW> diamond is the rank where people think they're starting to get good so they get an ego and get hardstuck

[2022-12-10 04:46:35] <CromaaOW> the thing about infinite avoids is
[2022-12-10 04:46:35] <wolfen1030> I feel like at least 5 avoid slots would be good

[2022-12-10 04:47:41] <%+OldManFender> most ball players spend their time trying to jebait their own DPS players into engaging first, so they can go in with fewer cooldowns, trade one kill, and then complain about their DPS players for the rest of the match
