[2023-01-09 13:08:58] <@%Chrissy1337> i mean doesnt the name say a lot already KavSKG better RP, longer jailtimes, longer downtimes for hurt characters, stricter rules

[2023-01-09 13:12:04] <%Stealthkillah122> when was the last time you played your crim just curious
[2023-01-09 13:12:17] <%+EmrysorMerlin> I know koil said previously he was looking at having the more you go down the weaker your character is so more likely to die quickly with the hardcore not sure if he still looking at that
[2023-01-09 13:12:19] <NicolaFred> that was so funny, they stole that as a joke
[2023-01-09 13:12:21] <%+MrInquisitor> I still can hear Silent in my head saying "Ooooh nooo"
[2023-01-09 13:12:45] <+hiicks_> Koil was saying there's going to a more in depth medical system, more like 2.0 where if you're down too long you can't speak, it'll tell you what injury you have and if you don't tell the EMS/Doctor what is wrong then you'll have more lingering damage on you
[2023-01-09 13:12:50] <%igorsantanna> hydra robbed gsf houses and had a big brawl in the streets

[2023-01-09 13:20:52] <%flatmilkstain> @Chrissy1337 Just thinking it would be fun to see what new stuff people come up with
[2023-01-09 13:20:52] <%+zack89k> HC will be a fun study for how focus and attitude changes in RP
[2023-01-09 13:20:55] <+HowdyAves> @Chrissy1337 yeah that's true, and Mantis brought that up the other day when i asked him about it

[2023-01-09 13:21:39] <+HowdyAves> however there just NEEDS to be a separation from streamer to character and the names being the same is the a big offender of that

[2023-01-09 14:44:51] <%Senna_Mynx> Wasn't that one of the big things Pred offered back when he first became sheriff of BCSO was promotions
[2023-01-09 14:44:56] <%Senna_Mynx> and thats why so many jumped there
[2023-01-09 14:45:06] <UrbanHangman> people think a title means respect but respect is earned
[2023-01-09 14:45:34] <NNNelson222> CPD seems pretty loyal even though a lot are offered higher positions elsewhere
[2023-01-09 14:45:41] <+StarkstraitosTV> promotions mean nothing. promotions also mean more work.
[2023-01-09 14:45:42] <NNNelson222> like during the LSPD split
[2023-01-09 14:45:50] <JScorpion2> i would agree if there was a lot of movement in DPD ranks but there has been 0
[2023-01-09 14:45:50] <%justins_shotzz> hi
[2023-01-09 14:45:52] <isomeek> Brian has been upfront as said he isn't about promotions for DPD

[2023-01-09 14:46:13] <@%Aaron_TheGod> Rank doesn't mean shit tbh, look when Snow got demoted to Senior from Chief. Everyone was still acting like Snow was their chief because Snow earned that respect NODDERS
[2023-01-09 14:46:22] <+StarkstraitosTV> @nnnelson222 There's a few jumping ship.. but for the most part I think it'll be alright
[2023-01-09 14:46:28] <@%Prollos> @NNNelson222 a number of cpd was going to swap if dupont ran for chief, including hall who said she'd be her asst chief NODDERS

[2023-01-09 16:31:52] <NicolaFred> honestly, everything happens for a reason, i got like that trying to find our house and then the perfect one landed in our lap, we must have looked at 20+ houses and already had sold ours months previously.
