[2022-12-20 07:38:44] <@%syckbrs> not that im saying breakfast food is overrated, which can be eaten at any time of day

[2022-12-20 07:39:06] <%+ArkasHarrok> I love how no one eats like an actual bird because it would kill you. Since they eat up to 3x their own body weight in food.
[2022-12-20 07:39:11] <@%kdlutz> have yall seen those offroad electric bicycles?
[2022-12-20 07:39:15] <djtheyandere5> am good how are you doing maykitDrinky
[2022-12-20 07:39:17] <@%syckbrs> breakfast for me has always been last night's dinner leftovers though, so i'm not a huge breakfast food person
[2022-12-20 07:39:22] <%+ArkasHarrok> But birbs are VERY light in comparison.

[2022-12-20 07:40:28] <Hellspawn_Godfather> tbh, the walk is fun for the exercise and more fun as a flex on my coworkers (I literally walked ten miles in two hours to get here two hours early, I've been working for the last eleven hours with only one hourlong lunchbreak, and I'm STILL doing twice as much work as you?)
[2022-12-20 07:40:32] <Hellspawn_Godfather> But I could use more sleep.

[2022-12-20 07:42:22] <Hellspawn_Godfather> I don't have five consecutive workdays scheduled though - which does mean I don't have a coherent weekend as well, but it's fine with me. I have my Wednesdays for D&D and my Fridays for my sanity, so I only have four days in a row

[2022-12-20 07:45:25] <Hellspawn_Godfather> People tell him he looks like he can't fight but looks like he's seen some shit, so they challenge him, and people bet against him, and he wins. Without fail.

[2022-12-20 09:30:50] <@%^Streamlabs> Tengu are a type of legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. They are a type of mischievous supernatural being. They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.
