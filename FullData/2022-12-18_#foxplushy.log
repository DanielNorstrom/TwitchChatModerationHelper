[2022-12-18 01:04:36] <+rarizy> Yeah put me in coach
[2022-12-18 01:04:44] <%Forestisaname> Oddly enough... I want to learn about Gaelic or Welsh...
[2022-12-18 01:04:46] <Xebrian> @vallenor_ dont know one right now xd
[2022-12-18 01:04:46] <epikpro5> Wo ist dieser Spaziergang
[2022-12-18 01:04:53] <%lolLuxray> is so cozyyy
[2022-12-18 01:04:53] <TARGELION89> Привет как дела?
[2022-12-18 01:04:59] <+emilyrfiona> both
[2022-12-18 01:04:59] <%$Sami_TLW> I prefer normal reading
[2022-12-18 01:05:00] <%Flamin_ingo> both. if you combine the two you learn better
[2022-12-18 01:05:00] <@%$IXT_Daron_TXI> Alright, ya'll, I really can't read all that
[2022-12-18 01:05:00] <%+DaebakJack> Listening fo sure
[2022-12-18 01:05:01] <+emilyrfiona> do both
[2022-12-18 01:05:02] <carlemLive> depends on the person
[2022-12-18 01:05:03] <@%$IXT_Daron_TXI> English only
[2022-12-18 01:05:04] <+arcticsunder> it depends the person
[2022-12-18 01:05:05] <%$Rice4Dinner_> both is good.
[2022-12-18 01:05:06] <%+Mewwio> i think listening
[2022-12-18 01:05:07] <+rarizy> Probably writing
[2022-12-18 01:05:09] <+Xayah_Btw> Reading I think. When you find a word you dont know, you look it up
[2022-12-18 01:05:10] <%flip_flop66> English, roger
[2022-12-18 01:05:11] <sky0c> I’m back foxplushyCroissant
[2022-12-18 01:05:11] <%Vallenor_> @Xebrian  Szczebrzeszyn
[2022-12-18 01:05:11] <Elocticity> depends on your learningt ype
[2022-12-18 01:05:17] <+emilyrfiona> 2 is better than 1!!
[2022-12-18 01:05:18] <%Forestisaname> I learned it with songs and look through transcript...
[2022-12-18 01:05:27] <%$Sami_TLW> Both would definitely be the most efficient
[2022-12-18 01:05:34] <epikpro5> Ich bin jetztes neugierig
[2022-12-18 01:05:36] <%+amanda__b99> Listening would also teach you pronounciation
[2022-12-18 01:05:37] <%Flamin_ingo> if you do both and take short notes, you remember more
[2022-12-18 01:05:37] <%Yovahkiin> as long as you're not zoning out or getting distracted listening is just as good as reading

[2022-12-18 01:05:54] <Xebrian> ok i gonna now really habe fun talking <3 , Good night , dobranoc, Gute nacht All
[2022-12-18 01:05:57] <%+DaebakJack> Reading at the start and then when you have a grasp the listening so you can get pronunciation
[2022-12-18 01:05:58] <%+Byonic_Terror> Yeah dude, looking up words is great
[2022-12-18 01:05:59] <battlefield10066> Both because reading will get you to write it and audio is for pronunciation

[2022-12-18 01:06:26] <%$Sami_TLW> Reading books helped me learn English tremendously
[2022-12-18 01:06:28] <%flip_flop66> To learn a language, I watch a movie with subtitles

[2022-12-18 01:06:29] <%stilcho86> Start with reading. You can maove to listening once the lexical base is good enough. Either you''ll head just a la-la-la

[2022-12-18 01:07:32] <%+amanda__b99> Listening will teach you pronounciation and reading grammar, that´s my take
[2022-12-18 01:07:33] <+emilyrfiona> I wrote "2 is better than 1!" Because leanring through reading AND listing is better than just doing a single thing, I think. But that got deleted I think

[2022-12-18 22:00:20] <feazable> The old Ult was broken, mercies would just let their team die so they could res them all for the POTG
[2022-12-18 22:00:26] <%+Byonic_Terror> At most, I'd give mercy one more rez during ult. or refresh rez as she activates it
[2022-12-18 22:00:45] <monikan_cultist> The most satisfying feeling is when you clown a Mercy + Pharah duo queue.
