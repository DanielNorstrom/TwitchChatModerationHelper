[2022-12-19 16:33:30] <+Quixoticcommand> Is jegantha still bugged? Because with relic you can tap it for mana
[2022-12-19 16:33:35] <rowrow_> I guess demilich is in the same boat, only floating not "flying" flying
[2022-12-19 16:33:38] <%dadconfidand> Huh
[2022-12-19 16:33:38] <%candychane> Now they can tap jegantha for mana
[2022-12-19 16:33:39] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @Aquinas9 An undead god? Insanity.
[2022-12-19 16:33:43] <%Aquinas9> @rowrow_ That's a good compromise. Floating in the lore should mean Menace in the game.

[2022-12-19 16:34:56] <%Aquinas9> @FourDogsInAHorseSuit Dagoth and Sixth House have Ash Vampires, right? And the Neverarine can contract Porphyric Hemophilia.
[2022-12-19 16:34:56] <%+illusions_donate_gg> what would make you think this OP is playing slowly? aspikeOhno

[2022-12-19 16:44:39] <+Coinman1863> I think the monarch is fine in Modern, Initiative seems obscene.
[2022-12-19 16:44:39] <Dreddybajs> @Prodigy_j28 no
[2022-12-19 16:44:50] <Poco_the_turtle> monarch is always draw a card.
[2022-12-19 16:44:51] <%chickenwaffles26> that's why i exclusively play dungeons so my opponents have to learn
[2022-12-19 16:44:55] <%titanoclock> Monarch would be worst
[2022-12-19 16:44:58] <Elevangeline> and then someone hits you and take the initiative and then THEY have to figure out how to venture as well :D
[2022-12-19 16:45:00] <%epicachilles> initiative ends up being great in multiplayer after people understand it, but not really before then
[2022-12-19 16:45:01] <Poco_the_turtle> monarch would be really strong
[2022-12-19 16:45:03] <%titanoclock> Initiative is at least modal
[2022-12-19 16:45:07] <LoganTheBard> you can activate the spellskite, but it won't do anything
[2022-12-19 16:45:07] <disco_shark> @prodigy_j28 monarch just draws a card, initiative kills them
[2022-12-19 16:45:08] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @Prodigy_j28 No because monarch just draws a card (and at tned step) initiive does a dungeon (at upkeep)
[2022-12-19 16:45:09] <%+ROTSam> you can activate it though Kappa
[2022-12-19 16:45:10] <Dreddybajs> initiative is way more busted than monarch

[2022-12-19 16:45:38] <the_djbigslice> is adding a Basic Island too much tonplay around blood moon/fetch when you have urborg out?
[2022-12-19 16:45:51] <LoganTheBard> @yeaThatSteve you can't do that - if Acerak stays your combo never works
[2022-12-19 16:45:54] <%titanoclock> Commander cards should be commander exclusives. Ban all commander products from eternal formats
[2022-12-19 16:46:01] <kingmee> @titanoclock preach
[2022-12-19 16:46:06] <Poco_the_turtle> I'm super surprised he even kept moon in
[2022-12-19 16:46:20] <%esp_ninjabandit> If spike isn’t playing at least one copy of tarmagoyf, how could he possibly close out a game?
[2022-12-19 16:46:32] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Initive and monarch are bad because you can never answer them. Even if you destroy or exile the source the game s still about the undercity dungeon or it's still about the extra card the rest of the game.
[2022-12-19 16:46:37] <kingmee> @aspiringspike are you ready for the near 0 degree weather this week?

[2022-12-19 16:48:27] <+boostedtwitch> is this an alluren type combo?
[2022-12-19 16:48:28] <+The_Bestro203> Profane for sure, t3 you can heartless then play the guy right?
[2022-12-19 16:48:40] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> @boostedtwitch more or less
[2022-12-19 16:48:40] <+seantheautomator> @boostedtwitch yup!
[2022-12-19 16:48:49] <%titanoclock> Or they cost like 7 mana like agent
[2022-12-19 16:48:51] <+Polivyus> does blue offer more than red? We could cut mulldrifter for fury, and maybe acererak for ragavan since he's cheaper. Then we don't need heartless summoning so we can play Dauthi Voidwalker (cheap evasive beater!) and the relic probably could be cut for some removal. At this point witch's cottage offers less value, so we can trim manabase and become a blood moon deck!
[2022-12-19 16:49:02] <+boostedtwitch> thx guys

[2022-12-19 16:54:17] <bicyclops> did anyone say play myr superion for the memes yet
[2022-12-19 16:54:17] <%esp_ninjabandit> Wait… you mean it’s possible to win games with good decks using MH2 cards? How?! They are not my favorite cards so they must not be playable or good!
[2022-12-19 16:54:17] <%+ElevationAV> but we are magic players, we like to complain
[2022-12-19 16:54:20] <%+NexusVIx> @zzzzsman solitude/fury/endurance only one’s worth playing imo
[2022-12-19 16:54:20] <%titanoclock> Fire design was disbatcged at the end of 2020.
[2022-12-19 16:54:22] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> I'll get some new material when MH2 stops sucking! aspikeWhat
[2022-12-19 16:54:23] <+WestminsterN> I haven't been the biggest fan of MH2 but tbh your brewing has been slowly changing my mind haha
[2022-12-19 16:54:25] <DanroMTG> mind goblin
[2022-12-19 16:54:27] <morimondo_> I like MH cards tbh, I just can't afford a deck

[2022-12-19 16:54:41] <%enbymage> @ACEOFSPADES6442 lost mine of phandelver drains opponent, you can loop through it infinitely (bc acererak only checks having completed one of the other dungeons)
[2022-12-19 16:54:47] <smirabito> Get some new material… like how modern needs new material. As in it needs new cards. Since a lot of cards in the format are from MH. Wow Gottem
[2022-12-19 16:54:57] <+zzzzsman> @NexusVIx yep, though for the agressive blinking decks, grief is nice, and tucking a bomb is funny

[2022-12-19 16:55:23] <%titanoclock> Pre mh2 was duel deck prowess vs heliod. We wanna do that again? Lmfao
[2022-12-19 16:55:28] <Elevangeline> speaking of change, do you think Phyrexian Obliterator would be playable in Pioneer?
[2022-12-19 16:55:28] <+ging3raffe> not even to mentioon the logistical nightmare it would be to make sure ppl in the trophy race aren't using certain cards
[2022-12-19 16:55:39] <%$andrewbot5> Marsh FLats is an MH2 card lmao
[2022-12-19 16:55:42] <%+hiltinchest> eldraine lands are basically horizons cards
[2022-12-19 16:55:43] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @kynsareth Opposite, actually. Ya hear of a deck called scam? Murktide? Thanks, I'll take my answer off the air.
[2022-12-19 16:55:43] <%+dravencorvinus> the format is perfectly fine...the complaining gets so old

[2022-12-19 16:56:31] <generalbiscuits> And then MH2 arrived to save Modern
[2022-12-19 16:56:32] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @titanoclock If you don't understand how the tempo deck seals the game on turn 3 I'm not the guy to explain it to you.

[2022-12-19 17:02:26] <!%+mkdalynn> I'm just glad Neoform is gone, that deck was so annoying, it wasn't consistent enough to win a tournament, but it could just ruin yours if you ran up against it
[2022-12-19 17:02:29] <%titanoclock> Oh definitely
[2022-12-19 17:02:31] <%lucuzo54> What do you think of shredder vs iconoclast in jeskai breach?

[2022-12-19 17:04:43] <BlobfishXL> can you start a dungeon without finishing the one you are in?

[2022-12-19 17:06:24] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> KCI would be much worse right now because of Force of Vigor.
[2022-12-19 17:06:28] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> Still really good
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> And no Opal.
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <%titanoclock> I miss kci
[2022-12-19 17:06:39] <%+hiltinchest> I'm still of the opinion that 1 engineer is better than the 3rd breach, especially with research desk in the maindeck
[2022-12-19 17:06:40] <%titanoclock> Kci was banned because of opal
[2022-12-19 17:06:41] <brukidm> MeninoNey

[2022-12-19 17:06:58] <%+revenge_of_the_seth> KCI could not beat burn
[2022-12-19 17:06:58] <%HugHeist> opal definitely should've got banned instead of kcu
[2022-12-19 17:07:02] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Save clicks, PLay this deck with rooftop storm. And, since you're already in rooftop storm, play gravecraweler. And since you're already in gravecrawler and Ace Wayward servant and Undead augur. You'll need a sac outlet then. Thankfully you have Carrion Feeder. I think there's something here...

[2022-12-19 17:07:26] <%Prodigy_j28> I don’t understand why they changed the rules only for cascading into valki. You can still bring to light valki.
[2022-12-19 17:07:41] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> But Utter-Leyton just crushed everyone on Dimir Shadow at PT25.
[2022-12-19 17:07:41] <alittlecheeky> sometimes you don't see living end for a while and you're reminded how good the deck is
[2022-12-19 17:07:42] <donaldisaduck> @aspiringspike  KCI was miserable to play in any tournament unless  your name was matt nass
[2022-12-19 17:07:53] <%shadowpopo2> have you tried an intruder alarm version of this deck in sultai?
[2022-12-19 17:08:03] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> @Prodigy_j28 Because Cascade is a series of cards and BTL is one card
[2022-12-19 17:08:22] <%+Miachon> @aspiringspike what about splash for red and play pyro?
[2022-12-19 17:08:41] <rThundrbolt> i think gwenna version is fine in pioneer though
