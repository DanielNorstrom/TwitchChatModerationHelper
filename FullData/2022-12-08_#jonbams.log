We just got an email from accounting indicating we have to make a 10 percent increase to all prices by janruary 1st to counter act inflation.  My manager is all pissed, claiming its because people are demanding higher pay and the costs are being passed to the consumer.  She is fearful that once the prices are raised you never reduce them so when things calm down we have created a huge problem What are your thoughts oh wise 1

[2022-12-08 18:38:35] <%$Mackapoot> Time on that specific instrument has a better value. 1000 hours on a cheap violin is better than 100 hours on an expensive one.

[2022-12-08 19:33:09] <!%erebus56> you pay a delivery fee for pizza too
[2022-12-08 19:33:11] <%KRAM941> Ya, and I paid a delivery fee when ordering pizza...
[2022-12-08 19:33:11] <!%4tw0ne> Tipping needs to be "reworked" in america
[2022-12-08 19:33:13] <!%erebus56> at least around here
[2022-12-08 19:33:13] <%qtiwolf> Tipping culture is fucking wild
[2022-12-08 19:33:15] <+Vandallite> you pay for delivery on food too

[2022-12-08 19:33:23] <+Erumite> And of course Amazon will take a portion of the tip for handling.
[2022-12-08 19:33:23] <IHaveShirts> @JonBams i've been delivering with them for 7 years i deliver with my own vehicle
[2022-12-08 19:33:27] <!%erebus56> they can fuck themself
[2022-12-08 19:33:29] <%+topsecret_iii> There is no such thing as a living wage!
[2022-12-08 19:33:41] <SixFootTurkey_> reminder to never ever tip digitally
[2022-12-08 19:33:44] <%+icecracker19> you order the pizza and it is there in an hour. you pay shipping for something that might be there in a couple of days.
[2022-12-08 19:33:46] <+Trashorama> I'm sure the tip will also have a "processing fee" from amazon.
[2022-12-08 19:33:46] <%CosFrog> You say Alexa thank my driver and amazon gives them $5 no charge to you
[2022-12-08 19:33:48] <!%erebus56> weird, you live in the EU?

[2022-12-08 19:33:55] <froginator45> You should never have to pay a tip. A tip should only be for over-the-top service.
[2022-12-08 19:33:57] <IHaveShirts> @Erumite i was part of the class action lawsuit against amazon where they were taking our tips
[2022-12-08 19:33:58] <!%erebus56> i hate tipping culture
[2022-12-08 19:33:58] <!%+Kayjaxx> You don't pay anything extra. Amazon pays it. You can just tell Alexa to tip your delivery driver.
[2022-12-08 19:34:01] <%KRAM941> i did that until the delivery guy flipped out... @JonBams
[2022-12-08 19:34:02] <%$SulakAlNanna> tipping culture is broken, even funnier is those Amazon prime drivers are 3rd party so the odds of them actually getting that tip instead of the contracting company.. we'll see how that works out
[2022-12-08 19:34:02] <%PrimeBlackDodo> I never tip through the pay, I pay the guy/gal when they show up
[2022-12-08 19:34:05] <%degisikbiriii> there are absolutely a lot of people who are going to tip on holidays because they feel bad
[2022-12-08 19:34:10] <%TMMOOF> They started asking for card tips at my Starbucks
[2022-12-08 19:34:14] <+luck429> @JonBams when is the next world tour
[2022-12-08 19:34:17] <%DeezNuts_> or higher amount to give to drivers on items over a certain weight
[2022-12-08 19:34:30] <+Vandallite> wow
[2022-12-08 19:34:50] <%$redghost29> get rid of tipping

[2022-12-08 19:34:53] <%+jkole0711> but if you make below minimum wage after tips, the company has to make up the difference
[2022-12-08 19:34:56] <%$Rodimus_Supreme> And yet they'll then take those tips and distribute them amongst everyone like the fucking communists they are.
