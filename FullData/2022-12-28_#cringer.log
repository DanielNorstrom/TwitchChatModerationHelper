[2022-12-28 14:17:46] <$CapnSlipp> Does the DC universe have anything like Marvel universe where each retelling of a story is just given a different universe number?
[2022-12-28 14:18:20] <$CapnSlipp> I mean, I think Marvel messed it up for the MCU — it uses the same universe number as the comics or something — but still.
[2022-12-28 14:18:22] <%xReadyAimMissx> The only Batman movies I really liked are the ones staring Michael Keaton. LUL Oh and the Dark Knight one with Heath Ledger.

[2022-12-28 14:21:26] <%trivialmind> The MCU has had commercial success and are largely in the same timeline. I have to imagine the DC folks would like some of that commercial success.

[2022-12-28 14:22:26] <%+MtMan> I feel like DC never let anything organically grow. Like MCU had just a stinger at the end of Iron Man. DC in Batman vs Superman had a little trailer time in the middle where they show off aquaman and the flash.

[2022-12-28 14:23:24] <DarkDruidSS> Bloodhaven is also right by Gotham
[2022-12-28 14:23:31] <%trivialmind> The MCU stuff references actual New York city, right?
[2022-12-28 14:23:39] <%thirtyeight50> When I was growing up Marvel was always a better read than most DC Comics.  Same pattern follows with the movies.

[2022-12-28 14:24:26] <$CapnSlipp> @trivialmind Yup.  In Marvel comics, it’s NYC (though a modified version compared to reality with additions like the Stark building and Baxter building).
[2022-12-28 14:24:52] <%thirtyeight50> Ryan Reynolds didnt sell you on that LUL
[2022-12-28 14:25:00] <+godawfulgaming> batman is my favorite but the recent issue of him surviving a fall from space is just too much

[2022-12-28 14:25:06] <Nywro> Hellblazer was my main comic of choice when younger.

[2022-12-28 14:25:15] <+ArtemiiaOfAzeroth> I loved green lantern growing up, but got so much crap for it once the movies came out
[2022-12-28 14:25:20] <%trivialmind> Writing? Budget?

[2022-12-28 14:26:17] <%LavatoryLoad> Have you watched the Willow series? Super sad face.  It's like watching a high school musical =(   I had to turn it off it was so bad.
[2022-12-28 14:26:19] <VilneeusSchoolmaster> The world wasn't ready for an emo/pissed off Superman.  They should have made him "fun" first and then have something happen to make him question saving humanity
[2022-12-28 14:26:54] <%xReadyAimMissx> Willow isn't terrible. I think it's ok so far.
[2022-12-28 14:26:57] <%LavatoryLoad> My wife and I were so amped up to watch it and I wanted to vomit.

[2022-12-28 14:27:04] <%+MtMan> emo/pissed off doesnt describe superman
[2022-12-28 14:27:06] <%trivialmind> For me watching streams of Marvel Snap and to a lesser extent Marvel's Midnight Suns has had me looking up a ton of lesser known characters that come from alternate timelines and universes.
[2022-12-28 14:27:10] <+ArtemiiaOfAzeroth> More Dark Horse stuff would be nice to see produced as well. Hellboy movies weren't bad at all.
[2022-12-28 14:27:22] <+TooTired2Care> DC is absolute garbage though
[2022-12-28 14:27:25] <+bigandfetty> wasnt superman taking part in humanity enough for him to question humanity?
[2022-12-28 14:27:33] <+bigandfetty> p sure it was...
[2022-12-28 14:27:42] <$CapnSlipp> Willow is… not great.  But then again, the original movie was very campy (the Brownies with horrible maybe-racist fake French accents were particularly bad).  So I’m enjoying Willow as much as any other kids cartoon on Disney+.
[2022-12-28 14:27:42] <%thirtyeight50> Lobo!

[2022-12-28 14:28:27] <%LavatoryLoad> Consistency and continuity are two words that come to mind that are NOT congruent with DC.
[2022-12-28 14:28:41] <Mionio> I cant get over the power differences. Superman is just dumb

[2022-12-28 14:28:53] <+TooTired2Care> if DC ever made a series like Marvel did. DC would never be able to implement Wonderwomen, Superman, or batman. They would literally ruin any story for be absurdly broken of a character
[2022-12-28 14:29:00] <DarkDruidSS> Flash would be cool if they could do it right

[2022-12-28 14:29:59] <DarkDruidSS> Flash TV show was like Dragonball Z. The big bad is always more powerful than him lol.
[2022-12-28 14:29:59] <Rhane__> I am not fast enough…. Sad face. Cue credits
[2022-12-28 14:30:26] <%trivialmind> As a very casual follower of comics I find it occasionally difficult to work out the relative power levels. "Can X take a punch from Y?"
[2022-12-28 14:30:27] <+bigandfetty> it was too CW
[2022-12-28 14:30:34] <CalmFrantix> I always thought other 'hero's were just crappy compared to the power of superman. I know he was meant to be the ideal man etc. but Alan Moore's Dr. Manhattan felt like a great angle for a super powerful being. One that struggles to really care
[2022-12-28 14:30:41] <+godawfulgaming> arrows first 2 seasons where amazing
[2022-12-28 14:30:43] <+TooTired2Care> @DarkDruidSS right, it can never be that the bad guy is just slightly faster or smarter. Just gotta be an overall power house stronger
[2022-12-28 14:30:53] <+bigandfetty> when arrow stopped killing arrow got lame lol
[2022-12-28 14:30:55] <%$k_nord> yea, the Flash and Green Arrow TV became teenagedrama with gownups. very off putting
[2022-12-28 14:30:58] <Nywro> Almost like it all doesn't have to be directed at just one audience demographic.

[2022-12-28 14:32:06] <+TooTired2Care> @thirtyeight50 agreed, Daredevil is really good. I absolutely hated Iron Fist though. god was it bad.

[2022-12-28 14:32:31] <+bigandfetty> the broadway boys episode was epic what you mean
[2022-12-28 14:32:37] <+TooTired2Care> it was so fucking cringe, like I couldn't
[2022-12-28 14:32:49] <DarkDruidSS> Ironfist could have been better, but i still enjoyed most of it
[2022-12-28 14:32:52] <%Vriggchan> @NotThatBright lol, sry not really a superhero fan so havent really seen any of them
[2022-12-28 14:32:58] <+tracer8881> luke cage was my jam

[2022-12-28 14:33:09] <%xReadyAimMissx> @thirtyeight50 well @thirtyeight50 you are at least getting the show back. hopefully we'll see him in his own movie too.
[2022-12-28 14:33:19] <%trivialmind> Do you think Iron Fist would have been better if they had retconned the main character to actually be from an asian ethnicity?
[2022-12-28 14:33:21] <%$k_nord> Luke Cage 1st season was great
[2022-12-28 14:33:22] <+godawfulgaming> when they killed cottonmouth i was done with luke cage

[2022-12-28 14:34:22] <+TooTired2Care> @xReadyAimMissx why would people say not to watch Luke Cage? He was one of the best of the 4 TV shows
[2022-12-28 14:34:33] <+TooTired2Care> @trivialmind RIGHT, good god, I need her to be my wife
[2022-12-28 14:34:52] <%xReadyAimMissx> @xReadyAimMissx they told me that the show was terrible. LUL like so many people said that, I was surprised. KEKW

[2022-12-28 14:35:13] <DarkDruidSS> Jon Bernthal as Punisher was fantastic too i thought
[2022-12-28 14:35:19] <+TooTired2Care> @xReadyAimMissx that's crazy
[2022-12-28 14:35:22] <%xReadyAimMissx> Yeah Punisher was good too.
[2022-12-28 14:35:36] <+TooTired2Care> @DarkDruidSS forreal!, no other person could replace him as The Punisher
[2022-12-28 14:35:43] <%R3voked> Punisher was great yea :D

[2022-12-28 14:36:34] <%R3voked> Im kinda hooked on Person of Interest atm. Its cheaply done in ways, but decent story arcs etc
[2022-12-28 14:36:42] <+godawfulgaming> it looked like they were building to heroes for hire or daughters of the dragon but nothing ever came of it
[2022-12-28 14:36:55] <%+MtMan> I liked person of interest

[2022-12-28 14:38:15] <%trivialmind> It's the '80s! Medical grade cocaine for everyone!

[2022-12-28 14:38:59] <%R3voked> Ah :O
[2022-12-28 14:39:05] <+TooTired2Care> Jessica Jones just felt like someone that was always stuck in some version of StockHolm syndrome?
[2022-12-28 14:39:16] <%xReadyAimMissx> yup, watching them this way makes the shows make more sense.
[2022-12-28 14:39:22] <DarkDruidSS> they were all part of The Defenders right?
[2022-12-28 14:39:38] <%xReadyAimMissx> @DarkDruidSS yeah
[2022-12-28 14:39:42] <%R3voked> @xReadyAimMissx Smart then cringeOoh
[2022-12-28 14:39:48] <%trivialmind> Jessica Jones seems to be a much darker version of the super story. Closer to The Boys.

[2022-12-28 14:58:03] <%cubion> i had fun on that server did not have any big problems with anyone
[2022-12-28 14:58:14] <+DoktorNik> Eco is an interesting game concept, but in execution it has some 20 unfun mechanics for every 5 novel mechanics for every 1 fun mechanics
[2022-12-28 14:58:21] <The_Sp1d3r> Mushrooms never go as far as I expect them to.
[2022-12-28 14:59:13] <%+sammiewich> That stuff pisses me off. Just enjoy that someone is taking time out of their day to do this FOR YOU.
[2022-12-28 14:59:36] <+ArtemiiaOfAzeroth> I went through that with my ARK server. Never any issues, but I had two players with more drama then common sense and it ruined the whole experience for me.

[2022-12-28 15:01:01] <+Fressure> Lol the burnout was real
[2022-12-28 15:01:18] <DarkDruidSS> people try to make real world life issues a thing in Eco

[2022-12-28 15:01:50] <%+jeecktoo> True, but still, it’s a video game LUL you ain’t wrong though
[2022-12-28 15:01:51] <%xReadyAimMissx> @DoktorNik well, technically it wasn't intended to be a full blown game. it originally was just meant to be a teaching tool for like elementary school kids. LUL a lot has changed in a short time after all the Late Shift Eco RP streams bringing them so much more attention. lol

[2022-12-28 15:06:14] <DarkDruidSS> it wouldn't even have to be like a serious threat... like Minecraft level. Wolves and naturally aggressive animals should do more than just walk around to be killed. it's just very meh... like being a butcher is the easiest thing in Eco. just run around killing everything.
[2022-12-28 15:06:55] <%LavatoryLoad> @DarkDruidSS Food spoils now.  The churn is much more intense since you can't just horde food and farmers/cooks can't just infinitely stock.  Also,, food "likes" is different for every player now.  So cooks have to make everything - not just sausage and topped P.  It helps keep the economy flowing.
[2022-12-28 15:06:56] <DarkDruidSS> i know it's just my opinion, that's all
