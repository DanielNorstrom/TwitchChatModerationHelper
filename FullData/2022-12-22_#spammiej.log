Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2022-12-22 17:13:32] <%Zeemuis> rulebook does not even mention 'ace' so maybe it will change
[2022-12-22 17:13:36] <FastMaarten11> So they basically want finalist mode for map wins?

[2022-12-22 17:15:15] <elefantsnot> A win should be 10 points and then an ace. Like finalist mode
[2022-12-22 17:15:20] <+re_horizon> in soccer for example you only get point for draw of win, and here you get a point for some losses

[2022-12-22 17:16:03] <RotakeR> @re_horizon You can lose 2nd leg in Champions League and still win the whole match
[2022-12-22 17:16:06] <%Yar2000> at least the system isnt as confusing for new viewers as the last one with the point multipliers and losing points and stuff
[2022-12-22 17:16:13] <iwVerve> I think finalist mode has been one of the least controversial aspects of TM comps? I don't think people would be opposed to it existing here as well
[2022-12-22 17:16:19] <%+WonarioStrike> maybe same rules but you can only win a match with a victory/draw. Meaning you are not 100% the winner with 10 points
[2022-12-22 17:16:25] <%$ThePlatypusOne> so an ace would be 2-0 then
[2022-12-22 17:16:38] <johnara2002> catJAM
[2022-12-22 17:16:42] <%$ThePlatypusOne> if we go with this logic
[2022-12-22 17:16:45] <%jethrobaggins> dosnt it happen in f1  team wins championship olike 3 race before end
[2022-12-22 17:16:47] <+SantaTim> I think the point system is alright but if you reach 10 points then it's finalist mode
[2022-12-22 17:16:49] <tuttifrutti45> then why not make it like in football, for example you drive 5 rounds per map and whoever gets the most points in these 5 rounds the better team wins the map. if its a tie you at that point you just drive 1 more round

[2022-12-22 17:17:05] <TorThicc_> Also definitely not everyone practiced so it was a lot easier to get Aces last weekend depending on the matchup
[2022-12-22 17:17:08] <%pidesquare> did we pump the mime map?
[2022-12-22 17:17:08] <%Yar2000> yes @jethrobaggins but F1 also doesnt have potentially infinite races to settle a finalist mode
[2022-12-22 17:17:22] VIEWERS: 884
[2022-12-22 17:17:27] <16piby9> dont need finalist mode, but Aces are waay too powerfull imo
[2022-12-22 17:17:27] <%Ultar1on> At this point you should just make a FormatChatting emote xdd
[2022-12-22 17:17:29] <FastMaarten11> But 2 - 0 doesn't scale right with the 1 - 1 and 2 - 1
[2022-12-22 17:17:29] <Barazep> they could leave the ace at 3 but increase the points needed for win (e.g. first to 15)
[2022-12-22 17:17:30] <jadedvirtuoso> finalist mode is basically what you want though when you want a victory for point 10
[2022-12-22 17:17:47] <16piby9> @FastMaarten11 why not?
[2022-12-22 17:17:58] <@%keby> tbh i dont think it would change much, the better team would prolly win in both cases anyway
[2022-12-22 17:18:06] <bbbbatu> 2-0 1-0 1-1
[2022-12-22 17:18:16] <+TaktyKK> ok, but why do we even need the "10 points" instead of going for exact number of rounds
[2022-12-22 17:18:38] <%jethrobaggins> @Yar2000 i meant for winning wehn it say victory for other team

[2022-12-22 17:19:07] <iwVerve> The way I think of aces is that if they're too strong, it almost becomes "which team gets more aces", with everything else just being a tiebraker. Like the difference between a win and draw is really small compared to between win and ace
[2022-12-22 17:19:14] <Ajemik> The confusing part is why Ace gives 3 points. Should be 2:0 either 4:0 (both players beat both players) - but that's too much, so what's left is 2:0 which seems unfair because it's  still beating both players, but twice (by both from the team). But then, why award one point to the loser team when one is beaten, as in normal rounds?

[2022-12-22 17:20:10] <%Yar2000> @jethrobaggins yeah of course, but in F1 if a team is e.g. 150 points ahead with 3 races left they cant be overtaken anymore, so having to close it on a win would be pointless because there arent infinite rounds for others to catch up to their points if you understand what I mean essaying

[2022-12-22 18:00:40] <@%^StreamElements> Back at it again with some 'Track of the Day' author hunting. Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2022-12-22 18:34:59] <%Maverick13589> xpp
[2022-12-22 18:35:00] <RotakeR> 3 victories = 1 ace. Imagine that in old CPS days in 2v2. It's too much imo
[2022-12-22 18:35:00] <+mennonate> aces are going to create some really epic comebacks, and will deliver the most memorable moments imo
[2022-12-22 18:35:01] <%tarpor_> Hmmm
[2022-12-22 18:35:01] <%dazzzyy___> Hmmm
[2022-12-22 18:35:15] <@%^StreamElements> • Be respectful • Use common sense • Don't ask when other streamers go live in my chat • Don't try to stir random drama • Any violation will results in a purge/time out •
[2022-12-22 18:35:25] <%KlipsEffigy> the only diff between ace and win is 2nd and 3rd exchanging places
[2022-12-22 18:35:26] <@%CarlJrtm> yeah, preparation is different depending on the map
[2022-12-22 18:35:26] <%Zeemuis> @Kriidy Shirley I can get to master
[2022-12-22 18:35:42] <%Kriidy> @carljrtm I assume it helps that maps arent introducued after every step? changes the mindset throughout? or not?

[2022-12-22 18:35:46] <@%CarlJrtm> we'll get aced on our worst map and we'll ace on our best map i think
[2022-12-22 18:35:47] <%KlipsEffigy> i don't think aces are very unlikely at all

[2022-12-22 18:36:14] <nopey____> you ban the map you dont train
[2022-12-22 18:36:16] <@%CarlJrtm> than my second worst
[2022-12-22 18:36:19] <+IamPd> @Kriidy master makes sense since the last campaign maps only get unlocked at gold
[2022-12-22 18:36:21] <@%CarlJrtm> then*
[2022-12-22 18:36:28] <%KlipsEffigy> after banning a map there is still A worst map lol

[2022-12-22 18:36:47] <@%CarlJrtm> i had a sick map where i aced all the rounds, than mime aced everything back

[2022-12-22 18:36:55] <@%CarlJrtm> 2 years ago same thing, than Pac aced his maps
[2022-12-22 18:36:56] <aunvilgo> But if everybody practices offline, nobody knows to really tell how good they are on any map

[2022-12-22 18:37:26] <%tarpor_> ye you have a point carl but now you need 2 players to be better than the other 2 on a map, instead of just a single player being the best

[2022-12-22 18:38:01] <@%CarlJrtm> yeah but since you train together, you get a close level with your teammate
[2022-12-22 18:38:02] <+Woodeater98> @carljrtm but maybe you are missing a strat, and suddenly you get aced on a map you thought you were good on
[2022-12-22 18:38:07] <Viiruu> i hope i dont end up div 1 and get shittered and instead end up like div 2 and chill
[2022-12-22 18:38:12] <%+Baashard> Tarpor the notulist
[2022-12-22 18:38:14] <+FK_Jape6> one ace is effectively worth 3 wins while they're (if it were random) just as likely
[2022-12-22 18:38:20] <%TimBeaTs> triangD
[2022-12-22 18:38:29] <@%CarlJrtm> @Woodeater98 then its the same problem about aces hahaha
[2022-12-22 18:38:33] <+mennonate> @carljrtm I think you are correct about the frequency of aces. I wonder what the correct strategic play is, full risk to go for aces or try and prevent aces?
[2022-12-22 18:38:40] <%dazzzyy___> bwoah
[2022-12-22 18:38:41] <jojomaking> i quite like this debate because we will get to see who was right when tournie starts :)

[2022-12-22 18:39:07] <%tarpor_> carl gonna throw on purpose to get aced and then say he was right
[2022-12-22 18:39:09] <Iceman___S> it boils down to aces being disproportionately good compared to regular wins
[2022-12-22 18:39:10] <prechoo> Will aces be common in TMWL maps though
[2022-12-22 18:39:17] <prechoo> those were easy campaign maps
[2022-12-22 18:39:17] <@%^StreamElements> COPIUM
[2022-12-22 18:39:29] <croustibapti> also i think first week we will have a lot of ace but at a point everybody would have other's lines
[2022-12-22 18:39:29] <%tarpor_> that's what we're discussing prechoo xdd
[2022-12-22 18:39:39] <+IamPd> @Woodeater98 it's way less likely to miss something big with 2 people. You can compare your approach/lines/pace on every sector

[2022-12-22 18:40:04] <%+pierisensei> but since the mappack is the same throughout one stage, strats are going to be relevant first 2 steps most likely. After that lines are going to be leaked
[2022-12-22 18:40:11] <chillhase> NOP
[2022-12-22 18:40:25] <%Maverick13589> could the format be tweaked between Stage 1 and Stage 2 eventually? interviewen

[2022-12-22 18:41:00] <+IamPd> @pierisensei if you have the lines before you can train them for weeks, instead of having to switch one matchday to the next
[2022-12-22 18:41:00] <%Kriidy> @maverick13589 Well, clearly softy's response leaves that door open
[2022-12-22 18:41:09] <%AgentWhlskey> @prechoo ? mappack is already known

The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2022-12-22 19:18:10] <s7ickyy> I think players of all skill levels can enjoy this map, for a generous definition of "enjoy" and "all skill levels", and also for "players" because watching a streamer make it to the end at good pace only to hit the top of the fin is peak entertainment, much to be preferred to playing it yourself in cotd. :D

[2022-12-22 19:48:26] <%indy91> as long as the training and seasonal campaigns are beginner friendly it's all good to me
[2022-12-22 19:48:27] <%dazzzyy___> there's a difference between hard and finishable map and this map right here imo

[2022-12-22 19:48:30] <%KlipsEffigy> like, you took 8 mins to get 1 finish, probably a bunch of people couldn't even finish which is pretty brutal
[2022-12-22 19:48:30] <JunaZard_> if it's like free cup of the day like cupra yes I think it should be beginer friendly map
[2022-12-22 19:48:35] <%Loftwingz> only free cotd maps should be imo

[2022-12-22 19:48:55] <johnara2002> even then they will find a reaason to cry
[2022-12-22 19:48:56] <par_h3lion> CotD is the reason casual players play the game ... it's in nadeo's interest to pick maps that anyone can finish without too much struggle
[2022-12-22 19:49:00] <CrerisRs> @Loftwingz Surely everyone that paid 10€ for the game is not beginner
[2022-12-22 19:49:02] <tRaphl> good players also complain if gears are miscalculated or somtehing else beacause mapper isnt  good enough
[2022-12-22 19:49:04] <yxhuvud> TOTD purpose is not to be beginner friendly, it is to showcase great maps. Then cotd plays a tournie on the same map every day.
[2022-12-22 19:49:09] <@%MASSA> stop watching keyboard

[2022-12-22 19:49:18] <enderxdd_> missed the finish
[2022-12-22 19:49:19] <tricko_43> but again people complain if the maps are too easy

[2022-12-22 19:49:27] <+mr_roddi> you can bring difficult tracks, as long as the difficult part is not a speed check that's too hard too pass for beginners. I dont mind bonking because im too bad
[2022-12-22 19:49:32] <mikeyiwnl> tallie Sadge
[2022-12-22 19:49:35] <%KlipsEffigy> yeah tbh COTD isn't beginner friendly anyways so I don't really mind
[2022-12-22 19:49:36] <meatvroom> theres never an issue of beginner friendliness its an issue of less skilled players being upset that they cant drive a map perfect
[2022-12-22 19:49:49] <%vlees> well, 400 people less than usual qualified, so 400 people failed to reach the finish line in 10 minutes I guess

[2022-12-22 19:49:55] <mellowfellow808> another argument is that a map is not suitable for rounds, more to ta
[2022-12-22 19:49:57] <%KlipsEffigy> I think what they mean tho is rather that the map is driveable; as in: you can consistently finish it and mistakes don't instantly kill you
[2022-12-22 19:50:00] <%Yar2000> If you can finish a map by going slow, its beginner friendly. The rest is just skill issue if you cant go faster
[2022-12-22 19:50:00] <%pidesquare> people just want to press the gas button and have giant wide turns... beginners will slow down and actually release the gas, which is good
[2022-12-22 19:50:00] <MonotoneCulprit> Anything with speed checks or skill checks brings out the beginner friendly debate. Even if you can still finish it as a beginner.
[2022-12-22 19:50:01] <RyuuganjiTM> should just be finishable, so if all cp's are standing respawnable it's fine

[2022-12-22 19:50:02] <%Cifer524> is he arguing about it because his map tomorrow also not beginnah friendly? Aware
[2022-12-22 19:50:02] <+ponteslucass> ice maps r definetly not beginner for COTD,  but again, that argument only make sense for free COTD  weekend
[2022-12-22 19:50:03] <+Cstik> does literally every single day have to be beginner friendly? there's a cup every day just skip one or two jfc
[2022-12-22 19:50:04] <@%MASSA> spam switch player please
[2022-12-22 19:50:05] <TomsenTm> they should all be beginner friendly tho, you can have those kinda maps while still making them fun to hunt and play
[2022-12-22 19:50:05] <%+GrdAlf> respawns we're pretty good on this map
[2022-12-22 19:50:12] <tricko_43> i means today's map is really good
[2022-12-22 19:50:13] <%+MIQQA> as a mapper, I just wish there was a modicum of consistency in the selections and rulings

[2022-12-22 19:50:16] <%+B3N30> campaign is beginner, COTD is for advanced and pro players
[2022-12-22 19:50:17] <%$sharkmano3> The entire point of the divisions is to put people with those of their skill level. If they suck, they will be matched with others who also suck (and maybe Hobbit), so I don’t see an issue
[2022-12-22 19:50:17] <meloa> honestly you could probably win my div on this track with a double respawn every checkpoint
[2022-12-22 19:50:19] <enderxdd_> XDDDD
[2022-12-22 19:50:20] <+Burrit0> well every day the same discussion. so what if a map is hard and i suck at it? then i need to get better or drive easier tracks (for example campaign)

[2022-12-22 19:50:52] <CorgiLoafer> maybe a good compromise would be having the harder totd's on a certain day of the week
[2022-12-22 19:50:59] <%Mathyper59> PLAY tomorrow then
[2022-12-22 19:51:04] <+Burrit0> @dudemahhn maybe u are just bad

[2022-12-22 19:51:05] <%dazzzyy___> I can see why this map gets shit on tho, you can fly out anywhere if you do a tiny mistake
[2022-12-22 19:51:05] <%speq__> brother if u cant get a clean run after an hour maybe its not the map
[2022-12-22 19:51:05] <par_h3lion> a good mapper knows how to make the track beginner friendly :) and respawns with boosters is not the way btw
[2022-12-22 19:51:11] <%staring_at_infinity> @dudemahhn skill issue
[2022-12-22 19:51:13] <%Yar2000> Any map is fine if you can finish it by going slow imo, the only things that are not beginner friendly is a speedcheck
[2022-12-22 19:51:13] <%KlipsEffigy> personally I would like TOTD maps to have something like a normal/hard/expert tag, to help set expectations + allow players to better plan which TOTD they want to participate in
[2022-12-22 19:51:14] <meloa> is that not what divisions are for though, to put you against beginners, its not like it really changes much
[2022-12-22 19:51:15] <%vlees> @meatvroom there's 400 less players qualified for a div than yesterday; maybe 400 people wanted to play, but couldn't finish in 10 minutes
[2022-12-22 19:51:16] <RyuuganjiTM> @CorgiLoafer french monday
[2022-12-22 19:51:17] <%pidesquare> just go slower guys... its ok to release the gas :)

[2022-12-22 19:51:18] <MonotoneCulprit> There's a COTD every day, if the map isn't for you literally just wait 24 hours and try again
[2022-12-22 19:51:19] <@%keby> lmfao this reddit comment "I don't know what's going on, but somehow it's Massa's fault"
[2022-12-22 19:51:21] <FoXsTeRDOTA> @dudemahhn You can't even say that, because you can play for multiple hours and bonk because you're pushing it to the limit.
[2022-12-22 19:51:28] <elefantsnot> Having to hunt a map for an hour to get a clean run is a fun challenge in it self. That's when you skip the COTD, and hunt the map instead
[2022-12-22 19:51:29] <%speq__> keby xdd
[2022-12-22 19:51:29] <deidera1612> i think it is fine if its hard to drive fast, but if its hard to finish its no good for rounds..
[2022-12-22 19:51:29] <%+B3N30> COTD should be all kind of maps. It's a showcase of what mappers can do. Why should it only be limited to easy maps. Who made this rule?

[2022-12-22 19:53:04] <FoXsTeRDOTA> People just want to complain as per usual
[2022-12-22 19:53:05] <%TheNewManInYourLife> Beginner friendly map with a difficult AT is a nice balance
[2022-12-22 19:53:06] <$Hatchet302> a bunch of entitled crybabies, really
[2022-12-22 19:53:06] <@%JoranWitte> that is why we have gold medal times :)

[2022-12-22 19:53:13] <%alexS_> the first problem with that is that campaign ATs are free af so they want that everywhere imo

[2022-12-22 19:53:14] <@%^StreamElements> COPIUM
[2022-12-22 19:53:15] <%indy91> the metric is probably how often you even can finish the map, not necessarily how fast
[2022-12-22 19:53:16] <VforRevenge> if you have 9 ko's oin like div 4 thats not fun
[2022-12-22 19:53:20] <%Sccotty> not console friendly either xdd
[2022-12-22 19:53:20] <%+xpRugger> They should just hide ATs again

[2022-12-22 19:54:12] <iwVerve> I think there's an unfortunate position where a daily track is this important, like yeah if you're new and excited for cotd and just get skill checked it sucks, but I wouldn't want to leave trickier tracks out of cotd entirely either
[2022-12-22 19:54:12] <%DarthSlothMD> As a game publisher, you would like to play as many people as possible, not to have mode only for top 1% players. AT medals are different story

[2022-12-22 19:54:52] <%pidesquare> i think we need to re-frame, "beginner friendly" to "beginner finishable". Fuck everything being friendly, sometimes its ok for the map to be WAYTOODANK and more suited to high-skill players. as long as beginners can respawn safely and finish then its good enough

[2022-12-22 19:58:23] <%Artuvo> @Spammiej What I actually think is that a map is beginner friendly if you can take multiple lines (so you can make mistakes). On maps like this there is almost 1 line you need to do otherwise you have to respawn.

[2022-12-22 20:00:38] <saghzs> i think when you run through DS4 the game detects the DS4 but also still the default, so you have 2 controllers connected, and can change keybinds individually, leading to double binds.

[2022-12-22 20:05:45] <%HeyImBode> but menus worked xdd
[2022-12-22 20:05:49] <+forever_sl> on a ds4 v2
[2022-12-22 20:05:57] <enderxdd_> ok but i cant bind the dpad
[2022-12-22 20:05:58] <+forever_sl> cuz v1 isnt supported
[2022-12-22 20:06:06] <enderxdd_> its strange though
[2022-12-22 20:06:08] <+forever_sl> @enderxdd_ yeah thats the point xdd
[2022-12-22 20:06:13] <enderxdd_> that u can use it to navigate menus but not to drive
[2022-12-22 20:06:14] <enderxdd_> xdd
[2022-12-22 20:06:15] <+forever_sl> so they didnt fix anything
[2022-12-22 20:06:17] <nicheslime> This map looks hard af but also so cool
[2022-12-22 20:06:17] <%HeyImBode> these bobsleigh blocks are full custom right ?
[2022-12-22 20:06:22] <Rising_tv> on steam you got  program called controller compagnion to connect easier with a PS controller maybe that's something?

[2022-12-22 20:06:31] <%dazzzyy___> pros and they keybinds
[2022-12-22 20:06:39] <%Yar2000> @KStu82 idk, I think I was using the one that was unbound
[2022-12-22 20:07:16] <nicheslime> What was the original controller issue? I missed it
[2022-12-22 20:07:24] <%HeyImBode> this bob block looks so chaotic xpp
[2022-12-22 20:07:37] <@%Kem_> > Fix an issue with binding the menu button on a gamepad. i wonder if that's somehow related xpp

[2022-12-22 20:08:28] <enderxdd_> ppL
[2022-12-22 20:08:30] <@%Kem_> also gamepad editor was heavily worked on for this release cycle, so maybe some input detection changes have been made, but not noted donw
[2022-12-22 20:08:47] <%Yar2000> gamepad editor sounds like the most annoying thing to use ever xdd
[2022-12-22 20:08:56] <GlizdaTV> any one know does native support include ds3? I wonder if I could make my setup work under windows
[2022-12-22 20:08:57] <@%Kem_> nah, it's fine @Yar2000
[2022-12-22 20:09:02] <@%Kem_> give it a try Yepge
[2022-12-22 20:09:08] <%tarpor_> RMC record gonna be broken when the 14 year old playstation kids gonna make maps in gamepad editor
[2022-12-22 20:09:09] <%Yar2000> @Kem_ how does the block selecting work?
[2022-12-22 20:09:20] <@%Kem_> thumbsticks
[2022-12-22 20:09:37] <@%Kem_> for expert mode at least
[2022-12-22 20:09:55] <%Yar2000> I have a DS3 hidden away somewhere but no idea where xdd
[2022-12-22 20:09:56] <+forever_sl> I have a ds3 laying around but it doesnt have native support
[2022-12-22 20:10:01] <DodecahedralTM> I used to play with DS3, but not native support
[2022-12-22 20:10:06] <+forever_sl> i used an external software for TM2 and TM2020 is essentially TM2 anyways
[2022-12-22 20:10:08] <Viiruu> @tarpor_ can they even upload to tmx
[2022-12-22 20:10:09] <@%Kem_> like with one stick you select type, then another stick selects the block, and with triggers you switch pages if there are any
[2022-12-22 20:10:12] <+forever_sl> scpserver i think
[2022-12-22 20:10:16] <+forever_sl> or something like this
[2022-12-22 20:10:19] <@%Kem_> maybe spam wants to demo it on stream? peepoShy

[2022-12-22 20:10:40] <nopey____> i wish nadeo would add names to the mnk editor instead of just numbers ReallyMad
[2022-12-22 20:11:08] <%Yar2000> It sounds decent if you get used to it tbh
[2022-12-22 20:11:29] <%tarpor_> @tarpor_ oh ye, dunno Aware
[2022-12-22 20:11:30] <%pidesquare> Imagine trying to freeblock in gamepad editor
[2022-12-22 20:11:30] <$Hatchet302> why would they need to be marked?
[2022-12-22 20:11:40] <GlizdaTV> @forever_sl so I'll stay out of windows for know as I don't want to use scp toolkit until it will be supported again
[2022-12-22 20:11:40] <@%Kem_> idk, it prolly takes a while to get used to the keybinds and the different navigation structure, but i think with enough practice one can get pretty skilled
[2022-12-22 20:11:57] <@%Kem_> biggest L is lack of blockmixing i believe
[2022-12-22 20:12:04] <@%Kem_> and items
[2022-12-22 20:12:17] <%Yar2000> lack of blockmix is an oof

[2022-12-22 20:46:59] <%nnuhhan> To be honest, I really miss him. I understand people are upset. But I used to watch his stream every day and now is really hard to watch some content. I know he can’t just come back. He needs to apologize to people who supported him, like me. And to players in the leaderboards. We know his attitude was bad and the things he did. But still we can learn from the errors. I’m sure he’s feeling really bad. And for people who don’t think like me, that’s ok. Just take it easy as a personal opinion.
