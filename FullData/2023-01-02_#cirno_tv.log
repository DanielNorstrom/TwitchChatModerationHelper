[2023-01-02 19:01:45] <BirbFacts> Cheer10 As vertebrate animals, birds are ultimately related to all the other vertebrate animals that live or ever have lived on earth. But you may be surprised to learn that the family of vertebrates to which modern birds are most closely related is the crocodiles, which evolved, like dinosaurs, from a population of archosaur reptiles during the late Triassic period. Dinosaurs, pterosaurs and marine reptiles all went kaput in the K/T Extinction Event, but crocodiles somehow managed to survive.

[2023-01-02 19:49:10] <%BoSteed> donkTalk The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. donkTalk

[2023-01-02 22:20:53] <%KimiMayushi> Why did you ban me? just because I was writing in complete and coherent sentences? I'm sorry that the internet has become so dumbed down that no one can understand my enhanced intellect. I guess it doesn't surprise me that the people watching this overweight, disgusting lard bucket wouldn't want someone as gifted as myself invading their safe space. Still, I feel it is my duty to raise the average IQ in the chat from below the ocean floor, so I humbly ask you unban me
