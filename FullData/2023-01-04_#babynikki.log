[2023-01-04 18:05:41] <%brewssssss> It sucks that it‚Äôs like that. Cuz for the most part the gym is very welcoming, but there is always a couple people that make you feel like shit about yourself
[2023-01-04 18:05:46] <+HiddenInTheClouds> I used to be like that until I realized most ppl dgaf and are too focused on their workout

[2023-01-04 18:09:23] <%MelMunny> So i just found this app that connects you with a personal trainer remotely. And they design workouts for you and it shows you how to do everything
[2023-01-04 18:09:24] <%+LyviaXO> I wish there was a women gym near me
[2023-01-04 18:09:29] <%perzevol> personal trainers are great, purely for the motivation imo
[2023-01-04 18:09:34] <%+LyviaXO> met too many freaks at the gym

[2023-01-04 18:09:53] <%brewssssss> They are stupid expensive
[2023-01-04 18:09:55] <%+Bags94> the bike classes or the high intensity workout classes. or even yoga classes can be great
[2023-01-04 18:09:57] <%+GevoArt> i finished the new season of mob psycho, it was so good, also hi!
[2023-01-04 18:09:57] <%MelMunny> but cheaper than an IRL personal trainer

[2023-01-04 20:22:16] <sirlurksalot999> they promised you a ton of money as long as you get 10 more family or friends to join
[2023-01-04 20:22:51] <sirlurksalot999> from ppl who join later
[2023-01-04 20:23:02] <$BabyDucksss> person on top -> sells to person below -> person they sold to sells to person below and repeat
[2023-01-04 20:23:03] <+Cataztrophe> it's basically just convincing a bunch of people to sell your product
[2023-01-04 20:23:07] <Meckdee> Example: you get 10 people to pay you $10 each. $100 profit. Then you tell them they can make $10 by just getting 10 people themselves
[2023-01-04 20:23:08] <Waterfault> Aliens created the pyramid (schemes)
[2023-01-04 20:23:12] <$BabyDucksss> hence pyramid scheme, basically person at very top makes most money
[2023-01-04 20:23:27] <%PosAjdin> Its basically like if you refer someone personally you get 5% of all sales and everyone they refer after you bring them in you get 2%. Something like that.
[2023-01-04 20:23:35] <+tcast95> You want to be at the top of the Pyramid and have a bunch of people working under you
