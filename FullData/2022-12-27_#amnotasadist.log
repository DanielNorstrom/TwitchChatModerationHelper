[2022-12-27 23:48:41] <%ChaoticCheshire24> well you have the shield so that helps
[2022-12-27 23:48:53] <+ladythalia14> for this game you can multiple elemental balls but to keep them that way you need a geo/anemo/dendro character btw

[2022-12-27 23:50:15] <mayqs> another emo song damnn the vibe
[2022-12-27 23:50:23] <lyr444> hydro
[2022-12-27 23:50:23] <+ladythalia14> so if want to have one pyro and one electro without constantly swapping back and forth. once you have two different elemental balls the geo/dendro/anemo will not change the elements
[2022-12-27 23:50:24] <%ChaoticCheshire24> no just not pyro this round
[2022-12-27 23:50:52] <%samsellsjams> npthing
[2022-12-27 23:50:55] <%ChaoticCheshire24> anemo does nothing
[2022-12-27 23:50:58] <%samsellsjams> no anemo
[2022-12-27 23:51:01] <%samsellsjams> it does nothing
[2022-12-27 23:51:02] <%ChaoticCheshire24> along with dendro and geo
[2022-12-27 23:51:23] <$kokomishotgf> anemo don’t do shit
[2022-12-27 23:51:27] <+ladythalia14> anemo/geo/dendro is underrated for this game mode
[2022-12-27 23:51:41] <%ChaoticCheshire24> omg

[2022-12-27 23:53:53] <mayqs> its okay but boring
[2022-12-27 23:53:55] <%samsellsjams> yes it is
[2022-12-27 23:53:55] <x_cortney_rae_x> eh, good way to good primos and mora though
[2022-12-27 23:54:01] <Fall_enRaven> it makes my brain hurt a lil but that's just the overthinking

[2022-12-27 23:54:20] <%samsellsjams> yes
[2022-12-27 23:54:22] <%ChaoticCheshire24> probably
[2022-12-27 23:54:23] <x_cortney_rae_x> i just mainly use electro and pyro and get a shit ton of points

[2022-12-27 23:54:41] <+L1ddl3> idk about this event.. story was kinda nice but the gameplay was so shit imo
[2022-12-27 23:54:42] <%admin_yee> it kinda gets better when you get more options and balls balls everywhere
[2022-12-27 23:54:51] <$kokomishotgf> @x_cortney_rae_x u sadgely can’t use pyro on this stage
[2022-12-27 23:54:58] <hilmiaziz> you need 4.5k for max reward
[2022-12-27 23:54:59] <KaizuNima> some perks do make it much easier
