[2022-12-21 00:03:57] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-21 17:00:28] <RavageFlame> i hate that the bundle was 1 coin now my coins are weird
[2022-12-21 17:00:37] <ow_sigmaeats> That’s is to expensive
[2022-12-21 17:00:44] <tomu__> that 1 coin is worth 10 coins as thats the smallest you can earn back
[2022-12-21 17:00:58] <goodylive5> @emongg i was your junker queen last game and i feel like i play her poorly
[2022-12-21 17:01:00] <pokeydude3> @Emongg you should encourage one of your supports to pick lucio to absolutely hunt enemies down
[2022-12-21 17:01:25] <Preston_849> im having trouble deciding whether im trash at ow or of skill based matchmaking isnt a thing in this game

[2022-12-21 17:02:24] <+jarrhead2> tanks is too easy
[2022-12-21 17:02:32] <+lindhop> With every hero do something similar but watered down.  Tier it how you feel when you get one on your team -_-

[2022-12-21 17:02:47] <+aaymon86> Tanks.  But do you have a fairly good idea of the state of Doomfist?  He's in a rough spot now.
[2022-12-21 17:02:48] <%ChipJiggins> A hero tier list would be pretty quick. It's Bastion #1, and then everyone else
[2022-12-21 17:02:51] <%+lorkrac> do a pov:junkerqueen tier list
[2022-12-21 17:02:56] <pokeydude3> do a battle pass content tier list lol

[2022-12-21 17:03:23] <+taleswapper1> She's got those five extra bullets now, so S tier
[2022-12-21 17:03:23] <+5pecial_6uest> S w/ Soj/Orisa, C everything else
[2022-12-21 17:03:24] <%+0druid0> B

[2022-12-21 17:03:27] <%+eemby8> I'd say A Tier just because she can heal very quickly, is mobile, and can dmg boost
[2022-12-21 17:03:29] <noctan82> A
[2022-12-21 17:03:29] <$spacepirate549> S tier with sojourn, b otherwise

[2022-12-21 17:03:32] <madskillsjay15> mercy is a tier

[2022-12-21 17:03:39] <+brizaayy> A
[2022-12-21 17:03:40] <%ChipJiggins> Easy S -- she's so hard to kill while healing someone
[2022-12-21 17:03:47] <%$TnT_06> B for support, S for DPS
[2022-12-21 17:03:50] <Weakndope> and u always have a sojourn on your team

[2022-12-21 17:04:09] <samepuddle> those 5 extra bullets though
[2022-12-21 17:04:12] <samepuddle> they really hit diff
[2022-12-21 17:04:21] <pokeydude3> @Emongg you could also ditch a hero tier list and do a battle pass tier list /s
[2022-12-21 17:04:30] <Curtsy> I actually hate playing Mercy now, because every single time there's a Sojurn I am expected to play attached to their ass the whole game

[2022-12-21 17:08:33] <%+nothinggood27> @Re4prTWITCH I'd call meta defining S+, I'd say Soj is S+, making mercy "S" in this meta, maybe?
[2022-12-21 17:08:38] <+Chains3> @ChristianSharkTV Ah right!
[2022-12-21 17:08:55] <Ninety3Percent> @nothinggood27 S+ defeats the purpose of tiers, why add + and -
[2022-12-21 17:09:00] <pigtrader3231> No
[2022-12-21 17:09:04] <almost_addictive> probably A-
[2022-12-21 17:09:05] <+imjustsaiyan03> probs to A

[2022-12-21 17:09:07] <%+lorkrac> A
[2022-12-21 17:09:07] <pokeydude3> no, because hook can be blocked by other things
[2022-12-21 17:09:08] <ChristianSharkTV> No
[2022-12-21 17:09:09] <pigtrader3231> A
[2022-12-21 17:09:13] <Weakndope> ana too strong then
[2022-12-21 17:09:15] <Re4prTWITCH> yeah, but if they would nuke Sojourn, suddenly you'd lose mercy etc as S tier as wel. S should be the heroes which make the meta. If they'd nerf mercy, sojourn would still be good
[2022-12-21 17:09:22] <pigtrader3231> Ana would go up
[2022-12-21 17:09:26] <pigtrader3231> To an s
[2022-12-21 17:09:32] <shcooty> No becasue he gets no clensd
[2022-12-21 17:09:42] <+carniehand> That's like saying that Lucio wasn't S tier in GOATS because Brigette was what enabled that meta
[2022-12-21 17:09:58] <Re4prTWITCH> hmnnnn, yeah, I'd argue Kiriko is the S, hog is the A.

[2022-12-21 17:10:46] <%+nothinggood27> @Ninety3Percent S+ is an incredibly common rating in the tier system LUL, I get what you're saying tho, make Mercy "A". Just hard when other heros that feel "A" tier have less impact than a blue beam on a Soj
[2022-12-21 17:10:55] <pigtrader3231> Wrecking ball is a strong character in an anti ball meta

[2022-12-21 17:11:24] <Re4prTWITCH> yeah sure, meta is a revolving door. But I dont think you need to define the whole meta comp as S, only the heroes that actually define the comp

[2022-12-21 17:11:40] <Re4prTWITCH> we pick hog and mercy because of kiriko and sojourn, not the other way around

[2022-12-21 17:37:21] <ChristianSharkTV> @joeisyourhero Because Fortnite is more generous with the free currency so it’s easier to spend less money or no money on skins

[2022-12-21 17:37:44] <xxmegapunch> the one thing i dont understand about overwatch is the rank system. trying to get past gold one dps. everytime i get on a good win streak i get put into a lobby multiple games straight against diamonds and my whole team is silver (according to their career profile)  how is the matchmaking that broken. how are you supposed to climb like that.
[2022-12-21 17:37:45] <%Joeisyourhero> @ChristianSharkTV that's mostly fair

[2022-12-21 18:30:30] <Fate_Chunk> not really less than 10 hours played on OV1
[2022-12-21 18:30:40] <Augmented_1> I noticed the changes yesterday from the blogpost, today, feels like they got rolled back, anyone else?
[2022-12-21 18:30:46] <%+AddBnr> i saw your matchmaking dev explain video i noticed that they used almost the same system as CSGO which is driven by Glicko-2 the rank is a range not a number
[2022-12-21 18:31:05] <+JohnS_87> i tried ramattra for the first time yesterday in comp, haven't played him yet. super fun. we actually won lol
[2022-12-21 18:31:14] <+Nessfalco> feels like that should have been obvious
[2022-12-21 18:31:33] <Cormical> it feels awful as an old account
[2022-12-21 18:31:35] <%+BeardOfWonder> After playing exclusively MH I placed in Silver 4 when I finally placed for support in OW2
[2022-12-21 18:31:35] <%+Lady_Reign_> I'm not new and I feel like I'm tryna climb way too hard
[2022-12-21 18:31:41] <Fate_Chunk> i was just surprised i skipped bronze tbh
[2022-12-21 18:31:42] <%+forbade_> I played overwatch 1 and placed in high plat, but in overwatch 2 it placed me in low gold and I have over 700 hours on overwatch
[2022-12-21 18:31:44] <%artboyo> yes new players have higher lose rate in higher ranks
[2022-12-21 18:31:49] <+maktrophies> My first comp game in overwatch 1 It put me in a diamond lobby and it was not fun when I climbed down all the way to bronze

[2022-12-21 18:32:22] <+Lacrymosa22> YES SAME i was put in a diamond lobby, in my first games. I got pummeled because i had no idea what i was doing
[2022-12-21 18:32:28] <slashcake> Yo im new in the game who do you think i should main?
[2022-12-21 18:32:30] <%dapdude25> Its almost like winning is fun emongSmile
[2022-12-21 18:32:51] <TurnOil> @emongg hey im relatively new to the game, in your opinion, whats the hardest role in the game? which role has the highest skill cap as well?
[2022-12-21 18:32:56] <chaseman123> on the flip side bronze lobbies will get rolled by new players more often
[2022-12-21 18:33:04] <heartlessfox21> @slashcake probably tracer
[2022-12-21 18:33:10] <TheSpecks> Not everyone can be ranked up. There’s always got to be someone that loses
[2022-12-21 18:33:12] <%TRex8907> That was super entertaining when you and flats played it takes two
[2022-12-21 18:33:17] <zafi45> Emongg… you have the developers ear. We need to get a Ramattra Druid skin.
[2022-12-21 18:33:27] <Vroxxes32> id say dps way more heros
[2022-12-21 18:33:32] <Synergism__> You think they should take blowouts into account or just do pure W/L for mmr?
[2022-12-21 18:33:35] <Weakndope> not role. its the hero specifically
[2022-12-21 18:33:42] <Vroxxes32> that all play differently
[2022-12-21 18:33:48] <+Nessfalco> depends what you mean by "skill". dps is probably most mechanically demanding, but you need to know more about the game for tanking/support.
[2022-12-21 18:33:48] <%artboyo> who chooses roles by skill cap rather than what you just enjoy LUL
[2022-12-21 18:33:52] <slashcake> Im talking about caracters
[2022-12-21 18:33:54] <destinyslayed> is Mei an ok hero to play in low elo?
[2022-12-21 18:33:54] <%+tonitheitalian> i feel on the play styles, im high silver almost gold on support and tank but still bronze 5 on dps haha

[2022-12-21 18:38:19] <+aaymon86> He outrages Sigma, shield is almost as good, and Nemesis for should destroy Sigma up close.

[2022-12-21 18:45:05] <@%^StreamElements> DemonStrate86, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2022-12-21 18:46:15] <+aaymon86> Ram can kinda do it all from a tank standpoint. Poke and Brawl. Has Orisa like sustain. And prob has the best area denial ults in the tank category.
[2022-12-21 18:46:17] <ItsCraigAgainZA> how much dmg does a punch do?

[2022-12-21 18:46:32] <DemonStrate86> @TheNastyFridge I wonder how different that is. I've played WASD since like 1998.
[2022-12-21 18:46:36] <Josheerz> they need to change his cooldown time in my opinion
[2022-12-21 18:46:56] <ItsCraigAgainZA> @ItsCraigAgainZA really? it feels like 20 dmg

[2022-12-21 18:47:09] <Gjared98> If anyone’s knows: if you have never ranked and you play comp, are you playing against other non ranked players?

[2022-12-21 18:48:13] <DemonStrate86> @TheNastyFridge Now-a-days, you can get a 60% layout keyboard, and it isn't that bad for WASD. Or you can just get a half-keyboard too (just the left half).

[2022-12-21 18:48:35] <hotasstwink> you play w ppl near your MMR, matchmaking rating so yes most likely unranked or near your performance @gjared98

[2022-12-21 18:48:43] <+aaymon86> Question. If Ram is half health in omnic form, goes into Nemesis and gains armor, if you cancel it, will he have that extra 225 added to his half health?
[2022-12-21 18:48:53] <SkitzoCTRL> @aaymon86 No.
[2022-12-21 18:48:55] <ItsCraigAgainZA> yeah matchmaking really bad, i'm silver at most on all pos and i'm constantly getting highest dps on any role, like getting best dps on zen
[2022-12-21 18:49:35] <+wildrness> why play zen when u can play dps moira
[2022-12-21 18:49:39] <+aaymon86> Ok, I was curious if he could essentially self heal that way out of battle. Cool, thanks. @skitzoctrl
[2022-12-21 18:49:44] <spreckles_450> @ItsCraigAgainZA That sounds more like you are better than the rank you are in, and can't carry games
[2022-12-21 18:49:48] <ChristianSharkTV> @itscraigagainza I’ve played tank games that had my Lucio get more kills than my Sojourn & Junkrat
[2022-12-21 18:49:57] <%$TheNastyFridge> @wildrness Because Zen can kick people in the face, obviously NODDERS

[2022-12-21 18:52:06] <@%^StreamElements> HauntedSniper, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2022-12-21 18:55:21] <%stillarobyn> @ItsCraigAgainZA queue time doesn't reflect mmr/rank at all, just availability of lobbies estimated by the game

[2022-12-21 18:55:29] <punkW> @ItsCraigAgainZA super has like 2 minute dps queues but 15 minute tank queues, no
[2022-12-21 18:55:29] <SkitzoCTRL> @ItsCraigAgainZA No, you can stay in QP all you want. You have a hidden MMR in QP that will go up and down and, if you do decide to play ranked, your rank will be that hidden MMR.
[2022-12-21 18:55:30] <Fate_Chunk> Most of the community I have had interactions with are the typical "I do nothing wrong its everyone elses fault im losing" type and I just mute them

[2022-12-21 18:55:42] <Synergism__> @Synergism__ lol yea. Comp games turn into people flaming their own team expecting them to play better as they are currently tilting them into being worse
[2022-12-21 18:55:47] <%$TheNastyFridge> @ItsCraigAgainZA NO idea on either of those points, we don't really know how QP MMR and Comp MMR relate to each other or if there is maybe even just one MMR for both, might be answered in the next blog post
[2022-12-21 18:55:49] <SkitzoCTRL> @Evil_Cream I know it does make a difference, it's just frustrating. It's like playing a bot game.

[2022-12-21 18:58:05] <SkitzoCTRL> @TheNastyFridge Yeah, that's what I'm stating. The hidden MMR stays the same if you never go into Comp, but, once you queue for Comp, it starts to vary.

[2022-12-21 18:58:19] <spreckles_450> @spreckles_450 That's because QP matchmaking is a lot more loose, since it focuses on getting matches quickly (hence the name quickplay).  Because of that, you are going to get a lot of skill varience

[2022-12-21 19:00:19] <SkitzoCTRL> @TheNastyFridge Yes, your competitive hidden MMR and your unranked MMR will begin to vary because your win/loss/performance in the respective playlists. However, your unranked games will always have variance because the MMR range that you can queue with/against is greater.

[2022-12-21 19:49:14] <+Nessfalco> mercy lucio kills me inside
[2022-12-21 19:49:14] <+Steph_You_Up> @probablynotaspider ya I'd say if you're low ranks trying to cling, just play Bap til like diamond then switch to Kiriko
[2022-12-21 19:49:16] <+ThriceNightly> its so bad
[2022-12-21 19:49:22] <+m0therlode> i still vouch A tier for Bap
[2022-12-21 19:49:25] <GryphonXCV> why should both lucio and mercy be s tier if they can't be played together?
[2022-12-21 19:49:34] <Afamonso> what about zen?
[2022-12-21 19:49:34] <danielfortskewer> ive seen so many mercy mains recently man, i hate it, i just wanna play lucio man
[2022-12-21 19:49:34] <%$TheNastyFridge> @boopiedunk Not just the person, if your whole team positions like trash, it can get really difficult to keep yourself safe while still supporting them Sadge
[2022-12-21 19:49:35] <%+bahbon> bap A tier
[2022-12-21 19:49:38] <!%blizz_megan> @blizz_megan i'm just freaking out like WHY AND HOW DID I THROW MYSELF INTO THE ENEMY TEAM
[2022-12-21 19:49:41] <sirebot0> Zen C tier
[2022-12-21 19:49:41] <%+KShellZx> Mercy is SO dependent on her teammates though no?
[2022-12-21 19:49:50] <%+bahbon> zen is C
[2022-12-21 19:49:51] <%+Linsinco> @KShellZx this
[2022-12-21 19:49:51] <%+KShellZx> moreso than other supports
[2022-12-21 19:49:56] <+Evil_Cream> theres no F tier?
[2022-12-21 19:49:59] <+TheIceMan9304> I'll fight any of you!  Mercy in silver......!-= mercy in masters
[2022-12-21 19:49:59] <+m0therlode> @KShellZx exactly
[2022-12-21 19:50:06] <+Steph_You_Up> Bap just feels clunky the higher you climb, Kiriko s just better the faster the game gets
[2022-12-21 19:50:07] <GreyWolfLars> true
[2022-12-21 19:50:14] <Toddlesworth> MERCY SOJOURN ZEN IN QUICK PLAY REEEEEEEEEE
[2022-12-21 19:50:17] <sh_maximus> res is sooooo good
[2022-12-21 19:50:18] <+m0therlode> but mercy's not as complete as bap
[2022-12-21 19:50:23] <obbss20> mercy and genji too
[2022-12-21 19:50:25] <+aaymon86> Mercy/ Bap or Lucio/Bap still works well.
[2022-12-21 19:50:26] <SethhhEl> Your cat wants attention
[2022-12-21 19:50:28] <+nezukolul> Ana should be S tier now
[2022-12-21 19:50:30] <ChristianSharkTV> I’d say Mercy would be a B without Sojourn, S with Sojourn. So A IMO @emongg
[2022-12-21 19:50:36] <gluedballs> ok but in terms of "FUN" Bap is S+ tier
[2022-12-21 19:50:41] <+Guts72> Why is mercy not played in Contenders?

[2022-12-21 19:50:43] <%+supernod83> @blizz_megan I do it when i am trying to save someone, but they die on my way there, then you have nothing you can can but sit there and die.
[2022-12-21 19:50:46] <+nezukolul> Nano charges faster
[2022-12-21 19:50:47] <Deadtom29> Mercy is A just because of the dependency
[2022-12-21 19:50:47] <%$TheNastyFridge> @blizz_megan I feel that TOGGLE: OFF for GA helps with that, and also try to use slingshot GA solely for backwards escaping, not to reposition towards teammates...unless it's Valk and you wanna fling your BatlleMercy butt into the enemy team to murder them kekDog
[2022-12-21 19:50:49] <%KarQ> good list
[2022-12-21 19:50:58] <+Steph_You_Up> Ana is fine but she's too immobile to  e S tier
[2022-12-21 19:50:58] <+TheIceMan9304> and an ADS ana is food for kiriko

[2022-12-21 19:51:03] <+m0therlode> ok
[2022-12-21 19:51:04] <+aaymon86> Is Kirko better than him?  Sure, but that doesn't mean he's still not A imo

[2022-12-21 19:53:29] <+TheIceMan9304> you can't leave her at C just because of someone who plays her a certain way, what if Ana just tries to dps?
[2022-12-21 19:53:29] <GreyWolfLars> and then u run off
[2022-12-21 19:53:29] <Metal_Mitch> I’d rather have a zen than a moira. Discord on hog, orisa, or doom does way more for the team than Moira could dream

[2022-12-21 19:56:09] <Bohican> moira is definitely worse than bap

[2022-12-21 19:56:26] <$critical_physx> bap doesnt completely turn a game by himself, unless they are god tier player, but thats player skill more than bap himself, B tier is right

[2022-12-21 20:00:11] <ShanghaiKid81> C

[2022-12-21 20:00:29] <+Paigey90> is this why people rage at me for playing Zen ?
[2022-12-21 20:00:29] <OWSasquatch> Only good in Sig/Orisa comps rn and gets destroyed by Hog/Dive tanks
[2022-12-21 20:00:31] <%+Yokutto> I dont think he is worse than moira
[2022-12-21 20:00:34] <%+KShellZx> zen just has no escapability
[2022-12-21 20:00:36] <%$TheNastyFridge> C, because with everything else is played, Zen will get lonely in the backline and will get killed too easily
[2022-12-21 20:00:37] <drafi_> zen can't be lower than moira
[2022-12-21 20:00:41] <+nezukolul> Zen  =  C

[2022-12-21 20:02:47] <%+GhostshipRobot> B Tier. He has so much going for him. He kills, he moves, he survives. But he doesn't OUT DPS many A and S tier heroes.
[2022-12-21 20:02:47] <halimtech> yeah
[2022-12-21 20:02:48] <%+sw33tt3adream> He's really not A, compared

[2022-12-21 20:02:52] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> Soldier is A tier in lower ranks
[2022-12-21 20:02:54] <m3l1ssa2000> He’s a hitscan, so he’s an easy A or B

[2022-12-21 20:02:55] <GreyWolfLars> moira level tbh
[2022-12-21 20:02:56] <forkmore> B tier, he can be played anytime really but he can't really carry
[2022-12-21 20:02:57] <%+jsapphire6> B for soldier
[2022-12-21 20:02:57] <halimtech> I like B tier

[2022-12-21 20:02:58] <luazri> if it wasn't for the helix he'd be lower
[2022-12-21 20:03:00] <UnlimitedRinWorks> B is fair for Soldier

[2022-12-21 20:03:09] <halimtech> he is A with kiriko maybe

[2022-12-21 20:08:47] VIEWERS: 2 889
[2022-12-21 20:08:48] <%+GhostshipRobot> Thing about Genji is he sucks for 3-5 minutes then gets a 5K.
[2022-12-21 20:08:48] <%TheClimbingSloth> Genji is being played in pro level
[2022-12-21 20:08:49] <raymonhaddad_> Tbh S tier he needs nerfs
[2022-12-21 20:08:50] <+citizendolan> C only because his brother is worse
[2022-12-21 20:08:51] <+aura_n> still honestly D
[2022-12-21 20:08:51] <+GsyBoy> really?
[2022-12-21 20:08:52] <+juggernautmd> C-
[2022-12-21 20:08:52] <%+Eragon_Cola> A god genji is an least B tier tho
[2022-12-21 20:08:52] <+TheIceMan9304> maybe it's me
[2022-12-21 20:08:56] <quesodilla43> soldier is so C tier
[2022-12-21 20:08:56] <%+sw33tt3adream> I know but it's bologna
[2022-12-21 20:08:57] <$mysticoverwatch> c sadge
[2022-12-21 20:08:58] <m3l1ssa2000> What LUL
[2022-12-21 20:08:58] <GreyWolfLars> its to make a point
[2022-12-21 20:08:59] <raymonhaddad_> Honestly S Tier
[2022-12-21 20:08:59] <%$TheNastyFridge> I think his high mobility and finisher-potential makes him better than Cass
[2022-12-21 20:09:06] <fakekeks> A tier
[2022-12-21 20:09:06] <+jarrhead2> ccc
[2022-12-21 20:09:06] <m3l1ssa2000> He’s still good tho
[2022-12-21 20:09:08] <%+benjiionps> b

[2022-12-21 20:09:11] <+citizendolan> Yea clean C
[2022-12-21 20:09:12] <SirTryhard7> SeemsGood
[2022-12-21 20:09:13] <dodrugs> is genji worse than bastion
[2022-12-21 20:09:15] <skar360> man they really need to nerf gengu again
[2022-12-21 20:09:15] <+GhoulishNW> calling it, only other D is gonna be queen
[2022-12-21 20:09:16] <%+GhostshipRobot> Genji is not powerful on his own. He REQUIRES a BOSS playing him.
[2022-12-21 20:09:17] <+GsyBoy> wow
[2022-12-21 20:09:19] <%+sw33tt3adream> Leave him alone Blizzard
[2022-12-21 20:09:19] <+citizendolan> @dodrugs yes

[2022-12-21 20:09:22] <%$TheNastyFridge> He's about as good as Bastion I think, and he can keep up with a slippery Mercy
[2022-12-21 20:09:23] <+Belowavrge> I think echo goes up to A and genji goes. B
[2022-12-21 20:09:27] <%+Eragon_Cola> True trick the devs into buffing him
[2022-12-21 20:09:27] <+TheIceMan9304> he's not going to get a buff

[2022-12-21 20:09:52] <ShanghaiKid81> D-tier.  Hanzo doesn't get DPS passive
[2022-12-21 20:09:52] <%$TheNastyFridge> Random logs to the face = clearly at least B
[2022-12-21 20:09:53] <%TheClimbingSloth> Did you watch the Legends battle? Genji got played a lot
[2022-12-21 20:09:53] <+citizendolan> yes
[2022-12-21 20:09:54] <+DURBY8> Is recoil staying?
[2022-12-21 20:09:55] <zarall> yeah C
[2022-12-21 20:09:55] <Morcatti_> C
[2022-12-21 20:09:56] <gabe3_18> I find Recoil Sooo Dumb😂
[2022-12-21 20:09:56] <+phixed_days> stop the count LUL
[2022-12-21 20:09:57] <+GsyBoy> annoying as f though
[2022-12-21 20:09:57] <UnlimitedRinWorks> Right there with Genji KEKW
[2022-12-21 20:09:58] <+aaymon86> I mean Hanzo without recoil is still C imo
[2022-12-21 20:09:59] <+citizendolan> D tier or F tier
[2022-12-21 20:10:00] <+TheIceMan9304> the one hit potential gives him C I think
[2022-12-21 20:10:00] <+tjepp38> Good clearing ult
[2022-12-21 20:10:01] <+RuggedAK> Its a mechanic :)
[2022-12-21 20:10:02] <darksteil> C
[2022-12-21 20:10:02] <gabe3_18> Y they added recoil?
[2022-12-21 20:10:03] <%+jsapphire6> Hanzo d

[2022-12-21 20:10:06] <+aura_n> fair enough
[2022-12-21 20:10:09] <+GsyBoy> spamzo
[2022-12-21 20:10:09] <+HueyLewisFan> no dps passive too
[2022-12-21 20:10:10] <+DURBY8> Is it a bug or nerf
[2022-12-21 20:10:11] <%$TheNastyFridge> But one-shot potential emongL
[2022-12-21 20:10:12] <ShanghaiKid81> No DPS Passive
[2022-12-21 20:10:12] <%+heyyobry> D
[2022-12-21 20:10:15] <+nezukolul> Hanzo is so divable

[2022-12-21 20:10:17] <%+Chitma_Pance> That bug doesn't affect my gameplay.
[2022-12-21 20:10:17] <+dukdukmoose> is it a bug that he has recoil?
[2022-12-21 20:10:18] <nessrh> Put him with is brother
[2022-12-21 20:10:19] <UnlimitedRinWorks> @gabe3_18 It's supposedly a bug
[2022-12-21 20:10:20] <%+GhostshipRobot> Another hero that requires a very specific style of play with very high skill otherwise he is just a Feeding Freddy.
[2022-12-21 20:10:25] <opbird0909> No passive!
[2022-12-21 20:10:25] <%+jsapphire6> Seagull thinks he is terrible
[2022-12-21 20:10:25] <%+kustom138> the no passive for him moves him down a tier
[2022-12-21 20:10:26] <+theaykos> Accidental headshots makes him always fine
[2022-12-21 20:10:28] <%+supernod83> He's okay, but there are other options that can do better as present
[2022-12-21 20:10:30] <fakekeks> correct
[2022-12-21 20:10:30] <GreyWolfLars> hanzo is sooo skillbased
[2022-12-21 20:10:31] <+HueyLewisFan> C is fair imo
[2022-12-21 20:10:33] <%+GhostshipRobot> C or D
[2022-12-21 20:10:34] <ZibLardh> no passive

[2022-12-21 20:23:01] <lacedup_i_so_bad> wrecking ball is a map base character
[2022-12-21 20:23:01] <+aura_n> if ball is there why is genji higher in C?

[2022-12-21 20:23:24] <raymonhaddad_> they need to nerf Hammond with genji
[2022-12-21 20:23:25] <%+GhostshipRobot> People sit there using guns to hold point with Ball instead of rolling around!!! They piss me off so much.
[2022-12-21 20:23:27] <%qanax3> Wrecking ball D tier makes sense - look at all the streamers who stream ball... they aren't playing ball

[2022-12-21 20:24:18] <%zonar_ow> just put him in the middle at B. he's not OP but he's playable

[2022-12-21 20:24:46] <GreyWolfLars> agree
[2022-12-21 20:24:50] <%+smittnkittn93> I would say B, cause good Dooms are a nightmare to play against

[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <TheDrobbit> Sigma is the most polyvalent tank
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <gabe696969696969696969> TOESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <andreas_or8> UNDERATED
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <+Thenorthranger> Sigma can beat hog on certain maps
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <DemonStrate86> B
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <m3l1ssa2000> His damage output is insane, easy A!
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <chaseman123> map dependent
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <Daphobic> If Sigma A then Orisa S
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <+SimoneMrg> Orisa is 10x better though
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <flouse> B
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <Vyrile> A
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <beerguyjason> Sigma is low A
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <%$TheNastyFridge> Na, B seems good for Sigma, maybe B+
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <%+benjiionps> AA
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <%PaulBP7> Sigma gets his own tier, BA
[2022-12-21 20:33:17] <%+GhostshipRobot> You're the T500 Tank. You tell us!
[2022-12-21 20:33:18] <forkmore> LUL
[2022-12-21 20:33:18] <SuperChicken387> Low A tier
[2022-12-21 20:33:18] <+danielferrine> Sigma too situational imo
[2022-12-21 20:33:18] <johnnydcrook> With Lucio meta, he gets rushed a lot
[2022-12-21 20:33:18] <%+smittnkittn93> I think A is more accurate
[2022-12-21 20:33:19] <espresso13_> A!
[2022-12-21 20:33:19] <+benbox3> sigma is not on the same level as orisa
[2022-12-21 20:33:19] <penguingod24> AAA
[2022-12-21 20:33:19] <MoeJooter> A cause he better than doom

[2022-12-21 20:33:22] <asafk7> A
[2022-12-21 20:33:23] <sorasolos5> he B
[2022-12-21 20:33:23] <%7thSea> All tanks are map dependent
[2022-12-21 20:33:23] <kasper93> sig can be countered so hard, but other tanks, it is B at best
[2022-12-21 20:33:23] <+citizendolan> I dunno….its like low A if he is A
[2022-12-21 20:33:24] <%NightRemedy> A
[2022-12-21 20:33:24] <21vinnie21> B+
[2022-12-21 20:33:25] <zarall> shouldnt orisa be higher?

[2022-12-21 20:33:26] <%+heyyobry> Better than Doom and Dva
[2022-12-21 20:33:26] <beachmontmonster> SIGMA MAP META
[2022-12-21 20:33:27] <ShanghaiKid81> Sig counters Orisa
[2022-12-21 20:33:27] <GreyWolfLars> B is full
[2022-12-21 20:33:27] <+TheIceMan9304> he's better than DVA
[2022-12-21 20:33:27] <%+heyyobry> So A tier
[2022-12-21 20:33:28] <+chief_ki3f> A
[2022-12-21 20:33:29] <+NPguitarPlayr> can't.  ypu already dropped him
[2022-12-21 20:33:30] <adrian10132015> Ok👌🏻
[2022-12-21 20:33:30] <SecretAnthony> if Sig is A then orisa is S
[2022-12-21 20:33:30] <%$ColdRamen_ow> Sigma can clutch pretty well
[2022-12-21 20:33:31] <boopiedunk> one of the best ults in the game, best sheild ability other than bubble
[2022-12-21 20:33:31] <johnnydcrook> Sig kinda gets bullied
[2022-12-21 20:33:32] <+TheIceMan9304> and I think dva is A
[2022-12-21 20:33:33] <+juggernautmd> I'd give sigma A-+
[2022-12-21 20:33:33] <%+smittnkittn93> Or at least B+
[2022-12-21 20:33:33] <aymansy99> B
[2022-12-21 20:33:35] <+DarkEagleCPG46> he has a one shot combo
[2022-12-21 20:33:36] <%wonkymonky_> yeah is sig is in A we need orisa in S
[2022-12-21 20:33:36] <%+0druid0> Sigma b tier
[2022-12-21 20:33:36] <chaseman123> @7thSea not hog orisa
[2022-12-21 20:33:36] <+HueyLewisFan> sigma is like widow and zen, very matchup and map dependant
[2022-12-21 20:33:38] <+aaymon86> The key to him is spacing and cooldown management.

[2022-12-21 20:33:42] <n0skun0ss0> He's better than dva and doom though
[2022-12-21 20:33:43] <bob_mcpob> hog needs his own category for being so broken
[2022-12-21 20:33:44] <%PaulBP7> Lmao
[2022-12-21 20:33:45] <+danielferrine> Orisa is a tier above Orisa
[2022-12-21 20:33:45] <SuperChicken387> heLow A tier
[2022-12-21 20:33:47] <%+GhostshipRobot> Sigma better than Dva and Doom.

[2022-12-21 20:33:48] <momo_nana007> Sig A-

[2022-12-21 20:33:59] <%+jestito99> he has good mitigation also
[2022-12-21 20:34:00] <TheMainCharacterOfEarth> he's great in diamond. A is good
[2022-12-21 20:34:01] <GreyWolfLars> agree
[2022-12-21 20:34:01] <%+GhostshipRobot> Sigma rocks. Literally.

[2022-12-21 20:34:04] <OWSasquatch> Sig plays into Orisa and Hog really well. If they are S/A then he should be A too
[2022-12-21 20:34:04] <johnnydcrook> Better than Doom/Dva. Not Orisa tier
[2022-12-21 20:34:05] <TheDrobbit> yeprock

[2022-12-21 20:34:10] <%+kustom138> A tier - if you were going to lock a tank a play them all night, you would probably have a better win rate on sig than other tanks
[2022-12-21 20:34:10] <%+Chitma_Pance> Best shield in the game!!!!!

[2022-12-21 21:07:07] <Kruiz01> its just me or junker queen passive feels a little meh..?
[2022-12-21 21:07:09] <+aaymon86> It's soooo bad.  It needs a huge buff.

[2022-12-21 21:07:23] <+AkitaCutie> playing junkerqueen == throwing the game
[2022-12-21 21:07:25] <+aaymon86> Maybe the play is to run around knifing people lol
[2022-12-21 21:07:44] <%+chris20sf> junker queen really is fun
[2022-12-21 21:07:57] <SirTryhard7> Me, too. Idk why it’s so fun
[2022-12-21 21:08:09] <dredlock470> JQ has a mythic skin maybe they will buff her COPIUM
[2022-12-21 21:08:11] <+justlurkingm8> my throne is where I say it is 😳
[2022-12-21 21:08:15] <feyybae> that skin is so legit. I can't wait to get it
[2022-12-21 21:08:15] <Frostbizzle> I think Queen is the kind of hero where if she gets even a slight buff it could make her OP
[2022-12-21 21:08:35] <boopiedunk> i wish her shout was more speed focused and less cooldown and she had more lifesteal in general, she would be a super mobile squishy tank with survivability like zarya
[2022-12-21 21:08:37] <Kruiz01> yeah, its fun to play her, but at least for me it's hard to make a big impact in fights vs the other tanks

[2022-12-21 21:10:47] <%$HellraiserMX> gotta say it's a wild design decision to nerf her so much and also release a hero that directly counters her so much
