[2022-12-27 18:55:01] <+NoTimee> @Shrek2ForDVD this guy knows
[2022-12-27 18:55:04] <nikator1> conq is good if you compare it to not having conq, if you compare it to other options its mediocre at best

[2022-12-27 19:40:22] <Kylon1235> akali seems pretty well balanced tbh
[2022-12-27 19:40:24] <%+lordokaos> how has the enemy team not surrendered?

[2022-12-27 19:40:46] <dreadmk45> i think Jak'sho by its self kind of useless sometimes if kench goes and forces an goredrinker first item but i could be wrong since id seen certain ksante players rush sunfire first than a jak sho but idk bout him to know his best synchronization in builds really
[2022-12-27 19:40:47] <Khrysto_Aion> I think yone is not balanced tbh
