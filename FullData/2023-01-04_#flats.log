[2023-01-04 00:54:37] <DubsCantAim> hey flats I was playing OverWatch last night and I wanted to get a challenge done for winning five arcade games so I clicked on mayhem because it sounded fun and it turns out we're in overtime for 25 minutes I genuinely hate that game mode now
[2023-01-04 00:54:40] <TheNat1> @hydrateordydrate808 I played overwatch for a while and then found out it was giving me seizures, so I started playing tf2 and had way more fun (mostly because I wasn't having seizures anymore)

[2023-01-04 00:54:46] <%+pandamension> we can't just nerf genji, we need to buff sojourn as well
[2023-01-04 00:54:46] <lucifer36943> anyone else reckon with the movement nerf dps got that really affected genji his melee and dash should've gotten a bleed effect like what junker queen has just without the healing
[2023-01-04 00:54:52] <big_cap94> seen a YT short where you think Queen knife should be bigger on return.     any other buffs you'd give her majesty?

[2023-01-04 20:20:18] <EverydayEnby> @kool_zero Tanks are well, Tanky. More health. DPS does good damage with damage boost. Pocket the DPS and fly to the tank if they need help. You wanna be a damage boost Mercy mostly I believe. Just from the videos I've watched

[2023-01-04 20:20:49] <+javian_brown> @kool_zero Basically it sums up to Mercy's utility being in her damage boost so you pocket your dps like Ashe and they get picks instead of sitting behind the tank and healing them the whole game

[2023-01-04 20:26:57] <%mchsraider> the problem with Overwatch is the sustain.  Too much healing in the game.  the answer is obviously nerf Genji

[2023-01-04 20:38:00] <EverydayEnby> @nickelback8469 nah I don't think so. support is the backbone of the team and offer way more utility than just healing.

[2023-01-04 20:38:11] <ThePrometheu5> can u call a Moira support is she's healing instead of tiktok dps tho? i guess shes a healer in that scenario, no util :D
[2023-01-04 20:38:17] <%$sofishdekat> @Mr_Ganks unfortunately, bronze roasts can only happen when enough submitters read and follow the rules.

[2023-01-04 21:37:54] <%+pandamension> @modestghost is the benadryl to help your watert eyes because of your comp games?
[2023-01-04 21:38:05] <%GhostshipRobot> @EverydayEnby I hear you. Remember that Ego works in both directions. It's "I'm the best" but it is also "I'm the worst". Just focus on listening to ONLY people who are better than you about actual technique. Don't just take advice from anyone on how to play better.

[2023-01-04 21:45:07] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2023-01-04 21:47:52] <%+pandamension> @readyplayermaddy_ work on not getting as tilted at teamate and focus on what decisions you made to get you killed. I play tank a lot and was low silver. I'm now low gold. I still struggle with not getting tilted by teammates, and my positioning still need a lot of work. but when I really start to focus on that instead of letting my ego say I'm better then this elo, I started to improve. You are probably better the the elo you are in but you won't get out until you let yourself out.

[2023-01-04 21:58:22] <%+pandamension> @readyplayermaddy_ trust me, not feeling the support on tank is infuriating. My problem was not play with the team by trying to push when no one wasn't, trying to make plays with no support. it's not about how many kills or damage. it's about getting that first pick or two. it's about know winning the team fight and not the 1v1s or flanking ect. that doesn't me not to flank, but the priority is to flank when it beneficial to the team in the fight.
