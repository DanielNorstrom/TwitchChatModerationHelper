[2022-12-22 16:04:03] <%brianthebroken85> This is clearly a challenge...an ultimate challenge...but this is also clearly FUN for you. And that makes it even more delightful to watch. :)

[2022-12-22 16:04:07] <Bfa07> Depends on what type of attentional issues are most prominent for your ADHD; e.g., selective attention or divided attention.
[2022-12-22 16:04:19] <+Vegetaux> ADHD is a attention deficit, imo it takes MUCH more attention to play two games at once lol
[2022-12-22 16:04:19] <@%$CasualEmma> @theanotherreality mikkaaCare
[2022-12-22 16:04:24] <Phelben> normal gaming will be extremely boring for you after this challenge run lol

[2022-12-22 16:05:00] <wolvenedvhart> ADHD has not issues focusing by it‚Äôs, it has issues maintaining focus on one thing for a prolonged time. Also most ADHDs can focus a lot more with things they enjoy, so I believe this would be insanely fun if into souls games
[2022-12-22 16:05:00] <Mikaey0> @Vegetaux Yeah, but ADHD people also have the ability to hyperfocus on something that properly stimulates them
[2022-12-22 16:05:01] <t0mahawk777> I have ADD and i have already problems with focusing on ONE thing

[2022-12-22 16:21:32] <@%Radolov> Cold gives a separate proc, and can have a good fit in phase 2, but bleed is good too. So I'm not sure.
[2022-12-22 16:21:46] <wolvenedvhart> Put frost on one and leave bleed on the other

[2022-12-22 16:24:18] <@%Radolov> @brianthebroken85 It can also you with "more" procs overall if you add the bleed and cold together. Since resistances increase with every proc.

[2022-12-22 18:37:23] <@%xblom> @s_ebecrep that would require buying new screens
[2022-12-22 18:37:26] <%writer_thirteen> if she is far enough from the screens, it's not impossible to see things on both very well (saying this without much experience myself)
[2022-12-22 18:37:28] <%Bmoney159> Yes lol
[2022-12-22 18:37:32] <Squishmii> I keep getting ads for leggings LUL
[2022-12-22 18:37:34] <+caprinictutor> This looks wildly difficult. The fact u can even play through Limgrave like this is impressive.
[2022-12-22 18:37:36] <%MikeRNight> Doing this means you need to know the game on an intimate level. Every boss, every move
[2022-12-22 18:37:41] <%Rybylyshk> h4rdcoremango oooh, that sounds confusing fgsD
[2022-12-22 18:37:42] <%jordan65536> mikkaaHmm playing 2 games is more difficult than playing only 1 gamer
