[2022-12-11 04:17:12] <+Skullcap8593> yup, its happened regularly since the ads became more invasive Burke
[2022-12-11 04:17:14] <king_of_noobs> @BurkeBlack im not sure if you have to do th 3 min ad every hour
[2022-12-11 04:17:16] <svoid> all the time
[2022-12-11 04:17:16] <BullPot> not on your channel
[2022-12-11 04:17:19] <1stBenjoseph> i will watch you tonight and see if adds pop for me it does on some "other" channels
[2022-12-11 04:17:21] <%gingytrucking> it happened to me on smashes channel :/
[2022-12-11 04:17:21] <BananaBean03> i think twitch should abandon ads
[2022-12-11 04:17:22] <%justInSoFlo> there were the banner ads
[2022-12-11 04:17:24] <dtoffmeyeahg> N ig
[2022-12-11 04:17:28] <%maxxmillian> burke they told you that you 'could' stop random ads and preroll by playing x amount of ads an hour, this is the only thing that stops random ads
[2022-12-11 04:17:28] <dtoffmeyeahg> Er
[2022-12-11 04:17:28] <Skarrudon> no i just loaded in =/
[2022-12-11 04:17:30] <+vicious93088> I get the side bar adds since I'm on my tablet
[2022-12-11 04:17:33] BAN: dtoffmeyeahg
[2022-12-11 04:17:35] <kaollle> it mainly depends if twitch forces an random ad @BurkeBlack and yes happend  a few times last week for me
[2022-12-11 04:17:38] <GreenGekkeau> I also have an issue where there will be a stream delay with audio and the only way to fix it is to refresh and when I do. I get ads.

[2022-12-11 04:17:56] <+Panda_c260> I haven't seen an ad on twitch since the marvels avengers game came out and I decided to get turbo instead of dealing with that crap

[2022-12-11 04:17:57] <Skarrudon> i thought the creators controlled the adds mostly
[2022-12-11 04:17:57] <%JebTRiX> Streamers will full ads is like every 12-16mins,  unwatchable
[2022-12-11 04:18:17] <%jake_wu6410> Haven’t experienced it when watching you Burke but on other streamers yes. Quite infuriating. :D
[2022-12-11 04:18:17] <%maxxmillian> yes burke
[2022-12-11 04:18:21] <wolfscout1950> yeah thats the best for us
[2022-12-11 04:18:23] <+Skullcap8593> its not just your channel tho Burke, its any channel it does it on
[2022-12-11 04:18:24] <%gingytrucking> yes plz burke :/
[2022-12-11 04:18:24] <BullPot> im not getting forced ads, only pre rolla
[2022-12-11 04:18:28] <%justInSoFlo> yeah. turbo is great.

[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <%djuice_> I always been telling you to run ads, while you take a bathroom break etc
[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <+PB4UGo2Bed> Yeap always badly timed
[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <wolfscout1950> we see ads while nothing happening
[2022-12-11 04:18:40] <%timewarper9000> @BananaBean03 its very important for them to make money unfortianatly becuse of inflation they alreasy had to lower streamers salerys.
[2022-12-11 04:18:44] <Skreepy1> this is what makes twitch turbo a must for me
[2022-12-11 04:18:45] <%Si_Cwan> thats one of the downsides if you use that incentive thing, they do it at whim
[2022-12-11 04:18:46] <@%Mrfarside44> @BurkeBlack we can run ads for you and such if want to do that
[2022-12-11 04:18:50] <%gingytrucking> ^
[2022-12-11 04:18:57] <+dunpealhunter87> everyone who watches twitch on a very regular basis should get turbo, no ads until they also change that LUL
[2022-12-11 04:18:58] <%gingytrucking> make your mods do that :D
[2022-12-11 04:19:02] <%PKM4STER> i get ads with like 3 ad blocks on LUL

[2022-12-11 04:20:31] <BullPot> no burke, momsnts aren't getting ruined. i get a pre roll then your channel is ad free rest of stream
[2022-12-11 04:20:32] <+Skullcap8593> @BurkeBlack never got the 7-8 ad count on your channel while watching on ipad, but on some bigger channels I have had it do it right in the middle of action. Its been abit of turn off to watch twitch on my ipad in bed as of late. PepeHands
[2022-12-11 04:20:33] <%justInSoFlo> he's the king of ads
[2022-12-11 04:20:35] <%djuice_> 3 mins of ads only stops prerolls like for 40mins isnt it?

[2022-12-11 04:21:04] <%timewarper9000> when im on youtube all of a sudden when ads are ran they get skiped after a second on my chromebook and I guess thats becuse of the trend micro check program I have or somthing but they just skip by.
[2022-12-11 04:21:13] <%jake_wu6410> @skullcap8593 I know the feeling
[2022-12-11 04:21:23] <%PKM4STER> oh well, smaller streamers can make some money off ads, so im not totally against it. but it sucks when a good part of the stream happens and it rolls out LUL
[2022-12-11 04:21:34] <+z_zodiac_z> @Strange_Inquiries Yes, but they are the ads that come up from the bottom of the screen. So they do not disturb watching.

[2022-12-11 04:28:19] <@%A_P_P_L_E_S> Its a more tactical take on Dawn of War @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-11 04:28:20] <+almightygriffin> DOW II
[2022-12-11 04:28:27] <@%A_P_P_L_E_S> So no. No base building
[2022-12-11 04:28:31] <!%40mmRaygun> @Davemented not a codex update, jut new sculpts
[2022-12-11 04:28:36] <!%40mmRaygun> * just
[2022-12-11 04:28:37] <%+Davemented> ahhh
[2022-12-11 04:28:45] <!%40mmRaygun> they just got a new codex anyways
[2022-12-11 04:28:53] <+Skullcap8593> Burke it plays like company of heroes 2
[2022-12-11 04:28:53] <%+Davemented> that's what I was saying
[2022-12-11 04:28:53] <+Mactheer159> i like how Burke's title is serving the Emporer as he palys the Tyranids
[2022-12-11 04:29:09] <@%A_P_P_L_E_S> Are yall just playing the normal? Not Retribution?

[2022-12-11 04:30:52] <@%A_P_P_L_E_S> @Mrfarside44 Honestly surprised they're not playing DoW3 its gotten some decentish updates. DoW1 is still superior to them all.
[2022-12-11 04:31:07] <+Skullcap8593> HQ/hero units can't capture the points, only the normal troops, basically all like company of heroes type gameplay with capture points/building.

[2022-12-11 04:58:59] <%+WastingSanity> @bekindtoeachothr It is pretty good, but there isn't a variety of enemy units.
[2022-12-11 04:59:23] <+inuakurei> Theres only two Paragon projects still alive. Overprime and Predecessor.
[2022-12-11 04:59:24] <%+WastingSanity> or I should say a big variety.
[2022-12-11 04:59:25] <FoolMonty> predecessor seems the most legit

[2022-12-11 04:59:58] <+inuakurei> Predecessor seems the best, but Overprime has way more marketing.

[2022-12-11 08:26:51] <ar_farazon> @DeathShaper It's a decent way to learn the basics. They introduce new units over time so it's not overwhelming.

[2022-12-11 10:09:32] <%+WastingSanity> @mahoraz I think so.. the original devs are no longer the devs for the game

[2022-12-11 10:10:38] <@%CRREAM> I never actually seen this game but i remember the Kickstarter getting a stupid amount of money for it
[2022-12-11 10:10:53] <%Cahl_Phoenix> @Dizy yuaHi silverdawnRave2
[2022-12-11 10:11:04] <Funkenspine> wow has that right
[2022-12-11 10:11:04] <@%jstubbles> It's quite good, Crream. I kickstarted it, played it for years. Still a ton of fun, still being updated.
[2022-12-11 10:11:07] <@%CRREAM> yea they got a few million
[2022-12-11 10:11:18] <%djuice_> Yeah I played this game on release, it was really bad, havent played since.
[2022-12-11 10:11:20] <MrTheBest01> they pissed me off on release
[2022-12-11 10:11:20] <@%CRREAM> They were the Devs that did Super Monday Night Combat
[2022-12-11 10:11:21] <ThyPsychoSeal> think of titans like - Age of mythology Titan - super nuke unit
[2022-12-11 10:11:22] <PistachioIV> The original was bad, yea
[2022-12-11 10:11:27] <mahoraz> it was worse than nomans sky when it released
[2022-12-11 10:11:27] <%Si_Cwan> it did not get any better
[2022-12-11 10:11:28] <@%CRREAM> I loved that game and it just never took off crreamCry
[2022-12-11 10:11:36] <barneeb> Planetary Annihilation had an original which was 'okay' but then they released this which seemed like a cash grab
[2022-12-11 10:11:46] <Dizy> @Cahl_Phoenix  zkiSparkle
[2022-12-11 10:11:52] <MrTheBest01> instead of fixing bugs they released more dlc, kinda scummy
[2022-12-11 10:11:53] <+LancerEcho> People wanted Supreme Commander, and while the planet mechanic is interesting it's actually quite tiresome to control units on a globe imo
[2022-12-11 10:11:56] <FIight_of_Icarus> I just like the fact you can do orbital stuff. Not many RTS games do that. limesSip
[2022-12-11 10:11:56] <Hyper_Remy> Monday night combat was so good BibleThump
[2022-12-11 10:11:56] <%+WastingSanity> @CRREAM I followed it. The devs miss handled the fund and did a pay wall of $90 to get access to it on Steam. Big back lash on Steam. A few years later the devs dipped on the game and then another group took over.

[2022-12-11 10:12:52] <ar_farazon> @WastingSanity The $90 thing was because that was the Kickstarter tier to get the alpha.
[2022-12-11 10:12:57] <+LancerEcho> @WastingSanity yeah and I paid that. Total dissapointment
[2022-12-11 10:13:01] <ViToBius> sometimes the devs get so derpy...like the Long dark qq feelsbadman
[2022-12-11 10:13:10] <%+WastingSanity> @CRREAM It was... when the backlash happened on Steam the Devs were carpet bombing the steam forums with bans. They didn't care who they banned. It was crazy.
[2022-12-11 10:13:11] <KodaiRyu> those who bought OG one got Titans for free :D
[2022-12-11 10:13:24] <KodaiRyu> like when it released
[2022-12-11 10:13:27] <@%CRREAM> @WastingSanity jesus. So they just doubled down on stupid. What a shame
[2022-12-11 10:13:37] <+LancerEcho> At least titans is a good price. "Buy Upgrade to TITANS from Classic Planetary Annihilation Buy this if you own Planetary Annihilation on Steam for a special upgrade price.  2,39€"
[2022-12-11 10:13:37] <%+WastingSanity> @CRREAM Indeed.
[2022-12-11 10:13:44] <@%CRREAM> Well at least a better team took over

[2022-12-11 12:16:24] <dinga15> only thing with anti nukes is that you have to also build the missiles by hand
[2022-12-11 12:16:34] <dymek91> just find barren asteroid on the outskirts and move there  at this point

[2022-12-11 13:13:38] <Swjunke> All factorys have fabbers/engineers, the type can state how effective at building they are

[2022-12-11 13:14:55] <StAult> So. When you select a factory -> 3 dots on the Right side of the screen toolbar can be changed to the Recycling logo (perpetual production).   When you select what you wan to build then it will perpetually make them in the selected ratio.

[2022-12-11 13:32:00] <fridgemakara> oh you're playing galactic war you just don't have air.
[2022-12-11 13:32:13] <Swjunke> Tutorial I think
[2022-12-11 13:32:16] <+Spidersfury> I like the music
[2022-12-11 13:32:28] <Reaper420tn> if you double click a tank factory it should select them all if your zoomed out kinda
[2022-12-11 13:32:33] <SargeARG> expand and cover the south access
[2022-12-11 13:32:37] <fridgemakara> It's kinda funny that galactic war has a reverse difficulty curve. The first battles are the hardest
[2022-12-11 13:32:50] <+n_mandrag> in Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander Builders could support your factories to speed up production. if thats a thing in this - it could help churning out your army faster then you lose it.
[2022-12-11 13:32:52] <fridgemakara> but then you unlock totally busted abilities and instantly win LUL
[2022-12-11 13:33:06] <Swjunke> Galactic war is harder early on when you lack all the buildings

[2022-12-11 13:34:16] <SilenceMonkey_> you can

[2022-12-11 13:37:40] <fridgemakara> btw you might want to do a move order then an attack order, since move orders make all your units keep formation.
[2022-12-11 13:37:43] <+Spidersfury> Did this game intentionally make a "Death Star" on purpose?

[2022-12-11 13:45:53] <+n_mandrag> @ToothlessShark yeah  - but SCs netcode is kinda ancient and even with FAF leaks buckets of memory  in long matches. BAR attempts to fix that.
