[2022-12-22 06:55:32] <%Jmac1434> As far as STDs go, gonorrhea is probably one of the least devastating of the lot. A trip to the doctor, a short round of antibiotics, and some awkward conversations with your partner(s) are the biggest concerns as people don't usually die from gonorrhea. However, around one percent of people who do contract this disease end up with symptoms that can quickly become life threatening - and the results aren't pretty. If you are easily grossed out, be warned, some of the content in this article is gr

[2022-12-22 06:56:18] <Eagle_Will> It’s just antibiotics
[2022-12-22 06:56:34] <%Jmac1434> Chlamydia isn’t directly fatal, but if left untreated, it can lead to a number of serious complications. In women, these complications include inflammation of sexual organs (i.e. cervix, urethra, lining of the uterus, uterus, fallopian tubes, and pelvis), infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Complications in men include urethritis, inflammation of male sexual organs, and infertility.
[2022-12-22 06:57:11] <%Jmac1434> Chlamydia can also make men sterile. It can spread from the urethra to the testicles. Then it can result in a condition called epididymitis. Epididymitis can cause sterility. Symptoms include fever as well as swelling and a variable degree of pain in the scrotum.

[2022-12-22 06:59:48] <%Jmac1434> Can you die from syphilis? Yes, you can. But that’s not the worst part - when syphilis kills, it rarely does so quickly. This particular STD prefers to take its time, weaving its way through your immune system, making your symptoms flair up and disappear, and rarely striking someone the same way twice. While syphilis can deteriorate your brain and internal functions over the course of 10 to 30 years, it’s more likely to give you a body full of ulcers and might even make you go blind. Syphilis, l

[2022-12-22 07:00:48] <%Jmac1434> In later stages of the disease, syphilis has been known to attack all of the vital organs, including the brain. Some victims have been left in a vegetative state, while others - like crime lord Al Capone - suffered the fate of completely losing their personalities and essentially becoming Lenny from Of Mice and Men.

[2022-12-22 07:01:06] <%Jmac1434> Capone contracted syphilis when he was 18, but ignored the disease, allowing it to ravage his body and brain. By the time he was interned at Alcatraz, he was barely the same person who had run one of the largest crime syndicates of the 20th century. Prisoners and workers at the island jail noted that Capone would spend most of his time cowering in his cell and talking to himself like a baby.

[2022-12-22 07:01:18] <%Jmac1434> After he was finally released from prison Capone spent the majority of his final years in an estate near Miami casting a fishing pole into his swimming pool, hoping to catch something. He eventually died from complications related to a brain hemorrhage.

[2022-12-22 08:12:23] <%+SS5_Gogeta> I was looking up lore and why the crossbow had such a big stock. It’s designed to go under the arm while aiming. We we loose a bolt, instead of kickback, the bow pulls us forward

[2022-12-22 08:35:57] <zack_zacky> its gonna be like 55 or something
[2022-12-22 08:35:58] <MeisterMaster2> this is gonna be terrible cause the big one is resistant to strike iirc

[2022-12-22 08:38:37] <theslugman1> shard isn't available until after the fight
[2022-12-22 08:38:38] <+EvilEwok42> it's not going to give you a huge opening
[2022-12-22 08:38:39] <juissiffs> this just needs a dose of perseverance SeemsGood
[2022-12-22 08:38:39] <zack_zacky> and let's not talk about phase 2

[2022-12-22 08:39:34] <%MadKingHyperion> i think he might ahve already moved to farum, so you cant get the weak version
[2022-12-22 08:39:35] <%MeMadeFox> alexander should be in farum azula now I guess
[2022-12-22 08:39:38] <+EvilEwok42> I don't think you can get the weak version anymore, Alexander must already be in Farum
[2022-12-22 08:39:44] <zack_zacky> fat one will just oneshot you
[2022-12-22 08:39:51] <%Android_Saya> yeah Alex is in Farum after Fire Giant is dead
[2022-12-22 08:40:03] <%+c0sm1c04> Yes you have to kill radahn
[2022-12-22 08:40:04] <%Android_Saya> No he's summon for Fire Giant, killing him should move him
[2022-12-22 08:40:05] <+EvilEwok42> I'm not sure

[2022-12-22 08:40:44] <%demonsnyper> Gotta head out, GG on the Fire Giant and best of luck with Duo!

[2022-12-22 08:41:20] <rub357> @Ainrun Does bloodflame blade on main weapon cause kick to trigger bleed?
[2022-12-22 08:41:20] <shklortt> @c0sm1c04 Literally alexander is at festival rn isn’t he
[2022-12-22 08:41:26] <%+c0sm1c04> The festival blocks him
[2022-12-22 08:41:29] <+EvilEwok42> he might still be in Radahn, actually
[2022-12-22 08:41:33] <+EvilEwok42> internet says so
[2022-12-22 08:41:46] <%BigPissser> it does work like that for many ashes of war
[2022-12-22 08:41:55] <%BenderZGreat> small is 10, big 15 I think

[2022-12-22 08:42:29] <+EvilEwok42> might as well try it haha
[2022-12-22 08:42:33] <KikohoSSBM> You can test with blackflame blade pretty quickly
[2022-12-22 08:42:34] <%Android_Saya> I'm pretty sure the entirety of the run left is cancer anyway, maybe Hoarah Loux is the least terrible fight left

[2022-12-22 08:42:57] <+EvilEwok42> i love the Radagon fight

[2022-12-22 08:43:27] <+EvilEwok42> I know that Bushy used blackflame blade in his setting himself on fire run, so it works for incantations at least lol
[2022-12-22 08:43:33] <!%Yojo> bloodflame blade still works with fire's deadly sin so I won't be surprised if it works on kick too
[2022-12-22 08:43:33] <%MeMadeFox> or shortsword

[2022-12-22 08:51:14] <%+SS5_Gogeta> The only bleed I got on my ash was the over time bleed, no initial per kick
[2022-12-22 08:51:15] <%MadKingHyperion> it glows red
[2022-12-22 08:51:26] <%+SS5_Gogeta> So I took 7-8 casts of ash to proxy bleed
[2022-12-22 08:51:32] <%MadKingHyperion> well the target will pop as the bleed builds up

[2022-12-22 08:55:58] <rub357> Bloodflame blade would kinda suck anyway. In order to proc the bleed with it you would need constant aggression

[2022-12-22 09:43:05] <%+calvinicks11> what if you just buffed poise damage or whatever
[2022-12-22 09:43:09] <marrt00> warrior jar shard should increase dmg but maybe not worth cuz you can take shard of alexander later
[2022-12-22 09:43:12] <zack_zacky> but sometimes it isn't which is all the time OKAY
[2022-12-22 09:43:15] <rub357> @hiwago Naah it was pretty clear cut. It is possible that interactions like that were patched out but I don't think so
[2022-12-22 09:43:32] <%+gkingx88> How long did fire giant take
[2022-12-22 09:43:37] <%menumitch> when i tested jar shard it did nothing for kick
[2022-12-22 09:43:43] <%+Kittyhavoc> Lmao, i just read a news article where Putin's best bro claimed that "we should not have let people leave rusisa, instead forced them into prisoners batallion and they would have all died as heroes" Thats what my country wants for its young men - to fucking DIE

[2022-12-22 09:43:47] <+AlwayssSad> 10 more damage when you kick 300 times is worth

[2022-12-22 09:59:21] <+AlwayssSad> you'd have to be kicking at least 25% as often as you were on fire giant to make them sameish
[2022-12-22 09:59:22] <%umbrankh> @obilir1 u fuckin donkey.
[2022-12-22 09:59:23] <%+c0sm1c04> And kill radahn xD
[2022-12-22 09:59:24] <%+EvilEwok42> wait does kicking cost mana???
[2022-12-22 09:59:34] <%Wanjeon> dancer charm damage is probably tanked by the weight of the shield no? not sure if you have something better to use tho
[2022-12-22 09:59:36] <AzaZ_ow> long term buffs is the play and it's not like you have infinite FP
[2022-12-22 09:59:38] <+gleefulgm> @obilir1 ???
[2022-12-22 09:59:40] <eladidu3> are you allowing parries?

[2022-12-22 09:59:43] <+Davood061> u can use radagon's icon to extend it a little bit
[2022-12-22 09:59:52] <%IGotSacked> is it?
[2022-12-22 09:59:56] <%+c0sm1c04> Golden vow aow maybe helps?
[2022-12-22 10:00:01] <AzaZ_ow> gino at least had riposte so he can regen hard with the daggers

[2022-12-22 10:02:05] <eladidu3> just don't fail once and it will barely take half a stream OKAY
[2022-12-22 10:02:08] <$CheeseburgerChad> Waterfowl skip would be fine honestly
[2022-12-22 10:02:17] <QuaDruPleQuaKe> i'd defo consider to just skip

[2022-12-22 10:06:47] <%umbrankh> mimic can punch them so invalid
[2022-12-22 10:06:48] <eladidu3> does having sleep grease apply to the kick?

[2022-12-22 10:07:20] <%+c0sm1c04> Could use st trina aow
[2022-12-22 10:07:24] <KikohoSSBM> Sword of st. trina maybe
[2022-12-22 10:07:26] <eladidu3> technically not
[2022-12-22 10:07:28] <+TheLeviathong> The average souls streamer spends 5% of his life on the toilet, and 15% of his life kicking Godskin duo
[2022-12-22 10:07:29] <KikohoSSBM> I don't think the mist does
[2022-12-22 10:07:31] <+AlwayssSad> no but it costs a lot
[2022-12-22 10:07:33] <%+c0sm1c04> No
[2022-12-22 10:07:34] <eladidu3> but the build up on the cloud is ery low
[2022-12-22 10:07:38] <%IGotSacked> it doesnt do dmg
[2022-12-22 10:07:39] <%menumitch> mist is ass
[2022-12-22 10:07:39] <+gleefulgm> Noo as long you don’t hit them with the swing
[2022-12-22 10:07:41] <KikohoSSBM> 20 fp per cast though
[2022-12-22 10:07:43] <%+c0sm1c04> But its pretty bad just the aow
[2022-12-22 10:07:44] <+AlwayssSad> the mist sucks
[2022-12-22 10:07:46] <AzaZ_ow> you can hit with the sword on the weapon art
[2022-12-22 10:07:47] <+Davood061> u can always cheat in 99 mind lol
[2022-12-22 10:07:47] <FelidaeSocialis> the slash during AoW does damage but the mist doesn't
[2022-12-22 10:07:59] <chefboyerdeee> starlight shards too
[2022-12-22 10:07:59] <%+c0sm1c04> The mist is ass you have to hit them with it to be effective
[2022-12-22 10:08:06] <eladidu3> you could riposte with the fp refill on crit
[2022-12-22 10:08:08] <+AlwayssSad> nah cause one mist does nit sleep them I don't think
[2022-12-22 10:08:09] <KikohoSSBM> Carian filligreed crest helps too
[2022-12-22 10:08:12] <eladidu3> up to 6 times
[2022-12-22 10:08:13] <%+c0sm1c04> Yeah but you wont sleep them with one mist
[2022-12-22 10:08:16] <AzaZ_ow> I think it's capped
[2022-12-22 10:08:21] <FelidaeSocialis> no only 3 - 4 times

[2022-12-22 10:08:29] <+AlwayssSad> @eladidu3 no he can't cause then it wouldn't be a kick only run

[2022-12-22 10:08:49] <+gleefulgm> You need two mist to sleep them
[2022-12-22 10:08:51] <deamzer> theorycrafting this fight is making the actual attempt go by. Look you're already like 1/20th of the way there
[2022-12-22 10:08:59] <KikohoSSBM> You need to do Darwill and talk to Blaidd

[2022-12-22 10:09:12] <AzaZ_ow> you would rather use beastial vitality
[2022-12-22 10:09:21] <FelidaeSocialis> Mist is honestly very bad tho

[2022-12-22 10:11:20] <%+c0sm1c04> Yeah
[2022-12-22 10:11:22] <+AlwayssSad> tfw ain is using one of my fav weapons but he's gonna hate it nyannStrong
[2022-12-22 10:11:22] <!%dinossindgeil> hi lobosWut
[2022-12-22 10:11:22] <%+c0sm1c04> Down there
[2022-12-22 10:11:24] <+Davood061> farming isnt a skill issue
[2022-12-22 10:11:24] <AzaZ_ow> do you have a stone sword?
[2022-12-22 10:11:24] <%+SS5_Gogeta> 99 all stats. Just farm 1.5 billion runes. PogChamp
[2022-12-22 10:11:27] <FelidaeSocialis> Yes very low
[2022-12-22 10:11:28] <eladidu3> very much so
[2022-12-22 10:11:35] <+gleefulgm> You mean farm *wink* *wink*
[2022-12-22 10:11:36] <+Davood061> just go test it
[2022-12-22 10:11:39] <+AlwayssSad> no, it applies sleep to the blade itself
[2022-12-22 10:11:39] <%+c0sm1c04> But you need 2 stoneswords
[2022-12-22 10:11:43] <pink_noizz> try it maybe
[2022-12-22 10:11:48] <%+c0sm1c04> Its in the ruins down there

[2022-12-22 10:12:04] <$yharnam_babyface> nice sweater, love that color
[2022-12-22 10:12:08] <+AlwayssSad> the mist is pretty bad cause the game assumes you also use the sword with it
[2022-12-22 10:12:17] <%+c0sm1c04> But ad we said the mist is really shit
[2022-12-22 10:12:20] <%+c0sm1c04> It wont sleep them
[2022-12-22 10:12:31] <%+c0sm1c04> You have to hit them with it to be effective

[2022-12-22 10:13:16] <%hiwago> who ever said arcance for sleep build up is just half right. the sword scales with int, torch with faith and pots with arcane

[2022-12-22 10:13:22] <+gleefulgm> Mic def throws rocks

[2022-12-22 10:13:41] <%hiwago> no?
[2022-12-22 10:13:48] <Krappa_1_2_3> only pot I believe
[2022-12-22 10:13:49] <eladidu3> the buildup is only affected by arcane if the source is
[2022-12-22 10:13:50] <+AlwayssSad> pretty sure buildup is only affected if thr weapon scales with arcane
[2022-12-22 10:13:54] <LamiiBunny> Arcane is status buildup in general
[2022-12-22 10:13:59] <%hiwago> @AlwayssSad this
[2022-12-22 10:13:59] <eladidu3> the sword has no arcane scaling so no buildup scaling
[2022-12-22 10:14:03] <LamiiBunny> but only if the source scales with Arcane
[2022-12-22 10:14:07] <%hiwago> @LamiiBunny false
[2022-12-22 10:14:16] <%hiwago> ye now its more correct
[2022-12-22 10:14:20] <+Davood061> can u infuse the sword to be occult?
[2022-12-22 10:14:20] <RexVeritas> ainnDUMPER
[2022-12-22 10:14:27] <+Zimmerheiler> arcane should affect it tho

[2022-12-22 10:33:13] <+paipai314> no when the mountain just below the compass that's when you jump
[2022-12-22 10:33:13] <+Davood061> the whole point of the mountain is to help u time the jump right before the camera angle chagnes lol

[2022-12-22 10:40:53] <%amazingballs1> maybe hes a nordic? huh? you ever consider that he likes this weather?

[2022-12-22 12:55:55] <Amerrr> Just made an interesting discovery, kicking with the briar greaves equipped does more damage.

[2022-12-22 12:56:28] <li0n_of_war> I mean rolling with that armour set does damage I believe
[2022-12-22 12:56:30] <@%+ATONAT_> Surely that’s because you get close enough to spike them with the passive?
[2022-12-22 12:56:34] <GnawGut> wat
[2022-12-22 12:56:40] <GnawGut> thats huge
[2022-12-22 12:56:44] <Amerrr> no rolling just kicking
[2022-12-22 12:56:44] <%hiwago> so its basically a 100% increase?
[2022-12-22 12:56:46] <%Flynchie> is it testing time

[2022-12-22 14:16:26] <@%ArhamSAA> it is a bug, in the sheet it says if IsAddBaseAtk flag is true, the ash of war isn't supposed to use the weapon's AR, there are separate attack values for those ash of wars and kick only has physical atk in that column
[2022-12-22 14:16:27] <Kunivaaaa> It's a christmas miracle

[2022-12-22 14:19:17] <@%ArhamSAA> @ATONAT_ some ash of wars use the weapon AR, some ash of wars have a fixed value in a specific damage type so they aren't affected by affinities. Kick is supposed to only use the fixed attack value which is only physical, all other damage types are 0.

[2022-12-22 14:36:22] <jstamper420> That’s like .5 weight isn’t it
[2022-12-22 14:36:25] <+ElisaTheCursed> yea, duelist great axe has highest base holy damage with infustion
[2022-12-22 14:36:34] <%hiwago> the waki does not have base holy dmg
[2022-12-22 14:36:40] <%oldmonk_97> @hiwago cuz holy dmg is based OKAY
[2022-12-22 14:36:44] <%angry_mobman> theyre assuming the sacred infusion
[2022-12-22 14:36:45] <%hiwago> OKAY
[2022-12-22 14:37:15] <%$scribblesofa> Base is different than affinity base
[2022-12-22 14:37:16] <%hiwago> but i guess that is true, with the sacred affinity it becomes base holy dmg Pepega
[2022-12-22 14:37:19] <%Simbon> has soft caps at 8, 16 and 20 equip load. -Fextra
[2022-12-22 14:37:45] <%$scribblesofa> Sacred gives holy dmg, base means it already had it

[2022-12-22 14:38:23] <%hiwago> ye thats how i thought it was too @scribblesofa
[2022-12-22 14:38:31] <+AlwayssSad> i can ask fextra
[2022-12-22 14:38:51] <Harmonixer123> @scribblesofa no, base is the default amount, scaled damage is the added damage to it from stats, innate is the word for what you are talking about
[2022-12-22 14:38:52] <%$scribblesofa> @hiwago I agree, that’s the way it seems the bug works
[2022-12-22 14:38:58] <V2turtlezs> 8lbs should be about 15%  16lb should be 12%  20lb should be 8%
[2022-12-22 14:39:02] <FelidaeSocialis> I can look for a weapon under certain weight
[2022-12-22 14:39:21] <ixevix> why do you need ritual shield ?
[2022-12-22 14:39:31] <@%+ATONAT_> apparently blue dancer does more damage buff on lower weapon level - is weapon level critical for kick damage too?
[2022-12-22 14:39:33] <shues> isnt 12 the same as sacred scorpio ncharm
[2022-12-22 14:40:00] VIEWERS: 669
[2022-12-22 14:40:04] <ixevix> might be better to just have nothing
[2022-12-22 14:40:08] <jstamper420> The wiki says blue dancer only affects physical scaling damage, so is it really doing that much?
[2022-12-22 14:40:15] <+AlwayssSad> yes
[2022-12-22 14:40:30] <@%+ATONAT_> it seems the issue with blue dancer is the percentage varies on more factors than equip load - allegedly it affects lighter weapons more than heavier weapons at the same equip load
[2022-12-22 14:40:34] <%hiwago> @ATONAT_ wait that info seems weird
[2022-12-22 14:40:37] <WhatSeekethThee> !KICK

[2022-12-22 14:40:39] <%$scribblesofa> Weapon level may affect holy bug too
[2022-12-22 14:40:43] <%hiwago> @ATONAT_ but ye, weapon lvls is the main scaling of kicks
[2022-12-22 14:40:46] <WhatSeekethThee> ouch
[2022-12-22 14:41:01] <jstamper420> I was gonna say I feel like even under 8 equip load I keep doing more damage
[2022-12-22 14:41:05] <jstamper420> That’s a weird one
[2022-12-22 14:41:25] <%$scribblesofa> 12% from BDC without the debuff from scorpion sounds better
[2022-12-22 14:41:27] <V2turtlezs> @jstamper420 because it goes to 0lb 20% buff
[2022-12-22 14:41:29] <sigbro> buffing physical vs holy damage right with the different talismans

[2022-12-22 14:43:12] <%hiwago> i feel like thinking deeper into it wont do much. the holy part is clearly bugged

[2022-12-22 14:43:23] <ixevix> does the physick that breaks poise faster work?

[2022-12-22 14:44:41] <+ElisaTheCursed> it adds unscaled damage so maybe
