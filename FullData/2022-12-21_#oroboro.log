[2022-12-21 23:52:17] <+MarauderKnight3> 99 vigor is cute :)
[2022-12-21 23:52:27] <!%Ebonslayer> @MarauderKnight3 I don't think you can put it on daggers.
[2022-12-21 23:52:27] <hugostefaniv> @elijahkaty not for STR, since you can 2-hand for 1.5x stats
[2022-12-21 23:52:35] <%+drunkpandal0l> is this dart?

[2022-12-21 23:53:14] <%madbrit77> I don't think poise matters if you have a heavier weapon
[2022-12-21 23:53:17] <CHOCOlot_> @Hulken_Hurricane over 80 to avoid thrusting sword bs, Jeenine made a whole ass guide for it

[2022-12-21 23:55:12] <TheKoop> Hey @Oroboro how's it going today? I feel like i've never been this early.
[2022-12-21 23:55:14] <MordecaiWanng> I had 133 poise and was still getting staggered like I was wearing paper towels
[2022-12-21 23:55:26] <%$Illuna_Meira> I love Zelda so much thinking about her makes me happy thanks for looking after her

[2022-12-21 23:55:50] <+pdhNaz> Just the bg Talisman
[2022-12-21 23:55:50] <hugostefaniv> Most jump strong attacks deal >133 poise damage now
[2022-12-21 23:55:54] <Marshmallum> the talisman helps a lot
[2022-12-21 23:56:06] <$ElijahKaty> Wish they had more knightly looking armor that wasn’t super lame
[2022-12-21 23:56:13] <+dahake12> first playthrough?
[2022-12-21 23:56:16] <pikselonix> alright thanks
[2022-12-21 23:56:24] <+pdhNaz> And really 101 is only necessary if you want to tank crutch stomp and flaming strike, for anything else you can go lower
[2022-12-21 23:56:25] <vGhastt> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-21 23:56:32] <val_draconis> @hugostefaniv dagger heavy jump attacks do more then 133 too which is amusing as hell

[2022-12-21 23:57:11] <%Evil_on_Paper> Did you know that you can get a very strong spell by killing a dragon? It's called rot breath and it's the strongest :) I thought you'd like to know since it's your first playthroguh and you're using something silly like lightning.
[2022-12-21 23:57:11] <rostislavoskolkov> So if Genshin had....
[2022-12-21 23:57:12] <val_draconis> imagine full bullgoats only to be staggered by a single onehanded dagger jump attack
[2022-12-21 23:57:13] <+pdhNaz> Wo Long has invasions? Damn it’s even better than I thought
