[2022-12-12 15:18:23] <persi_enne> Not taking a firm stand is the most chaotic I guess
[2022-12-12 15:18:30] <+turboskeeter> Chaos is subjective. What seems bad at the time can end well for more, just in an unstructured way where choices don't always make logical sense
[2022-12-12 15:18:35] <%BowlingBobby> It's because it's not really bad per se, the whole route split really meant Lawful Good and Chaotic Good, which are alignments.
[2022-12-12 15:18:37] <@%Laww__> elmoFire  chaos can be good i think ? kinda ? maybe ?
[2022-12-12 15:19:03] <%BowlingBobby> You see, Lawful Neutral and Chaotic are the alignments and you get put in between them depending on the choices you made

[2022-12-12 15:19:29] <+turboskeeter> Galgastan hate the Bakram. They sought an ethnic cleansing of the land.
[2022-12-12 15:20:11] <%ThermiThorus> i dunno if you have, but did you watch the video that plays when you don't do anything in the main menu? cuz it tells you the backstory
[2022-12-12 15:20:11] <+turboskeeter> They're just people that want their own land/nation.
[2022-12-12 15:20:19] <%BowlingBobby> Basically you, Walister, are in a civil war with the Galgastani on your lands. Think of it as Palestine and Israel. Now, there's also the Bakram which are a third party nation who is also at war with both of you.
[2022-12-12 15:20:21] <persi_enne> I think the idea is that law, chaos, neutral  all involve death of innocents, and good people on the opposite side. None is completely 'good' really
[2022-12-12 15:20:25] <%ThermiThorus> KEKW
[2022-12-12 15:20:31] <persi_enne> It's war

[2022-12-12 15:20:55] <%Raikyr_> I'm awake now
[2022-12-12 15:20:59] <%BowlingBobby> Right now, you are basically executing what remains of the Galgastan force instead of uniting them all under one banner.

[2022-12-12 15:23:16] <%BowlingBobby> In the beginning, you Vyce and Catiua wanted to get back at the Galgastani for oppressing your Walister people. So then you rescue Duke Ronwey, but then Duke Ronwey was like "pwease kill all these old people for the cause" and you decided you didn't want any of that, so you defected.

[2022-12-12 15:43:42] <%netouyo> salve has higher RT tho
[2022-12-12 15:43:46] <%BowlingBobby> You think Stal has time to spend her riches?
[2022-12-12 15:43:51] <%BowlingBobby> SHE'S RICH EZ
[2022-12-12 15:44:00] <%Raikyr_> To be fair, it might be better to salve
[2022-12-12 15:44:07] <%Raikyr_> you have 700 max HP on most units

[2022-12-12 15:45:02] <%Raikyr_> I think the difference is like using a High Potion and Max Potion in FF

[2022-12-12 16:22:04] <%bellcross321> you can do cyno/kuki/collei/nahida/traveler(whoever you have)
[2022-12-12 16:22:15] <%bellcross321> not saying you cant use him in other teams
[2022-12-12 16:22:21] <%bellcross321> but he shines mostly with dendro
[2022-12-12 16:23:16] <%bellcross321> oh with yaoyao coming
[2022-12-12 16:23:26] <%bellcross321> she'll most likely be a dendro healer

[2022-12-12 16:53:34] <%ReizzaLyn> Nahida main stat is Elem Mastery. Then Crits

[2022-12-12 16:53:38] <%bellcross321> full EM nahida is fine
[2022-12-12 16:53:51] <%TW_ShiaoPi> in your team you definitely want full EM nahida I think
[2022-12-12 16:53:53] <%SkibolPatryk> 1000 EM Nahida WICKED
[2022-12-12 16:53:58] <%TW_ShiaoPi> since she is triggering all the blooms
[2022-12-12 16:54:02] <%Baricuga> unfortunately EM sands is a grind
[2022-12-12 16:54:06] <%ReizzaLyn> Recommended Nahida Elem is 800+. 1000 is best
[2022-12-12 16:54:10] <%MoistHeinous> @Nomokuto this a good link NODDERS they all reference keqing mains website
[2022-12-12 16:54:57] <%SkibolPatryk> you want EM on everything basically NODDERS
[2022-12-12 16:54:58] <%MoistHeinous> just need main stat em artifacts

[2022-12-12 16:55:21] <ChotoMatte> it takes months to get a good set so its okay

[2022-12-12 16:55:41] <%SkibolPatryk> the good side of EM build is you don't really care that much about other stats NODDERS
[2022-12-12 16:55:45] <%Baricuga> you can never get mainstat EM on feather and flower
[2022-12-12 16:55:51] <%coldsadcat> stalalaNotes
[2022-12-12 16:56:01] <%ReizzaLyn> EM Sands, Goblet, Circlet gives 150+ each I think
[2022-12-12 16:56:04] <%davecryo> just do some on max lvl youll get them COPIUM
[2022-12-12 16:56:04] <%MoistHeinous> but you have 4 piece dendro set at least
[2022-12-12 16:56:18] <Tuturruu_> Yea farming a full EM set took me like 2-3 weeks doing only weeklies and that domain lol

[2022-12-12 16:58:38] <%Baricuga> whats your off set piece?
[2022-12-12 16:58:52] <%Brruhv> That def one is actually just 2 roles
[2022-12-12 16:58:55] <%ReizzaLyn> Yeah up grade that. Just teplace if you get a better piece
[2022-12-12 16:58:55] <%Baricuga> so you have 4 piece dendro
[2022-12-12 16:58:57] <%bellcross321> off piece means a different piece from another set
[2022-12-12 16:59:11] <%bellcross321> you have 4 deepwood pieces
[2022-12-12 16:59:12] <+Rayswo> KEKL
[2022-12-12 16:59:23] <%MoistHeinous> you have 4 piece to get set bonus and a free 5th slot to use whatever.
[2022-12-12 16:59:26] <%Baricuga> but you have one piece that isnt dendro probably, its usually chalice
[2022-12-12 16:59:31] <%ReizzaLyn> Pray everything goes to EM and crit
[2022-12-12 16:59:31] <%bellcross321> you can have 1 off piece as in from a different set but has the values you need

[2022-12-12 16:59:54] <%bellcross321> its 1 roll into defence
[2022-12-12 17:00:03] <%Nomokuto> One day we get a dendro who needs def YEP
[2022-12-12 17:00:03] <%bellcross321> its still got a chance
[2022-12-12 17:00:07] <%MoistHeinous> lol
[2022-12-12 17:00:13] <%MoistHeinous> its a decent piece tho

[2022-12-12 17:00:30] <%Baricuga> chalice is usually a preferred pick because it can roll all elemental bonuses
[2022-12-12 17:00:31] <%bellcross321> 20
[2022-12-12 17:00:32] <%SkibolPatryk> level the one with EM

[2022-12-12 17:00:39] <%zokok__> 20 it stalalaSwole
[2022-12-12 17:00:40] <%MoistHeinous> how many rolls is 13% defense?
[2022-12-12 17:00:41] <%Brruhv> that other one can wait
[2022-12-12 17:00:42] <%Baricuga> although i think you want EM regardless
[2022-12-12 17:00:59] <%Baricuga> im probably confusing you, sorry .-.
[2022-12-12 17:01:04] <%ReizzaLyn> wow thats a nice feather

[2022-12-12 17:01:46] <%Baricuga> do you have any mainstat EM chalices? unlikely but would be worth
[2022-12-12 17:01:49] <%ReizzaLyn> You can upgrade the other one to 16 and see the stats and compare
[2022-12-12 17:01:57] <%Brruhv> on field crit better
[2022-12-12 17:01:57] <%MoistHeinous> My artifacts are very bad but i just have main stat EM which works

[2022-12-12 17:02:40] <%Brruhv> It has em
[2022-12-12 17:02:42] <%davecryo> those ones
[2022-12-12 17:02:52] <%Baricuga> tbh i would just rock the EM main stat one you have for now
[2022-12-12 17:02:53] <%davecryo> lvl them big em
[2022-12-12 17:02:54] <%SkibolPatryk> for off field Nahida the only stat that matters is EM
[2022-12-12 17:02:56] <%ReizzaLyn> Dendro Bonus better if you want Nahida on field
[2022-12-12 17:03:02] <%Baricuga> unless you have a god roll on your current
[2022-12-12 17:03:16] <%Brruhv> Dendro bonus hits harder
[2022-12-12 17:03:25] <%MoistHeinous> you can use it on someone else. Nahida just needs EM
