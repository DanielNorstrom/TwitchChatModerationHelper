[2023-01-04 00:49:57] <danmaxgamer> Warrior has no chance against druid
[2023-01-04 00:50:10] <너의학창시절친구지우 (yourchildhoodfriendash)> why do druid,rogue and dh get to play 5 more manas than you each turn it doesnt seem fair :(
[2023-01-04 00:50:17] <+Malwontae> we had a chance if Brann was pulled at some stage
[2023-01-04 00:50:30] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @danmaxgamer yeah, but druid has hardly any chance against miracle rogue and boon priest, so that's that....
[2023-01-04 00:51:05] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> theotar was prolly a little to early...

[2023-01-04 02:34:34] <Barsolar> both cheat mana
[2023-01-04 02:35:13] <Barsolar> probably back to druidstone
[2023-01-04 02:35:20] <%playingdirty> jackpot rogues and druids probably
