[2022-12-27 18:29:54] <%+wootlybear> just use the favorite icon..it chooses for you
[2022-12-27 18:29:58] <StartlingTulip2> use summon favorite mount itll always use dragon over teh normal

[2022-12-27 18:30:01] <cumprovider> You dont need a macro for it. Just set your favorite mount.
[2022-12-27 18:30:02] <Cycore> the easiest thing to do is use the favorite mount button and favrotie a dragon riding mount and a ground mount @Naowh
