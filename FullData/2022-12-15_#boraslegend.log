[2022-12-15 17:14:36] <%FarmerManBill> gvardiol is probably only croatia player
[2022-12-15 17:14:39] <carneirozxc> santos was fired from portugal, finally lmao
[2022-12-15 17:14:52] <davidnizzy> I might cry tears of joy if I get to see Messi lift the trophy sunday
[2022-12-15 17:14:53] <alluuuup> lukaku😀😀😀
[2022-12-15 17:14:54] <ma1lb0t> Gvardiol
[2022-12-15 17:14:57] <streamingontwitchtoday> @erling_braut Alright mate, but forwards will be Messi, Mbappe and Gakpo, mark my words
[2022-12-15 17:15:09] <+jonte8877> Henderson 90 rated vamosNuke
[2022-12-15 17:15:12] <%FarmerManBill> perisic is so complete as a player
[2022-12-15 17:15:19] <jorencr> someone from japan maybe? Tagliafico was class against croatia
[2022-12-15 17:15:21] <Flukeykieran999> Perisic would look better if he had someone other than Kramaric to feed into
[2022-12-15 17:15:35] <streamingontwitchtoday> @farmermanbill only he couldnt do anything against argentina
[2022-12-15 17:15:38] <@%badnewsbasterd> Perisic the most COMPLETED player in modern football
[2022-12-15 17:15:39] <dackeea> Im disapointed with ronaldo tbh
[2022-12-15 17:15:39] <Mir4cle101> Perisic was also a volleyball player wowowow

[2022-12-15 17:16:06] <+jonte8877> PEPE?
[2022-12-15 17:16:14] <%martial__arzt> he was so good for bayern in 2020 Perisic
[2022-12-15 17:16:18] <%+RandoCide> Woras
[2022-12-15 17:16:19] <OfficialMidi> @badnewsbasterd Valverde is getting there also
[2022-12-15 17:16:37] <%+RandoCide> Crush his dreams
[2022-12-15 17:16:42] <davidnizzy> butirisit for this guy
[2022-12-15 17:16:52] <%FarmerManBill> no lol
[2022-12-15 17:16:55] <streamingontwitchtoday> @farmermanbill Yeah, unfortunate. Im from the Netherlands, but was for Argentina since the start. I want Messi to immortilize himself with winning the WC.
[2022-12-15 17:16:55] <HashtagLegion> Boras the hope destroyer
[2022-12-15 17:16:55] <%wokeAholic> mcguire

[2022-12-15 17:17:12] <%FarmerManBill> probably will be foden bellingham
[2022-12-15 17:17:14] <streamingontwitchtoday> @wokeaholic Yes fs
[2022-12-15 17:17:19] <xJaneI> Can potm Messi play lf in 4321? Or to slow?
[2022-12-15 17:17:25] <sqeetvfx> No mods
[2022-12-15 17:17:30] <%+Franchise1324> Casemiro should take one of the midfield spots for sure
[2022-12-15 17:17:34] <Mir4cle101> maguire deserves TOTT card after that performance
[2022-12-15 17:17:36] <pedromsa10> Foden getting a TOTT card is just sad tbh. He was good, but there were better players, especially from england
[2022-12-15 17:17:40] <streamingontwitchtoday> @xjanei LCM yeah he can
[2022-12-15 17:17:43] <sqeetvfx> You need new mods botas
