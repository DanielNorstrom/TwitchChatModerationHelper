[2022-12-31 14:10:30] <@sorarejosh> cr7 rare ¬£400 , imagine sorare begin covering that league...
[2022-12-31 14:10:31] <%+nathjasper95> When did they release the 500k pack again ü§£
[2022-12-31 14:10:33] <%theJFKexperience0> If you say you wouldn‚Äôt do what he did you‚Äôre just plain dumb and lying. If you can make generational wealth for your family you do it immediately.
[2022-12-31 14:10:39] <blazer33x> he chose money
[2022-12-31 14:10:39] <+georgescfc2021> I‚Äôd take him at stoke we need a striker
[2022-12-31 14:10:45] <blazer33x> it didnt have to be

[2022-12-31 14:10:57] <%+kingnovakin> He said he wouldn't go to saudi league, but apart from that what he has done is not uncommon by any means
[2022-12-31 14:10:58] <%+jsarrami> a little less finished in MLS, fully finished in Saudi
[2022-12-31 14:10:58] <69tw> @Craigie182 why not? Toty is like 25 days away, if you open them now you ll probably have even more packs by then

[2022-12-31 14:11:05] <%+jezzatee2x> This is the only way he has a chance to go to the 2026 WC even as a bench player. It‚Äôll allow him to rest and recover

[2022-12-31 14:13:13] <%+oIo_NIRVANA_oIo> of course they count
[2022-12-31 14:13:16] <+braveheartsaad> The league level is not as low as you think
[2022-12-31 14:13:19] <thethirdkey3> it's the equivalent of grass roots football
[2022-12-31 14:13:20] <vRandell> He won‚Äôt score goal after goal
[2022-12-31 14:13:20] <%theJFKexperience0> No one will ever take the ‚Äúmr champions league‚Äù title from him Ronaldo is one of the most clutch players in the history of the sport
[2022-12-31 14:13:21] <%+michael2ooo> It‚Äôs still professional football
[2022-12-31 14:13:23] <spask39> they litterally count LUL
[2022-12-31 14:13:26] <Fuzzyjambo31> he wont get hounded by the media as much as he has in this country and thats prob what he wants
[2022-12-31 14:13:30] <69tw> @Craigie182 there will be a new promo on friday. If you dont like the promo cards right now, yea  open them in 5 days
[2022-12-31 14:13:31] <harlam03akaaaron> goals are goals.. professional league
[2022-12-31 14:13:33] <henry428> the league is a decent level
[2022-12-31 14:13:34] <%theJFKexperience0> Ronaldo is firmly #2 best ever to do it
[2022-12-31 14:13:38] <+aarona93> peles goals against farmers counted though
[2022-12-31 14:13:39] <+BYCakes> I mean he should, but there has been loads of examples of older players going to an "easy" league and just phoning it in and not delivering
[2022-12-31 14:13:39] <+georgescfc2021> Can only score against what‚Äôs in frony
[2022-12-31 14:13:40] <vRandell> Let‚Äôs not pretend Cristiano is still elite
[2022-12-31 14:13:43] <zedenzidane> if thats his logic then pele goals dont count
[2022-12-31 14:13:44] <+TurtlesHeadsPopinOut> they're still his career goals no matter the league
[2022-12-31 14:13:47] <notsushirl> he may end up being absolutely pocketed by the random 85 rated CB we all pack during TOTS
[2022-12-31 14:13:49] <blazer33x> its not even championship level
[2022-12-31 14:13:52] <+braveheartsaad> I‚Äôd say almost same level as EFL
[2022-12-31 14:13:52] <+Craigie182> thanks for the help @69tw :)
[2022-12-31 14:14:09] <%+peterlcfc> put it this way, Pele never played at a big club, do his goals not count?
[2022-12-31 14:14:16] <Naetep> ronaldo is spreading football across the globe.
[2022-12-31 14:14:16] <%theJFKexperience0> Ronaldo isn‚Äôt elite but he‚Äôs still better than everyone in that league
[2022-12-31 14:14:16] <MBale93> Ronaldo about to be fodder on Ea 24 üòÇ
[2022-12-31 14:14:24] <thethirdkey3> but their not one of the top 5 players of all time still at a high level
[2022-12-31 14:14:26] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> It‚Äôs still professional football he‚Äôs being paid a full time wage .. look it up
[2022-12-31 14:14:30] <tony202300> He‚Äôs gone there for a payday!! He said he wanted to play at high level. Good on him
[2022-12-31 14:14:30] <%+Liamthe3rd> guess Pele never scored a goal in his life then
[2022-12-31 14:14:31] <+georgescfc2021> Blazers getting on it early for New Years
[2022-12-31 14:14:31] <%+oIo_NIRVANA_oIo> yes rhe teams he'll play against aren't good but neither is El Nessr, all evens out

[2022-12-31 14:14:37] <vRandell> @peterlcfc Santos were absolutely huge in that era
[2022-12-31 14:14:38] <+braveheartsaad> You guys saw the Saudi national team in the world cup, most of them don‚Äôt even start for their teams!
[2022-12-31 14:14:39] <easternmantis10> Yes he did @peterlcfc
[2022-12-31 14:14:41] <ryanb2717> people find it hard to be open minded thats what's good about nep he looks at it from both sides
[2022-12-31 14:14:44] <BusFares> Not played the WL in a couple months. How come it feels so much easier now? I guess becuase the rewards were nerfed right?

[2022-12-31 14:15:53] <Naetep> the ronaldo hate has made me feel different about the sport. the same happened with the super league stuff

[2022-12-31 14:15:57] <callumlord15> have the best of players been taken out of packs ?
[2022-12-31 14:15:57] <vRandell> Everyone was saying Cristiano had the physique has someone 10 years younger than him
[2022-12-31 14:16:00] <@%AaronBrookes94> I think a lot more people started hating Ronaldo because of how he left Manchester United. Now it does seem that the Glazers wasn't letting him leave so that was the only way for him to get out
[2022-12-31 14:16:01] <%+peterlcfc> in a pretty average league

[2022-12-31 14:16:09] <adriantheimert> Lets be honest most of us thought Ronaldo would retire by now
[2022-12-31 14:16:14] <notsushirl> Cafu was pocketing ronaldo at 38
[2022-12-31 14:16:15] <%DodzRD> ronaldo could definitly still play at a good standered in the right team.

[2022-12-31 14:16:26] <MBale93> Do you think ronaldo could ball out for a couple years and then maybe come back to Europe like ibra ?
[2022-12-31 14:16:38] <dizzydukc> ronaldo is a super sub unfurtunaly
[2022-12-31 14:16:38] <Naetep> how can you go to the prem and score 25 goals and then suddenly you are not good enough
[2022-12-31 14:16:44] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Ronaldo has been a fantastic servant to football and he don‚Äôt owe no one nothing the same as messi ..at this time he should be allowed if wanted to make his final days a secure one

[2022-12-31 14:20:22] <%+fistyanan> the difference is nep, theres always been a divide in the two players - ronaldo and messi, and this is because theyve been in a league of their owns for 20 odd years. the reason the others dont get slated is because they havent had that intense battle of being the greatest of all time through out the whole career. now people are seeing his decline. and messi winning a world cup, its just caused people to be more toxic.
[2022-12-31 14:20:25] <%+kingnovakin> I remember he got off to a stinker in 17/18 but he pulled it back later in the season
[2022-12-31 14:20:31] <69tw> @ams_s but its true. A lot of people hate him because he gets a lot of money. Plus would he say that he looks like shit? And as i said he just wanted to be the best
[2022-12-31 14:20:32] <%$istreet98> its crazy how 44 is a drop off, people forget that
[2022-12-31 14:20:35] <+tonyyysnow> he also paid a women for her silence..
[2022-12-31 14:20:35] <majy786> he scored 24 last szn
[2022-12-31 14:20:45] <%+peterlcfc> take Mbappe and Haaland out the picture and he's still one of the greatest players currently
[2022-12-31 14:20:50] <c1dotloose> You judge how good a player is by their numbers ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-12-31 14:20:55] <Naetep> he scored 24 goals while playing in the prem
[2022-12-31 14:21:01] <%+peterlcfc> how else should you judge
[2022-12-31 14:21:03] VIEWERS: 854
[2022-12-31 14:21:07] <thejoker394> Mbappe barely gets 40 goals a season
[2022-12-31 14:21:09] <%adamryan_10> I‚Äôm not a fan of Ronaldo but it‚Äôs mental to say his career was declining after scoring 44 goals in a season
[2022-12-31 14:21:10] <%+rbuckley98> 24 in 38 was a cracking season in context of how poor utd were
[2022-12-31 14:21:11] <adriantheimert> He didnt play away games in the league as often last 2 season in Madrid, Zidane saved him for Home games and champions league
[2022-12-31 14:21:11] <abuhajar_313> Cr7 is milking $$$
[2022-12-31 14:21:15] <Naetep> top strikers in the prem right now cant get 24 goals for their club
[2022-12-31 14:21:15] <Deaaan_v2> stats are facts
[2022-12-31 14:21:25] <%+peterlcfc> facts are stats
[2022-12-31 14:21:25] <%+Xd_killzz> im fully behind everything your saying right now
[2022-12-31 14:21:25] <MuratElmaz__> Good afternoon sir, I'm in the car on my way to Brighton. I will be in the Arsenal end, what are your thoughts on the scoreline, reckon we can do it? I'm going 2-0 Arsenal. COYG
[2022-12-31 14:21:31] <+Lowkeysic> @tonyyysnow if you believe the media...
[2022-12-31 14:21:32] <%+kingnovakin> if you listen, neppo isn't doing that at all
[2022-12-31 14:21:38] <%+canerengokdemir> another reason why I dont understand the hate is ronaldo is probably one of the biggest role models in sports history and a model human being in terms of the donations he has done
[2022-12-31 14:21:47] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Didn't you just mention the way he was playing for Madrid, thats not about the numbers LUL
[2022-12-31 14:21:48] <%+michael2ooo> Without ronaldo we would have finished bottom half of the table last season
[2022-12-31 14:21:50] <+tonyyysnow> @Lowkeysic its a fact, not media
[2022-12-31 14:21:51] <%+jaythemillerman> hi mate hope you are OK
[2022-12-31 14:21:51] <@%AaronBrookes94> I always have to ask though, why was Manchester United that bad that season? They only added CR7, Varane and Sancho right? Can't go from 2nd to 8th just adding those players, Sancho hardly played full 90's either right?
[2022-12-31 14:21:53] <ovinski> Ronaldo has set such a standard that the decline is more obvious
[2022-12-31 14:21:55] <+georgescfc2021> Balon dor aswell at united
[2022-12-31 14:22:03] <blazer33x> the perception looks bad ronny going to al nassar and messi winning the world cup
[2022-12-31 14:22:05] <BusFares> In a farmers league
[2022-12-31 14:22:08] <ovinski> But it doesn‚Äôt matter, the goat is forever the goat
[2022-12-31 14:22:11] <notsushirl> Ronaldos getting too much hate yes, but the way he left Man U was what sparked all this hate, the poor world cup performance, Messi winning the WC is whats sparked the over hate on Ronny
[2022-12-31 14:22:17] <dannylawton13> Farmers league
[2022-12-31 14:22:20] <zedenzidane> and ronaldo played in the prem as well
[2022-12-31 14:22:27] <+tonyyysnow> Ronaldo went downhill after Real Madrid
[2022-12-31 14:22:34] <%silvox_01> different league though i would say haaland is a better example
[2022-12-31 14:22:36] <%+peterlcfc> Haaland and Mbappe will easily fight for the records now
[2022-12-31 14:22:37] <Umar345> ronaldo won a ballondor at a very early age tho mbappe hasnt
[2022-12-31 14:22:40] <ovinski> He slowed down but it comes with age
[2022-12-31 14:22:44] <ovinski> Don‚Äôt get the argument lads
[2022-12-31 14:22:46] <69tw> Talisca

[2022-12-31 14:22:52] <adriantheimert> People have called Ronaldo finished since he turned 30, he just proved Them all wrong until last season

[2022-12-31 14:23:18] <jack_russell67> he forced a move from man u cuz he was that arrogant to think top clubs still wanted him
[2022-12-31 14:23:22] <Jas_supahiro> I think many people accepted he is in a decline. but he himself didn't accept it.
[2022-12-31 14:23:31] <Fuzzyjambo31> there is no such thing as an overal goat in a sport its all down to your own opinion to me the greatest all time for me is r9 and he was stuck with injuries in his career
[2022-12-31 14:23:35] <%+peterlcfc> he may even attract more players at Al Nassr

[2022-12-31 14:55:51] <FredrikNM> I got sweat in every game
[2022-12-31 14:55:55] <sam_valjean> I'm 7-1 at the moment and usually I get 11 wins

[2022-12-31 14:56:13] <%eltorrooow> @lpd1996 its such a minimal upgrade not worth the coins imo
[2022-12-31 14:56:14] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> I'm normally at 11/12 win player, somehow 9-0 rn, I know I'm not good enough to go much higher so think I'm just gonna give wins away if I reach 11

[2022-12-31 14:57:46] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> @vuittonn Most time efficient, get the 11 wins objective, get quali points for next weeks WL

[2022-12-31 15:27:22] <+itzjc24> @bazoteflondon you can tell he‚Äôs good though, the way he moves and the skills etc is way better than the 8-12 win player ‚Ä¶.

[2022-12-31 15:34:07] <FredrikNM> When I see Azuio play, its easy to see how good he is, because you see it from his perspective, and he skills good. But it is almost impossible to see how good an opponent is that a streamer is playing, because how the opponent is opening up your defense and pass quick you dont see unless you feel it yourself

[2022-12-31 15:37:05] <alialtan461> Competitive level can mean anything tho. A division 10 player who enters a $10 tournament is considered a competitive player the second he enters a tourney.
[2022-12-31 15:37:16] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I do think "competitive" is quite a wide gammut tbf. I think thats where people have an instinctive reaction to say "hes not". Cause they would assume that means pro rather than on the FUTBIN scoreboards at some point kind of thing
[2022-12-31 15:37:18] <+Baine95> getting 16 wins means ur good at fifa im fucking well in for competitive status here then cheers @NepentheZ

[2022-12-31 15:48:35] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> On discipline at Man United: "At a top club like this it has to be like that. There has to be discipline. The manager takes all of that into consideration. People have got away with silly things before. Like you've seen today, if you don't do the little things right then you won't play." - That is so so telling from Luke Shaw

[2022-12-31 15:50:09] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Ten Haag benched him for being late to a team meeting. Genius from ETH tbh

[2022-12-31 15:50:22] <donsterboy889> he came on at half time and scored the winner
[2022-12-31 15:50:26] <zebbedrifter> he didnt start today because he was late to something meeting or training im guessing

[2022-12-31 15:50:41] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @chriscfcwooooo But he didnt htough

[2022-12-31 15:51:04] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @lpd1996 Its the only way to keep the dressing room at a big club. Arteta is showing exactly the same at arsenal
[2022-12-31 15:51:06] <Nikobellic98> Everton with 5-4-1,just like me in fifa when I see Bappe and Al Owa
[2022-12-31 15:51:09] <Zyklov> If I play fifa than will I get to know more players and be able to know more about matches?
[2022-12-31 15:51:12] <%+Kieran96cfc> you cant be on hundreds of thousands a week and then be late to a team meeting at get away with it, Eth did the right thing imo

[2022-12-31 15:53:40] <%+chriscfcwooooo> maybe I'm in the minority but I think stuff like that won't keep the dressing room for long.

[2022-12-31 15:53:58] <%Dezalleycat> Ten Haag has been a revelation for the enemy,still a few years off,also Casemiro is some significant signing for em
[2022-12-31 15:53:59] <IbbyKanj_> I was just watching you and the sidemen playing Fifa 15
[2022-12-31 15:54:00] <%JWISEY249799> it may hurt them in the short run, but that discipline will come so good in the long run, will teach the youngsters coming through as well
[2022-12-31 15:54:03] <@%Viperlization> yes yes
[2022-12-31 15:54:03] <IbbyKanj_> Tournament
[2022-12-31 15:54:03] <%lpd1996> he will play mindgames or be harsh on them hoping they show out rather than let their ego tell them they cant be told anything
[2022-12-31 15:54:17] <vvvjonesyvvv> @chriscfcwooooo turning up for a meeting shouldn't even be considered discipline, it's common courtesy
[2022-12-31 15:54:19] <%+canerengokdemir> what is the rashford situation
[2022-12-31 15:54:22] <%+ace2ey> @chriscfcwooooo not if you're trying to build a team culture
[2022-12-31 15:54:30] <%timsunessson> Weekend league is the mbappe league everyone has them
[2022-12-31 15:54:31] <dannydee123001> will u be playing champs today
[2022-12-31 15:54:31] <%$Eoinft> For a whirl that worked for Henderson but that all he does for us now he just shouts and points at players, it‚Äôs not good enough for Liverpool
[2022-12-31 15:54:32] <%+brendanmcd8> viper is late - bench him for first half
[2022-12-31 15:54:33] <%timsunessson> him
[2022-12-31 15:54:34] <IbbyKanj_> I was just watching you and the sidemen playing Fifa 15!
[2022-12-31 15:54:35] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> The rules are set out on paper at the start of the season, as soon as Rashford knew he was gonna be late, he knew he'd be disciplined, its not like he'd have ben shocked or angry
[2022-12-31 15:54:36] <%+mykill91> im surprised how good casemiro has been considering they really wanted de jong
[2022-12-31 15:54:43] <Zecka201> is this game mode limited games?

[2022-12-31 15:55:14] <vvvjonesyvvv> @zecka201 would EA release a mode that isnt limited in this day and age??
[2022-12-31 15:55:15] <%+dtf1325> every single opponent I come against is alwqys 1 depth drop back. sweaty mofos
[2022-12-31 15:55:18] <+msannioba1> u only need 10 win out 28 and people still play like their lives are on the line
[2022-12-31 15:55:19] <%lpd1996> i wonder if TH let that slide rashford wouldn't have been as eager to try as hard
[2022-12-31 15:55:25] <%+shaqhinds03> @timsunessson not everyone has mbappe just be quiet
[2022-12-31 15:55:27] <%+ace2ey> wish that game mode was shorter halves or golden goal though.
[2022-12-31 15:55:35] <BlueBaron777> Yes, EA copied PES, PES tried to counter FUT by letting people get great teams easy.  SO EA to counter them and coin sellers made it easier for the average job to get decent teams.

[2022-12-31 15:55:49] <%Dezalleycat> @mykill91 I was saying to my mate who‚Äôs a Newcastle fan,that if they had an enforcer in midfield they will guarantee top 4,I still think they will but it‚Äôll go down to the last couple weeks
[2022-12-31 15:55:52] <+Aaron_McD9> Friendlies and draft are the worst game modes gameplay ways for me
[2022-12-31 15:55:58] <+tomswindell> Ronaldo goes and doos an interview with piers Morgan, Rashford goes and scores a winner - the mentality has changed at united. ETH won't change, the players will have to - and they will soon have realised it works, now in the top 4 and playing really well

[2022-12-31 16:40:57] <@%AaronBrookes94> @UTDBradleyy Hit the ground running there plus the WC win has inflated his price a hell of a lot. Only other time I've seen that sort of thing happen is in the BPL with homegrown English players

[2022-12-31 16:42:23] <@%AaronBrookes94> Enzo has the ability to be one of the best midfielders we've seen, he's still very young as well remember, he stays injury free, we can see the potential for one of the best midfielders of this generation
[2022-12-31 16:42:23] <stu92bal> teams pay for "potential" when it comes to youngsters

[2022-12-31 16:42:30] <%+riff_hunter44> Because he isnt worth it Simple and not to mention it inflates the market and makes it so much harder for everyone else to buy talented players at reasonable prices

[2022-12-31 16:44:04] <georgiapeplow27> if grealish is 100m enzo is a bargain at 120m

[2022-12-31 16:44:09] <+josh__m19> you can compare him to other overpaid players to make it seem better ig, but ¬£120M is a bit mad based on anything seen of him

[2022-12-31 16:44:57] <tommysellswhite> enzo worth 80 million euros, not 120. I'm portuguese, I watched that kid playing before the world cup. he's phenomenal but not worth it 120 or 130 million euros
[2022-12-31 16:45:02] <thatcosmic> @deivipao1313 they still might not win the league. chelsea will get top 4 i think, and theyre already in the ucl
[2022-12-31 16:45:11] <deivipao1313> @n7twogunsup but chelsea didnt even bid for Mudryk yet
[2022-12-31 16:45:22] <tommysellswhite> mudryk wants to go to arsenal

[2022-12-31 16:46:05] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> 120 million euros is too expensive for Enzo. But so is almost every transfer over like 75 million euros. I actually couldnt name you many above that that have been successes
[2022-12-31 16:46:18] <$beaglecg> People need to realise how inflated the market is for players these days. 120 mill is nothing.

[2022-12-31 16:46:27] <%+riff_hunter44> Its ridiculous prices on players like Enzo that are over inflating the market for everyone else and forcing the premier league to a point where only money buys the league again I just dont like it Nep sorry, my opinion
[2022-12-31 16:46:36] <$beaglecg> Especially for a player who just bossed it on the biggest stage
[2022-12-31 16:46:41] <deivipao1313> @thatcosmic and chelsea will definitely offer more wages to Mudryk and more money to Shaktar
[2022-12-31 16:46:42] <+Gworv> virgil was 75m
[2022-12-31 16:46:43] <willshire232323> If Maguire goes for ¬£80 mil 3 years ago then Enzo is defo worth 120

[2022-12-31 16:50:04] <willshire232323> @deivipao1313 Yeah I know he was good. But look how much Madrid paid for him all off the back of a WC
[2022-12-31 16:50:05] <%+happyspoon897> Tansfer fees aren't just about how much a player should "cost" right now. There's so much to consider - how much do Benfica need the money? Probably not much. The only pressure that Benfica potentially could have on them to make the transfer to happen would be from Enzo and his agent.   Then you've got to look at Enzo's potential, his rise has been mental and it doesn't look like he's going to stop anytime soon. He was incredible for Argentina in the World Cup.
[2022-12-31 16:50:15] <%+riff_hunter44> And now hes worth 120 Mil is that seriously your justification for a 120 MILLION price tag
[2022-12-31 16:50:24] <%Sammystaa> haaland is fired up in this game
[2022-12-31 16:50:26] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think hes a 70-80 mil player. 120 is too much

[2022-12-31 16:50:49] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> But so is almost every transfer fee atm
[2022-12-31 16:50:51] <%ElTenTwelve_> 120 is a lot but benfica are in such a good position due to other sales they can charge a premium
[2022-12-31 16:50:53] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Anyone who says Enzo isn't good enough or Chelsea are buying on WC form clearly doesn't play sorare, he's unbelievable

[2022-12-31 16:53:12] <cycling_greko> @tommysellswhite still waiting from you to explain how Liga Nos is competitive, that‚Äôs why they rip off premier league clubs because you overrate them so much
[2022-12-31 16:53:17] <$gavmesh> Clubs don't tend to make much if anything from shirt sales as deals from the shirt maker are usually paid up front
[2022-12-31 16:53:21] <FUTMONK_> @NepentheZ just like james rodriguez to REAL MADRID
[2022-12-31 16:53:23] <Flewis7> yea good point
[2022-12-31 16:53:24] <%+jokehereee> some people arent understanding the simple concept of everything has a price. something to you might be worse less that what its valued to someone else for example my car
[2022-12-31 16:53:27] <stupendouswren> Sure im a diehard united supporter and i know antony aint worth 100m but that‚Äôs the way football is now
[2022-12-31 16:53:28] <%lpd1996> so hyped for him to come to Chelsea, would have been gutted if he went to another prem team
[2022-12-31 16:53:29] <%eatburgers1> Arguing whether X player is worth Y amount is somewhat of a fools errand. If someone is willing to pay that amount then that is what the market deems he is worth
[2022-12-31 16:53:33] <ryan__donohue02> Buying any player after a good wc ur gonna have to pay an inflated price especially when a young up and coming player
[2022-12-31 16:53:35] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I would also argue that people wouldnt show any shock if Bellingham cost 120 mil euros...
[2022-12-31 16:53:36] <rjones86> syncCool syncCool syncCool syncCool syncCool syncCool
[2022-12-31 16:53:37] <+jondontattiescone> football is so much more than fees too. Al Nassr went from 990k insta followers to 1.5mil in half an hour of signing Ronny last night. So much exposure already
[2022-12-31 16:53:42] <%joebellis67> whats up nep
[2022-12-31 16:53:42] <%Dezalleycat> @futmonk_ It‚Äôs just not though
[2022-12-31 16:53:43] <nachomartin14> Also competition for the transfer raises a players price
[2022-12-31 16:53:46] <%+brendanmcd8> its funny Jude is worth all this money and its ok, because English? - no one blinked at Tchouameni last summer for 100m  Jude, Tchou, Musiala and Enzo are THE future midfielders
[2022-12-31 16:53:47] <ddoubledanny1> Could he do it on a rainy night at stoke though hahaha
[2022-12-31 16:53:47] <jack_russell67> his hype will go and it will be a waste of money seen before
[2022-12-31 16:53:51] <%+SterlingWinter> yea if you can buy a 21-year-old who is a potential world-class player and lock him in on a long-term deal the cost is semi-justifiable...
[2022-12-31 16:53:53] <deivipao1313> @Emile_DK_ bellingham would be better. english, already world class, has proven himself in one of the best leagues in the world
[2022-12-31 16:53:55] VIEWERS: 2¬†022
[2022-12-31 16:54:01] <themtnx3> if Cunha is 50 mil, Enzo is 100% 120 mil
[2022-12-31 16:54:01] <+dandriscoll7> bellingham is way better thats a stupid comment tbh
[2022-12-31 16:54:03] <matt__jame2> That‚Äôs crazy story for Enzo, good on him for making it to the biggest stage
[2022-12-31 16:54:04] <%lpd1996> if he was older he could have easily won player of the tournament he was insane
[2022-12-31 16:54:05] <stu92bal> he is not worth 120m atm, that is what Benfica consider acceptable for them to lose him out their team.
[2022-12-31 16:54:05] <tommysellswhite> @cycling_greko in the last three years, liga nos got more champions then the french like in like 14 years. farmers means no competition, in liga nos you have 3 contenders every year
[2022-12-31 16:54:11] <cycling_greko> Tell us about Nunez Nep, Liga Nos is a joke
[2022-12-31 16:54:15] <beanfgvf> Play fifa
[2022-12-31 16:54:15] <lsw38> Would you pay that money for Enzo?
[2022-12-31 16:54:18] <impog0> i remember when 100 mill for bale was insane and now every decent player is 100 mill plus
[2022-12-31 16:54:21] <%Dezalleycat> Great contextual comment tbh
[2022-12-31 16:54:31] <%krk0707> if antony got sold for 100 mil the  Enzo is absolutely 120
[2022-12-31 16:54:31] BAN: beanfgvf
[2022-12-31 16:54:33] <fawazor> are you a Lakers fan?

[2022-12-31 16:54:39] <Emile_DK_> @deivipao1313  i know however we still need more squad depth so 2 players are really needed but they are in talks with caicedo of brighton so will be fine
[2022-12-31 16:54:43] <Nkssbl> is there a dark-mode for sorare?
[2022-12-31 16:54:44] <+UTDBradleyy> Top midfielders are very scarce nowadays that‚Äôs why the fees are so high
[2022-12-31 16:54:44] <%eatburgers1> Do you think this will improve the chances for Saudi league getting added on sorare? Would be interesting
[2022-12-31 16:54:45] <+timmyo2> chelsea r getting him thouüò™
[2022-12-31 16:54:47] <+21irst> @cycling_greko benfica finished top of their UCL group with Juve and PSG - show some respect
[2022-12-31 16:54:52] <%+happyspoon897> I argued with so many people that were saying Harry Maguire wasn't worth 85m  - yes as a player he's not, probably not close. However, if you look at how much man united needed a Cb and how limited the options were. that's why  Leicester were able to get so much for him.
[2022-12-31 16:54:52] <%+CfcDre02> Up the chels
[2022-12-31 16:54:58] <imkekw> @NepentheZ Lewa or Benz??
[2022-12-31 16:55:00] <+timmyo2> üòã
[2022-12-31 16:55:01] <JackCorbo> Still 21 aswell
[2022-12-31 16:55:06] <willshire232323> My only concern is Enzo has done it for half a season and 7 games at a WC. Let‚Äôs hope the transfer fee doesn‚Äôt affect him like we‚Äôve seen it do to so many players
[2022-12-31 16:55:09] <@sorarejosh> i really dont think he suits chelsea tho, can see him flopping somewhat
[2022-12-31 16:55:14] <@%Witchwalker70> @Nkssbl Sadly no, not yet
[2022-12-31 16:55:15] <%$EitchBee> so sick. Barely anyone knew who he was before he got subbed in against Mexico and scored a banger. Now a month later he's on every teams wishlist
[2022-12-31 16:55:15] <yoo_andrew> Another reason he‚Äôs worth a lot more is because it‚Äôs middle of the season benfica don‚Äôt want to lose a valuable player kid season when they have league and champions league competitions
[2022-12-31 16:55:16] <stu92bal> @imkekw Benz all day
[2022-12-31 16:55:17] <tja_100> He isn‚Äôt better than partey yet
[2022-12-31 16:55:20] <BequitoXL> i feel like enzo will be the maguire of thwewc
[2022-12-31 16:55:22] <@%AaronBrookes94> It's a case of you want him, you pay the premium (or clause if he has one)
[2022-12-31 16:55:22] <+Ibra_fan_boy> I absolutely love performance analysis in football and I watch a video breaking down enzo Fernandes as a player, and it was fascinating he is absolute quality
[2022-12-31 16:55:23] <connorthagoatt> He has everything in his game, he‚Äôs only young as well so he‚Äôll only get better
[2022-12-31 16:55:27] <imkekw> @imkekw overall carrer??
[2022-12-31 16:55:27] <tommysellswhite> @cycling_greko I'm a sporting fan but you're right, literally sporting missed the knockstage in the last game, we would have three clubs in the knockouts! Porto, Benfica and Sporting
[2022-12-31 16:55:28] <%$luke83c> It would be interesting to do a comparison of the world‚Äôs best young talent (Foden, Musiala, Mbappe etc) and their market value as a comparison
[2022-12-31 16:55:29] <RafaKDB> and enzo gives you at least 10 years of top football, how much money a team spends in MC over 10 years??????
[2022-12-31 16:55:36] <%+SterlingWinter> $120 million and Chelsea will probably lock him in for 6 years too so 20 mil a year isn't terrible
[2022-12-31 16:55:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I reckon you could leave it to the summer and get him for 80-100. But if you want him now, you need to pay the buy out
[2022-12-31 16:55:42] <+grantwilson> It‚Äôs like sky contract you may pay ¬£80 a month but if it‚Äôs a 18 months contract you‚Äôll need to pay the full thing to leave
[2022-12-31 16:55:44] <%+lazy84> passes the eye test no doubt
[2022-12-31 16:55:44] <%Sammystaa> the players price ain't what there worth it's the price tag that the club sets , it's what the player is worth to the club
[2022-12-31 16:55:45] <%eatburgers1> More money has been wasted on players who have done far less than what ENzo has done
[2022-12-31 16:55:45] <+itsrj1991> It's  really an investment in his future and hoping he continues his upward trajectory
[2022-12-31 16:55:50] <+mackam69> Its too much for me at minute his stock is so high they are paying a fortune for player thats been great for 6 months.
[2022-12-31 16:55:50] <matt__jame2> Crazy business for benfica, 120m for Enzo and 70 for Nunez
[2022-12-31 16:55:52] <@%Witchwalker70> Loved the fb sorare talks
[2022-12-31 16:55:57] VIEWERS: 2¬†022
[2022-12-31 16:55:58] <%eatburgers1> He has shown enough for sure
[2022-12-31 16:56:00] <+Ibra_fan_boy> I absolutely love performance analysis in football and I watch a video breaking down enzo Fernandes as a player, and it was fascinating he is absolute quality
[2022-12-31 16:56:04] <+dandriscoll7> bellingham is clear tho so he should go for more
[2022-12-31 16:56:05] <tommysellswhite> @matt__jame2 and 126 for joao felix
[2022-12-31 16:56:07] <%+bongyyyyy> You been big on Enzo for the last year at least
[2022-12-31 16:56:10] <%dragosSRJ> the problem is not with the one who asks for the price, but with the one who pays it, so if they are ok to pay a lot of money, it is their problem
[2022-12-31 16:56:13] <@%AaronBrookes94> @Witchwalker70 They took me back to the late night Division 2 streams on Mixer
[2022-12-31 16:56:13] <+timmyo2> yup and we r getting him so happy
[2022-12-31 16:56:16] <%+pierce_23> benfica made like 600m in profit on players since like 2015 or something its crazy
[2022-12-31 16:56:26] <+Gworv> dele ali was a fantastic 21 year old
[2022-12-31 16:56:27] <willshire232323> I really hope he does well where we he goes. He is a beast in my FUT team at CDM
[2022-12-31 16:56:27] <JackCorbo> Enzo and Kova in a pivot could be spicy
[2022-12-31 16:56:28] <@%Witchwalker70> !00% Aaron
[2022-12-31 16:56:31] <fawazor> could it be a fluke like Falcao?
[2022-12-31 16:56:32] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @dandriscoll7 Belligham will go for 150+ unless theres a buy out
[2022-12-31 16:56:35] <valohn22> fb Nep was prime Nep
[2022-12-31 16:56:40] <deivipao1313> @Emile_DK_ yeah but then you have to bench one of them, and both of them combined are 200+ million pounds and Liverpool dont like to spend much so they should go for one of them, because one will play, the other wil get benched so money badly spent for one of the players. and i think Hendo is a good enough back up
[2022-12-31 16:56:47] <%Sammystaa> the players price ain't what there worth it's the price tag that the club sets , it's what the player is worth to the club
[2022-12-31 16:56:47] <tommysellswhite> @Gworv enzo fernandez does not play fortnite
[2022-12-31 16:56:50] <+josh__m19> fair enough, went in thinking its a ridiculous amount, but a good arguement there that at every opportunity he has smashed it. Beyond that, the 5 years on current contract adds a lot more then people would think.
[2022-12-31 16:56:53] <Flewis7> Benfica imo is the most underatted scouts
[2022-12-31 16:56:55] <%eatburgers1> BTW Nep I am James or GE250 on sorare and facebook if you remember
[2022-12-31 16:56:55] <FUTMONK_> @NepentheZ tbh chelsea should see if he fits in their system other wise it will be waste of money like werner n lukaku
[2022-12-31 16:56:55] <%+Kieran96cfc> it helps that Benfica always get Champions league football
[2022-12-31 16:56:59] <%krk0707> the Portuguese bvb

[2022-12-31 16:57:27] <Emile_DK_> @deivipao1313  totally right did not think about that.  bellingham and caicedo was the best option if they can manage to do it
[2022-12-31 16:57:28] <%dragosSRJ> the problem is not with the one who asks for the price, but with the one who pays it, so if they are ok to pay a lot of money, it is their problem
[2022-12-31 16:57:31] <%$luke83c> Is so rare a reliable indicator of player ability? If so, does he have stand out so rare scores for his age and the leagues he has played in?
[2022-12-31 16:57:34] <flipau10> loan version lol
[2022-12-31 16:57:38] <tommysellswhite> @Gworv mate, trust me. enzo is ten times more a professional then dele alli was. he does not lack discipline like alli
[2022-12-31 16:57:41] <Flewis7> if you know the player you should know if they fit their system no?
[2022-12-31 16:57:42] <here4rewards_> Grealish

[2022-12-31 16:57:44] <%ntblue1034> @fawazor Falcao scored like 120 goals in 160 games for atleti and monaco... how's that a fluke?
[2022-12-31 16:57:51] <cycling_greko> @21irst and Nunez scored 34 goals with Benfica last year but in a competitive league like PL he is a joke, don‚Äôt overrate players from a farmers league
[2022-12-31 16:57:52] <+ispool4u> Anyone else having problems in first owner fiesta?  Went 7-1 with ease last week and I‚Äôm 1-5 currently
[2022-12-31 16:57:53] <deivipao1313> chelsea should focus on getting a striker, because aubameyang hasnt worked out
[2022-12-31 16:57:58] VIEWERS: 2¬†022
[2022-12-31 16:57:58] <here4rewards_> Grealish was worth 100m to Villa
[2022-12-31 16:57:59] <%$blublud84> it's what they are worth to the club/s
[2022-12-31 16:58:00] <@%AaronBrookes94> I can see Enzo going to Chelsea and Kante going back to France personally
[2022-12-31 16:58:03] <%+always_rainy98> the price is surely just what it takes to remove them from their current club, not necessarily their actual value
[2022-12-31 16:58:03] <scmk536> portugal league is a good place for brazilians to cross over to europe bc language
[2022-12-31 16:58:07] <deivipao1313> @Emile_DK_ as i said, Hendo is a good enough back up
[2022-12-31 16:58:17] <+Gworv> age 21 dele ali was 1 of the biggest prospects
[2022-12-31 16:58:18] <valohn22> @norris36 tbh clubs with skillz ksi and freezy was my best time alive

[2022-12-31 16:58:25] <wizkid_205> @nepenthez what do you think of the 3 American midfielders Musah, Adams, and mckinnie ?
[2022-12-31 16:58:31] <FUTMONK_> @NepentheZ all comes down to the manager he's boss on n off the pitch tbh
[2022-12-31 16:58:31] <+jondontattiescone> Al Nassr have went from 990k insta followers to 4.5mil now. That's insane. Imagine growing your exposure 4 fold in 18 hours
[2022-12-31 16:58:34] <Flewis7> yeah smart there Nep
[2022-12-31 16:58:36] <OrganicCrocodile> benfica needs enzo for the champions league thats why they put 120mill
[2022-12-31 16:58:43] <deivipao1313> @Emile_DK_ he also has that leadership so they need him on that bench
[2022-12-31 16:58:45] <%eatburgers1> Do you think Ronaldo's move might improve chances for Saudi league to get scored on sorare?
[2022-12-31 16:58:47] <tommysellswhite> @scmk536 you're 100% correct
[2022-12-31 16:58:53] <%Dezalleycat> Clubs are held to ransom by other clubs in terms of cost,through giving youngsters long term contracts,it‚Äôs all a scam,and it feels like a natural progression that wil get worse
[2022-12-31 16:58:56] <%+louisw26> Why United had to pay so much for antony as the season started and Ajax didn‚Äôt want to sell
[2022-12-31 16:58:59] <+harrisonovhull2> so how much do you think emi martinez is worth now
[2022-12-31 16:59:06] <%+maxsmith16_> is it official with enzo yet?
[2022-12-31 16:59:07] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Release clauses exist for a reason
[2022-12-31 16:59:07] <+UTDBradleyy> Maguire went for ‚Ç¨95m so Enzo for ‚Ç¨120m isn‚Äôt that bad
[2022-12-31 16:59:21] <Flewis7> how much did benfica buy him for?
[2022-12-31 16:59:23] <%JWISEY249799> literally the same with darwin and anthony, neither needed to sell them hence the slightly higher cost
[2022-12-31 16:59:23] <liamol03> what do you think of Darwin?
[2022-12-31 16:59:23] <lowkey_cole> You honestly could not explain this any better those who don‚Äôt understand are choosing to be an annoyance on purpose
[2022-12-31 16:59:31] <fawazor> like Falcao!
[2022-12-31 16:59:32] <london_is_blue92> Enzo and nkunku at the bridge next season I wish this season would end so we can get on to next season
[2022-12-31 16:59:39] <princey121091> Also people forget Benfica just sold Darwin for silly money, they don‚Äôt need to cash
[2022-12-31 16:59:41] <Emile_DK_> @deivipao1313  dont agree with that he is a back up yes but we need to think for a future as well. i agree we need him in the squad but as you can see the amount of games their are played we need more players. Liverpool cant compete with city for years and years without squad depth
[2022-12-31 16:59:45] <+UTDBradleyy> I‚Äôm sure Benfica will sell him for less in the summer it‚Äôs just they don‚Äôt wanna sell now
[2022-12-31 16:59:50] <%+deathskamikaze> people dont seem to understand that someone on a long term contract is going to cost more to buy out

[2022-12-31 17:00:17] <Flewis7> I think he would fit in Juventus
[2022-12-31 17:00:24] <%+DirtyDishFC> Of course cause in the EPL he will be challenged all the time. La Liga has a bigger skill gap if you will
[2022-12-31 17:00:25] <%Dezalleycat> I don‚Äôt see it as much of a challenge for him at Madrid,bit of a cop out
[2022-12-31 17:00:26] <HamderO_> camavinga, tchoa, bellingham and valverde is all better than enzo
[2022-12-31 17:00:27] <FUTMONK_> @NepentheZ real will go all in for bellingham he's 19 and can be resold to premier league for 150 million TBH
[2022-12-31 17:00:27] <scmk536> enzo tchou and cama, sheeeesh
[2022-12-31 17:00:29] <%+rpc84> 15 yellow cards and two reds in that Barcelona game wtf
[2022-12-31 17:00:30] <BlueE148> Too good for Chelsea
[2022-12-31 17:00:31] <deivipao1313> @Emile_DK_ i mean Harvey Elliot and Carvalho im pretty sure can play in that position
[2022-12-31 17:00:32] <jonasgamer02> juventus LUL

[2022-12-31 17:00:36] <RafaKDB> i hope we dont sell enzo, we need him for champions league
[2022-12-31 17:00:37] <+xxbluedragon1911xx> enzo and kova Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2022-12-31 17:00:42] <matt__jame2> He would deffo play for Madrid, they‚Äôre rebuilding their midfield already
[2022-12-31 17:00:43] <+teasyy_tom> good afternoon nep üëä‚úå
[2022-12-31 17:00:47] <@sorarejosh> trippier is a so5 cheat code
[2022-12-31 17:00:53] <Moe_OM> Yooooo I'm here
[2022-12-31 17:00:54] <djz19_> valverde, camavinga, tchouameni and jude looks close to joining, enzo doesn‚Äôt really have a place there
[2022-12-31 17:00:54] <fawazor> Enzo is good, can play striker!
[2022-12-31 17:00:54] <+PistolPett> I think Enzo at Man United with a Martinez partnership could be cool. He would replace the Frenkie De Jong rumour and would fit their system well
[2022-12-31 17:00:59] <Da_kapo> Enzo would get game time kroos might be retiring
[2022-12-31 17:01:01] <elzfletch03> Portugese and french league are very good for finding hidden gems.
[2022-12-31 17:01:07] <%ntblue1034> Real Madrid already have a young midfield of Tchouameni, Camavinga and Valverde when Kroos and Modric move on
[2022-12-31 17:01:16] <%Dezalleycat> Trippier is absolutely criminally underrated
[2022-12-31 17:01:17] <%krk0707> enzo would work with kova
[2022-12-31 17:01:19] <here4rewards_> I wish I took Tripps over Trent for my commons

[2022-12-31 17:01:29] <+mindful_dad> How is Chelsea able to pay that much for a player with their owners situation
[2022-12-31 17:01:32] <elzfletch03> Trippier is a bonus point machine in fpl
[2022-12-31 17:01:38] <ThomasSheppard11> whats aa
[2022-12-31 17:01:43] <@sorarejosh> i think building into a champ euro team is smart with the anticipated prem and them juiced prize pools
[2022-12-31 17:01:43] <+josh__m19> looks like a football manager scan lol
[2022-12-31 17:01:44] <%+wayne2tatos> I compare the Enzo situation to grealish at villa being a villa fan was he worth 100 mil no but he was to the us club captain and by far are best player and a lot of fans did not like he signed a new contract then left but he put that release cause in there to make sure villa got a insane amount if someone was to pay it
[2022-12-31 17:01:44] <%eatburgers1> What are your thoughts on the treshold rule changes? It makes it much harder to have just one team that you can plug in each week for threshold, prices out the smaller managers imo
[2022-12-31 17:01:46] <otto_lfc> Can you check Quincy Promes

Obviously with fantasy football you earn points then in the end you aim to get the most, is this the same concept but with real money so you at the end of the season you win loads of money or will you carry it on into next season?

[2022-12-31 17:11:50] <%+FlushFactory52> Hi Nep.  Some Sorare advice please.  I'm a bit stuck as loved playing common for 6 months and have learnt loads along side watching your streams.  Definitely ready to move on a level but really not sure I can afford it  Feels like it would be quite expensive to buy some semi decent limited cards when i've investigated?

[2022-12-31 17:12:20] <%eatburgers1> sorare would have so much more upside if the prices were tied to a stablecoin or fiat rather than ETH
[2022-12-31 17:12:22] <%bazza3166> thats how you learn though
[2022-12-31 17:12:31] <@%AaronBrookes94> But didn't Lewa win you some decent rewards? Nothing groundbreaking but some good ETH finishes right?

[2022-12-31 17:19:38] <Post_FUT_Clarity> @FlushFactory52 yeah, I gave it a lot of thought and after blaming everyone else, I came to conclusion I'm the only one to blame for being broke LUL like they're in it to make profit, common league, cheap reward limiteds etc, it's there to bait you into spending more, but as F2P player it's a slim slim chance to get to glory. And I'm ok with that
[2022-12-31 17:19:43] <%m3elv1n> does first owner cards do anyhing
[2022-12-31 17:19:46] <%eatburgers1> It's not similar at all and the business model is completely different. You can see how much real money is being generated by people buying new players from sorare, you can actually see where the money is coming from, which was never there on FI

[2022-12-31 17:28:33] <+dgavin91> tbf on the nba one I got 67th first week and have got 8 orange cards without spending

[2022-12-31 17:28:56] <+jacktwoodard00> Do u get free players when u sign up ?
[2022-12-31 17:29:00] <+dgavin91> yeah
[2022-12-31 17:29:03] <%Dezalleycat> Does that mean you can only enter if you‚Äôve done poorly?
[2022-12-31 17:29:07] <+dgavin91> you do daily
[2022-12-31 17:29:10] <Post_FUT_Clarity> would you advise entering with 2 limiteds, because you can enter with 1 ?
[2022-12-31 17:29:18] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I would always say that 15 quid will give you two fun enough limiteds to participate in these comps. Once your comfortable, it will just accelerate you a little bit
[2022-12-31 17:29:19] <+dgavin91> enter 3 squads every gameweek
[2022-12-31 17:29:29] <DerDansen> @Post_FUT_Clarity go with 2 bc of 20% increase of points for limited

[2022-12-31 17:36:33] <+Siiimply> so what are the negative of this? or is it perfect? you speak so highly of it and there seems to be no negatives. is that right?
[2022-12-31 17:36:38] <%whufcconnor> whats the average points for top 100?
[2022-12-31 17:37:19] <xdhefty> how come I dont have that kick off unlocked?

[2022-12-31 17:41:07] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @Siiimply Its not gambling imo. There is skill involved and its fantasy football which isnt gambling as far as Im aware. But the second part is true yeah

[2022-12-31 17:43:15] <+Siiimply> @Post_FUT_Clarity if they player does lose value then you have lost your investment, thats a loss no?

[2022-12-31 17:43:20] <%+fistyanan> and the state of the crypto economy, you could win everything and anything in sorare and still be in the negatives because crypto crash, am i wrong?

[2022-12-31 17:43:50] <Post_FUT_Clarity> @Siiimply by that logic stock investing, buying property etc, classifies as gambling?

[2022-12-31 17:46:03] <Post_FUT_Clarity> @Siiimply yes it's a risk, but everything around us is a risk, you can buy a home to live in, and it loses value in couple of years so you say I gambled? everything in life is gambling then

[2022-12-31 17:48:37] <%eatburgers1> ONe tip I can give for new managers if they are depositing a bit is to research that first gameweek you're playing meticulously. You don't get the chance to simply buy players for perfect matchups when you have a more set gallery. It's what I did in my first week and came 3rd to win a Super Rare (in the afcon)

[2022-12-31 18:01:54] <%+609blazers> what if arsenal won a prem/europa league double? maybe even treble if we win fa cup

[2022-12-31 18:03:40] <vinigem> The best thing about current Arsenal team is that our goals are coming from different players and not dependent a single player.

[2022-12-31 18:05:36] <Merk708> Arteta is using Citys tactics from last year. Info from Jesus and Zinchenko
[2022-12-31 18:05:40] <Post_FUT_Clarity> new hair Holding is prime Maldini
[2022-12-31 18:05:40] <%+CfcDre02> Lakonga still like 22 too
[2022-12-31 18:05:45] <%+SCF08onFIFA> Suarez signed for Gremio
[2022-12-31 18:05:45] <+BYCakes> if you need a goal late on, there isn't many options on that bench in my opinion
[2022-12-31 18:05:47] <+Zuboronovic> Holding is very composed
[2022-12-31 18:05:47] <Post_FUT_Clarity> or Holdini
[2022-12-31 18:05:49] <+OllieC67> How many packs would give you a good chance at toty? 3/400?
[2022-12-31 18:05:49] <%ntblue1034> Lokonga is still very young and developing.  People wanted him to come in and be Vieira 2.0

[2022-12-31 18:06:00] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> id go as far as saying holding is your back backup tomiyasue would come in for gabriel or saliba with white moving to centre back
[2022-12-31 18:06:04] <johnnynelson11> He doesn‚Äôt get near arsenal 11 now

[2022-12-31 18:08:58] <%+jsh66> No Caicedo or Macallister is a big miss
[2022-12-31 18:08:59] <emilesmithshow> Nep I‚Äôm so fking nervous man this can be 7 points
[2022-12-31 18:08:59] <+itsHeatz_> lamptey is good
[2022-12-31 18:09:01] <inhousechef> brighton are very in form but i don‚Äôt think strong enough to beat arsenal, could surprise everyone though
[2022-12-31 18:09:01] <%+CfcDre02> Lewisssss
[2022-12-31 18:09:03] <+hugoboss0000> pf23Love pf23Love pf23Love
[2022-12-31 18:09:03] <here4rewards_> Brighton missing Mac Alisstar and Caicedo is huge
[2022-12-31 18:09:04] <+willsilva98> Im still worried about United though if we dont get a striker. the fixtures will ruin our squad with our limited players compared to the teams around us with a deeper squad. Can't wait for the glazers to sell
[2022-12-31 18:09:05] <JackCorbo> Colwill future Chelsea legend
[2022-12-31 18:09:09] <Post_FUT_Clarity> they annihilated Chelsea before WC
[2022-12-31 18:09:09] <+Jasonrr21> Is it just me whos gameplay is awful ??
[2022-12-31 18:09:11] <Battyyman> totw sane or gold mane
[2022-12-31 18:09:11] <%+pierce_23> @Viperlization i still also fear our depth at CB - Lindeloff and Maguire just arent good enough and Varane is unreal but so injury prone
[2022-12-31 18:09:11] <PREITAM22> welbeck
[2022-12-31 18:09:13] <kieran___cheale> Webster is a solid centre back
[2022-12-31 18:09:19] <$lewisridgway5> Brighton are so underrated
[2022-12-31 18:09:22] <%ntblue1034> adam webster as well
[2022-12-31 18:09:27] <%+stackmillz> top 4 will b arsenal, city, man u, and liverpool
[2022-12-31 18:09:30] <%+philllaws1981> @willsilva98 this x 100!
[2022-12-31 18:09:32] <inhousechef> he scores most of his goals from pens though lol
[2022-12-31 18:09:36] <@%Viperlization> @pierce_23 Shaw has been great in the fill in role there. Very nice having him play there tbh
[2022-12-31 18:09:37] <+christoussaint> hey Nep started FIFA 3 days ago and have made 350k from bronze packs .... and they say it doesn't work
[2022-12-31 18:09:40] <%+pierce_23> reality the whole squad is a bit lacking
[2022-12-31 18:09:41] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> If you drop points against Newcastle and Spurs and then United beat you. United could be level on points. That is terrifying.
[2022-12-31 18:09:46] <%$liamfifa91> As a Newcastle fan that was a hard watch! Definitely need another striker
[2022-12-31 18:09:50] <+itsHeatz_> what is that photo hahahaha
[2022-12-31 18:09:54] <@%Viperlization> Don't manifest Josh
[2022-12-31 18:09:54] <JackCorbo> When do the yellow cards reset?
[2022-12-31 18:10:02] <@%Viperlization> City aren't even invincble this season
[2022-12-31 18:10:03] <+telma_mukambi> mitomo is crazy good
[2022-12-31 18:10:04] <%+pierce_23> @Viperlization i agree with this! i was always curious him or wan bissaka filling in there so i like the set up last 2 games
[2022-12-31 18:10:10] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Brighton will lose Trossard ciacedo and Macallister so they are gonna need to invest hard
[2022-12-31 18:10:13] <martingheee> Odds of newcastle winning the league?
[2022-12-31 18:10:26] <+DavyeBee24> Is it not a suspension after every 4 yellows
[2022-12-31 18:10:28] <%+philllaws1981> I think at this point lots of people have to say they underrated ETH
[2022-12-31 18:10:28] <+Jutmanc> Had one in the EFL Cup too
[2022-12-31 18:10:28] <%+enragedsamurai> we are indeed nep we will catch you

[2022-12-31 18:10:35] <@%Viperlization> @pierce_23 I've always wanted to see AWB in there (think he only works in a 3) like Walker did for England last tournament.
[2022-12-31 18:10:36] <TIZZIT> United not stable enough as a club to take them serious
[2022-12-31 18:10:45] <%+CfcDre02> Please Arsenal, help us out
[2022-12-31 18:10:45] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> 12 points separating top 6
[2022-12-31 18:10:50] <@%Viperlization> wait
[2022-12-31 18:10:50] <%+stackmillz> newcastle will not b top 4 with chris wood as the striker
[2022-12-31 18:10:53] <+thund3rbolt_114> united will fall off they just dont have the squad and the owners wont spend i wouldnt worry about em
[2022-12-31 18:10:54] <justn_wrg> dont think it resets in the league
[2022-12-31 18:10:55] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Whats wild about united is that we conceded 10 goals in 2 games.
[2022-12-31 18:10:56] <@%Viperlization> youi've got a game in hand over city too FKN HELL
[2022-12-31 18:10:56] <here4rewards_> if the takeover of United was timed better we could genuinely compete with a big January, Understandable that Glazers only want loans while selling
[2022-12-31 18:10:59] <inhousechef> would love to see a special martinelli card he deserves it
[2022-12-31 18:11:01] <+smokeymcpot_99> That‚Äôs a crazy comment
[2022-12-31 18:11:03] <+blazeshadowdark> Playing Man City home and away will be the decision I reckon
[2022-12-31 18:11:04] <%+rpc84> Way too early to call anything
[2022-12-31 18:11:05] <gjr433> man salah just sold for 4k sfn
[2022-12-31 18:11:08] <%+pierce_23> @Viperlization YES! I love him and feel for him. Really dont want to lose him but he doesnt offer anything going forward so we should at least try that
[2022-12-31 18:11:08] <andrew_maggipint0> still have 2 against city
[2022-12-31 18:11:08] <+benafc69> Who are are spurs?
[2022-12-31 18:11:10] <+smokeymcpot_99> Could lose to city twice and it‚Äôs back down to 1 point
[2022-12-31 18:11:14] <@%Viperlization> Whos the game in hand over City?
[2022-12-31 18:11:19] <naappo> Spurs is a joke of a club. Not tough game
[2022-12-31 18:11:19] <%+609blazers> kick about in the park with the boys vs brentford
[2022-12-31 18:11:28] <deano1123> today
[2022-12-31 18:11:29] <+jrossino> World Cup has been kind to arsenal imo
[2022-12-31 18:11:34] <@%Viperlization> Oh you're right
[2022-12-31 18:11:34] <Da_kapo> Brighton

[2022-12-31 18:11:41] <%+enragedsamurai> you havent got a game in hand its the game today
[2022-12-31 18:11:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> And there would still be 14 games left. Even after the next 9. We arent even halfway through the season yet
[2022-12-31 18:11:44] <@%Viperlization> Bean moment
[2022-12-31 18:11:49] <%ntblue1034> Even with a win today, 7 points with 22 games to go is nothing
[2022-12-31 18:11:52] <@%Viperlization> Holy
[2022-12-31 18:11:53] <%+philllaws1981> Arsene is smiling at Arteta üòÄ

[2022-12-31 18:12:01] <inhousechef> the relegation battle this year will be so interesting to watch
[2022-12-31 18:12:09] <gjr433> are u able to get a rare  and out of daily lol
[2022-12-31 18:12:15] <TIZZIT> Arsenal will win the league with ease

[2022-12-31 18:12:28] <hamza_a97> hahahahah
[2022-12-31 18:12:29] <%chrisdepot> If we make it to February as top I think we can start getting excited
[2022-12-31 18:12:29] <%+pierce_23> if Haaland picks up an injury it opens it up for Arsenal i think
[2022-12-31 18:12:30] <JammieDodge191> I‚Äôll take that
[2022-12-31 18:12:30] <%$Knaussenheimer> well thats a relief

[2022-12-31 18:12:31] <inhousechef> i don‚Äôt think arsenal were ever expecting to be relegated lol
[2022-12-31 18:12:35] <Da_kapo> 7 points clear if they win but city are more than capable of put 10/15 wins in a row together madness really

[2022-12-31 18:12:44] <%melvin25_> if arsenal do win today 7 ahead of city bet you were never expecting that
[2022-12-31 18:12:44] <jo3r100> Apparently Liverpool r trying to get caicedo from Brighton     Thoughts?
[2022-12-31 18:12:49] <@%Viperlization> Nah. Arteta has you playing class
[2022-12-31 18:12:50] <%+enragedsamurai> sorry feels weird to say that we arent half way through the season at this time of year
[2022-12-31 18:12:51] <%+philllaws1981> remember that season Bryan Robson kept West Brom up!!
[2022-12-31 18:13:02] <ianwrightfan> Would you like EA to change the chem system again?
[2022-12-31 18:13:07] <%+pierce_23> like Alvarez is class but hes not Haalands level so if city somehow lose him and or de bruyne itll be interesting
[2022-12-31 18:13:07] <@%Viperlization> Lets see what you do in Jan
[2022-12-31 18:13:11] <%eletele93> Arsenal still might be the first club in history of Prem which got relegated with 40 points
[2022-12-31 18:13:11] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I also think you have to face some adversity at some point
[2022-12-31 18:13:13] <@sorarejosh> something random like a ramsdale season ending injury will happen , just the arsenal way
[2022-12-31 18:13:13] <@%Viperlization> Depth or starters?
[2022-12-31 18:13:13] <inhousechef> but i‚Äôm sure arteta will make some january signings
[2022-12-31 18:13:15] <+J4CK23_> for some reason i just cant imagine arsenal winning the league idk
[2022-12-31 18:13:16] <%czechmate92576> has anyone been in first this late and not stayed up? genuinely asking,that would've been crazy
[2022-12-31 18:13:17] <%+rpc84> Someone explain how people are calling a league winner already lol

[2022-12-31 18:13:28] <%+stackmillz> lets talk about fulham in 7th lol
[2022-12-31 18:13:30] <%+rparr94> I‚Äôd rather just lose to Oxford and not go far in Europe league to have a chance of the title
[2022-12-31 18:13:31] <+benafc69> Nketiah vs Dunk, I will love it and I think I de zerbit
[2022-12-31 18:13:33] <@%Viperlization> How happy are you with your full fit 11?
[2022-12-31 18:13:35] <+rydinho08> up the arsenal!!!

[2022-12-31 18:13:41] <%+enragedsamurai> United need a striker in Jan, id look at vlahovic
[2022-12-31 18:13:42] <ianwrightfan> Would you like EA to change the chem system again?
[2022-12-31 18:13:43] <%ntblue1034> Honestly think of how perfect a bench/depth option up top Giroud would be in this squad
[2022-12-31 18:13:56] <%+mikekozy23> the nba sorare seems potentially pretty profitable no?
[2022-12-31 18:14:02] <TIZZIT> I prefer Nketiah to Jesus
[2022-12-31 18:14:02] <@%Viperlization> That;s awesome depth to have at LB isn't it
[2022-12-31 18:14:03] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> So I was listening to talk sport this morning only Toney has scored 12 in 14 this season or something like that will he move next year and would u like him at arsenal??
[2022-12-31 18:14:07] <@%Viperlization> You want that everywhere
[2022-12-31 18:14:14] <%+philllaws1981> Any time a silver plays instead of a gold there's a risk üòâ
[2022-12-31 18:14:17] <@%Viperlization> Isn't your only loss to us this season too?

[2022-12-31 18:14:29] <simonasken> Actually enjoy seeing another team other than city and Liverpool challenge for the title
[2022-12-31 18:14:30] <%+mikekozy23> @Viperlization what team do you play for?
[2022-12-31 18:14:31] <south_coast_angler> CHOOONNNNNN
[2022-12-31 18:14:34] <+benafc69> Nketiah is better than jesus vs brighton,  few chances so need to take them
[2022-12-31 18:14:36] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Want to hear a wild stat. United have not conceded a goal with Martinez, Varane and Casemiro on the pitch

[2022-12-31 18:15:05] <@%Viperlization> I genuinely think Casemiro is the best DM in the world
[2022-12-31 18:15:07] <+mozzaonstix> arsenal need another utility player and someone with experience and proven quality in january otherwise they will almost definietly have to deal with some squad problems unfortunately
[2022-12-31 18:15:08] <@%Viperlization> Comfortably
