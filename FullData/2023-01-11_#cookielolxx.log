[2023-01-11 12:36:28] <+Myowol> didnt he say ad varus is bad a couple of days ago?
[2023-01-11 12:36:30] <+austinjakobh> @3brick_ It Draven relies on continuously getting his cash out. Maybe try to play a champ that is easier to get ahead on. He‚Äôs balanced around snowballing with his passive so if he can‚Äôt keep cashing out he falls behind.
[2023-01-11 12:36:30] <$spiritual_cockroach> @joudatw almost like he didn't mean it snipyoOhNo

[2023-01-11 12:54:00] <%dedbwj123> I think he means having a mindset that yopur teammates are NPCs, its not that hes calling them NPCs because he thinks they are NPCs as people, but rather having the mindset of treating ur teammates in game as NPCs to focus on yourself.

[2023-01-11 14:56:06] <TheRealForestElf> csing with Trist if it goes right is so nice
[2023-01-11 14:56:26] <ponynationn> @megudmyteamxd how tf u choose to ban mf instead of twitch/cait as aphelios
[2023-01-11 14:56:44] <eloucious730> @ponynationn old one looked like a noose
[2023-01-11 14:56:44] <levyathan1999> i prefer to ban zed tho
[2023-01-11 14:56:55] <%hyperion__gamer> @ponynationn ban draven as aphelios
[2023-01-11 14:56:58] <kiikii_stay> @ponynationn Probably A Personal Preferance
[2023-01-11 14:57:03] <%MeGudMyTeamXD> @ponynationn true its rough to play against cait most of the time but mf is the worst i feel like
[2023-01-11 14:57:04] <+StaticAndCo> I will permaban draven and no one can stop me
