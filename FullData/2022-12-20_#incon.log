[2022-12-20 20:26:34] <+BamaMophi> @danger_corpse King Arthur’s auto attacks don’t proc item effects. The only reason he can crit is because crit isn’t coded as an on hit auto effect

[2022-12-20 20:35:46] <+BamaMophi> @tubbythesatan At least with Atalanta’s you get supplementary stats and a passive. Rage’s passive is just more crit and in the current item pool, you don’t get 100% crit chance in any less items so getting rage for just more crit is pointless

[2022-12-20 20:36:30] <@%TubbyTheSatan> @BamaMophi rage is nice is db would be a slightly better item, so you can double buy crit instead of needing 3 slots. Then again hunters want atk speed so wind will always be better than it.

[2022-12-20 20:38:36] <+BamaMophi> Hunters want attack speed. Most games want antiheal so you’d be getting shadowsteel anyway. If you want double items crit, you just want shadowsteel and deathbringer for that nice 50%. Rage does bring it up considerably but you still have that chance to not crit which can be detrimental if you’re spending an entire slot just to try and guarantee a crit you miss anyway
[2022-12-20 20:38:45] <%+heterochromia98> @tubbythesatan Yeah but you just oneshot people with literally 1 auto or 2 at most. That happened to me so many times
[2022-12-20 20:39:11] <+BamaMophi> If they gave rage a real passive or 5% more crit chance on finishing, it might be useful
