[2022-12-07 06:08:22] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/

[2022-12-07 07:06:59] <$LuckyLuke063> 1. We were out of the city for about 3 weeks and 2. the children in question are members of our party, they joined us later in the quest. While being questioned about the children by that motherly figure of mine, our dwarf cleric just said "look at her arm" and ran away towards the tavern with the 2 children, leaving me alone to explain everything. the8bitFine
[2022-12-07 07:07:19] <+wizardwolf42> @ajeds hey hey KonCha
[2022-12-07 07:07:20] <$LuckyLuke063> Not only that but once in the tavern, our cleric started drinking and started a bar fight, which resulted in one of the children, a harengon (rabbitfolk) barbarian to go in a rage and almost kill someone. Once again, I'm left alone to explain everything to those people who saved me. I'm in big trouble the8bitFine

[2022-12-07 07:14:55] <%Notafix> then they canceled the order
[2022-12-07 07:15:21] <%mdkubit> A ghost restaurant is a 'fake' restaurant online you can order from, that is physically sharing space with a real restaurant.
[2022-12-07 07:15:29] <%Notafix> like, ihop has "Thrilled Cheese" but but you have to go into the ihop to pick it up

They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.
