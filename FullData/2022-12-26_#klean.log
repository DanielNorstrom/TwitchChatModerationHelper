[2022-12-26 00:00:08] <+pochiyeah> no idea how the game doesnt just completely break considering all the system they have that all gotta work together
[2022-12-26 00:00:08] <+captainpaddy_ttv> I havent enjoyed lighthouse just bc I have FPS drop for the first like 5 mins.

[2022-12-26 00:00:34] <1killersquirrel> one thing I love about tarkov is the   uniqueness of the maps, not some auto-generated map layouts that all look the same

[2022-12-26 00:01:21] <7r4pp3r> I would love to see more cool scav loadouts... maybe even insane build as late wipe events
[2022-12-26 00:01:21] <Unbe> Sick idea

[2022-12-26 00:01:51] <%TheWalkingDad263> so your saying homeless looking people are bad people? Kappa
[2022-12-26 00:01:53] <Thee_Smooth> Gopnik or bust
[2022-12-26 00:02:06] <oni_pepega> would definitely be cool to be able to tell apart low and high karma scavs
[2022-12-26 00:02:06] <+Ki11aB44> yes
[2022-12-26 00:02:13] <1killersquirrel> nikita said he likes the uncertainity of who is who and what are their intentions, so he might be against identifying karma based on anything visual

[2022-12-26 00:02:39] <%holyfrenzyoffline> that would make me care about scavs more and u might get rewards if u leave with a dope out scav
[2022-12-26 00:02:50] <+captainpaddy_ttv> Are they revamping like quests? I dont like the quests and how they all have stayed the same each wipe. I get the new ones but imo need to change it up and do total overhaul.
[2022-12-26 00:02:55] <1killersquirrel> cool idea, don't get me wrong, but I don't decide LUL
[2022-12-26 00:03:02] <Optima1> i just played og Dayz mod a couple of days ago, it's amazing lol

[2022-12-26 00:03:33] <+califamadness> yep,i watched yt at that time
[2022-12-26 00:03:36] <%holyfrenzyoffline> shot it
[2022-12-26 00:03:47] <+nevcogold> I think they should add small stats to some wearable items. Like the mustache, have it give like 1 level more of aim stability or something. Nothing huge like a MMO, but small crap would be cool
[2022-12-26 00:04:02] <%Toto0596> @klean so in your opinion how does the scav run fit into BSG’s idea for the game? If you’re supposed to transition from map to map how does the scav fit in?

[2022-12-26 00:12:40] <1killersquirrel> @Klean weird question, do you remmeber the Bronze watch quest to be different than it is now? with the watch being found in multiple locations on Customs or on Interchange?

[2022-12-26 00:14:01] <1killersquirrel> Then why is ChatGPT saying this when I ask how to do the quest? Find the Bronze watch: "The Bronze watch can be found in a few different locations, including on the body of a dead scav in the laboratory on the Customs map, on the body of a dead scav in the dorms on the Customs map, or in a crate in the car dealership on the Interchange map."
[2022-12-26 00:14:04] <bazookagamedev> at this stage thats all that matters

[2022-12-26 00:14:18] <1killersquirrel> And then this is the most interesting: "Take the Bronze watch to Prapor: Once you have found the Bronze watch, you will need to take it to Prapor, who is located in the Flea Market on the Customs map. You can do this by either using the Flea Market tab in the main menu or by visiting Prapor in person."

[2022-12-26 00:27:01] <@%Ring> The real chad move is to wait a few weeks before playing the new wipe to see if the game is still riddled with cheaters and if it is you footwork the whole wipe and wait for the next one EZY 🤙

[2022-12-26 00:40:52] <5hoo> @wubnoxious after googling to refresh myself it looks likw the drops are usually "new years drops" not specifically wipe drops so probably not pushed back
[2022-12-26 00:40:54] <%wubnoxious> I miss scav gangin

[2022-12-26 00:41:48] <%wubnoxious> yeah its usually like TP and food and stuff when its that early into wipe
[2022-12-26 00:42:06] <5hoo> depends, sometimes the drop pool is everything and I got a keytool 3rd day of my playing the wipe @wubnoxious

[2022-12-26 01:41:39] <hornas> @chops_games both
[2022-12-26 01:41:53] <%+kevincarson89> Imagine if that was your perspective in the game @Klean you're not a PMC you're a scav trying to make a home in Tarkov. Economics from Tarkov Kappa

[2022-12-26 01:42:40] <chops_games> @hornas well to let you know i have a 3070ti with a ryzen 9 5900x with 32 gb of ram. when i stream it still looks a little pixelated. so not sure how much you want to spend but my PC was over 3k
[2022-12-26 01:42:59] <evil_din> ok, thx
[2022-12-26 01:43:27] <chops_games> @hornas i know you said you didnt want to spend much money though so not sure what it would look like with a lower end PC trying to game and stream
[2022-12-26 01:43:47] <hornas> @chops_games damn thats a beasty pc, do you stream using that new gpu tech?
[2022-12-26 01:44:26] <SharkToothAU> Tarkov hates encoders, no matter how good your rig is, you will always get pixelation playing eft

[2022-12-26 01:56:44] <JackHazard666> @RayZeuRes Or they could have slings
[2022-12-26 01:56:48] <+FatherOwens> @rayzeures good idea, you would do that irl

[2022-12-26 01:57:05] <@%$Ripper203> Yeah Tarky used to be a lot slower and methodical but it's evolved a fair bit over time

[2022-12-26 02:12:43] <%ItsRender> There going to eventually add an arena mode where i believe you can just spawn stuff in. Thats not in yet. But right now, you can capture different monsters, and prisoners, then have them fight eachother. Set the surrounding area as a tavern so people go to watch and then the center of the bit a dungeon
[2022-12-26 02:12:46] <%+Lukivah> it even simulates crying. if you look at their body parts while crying it will have liquid in both eyes LuL

[2022-12-26 02:39:59] <Cpt_kek> @Klean Hello, I played Dwarf Fortress for a bit and it seemed a bit to easy. Was that just my experience? All the basic needs for my dwarfs are very easy to fulfill and I did not find a challenge in the game. Maybe I did not play for long enough, decided to ask
[2022-12-26 02:40:33] <dextermorgan800> @Cpt_kek i got similar vibe

[2022-12-26 02:42:51] <+Voromiir> @Cpt_kek The best way i've heard Dwarf Fortress described is that the world isn't out to get you, like other games, you are just seven dwarves trying to start a new life. Shii can and will happen and it's up to you to defend yourself from it, or you could just start wars. There are many ways to make the game more difficult.
[2022-12-26 02:42:58] <Tmmy2ooTuff> I know the need for war is very human of me
[2022-12-26 02:43:01] <Cpt_kek> @Pestimism Maybe just not my type of game, makes for a great chill stream thou
[2022-12-26 02:43:33] <Cpt_kek> @Voromiir I guess
[2022-12-26 02:44:04] <Pestimism> I thought I had a sick embark yesterday and was all hype to get my fort going, then a magma man killed everyone before I even had a farm going. Good times
[2022-12-26 02:44:11] <+Voromiir> This is definitely a chill and relax game, let your imagination take you places, and just do what you feel is best/fun/proper at the time.

[2022-12-26 03:07:11] <Pestimism> One frame skip was added last update

[2022-12-26 03:15:58] <+Robnada> @Klean You can set your military dwarves to wear armor all the time, so they don't get stuck in the endless loop of changing. It's in the squad schedule menu, edit. Then equip always, not equip on orders
[2022-12-26 03:16:00] <+InCrIpTiOn> I keep them training always, feed them good meals and put them near wealth they wont get sad
[2022-12-26 03:16:16] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean can you fix the armor rack issue by putting the armor rack in a "owned" space like a barracks or bedroom? Perhaps an "owned door" if you can do that?
[2022-12-26 03:16:22] <%MagicMeech> yea i had 101 pop an a 10k pound web shooting spider only killed like 5 people

[2022-12-26 04:17:39] <%ItsRender> This game is easily better then Rimworld. Its not even a competition LUL. I say that with the most respect towards Rimworld, cause that's a great game.

[2022-12-26 04:32:09] <tw1tch_tex> one thing i was heard too for helping with lag with stairs is, if you wanna have that 3x3 space, it cuts down on their possible pathing options to have it as an X with only 5 stairs instead of 9
[2022-12-26 04:32:35] <PoopyMcFartass> thats how often they check the order, not how much they make everyday

[2022-12-26 04:37:58] <%Ljosapaldr> @lord_ubah No fork needed, I have it from the current maintainer, it's just a slight change to the software + a memory layout, that's also why it can't write to the game yet, the work details mess stuff up.

[2022-12-26 04:57:43] <lordperrywinkle> will the elves get angry about the trees?
[2022-12-26 04:57:44] <+jerbil_b> I think the burrows bug out with more than like 100 dwarves
[2022-12-26 04:57:46] <+broms122> civilian alerts used to do that in the pre-steam verison, they don't seem to have been added to steam yet
[2022-12-26 04:57:48] <%+HeliossXD> dorf smol hed, smol brain
[2022-12-26 04:57:55] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean it's an oversight apparently that civil alert didn't make it into v50 rbzKekwii so you should get that feature eventually
[2022-12-26 04:57:57] <Khaladen> Does it work if you hit burrow, then go to the citizen screen and manually cancel their jobs?
[2022-12-26 04:57:57] <+MrFloomp> I mean, plants are very fun to pick though.

[2022-12-26 04:58:36] <OmgVulpix> You had that minus the burrow bullshit
[2022-12-26 04:58:39] <%Ljosapaldr> the only solution to burrows being dumb is just making your dwarves not go outside to begin with, really
[2022-12-26 04:58:41] <Janzert> @broms122 apparently they're still in the underlying game just didn't make it into the revamped UI so I expect they'll come back eventually
