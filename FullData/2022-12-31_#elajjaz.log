[2022-12-31 15:35:52] <%Vortalization> magnezone has sturdy and weakness policy so it's best to stall it out, use some bulky mon and will-o-wisp the motherfucker
[2022-12-31 15:36:18] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> it also dynamaxes during the fight pepeW

[2022-12-31 15:41:30] <%Vortalization> in all honesty, fire type mon is best for magnezone, pyroar with adaptability could work. Magnezone has Flash Cannon (steel) Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice. So something that isn't weak like a fire mon would work. @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment
[2022-12-31 15:41:30] <%$ToxicBurrito> GARFING Lookege true gamer rage
[2022-12-31 15:41:59] <%Vortalization> @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment, fast mons are very welcome on the team, because hers aren't EV trained beside Magnezone
[2022-12-31 15:42:38] <%Vortalization> so outspeeding Rotom who will most likely paralyze you and Manectric that hits very had is ther smarter idea @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment
[2022-12-31 15:42:51] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> only they all get +2 special attack when they enter the fight because she juices them YEP
[2022-12-31 15:42:54] <%$ToxicBurrito> elaHmm elaPlan
[2022-12-31 15:43:04] <%Vortalization> Vikavolt can be just walled with some bulky rock mon and rock attacks @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment

[2022-12-31 20:47:24] <%Pandushe> just appreciate the womenization of historical characters
[2022-12-31 20:47:32] <%Quifenadine> actually
[2022-12-31 20:47:37] <%Quifenadine> why is every historical character
[2022-12-31 20:47:39] <%Quifenadine> a girl
[2022-12-31 20:47:42] <%Quifenadine> in fate
[2022-12-31 20:47:42] <DeviousBonkk> why not
[2022-12-31 20:47:47] <%Quifenadine> well
[2022-12-31 20:47:48] <%Quifenadine> because

[2022-12-31 20:47:58] <%Quifenadine> BUT
[2022-12-31 20:48:02] <%zoibergOne> cause girls need representation

[2022-12-31 20:48:08] <%zoibergOne> and what better representation there is
[2022-12-31 20:48:12] <%Pandushe> well if you want to know, the characters can literally be anything
[2022-12-31 20:48:15] <%zoibergOne> then to turn a male into a female
[2022-12-31 20:48:21] <%zoibergOne> 3Heading
[2022-12-31 20:48:22] <%Quifenadine> so they can be both girl and boy?
[2022-12-31 20:48:25] <%Pandushe> in fate night the assassin class was a literal made up character from some dudes fanfic
[2022-12-31 20:48:33] <%Quifenadine> HUH
