At the time, it was called engellisches horn, which meant "angelic horn" in Middle High German, because it was thought to resemble the horns played by angels in religious imagery.

[2022-12-07 18:10:07] <jpettis002> @mediocritical yeah you're right, but a decent French horn player can play a decent portion of other instruments parts, like trumpet saxophone and clarinet/flute just for starters

[2022-12-07 18:10:08] <%+Mediocritical> @jpettis002 most casual music listeners are impressed by powerful bass or shrill treble and the fhorn just sits in the middle doing its thing
