[2023-01-07 08:44:19] <JonVoyager> they patched that already
[2023-01-07 08:44:24] <BAMrhino> Could go the rocket league route and change crates/loot boxes to rarity drops that are given from the pass
[2023-01-07 08:44:29] <+TheBuster_> How is that happening?
[2023-01-07 08:44:38] <%$fr7end> oh ofcourse jq is good against rein and brig the 2 most played heroes in the game

[2023-01-07 08:45:01] <clobbinpuss_> Saying loot boxes are not good is redundant all they have to do is show odds and have them as optional purchases I think they would do well that way

[2023-01-07 08:58:47] <+TimeliestTank> the fact that melee bleed stacks is kinda sick
[2023-01-07 08:59:03] <%ElTragedy> if queen got gold or some shit duirng rampage, i think then she could cook a little
[2023-01-07 08:59:08] <clobbinpuss_> I'm not ready for this hog changes NotLikeThis
[2023-01-07 08:59:12] <thaaad> all bleeds stack don't they?
[2023-01-07 08:59:18] <beardedlink> It‚Äôs been like 3 games since I heard one of your teammates call out anything

[2023-01-07 08:59:45] <clobbinpuss_> @guru  it's happening mid to late January When hog gets changed
[2023-01-07 08:59:46] <%HellCastleBTW> they said no hog changes until the end of this month sooo, u have time to climb and bully in comp
[2023-01-07 08:59:48] <%Amhash1> I don‚Äôt get why they haven‚Äôt just changed hogs damage numbers so he can‚Äôt one shot
[2023-01-07 08:59:55] <%Amhash1> That‚Äôs literally his biggest issue
[2023-01-07 09:00:12] <whackipedia> if orisa and hog got  erfed JQ would be more exciting

[2023-01-07 09:00:52] <%NEST0R23> Hog will finally fly with the rework

[2023-01-07 09:01:47] <+Detroit_Desu> the hook and heal are integral to hog so it'll be very interesting
[2023-01-07 09:01:58] <clobbinpuss_> @tarek_734 they said he's one shot is being nerfed and his kit will / might be reworked
