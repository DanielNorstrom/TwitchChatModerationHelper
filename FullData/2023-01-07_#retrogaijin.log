[2023-01-07 08:22:39] <!%+Nbg13> might start have to watch VOD's soon, will be the only way i will see any streams LUL
[2023-01-07 08:23:02] <!%+Nbg13> although they are not teh same as live which is why i normally dont't like watching them
[2023-01-07 08:23:08] <!%+Nbg13> not the same experience

[2023-01-07 08:25:19] <@%+Jonno107> Ah, yeah :(
[2023-01-07 08:25:56] <@%+Jonno107> I got the VOD channel started again, will be uploading as many VOD's as I can from now on
[2023-01-07 08:27:02] <@%+Jonno107> Definitely not the same as live, but it can be fun to rewatch/catch up on stuff from time to time!
[2023-01-07 08:29:20] <@%+Jonno107> Hopefully that command helps a lot more people discover the channel as well, most people didn't know about it

[2023-01-07 11:47:15] <%Game_Ov3r> are you going to upload all of the vods to the yt?
[2023-01-07 11:49:31] <@%+Jonno107> As far back as I can, which is starting with the first Sonic Frontiers stream! 2nd VOD is still processing, I think.
