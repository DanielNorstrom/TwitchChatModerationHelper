[2023-01-09 16:27:58] <!%+AirahsELL> there is an elite beat agents/ouendan PC game where people made their own track maps, if you wanna try it out it's called Osu!
[2023-01-09 16:28:06] <TalkingObject> What about genocide run
[2023-01-09 16:28:11] <CopyGamerTwitch> Idk, I didn't enjoy it enough to play any route besides neutral
[2023-01-09 16:28:18] <SassySlayer69> if they make a mobile version of undertale then Id play
[2023-01-09 16:28:19] <%Proteus42> LUL
[2023-01-09 16:28:29] <SassySlayer69> it looks fun
[2023-01-09 16:28:40] <%Proteus42> Undertale is a masterpiece for a 16 bit style game.
[2023-01-09 16:28:41] <%Rarefoil> it's on the Switch @sassyslayer69

[2023-01-09 16:29:01] <!%+AirahsELL> playing genocide is just very grindy and kinda pointless since the Sans boss fight exists as whats essentially a free flash game.

[2023-01-09 16:29:28] <%marklarphd> The most impressive thing about Undertale is how well the OST expresses the story

[2023-01-09 16:29:46] <rayjeezie406> The original FF7 is a A, the remake is a S
[2023-01-09 16:29:48] <SassySlayer69> (unless its pokemon)
[2023-01-09 16:29:48] <%Furudehan> A or S.
[2023-01-09 16:29:51] <ob1alex29> ff7 S OR A
[2023-01-09 16:29:57] <AgentCobalt> hi Olivia olivia50Wave
[2023-01-09 16:29:57] <!%Catbag> at least A
[2023-01-09 16:29:59] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Probably A
[2023-01-09 16:30:00] <%Proteus42> oh yea the FF7 remake is so good
[2023-01-09 16:30:01] <%$firedragonsreturn> A
[2023-01-09 16:30:04] <%RabidBeefalo> in the not yet played :)
[2023-01-09 16:30:05] <Melnazar> The most impressive things about Undertale is how everyone who makes voices for the characters makes ^Papyrus' voice like skeletor's.
[2023-01-09 16:30:05] <!%Catbag> ok i'm fine with that
[2023-01-09 16:30:09] <+Abstract_Endurance> @rayjeezie406 remakes aren’t even done yet though
[2023-01-09 16:30:14] <+BlindGoblin13> I haven't played almost any of these games :c
[2023-01-09 16:30:16] <!%+AirahsELL> original is like a B. remake is so low that it fell off the tier list and landed in the garbage.
[2023-01-09 16:30:17] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> I abstain from rating FF7
[2023-01-09 16:30:22] <AgentCobalt> whoa Oli sounds different meiyaPause
[2023-01-09 16:30:26] <scarletmikasa> i love ff7 a lot but it definitely goes in A

[2023-01-09 16:30:40] <Redamaford> I think FF7 is pretty overrated, but I also really like FF5 and 8 and 9 instead, I'm that kind of person.
[2023-01-09 16:30:43] <%$MaxDOutEX> But I thought Goofy was in KH...

[2023-01-09 16:31:10] <%Proteus42> I loved FF7 but yea it isn't perfect.

[2023-01-09 16:31:15] <%Furudehan> 7 was pretty defining. Not my favorite FF but I acknowledge it as one of the best.
[2023-01-09 16:31:18] <+Abstract_Endurance> S
[2023-01-09 16:31:19] <%Rarefoil> S for me
[2023-01-09 16:31:20] <TalkingObject> P for Portal
[2023-01-09 16:31:21] <%Seamoni> it sounds like you have hot takes
[2023-01-09 16:31:23] <!%+AirahsELL> materia is pretty easy to get. link passive skills to an active skill to boost it.

[2023-01-09 16:31:26] <$Dakmoonshadow> also S, but that's just me.

[2023-01-09 16:31:53] <@%DrGoodStrats> Only big brained chads put portal in S
[2023-01-09 16:31:54] <%Rarefoil> I mean, Portal is incredible important to my growth as a gamer so it goes into S no matter what
[2023-01-09 16:32:01] <@%Athagorn> Olivia is a bit sick, that's why she's sounding different today.

[2023-01-09 16:32:10] <%Furudehan> Portal was too charming not to love. If you didn't like the story more than the puzzles, then it's probably not for you.

[2023-01-09 16:34:01] <%archiveBird> I'm also somebody who is very bad at video games so I'm more interested in a fun/interesting experience that I can get through olivia50Load
[2023-01-09 16:34:05] <%Proteus42> nice
[2023-01-09 16:34:10] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> Funny enough, there was a FPS  that used the portal mechanic before Portal, but Portal for sure did it better giving the player the control of the portals and using for puzzles
[2023-01-09 16:34:10] <SassySlayer69> your voice is sk soothing auroraphComfy

[2023-01-09 16:35:03] <%Rarefoil> So you beat Paper Mario right?
[2023-01-09 16:35:03] <+Abstract_Endurance> hot take, Persona 4 is better than 5
[2023-01-09 16:35:06] <%RabidBeefalo> @catbag  banjo is rapidly approaching our location

[2023-01-09 16:35:17] <@%DrGoodStrats> I onyl didn't put paper mario in S because I put TTYD in S and it's better than paper mario for sure.
[2023-01-09 16:35:19] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> So far mostly agree with this list, I'd move some stuff 1 tier, but this is fine
[2023-01-09 16:35:25] <ob1alex29> the thousand year door is a or S paper mario 1 and 2 are good
[2023-01-09 16:35:28] <%Parasocial69> I am still amazed at how quickly Olivia has progressed through all these classic vidya gaemz
[2023-01-09 16:35:34] <!%+AirahsELL> @abstract_endurance thats not a hot take thats just kinda truth. though im not a fan of persona in general

[2023-01-09 16:36:03] <!%ZiBookishGamer> high praise for OG Paper Mario, if I find a way to play it, I'll have to add it to the backlog
[2023-01-09 16:36:04] <!%Fuzzgotgames> The original is the passion project
[2023-01-09 16:36:06] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> Both are great and i'd have em same tier personally.
[2023-01-09 16:36:07] <%GinTamashiVT> I was cool until now lol
[2023-01-09 16:36:11] <%Furudehan> Didn't play any Marios after 64. Paper Mario was good only that it was a spiritual sequel to Mario rpg.
[2023-01-09 16:36:11] <@%DrGoodStrats> Honestly they are both pretty S tier games
[2023-01-09 16:36:29] <+Abstract_Endurance> @airahsell I mostly say it to rile up the people who only ever played 5 and its sequels
[2023-01-09 16:36:31] <%JayBusch> I really like the original, but TTYD is still a very good game.
[2023-01-09 16:36:33] <%Lillowh> I should stop being lazy and play the paper games since I love Mario rpg
[2023-01-09 16:36:34] <%rianogard> did you enjoy TTYD as much as portal?
[2023-01-09 16:36:36] <%Parasocial69> wut about the OG "Mario RPG"

[2023-01-09 16:36:58] <!%+AirahsELL> ttyd does make things more complex and judging by your tastes you tend to prefer simpler systems so you can focus on the story more as opposed to breaking out a spreadsheet just to beat up the dragon of gatekeeping
[2023-01-09 16:36:59] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> Paper Mario is simple as a RPG but not insulting your intelligence simple.

[2023-01-09 16:37:41] <%Seamoni> the gameplay got better as the series progresses, but the story got too complicated.

[2023-01-09 16:47:41] <!%+AirahsELL> thats how resident evil games were before 4. the second run is meant to be much faster since you know where everything is. its a clever way of stretching the games runtime since a single run doesnt even break 10hrs

[2023-01-09 17:07:54] <%TheChrisWit> I’d say a tier for GameCube, and s tier for the Wii trilogy remake

[2023-01-09 17:08:08] <%Furudehan> Hated Prime. You saw me put it in D. Metroid should've stayed 2D.
[2023-01-09 17:08:08] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> @Rarefoil Yeah, it leans toward the left4dead gameplay with the minecraft resource gathering, but cel-shaded like borderlands 2. Fun fun game. Space dwarves vs space bugs
[2023-01-09 17:08:10] <%$sumofty> what did the Wii one add?
[2023-01-09 17:08:11] <CopyGamerTwitch> Metroid Prime 4 where?
[2023-01-09 17:08:11] <%Rarefoil> Come to think it I ranked games I didn't beat on my Tier list so I should not shame Oli for only getting 1 Shadow ending
[2023-01-09 17:08:12] <%GamesGetGot> also good call on prime for S tier
[2023-01-09 17:08:13] <thelegendarytrainer23> I like metroid prime tge exploration is pretty satisfying and has the best fight with meta ridley

[2023-01-09 17:23:08] <%Rarefoil> @kiri_guy She only beat one ending so she can't appreciate all of its genius Kappa

[2023-01-09 17:23:16] <!%+AirahsELL> shadow as a single run is a B. it gets bumped down to C once you realize you need to replay it 10x for true end
[2023-01-09 17:23:16] <%TheChrisWit> @sumofty for nostalgia
[2023-01-09 17:23:17] <%Furudehan> I've gotten every ending. It should be higher.
[2023-01-09 17:23:22] <%+TsarBomba9271> fusion better then super
[2023-01-09 17:23:24] <@%arcanumghost> I was so excited for shadow the hedgehog, it's got lots to be sad about

[2023-01-09 17:23:30] <%$sumofty> @TheChrisWit that game was notably terrible even at the time lmao

[2023-01-09 17:23:49] <@%DrGoodStrats> Very diplomatic moistLUL
[2023-01-09 17:23:50] <!%Fuzzgotgames> There is a lot of great stuff in fusion. Like I think fusion does horror the best
[2023-01-09 17:23:51] <%ZataraSWE> I honestly thought banjo tooie would even make it on the list LUL
[2023-01-09 17:23:51] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> A lot of people grew up with that game. I grew up with NES Roger Rabbit. I can say Shadow is better than that, I still love Roger Rabbit on NES, but I would say recommending someone play that is probably against Geneva Convention terms.
[2023-01-09 17:24:01] <%trublu1003> now your talkin. All A's

[2023-01-09 17:24:08] <%Lillowh> Super is also mind blowing considering it came out in 94
[2023-01-09 17:24:10] <%TheChrisWit> @fuzzgotgames I was legit scared of sa-x, fusion did it’s job
[2023-01-09 17:24:22] <@%DrGoodStrats> Don';t pretend it isn't our fault LUL
[2023-01-09 17:24:23] <$Dakmoonshadow> If you like fusion. You'll like dread.
[2023-01-09 17:24:24] <%Rarefoil> Play it again on Easy?
[2023-01-09 17:24:25] <%+TsarBomba9271> got to play easy mode for story
[2023-01-09 17:24:29] <CptTinko> fusion was my first metroid and i loved it on GBA
[2023-01-09 17:24:31] <%+TsarBomba9271> always go easy for story

[2023-01-09 17:24:57] <@%arcanumghost> these are very fun games
[2023-01-09 17:24:57] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> That the DS version or the Wii one?
[2023-01-09 17:24:58] <%trublu1003> What kind of game name is that???
[2023-01-09 17:25:00] <%ReinhardtZelkova> I 100% cleared Dread on every difficulty except Dread mode because I'm not THAT much of a masochist
[2023-01-09 17:25:03] <%ZataraSWE> any game you ever have tried hard mode on?
[2023-01-09 17:25:05] <%GinTamashiVT> I wish they still had Trauma Center games. I wanted to play that as a kid
[2023-01-09 17:25:07] <+Abstract_Endurance> Trauma Center is Persona but good

[2023-01-09 17:25:19] <!%+AirahsELL> ive seen Trauma Center. it looks really fun but i dont really wanna use the wii or ds gimmicks to play it.
[2023-01-09 17:25:35] <%Cronofuge> S for me, but game is hard
[2023-01-09 17:25:35] <%trublu1003> In other words, Oli hasn't challenged herself enough
[2023-01-09 17:25:44] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> Did it earlier this year actually, then took 2 days off gaming and cooking from hand injuries from the last boss.
[2023-01-09 17:25:48] <spongeofmystery> If this goes in anything other than S tier I will drive to your house and pelt it with wasps' nests
[2023-01-09 17:25:50] <ladyvertleanbox> i love fea is a good game @OliviaMonroe
[2023-01-09 17:25:50] <%Furudehan> I can't play any game below hard mode.
[2023-01-09 17:26:01] <!%+AirahsELL> "game was good but i took an hour on a single jump therefore points docked"
[2023-01-09 17:26:01] <%Rarefoil> Oh you did enjoy it? I didn't get that impression
[2023-01-09 17:26:07] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> Well earlier last year, but yes.

[2023-01-09 17:29:43] <!%Fuzzgotgames> you grinded SO MUCH for that game, and ffx is unique in that it is the worst game in the series for grinding. Chat has no idea
[2023-01-09 17:29:46] <!%+AirahsELL> considering when it came out all rpgs round that time are grindy if you ignore sidequesting (which are their own grind)

[2023-01-09 17:34:07] <%Rarefoil> it is one of the best games of all time

[2023-01-09 17:34:13] <CliffMcConaireVT> This is such an eclectic game selection for a tier list lol
[2023-01-09 17:34:15] <%+hashtag420yoloswaqmonster> someone had to code how Mario jumped around planets. I always thought that was nuts as a kid

[2023-01-09 17:34:25] <@%DrGoodStrats> Galaxy? The best 3d mario? Easily the worst. It's basically a straight line. It's so linear
[2023-01-09 17:34:25] <%BlackConvoy> Super Mario Galaxy is an honest masterpiece.
[2023-01-09 17:34:28] <%trublu1003> The music, the graphics, the gameplay. It's so good
[2023-01-09 17:34:30] <%sleepy_moohnie> @melnazar my dentist had a gamecube with pokemon xd gale of darkness on it :D
[2023-01-09 17:34:37] <+Ungadyne> linear isn't inherently a flaw
[2023-01-09 17:34:46] <%sleepy_moohnie> its actually how i learned about the game ^^

[2023-01-09 17:34:47] <%marklarphd> Mario 64 was one of the first 3D platformers, so in context it's amazing how much they nailed it
[2023-01-09 17:34:54] <Daverost> @DrGoodStrats It's a tour of set pieces. It's nice for that, but it's definitely that.

[2023-01-09 17:36:32] <!%+Stamina_Jay> I had Iris back on the ps2 and I bought ryza about a year ago
[2023-01-09 17:36:37] <+Abstract_Endurance> Rysa’s thighs brought in a lot of new fans

[2023-01-09 17:37:39] <%TechnoSugarCreations> I agree. Sonic Forces was far from perfect as a Sonic game, but it was still very enjoyable and the soundtrack is FIRE.
[2023-01-09 17:37:41] <ladyvertleanbox> i reccomend the pirate warriors series @OliviaMonroe

[2023-01-09 17:38:13] <!%+AirahsELL> are you gonna play any of the ateliers on stream or is that too much of a personal game?

[2023-01-09 17:38:16] <@%Athagorn> Forces was the one we were trying to create the ugliest character ever?

[2023-01-09 17:38:37] <!%+Stamina_Jay> Games should be fun to play otherwise what is the point. even if you want a super hard game it still has to be fun to play

[2023-01-09 17:38:59] <Daverost> My biggest problem with it is that they made a new engine and the engine barely worked.

[2023-01-09 17:39:07] <!%+AirahsELL> that's most peoples problem with it.
[2023-01-09 17:39:09] <%Megaket> I liked Forces, but it's very short and the levels are extremely linear
[2023-01-09 17:39:11] <%Natal_KOG> they hate it because the internet told them to ludwig24Notasian

[2023-01-09 17:39:55] <%TechnoSugarCreations> My only 2 real beefs with Forces were Classic Sonic's physics and small parts of the story, like when Sonic had allegedly been tortured for 6 months and yet when we see him, he doesn't have a scratch on him.

[2023-01-09 17:44:35] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I remember you wanted to blast through it, and you seemed to be having fun, but when you were underpowered and had no chance against the stuff in the late game and you had to grind sidequests, everything grinded to a halt

[2023-01-09 17:54:12] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I like that the story content in breath of the wild is mostly optional
[2023-01-09 17:54:31] <%Laempchen> and then still forget everything you learn in the tutorial KEKW

[2023-01-09 17:54:49] <!%+AirahsELL> BotW is mid but thats because I've played so many open world games like it that it didnt do anything for me. and I did all 120 shrines.
[2023-01-09 17:54:57] <%GinTamashiVT> Do you think you will play the sequel?
[2023-01-09 17:55:02] <%BlackConvoy> @airahsell did you ever play the Tecmo Warriors game? it's worse than FEW. I honestly don't think FEW is all that bad either.

[2023-01-09 17:55:20] <@%DrGoodStrats> BotW leans too much on exploration, so once you know the whole maps it's super boring on a second playthrough.
[2023-01-09 17:55:32] <+Abstract_Endurance> the weapon durability thing takes it down a tier for me

[2023-01-09 17:56:52] <!%+AirahsELL> @drgoodstrats nah the shrines are fine replacements for the hidden holes in a normal zelda game. the issue is the divine beasts. they are really poor dungeons and their bosses all looking the same didnt help.

[2023-01-09 18:07:41] <%BlackConvoy> Echoes is a step down from Fates. That being said, Echoes is a better version of Gaiden.

[2023-01-09 18:08:57] <Leon27607> the point of roguelikes is to get the upgrades so even if you die you still have progression
[2023-01-09 18:09:00] <%fz5_94> its a progression through learning from mistake

[2023-01-09 18:09:23] <!%+AirahsELL> getting into roguelikes involves selling people who are used to in game progression on player progression. the little upgrades you get dont help you nearly as much as just getting better at the game.

[2023-01-09 18:27:30] <%BlackConvoy> Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3/6, and Live A Live are the holy trinity of SNES RPGs.

[2023-01-09 18:32:10] <%trublu1003> Twilight Princess, but it's very close between the two
[2023-01-09 18:32:12] <%MayShip> Wind Waker feels more grand and it has an amazing art style
[2023-01-09 18:32:12] <%Sotetsu> Twilight Princess was the first Zelda game where I really loved the NPCs and story.

[2023-01-09 18:39:34] <!%+AirahsELL> bayonetta 3 is the best in the franchise. problem is one of the playable characters is really mechanically different and not as fun to use. and the ending soured a lotta people on it.

[2023-01-09 19:09:13] <@%BlackCharcz> Definitely I'd focus on FPS, adventures et al, since those are best played on PC.
[2023-01-09 19:09:13] <CptTinko> most indie games are pc exclusive, but those by definition stay relatively small

[2023-01-09 19:09:52] <%Paranormal_Instigator> The PC was a lot of CRPG, Simulation, and Adventure games

[2023-01-09 19:18:16] <%Cronofuge> its so niche
[2023-01-09 19:18:20] <!%+AirahsELL> its according to the people who bothered to leave a review on metacritic.
[2023-01-09 19:18:22] <%angeryaboutelves> factorio is a really niche game i feel like

[2023-01-09 19:24:50] <%Hentaiwatcher_> starting league of legends is a dangerous path
[2023-01-09 19:24:53] <$Aiakos_VEVO> eh
[2023-01-09 19:24:56] <%+shibiririreruwa> Yes yes yes
[2023-01-09 19:24:56] <%KylarDSA> yes
[2023-01-09 19:24:57] <%MalcyWithaK> no
[2023-01-09 19:24:57] <%$sumofty> Quake is must play BUT you need the version with the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack olivia50Hoho
[2023-01-09 19:24:57] <YourOwnSun> YES
[2023-01-09 19:24:58] <+Abstract_Endurance> no
[2023-01-09 19:24:58] <%+VoluXian> It is imo
[2023-01-09 19:24:58] <!%+AirahsELL> quake or Unreal.
[2023-01-09 19:24:58] <%Rarefoil> yes
[2023-01-09 19:24:58] <nox_nyctores> Ehhhh
[2023-01-09 19:24:59] <%angeryaboutelves> if you like doom, sure
[2023-01-09 19:24:59] <%devriestron> Quake 1...nah.
[2023-01-09 19:25:01] <%$muzcheena> yes
[2023-01-09 19:25:02] <!%+AirahsELL> both are good
[2023-01-09 19:25:02] <$Aiakos_VEVO> quake's single player is kind of bland
[2023-01-09 19:25:03] <%ArkOfTurus> If you love the OG Doom, play Quake.
[2023-01-09 19:25:03] <frankenatorgaming> i guess?
[2023-01-09 19:25:05] <%Womperschnitzel> Quake is as much a must play as the original Doom
[2023-01-09 19:25:05] <%ArcReaper_21> yes
[2023-01-09 19:25:06] <@%BlackCharcz> quake is interesting I'd go for quake 3 arena instead
[2023-01-09 19:25:07] <Tylphen> Quake 2 better
[2023-01-09 19:25:09] <%Lillowh> Quake is good to check out but no need to complete it
[2023-01-09 19:25:10] <%Sotetsu> If you're playing OG Doom and Half-Life 1, you can probably skip Quake.
[2023-01-09 19:25:10] <%Paranormal_Instigator> if you like OG doom quake you'll like quake
[2023-01-09 19:25:12] <%fantasticbovine> Quake is good
[2023-01-09 19:25:15] <%$sumofty> If you play Quake without the NIN soundtrack, the game is like a 5/10
[2023-01-09 19:25:15] <%Rarefoil> Quake 1 is a must play
[2023-01-09 19:25:16] <Diabetic> Quake 1 is OK, Doom does it all eventaully
[2023-01-09 19:25:17] <nox_nyctores> Honestly for Quake the MP is more important than the singleplayer
[2023-01-09 19:25:20] <%Ponycron> Quake 1 got remaster a while back, worth it
[2023-01-09 19:25:21] <%Womperschnitzel> Quake is very similar
[2023-01-09 19:25:21] VIEWERS: 421
[2023-01-09 19:25:23] <%devriestron> If you like OG Doom I would instead play Duke Nukem or Blood or something like that
[2023-01-09 19:25:23] <%trublu1003> You can actually...not that I would know
[2023-01-09 19:25:28] <frankenatorgaming> oli wants to be slayed by doom guy
[2023-01-09 19:25:29] <%ChibiDeviChaosCH> quake wasnt really succesfull because of single player
[2023-01-09 19:25:30] <$Aiakos_VEVO> banger
[2023-01-09 19:25:33] <!%+WHYTEA> olivia50Lol
[2023-01-09 19:25:33] <newtonia09> ......
[2023-01-09 19:25:35] <%socialistOtter> quake is pretty great but like it depends how much you like OG Doom. if you like it a lot you probably will like Quake
[2023-01-09 19:25:35] <frankenatorgaming> he manly
[2023-01-09 19:25:36] <%Sotetsu> I'll take one. Put it on my bill.

[2023-01-09 19:25:45] <@%BlackCharcz> it's an entire genre - boomer shooters. I'd try another one like quake to see if you like it in general

[2023-01-09 19:25:54] <%+Enygmus> og DOOM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT DOOM II IS EVEN BETTER IN MY OP

[2023-01-09 19:26:10] <nox_nyctores> I'd propose Return to Castle Wolfenstein over Quake for a classic style FPS

[2023-01-09 19:26:26] <%$Steelthrone> it's pretty rude. I'd recommend saints row for a sillier game
[2023-01-09 19:26:26] <%Rarefoil> GTA DID start as PC exclusive

[2023-01-09 19:30:47] <%Womperschnitzel> Witcher 3 was so good
[2023-01-09 19:30:49] <newtonia09> I would suggest witcher 2 first
[2023-01-09 19:30:55] <%+shibiririreruwa> Wticher 3 is a masterpiece. Not a stream game though
[2023-01-09 19:30:56] <%MalcyWithaK> The evil people from spy kids?

[2023-01-09 19:31:37] <%Sotetsu> I love Stardew Valley so much. It is the comfiest game ever.
[2023-01-09 19:31:39] <%$sumofty> when you hit a certain age, the concept of stardew is like "I can just do chores at my own actual house"
[2023-01-09 19:31:41] <%MayShip> "my moms in the hospital" "oh that reminds me about Stardew Valley"
[2023-01-09 19:31:41] <%itsKokonee> olivia50Hoho

[2023-01-09 19:31:45] <%JayBusch> Stardew Valley doesn’t jive with me, but it’s got so much passion poured into it.
[2023-01-09 19:31:52] <%Womperschnitzel> Stardew Valley is basically Animal Crossing with a bit more game to it
[2023-01-09 19:31:55] <%+VoluXian> Stardew is great, but I always feel rushed when I play it LUL
[2023-01-09 19:31:56] <%Hentaiwatcher_> also it's still getting updates!
[2023-01-09 19:32:02] <!%+AirahsELL> its basically a harvest moon game

[2023-01-09 19:34:29] <$Aiakos_VEVO> the first one was good for the time but the series dragged on
[2023-01-09 19:34:29] <%$Markxonme> ME is a game to try at least once
[2023-01-09 19:34:30] <%+VoluXian> The next Dragon Age will release... eventually
[2023-01-09 19:34:30] <%ArkOfTurus> I liked the first Dragon Age at the time. That's about it.
[2023-01-09 19:34:31] <%MalcyWithaK> This was someones opinion based list
[2023-01-09 19:34:36] <%Grawne> Not so much of a streaming game
[2023-01-09 19:34:36] <!%+AirahsELL> dragon age 2 is the one that's regarded as the best.
[2023-01-09 19:34:39] <%ArcReaper_21> I would have picked origins over inquisition
[2023-01-09 19:34:43] <%+shibiririreruwa> Mass Effect is way better
[2023-01-09 19:34:46] <%Natal_KOG> of course Skyrim is here
[2023-01-09 19:34:48] <%Hentaiwatcher_> i wonder what's number 1
[2023-01-09 19:34:49] <%angeryaboutelves> mass effect has aged better than dragon age
[2023-01-09 19:34:51] <%$Steelthrone> mass effect

[2023-01-09 19:34:53] <%AllHailKingJulian> This list: "Based? Based on someone's opinion"
[2023-01-09 19:34:54] <+Abstract_Endurance> Dragon Age 2 is the best? what universe is this?
[2023-01-09 19:34:56] <%Zokaryaplays> @Aiakos_VEVO The series dragged on for ages
[2023-01-09 19:34:56] <%Womperschnitzel> I tried to play Dragon Age: Origins twice but got bored and quit both times
[2023-01-09 19:34:57] <newtonia09> Mass Effect is Great!

[2023-01-09 19:46:33] <%+PedroYuuhi> I kinda like it, but I like how much the game is broken tbh

[2023-01-09 19:46:49] <aamupala> 3 and new vegas were so much better than 4
[2023-01-09 19:46:50] <$chunkymonkey737> 4 times the size of Fallout 4
[2023-01-09 19:46:50] <!%+AirahsELL> surprisingly 76 got updated to a playable state. i have friends who really like it.
[2023-01-09 19:46:53] <%+shibiririreruwa> 4 has a good gameplay loop but dog poo story
[2023-01-09 19:46:54] <chromasnare> didn't the fix 76 or did I imagine that?

[2023-01-09 19:47:11] <+Abstract_Endurance> yep

[2023-01-09 19:51:05] <@%BlackCharcz> @Abstract_Endurance That's technically true, but it wasn't even numbered. They just rehashed the story continuity so they could sell game bundles
[2023-01-09 19:51:07] <!%+AirahsELL> the white cloak made sense in the first game only.
[2023-01-09 19:51:09] <%Anachroniser> black flag was ok, 2 was a ton better
