[2023-01-08 00:24:23] <!%+Bence9811> so, the lotr movies on prime video are extended ones?
[2023-01-08 00:24:29] <%+matthy2000> gandalf foresight?
[2023-01-08 00:24:38] <%+matthy2000> you have enough points to buy him
[2023-01-08 00:24:40] <Faithfull16> @Bence9811 Seems to be different, depends on the country you're from?
[2023-01-08 00:24:40] <%Malsu65> @bendovermia I think so
[2023-01-08 00:24:46] <%Agnitio3> @Bence9811 there are one with "(extended)" after the title
[2023-01-08 00:24:52] <%Agnitio3> not sure if they are free
[2023-01-08 00:24:53] <!%+Bence9811> @Bence9811 hu

[2023-01-08 22:42:45] <%maxlevelnerd> players also get extra units per turn if they control all cores of a colored terrority.

[2023-01-08 22:46:34] <%Sab3tH> a set of 3 cards gives you a onetime reinforcement bonus
[2023-01-08 22:46:42] <%Charlie_Wagner> if you own the territory u also get a bonus
[2023-01-08 22:46:53] <%+KaasKikkerKoning> i know
[2023-01-08 22:46:57] <%+KaasKikkerKoning> >:)
[2023-01-08 22:47:02] <%Sab3tH> only once per turn i think
[2023-01-08 22:47:14] <d4rthg4mer> I guess the total number of territories is 63 so one player have 15 not 16
[2023-01-08 22:47:48] <%Sab3tH> you dont draw more than one territory card per turn otherwise player one could win in 1 turn
[2023-01-08 22:47:59] VIEWERS: 790

[2023-01-08 22:51:33] <%Sab3tH> to make it faster you can make house rule to be able to allow one dice to represent a larger unit type for example a rider or eagle meaning if you lose the dice roll you also lose 5 units instead of one

[2023-01-08 23:01:54] <%Dwalog> @tommykaylive maybe check the card again, i think its a mission card, so a leader must be in tharbad, just in cause
[2023-01-08 23:01:56] <%c0sma23> or maybe not?
[2023-01-08 23:01:57] <%ThitaloDixito> yes you are supposed to be able to clean the board like that
[2023-01-08 23:01:59] <%+Electroblazer> mfers already gotta go back to the rules
[2023-01-08 23:01:59] <d4rthg4mer> you can attack
[2023-01-08 23:02:01] <randomhungarian7> GIGACHAD clears board 1 turn
[2023-01-08 23:02:02] <%maxlevelnerd> your allowed to attack from conquer terroity and literally blitz the board
[2023-01-08 23:02:02] <veteraniu> Can't you do that in Risk tho
[2023-01-08 23:02:06] VIEWERS: 761
[2023-01-08 23:02:08] <+VioletSAAB> he can do wahtever he wants, its basic RISK
[2023-01-08 23:02:08] <%Mannrik> you can clean the board in 1 turn in risk
[2023-01-08 23:02:10] <+TheDrado> you can always attack from all conquered territories too
[2023-01-08 23:02:19] <%+boohoo222> That's RISK guys lol
[2023-01-08 23:02:20] <%Charlie_Wagner> you can attack forever
[2023-01-08 23:02:22] <%ThitaloDixito> yes if u r lucky and strong enough
[2023-01-08 23:02:23] <%+TVLGOS> did he attack with alll those units or did he fortify with them
[2023-01-08 23:02:29] <+TheDrado> this is basic RISK :D
[2023-01-08 23:02:32] <clocklock90> blitzkrieg
[2023-01-08 23:02:36] <%Sab3tH> you dont have enough units to conquer the board
[2023-01-08 23:02:39] <%+boohoo222> No, you can push as many as you want
[2023-01-08 23:02:39] <%ThitaloDixito> exactly tommy
[2023-01-08 23:02:47] <%Malsu65> yes
[2023-01-08 23:02:47] <%OddBallGamer33> What a RISK that would be. Ha. haha. hahaha Kappa
[2023-01-08 23:03:01] <%c0sma23> get it
[2023-01-08 23:03:01] <%Mannrik> going 1 attack per turn makes the game WAY too long
[2023-01-08 23:03:02] <randomhungarian7> 1 madlad of moria
[2023-01-08 23:03:03] <%c0sma23> RISK
[2023-01-08 23:03:03] <+TheDrado> 1. you can invade from same territory again, and he can attack from Fangorn that he just conquered

[2023-01-08 23:03:41] <%KarolJanNowak> well, you can  blitz but blitz too much and you get winter of 1941 as th result basically
[2023-01-08 23:03:55] <%ThitaloDixito> facts
[2023-01-08 23:04:08] <%Slippy313> you have to leave defenders behind so eventually you will run out of steam too

[2023-01-08 23:08:43] <+TheDrado> if I understood the rules correct
[2023-01-08 23:08:54] <%malinous147> what happens again when u control an entire colour continent

[2023-01-08 23:09:02] <%Malsu65> @malinous147 you get extra troops
[2023-01-08 23:09:02] <+TheDrado> Don't you always have to roll 3 or higher for the fellowship to move?
[2023-01-08 23:09:04] <%Dwalog> @tommykaylive maybe check the tharbad card again, i think its a mission card, so a leader must be in tharbad, just in cause

[2023-01-08 23:10:39] <%+thomas_letrain> Yes it says you need a leader to complete a mission
[2023-01-08 23:10:51] <%Dwalog> Its in the rules but you can ignore that, makes it easier
[2023-01-08 23:10:54] <%+Crome18> Tommy didnt you have to roll a dice for the fellowship to move?
[2023-01-08 23:11:25] <LegatusLanista> The black places like Erebor are for those exact missions, the leader needs to move there
[2023-01-08 23:11:29] <%ThitaloDixito> yes he's losing at least 1 all the time he moves
[2023-01-08 23:11:30] <%c0sma23> oh i see
[2023-01-08 23:11:32] <%gabor_774> adjust the territory numbers
[2023-01-08 23:11:33] <%+Crome18> oh only if a dice is one the map aah I thought the dice icon was for only having to roll a 6
[2023-01-08 23:11:37] <%c0sma23> i was just about to say why he moved there
[2023-01-08 23:11:53] <Judgmentscii> do you follow the rule of Defender advantage, meaning that if the defender rolls 5 the attacker has to roll 6 else (the attacker) losses?
[2023-01-08 23:12:06] <%Sab3tH> the rule with the leader having to be on the location of power is important since adventures are designed with that in mind

[2023-01-08 23:30:49] <%Sab3tH> in normal risk you can move as many as you like except 1 which has to stay behind and moving with a minimum of how many dice you used
[2023-01-08 23:30:49] <biomarco1979> @KarolJanNowak Not really in the rule they use "Connected territories" and not "Adjacent territories" but to be honest I've played with both rule and both work. Island hoping like you commented make the game a little to slow
