[2023-01-09 13:22:54] <$V1perN3st> USPS might be the cheapest, but sucks.
[2023-01-09 13:23:13] <!%phong1911> a thing I find with international shipping is they always lost my packages :c I still waiting for my friend Christmas card since 2020
[2023-01-09 13:23:33] <%+rikirinka> yeah usps usually is gonna be the lowest price in terms of just mailing, but people in the same country could do a group order to save shipping cost
[2023-01-09 13:24:03] <$V1perN3st> I have had a lot of issues with USPS including lost packages, ignoring hold mail request, etc...
[2023-01-09 13:24:15] <!%raneBlu> shipping is kinda a gamble a lot of the time
[2023-01-09 13:24:16] <$V1perN3st> Besides, USPS will be handing it off to another carrier anyways.

[2023-01-09 13:58:19] <@%JayVtuber> capriiiSleepy in a lot of mythos feminine and masculine are basic opposites but that doesnt mean man vs woman...the greeks practically invented the femboy and had a similar dichotomy
[2023-01-09 13:58:22] <%GrandGobboBarb> mythological phong
[2023-01-09 13:58:31] <@%JayVtuber> its been a tad over simplified over time
[2023-01-09 13:58:34] <%Honly> we can have a little bit of evil, as a treat
