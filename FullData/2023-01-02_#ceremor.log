[2023-01-02 22:46:37] <@%^Nightbot> Lol. I don't really care if it's not a good look. I don't really like ceremor. Or this community. Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.
