[2022-12-22 12:50:37] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2022-12-22 14:32:33] <%+l1qu1d> I found that if you install windows when u have secondary hard drives installed it’s boot sector is screwed uo
[2022-12-22 14:32:35] <%$catfishghilly> Get a PC they say Kappa
[2022-12-22 14:32:36] <carmodyy> Thats why i had nzxt build mine
[2022-12-22 14:32:37] <%NullPhoria_> Ish always sorts it , just takes a bit of Flaying around
[2022-12-22 14:32:38] <weirdoshrine> Get your ish together
[2022-12-22 14:32:39] <8lackleaf> @AmishZed sometime the m.2-slot is shared with one stat slot, so u cannot use both at same time. try to check that out
[2022-12-22 14:32:47] <%+ugly_79> @amishzed start in safe mode then try and restore previous
[2022-12-22 14:32:54] <%+l1qu1d> I usually disable or remove any hard drives before installing going forward
[2022-12-22 14:32:56] <genebands> @amishzed I thought it was very early for a Guinness, but I wasn't judging after listening to you yesterday Kappa
[2022-12-22 14:32:57] <matty2jayz> yes turd day
[2022-12-22 14:33:01] <PimpStar> @AmishZed @AmishZed check the boot order from bios/efi... somehow the new M2 has take over as primary boot device and you have to bring back the old disk as primary
[2022-12-22 14:33:02] <!%AmishZed> @vargassy into a new m.2 slot? right now it's in the same slot it was before and I removed the new SSD that I was trying to install so there isn't anything new in the PC right now
[2022-12-22 14:33:04] <8lackleaf> * "sata-slot"
[2022-12-22 14:33:05] <H1TMAN973> @FatToni34 uhm... i turn it off? idk how else to answer that lol
[2022-12-22 14:33:07] <+ya829375502> would not trust twitch chat for tech advice imo
[2022-12-22 14:33:12] <%+EGroen90> where is Nate when you need him xD
[2022-12-22 14:33:33] <@%XMugshotX> @AmishZed vargassy: i moved an m.2 drive into another machine did exactly that ... re plugged it back in and it bypassed the repair and miraculously worked
[2022-12-22 14:33:36] <%+newman_777> @amishzed  I'd deffo recommended getting into bios then forcing the boot to the original drive with your OS on. it sounds like it's most likely a bios setting you need to change
[2022-12-22 14:33:36] <%NullPhoria_> i think its like paul said , @AmishZed , Bios is trying to boot from m2 , id look it over if you can get in bios
[2022-12-22 14:33:39] <%+Mr_Danktastic> @AmishZed is something within the BIOS, boot order or something like that
[2022-12-22 14:33:53] <%7rauli> @Bluemoon4u thak u!!!!!
[2022-12-22 14:33:53] <+RICEY69> @amishzed remove GPU and try boot
[2022-12-22 14:33:53] <+LivingRoomTV1> @PimpStar Na, his bios has old drive as the only boot option.
[2022-12-22 14:34:02] <!%AmishZed> it's not boot order guys, only drive shown on boot manager is the old drive with windows on it. I also no longer have the new drive in the PC and it's still doing it
[2022-12-22 14:34:10] <%kim__wild> By any chance is @wasted around? @amishzed
[2022-12-22 14:34:22] <%vargassy> @AmishZed sorry mate into another machine to format.... but when i first plugged it back in i got the repair etc ...removed and replugged and guess i just got luck

[2022-12-22 14:34:28] <%Bluemoon4u> @7rauli your very welcome
[2022-12-22 14:34:29] <saladyn22> @AmishZed check boot type, m.2 uses nvme
[2022-12-22 14:34:31] <+InjunGames> try downloading more ram

[2022-12-22 14:34:58] <%+Thewhiskeyjack> maybe if you kick it real hard twice and use a lot of swear words @amishzed
[2022-12-22 14:35:02] <%+FatToni34> @H1TMAN973 I mean how do you turn on AD Blocker is there something you click on or what
[2022-12-22 14:35:05] <+RICEY69> @amishzed I upgraded pc and fecked my GPU had similar problem
[2022-12-22 14:35:05] <deanobadge> @amishzed have you tried shooting it with a 308 worked for me?
[2022-12-22 14:35:08] <@%^Nightbot> TRMZ releases a new video every week on YT, you can go and see highlights of his adventures here: youtube.com/therunningmanz
[2022-12-22 14:35:17] <%+Ryan493> I think to, windows got triggered into thinking you have a faulty drive. Booting up once with it uninstalled and then trying again might actually work
[2022-12-22 14:35:18] <%NullPhoria_> yea sledge hammers seem to do wonders
[2022-12-22 14:35:20] <8lackleaf> @AmishZed usually i would recommend at that point to show up in "my" store. but it isn't worth to fly to germany for that i guess LUL
[2022-12-22 14:35:23] <!%QuantumAI> This is the "You should stream and ask chat to help" TRMZ was talking about earlier @AmishZed,   Ignore everything random people say here
[2022-12-22 14:35:24] <imcaptaincable> @thewhiskeyjack this is my solution to everything
[2022-12-22 14:35:35] <H1TMAN973> @FatToni34 oh its a browser extension

[2022-12-22 15:14:42] <%aspzan> @xxxsuziexxx by installed do you mean putting it in the motherboard?
[2022-12-22 15:14:51] <sn4pe5> He needs to reinstall windows?
[2022-12-22 15:14:54] <seldawg> He needs to fuel the flux capacitor
[2022-12-22 15:14:55] <$Code_Man_83> I was making a sandwich, but anyone mention checking the Bios to make sure correct drive is selected to boot from?
[2022-12-22 15:14:56] <+Killswitch_DZG> If it's not your primary drive and you have Windows on a seperate drive you just need to format *not answering*
[2022-12-22 15:14:57] <%+vorian_dexter> @xxxsuziexxx not sure that's true.. I've done that. Problem is that it will be formatted as a boot drive. which is something windows gets confused at these days.

[2022-12-22 15:15:12] <%+skiddy4600> Only thing I'd recommend for Ish is to check the boot order in his bios and make sure it's detecting the right boot drive
[2022-12-22 15:15:13] <FuzzyLongcat> I had issues with a new m.2 a few months ago, a bios update fixed it but it was a ball ache trying a million things
[2022-12-22 15:15:14] <%+joshharris2108> his issue is probably in the bios, because the motherboard will have detected the new drive and will try abd boot off it, he just needs to manually wet6the boot drive back to his windows drive, b7tbyes not here to see it

[2022-12-22 16:57:57] <%$Yoddha87> Jameson is a fantastic "cheaper" whiskey.  Not high class or fancy - but still tastes good.  BUT.. I don't mix soda in any of my alcohol so I'm biased
[2022-12-22 16:57:57] <%daley01262> try the Ben Bracken Highland Single Malt ffrom Lidl for a cheap Single Malt, suprisingly good for £16.99 everyday supping.

[2022-12-22 16:58:05] <GraveyardGhul> gatekeeping is keeping someone away from liking thing you like
[2022-12-22 16:58:12] <%QuagaarZ> Gatekeeping is Gordon Ramsay getting hysterical when one of his customers paying 60quid for a ribeye steak asks for some ketchup
[2022-12-22 16:58:14] <%+EXEO_creates> You ever tried Proper 12?
[2022-12-22 16:58:21] <%+vorian_dexter> @therunningmanz the clydeside distillery is starting to produce some really nice whisky that has the profiles that you usually talk about. Great new distillery and not too pricey.

[2022-12-22 16:58:40] <%DefoAnoob> Paul im sure gatekeeping is just trying to keep new people out of something...
[2022-12-22 16:58:43] <%aspzan> I thought it's mroe to do with setting certain rules to follow to be a true fan of something etc
[2022-12-22 16:58:45] <zigmana> do you buy bunnahabhain 18 yourself?

[2022-12-22 18:05:44] <%aspzan> I quit smoking with allen carr's book although the contradiction is it took me two tries. Technically more tries if you count before reading the book
[2022-12-22 18:05:46] <@%PsyFreaker> @gringo_smoker i used to get creative like that. but nothing beats just a normal rolled joint tbh. tulips are mostly a waste of weed if anything

[2022-12-22 18:05:53] <%BoomThtJstHppnd> I smoked for 15 year and quit about 10 years or so ago
[2022-12-22 18:05:53] <%+GEOster1> my dad has been smoking 15+ a day for 57 years. But he's given up, currently 30 days "clean" - so proud of him! He has a bit of COPD, but all in all, he's not bad considering.
[2022-12-22 18:05:55] <vCazsa> Just dont smoke if you can tbh

[2022-12-22 18:06:10] <+superketchup_> My mate's dad could roll a joint with one hand by rolling it on his leg
[2022-12-22 18:06:11] <%+alcyone92> I smoked when I was younger. I look back now and it just seems so gross. But on extremely stressful days I still get the itch for one.

[2022-12-22 18:06:59] <%+ellex101> the thing with quitting  smoking you first have to understand youre more addicted to the rituals than the nicotine itself

[2022-12-22 18:08:07] <%RSA_Bren> Giving up smoking is easy. It's all in the mindset. You have to make yourself believe that it is disgusting and smells/tastes bad etc and you will stop wanting to smoke. That's how I gave up.

[2022-12-22 18:32:23] <MesmerizedBlue> i loved the alert sound ;-)
[2022-12-22 18:32:23] <napa_jonathan> @paulajayne yea i saw the nightbot but it spoke directly about his tower. Was more curious about the monitor. I’m in the market for a new one.
[2022-12-22 18:32:25] <$Fulleazy> im getting a weird feeling someone is close
[2022-12-22 18:32:39] <DecoratedShamus> I thought , I read somewherre he got "infected" recently also ! even, if it doesn't get "finished" its damn good in its current state !
[2022-12-22 18:32:39] <JayK3K> @Furioso90 would be an easy fix, almost seems intentional that its there

[2022-12-22 18:33:03] <%jollygreengregg> maybe it was just emotional for him
[2022-12-22 18:33:04] <%+JetBros> the alert needs to be "love you" (without the bye)
[2022-12-22 18:33:05] <%$conor_dangles> Is it weird that I miss the charity donation sound
[2022-12-22 18:33:07] <%+two_teezy> @montony I will say the ads that play right when you click on someone channel is a bit annoying.  I mean sometimes I want to check it out for a bit and the first thing I have to watch is a few ads.

[2022-12-22 19:47:25] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2022-12-22 20:46:09] <+llpancholl> being in the stream, and getting banned from the server is not entirely accurate. I watched your stream, on a saturday morning, decided I wanted to play some deere isle, and then logged onto a DI server on the other side of the frigging map from where you were, and was banned for stream stalking. I was not in the stream at the same time, there was probably 15 or 20 minutes between when I was banned and when I had closed the twitch stream. So whatever system you use, there are limitations.

[2022-12-22 20:53:22] <+llpancholl> @Unclefood This is exactly what I am saying... I said there is a flaw in the system. I dont use an app, I was in chrome, I closed the tab, but not sure if I closed the entire app. I logged onto a Deer Isle server just a few minutes later, was in the server for about 15 or 20 minutes, and then got banned for 7 days. I told the admins I wasnt in at the same time, they believed different, but the fact is, I wasnt. So as I said, it is an imperfect system.

[2022-12-22 21:36:09] <%SGT_ToxiiCZz> I dont feel as immersed when I see the streamers bonce on screen

[2022-12-22 21:36:10] <%HogzMeat> Exactly: why are you using a camera?….oh look at me
[2022-12-22 21:36:11] <%$izikielrage> We all wonder why LAX uses a camera. laxhawLUL @TheRunningManZ
[2022-12-22 21:36:12] <Kai_de_Hond> I've got a radio face... that's why i don't use a cam ;)
[2022-12-22 21:36:12] <Luketich> Sequisha!
[2022-12-22 21:36:13] <chronic316801> how long you been streaming on Twitch Paul
[2022-12-22 21:36:14] <nunomiguel_1> in most games I watch they do have a cam, I always assumed it was a dayz thing

[2022-12-22 21:36:19] <suto95> someone like xqc gets alot of value from his camera and it adds to the stream, someone like paul, the camera wouldn't add any value or entertainment imo
[2022-12-22 21:36:21] <wilfuleel> paul has an 8k cam but only brings it out for special occasions
[2022-12-22 21:36:25] <rustyjamess> I think its more emersive without a camera its like you are the character
[2022-12-22 21:36:28] <Stryker8812> ish should turn his off hes ugly Kappa

[2022-12-22 21:36:32] <Huwajux> No cam helps with immersion for a game like DayZ too
[2022-12-22 21:36:32] <brorival> i like no cam

[2022-12-22 21:36:38] <%+CrowdCtrlAlt> Ish has that down, no camera during gaming, then camera chatty
[2022-12-22 21:36:42] <%$Dr_Buzzkill_MD> You have to wear pants with a camera
[2022-12-22 21:36:43] <@%Unclefood> Also @TheRunningManZ doesn't use a camera because he doesn't want Logitech badgering him for a sponsorship

[2022-12-22 21:36:47] <Fozzie_420> The only reason Lax uses a cam is because when he goes into one of those laughing fits that looks like he's gonna die, life insurance has evidence

[2022-12-22 21:36:53] <suto95> Ish uses his cam while just speaking to chat, but when playing, doesnt use it, i think he does it well
[2022-12-22 21:36:54] <%+C4ttyw4mpus> well personally I could care less about a camera ... when I watch on my TV it looks better

[2022-12-22 21:36:57] <%+galasteve> Aandyh too.   I personally prefer without.   Lax is the only one I feel where it actually adds to the stream.

[2022-12-22 21:38:22] <OneEyedRyan> @therunningmanz NBC spawns are either changed or broken. power plant doesn't spawn any, so I found all there at that place where you are
[2022-12-22 21:38:22] <%bearfnf> I'd rather not have my delusions of what you look like ruined by a face camera

[2022-12-22 21:38:34] <%+movemaker_> I feel like it's weird to have a cam when playing any game. It takes away from the game. That's my preference obviously
[2022-12-22 21:38:35] <@%+Redline_Si> Rectum uses a camera now
[2022-12-22 21:38:35] <+shinb0ne_> HollyRex uses it well.
[2022-12-22 21:38:35] <%gnoah> TMRZ is going to start doing no cam hottub streams
[2022-12-22 21:38:37] <%+hattyb89> but you do have a face cam
[2022-12-22 21:38:38] <$dntblametay1989> Some streamers even have filters on their webcam that turns them into fruits or veg
[2022-12-22 21:38:38] <J_Dudee> I'm here to watch gameplay, not someone's face.
[2022-12-22 21:38:44] <ArneTheNord> @crowdctrlalt maybe. but for me it takes focus away from the game.

[2022-12-22 21:39:15] <%+galasteve> I have about 20 DayZ streamers that I follow that are playing right now.   Only ONE has a facecam on.  And it’s a lady.  For whom I think facecams are an obvious plus for getting views.

[2022-12-22 21:39:43] <brorival> I think that it thepens on the game, DayZ does not need emotions from the cam, its thents enough

[2022-12-22 22:23:55] <%+toppa35> @HogzMeat Nightbot is a chat bot for Twitch, YouTube, and Trovo that allows you to automate your live stream's chat with moderation and new features, allowing you to spend more time entertaining your viewers.
[2022-12-22 22:23:56] <%K0D3R_> @HogzMeat same nightbot, and it's a chat bot to help mods / streamers.

[2022-12-22 22:24:15] <%codex_ashton> @CrowdCtrlAlt its funny and kinda shitty, but as an american here the italian food really doesnt taste that great. im guessing its because im used to american pasta and pizza that is loaded full of salt and cheese and loads of other unhealthy shit to make it taste "good", whereas here all that stuff is cooked a lot healthier without all the additives. since im used to the american stuff it all seems pretty bland. im sure over time my pallet will adjust to enjoy the simplicity of real food lol

[2022-12-22 22:44:53] <%$bobfromthebell> I think the meat going off so quickly might be to do with the ambient temperature
[2022-12-22 22:44:54] <TheCaptainJupiterShow> yum
