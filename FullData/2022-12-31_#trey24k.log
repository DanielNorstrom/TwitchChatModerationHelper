[2022-12-31 05:22:46] <Attica1971> So they don’t fall out. Not walking through a paper range. Sometime you gotta run, jump, hit the ground quickly. Just different styles of shooting man. I’m sure not covering mags definitely make it faster when you’re competition shooting.

[2022-12-31 23:55:33] <+JNips15> You can run into cheats and just not know they are cheating 70% of the time
[2022-12-31 23:55:43] <+fine_nut> nah fr fr, or at least blatant enough for me to care to notice
[2022-12-31 23:55:45] <%+StrangerFPS_> TREN ran into i think 4 in a row yesterday lol
[2022-12-31 23:55:45] <%Slayforpay> no hes not, hes telling me cheaters dont exist
[2022-12-31 23:55:47] <+KenoAhnung> maybe he is the luckiest guy oon earth and wasted his luck on tarkov instead on gambling LUL
[2022-12-31 23:55:53] <Zumwar> least he didn't get a face tap
[2022-12-31 23:55:57] <+BelmTV> @trey24k how many cheaters this wipe so far?

[2022-12-31 23:56:05] <%+midgeteer0> Trey I gotta be honest dude I haven’t ran into a cheater myself in months. The last raid I did was months ago but that’s irrelevant
[2022-12-31 23:56:07] <Prisoner141> @fine_nut stop the cap
[2022-12-31 23:56:10] <nicksquadz> im too shit at this game to tell if someones cheating

[2022-12-31 23:56:23] <+etwenn> @JNips15 but the reverse is also true, you can run into what you think is a cheater but really just got lucky

[2022-12-31 23:56:40] <josteintv> blatant cheaters is one thing. the worst are the ones hiding it, soft hacking like total skitzos
[2022-12-31 23:56:40] <reknnnnnn> can u even keep track of days rn?
[2022-12-31 23:56:40] <%+promnitetv> i think it just depends on how much you play, like if you put in 4 hours a every few days you prob wont notice much
[2022-12-31 23:56:42] <%+Governmentmu1e> Last wipe ran into 6 cheaters in a row on Customs
