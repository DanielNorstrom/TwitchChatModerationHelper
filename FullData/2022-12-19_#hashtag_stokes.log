[2022-12-19 10:57:32] <%xylexxy> emi martinez MY GOAT
[2022-12-19 10:57:35] <+avenge_mb> It was a big miss but the save was incredible
[2022-12-19 10:57:36] <%Dzoney_> kolo muani came on and did very well apart from that chance
[2022-12-19 10:57:38] <ERamirex03> Stokes you looking young today
[2022-12-19 10:57:45] <!%Jack_B> lets be honest it was a freak save, that goes in 90% of the time, he was just unlucky
[2022-12-19 10:57:49] <%+foppe420> Emi martinez is the funniest footballer i‚Äôve seen
[2022-12-19 10:57:50] <%leedevitt> Its an unbelievable save
[2022-12-19 10:57:52] <%NelzBah> It was more of a fantastic save rather than a bad miss
[2022-12-19 10:57:58] <%Dzoney_> he got the pen and scored his pen
[2022-12-19 10:57:59] <silentsword22194> What did u pack from icon?
[2022-12-19 10:58:02] <%+connorscp95> did you see that a few Argentina players were on the pitch when there 3rd goal went in üëÄüëÄ
[2022-12-19 10:58:02] <%+palachu_04> in my opinion Camavinga and Coman changed the game

[2022-12-19 11:00:13] <%+connorscp95> martinez won Argentina that with his mind games chucking the ball away ect
[2022-12-19 11:00:13] <%+palachu_04> I think the problems go beyond the country and how FIFA does not speak out, like for example this Iranian player that it's about to be killed/executed and FIFA is not speaking out
[2022-12-19 11:00:15] <trippyerror> actually if you pack r9 wouldn't that be nice
[2022-12-19 11:00:15] <MobbleYobble> gold mbappe or wc voller?

[2022-12-19 11:40:47] <%zmlkc> geezas ego needs no assistance
[2022-12-19 11:40:48] <+FJKotze> Is Perisic better than Jude tho?
[2022-12-19 11:40:52] <LosBIancos> Theo was so bad yesterday it was unbelievable
[2022-12-19 11:40:56] <poals2024> it was tiring yesterday but in hindsight winning it on pens made it so much better
[2022-12-19 11:41:02] <tempurez> The French can‚Äôt be unhappy tho because he‚Äôs 23 and will win more wcs anyway
[2022-12-19 11:41:04] <+ajetovic> Probably the best wc final ever and im happy for messi that he finally got his world cup. With that said mbappe should of gotten player of the tournament
[2022-12-19 11:41:18] <%cj_nsza> i am discarding every argentina player i get from now
[2022-12-19 11:41:19] <%Petrodoggz> @hashtag_stokes can you use di Maria on 1 chem see if he is still good? interested to see the change when not on full chem

[2022-12-19 11:41:53] <%+nicorocq> Messi deserved player of the tournament
[2022-12-19 11:41:56] <lucas33305> Mbappe and Messi so much above everyone else
[2022-12-19 11:41:56] <!%+acluvsufan> Mbappe was off it vs England and Morocco
[2022-12-19 11:41:58] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> messi got an 8.1 sofascore for missing a pen against poland btw
[2022-12-19 11:42:08] <%+griff10_> He deserves it, he got motm every knockout game
[2022-12-19 11:42:13] <GodParticale> Kurt stream was LIT üî• yesterday hahahaha so funny
[2022-12-19 11:42:14] <rondom_> He got marked out the final until the 80th
[2022-12-19 11:42:17] <josh_hazza> whats that perisic like?
[2022-12-19 11:42:25] <+JB4yliss> Anyone used Griez? Any good?
[2022-12-19 11:42:29] <Creepy__23> Kurt reaction to Tchouameni penalty miss killed me
[2022-12-19 11:42:30] <rondom_> If they didn‚Äôt get that pen he wouldn‚Äôt even be in contention

[2022-12-19 11:42:37] <teecbee_> When I saw Kurt celebrating throwing a stuffed et toy in the air, I realised I‚Äôm far too normal to be in a Kurt stream
[2022-12-19 11:42:41] <+ajetovic> @lucas33305 exactly what stokes said he got marked out of them game and when you dont mark him he does what he did yesterday. Only issue is yesterday the rest of france did not show up
[2022-12-19 11:42:42] <%+palachu_04> the second goal was all Molina's fault, he did not continue with Mbappe

[2022-12-19 11:51:56] <+daniel_lee21> they looked flat off their feet
[2022-12-19 11:52:02] <+frostie33> Do you think nkunku will drop lots?
[2022-12-19 11:52:03] <+saurabh_17> argentina was gassed out last 15 mins

[2022-12-19 11:52:09] <+76ersgoat4> the di maria goal looked too easy
[2022-12-19 11:52:11] <%+palachu_04> I think is Deschamps fault, he needed more people in the midfield
[2022-12-19 11:52:12] <+paresh01> I wished benzema and nkunku was there man and maignan
[2022-12-19 11:52:12] <%+iFearIess> @toxicgrllzly Same problem mate 3* skills is awful and he is 5'6

[2022-12-19 11:53:17] <ejswast> Argentina closed down space really well, France had to play in very tight spaces
[2022-12-19 11:53:18] <simsez271010> kounde was gassed coz he was chasing Di Marias shadow
[2022-12-19 11:53:33] <aman4311> Argentina was simply dominant in first 60 min
[2022-12-19 11:53:34] <+76ersgoat4> di maria destroyed kounde

[2022-12-19 11:54:06] <ejswast> Argentina was forcing France to play in very tight spaces which they dont excell at
[2022-12-19 11:54:13] <LosBIancos> Coman so clear
[2022-12-19 11:54:15] <!+craigyestlea> Des champs made incredible changes that is what Southgate lacks big time
[2022-12-19 11:54:16] <hanslfc8> argentinas press was insane, resulted in 2 goals

[2022-12-19 11:54:20] <Wommeh__> it was the isolation and overloading of kounde by Argentina caused france the issues
[2022-12-19 11:54:23] <%jordan_g1888> Newcastle linked with Enzo Fernandez

[2022-12-19 11:55:52] <camzrtg> what about ambarat
[2022-12-19 11:56:05] <%+jammymctavish> otamendi giving away that pen was sloppy
[2022-12-19 11:56:11] <lucas33305> If just Mbappe got that chance it would be historical
[2022-12-19 11:56:12] <aimtek_1337> @iFearIess its crazy that Xavi wants to build winning team around him KEKW
[2022-12-19 11:56:18] <%rygn922> lol even vvd and ney are fodders now lol
[2022-12-19 11:56:18] <+Dennis7NL> Tchou and Cama
[2022-12-19 11:56:19] <+mofeba> Amrabat was the best midfielder and he‚Äôs only 26. Expect to see offers flying in
[2022-12-19 11:56:24] <%jamzy212> Morocco biggest passioned team, made the tournament üëèüèΩ
[2022-12-19 11:56:28] <TBPROXX> That would be a Mario g√∂tze moment if Kolomuani scored
[2022-12-19 11:56:29] <%zmlkc> left 100
[2022-12-19 11:56:30] <%+foppe420> @jammymctavish so unnecessary

[2022-12-19 11:56:35] <bareludde> ambarats tackle on mbappe was insane
[2022-12-19 11:56:40] <maz162> u forgot martial
[2022-12-19 11:56:41] <%+iFearIess> Nkunku
[2022-12-19 11:56:41] <%jordan_g1888> Ousmane Dembele is awful
[2022-12-19 11:56:44] <%jordan_g1888> So over rated
[2022-12-19 11:56:48] <aman4311> Moroccan players going to bigger clubs soon..
[2022-12-19 11:56:54] <imran_rzk> Can we agree that Mbappe is better than Haaland now
[2022-12-19 11:56:59] <ejswast> Dembouz wont recover from this WC
[2022-12-19 11:57:01] <dano_47> it was a cracking hit
[2022-12-19 11:57:10] <bondehi> dembele is either a 2 or a 9
[2022-12-19 11:57:13] <bondehi> nothing in between
[2022-12-19 11:57:18] <rondom_> Dembele been the best rw until this wc
[2022-12-19 11:57:19] <+FJKotze> just inconsistent
[2022-12-19 11:57:20] <%jordan_g1888> I think he‚Äôs still got an attitude problem tbf
[2022-12-19 11:57:23] <+paresh01> I wished benzema and maignan was there bro
[2022-12-19 11:57:24] <jamaicankoalabear> Montiel shot was insane unfortunately was blocked tho
[2022-12-19 11:57:25] <lucas33305> Dembele is not consistent enough
[2022-12-19 11:57:29] <+mofeba> He has a lot of talent but is so inconsistent
[2022-12-19 11:57:30] <+sergeantmayo> How‚Äôs di Maria
[2022-12-19 11:57:32] <JxPell> I can't wait for club football to be back
[2022-12-19 11:57:35] <Danielnarus> @imran_rzk who has ever thought Haaland is better than Mbappe???
[2022-12-19 11:57:41] <%rygn922> dembele need to get rid of the mustache
[2022-12-19 11:57:44] <+matthewordish> Have you used di Maria yet lad? Struggling of how to link him in
[2022-12-19 11:57:46] <+kruze009> marchisio or perisic stokes?
[2022-12-19 11:57:49] <+21irst> you guys are judging dembouz on his defensive abilities smh
[2022-12-19 11:57:49] <%Petrodoggz> we will never know what haaland could do
[2022-12-19 11:57:49] <imran_rzk> My point is tho, with how bad France played yesterday, would Haaland have turned up?
[2022-12-19 11:57:51] <+mofeba> Haaland is still my dog in the race
[2022-12-19 11:57:54] <thebestwarzoneplayer8> Is di Maria card good

[2022-12-19 11:58:02] <ale_xxander> Haaland plays for Norway, guys will use world cup
[2022-12-19 11:58:20] <ejswast> @21irst it just so happens that modern football requires attackers to defend more and more
[2022-12-19 11:58:24] <+wilt1c> I packed Mbappe TOTT from rank 4 champs rewards. Reward system‚Äôs in fifa are so random.
[2022-12-19 11:58:25] <+mofeba> @imran_rzk this man was scoring an absurd amount of goals with a Salzburg side in the CL. He his consistent

[2022-12-19 11:59:02] <+hypermonsterz> Haaland born in england
[2022-12-19 11:59:04] <BodyShotI> haaland could have choose england
[2022-12-19 11:59:04] <%rygn922> you reckon mbappe will drop more coming week?
[2022-12-19 11:59:06] <kermsx> haaland born in eng looool
[2022-12-19 11:59:06] <+Jaktrobot> Haaland kan play for England
[2022-12-19 11:59:09] <+Jaktrobot> can
[2022-12-19 11:59:10] <+mofeba> If haaland had a good team tbh he‚Äôd be breaking goal scoring records

[2022-12-19 11:59:26] <%Petrodoggz> to be fair we now have one accomplishment the other doesn't have
[2022-12-19 11:59:30] <imran_rzk> CR7 congratulating Messi would break the internet
[2022-12-19 11:59:31] <%zmlkc> ngl i started believing messi was winning it after the groups, geeza looked so fired up every game
[2022-12-19 11:59:33] <+mofeba> Also trust the Norwegian team is getting better so they might qualify for the next WC
[2022-12-19 11:59:34] <+y3ckzz> I packed fodden team of the tourny I feel like if the card had 5 star skills would be nuts @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-19 11:59:38] <!%Jack_B> honestly Messi is the goat but people are so quick to forget how godly CR7 was for over 10 years

[2022-12-19 11:59:50] <lucas33305> Im not taking anything away from Argentina but referees had shocking pens given to them
[2022-12-19 11:59:52] <chainzro> what do you mean by "we" ? @Petrodoggz

[2022-12-19 12:00:52] <%Petrodoggz> Haaland drags soo much attention  its scary

[2022-12-19 12:01:32] <+itsme_curse> Kante. Nkunku, etc.
[2022-12-19 12:01:36] <Danielnarus> Im happy for Messi and he deserved the win obviously but dont u guys think the run was a little scripted with all those dodgy pens?

[2022-12-19 12:02:19] <+FJKotze> Would you say Perisic is better or same level as Jude?

[2022-12-19 12:02:30] <simsez271010> Di Maria turned back the years yesterday reminded me of CL final performance for Madrid
[2022-12-19 12:02:30] <+MrNumbz> but dispite the final giroud was brilliant all tournament

[2022-12-19 12:02:43] <%+Atartico> i think the reffing was perfect

[2022-12-19 12:03:09] <+Dennis7NL> @hashtag_stokes Use a Portugal coach man, for chem on CR7 he is on 2
[2022-12-19 12:03:13] <+avenge_mb> Messi should have atleast a yellow
[2022-12-19 12:03:14] <%+followthesponge> i thought the reffing was fine apart from first pen
[2022-12-19 12:03:14] <%st_dani1712> Tomori worth it? to have Di Maria on 3 stars I can link with Lucio, Tomori and Theo
[2022-12-19 12:03:20] <lucas33305> Protecting Messi thats it
[2022-12-19 12:03:20] <+Fl0r1sh> yeah, few bad calls but other than that he was really good
[2022-12-19 12:03:20] <+mofeba> It‚Äôs not that the reffing was bad. The game in general rewards soft fouls more now. Let‚Äôs not act like the pens weren‚Äôt the same across the board
[2022-12-19 12:03:20] <ilickroads> I thought that was the best reffed game in the tournament
[2022-12-19 12:03:23] <imran_rzk> @blackzoltanenjoyer don't think so, only 4 days left and apparently WW swaps is starting
[2022-12-19 12:03:23] <+Fl0r1sh> if you compare to other games
[2022-12-19 12:03:23] <LosBIancos> France had a crazy counter in the 90 but he didn't give the advantage
[2022-12-19 12:03:24] <siaboss516> It‚Äôs Messi bro
[2022-12-19 12:03:24] <CameronMcwilliam1> Head injury for the Theo one
[2022-12-19 12:03:24] <%leedevitt> Thought he was decent
[2022-12-19 12:03:25] <UtdFilipp> Won a header with his arms open
[2022-12-19 12:03:27] <trippyerror> ref is a messi fan
[2022-12-19 12:03:28] <+thenorwegiandrogba> guys is salty because he didnt do Correa
[2022-12-19 12:03:28] <ejswast> @hashtag_stokes because it was a ridiculous handball from a France defender before Mbappe got the ball
[2022-12-19 12:03:33] <Danielnarus> Probably yeah, just kinda sus u know. but i agree this tourney had us witnessing the worst refeering of all time ?
[2022-12-19 12:03:35] <aman4311> Refreeing was below par who tournament imo
[2022-12-19 12:03:36] <%+Atartico> it was fair from both sides and was a perfect game
[2022-12-19 12:03:40] <poals2024> the final was among the best reffed games
[2022-12-19 12:03:44] <+jimmy__southpaw> Think that Ivan would be good as an LB on balanced?
[2022-12-19 12:03:47] <+AnonymousInFUT> In whole WC - Yes, but this ref was the best tbh
[2022-12-19 12:03:58] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Nah, ref was amazing.
[2022-12-19 12:04:01] <aimtek_1337> @ejswast false btw
[2022-12-19 12:04:01] <nicco1> It was soft but it was a pen
[2022-12-19 12:04:05] <+ajhicks92> ref was good i thought
[2022-12-19 12:04:05] <+jimmy__southpaw> Even the french players didnt complain about that pen too much
[2022-12-19 12:04:09] <ejswast> @aimtek_1337 true btw
[2022-12-19 12:04:09] <%leedevitt> Defo a pen
[2022-12-19 12:04:11] <$bronxbombr13> agreed
[2022-12-19 12:04:15] <dano_47> To take out a yellow for simulation is a very mature decision
[2022-12-19 12:04:16] <+saurabh_17> imagine if the 3-3 pen was given to argentina instead, people would have gone mad about "scripting"
[2022-12-19 12:04:16] <adibofus> ref gave 2 pens to france too
[2022-12-19 12:04:18] <TwiStaBlisTa> we need rugby refs in football
[2022-12-19 12:04:22] <+thenorwegiandrogba> This is what bias does to you. Ref was good. Are you drunk?
[2022-12-19 12:04:22] <@%+ryelfc> have to protect goats
[2022-12-19 12:04:23] <+Dennis7NL> @hashtag_stokes Use a Portugal coach man, for chem on CR7 he is on 2
[2022-12-19 12:04:26] <+putyz1> did you see the Upamecano handball? before the 3th France goal? and why the VAR don't check these
[2022-12-19 12:04:27] <%rygn922> bro said a fan
[2022-12-19 12:04:29] <%+silversainttv> messi was gifter the cup by how the ref was on his side every game should of been sent off the game beforee
[2022-12-19 12:04:29] <+MisterSlicer> if that pen shouldnt count than first France pen shouldn't count either
[2022-12-19 12:04:31] <%+iFearIess> Super star calls Stokes you know this
[2022-12-19 12:04:36] <simsez271010> don't know what Romero and Otamendi have to do to get sent of this WC
[2022-12-19 12:04:38] <+Jamesn9> Tbf i would protect the goat if i was the ref
[2022-12-19 12:04:44] <lucas33305> Messi has always been protected a lot
[2022-12-19 12:04:47] <+Fl0r1sh> he is still human at the end of the day
[2022-12-19 12:04:49] <caprihk> ANGEL GOOD?
[2022-12-19 12:04:50] <+mofeba> While o agree that it‚Äôs soft. That‚Äôs how the game‚Äôs been for like a decade now. Most pens aren‚Äôt from hard tackles
[2022-12-19 12:04:51] <drako4pl> i really dont think it was a pen
[2022-12-19 12:04:52] <%ollywilson1999> just packed dalot - 145k - keep or sell?
[2022-12-19 12:04:53] <chainzro> the refs were not on the same level as the players. they were horrendous @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-19 12:04:55] <imran_rzk> Even the handball against holland lool
[2022-12-19 12:04:57] <%leedevitt> Romero challenge on mbappe was shocking in ET
[2022-12-19 12:04:57] <+AnonymousInFUT> You are still saying about one call
[2022-12-19 12:04:58] <+Fl0r1sh> but he didn't give yellows to france team as well
[2022-12-19 12:04:59] <TBPROXX> Did you do Correa showdown
[2022-12-19 12:05:01] <+paresh01> Bro mbappe leave psg bro wtf is he doing there
[2022-12-19 12:05:01] <%+Atartico> i think de paul should have gotten booked ages ago tho
[2022-12-19 12:05:07] <Lawbird_123> Honestly who isn‚Äôt Messi fan
[2022-12-19 12:05:10] <%rygn922> tbh i think everybody is a fan of messi, even the french
[2022-12-19 12:05:13] <poals2024> wasnt it alvarez that grabbed someone?
[2022-12-19 12:05:13] <TwiStaBlisTa> we need rugby refs in football, they dont take any shit
[2022-12-19 12:05:16] <%light_hut> Wait, Pavard got the CB position now?
[2022-12-19 12:05:17] <dano_47> Wasnt messi`s foul played advantage (French didnt care)
[2022-12-19 12:05:19] <%light_hut> whoa
[2022-12-19 12:05:21] <%jordan_g1888> Did you see the drone shot in Buenos Aires mate?
[2022-12-19 12:05:28] <CameronMcwilliam1> Dembele also tripped him
[2022-12-19 12:05:32] <simsez271010> have u tried Gomez Ptg yet?
[2022-12-19 12:05:32] <%+iFearIess> Alvarez never stopped running damn
[2022-12-19 12:05:34] <+Fl0r1sh> rabiot could have gone to the showers early for that disguinsting foul as well
[2022-12-19 12:05:41] <+Jamesn9> Great game though and even better ending
[2022-12-19 12:05:44] <ejswast> its crazy that the VAR didnt even look at the handball from France before the 2nd pen for France....massive mistake
[2022-12-19 12:05:46] <Snapboy10> Heystokes happy with the game?  one of the best finals in history i think maybe the best
[2022-12-19 12:05:51] <+itsme_curse> @light_hut he had it since he came out
[2022-12-19 12:05:52] <%+Atartico> hes messi's bodyguard
[2022-12-19 12:05:55] <+mofeba> The issue is the refs are following the book to the T  these days it used to be up to their discretion before. That was a textbook pen but it‚Äôs pretty soft
[2022-12-19 12:05:57] <+paresh01> Bro mbappe leave psg bro wtf is he doing there
[2022-12-19 12:05:57] <azz_177> alvarez made like 8 fouls
[2022-12-19 12:06:00] <imran_rzk> VVD bodied him
[2022-12-19 12:06:03] <Wommeh__> tbf messi didn't get booked multiple times throughout the tournament
[2022-12-19 12:06:03] <@%+ryelfc> they kept snapping de paul
[2022-12-19 12:06:04] <+21irst> you need those shithousery players in your team
[2022-12-19 12:06:05] <cheaky_barstool> WHAT A GAME LADS
[2022-12-19 12:06:07] <%light_hut> @itsme_curse Nah I don't thinks o
[2022-12-19 12:06:09] <%+iFearIess> Paredes Otamendi and De Paul
[2022-12-19 12:06:11] <aimtek_1337> @ejswast wasnt a handball
[2022-12-19 12:06:12] <AussieRig> the whole team is messi bodyguard lol
[2022-12-19 12:06:16] <@%+ryelfc> de pauls a wind up
[2022-12-19 12:06:19] <imran_rzk> I think he wants a UCL medal first
[2022-12-19 12:06:21] <+manlikehilly> Mbappe wants to win the CL first
[2022-12-19 12:06:21] <%leedevitt> @ryelfc so deserved
[2022-12-19 12:06:27] <+paresh01> Madrid is destined for him
[2022-12-19 12:06:30] <adibofus> man i wish mbappe was in madrid ngll
[2022-12-19 12:06:30] <ejswast> @aimtek_1337 literally the most obvious handball ive ever seen in my entire life
[2022-12-19 12:06:31] <Markaveli007> Kante going to Barca
[2022-12-19 12:06:31] <+FJKotze> where does he go in the prem? has to be Chelsea aright?
[2022-12-19 12:06:42] <cheaky_barstool> psg in the league is boring
[2022-12-19 12:06:42] <%jordan_g1888> Psg are awful
[2022-12-19 12:06:47] <+manlikehilly> They defend with 8
[2022-12-19 12:06:50] <+paresh01> Psg are crazy attacking
[2022-12-19 12:06:51] <+6Sants> Should i use a hunter or finisher on jairzinho?
[2022-12-19 12:06:52] <y2klew> the problem is they conceed far to many goals
[2022-12-19 12:06:54] <+Jamesn9> Mbappe at madrid and they win every trophy for the next 10 years
[2022-12-19 12:06:56] <lucas33305> None of Mbappe, Messi, Neymar wants to defend
[2022-12-19 12:06:59] <+mofeba> The midfield is extremely mid
[2022-12-19 12:07:05] <+manlikehilly> @jordan_g1888 not awful tho are they lol

[2022-12-19 12:16:30] <+mhad33> Messi took & scored like 5-7 pens this World Cup you‚Äôve got to respect it it‚Äôs so impressive
[2022-12-19 12:16:32] <%+th3antman> Ally Mccoist with the all time classic line "Mbappe is the first player to score a hattrick in the world cup final where all 3 goals were over the line" üòÄüòÄ
[2022-12-19 12:16:34] <adibofus> People say its 2 pens like its easy to score a pen with all the pressure on his back with all the stakes yet he scored them with cold bloood...
[2022-12-19 12:16:34] <cheaky_barstool> he shoudlve saved the fist

[2022-12-19 12:17:23] <adibofus> anyone who tries to descriminate mbappe because he scored pens is dumb af you dont realise the pressure he has on him
[2022-12-19 12:17:24] <ejswast> that Kolo Muani pen was great as well
[2022-12-19 12:17:25] <+Fl0r1sh> that's the shit talking effect, on one side you have emi who is shithousing and putting people nuder pressure and on the other side is lloris who does nothing
[2022-12-19 12:17:25] <%+palachu_04> Martinez said he did not dive right on the first pen or he woud have saved it
[2022-12-19 12:17:26] <JxPell> like kane haha
[2022-12-19 12:17:27] <cheaky_barstool> mbappe has so much power but doesnt even have big legs, where does the power come from?

[2022-12-19 12:21:02] <spooooke1> where his best position
[2022-12-19 12:21:20] <+mofeba> Messi has 7 goals and 10 assists out of 13 games in the ligue one and 4 goals and 4 assists out of 5 CL games. He‚Äôs seriously still at the top level of performance. He‚Äôs still tied for the best player even currently

[2022-12-19 12:21:57] <%ViciouzMoey> I only like watching you compete on stream tbh
[2022-12-19 12:21:59] <%itsRamzilla> Alvarez did all the running. Quality player.
[2022-12-19 12:22:05] <+daniel_lee21> alvarez is a very good player
[2022-12-19 12:22:10] <+whoisglockriverz> Lautaro has the worst decision making ability in football... ever.. always in chances of scoring but never does the right thing
[2022-12-19 12:22:14] <adibofus> will alvarez have a chance in city now
[2022-12-19 12:22:15] <%rygn922> they definiteky nerfed trivila more than they announced
[2022-12-19 12:22:19] <kbreezy8967_> imb cos even tho he didnt win it he damn near dragged everyone across the finish line
[2022-12-19 12:22:20] <+fitim7united> @hashtag_stokes have you played with grizzy?
[2022-12-19 12:22:23] <+mofeba> I mean lukaku is decent at inter too. Maybe it‚Äôs the inter curse
[2022-12-19 12:22:27] <epinator88> Best tactic After Patch ? Stay narrow or wide
[2022-12-19 12:22:36] <adibofus> barca needs a ST they could buy alvarez

[2022-12-19 12:23:08] <%jordan_g1888> 683k according to futbin
[2022-12-19 12:23:10] <kbreezy8967_> @adibofus they have lewa and they are on the market for moukoko
[2022-12-19 12:23:10] <%itsRamzilla> Greezy 680k now,
[2022-12-19 12:23:13] <%+iFearIess> If only Di Maria had RW
[2022-12-19 12:23:20] <%+big_akuma> have you tried 5*5 nkunku?
[2022-12-19 12:23:26] <kbreezy8967_> alvarez price and enzos price probably above 100 mill rn
[2022-12-19 12:23:33] <+daniel_lee21> thats so cheap
[2022-12-19 12:23:33] <%+th3antman> 3-4-3 gets Ribery and Di Maria in same team üòÄ
[2022-12-19 12:23:34] <GB68> amazing card for that price
[2022-12-19 12:23:34] <adibofus> @kbreezy8967_ lewa is good yeah but old they need youth to ensure their future
[2022-12-19 12:23:35] <%+iFearIess> tiktok market
[2022-12-19 12:23:35] <SUMZUH> is there any where you have a video for 41212 2 tactics?
[2022-12-19 12:23:36] <pray4seany> hey chat, can we see the market drop further?
[2022-12-19 12:23:39] <+antonaldo_20> How is nkunku and griez so cheap
[2022-12-19 12:23:43] <!%joshibet06> Wtf 680üôÉ
[2022-12-19 12:23:43] <+fitim7united> yesterday was crazy lol bought grizzy 898 sold 999 bought 725 sold 890 bought again for 725
[2022-12-19 12:23:43] <imran_rzk> Everyone dropping rn, i don't get it
[2022-12-19 12:23:45] <+dyo_01> Griezman is definitely not worth 680k lol
[2022-12-19 12:23:45] <+thegoslow> people panic selling, causing the price to drop
[2022-12-19 12:23:47] <SUMZUH> !youtube
[2022-12-19 12:23:47] <@^Nightbot> https://www.youtube.com/c/TomStokesFIFA
[2022-12-19 12:23:47] <%jordan_g1888> Only upgrade left was 3 new traits, nothing special
[2022-12-19 12:23:50] <+sparks1886> there's no more hype for him to upgrade
[2022-12-19 12:23:53] <ItsYungSherman> @antonaldo_20 hype over
[2022-12-19 12:23:56] <%mdoyle92> that nkunku is like a TOTS card
[2022-12-19 12:23:56] <+daniel_lee21> but they are 5 5
[2022-12-19 12:24:02] <leo_gamerttv> Im new whar are ur opinions on argentina winning the world cup
[2022-12-19 12:24:02] <%mdoyle92> way too OP
[2022-12-19 12:24:06] <fieIdz> @dyo_01 he easily is
[2022-12-19 12:24:07] <%+Harwoodinho> I cant stand the market, thats why I do loads of sbc's and end up with a first owned team
[2022-12-19 12:24:08] <adibofus> alvarez needs to change clubs
[2022-12-19 12:24:11] <+antonaldo_20> @itsyungsherman but still
[2022-12-19 12:24:11] <kbreezy8967_> @adibofus moukoko on a free transfer is a good deal
[2022-12-19 12:24:11] <+AnonymousInFUT> When you take "live value" of the card - the card is dropping hard; the same will happen to Gomez and Romero
[2022-12-19 12:24:13] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> if you've used griez for over 100 games like me you'll know thats his real worth
[2022-12-19 12:24:13] <vegarking> griezman should be around 500k imo
[2022-12-19 12:24:18] <%zTommyHx> griezmann better than mbappe?
[2022-12-19 12:24:22] <+chadanderson_> how much better is ronaldo rb than gold?
[2022-12-19 12:24:22] <%+followthesponge> perisic good on 0?
[2022-12-19 12:24:27] <!%joshibet06> Mid r9 is flat 6m now
[2022-12-19 12:24:28] <kbreezy8967_> alvarez defo getting the start at city now along with haaland no??
[2022-12-19 12:24:30] <+fitim7united> these PTGs are basically early Fut Birthdays
[2022-12-19 12:24:31] <+braveheartsaad> Is he better than cantona? I feel talker strikers are faster
[2022-12-19 12:24:35] <lucas33305> Griezmann can also play RW as we dont have lots of them
[2022-12-19 12:24:42] <IronlakPat> How u like mid Puskas
[2022-12-19 12:24:53] <%zTommyHx> would you pick griezmann over mbappe? @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-19 12:24:53] <+antonaldo_20> Cruyff 91 worth it?
[2022-12-19 12:24:54] <TBPROXX> Correa showdown is cracked
[2022-12-19 12:24:59] <adibofus> @kbreezy8967_ im not familiar with that player but where would alvarez go in your opinion ?
[2022-12-19 12:24:59] <+chadanderson_> how much better is ronaldo rb than gold??
[2022-12-19 12:25:03] <+sparks1886> gomez was 1.4 and extinct before his upgrade now less than a million
[2022-12-19 12:25:07] <xtonybluex> al owairan or griezman?
[2022-12-19 12:25:09] <+Dennis7NL> No one can afford Mbappe lol

[2022-12-19 12:25:34] <+6Sants> Stokes I know you said hunter on jairzinho, but he‚Äôs explosive on finisher only, he still best on controlled?

[2022-12-19 12:44:27] <+dyo_01> Idk how you people get hackers, I've allways played on PC and apart from draft, never saw a hacker
[2022-12-19 12:44:28] <mexicandrug_dealer> @mdoyle92 isnt it much cheaper than a PC? at least mine
[2022-12-19 12:44:30] <+niKKon3> We pc players have cheaters but console players are by far more toxic
[2022-12-19 12:44:34] <TiReRR> how we doing grandpa TriHard

[2022-12-19 12:45:08] <@%+dezperado618> In my PC CHamps this weekend i faced 3 no loss glitchers, 2 AI hackers, and 1 max stats player
[2022-12-19 12:45:10] <ogtunes> don't feel bad guys,  I play from pc with crossplay ON and go 0-10 on WL LUL

[2022-12-19 12:45:18] <%+zGullit> my game pauses, freezeframe - then when it unpauses and for the duration it was paused my controller is disabled, and it speeds up as well

[2022-12-19 12:45:41] <%mdoyle92> @calcium_77 i dont think we are all cheaters but ican see why due to what happens
[2022-12-19 12:45:42] <@%+dezperado618> to force yourself to go into the game as AI you just need to reduce your bandwidth as youre loading in
[2022-12-19 12:45:43] <!%joshibet06> @zgullit üëãüèø
[2022-12-19 12:45:44] <aman4311> There are always some % of people in every group who cheat
[2022-12-19 12:45:51] <%+baitsee> do you know why you cant put world cup icons in an sbc
[2022-12-19 12:45:52] <+Diglx> i play on pc and 0 problems with controllers and lag, but yeah some hackers
[2022-12-19 12:45:57] <+x_Neo11> PC cheats are third party programs not glitches
[2022-12-19 12:46:03] <Alp733> Oh they cheat by using the computer? Or have methods to increase their players speed and get automatic goals?
[2022-12-19 12:46:09] <@%lukesouths48> YES STOKESYY we good?
[2022-12-19 12:46:13] <aman4311> dat true
[2022-12-19 12:46:14] <pennanennn> thats literally a cheat code for a shit player like a free rank 1 every weekend
[2022-12-19 12:46:14] <%+zGullit> the game is sped up, and i press pause at first instance, then like 10-30 seconds later the pause will come up (by this point im 1 or 2-0 down)
[2022-12-19 12:46:19] <+aymuni> Remember the no loss glitch with testing NAT type???
[2022-12-19 12:46:20] <joostgerrits2004> How is di maria

[2022-12-19 12:46:29] <%+th3antman> yeah it's a code
[2022-12-19 12:46:32] <pennanennn> yea i think so
[2022-12-19 12:46:34] <+x_Neo11> They are paying a website for a code
[2022-12-19 12:46:35] <+Diglx> ofc its a different program
[2022-12-19 12:46:35] <+calcium_77> @mdoyle92 it's not just this game though mate it's every game hence why I don't play COD anymore ether it's been RUINED by PC players
[2022-12-19 12:46:39] <%mdoyle92> its like people who auto bot the transfer market
[2022-12-19 12:46:41] <+sparks1886> it's a cheat code
[2022-12-19 12:46:42] <%+FashionRep> it's a program

[2022-12-19 12:46:45] <@%+dezperado618> you dont need to install anything for the AI glitch. But you do for the other cheats
[2022-12-19 12:46:50] <+Lueytg> They lay like ¬£4 a day for their cheats LUL

[2022-12-19 12:47:03] <Alp733> Yeah in StarCraft they had hacks, they‚Äôd load the game using a 3rd party program. And it can have anything

[2022-12-19 12:47:08] <%+th3antman> fifa can't patch it because its not in the fifa code. they need to up their anti cheat software to detect it
[2022-12-19 12:47:10] <+aymuni> ¬£4 a day to get gold donnaruma in champs
[2022-12-19 12:47:10] <Danielnarus> Crossplay was a huge dub coming to FIFA, but including PC is the biggest L
[2022-12-19 12:47:11] <pennanennn> i heard theres like a anti cheat but i heard u can play wwithout it so like whats the point of it
[2022-12-19 12:47:12] <%mdoyle92> its exactly like the people who use bots for the transfer market
[2022-12-19 12:47:21] <%mdoyle92> different software
[2022-12-19 12:47:25] <@%+dezperado618> Anyone on PC can do the AI glitch without installing anything
[2022-12-19 12:47:32] <ttbrst> might remove crossplay
[2022-12-19 12:47:34] <+sparks1886> that's why you can only do it on pc cos you have access to the code
[2022-12-19 12:47:35] <%jordan_g1888> Check milestones for the World Cup tournament mate
[2022-12-19 12:47:38] <%+palachu_04> I do not understand the point to play a game just to cheat
[2022-12-19 12:47:38] <james_london_kensington> If you are talking about cheatarmy, they are scammers; I bought the Fifa licence just to check it and it doesn't work.
[2022-12-19 12:47:44] <bothunter25> if the cheat was free everyone would use . its 3rd party paid cheat engines
[2022-12-19 12:47:46] <ghostsolda7> is ginola better st than mbappe ? @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-19 12:47:47] <+DiverseWins> the reason romero felt slow is height and hes not base lengthy

[2022-12-19 12:47:50] <doodle500> it's basically automated programs which enable the ai when you match them. Weird how they bypassed the security just days after the release.
[2022-12-19 12:47:53] <%+Jtactixx> Have you tried dalot yet ??
[2022-12-19 12:48:10] <+calcium_77> Imagine being that sad you buy cheats üëÄü§£ life must be class for them. bet they've never felt the touch of a woman

[2022-12-19 12:48:28] <%+palachu_04> Romero feels slow because of his pace split, he does not have 95+ acceleration like other CBs
[2022-12-19 12:48:30] <%mdoyle92> @calcium_77 yeah cod sucks hard

[2022-12-19 14:02:06] <%+th3antman> there's no such thing as a soft penalty. a penalty is a penalty.
[2022-12-19 14:02:08] <Thoms185X> Where is the record?
[2022-12-19 14:02:13] <+aymuni> As a chelsea fan. The CL final against city wasn‚Äôt the best

[2022-12-19 14:03:03] <%+mikejew> @th3antman penalties are subjective so theirs definitely such thing as a soft penalty

[2022-12-19 14:07:48] <+aymuni> The old generation talk about players with joy. We are a generation that just talk bad about players like ronaldo after everything he‚Äôs done

[2022-12-19 14:08:21] <akpofure12> Messi is the clear favourite as of now. But players like neymar,haaland and mbappe are in with a shout. Plus we don't know how the rest of the season will shape up
[2022-12-19 14:08:24] <poals2024> nah like 2 months at a stretch
[2022-12-19 14:08:24] <ads_2011> ballondor is so far away still. also the first half of this season was for last years ballondor not this year

[2022-12-19 14:10:24] <!%Jack_B> Griez surprised me this WC, what a player he is playing abit deeper
[2022-12-19 14:10:31] <akpofure12> Psg are deffo beating Bayern. Neuer is injured and will miss both games

[2022-12-19 14:10:56] <+notkrasi> Stokes have you tried normal Walker at cb? So good to track back the through balls
[2022-12-19 14:10:57] <shady0003> what if PSG won the UCL with Mbappe being the top scorer, should he win or Messi?
[2022-12-19 14:10:57] <SarcasticHD1111> @kbreezy8967_ fax, and its not gonna be close
[2022-12-19 14:11:01] <akpofure12> CR7 wasn't stylish when he won the ballond'or in 2018

[2022-12-19 14:11:02] <%addhyany12> you're right tho. this season neymar has been the best
[2022-12-19 14:11:05] <poals2024> either way messi will be the favourite for b'dor cause he already has the wc and any trophy mbappe wins messi will also win
[2022-12-19 14:11:07] <%cj_nsza> @palachu_04 nah ligue 1 is trash bro
[2022-12-19 14:11:10] <@%+dezperado618> @palachu_04 what % of those players played for the same team? L1 is top heavy with no balance

[2022-12-19 14:20:19] <%cj_nsza> @palachu_04 nah bro mbappe was france best player yesterday scoring 3 goals in a world cup finale when your team is down 2-0 is very ice cold
[2022-12-19 14:20:22] <+BigSaph> thanks
[2022-12-19 14:20:27] <%+iamleeegend89> I got him from an icon sbc. he's a bit clunky in game.
[2022-12-19 14:20:27] <liambarn04> What you think I got 91 yashin is he good??
[2022-12-19 14:20:27] <bigmonkeboi> ngl henry should have 99 pace
[2022-12-19 14:20:27] <oiyy12> Criminal though that Henry doesnt have a better card

[2022-12-19 14:20:41] <%+palachu_04> @cj_nsza what did Mbappe do yesterday besides that second goal ? How many times he got past Molina actually ? Argentina controlled him more than well and for me was not even France best player yesterday
[2022-12-19 14:20:46] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> you see that robertson apparently will have 5 SM
[2022-12-19 14:20:47] <%cj_nsza> @palachu_04 3 pens vs best pens keeper tho

[2022-12-19 14:21:12] <akpofure12> Icl Mbappe wasn't that good. I would give him a 6 or 7/10 yesterday

[2022-12-19 14:23:38] <liambarn04> Yashin 91 and van der sars 89 been the most outstanding for me they are both very similar level to me only thing that makes van better is nationality

[2022-12-19 14:24:03] <koyirohyuga> For me ter Stegen is king Courtois is ass (in Pifa)
[2022-12-19 14:24:07] <isimpforzerotwo> di Maria worth?
[2022-12-19 14:24:10] <+BYCakes> I'm the opposite. I expect them all to be equally useless so it doesn't really matter
[2022-12-19 14:24:10] <%+Mcjon101> yh particularly Yashin is a love / hate , i fuckin hate him
[2022-12-19 14:24:12] <greenforestbear89> nice shot cancel
[2022-12-19 14:24:15] <%+palachu_04> @cj_nsza Messi scored 2 and yet Di Maria was Argentina best player while on the field. He made Kounde looked bang average so I do not understand this goal argument. What if Griezzy would have taken both pens ? Would that made him to have a better performance ?
[2022-12-19 14:24:18] <+ruftkut04> correct like dudek alot

[2022-12-19 14:38:31] <alloutofbubblegum27> Is that why there was no FUTMas due to Fifa?
[2022-12-19 14:38:31] <ItsCoryB> 100%! Revenue becomes theirs completely...Hopefully allowing them to create better content/tournaments etc
