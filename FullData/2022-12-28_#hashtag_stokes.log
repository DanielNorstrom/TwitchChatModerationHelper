[2022-12-28 11:59:04] <%Zaetv> There's no reason with our team why we shouldn't be playing like Arsenal or even newcastle
[2022-12-28 11:59:04] <@Jayden4433> Reece James injured again is actually depressing icl

[2022-12-28 11:59:11] <harrythfc1> thing is we played nice football under poch and won nothing
[2022-12-28 11:59:12] <%RadmoreB> I think the problem is, we had mourinho and conte both similar defensive play styles.
[2022-12-28 11:59:13] <+bigboyrunar13> you still playing 4222

[2022-12-28 12:05:16] <harrythfc1> casemiro is totally clear of any cdm in the league bar perhaps rodri. but even then casemiro edges it imo
[2022-12-28 12:05:16] <aziz147652> apart from shooting casemiro is better
[2022-12-28 12:05:18] <%addhyany12> caseimiro clear lol

[2022-12-28 12:41:35] <%Clutchersz> I never save packs for toty, there are so many sbc‚Äôs during toty which give better odds for toty players like specific league sbc

[2022-12-28 13:28:05] <ryanmarsh807> I think the attack will be benz, Messi and mbappe with haaland 4th man. Sadly cr7 is nowhere near
[2022-12-28 13:28:08] <+Enu_Macchie> ignoring 50+ club games over 8 games at a world cup is silly

[2022-12-28 13:34:46] <Ad_aamm> He definitely can't, just because Liverpool won doesn't mean Trent can defend..... He makes so many mistakes, their attack was just so dominant it covered them.
[2022-12-28 13:34:46] <%Swazzzz> Robbo Also has more responsibility defensively

[2022-12-28 13:36:17] <dagmargomes21> trent is OOP always
[2022-12-28 13:36:25] <taggs85> Trent plays very well in Liverpools system, works very well against the weaker teams, but in big games he‚Äôs likely a liability
[2022-12-28 13:36:26] <Strikerr_NW> Trent is there for his defensive aspect truthfully, he‚Äôs an offensive FB
[2022-12-28 13:36:28] <dagmargomes21> man's a cm for god sake
[2022-12-28 13:36:28] <%+punyay> Trent can't play midfield he needs the time and space he is allowed by being at Rb
[2022-12-28 13:36:28] <huss_fiaze1> Nah Trent‚Äôs great at defending
[2022-12-28 13:36:42] <+sceinz> Yes stokesssss

[2022-12-28 13:42:02] <dagmargomes21> and the british media and british football association praises him

[2022-12-28 13:42:04] <@%+georgesquirrell> I‚Äôm glad I got the Madrid fans off my neck saying Benzema is in top 15 all time strikers
[2022-12-28 13:42:16] <dagmargomes21> @surkkkk yes but as RIGHT DEFENDER , you need to DEFEND
[2022-12-28 13:42:20] <+sceinz> @bailey_mck01 that makes no sense then
[2022-12-28 13:42:22] <dagmargomes21> if you can't defend why you are there

[2022-12-28 13:42:55] <chewablealarm> Wes Brown, Djimi Traore, Alberto Moreno won a CL final, Vincent Kompany, Toby Alderweireld and Kalidou Koulibaly have not. Enough said about trophies when a lot of players didnt contribute to winning something. Accolade merchants

[2022-12-28 14:37:37] <%+tunined> in an era where you could smoke and drink like crazy.. no way those players could do that now
[2022-12-28 14:37:39] <+J4CK23_> bit like u then stokes

[2022-12-28 14:37:50] <tcosta_26> @jsharpp all good, Porto win today and life is good, lose points and life is shit, simple as that
[2022-12-28 14:37:53] <+mattjohnstone82> My old man still maintains best is clear of them all
[2022-12-28 14:38:04] <CalvinHeer> Is Nkunku worth 1.8m to play ST? Or is there better options
[2022-12-28 14:38:05] <%drastreal2710> R9, Messi, Maradona top 3 raw talent wise
[2022-12-28 14:38:12] <x_JWM_x> @treiks_ it is to old i ask for 41212
[2022-12-28 14:38:13] <+aranthewindowcleaner> I don‚Äôt see how any single player can be ‚Äòthe best‚Äô, football is a team game at the end of the day.
[2022-12-28 14:38:14] <@%+JSharpp> @tcosta_26 i'm a simple man too i just want stokes to lose this game

[2022-12-28 14:38:16] <%+Setx> My father say Cruyff is the most underrated player in history of football
[2022-12-28 14:38:22] <+J4CK23_> The new oxford guy is very good his 6 foot 4 height is OP
[2022-12-28 14:38:37] <macbeards> @hashtag_stokes my grandma grew up with George best when she was little up in Ireland he‚Äôs mum and dad had a Chippy , he was a ladies boy then and just wanted girls and beer when he grew up he wasn‚Äôt interested as much in football ‚öΩÔ∏è such a shame man as he has so much talent too
[2022-12-28 14:38:37] <%+tunined> irs 100% nostalgia
[2022-12-28 14:38:43] <player2162> pele had the most individual talent
[2022-12-28 14:38:50] <+Yelsrow> Oxford would be great if they kept his position as CB
[2022-12-28 14:38:51] <SantiAckerman> Messi is better than all of em
[2022-12-28 14:38:53] <CalvinHeer> Stokes thoughts on the guy you played Aqib-II the other day
[2022-12-28 14:38:57] <hellowhat86> my dad old af and got so happy for messi this world cup, shit was emotional xd he seen all the legends
[2022-12-28 14:38:58] <+singo30> Al owairan and WW Laca, or Gold Mbappe and IF Ousmane?
[2022-12-28 14:38:59] <+J4CK23_> yh Im using him over Matthaus atm
[2022-12-28 14:39:02] <fx1476> anyone know when jairzinho sbc is coming out??
[2022-12-28 14:39:02] <mambostylee> for me, i loved zidane
[2022-12-28 14:39:03] <+relmasss> oxford just winning every corner usually never score of em either
[2022-12-28 14:39:06] <+lEninpApA> Pusk√°s and the hungarian gold team was the first big impact in the football i think ^^ Nr. 10 shirt by Pusk√°s since that
[2022-12-28 14:39:08] <+sceinz> Messi is no 1 for natural talent no debate
[2022-12-28 14:39:09] <+brandz_akh007> Got gravenberch untradable but im finding it hard to link him because i like skillers
[2022-12-28 14:39:15] <tcosta_26> @jsharpp don‚Äôt think will happen, but If u want I can snipe him Kappa
[2022-12-28 14:39:16] <%AussieRig> dinho the most skillful by a long shot
[2022-12-28 14:39:16] <%Petrodoggz> its all personal preference too and who you watch and support and whose style you enjoy
[2022-12-28 14:39:18] <%drastreal2710> Man's rapid

[2022-12-28 14:39:23] <+Enu_Macchie> messi and cr7s consistency just put them in greater tiers than ronaldinho
[2022-12-28 14:39:26] <%+tunined> my problem with Dinho is its just the same old youtube clips every single time
[2022-12-28 14:39:29] <+ttvsirfurnish> raul was a great allso
[2022-12-28 14:39:32] <+singo30> Kaka was nuts
[2022-12-28 14:39:33] <+tonykc3> i been waching fifa since  90 i never seen a player like r9
[2022-12-28 14:39:35] <%+tunined> watch a full game and you will understand why dinho is not top 10 ever
[2022-12-28 14:39:36] <cj_nsza> kaka goal vs man united at old trafford
[2022-12-28 14:39:37] <+america111222> ruud van nistelrooij was crazy as wel
[2022-12-28 14:39:38] <+aranthewindowcleaner> Kaka was class
[2022-12-28 14:39:41] <+LEGENDSISMADE> Dinho wasnt that good,all modern guys are better messi,ronaldo
[2022-12-28 14:39:42] <+tonykc3> kaka was fenomenal ea dont have clueee
[2022-12-28 14:39:43] <GB68> Rio and Brown I think
