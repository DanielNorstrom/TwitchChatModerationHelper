[2022-12-08 01:31:52] <%$KaocydeJarvinen> @gingerthoroughbread DMC started as a Resident Evil spin-off, before devs realized he was way too powerful for the RE universe. Then they made it it's own series, but the old school RE fixed camera angles remained.

[2022-12-08 03:27:50] <%Drachen_Toter> RE0 and RE1 had issues with the camera angles as well. I'm glad the camera angles have gotten better with games over the years.
[2022-12-08 03:27:56] <%Pythia_Archana> sounds good. its an old game so a lot of annoying old mechanics
[2022-12-08 03:28:10] <%haiddon> I know that 5 has the fixed camera, I'm not certain about 4 though
[2022-12-08 03:28:19] <%antroz93> tptally understandable
[2022-12-08 03:28:21] <Chrisld10> I think 4 has a bit of fixed camera but 5 is more free camera

[2022-12-08 03:29:16] <%Pythia_Archana> no but its also a capcom game. same company
[2022-12-08 03:29:29] <@%SharkBiteREM> DMC 1 was, but through the character developement they realized he was too op for the plot, so they made an entirely new story
[2022-12-08 03:29:32] <%Drachen_Toter> The original was locked camera.
[2022-12-08 03:29:35] <%haiddon> yeah, they were making a resident evil game, but kept having ideas for flashy and stylish attacks, so they shelved that resident evil, and instead made dmc
[2022-12-08 03:29:36] <%GingerThoroughBread> LUL RE1 was something special for a lot of reasons
[2022-12-08 03:29:38] <%ceazoul> It was developed around the same time as RE4 if I remember correctly.

[2022-12-08 03:30:10] <%GingerThoroughBread> PauseChamp so is that the new tank?

[2022-12-08 03:47:04] <%+OrphanCain> you were doing your job, but your team died before you did and you kept holding until they killed you and forced a stager
[2022-12-08 03:47:18] <%Pythia_Archana> @Morpheuss__ she can almost one shot you and her base dmg is higher so her dps actually got higher and her ult got stronger too

[2022-12-08 04:48:04] <that_one_ginger_boy> also the new push map sucks so much for the attack side
[2022-12-08 04:48:09] <$AbbyssalChimera> Old Resi games took a bit for me to get used to with the controls, but I'll take the OG controls over camera relevant controls

[2022-12-08 06:37:59] <%acupcak3> you could abuse his rapid fire since it had no recoil

[2022-12-08 08:44:46] <@%AJ_Hyper_Bit> since twitch doesn't provide any because of the buisness model, it is up to Egg (or if Egg would be able to create a company after getting enough income) it is up to Egg or the company to provide the insurance @nemafow if that makes sense how I explained it
[2022-12-08 08:45:13] <@%AJ_Hyper_Bit> or just suffer being uninsured

[2022-12-08 09:54:28] <%+Ache431> yea the camera angles in those games are oof
[2022-12-08 09:54:32] <%BobaManZz> devil may cry 4 should be better

[2022-12-08 09:54:43] <%operatorviera> fixed camera angles really do suck
[2022-12-08 09:54:46] <%+Ache431> thank god it isn't the old Resident evils LUL
[2022-12-08 09:54:57] <%+Ache431> those camera angles would make you scream
[2022-12-08 09:54:59] <%+KingSora08> DMC3 is hands down the best.

[2022-12-08 09:55:40] <%+bouncy_knight00> Capcom has to finish remastering all the RE games first lol
[2022-12-08 09:55:53] VIEWERS: 340
[2022-12-08 09:55:58] <%operatorviera> So if we get you to 3k subs you will play all the old resident evil games? Kappa
[2022-12-08 09:56:14] <%+Ache431> hopefully they don't fuck up 4 LUL
[2022-12-08 09:56:18] <%warwwolf91> 5 is my favorite, also the Behind the scenes  stuff was top tier comedy gold
[2022-12-08 09:56:19] <%+KingSora08> Oh BTW, I was told to tell you I was sent to your stream by Girlswearbeanies
[2022-12-08 09:56:49] <%+Ache431> played 2's remakes, and it's good
[2022-12-08 09:56:57] <%+KingSora08> 2 & 3 remake are really good.
[2022-12-08 09:57:09] <%+bouncy_knight00> Code Veronica exists  probab62Bonk
[2022-12-08 09:57:39] <%+bouncy_knight00> 5 was monumental
[2022-12-08 09:57:41] <%+Ache431> we talking re4??

[2022-12-08 09:58:38] <%warwwolf91> RE5 was fun for the co op, 6 not so much
[2022-12-08 09:58:43] <%+KingSora08> DMC 5 is really great. I'd argue that 3, 5 and that weird remake one are the best out of the DMC series.
[2022-12-08 09:58:45] <%BobaManZz> Stare
[2022-12-08 09:58:49] <%+bouncy_knight00> what we actually need from Capcom is MegaMan X9
[2022-12-08 09:59:01] <%+Ache431> I've played it 20 times and i enjoy it everytime
[2022-12-08 09:59:04] <%BobaManZz> no YOU'RE wrong
[2022-12-08 09:59:09] <%operatorviera> fat nuts? you might wanna get that checked at the doctors Heavenly
[2022-12-08 09:59:11] <%BobaManZz> Hmm
[2022-12-08 09:59:24] <%+KingSora08> RE4 is amazing! Has garbage controls but is a fantastic revolutionary game.
[2022-12-08 09:59:30] <%warwwolf91> RE4 is amazing and I played it a few months back
[2022-12-08 09:59:53] VIEWERS: 336
[2022-12-08 10:00:02] <%ceazoul> It depends what you look for in a RE game.
[2022-12-08 10:00:03] <%ceazoul> If you care about things  like puzzles and the horror elements of the older games, 4, 5 and 6 will not appeal to some older fans.
[2022-12-08 10:00:17] <%BobaManZz> Stare
[2022-12-08 10:00:24] <!%BasilWoof> LMAO

[2022-12-08 10:00:47] <!%BasilWoof> RE4 seems to be the Ocarina of Time of RE
[2022-12-08 10:00:51] <!%BasilWoof> insanely divisive now
[2022-12-08 10:00:56] <%warwwolf91> tbh 4 is bad horror game, but a fun action game
[2022-12-08 10:01:01] <zeussmitethee> so skill issues
[2022-12-08 10:01:04] <%ceazoul> Fundamentally the experiences of the games did take a notable shift and that can alienate players.
[2022-12-08 10:01:11] <@%SharkBiteREM> i liked 5 the most honestly
[2022-12-08 10:01:14] <%+Ache431> PREACH HEAVENLY
[2022-12-08 10:01:14] <%BobaManZz> @warwwolf91 I can agree with this
[2022-12-08 10:01:20] <!%BasilWoof> it was for a time Heavenly
[2022-12-08 10:01:28] <@%SharkBiteREM> if you had a good friend to play it with it was the best
[2022-12-08 10:01:32] <%BobaManZz> YES, PLAY IT
[2022-12-08 10:01:33] <%operatorviera> is it bad that i have never played a Resident Evil game?
