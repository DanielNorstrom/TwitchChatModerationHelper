[2023-01-08 00:36:06] <%Curiousitori> depends if they can do it
[2023-01-08 00:36:09] <shadyy128> Dont think so
[2023-01-08 00:36:14] <%Blueotter316> streamer is always the igl niamocStare
[2023-01-08 00:36:15] <%Elzeha> if theyw ant to do it
[2023-01-08 00:36:19] <%Elzeha> sure
[2023-01-08 00:36:19] <%+cnch> i think u gotta atleast "play" with the streamer
[2023-01-08 00:36:20] <shadyy128> Whoever can I think thats who should do it imo
[2023-01-08 00:36:22] <%+cnch> not land in narnia
[2023-01-08 00:36:33] <%Elzeha> ah that yes
[2023-01-08 00:36:34] <%Elzeha> for sure
[2023-01-08 00:36:38] <%ColdButch_Winter> Not automatically, but I think they should get to choose if they want to igl or not
[2023-01-08 00:36:39] <9ninetails3> my personal opinion: the igl will indeed be the igl NODDERS
[2023-01-08 00:36:41] <KevinMask> I will say yeah. Streamer is IGL unless you vote someone else to be one.
[2023-01-08 00:37:22] <shadyy128> It MIGHT make the games smoother but if the streamer wants to have control I'm not opposed to that
[2023-01-08 00:37:47] <AkkiSakurai> idk igl is more so whoever "speaks" or gives the first suggestion lol
[2023-01-08 00:37:54] <AkkiSakurai> thatys how i do it

[2023-01-08 04:59:39] <%SwitchOfChaos> @SwitchOfChaos well so all traffic is a roundabout starts with entry from the rightmost side. You either turn right go straight or follow the roundabout around in a left turn. The people I'm talking about don't go around the roundabout they make a left turn that goes directly against the flow of traffic. Instead of going around at a 270 degree angle they take a 90 degree left turn
