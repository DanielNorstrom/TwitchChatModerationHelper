[2022-12-15 21:05:45] <%SunlightOnTheMorningTide> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.

[2022-12-15 23:31:37] <luongshar> it's lazy but there's people better at it than others, it's not entirely passive
[2022-12-15 23:31:49] <wuhn9ne> reaction content and commentary content are different though

[2022-12-15 23:33:34] <%Zayevv> I just hate when I see a reddit post of a meme where also a person is on the side just looking at it not even reacting to it
