[2022-12-15 20:49:44] <@%^StreamElements>* I am a 45 year old lumberjack residing in the woods, chopping trees while living a humble and honest life. Unfortunately, this life is not sustainable anymore.. I decided to look for a job in the city and found out COVID is a thing. This can't be it.. that's impossible! I'm scared, terrified and unemployed. I resort to a life on the internet as a VTuber.. with a voice changer. Yes, it is fake. My entire life is a lie just like Chi.
