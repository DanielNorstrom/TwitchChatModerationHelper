[2023-01-04 09:22:16] <%destinien19> Castform has Huge Power, so it is technically an illegal run, but the community is discussing the Huge Power rule for gen 5 specifically soon methinks. It had powerful physical moves at the end, and he could have died at least 3 times due to plenty of mons having abilities that either take away Huge Power, or make the mons formidable opponents with scary strength (Transform, Trace) or just plain physical walls (combo of good defense and maybe Multiscale).

[2023-01-04 09:43:21] <Kappatechy> Bulbapedia says: If the Pokémon affected by Encore runs out of PP for the affected move, the effects of Encore end immediately. If the move the Pokémon is locked into by Encore is disabled, the Pokémon will be forced to use Struggle until the effects of Disable or Encore have worn off.

[2023-01-04 09:44:00] <Kappatechy> Encore/Torment have a rude interaction as well, forcing Struggle every second turn.
[2023-01-04 09:44:16] <%berniebeatsboxes> Also the revamped Omega/Alpha soundtrack slaps too
[2023-01-04 09:44:20] <@%Shayy> I believe Meteor Falls is the intended loop, yeah.

[2023-01-04 09:44:25] <Idixal> @kembro true, but since you don’t pick movesets, and Arcanine doesn’t learn any, this is pretty damn near perfect

[2023-01-04 10:03:40] <Thalfon> @TsadiqP It starts at 2/2, and each attack boost raises the numerator. So 6 boosts is 8/2, or 4x.

[2023-01-04 10:19:40] <%berniebeatsboxes> How lenient is the ironmon community when it comes to those sorts of mistakes

[2023-01-04 10:19:57] <+Happy__Kitty> damn. looks like resettung before they where handed back made me miss out. back to lurk. thanks @carlobrown 😊
[2023-01-04 10:20:06] <%Myrral> Why is it alive undersells my question, but yes
[2023-01-04 10:20:13] <+stellarsophia0> pretty lenient from what i see @berniebeatsboxes
[2023-01-04 10:20:15] <Raelcun> I mean some people are probably weird about it, but ironmon is a challenge run anyway
[2023-01-04 10:20:20] <Raelcun> don't do it on purpose and I don't think anyone cares
[2023-01-04 10:20:22] <%berniebeatsboxes> That's good to hear.
[2023-01-04 10:20:34] <@%CarloBrown> tghThat
[2023-01-04 10:20:41] <Raelcun> like I said some peopel are weird about it
[2023-01-04 10:20:52] <thelargeone> it lives because it's got defenses. it only hits like a wet paper towel :)
[2023-01-04 10:21:03] <Raelcun> adef did an exhibition with some mewtwo runs on hotfix and so many epople sounded legitimately offended at the /cheating/
[2023-01-04 10:21:05] <%berniebeatsboxes> It's not meant to be a competitive challenge at face value, more just a way to challenge the runner.
[2023-01-04 10:21:09] <Raelcun> and he was still getting rocked by RNG lol
[2023-01-04 10:21:24] <+stellarsophia0> im pretty sure pie has said that if you accidentally break a rule and gain something from it, its up to the player to decide on something to counteract it, like trash an heal or skip a trainer or smthn
[2023-01-04 10:21:29] <Thalfon> Seems to me a personal challenge should be whatever the heck you decide it to be lol
[2023-01-04 10:21:31] <+stellarsophia0> but i may be wrong

[2023-01-04 10:22:26] <%berniebeatsboxes> Yeah most of the people who stream ironmon seem to be really cool people and have very similar energies to Teej
[2023-01-04 10:22:31] <%Rootballa> sticklers for someone else's rules
[2023-01-04 10:22:33] <%berniebeatsboxes> At least from what I've seen

[2023-01-04 10:25:41] <Raelcun> The biggest nuzlocke content creators all play hardcore rules but also tell all their viewers to play how they find enjoyable. It's always just the random commentators taking it too seriously

[2023-01-04 10:30:18] <%berniebeatsboxes> Kappa250 I mean, in our fire red and leaf green runs we pretty much only made it to the E4 with tanky mons until HookyDuck. Maybe that trend will continue in Emerald? We shall see. Also imagine a water variant of this mon called Aquanine. Just sayin
[2023-01-04 10:30:31] <@%Taco_Champ> would you battle me, Teej?
[2023-01-04 10:30:31] <n_g_da> @stellarsophia0 I think not simply because the game ends with e4, and there is no Steven-esque figure at the end with lvl 100s
[2023-01-04 10:30:35] <@%Taco_Champ> In real combat.
[2023-01-04 10:30:58] <+stellarsophia0> so thats the difference, theres no steven in r/s
[2023-01-04 10:31:07] <Thalfon> Surely a water version of this mon would be a sharkanine
[2023-01-04 10:31:08] <@%fsvgm777> A mon with paltry offense.
[2023-01-04 10:31:14] <Raelcun> I mean you still have dragon dance
[2023-01-04 10:31:14] <%berniebeatsboxes> Yeah the tanky kingdras were amazing
[2023-01-04 10:31:24] <Raelcun> Dragon dance with tanky stats fixes a lot of sins
[2023-01-04 10:31:36] <%Mirby_Studios> fucking attack? is that a third attack stat alongside normal and special?
[2023-01-04 10:31:37] <Raelcun> there's a reason that dragon dance is top tier

[2023-01-04 10:57:37] <%$Varldin> yeah it's weird because politoed doesn't learn moves once it evolves, but Slowking does

[2023-01-04 10:59:54] <+stellarsophia0> ok, so how does evolving porygon in ironmon work
[2023-01-04 10:59:56] <n_g_da> wow this dude
[2023-01-04 10:59:57] <@%fsvgm777> Get blasted, Tentacruel.

[2023-01-04 11:00:05] <@%DukeFireBird> one could argue that porygon only evolves once by trade
[2023-01-04 11:00:05] <%+SirDeathly> I would love to see this modified where woopers are renamed to "this"
[2023-01-04 11:00:09] <%Rootballa> it's extremely funny to me that you evolve porygon2 by shoving a counterfeit TM into its back

[2023-01-04 11:00:10] <@%fsvgm777> Works too.
[2023-01-04 11:00:10] <@%DukeFireBird> cause then its Porygon2
[2023-01-04 11:00:20] <xts93> tentacruel will be a massive problem at lvl 80
[2023-01-04 11:00:31] <%berniebeatsboxes> I love the typhlosion plush
[2023-01-04 11:00:39] <MatthiasVonWells> i think its just for parity between the 2 evos, slowking gets to learn moves because bro learned moves in gen 1 but polis other evo is a stone so it gets the no move treatment
[2023-01-04 11:01:04] <Raelcun> Sleep time for me, good luck with this extremely mon of all time

[2023-01-04 11:18:25] <%+cb_longneck> its max = 165
[2023-01-04 11:18:28] <+jman2050> Current HP
[2023-01-04 11:18:30] <$Seviryn> less than 165
[2023-01-04 11:18:32] <Kappatechy> Pain Split sums your two HP values, and gives you each half... dropping any excess on the ground.
[2023-01-04 11:18:34] <%Rootballa> pain split adds your current hp to their current hp, divides it by 2, and gives each of you that # of hp i think?
[2023-01-04 11:18:40] <$Seviryn> 165 is half the total of their HP
[2023-01-04 11:18:44] <$Seviryn> Clefable has less than 165 HP
[2023-01-04 11:18:45] <@%DukeFireBird> Pain Split adds the current HP of the user and target Pokémon. It then divides this value by two and sets the HP of both Pokémon to the result (limited by each Pokémon's maximum HP)
[2023-01-04 11:18:48] <%XSlicer> its _not_ percentagewise
[2023-01-04 11:19:00] <$Seviryn> Because you lost HP, but Clefable did not
[2023-01-04 11:19:01] <%+theSkyfisher> it's max is less than 165 so since cleffable couldn't go above it's max the last time it did less this time
[2023-01-04 11:19:10] <+jman2050> your HP was lower the second time
[2023-01-04 11:19:17] <+jman2050> So the sum is lower
[2023-01-04 11:19:20] <$Seviryn> so if it used Pain Split again, you have less HP, so half of the total is less
[2023-01-04 11:19:22] <%Rootballa> because the first time it had X + 220, and the second time it had X + 190 or whatever the numbers were
[2023-01-04 11:19:35] <%Pitici> She still had less HP than you
[2023-01-04 11:19:48] <$Seviryn> it would eventually converge to Clefable's total HP
[2023-01-04 11:19:51] <%Rootballa> technically we could solve for x but it's 5:19 am and i'm not solving shit
[2023-01-04 11:20:06] <%Izzy_The_Penguin> Clefable had barely any max HP is the real lesson to learn there
[2023-01-04 11:20:08] <%+theSkyfisher> i mean you mathed her to about 140 HP so like that would be about right
[2023-01-04 11:20:13] <$Seviryn> I think that would be mathamatical integration and I'm not about to get into that
[2023-01-04 11:20:19] <@%DukeFireBird> 175 pending max
[2023-01-04 11:20:19] <%Heparoo> Thats cause at full health on the mon using it, it leaves you at higher health than their max.
[2023-01-04 11:20:22] VIEWERS: 613
[2023-01-04 11:20:37] <%Cytyzent> say you have 200 hp, and they have 100, the first time would be 300/2 = 150, you'd be at 150. next time you have 150, they still have 100, so it would be 250/2, so 125
[2023-01-04 11:20:40] <%+theSkyfisher> eventually if no one is doing damage you would reach the pokes with the least max hp
[2023-01-04 11:20:52] <$Seviryn> Ye

[2023-01-04 11:21:00] <%CdudeGamer42> It would eventually approach 150, yeah.

[2023-01-04 11:21:37] <%Rootballa> 150 is the lower bound yeah
[2023-01-04 11:21:42] <@%Taco_Champ> I mean like 15 + 15 is 30, and 16 + 16 is 30 too

[2023-01-04 11:40:47] <blindeye_ent> is it true that rare candy lvling gives you less than regularly lvling?
[2023-01-04 11:41:10] <Cariyaga> abandoned power plant, iirc
[2023-01-04 11:41:20] <blindeye_ent> yes less EV's
[2023-01-04 11:41:20] <%0ldmanbiff> you don't get EVs, but this part of the game that doesn't matter
[2023-01-04 11:41:24] <%Rootballa> @blindeye_ent you don't gain any DVs (gen 1) or EVs if you only level with rare candies, but you cap on those normally

[2023-01-04 11:41:54] <Finngus> New Mauville was supposed to be an entire underground city but they abandoned the project
[2023-01-04 11:42:03] <blindeye_ent> okay so I was partially correct... it was just a rumor I heard a very long time ago
[2023-01-04 11:42:08] <+GabEsteves> let me refresh twitch to see the ads, brb
[2023-01-04 11:42:10] <Nyancy_Cat> if you just use a few rare candies it doesnt change anything
[2023-01-04 11:42:17] <%Rootballa> yeah it's a true rumor from the very early generations

[2023-01-04 11:42:34] <%Rootballa> if you got a pokemon to level 100 with just rare candies it'd be missing stats, and you couldn't fix it at first
[2023-01-04 11:42:50] <Nyancy_Cat> the "rumor" probably started because of the rare candy dupe glitch in gen 1
[2023-01-04 11:43:09] <Ionic_Iris> @nyancy_cat it started from ingame text
[2023-01-04 11:43:20] <Nyancy_Cat> people took fresh mons to 100 instantly and noticed they were weaker than other pokemon

[2023-01-04 13:28:56] <Lurane> teleport would only be an issue if you use it to exit a dungeon and it brings you backward so youd reenter a place (at the point it wouldnt, you prob have fly anyways)

[2023-01-04 14:49:17] <%ESKN> perfect (sand)storm
[2023-01-04 14:49:24] <%Kailaria> one interesting thing to note that I recall from a previous stream: all gen 3 trainers have mon genders that match the trainer's presented gender, so attraction is more of a concern against trainers whose gender doesn't match your mon's..?

[2023-01-04 14:53:53] <@%fsvgm777> It's really more Sand Stream that killed the run.
[2023-01-04 14:53:55] <%Syrinius> did you have any pp heals?
[2023-01-04 14:54:08] <%TheArtGremblin> Man, perpetual chip damage really sucks in kaizo.
[2023-01-04 14:54:09] <joshi9292> can you check the first mons ability? Because it never missed, maybe it had compound eyes
[2023-01-04 14:54:23] <Nyancy_Cat> oh yeah check muk for acc?
[2023-01-04 14:54:36] <kotomikun> sand stream, amnesia when the only usable move is fire, plus cute charm. jeez
[2023-01-04 14:54:40] <justcallmecore> Did you overlook the Super Potion or was there a reason you couldn't use it? Or are my glasses broken?

[2023-01-04 14:55:01] <%+flimmsovan> was a nice experience at the end; and a huuuge loss of points
