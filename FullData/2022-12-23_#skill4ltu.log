It's probably the result of the frenzy of pre-Christmas shopping ...

[2022-12-23 12:15:11] <big_moon123> @captainvgod A redditor under the nickname denierCZ from the European region decided to collect statistics from 50,000 replays, and then analyzed them using a small Python script.  As a result, he got statistics from the TOP-30 most profitable / costly tanks.  The author himself claims that he did this only because the developers of the PC version of the game do not disclose at least the percentage yield of each tank, as they do on consoles.

[2022-12-23 13:07:16] <SGallay> no
[2022-12-23 13:07:16] <IulyAlb> @skill4ltu your body creates antibodies from the vaccine and you are somehow protected
[2022-12-23 13:07:16] <%swgchef> wife got flu shot and yes, she was sicker than getting the flu
[2022-12-23 13:07:16] <eupotter> right after you take it you might get a bit sick if your immune system is bad
[2022-12-23 13:07:21] <bejay2013> i got them every year. they are against the 4 most dominant flu-lines and you will not get it as hard as without. after the flu shot i felt 1 day like a soft flu, than it was nothing

[2022-12-23 13:07:21] <vasan192> its the same with covid shot, some ppl react strongly to it some dont at all, most ppl have no reaction or only a small one
[2022-12-23 13:07:22] <1carus1_> there are many different strains of flu - the vaccination prevents you getting (~100 strains). when you have the flu shot then you might have a mild cold like symptoms
[2022-12-23 13:07:22] <%Gudeblin> no
[2022-12-23 13:07:24] <oTOKEo> it effects everyone differently

[2022-12-23 13:07:26] <MatzaGigi> Depending of your body, flu shots will either help you during the flu, either be totally imune.
[2022-12-23 13:07:26] <tenk33> thoose shots are only good for the flu of the last year. the actuall flu is a new "mutant" of the flus of the other years.
[2022-12-23 13:07:28] <niko_879> take vitamin d, c
[2022-12-23 13:07:29] <%+Tartopom__> Took it 2 days ago, Nop, just like a bruise, no more @skill4ltu
[2022-12-23 13:07:30] <%+Branthopolis> There are lots of strains of the flu.  Each year they make an educated guess as to which strains of flu to cover with the shot.   Sometimes they get it right.  SOmetimes they get it wrong..  There is NO shot that will 100% stop you from getting the flu... Same as covid.

[2022-12-23 16:55:09] <%+Vulgis> @skill4ltu Besides the default challenge of marking to 100%, IMO you have an extra problem here which is the fact that during the holiday ops most games are Blitz. That makes things a lot harder for marking.

[2022-12-23 18:20:08] <%LipniJuosta> balance of maps matters less, when players are not familiar with the map (new maps). Now, players know all positions on all maps, making map balance a bigger issue.

[2022-12-23 19:51:02] <%+Rocksmo> @SadFaceOfBannedUser It makes the game much easier since mapawareness is much less important on todays map. That might be good for the casual player but very bad for actually experienced and skilled players.

[2022-12-23 21:06:14] <%$snausages32> @skill4ltu the aiming on the arcade mode will drive you insane
[2022-12-23 21:06:14] <%BlackSeaLTD> @spartans_kill same here .... it gits ground or shots like an AA in the air
[2022-12-23 21:06:16] <+Drachwill> take japanese HT and play like arty with autoaim

[2022-12-23 21:06:43] <%haevun> This mode is stupid - BZ autoaim and shoot over hills
[2022-12-23 21:06:45] <+M_tos> @skill4ltu Whoa, I have a great idea, WG should make the new tank: BZ with 150mm autocannon - so same tank but with super high rof Kappa
[2022-12-23 21:06:51] <%+tarogaming08> your projectile are curving

[2022-12-23 21:08:39] <%Maitner_> @skill4ltu I think that also game contains too many ways for a tank to just die for a single mistake and if 2 people on one side will make these mistakes it will snowball into 15-5
[2022-12-23 21:08:46] <+M_tos> @SharpTiger131 even better idea :)

[2022-12-23 21:09:41] <%haevun> @skill4ltu I think because of the Curve and you pen the top
[2022-12-23 21:09:41] <%bouros1> and the shots are curved
[2022-12-23 21:09:44] <%+dantherapper> -25% to standard
[2022-12-23 21:09:46] <+S1ngularity_xD> shrek pens everything
[2022-12-23 21:09:52] <%fitness_tank> HE better pen, normal ammo lower pen
[2022-12-23 21:09:52] <%+klecha_> its kinda old HE
[2022-12-23 21:09:53] <+dreadlast> ƒ∞TS  like old HE 60 tp hits 500 when not penning @skill4ltu
[2022-12-23 21:09:55] <trikolkata> LUL
[2022-12-23 21:10:00] <%bouros1> so if you have high ground and shoot someone you can pen on the top of the turret

[2022-12-23 21:30:49] <@%Basleader92> @lektryx it has no influence, if 10000 people play the same tank, and 2 or 3 of them are CC's using a full skilled crew etc, they have no influence on the requirements at all

[2022-12-23 21:37:24] <!%Sgt_Fuzzy_Boots> @doka_kg There will always be a certain amount of 15 to (2 - 7) victorys because of a combat law called Lanchesters Square Law.

[2022-12-23 21:37:40] <@%Basleader92> @Greek_Force that's how I played it, mainly used HEAT and played it as a TD, for me that worked fine

[2022-12-23 21:37:42] <+lektryx> @sim6mon  I feel that an average is calculated with both best and worst games of the day my friend.  That is how the math happens :)  If CC accounts change the max, it will change the average.

[2022-12-23 21:40:54] <+lektryx> @Basleader92 so, then make it fairer.  Give them the 'average' of credits and 'average' of bonds, and they can have EVERY tank, but not 7 skill crews..

[2022-12-23 21:41:15] <%Maitner_> @skill4ltu I think he was kinda going over with his point but cutting MM from =/- 2 to +/- 1 and maybe cutting down artas to only 1 per battle would help a lot with enjoyment
[2022-12-23 21:41:18] <%Mr_Gallade_> They should stop inflating dpm. Because of the ridiculous dpm of every tank the games last 4 min

[2022-12-23 21:42:15] <%+bechems> theres not much can be done as a lot of tanks are balanced/released on a basis of how reliable they can be penetrated with premium ammo, otherwise entire game would have to be changed from ground up you cant do that to 10 year old game

[2022-12-23 22:10:50] <%Maitner_> @david_remete That is quite untrue tho ... Skoda is not VZ 55, it has interclip reload of 3.5 sec that means that you cannot just peak and deal 800, also Skoda has less gun depression, and more pronounce weak points aka commanders hatch and lower plate, vs BZ you just have to overmatch the top and if you have too low caliber ... good luck

[2022-12-23 22:43:08] <%+danhelsing74> maybe elon musk will buy it
[2022-12-23 22:43:20] <o_g_re_2020> rng and +2 MM ballances BZ pretty well in my opinion... one game you hit every shot and do EZ 4-6k dmg ... next game you hit nothing or only crit and end with 1k dmg .... all fine @skill4ltu
[2022-12-23 22:43:22] <%+eagletroop> @VladimirDinu they learned from super pershing mistake and kv5 one when they tried changing pref mm
[2022-12-23 22:43:26] <%1945JB> nerfed on test sever view range,damage and speed.
[2022-12-23 22:43:29] <Nifty_Chicken17> but their has to be better ways to monetise the game without breaking it and ruining its long term balance eg cosmetics and skins
[2022-12-23 22:43:34] <+renpiti45> I would not be surprised if they make this game so goofy that they have to release two versions: World of Clown Tanks, and the World of Tanks Classic Edition. Just like cola companies.
[2022-12-23 22:43:34] <warbeastn> I agree wargaming has to make money but atleast balance and make it fair to free to play players.

[2022-12-23 22:45:00] <@%Basleader92> @warbeastn Only reason f2p players can play this game is because of people that buy prem tanks or prem days etc, WG isn't a charity and it's also costing them money to keep this game up and running plus they need to make a profit
[2022-12-23 22:45:05] <warbeastn> @renpiti45 but free to play is very important so that there is people
[2022-12-23 22:45:10] <rino944> @skill4ltu  i think everybody forgot the su-152 where you basically can troll everyone or the kv-2 days where every free2play account had one to farm credits
[2022-12-23 22:45:25] <ivcha23> if we as a community decided collectively to yolo these bz-s everywhere we see them in our tier X tanks, do you think it would reduce the amount people play bz?

[2022-12-23 22:45:28] <alexviewer> bad tank :d
[2022-12-23 22:45:31] <LeanBlanket> @o_g_re_2020 Man, for real, if you think that BZ is balanced, you know nothing about this game. No offense. You cannot say that this tank is balanced by mm, cause every other tank has same conditions. With difference, that BZ can F every other tier 8 tank.
[2022-12-23 22:45:38] <Anubis2610> Are you okay with your head? 13 hours hammering into tanks, make an appointment with the doctor later!
[2022-12-23 22:45:39] <%+Durmanush> 4k combined is better than some tier 10s
[2022-12-23 22:45:52] <drevo3> WG can save us from this tank with No-gold mod, where no gold ammo, no bounty equipment, no cola etc.
[2022-12-23 22:46:11] <+renpiti45> @warbeastn That's just a little gateway enticement. They don't have as much concern for ftp players. They are focused on paying customers.

[2022-12-23 22:47:27] <leonidaspag> if you think that tank ruined the event wait to see the tanks next year
[2022-12-23 22:47:30] <%$paranoid_custodian> BZ is a piece of shit that should be removed from the game, I cannot stress the enough.  it makes all tanks with little armour useless if there is a platoon of these kaks in the game

[2022-12-23 22:48:57] <o_g_re_2020> @LeanBlanket ever faced an arnie or anything you can not penetrate with 225 pen? .... every 130mm gun can easily overmatch your turret roof (e.g. skoda t56)
[2022-12-23 22:49:04] <stressed_fibber> im a noob why don't i see italian premium tanks in tech treeü§î
[2022-12-23 22:49:09] <+renpiti45> @warbeastn Very good point. What we CAN'T see is the financial difference that makes. Honestly, if there are a small number of paying customers who keep the lights on and pay the bills, is there a need to worry about non-paying customers? I agree with you, they SHOULD care because ftp players can turn into pay-to-play players. They may not see it that way...yet.
[2022-12-23 22:49:23] <warbeastn> @basleader92 its exactly because they ignored free to play and the balance.
[2022-12-23 22:49:31] <@%momix99> @o_g_re_2020 to be fair there arent that many 130mm guns in tier 8 D: at least among the heavies

[2022-12-23 22:50:08] <Nifty_Chicken17> @Basleader92 apologies this tank just makes my blood boil for the good of the game
[2022-12-23 22:50:08] <LeanBlanket> @o_g_re_2020 Sure, but majority of tier 8 doesn't have 130mm guns. 225 is easy to play with since majority tanks have cupola, not like this BZ. There is a reason why this tank has many 10k dmg + games and why many players have over 3300 dpg in it

[2022-12-23 22:54:10] <@%momix99> @greekbaboonovich nooo, i was in church practicing for a while. and then had to walk back to home sweet home :D
[2022-12-23 22:54:10] <drevo3> Worst thing is the cant nerf it because people spent tons of money to get it so WG should have to give your money back, like type59
[2022-12-23 22:54:14] <permatouching> 2.9 average
[2022-12-23 22:54:20] <%Mykthos> @skill4ltu ok 20 games 2 victories, alt+f4 let's do something else
[2022-12-23 22:54:23] <zsemle_csaszar> I guess Skoda T56 was the best tier 8 tank, and there comes the BZ
[2022-12-23 22:54:36] <+surykatkos> hey @skill4ltu , please pass my thanks to your Dad for 100% win ratio in 11 battles.
[2022-12-23 22:54:36] <BlueBaron777> I still play defend for credits
[2022-12-23 22:54:36] <warbeastn> But yea all i was saying is WG needs to improve the free to play experience so that new players dont quit and actually spend more time and they might eventually also spend money. Its better for them
[2022-12-23 22:54:36] <%greekbaboonovich> @momix99  how home sweet home is far from the church :O

Like i said after not playing for long time and coming back i really love the improvements and new changes to the game. I spent 200$ on Boxes and i used to be free to play.
